5000|$|Coated fabrics {{consist of}} a {{standard}} <b>uncoated</b> <b>fabric</b> with an opaque rubber backing applied {{to the rear of}} the fabric to provide improved light absorption. To create a coated fabric, a liquefied rubber polymer is applied in a single coat to an <b>uncoated</b> <b>fabric</b> and subsequently fused dry by means of a heated roller, in much the same way that a laser printer applies toner to a sheet of paper before fusing it dry. A fabric that has been through the coating process once is considered a [...] "1-pass-coated" [...] fabric, anecdotally referred to as [...] "dim-out" [...] or [...] "blackout" [...] because of the fabric's ability to absorb approximately 50-70% of a direct light source. To improve the light absorption of a fabric it is possible to re-coat a fabric up to a maximum of [...] "3-pass-coated", which is considered sufficient to block out 100% of a direct light source, hence such fabrics are referred to as [...] "blockout-coated".|$|E
50|$|The B-1 {{variant of}} test method puts {{membrane}} in {{direct contact with}} water while B-2 variant adds an ePTFE film between the water and the fabric. While B-2 is a good test, it eliminates the effect of fabric when {{in direct contact with}} water. When sweat condenses on the inside of a fabric with a hydrophilic laminate, the lamination will actively pull the water through the fabric reducing condensation. This can be a tremendous addition to the comfort of the user.The B-2 test is also best used for non-waterproof fabrics, so the water in the pan does not pass directly through the <b>uncoated</b> <b>fabric.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Maximum light {{absorption}} and heat insulation in a curtain is created through a lined curtain, which typically {{consists of an}} <b>uncoated</b> <b>fabric</b> at the front to provide {{the look and feel}} of the curtain, with a separate coated fabric attached at the rear to provide the insulative qualities. The coated fabric is typically referred to as a lining, which simply refers to a coated fabric that does not have any particular color or pattern. Curtains may be held back with tie-backs (a loop of cloth, cord, etc., placed around a curtain to hold it open to one side; typically passed through a ring on a hook attached to the wall, and fastened with a knot, button, or velcro; often adorned with tassels) or may be closed and opened with sticks called draw-pulls (rods made of plastic, wood, or metal that can be twisted and/or pulled) or curtain rods which are attached either to the runner or to the first hook. On some curtain rails/poles, there is a pulley system for opening and closing called a [...] "corded curtain track". The knobs at the end of these cords are called cord pulls or [...] "acorns". A roll-down or drop-down curtain has its fabric rolled around the curtain rod and is lowered down from above by a separate device (such as pictured at right) or by pulling the fabric itself, with curtains using the latter mechanism being called pull-down curtains.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Uncoated</b> <b>fabrics</b> {{provide the}} next level of heat {{insulation}} and light absorption. <b>Uncoated</b> <b>fabrics</b> constitute the vast majority of fabrics used in curtains, and are composed of a tightly woven fabric, most typically a cotton/polyester blend, which is mostly [...] when viewed in ambient light. <b>Uncoated</b> <b>fabrics</b> provide a reasonable level of heat insulation due to the tight weave of the fabric. However, the fabric itself is typically not thick enough to completely absorb strong light sources. As a result, when curtains made from <b>uncoated</b> <b>fabrics</b> are closed in an attempt to block out direct sunlight, light will still be visible through the curtain.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. This report {{presents the results}} of mechanical and ballistic tests on polyester and polyurethane-based composites of polypyrrole-coated S- 2 glass fabrics. The fabrics were obtained from the Milliken Research Corporation, Spartanburg, SC. The data support the proposition that the glass fibers are, at most, slightly damaged by the coating process that requires an acidic solution of pH 1. The mechanical properties of the interface between the glass fibers and the matrix resin are weakened by the presence of the polypyrrole coating in the polyester resin composites. As a consequence, the tensile, compressive, flexure, and short-beam-shear strengths are all lower than comparable composites made with <b>uncoated</b> <b>fabrics.</b> The ballistic properties of the polypyrrole-coated-fabric polyester resin composites are as good or perhaps even slightly better, however, as a result of increased delamination. The tensile strengths of the polypyrrole-coated-fabric polyurethane composites were slightly higher than for similar composites made with <b>uncoated</b> <b>fabrics,</b> although the flexural modulus was not changed. The tensile strength of the polypyrrole-coated fabrics was also measured and found to be about 20 % higher than comparable amino-silane-sized fabrics, apparently {{as a consequence of the}} increased lubricity of the polypyrrole-coated fibers. i...|$|R

The {{effect of the}} nature of PUD, number of coatings, incorporation of additives, and processing conditions on the breathable properties of cotton fabric was evaluated. The relative proportions of hydrophilic and hydrophobic components had a direct influence on the breathable properties of the coated cotton samples. The increase in hydrophilic component resulted in an increased water vapor penetration and lower water resista-nce to water penetration in the coated samples. For all the compositions, the durabi-lity of the coatings was found to improve with the incorporation of polymeric binder in the coating formulation.

PEG- 600 (Mw) was encapsulated using an in-situ polymerization technique in an oil-in water emulsion with encapsulating water-immiscible liquid by the reaction of urea with formaldehyde at acidic pH. Both FTIR analysis and DSC studies verified the formation of PEG microcapsules (MC). Melting temperature (Tm) of the microcapsules was found approximately 21 °C which was the same as neat PEG. The heat storage capacity of these MCs was determined to be 12. 78 J/g by DSC analysis. FTIR analysis of the MCs exhibited the peaks at 3211 cm﹣ 1 , 1650 cm﹣ 1 , and 1400 cm﹣ 1 . These are the characteristic absorption peaks of -NH 2 , -C=O stretching and -CH bending vibrations, respectively.

The {{results showed that}} the CNF/PVDF-HFP coated on cotton fabrics had higher tensile strength than the <b>uncoated</b> cotton <b>fabric.</b> Comparing the various patterns, the tensile strengths of P 7, P 5, and P 3 were 8.31  ±  0.09, 8.25  ±  0.40, and 7.98  ±  0.39  N, respectively; for 2 P 7, 2 P 5, and 2 P 3 it was shown as 8.91  ±  0.33, 8.40  ±  0.18, and 8.28  ±  0.58  N, respectively. It is confirmed that the ultimate strength of carbon nanocomposite coated on cotton fabrics tends to be similar. The tensile strength of 2 P 7, 2 P 5, and 2 P 3 was slightly larger than that of P 7, P 5, and P 3, indicating that the tensile strength increases as the number of lines coated with the CNF/PVDF-HFP composite increases. And the elongation of <b>uncoated</b> cotton <b>fabric</b> was 4.76  ±  2.83 % and P 0 was 13.48  ±  1.20 %, which was about 3 times increased.

40|$|In this paper, an {{intumescent}} {{flame retardant}} treatment, obtained {{by a combination}} of vinylphosphonic acid (VPA) and methacrylamide (MAA), was applied to cotton fabrics. In order to improve the cross-linking degree onto cellulose polymers, potassium persulfate was used as initiator of a radical polymerization technique. The application on cotton was carried out by padding, followed by drying and a curing treatment. The treated samples were characterized by SEM, TGA and FTIR-ATR analyses and tested in terms of flammability and washing fastness. The thermal and fire behavior of the treated fabrics was thoroughly investigated. The results clearly showed that the VPA/MAA coating was able to exert a protective action, giving rise to the formation of a stable char on the surface of textile fibers upon heating, hence improving the flame retardant performance of cotton. Horizontal flame spread tests confirmed that the coated fabrics achieved self-extinction, and the residues well preserved the original weave structure and fiber morphology; at variance, the <b>uncoated</b> <b>fabric</b> left only ashes. A remarkable weight loss was observed only after the first washing cycle, then the samples did not show any significant weight loss, hence confirming the durability of the self-extinguishing treatment, even after five laundering cycles...|$|E

Existing methods of thermal conductivity improvement of textiles require extrusion facilities and the end products are heavy due to insertion of metal wires.

Then the coated fabric was allowed to react with an aqueous solution of reducing agents. The test {{results showed that the}} most suitable method to obtain a significant improvement in thermal conductivity of textiles is to follow an exhaustion dyeing method with reducing agents. The reduction process should be maintained at 700 C for 30 min duration with the addition of Sodium Hydrosulphide. Exhaust dyed fabric which was treated with reducing agents showed an improvement of 55 % in thermal conductivity compared to the <b>uncoated</b> <b>fabric,</b> which is a significant improvement in the thermal conductivity of textiles.

Short beam shear tests were performed to assess the effect of coating on the adhesion of the fiber to the matrix. The coated specimens exhibited worse interlaminar shear strength over that of <b>uncoated</b> <b>fabrics.</b> Three-point bending tests were also performed to investigate the effect of the coating on flexural properties. Whereas flexural strength and Young's modulus decreased with increasing amount of coating, the toughness, represented by the area under the stress-strain curve, presented a maximum.

Kevlar(TM) fabrics were coated with polyamide 6, 6 by in situ interfacial polymerization coating and solution dip-coating. Short beam shear tests were performed {{in order to assess}} the effect of coating on the adhesion of the fiber to the matrix. Both interfacial and solution coated specimens exhibited worse interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) over <b>uncoated</b> <b>fabrics.</b> Furthermore, double cantilever beam tests were also performed to investigate the effect of the coating on the Mode I fracture toughness. initiation fracture toughness increases for the solution coated fabrics whereas interfacial coating induced deterioration in performance. Finally, water absorption tests were carried out. Weight gain data versus time of immersion were collected at different temperatures and the water uptake at equilibrium (M-infinity) and the diffusion coefficient (D) were calculated. It seems that there: is a direct relationship between the ILSS and the diffusion results. The polyamide coating facilitates debonding of the fibers from the matrix and delamination, allowing more water uptake. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The bending {{performance}} of fabric air beams varies significantly from conventional beams. Both are {{dependent upon the}} constitutive relations of the material, but air beams are further dependent upon the thermodynamics of the internal air. As the governing energy balance demonstrates, air beam bending is dependent upon strain energy and PV-work (air compressibility). The relative importance of these terms will vary with pressure, volume changes and shear deformations. To this point, a swatch of <b>uncoated</b> plain-woven <b>fabric</b> was subjected to mechanical tests and its material properties determined. Attempts at using the stress-strain measurements in air beam models, assumed constructed with the same fabric, were made. The models accounted for fluid-structure interactions between the air and fabric.

Bending behavior was numerically investigated for several constitutive cases. The models were solved with the ABAQUS-Explicit program over a range of pressures.

To investigate the properties of the fabric heating element according to the pattern condition, patterns consisting of 3, 5, and 7 horizontal lines, i.e., P 3, P 5 and P 7, were respectively used; and subsequently, vertical lines were added to the horizontal lines, i.e., 2 P 3, 2 P 5 and 2 P 7, respectively. P 0 was used as the referencesample. P 0 showed a surface resistance of 1.2  ×  103  Ω/sq at a current of 0.85  A and an electric heating temperature of 76.9  °C. P 3 and 2 P 3 showed better electrical and electric heating properties than other samples, showing surface resistance values of 1.0  ×  103 and 1.2  ×  103  Ω/sq at the current values of 0.20 and 0.25  A, and surface temperatures of 71.8 and 75.7  °C, respectively. Although the currents applied to P 3 and 2 P 3 were lower than that applied to P 0, the electrical heating properties were modified to be similar. In terms of mechanical properties and water repellency, it was shown that the coated fabrics had higher values compared to the <b>uncoated</b> <b>fabric.</b> It was thus suggested that a small amount of CNF/PVDF-HFP composite can be used to manufacture an electric heating element with excellent performance.|$|E
40|$|The X-ray in {{the field}} of medical imaging is an {{important}} diagnostic tool, but it has been identified that there are potential radiation risks associated with the X-ray radiation scans. These risks have traditionally been guarded against using lead based shields. Lead has excellent radiation shielding properties, but it is also heavy and a potential health and environmental hazard due to its toxicity. Thus, there have been studies seeking to find an alternative that is as effective and yet counters the other drawbacks. In this paper, preliminary studies were conducted to assess the shielding effect of barium sulphate (BaSO 4) and bismuth oxide (Bi 2 O 3) on the coated fabric samples. X-ray transmission resulting from standard lead coated samples, <b>uncoated</b> <b>fabric,</b> BaSO 4, and BaSO 4 /Bi 2 O 3 coated fabrics was evaluated via measuring the penetration of primary radiation. Different properties such as mass per unit area, material thickness, and surface morphology were examined. All samples were irradiated by X-ray at 80 kVp to measure the amount of transmissions. The X-ray transmission level associated with BaSO 4 ranged from 84. 5 % to 70. 5 %. However, this level was elevated to 55. 6 % when BaSO 4 /Bi 2 O 3 mixture was applied on the fabric. The theoretical attenuation coefficient values associated with different coating mixtures comprising different weight proportions of BaSO 4, Bi 2 O 3, and PVC were determined between 0 MeV and 105 MeV using XCOM code. The XCOM results implied that the X-ray attenuation coefficient among all prepared coatings should be the mixture comprising 13. 3 wt% Bi 2 O 3 / 20 wt% BaSO 4 / 66. 7 wt% PVC, which was in agreement with the experimental results obtained from X-ray transmission measurements...|$|E
40|$|The passive sizing system {{consists}} {{of a series of}} low-profile pulleys attached to the front and back of the shoulder bearings on a spacesuit soft upper torso (SUT), textile cord or stainless steel cable, and a modified commercial ratchet mechanism. The cord/cable is routed through the pulleys and attached to the ratchet mechanism mounted {{on the front of the}} spacesuit within reach of the suited subject. Upon actuating the ratchet mechanism, the shoulder bearing breadth is changed, providing variable upper torso sizing. The active system {{consists of}} a series of pressurizable nastic cells embedded into the fabric layers of a spacesuit SUT. These cells are integrated to the front and back of the SUT and are connected to an air source with a variable regulator. When inflated, the nastic cells provide a change in the overall shoulder bearing breadth of the spacesuit and thus, torso sizing. The research focused on the development of a high-performance sizing and actuation system. This technology has application as a suit-sizing mechanism to allow easier suit entry and more accurate suit fit with fewer torso sizes than the existing EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) suit system. This advanced SUT will support NASA s Advanced EMU Evolutionary Concept of a two-sizes-fit-all upper torso for replacement of the current EMU hard upper torso (HUT). Both the passive and nastic sizing system approaches provide astronauts with real-time upper torso sizing, which translates into a more comfortable suit, providing enhanced fit resulting in improved crewmember performance during extravehicular activity. These systems will also benefit NASA by reducing flight logistics as well as overall suit system cost. The nastic sizing system approach provides additional structural redundancy over existing SUT designs by embedding additional coated fabric and <b>uncoated</b> <b>fabric</b> layers. Two sizing systems were selected to build into a prototype SUT: one active and one passive. From manned testing, it was found that both systems offer good solutions to sizing a SUT to fit a crewmember. This new system provided improved suit don/doff over existing spacesuit designs as well as providing better fit at suit operational pressure resulting in improved comfort and mobility.

The SMPUs were tailor made {{in order to obtain}} the phase transition temperature (soft segment crystal melting temperature) in the room temperature range. SEM studies were carried out in order to investigate the surface structure of coated and <b>uncoated</b> <b>fabrics.</b> The temperature sensitive water vapor permeability at soft segment crystal melting point was observed for SMPU coated fabrics. When the experimental temperature reached the soft segment crystal temperature of SMPU, an abrupt change of water vapor permeability of SMPU coated fabrics were observed. The significant change of water vapor permeability of SMPU coated fabrics is due to the phase change of SMPU which causes density changes inside the membranes due to micro-Brownian motion of soft segment, therefore, enhanced the water vapor permeability through the coated fabrics. The water vapor permeability of coated fabrics was also dependent on the primary structure of SMPU. When polycaprolactone glycol (PCL, Mn 3000 g mol- 1) was introduced in the polytetramethylene glycol (PTMG, Mn 2900 g mol- 1) based SMPU, the water vapor permeability decreases due to the increased interaction between the polymer chains due to presence of ester groups.

30|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop fabric heating {{elements}} using CNF/PVDF-HFP composite coated cotton fabric with various circuit patterns with the aim of providing low cost, flexible, light, and uniform heating performance compared to conventional fabric heating elements. We prepared a carbon nanocomposite with electrical properties and it was coated cotton fabric with two types of circuit patterns. The sample code of P 0 designates a reference sample, while P 3, P 5 and P 7 were used when the number of horizontal lines was 3, 5, and 7, respectively; patterns in which a vertical line was added to the horizontal lines were named 2 P 3, 2 P 5, and 2 P 7, respectively. The surface resistivity values ranged from 1.01  ×  103 to 1.65  ×  103  Ω/sq, and it was thus confirmed that the samples with various circuit patterns exhibit excellent electrical characteristics. The resistances of P 3 and 2 P 3 were lower than those of fabric heaters with 5 and 7 lines, and it is thus presented that the effect of the resistance is less affected by the decrease in the number of lines. Comparing patterns, P 7, P 5 and P 3 showed slightly lower resistances than 2 P 7, 2 P 5 and 2 P 3, indicating that the line in the vertical direction slightly increased the resistance. For electrical heating temperature, P 7, P 5 and P 3 showed more uniform heating performance than P 0 and the circuit with the added vertical line had a higher surface temperature than P 7, P 5, and P 3 in terms of joule heating. 2 P 3 had the best heating performance, and the surface temperature was similar to P 0 at about 76  °C. In terms of mechanical properties and water repellency, it was confirmed that the coated fabrics had higher values compared to the <b>uncoated</b> <b>fabric.</b> Therefore, we confirmed that the electrical heating performance of the fabric heating element coated with carbon nanocomposite in three lines is improved compared to that of the plane fabric heating element, and it is also confirmed that it is more economical, flexible and lightweight than the conventional products because of its use of a smaller amount of carbon nanocomposite. Thus, it is suitable for use as a functional material for electric heating. Fabric heating elements that employ a CNF/PVDF-HFP composite with various circuit patterns have potential applicability in extreme work environments, for active winter sports, cold military training, and wet suits that must maintain body temperature in water.|$|E
40|$|X-rays are {{a useful}} {{diagnostic}} {{tool in the}} radiology world. Despite their usefulness, overexposure to radiation affects the health {{of those who are}} working closely with X-ray scanning equipment. Overexposure to high levels of radiation can cause large number of cells in the human body to die or to lose their ability to replicate. This damage can ultimately lead to organ failure. Currently lead aprons are the only primary protective garment used by radiation workers in hospitals and clinics to shield them from radiation. However, the commercial lead aprons currently available in the healthcare market have many problems; for example, causing user back pain due to the weight of the apron. These inflexible aprons can crack, compromising the user’s protection from radiation leakage, and the disposal of these aprons can pollute the environment due to the toxicity of lead. Also, commercial aprons at present are only available as a universal design for both males and females, and therefore are not designed to fit the female anatomical structure. This research aimed at developing a durable, safer and lighter textile substrate and garment structure that improves shielding and structural integrity. In this thesis, the comfort properties of lead aprons have been evaluated to establish a baseline for future assessment of new designs. The thermal resistance of commercial lead aprons is shown to be high, potentially affecting the heat stress of the wearer. A new method was developed to measure the pressure distribution of lead aprons as part of understanding the comfort performance of protective clothing. A range of textile fabrics that could be used as alternative casing for lead aprons were investigated with a view to enhancing the comfort properties of existing commercial products. Prototype aprons were developed to accommodate the different body shape of female radiographers with enhanced comfort properties. The prototype aprons will be used as a backing base for coating with non-lead-based X-ray absorbing substances that have the same shielding efficiency as the lead standard, but are safer for the environment and lighter in weight. Experimental results of fabric coating showed that microparticles of size less than 10 μm and resin can be homogeneously spread on the coating side of the fabric surface. When the coating is {{on one side of the}} garment and primarily on the surface of the fabric, the <b>uncoated</b> <b>fabric</b> side can be exposed as the surface of an apron. This may save half the weight of casing material for an apron. Different methodologies and woven and knitted textile substrates were used to develop coated materials with novel X-ray attenuating substances. This thesis found that the X-ray attenuating substance atomic number, density, mass attenuation coefficient, linear attenuation coefficient, atomic cross-section and other important factors can affect the attenuation strength and should be considered when designing X-ray shielding garments. As a result, the selection of radiation-absorber substances must be made carefully to combine all these properties. Bismuth oxide was one of the best selections and achieved the best result for shielding from X-rays. Novel prototype aprons were developed based on evaluation of the benchmark lead aprons in terms of comfort performance. The selected textile materials have reasonable flexibility and good overall moisture management properties through use of a wool yarn plated with nylon. Different designs were created to suit the needs of various female bodies, such as radiographers, pregnant women and female patients who are undergoing mammography. All the prototype aprons have been assessed for comfort properties such as fit and air gap size, thermal comfort, stiffness and durability.

40|$|Abstract- The present {{research}} aims to vary the additional value on natural textiles by adding new properties with metal nano-scale coatings and evaluate magnetron sputtering coating technology suitability for natural textile coating. The paper describes {{the process of}} magnetron sputtering of copper coatings on six types of cotton textile materials. The analysis of the metal coated textile surface {{was carried out by}} scanning electron microscope and using a non-contact optical method. The method was based on the measurement of the difference of <b>uncoated</b> and coated <b>fabric</b> surface reflection mechanisms that allow getting a detailed insight in the textile surface changes after metal coating and during its exploitation. The research results demonstrate, that non-contact optical method can be applied to trace the changes of the textile surface relief, texture, trim after metal coating, as well to trace changes in coating evenness and deposited copper amount after exploitation process without the destruction of samples...|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{materials}} were used to fabricate nanocoatings using layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly to reduce the flammability of cotton fabric. The most effective brominated flame retardants have raised concerns related to their toxicity and environmental impact, which has created a need for alternative flame retardant chemistries and approaches. Polymer nanocomposites typically exhibit reduced mass loss and heat release rates, along with anti-dripping behavior, {{all of which are}} believed to be due to the formation of a barrier surface layer. Despite these benefits, the viscosity and modulus of the final polymeric material is often altered, making industrial processing difficult. These challenges inspired the use of LbL assembly to create densely layered nanocomposites in an effort to produce more flame-retardant coatings. Laponite and montmorillonite (MMT) clay were paired with branched poly(ethylenimine) to create thin film assemblies that can be tailored by changing pH and concentration of aqueous deposition mixtures. Both films can be grown linearly as a function of layers deposited, and they contained at least 70 wt percent of clay. When applying these films to cotton fabric, the individual fibers are uniformly coated and the fabric has significant char left after burning. MMT-coated fabric exhibits reduced total heat release, suggesting a protective ceramic surface layer is created. Small molecule, POSS-based LbL thin films were also successfully deposited on cotton fabric. With less than 8 wt percent added to the total fabric weight, more than 12 wt percent char remained after microscale combustion calorimetry. Furthermore, afterglow time was reduced and the fabric weave structure and shape of the individual fibers were highly preserved following vertical flame testing. A silica-like sheath was formed after burning that protected the fibers. Finally, the first intumescent LbL assembly was deposited on cotton fabric. SEM images show significant bubble formation on fibers, coated with a 0. 5 wt percent PAAm/ 1 wt percent PSP coating after burning. In several instances, a direct flame on the fabric was extinguished. The peak HRR and THR of coated fabric has 30 percent and 65 percent reduction, respectively, compared to the <b>uncoated</b> control <b>fabric.</b> These anti-flammable nanocoatings provide a relatively environmentally-friendly alternative for protecting fabrics, such as cotton, and lay the groundwork for rendering many other complex substrates (e. g., foam) flame-retardant without altering their processing and desirable mechanical behavior...|$|R
