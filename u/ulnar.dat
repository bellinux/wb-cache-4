5|$|On March 9, 2010, it was {{reported}} that Nathan had a tear in his <b>ulnar</b> collateral ligament. On March 21, after attempting to pitch without having surgery, Nathan decided to undergo Tommy John surgery, missing the entire 2010 season.|$|E
5|$|During {{the events}} of , Raynor participates {{in the defense of}} Korhal from Amon's forces {{alongside}} Artanis. He is later given a psionic call by Kerrigan to aid her and Artanis in a joint Terran Dominion/Zerg Swarm/Protoss invasion of the Void, a realm accessed from the Xel'Naga homeworld of <b>Ulnar,</b> to permanently kill Amon. In the aftermath of the war, Raynor disappears from public view with Kerrigan.|$|E
5|$|Eligible for salary arbitration, Nova and the Yankees {{agreed on}} a $3.3million salary for the 2014 season.

He had a 2–2 record and a 8.47 ERA in four starts before the surgery.|$|E
5|$|Feldman {{underwent}} reconstructive elbow {{surgery for}} a torn <b>ulnar</b> collateral ligament in October 2003. In his four appearances in 2004 for the Arizona League Rangers in the Arizona League, he pitched seven scoreless innings. He began the 2005 {{season with the}} Single-A Bakersfield Blaze, but after nine scoreless innings in relief was quickly promoted to the Double-A Frisco RoughRiders.|$|E
5|$|Loup began 2012 {{with the}} Fisher Cats. In the 2012 season, the Toronto Blue Jays used 32 {{different}} pitchers due to frequent injuries, and Loup was among these. He was {{called up to}} replace Luis Pérez on July 14 after Pérez tore his <b>ulnar</b> collateral ligament. In his debut, Loup retired all six batters he faced.|$|E

5|$|After a {{standout}} season at Chipola, the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim drafted Corbin {{in the second}} round of the 2009 MLB Draft. The Angels traded Corbin to the Diamondbacks in 2010 as part of a package for Dan Haren. Corbin made his MLB debut with the Diamondbacks in 2012, and was named an All-Star in 2013. Corbin missed the 2014 season due to an injury to the <b>ulnar</b> collateral ligament in his pitching elbow. He knows rapper Alex Dulin.|$|E
5|$|During spring {{training}} in 2014, Diamondbacks manager Kirk Gibson decided that Corbin would start on Opening Day. However, Corbin felt arm tightness during a {{spring training}} start. An MRI revealed {{damage to his}} <b>ulnar</b> collateral ligament of the elbow. He underwent Tommy John surgery, and missed the entire 2014 season. The Diamondbacks placed Corbin on the 15-day disabled list on March 30, and transferred him to the 60-day disabled list on April 4, in order to open a roster spot for Roger Kieschnick, who they claimed off waivers.|$|E
5|$|On April 8, 2015, Nathan {{was placed}} on the 15-day {{disabled}} list due to a strained right elbow. During a rehab start with the Toledo Mud Hens on April 22, Nathan re-injured his elbow after throwing only 10 pitches. The same night, Nathan underwent MRIs, which tested positive revealing tears in his <b>ulnar</b> collateral ligament of the elbow and his pronator teres muscle, and would undergo Tommy John surgery, ending Nathan's 2015 season. Sources projected that this surgery could end Nathan's career, but he was not planning to retire yet.|$|E
5|$|On July 17 at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, deGrom {{pitched a}} {{complete}} game shutout against the Philadelphia Phillies, allowing only one hit and one walk while striking out seven opposing batters. His game score of 97 was tied for second-best in Mets {{history in a}} nine-inning game. DeGrom's final pitching appearance of the season came on September 1, when he faced the Miami Marlins. He underwent season-ending surgery on his <b>ulnar</b> nerve in late September in order to relieve discomfort in his elbow and numbness in his fingers which had plagued him during the 2016 season.|$|E
5|$|The <b>ulnar</b> styloid process (a {{projection}} on the ulna, one of {{the bones}} of the forearm, where it meets the wrist) is not as hooked as in other lorisids, according to Schwartz, which Groves suggests may indicate that the wrist is more mobile. Another alleged diagnostic feature is the presence of an entepicondylar foramen (an opening near the distal, or far, end of the bone) on the humerus (upper arm bone); however, Sarmiento found this feature in 4 out of 11 specimens, and on one side of a fifth, and Stump noted that the foramen occurred in specimens from across the potto's range.|$|E
5|$|Vorazun {{had accused}} Zeratul of treasion against the Nerazim {{for his role}} in the death of her mother. Despite Artanis' protests {{regarding}} Raszagal's corruption by Kerrigan, she stated she would always hold Zeratul in contempt. It wasn't until following Zeratul's prophecy's that lead to <b>Ulnar,</b> she admitted that he was closer to the truth than anyone and after finally realizing that Zeratul's dedication to the Xel'naga prophecy's gave the protoss hope, she vowed to honor him with Artanis.|$|E
5|$|After {{suffering}} {{an injury}} and being {{knocked out of}} Michigan's game with Nebraska (a 23–9 loss to the Cornhuskers) on October 27, Robinson returned to the lineup for the last home game of the 2012 season, a 42-17 victory over Iowa. Playing in his final game at Michigan Stadium, Robinson split his playing time between the tailback, quarterback, and wide receiver positions. He accounted for 122 yards, including 98 rushing yards on 13 carries and 24 receiving yards on two receptions. With the injury to the <b>ulnar</b> nerve in his right elbow, Robinson did not throw the ball during the game {{and was forced to}} carry the ball in his right hand.|$|E
5|$|As the protoss {{celebrate}} their victory, however, Artanis and Jim Raynor are summoned by Kerrigan to <b>Ulnar,</b> the former Xel'Naga homeworld, which contains a gateway into the Void; Kerrigan seeks their help in going through and ending Amon {{once and for}} all. Fighting through Amon's minions, led by a reincarnated Duran/Narud, the trio release an imprisoned Xel'Naga named Ouros, who had appeared to both Zeratul and Artanis {{in the form of}} their deceased friend Tassadar to guide them towards his intended aim: For Kerrigan to ascend to become Xel'Naga herself, and use her powers to kill Amon, as only a Xel'Naga could defeat him for good. With the aid of Artanis and Raynor's armies, Kerrigan undergoes the ascension, and destroys Amon forever with a final blast of energy.|$|E

Fernández recorded nine strikeouts while walking none, and he joined Bob Gibson, Steve Carlton, Ferguson Jenkins, Walter Johnson, and Cy Young as the only pitchers to do so on Opening Day. On May 12, Fernández {{was placed on the}} 15-day disabled list due to a right elbow sprain. An MRI revealed that the elbow had a torn <b>ulnar</b> collateral ligament, which prematurely ended Fernández's 2014 season. He underwent Tommy John surgery on May 16. He made eight starts, going 4–2 with a 2.44 ERA and 70 strikeouts in 2014.|$|E
5|$|In Legacy of the Void, {{not long}} after his {{ascension}} to the throne, Korhal {{and the rest of}} the Dominion are assaulted by Moebius Foundation under control of the fallen Xel'Naga, Amon. Alongside Raynor, he does everything in his power to save his people. When Artanis arrives, he aids Raynor and Valerian to repel the Moebius Foundation on Korhal.

After Amon's defeat, Valerian has turned the Terran Dominion into a government of peace and prosperity.|$|E
5|$|The Mets {{selected}} Humber {{with the}} third overall selection in the 2004 MLB draft. During his minor league career, he underwent <b>ulnar</b> collateral ligament reconstruction, before making his MLB debut with the Mets. It took him several years to regain his ability to throw with the same velocity that he had prior to the injury. After being included in a trade to the Twins for Johan Santana, Humber struggled to establish himself. He spent a year with the Royals organization and was briefly {{a member of the}} Oakland Athletics organization, before being claimed on waivers by the White Sox in 2011, getting an opportunity to pitch in the White Sox' starting rotation. On April 21, 2012, Humber pitched the 21st perfect game in MLB history, defeating the Seattle Mariners.|$|E
5|$|The New York Mets {{selected}} deGrom in {{the ninth}} round as a pitcher, with the 272nd overall selection, of the 2010 MLB Draft. He signed with the Mets, receiving a $95,000 signing bonus. The Mets assigned deGrom to the Kingsport Mets of the Rookie-level Appalachian League, where he made six starts before {{he was diagnosed with}} a partial tear of the <b>ulnar</b> collateral ligament (UCL) in his pitching elbow. He attempted to rehabilitate his arm for four months, but underwent Tommy John surgery to repair the UCL in October. He did not pitch in 2011 while he recovered from the surgery. While rehabilitating, deGrom worked on his changeup with Johan Santana.|$|E
5|$|From 2004 to 2009, Nathan was {{considered}} one of the top closers in Major League Baseball (MLB) with four All-Star appearances and a league-leading 246 saves. In 2010, Nathan underwent Tommy John surgery to repair a torn <b>ulnar</b> collateral ligament in his throwing elbow and missed the entire season. On April 3, 2011, Nathan recorded his first save since his injury against the Toronto Blue Jays and later that year in July, Nathan regained the role as closer. On August 10, 2011, he became the Twins all-time leader in saves with his 255th in a game against the Boston Red Sox. After the 2011 season, Nathan left the Twins via free agency to sign with the Texas Rangers, becoming an All-Star again in 2012 and 2013. On April 8, 2013, he earned his 300th save. After the 2013 season, Nathan left the Rangers via free agency to sign with the Detroit Tigers. Nathan is currently eighth on the all-time saves list.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1987–88 season Vanbiesbrouck {{was hit by}} a puck {{under his}} mask in practice, which caused a non-displaced {{fracture}} of his lower jaw and a broken tooth. Fortunately for him the injury did not require his jaw to be wired shut, {{and he was able to}} return to practice the next day. He showed no ill effects from the injury, playing in 56 games, winning 27. On June 13, 1988 Vanbiesbrouck suffered nerve damage to his left wrist after a glass coffee table he was sitting on collapsed and broken glass lacerated his <b>ulnar</b> nerve and three tendons. He was sitting on the table assembling video equipment in anticipation of the birth of his first child. The glass broke beneath him, and as he braced for the fall, his wrist was cut by the glass. Vanbiesbrouck required five hours of microsurgery to remove glass from his wrist and repair the nerve and tendon damage. He was initially expected to miss 4–6 months, but he recovered in time to attend the Rangers pre-season training camp just 3 months later. Again he played in 56 games, and increased his win total to 28.|$|E

25|$|The {{adductor}} pollicis {{also has}} two heads. The transversal head originates {{along the entire}} third metacarpal bone, while the oblique head originates on the carpal bones proximal to the third metacarpal. The muscle is inserted onto the <b>ulnar</b> sesamoid bone of the metacarpophalangeal joint. It adducts the thumb, and assists in opposition and flexion. It is innervated by the deep branch of the <b>ulnar</b> nerve (C8-T1).|$|E
25|$|On July 5, {{activated}} RHP Javy Guerra {{from the}} 15-day disabled list, and placed SS Dee Gordon on the 15-day disabled list (torn <b>ulnar</b> collateral ligament in right thumb).|$|E
25|$|On April 27, placed RHP Brandon McCarthy on the 15-day {{disabled}} list with a torn <b>ulnar</b> collateral ligament {{in his right}} elbow and recalled LHP Adam Liberatore from AAA Oklahoma City.|$|E
25|$|In this novel, renegade Purple pretenders ally {{themselves}} with the Medusae {{as a means to}} regain their empire. But the Medusae, who are totally unlike humans in all ways, turn on the Purples, seeking to destroy all humans and move to the Solar System, as their own world, far older than Earth, is finally spiraling back into Barnard's Star. One of the Purples, John <b>Ulnar,</b> supports the Legion from the start, and he is the fourth great warrior. His enemy is the Purple pretender Eric <b>Ulnar,</b> who sought the Medusae out in the first place, seeking to become the next Emperor of The Sun.|$|E
25|$|In the Henry {{system of}} classification, {{there are three}} basic {{fingerprint}} patterns: loop, whorl, and arch, which constitute 60–65%, 30–35%, and 5% of all fingerprints respectively. There are also more complex classification systems that break down patterns even further, into plain arches or tented arches, and into loops that may be radial or <b>ulnar,</b> depending {{on the side of}} the hand toward which the tail points. <b>Ulnar</b> loops start on the pinky-side of the finger, the side closer to the ulna, the lower arm bone. Radial loops start on the thumb-side of the finger, the side closer to the radius. Whorls may also have sub-group classifications including plain whorls, accidental whorls, double loop whorls, peacock's eye, composite, and central pocket loop whorls.|$|E
25|$|Both heads join on {{the middle}} of the humerus, to form a single muscle mass usually near the {{insertion}} of the deltoid, to form a common muscle belly. Distally, biceps ends in two tendons: the stronger attaches to the radial tuberosity on the radius, while the other, the bicipital aponeurosis, radiates into the <b>ulnar</b> part of the antebrachial fascia.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, in the forearm, for clarity, {{the sides}} are {{named after the}} bones. Structures closer to the radius are radial, {{structures}} closer to the ulna are <b>ulnar,</b> and structures relating to both bones {{are referred to as}} radioulnar. Similarly, in the lower leg, structures near the tibia (shinbone) are tibial and structures near the fibula are fibular (or peroneal).|$|E
25|$|On May 29, Hill {{injured his}} left {{throwing}} elbow and on June 9, he underwent Tommy John {{surgery to repair}} a torn <b>Ulnar</b> collateral ligament. In nine games with the Red Sox in 2011, Hill pitched eight innings, striking out 12, walking three and giving up no earned runs. On December 12, Hill was non-tendered, and became a free agent.|$|E
25|$|As {{compared}} with apes, which have an elongated Pisiform, humans have a shorter pisiform bone. This {{is due to}} the loss of the single growth plate typically found in other mammalian pisiforms. This may be because of evolutionary benefits from having a shorter pisiform bone, including facilitating <b>ulnar</b> deviation of the hand, and preventing hyperextension of the wrist, actions that improve the action of clubbing.|$|E
25|$|Compared to the interscalene block, the supraclavicular block — despite {{eliciting}} a {{more complete}} block of the median, radial <b>ulnar</b> and musculocutaneous nerves — does not improve postoperative analgesia. However, the supraclavicular block is often quicker to perform and may result in fewer side effects than the interscalene block. Compared to the infraclavicular block and axillary blocks, the successful achievement of adequate anesthesia for surgery of the upper extremity {{is about the same}} with supraclavicular block.|$|E
