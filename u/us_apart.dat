500|$|After {{learning}} Jenna's {{scheme to}} con Carvel, Kenneth {{says that it}} is wrong and illegal, and says that if Cookie Puss knew about this [...] "he'd tear <b>us</b> <b>apart</b> with his fangs." [...] This is a reference to Cookie Puss, an ice cream cake character created by Carvel in the 1970s. A television commentator opined that the Carvel storyline here referenced the 1973 caper film The Sting that starred Paul Newman and Robert Redford, as two professional grifters, who decide to con a mob boss, played by Robert Shaw. In addition, after ordering the cakes with mistakes on them at a Carvel location, Grammer touches his nose as a sign to Jenna and Kenneth, who are outside, that he has ordered them, a similar gesture that Newman did in the film.|$|E
500|$|Animaniacs {{utilized}} a heavy {{musical score}} for an animated program, with every episode featuring {{at least one}} original score. The idea for an original musical score in every episode came from Steven Spielberg. Animaniacs used a 35-piece orchestra, and seven composers were contracted to write original underscore for the series run: Richard Stone, , , Carl Johnson, J. Eric Schmidt, Gordon Goodwin, and Tim Kelly. The use of the large orchestra in modern Warner Bros. animation began with Animaniacs predecessor, Tiny Toon Adventures, but Spielberg pushed for its use even more in Animaniacs. Although the outcome was a very expensive show to produce, [...] "the sound sets <b>us</b> <b>apart</b> from everyone else in animation," [...] said Jean MacCurdy, the executive in charge of production for the series. According to Steve and Julie Bernstein, {{not only was the}} Animaniacs music written in the same style as that of Looney Tunes composer Carl Stalling, but that the music was recorded at the Eastwood Scoring Stage, which was used by Stalling as well as its piano. Senior producer Tom Ruegger said that writers Randy Rogel, Nicholas Hollander, and Deanna Oliver wrote [...] "a lot of music" [...] for the series.|$|E

2500|$|Before February 1954, no {{endeavor}} {{to get the}} pledge officially amended had succeeded. The final successful push came from George MacPherson Docherty. Some American presidents honored Lincoln's birthday by attending services at the church Lincoln attended, New York Avenue Presbyterian Church by sitting in Lincoln's pew on the Sunday nearest February 12. On February 7, 1954, with President Eisenhower sitting in Lincoln's pew, the church's pastor, George MacPherson Docherty, delivered a sermon based on the Gettysburg Address entitled [...] "A New Birth of Freedom." [...] He argued that the nation's might lay not in arms but rather in its spirit and higher purpose. He noted that the Pledge's sentiments could be those of any nation: [...] "There was something missing in the pledge, and that which was missing was the characteristic and definitive factor in the American way of life." [...] He cited Lincoln's words [...] "under God" [...] as defining words that set the <b>US</b> <b>apart</b> from other nations.|$|E

Mudvayne's probably bigger now than it ever was. So, people want what they can't have." ...|$|E
