5|$|Land <b>use</b> <b>is</b> mixed. The land to {{the extreme}} north {{adjacent}} to the river is mostly industrial, split by the Felling By-Pass. The land south of the By-Pass towards the town centre is predominantly residential and includes the Nest, Brandling, Stoneygate and the Old Fold estates. Centrally the land is mixed between residential properties and the largely commercial use at Crowhall Lane and Victoria Square. At High Felling, land <b>use</b> <b>is</b> predominantly residential but there is around 25% green-space, including a park, cricket ground and urban open space to the south at Albion Street.|$|E

Compulsory licenses were abolished altogether.|$|R

5|$|Although a 2007 study {{estimated}} that introducing DST to Japan would reduce household lighting energy consumption, a 2007 simulation {{estimated that}} DST would increase overall energy use in Osaka residences by 0.13%, with a 0.02% decrease due to less lighting more than outweighed by a 0.15% increase due to extra cooling; neither study examined non-residential energy use. This is probably because DST's effect on lighting energy <b>use</b> <b>is</b> mainly noticeable in residences.|$|E

5|$|Although {{individuals}} with Asperger syndrome acquire language skills without significant general delay and their speech typically lacks significant abnormalities, language acquisition and <b>use</b> <b>is</b> often atypical. Abnormalities include verbosity, abrupt transitions, literal interpretations and miscomprehension of nuance, use of metaphor meaningful {{only to the}} speaker, auditory perception deficits, unusually pedantic, formal or idiosyncratic speech, and oddities in loudness, pitch, intonation, prosody, and rhythm. Echolalia has also been observed in {{individuals with}} AS.|$|E
5|$|Amino acids {{are used}} {{for a variety of}} {{applications}} in industry, but their main <b>use</b> <b>is</b> as additives to animal feed. This is necessary, since many of the bulk components of these feeds, such as soybeans, either have low levels or lack some of the essential amino acids: lysine, methionine, threonine, and tryptophan are most important in the production of these feeds. In this industry, amino acids are also used to chelate metal cations in order to improve the absorption of minerals from supplements, which may be required to improve the health or production of these animals.|$|E
5|$|Another {{well-known}} artefact with {{an astronomical}} <b>use</b> <b>is</b> the Antikythera mechanism. In this case {{analysis of the}} artefact, and reference to the description of similar devices described by Cicero, would indicate a plausible use for the device. The argument is bolstered {{by the presence of}} symbols on the mechanism, allowing the disc to be read.|$|E

5|$|Antioxidants are {{frequently}} added to industrial products. A common <b>use</b> <b>is</b> as stabilizers in fuels and lubricants to prevent oxidation, and in gasolines {{to prevent the}} polymerization {{that leads to the}} formation of engine-fouling residues. In 2014, the worldwide market for natural and synthetic antioxidants was US $2.25 billion with a forecast of growth to $3.25 billion by 2020.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six movements. A chorale movement, {{which ends}} {{most of his}} cantatas originally conceived for church <b>use,</b> <b>is</b> here penultimate movement, followed by the only chorus. The first movements are for the soloists: recitatives, a duet and an aria. In the following table of the movements, the scoring follows the Neue Bach-Ausgabe. The keys and time signatures are taken from the book by Bach scholar Alfred Dürr, using the symbols for common time (4/4) and alla breve (2/2). The instruments are shown according to type (winds and strings), while the continuo, playing throughout, is not shown.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} test the {{scalability}} of this procedure using the solar reflector as the sole heat source, the reaction was performed at various scales. The first scale of the reaction that <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>was</b> a milimolar scale that could <b>be</b> <b>used</b> for educational purposes. The second reaction <b>used</b> <b>was</b> scaled up to be ten times {{the volume of the}} first scale.

5|$|Cadmium {{occurs as}} a minor {{component}} in most zinc ores and is a byproduct of zinc production. Cadmium was used {{for a long time}} as a corrosion-resistant plating on steel, and cadmium compounds are used as red, orange and yellow pigments, to colour glass, and to stabilize plastic. Cadmium <b>use</b> <b>is</b> generally decreasing because it is toxic (it is specifically listed in the European Restriction of Hazardous Substances) and nickel-cadmium batteries have been replaced with nickel-metal hydride and lithium-ion batteries. One of its few new uses is cadmium telluride solar panels.|$|E
5|$|Fertility {{control is}} a {{non-lethal}} method of population management that is usually viewed as the most humane treatment, and its <b>use</b> <b>is</b> supported by the RSPCA. While it appears as though these treatments are effective in the breeding season immediately following injection, the lasting effects are debated. Because it is costly and difficult to treat animals repeatedly, this method, despite being ideal, is not widely implemented.|$|E
5|$|Five {{medications}} {{are currently}} {{used to treat}} the cognitive problems of AD: four are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (tacrine, rivastigmine, galantamine and donepezil) and the other (memantine) is an NMDA receptor antagonist. The benefit from their <b>use</b> <b>is</b> small. No medication has been clearly shown to delay or halt the progression of the disease.|$|E

40|$|A direct {{observation}} survey of safety belt <b>use</b> in Michigan <b>was</b> {{conducted in the}} fall of 2005. In this study, 13, 677 occupants traveling in four vehicle types (passenger cars, sport-utility vehicles, vans/minivans, and pickup trucks) were surveyed between September 1 and 16, 2005. Belt <b>use</b> <b>was</b> estimated for all commercial/noncommercial vehicle types combined (the statewide safety belt use rate) and separately for each vehicle type. The current survey was designed to provide data for comparison with surveys conducted in previous years. Within and across each vehicle type, belt use by age, sex, road type, day of week, time of day, and seating position were calculated. Statewide belt <b>use</b> <b>was</b> 87. 9 percent. Safety belt <b>use</b> <b>was</b> 90. 3 percent for passenger cars, 86. 8 percent for sport-utility vehicles, 88. 1 percent for vans/minivans, and 82. 2 percent for pickup trucks. For all vehicle types combined, belt <b>use</b> <b>was</b> higher for females than for males.
