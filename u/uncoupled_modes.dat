40|$|Nonlinear normal {{modes of}} a fixed-fixed buckled beam about its first post-buckling {{configuration}} are investigated. The cases of three-to-one and one-to-one internal resonances are analyzed. Approximate {{solutions for the}} nonlinear normal modes are computed by applying the method of multiple scales directly to the governing integral-partial-differential equation and associated boundary conditions. Curves displaying variation of the amplitude {{of one of the}} modes with the internal-resonance-detuning parameter are generated. It is shown that, for a three-to-one internal resonance between the first and third modes, the beam may possess one stable uncoupled mode (high-frequency mode) and either (a) one stable coupled mode, (b) three stable coupled modes, or (c) two stable and one unstable coupled modes. For the same resonance, the beam possesses one degenerate mode (with a multiplicity of two) and two stable and one unstable coupled modes. On the other hand, for a one-to-one internal resonance {{between the first and second}} modes, the beam possesses (a) two stable <b>uncoupled</b> <b>modes</b> and two stable and two unstable coupled modes; (b) one stable and one unstable <b>uncoupled</b> <b>modes</b> and two stable and two unstable coupled modes; and (c) two stable uncoupled and two unstable coupled modes (with a multiplicity of two).

The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine the role of the soil states in medium-range weather predictability. A limited area weather prediction model is used with the atmosphere/ land-surface system in coupled or <b>uncoupled</b> <b>mode.</b> It covers Europe and part of the north Atlantic, and is driven by prescribed sea-surface temperatures over the sea, and by atmospheric reanalyses at its lateral boundaries. A series of 3 member ensembles of summer simulations are used to assess the predictability of a reference simulation assumed to be perfect. In a first step, two ensembles are simulated: the first with the atmosphere coupled to the land-surface model, the second in the <b>uncoupled</b> <b>mode</b> with perfect soil conditions prescribed every 6 hours. Subsequent experiments are combinations thereof, in which the <b>uncoupled</b> and coupled <b>modes</b> alternate in the course of a simulation. The results show that there are "stable" and "unstable" periods in the weather evolution under consideration. During the stable periods, the predictability (measured in terms of ensemble spread at 500 hPa) of the coupled and uncoupled dynamical systems is almost identical; prescribing the perfect soil conditions has a negligible impact upon the atmospheric predictability. In contrast, the predictability during an unstable phase is found to be remarkably improved in the uncoupled ensembles. This effect results from guiding the atmospheric phase-space trajectory along its perfect evolution. It persists even when switching back from the uncoupled to the coupled mode prior to the onset of the unstable phase, a result that underlines the importance of soil moisture and temperature in data assimilation systems...|$|R

To this end, the influence of surface tension on the modal frequencies is investigated by assuming pure slipping at the contact line and a 90 deg contact angle between the fluid surface and the walls.
