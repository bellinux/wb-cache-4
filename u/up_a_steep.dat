5|$|At {{the base}} of the first drop, the train banks a few degrees to the right and climbs the first air-time hill and descends. Following this, the train climbs up to a hairpin 180-degree hammerhead turn to the left. The train descends from the height of the turn to travel up and over three more air-time hills. After the hills, the train climbs <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> slope into the mid-course brake run.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese had {{developed}} the position considerably, establishing a complex defensive network and, whereas {{up until that}} point they had usually withdrawn {{in the face of}} the advancing Australians, they decided to make a stand. Employing a 75mm gun, which was fired over open sights due to the closeness of the fighting, along with some 37mm guns and a number of machine guns of varying calibre, they fought fiercely. Halted by fire, the Australians called in fire support to overwhelm the Japanese with fire superiority, and resorting to employing the indirect method that would characterise their operations during this phase of the advance, and which was necessitated by the depleted state of their forces. Moving <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> slope that was covered by kunai grass, one of the tanks broke down, nevertheless the Australian armour was able to deliver a significant bombardment which enabled the infantry to take the position early in the evening.|$|E
5|$|Late that afternoon, {{after about}} a week of dry weather, it began to rain. As a result, the track became more {{difficult}} and mobility was reduced; the tanks found the track impassable {{and as a consequence}} the advancing Australian infantry lost their direct fire support. Resupply also proved to be a problem for them. The jeeps that had been bringing up supplies could not get forward and there were not enough native porters to meet the demand. As a result, the Australians had to resort to using one of their infantry battalions, the 2/24th, to bring supplies forward from Palanko while the 2/23rd continued the advance on Kuanko. Several isolated pockets of Japanese defenders were located along the track holding and so, while their sister battalion struggled up and down the steep track under the weight of their portage, on 1 December elements of the 2/23rd, leaving their heavy stores and equipment behind, advanced <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep,</b> muddy slope and set about clearing these positions. The Japanese resistance was overwhelmed and by midday the Australians entered Kuanko. Exploiting beyond the village in the afternoon, the lead Australian company took fire from a ridge line to the north-west and the advance was halted for the day.|$|E
50|$|There is {{no direct}} access for private cars, the nearest option is pay car park by the Hüttenteich pond in Geising. From there two well-signed hiking trails {{run to the}} summit, either along the road or <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>steeper,</b> but shorter option uphill from the Anton Günther Stein.|$|R

5000|$|It is a torn {{ligament}} {{caused by}} excessive hindquarter effort, {{or from a}} horse that had the hindquarters slip out underneath or trotted <b>up</b> <b>a</b> very <b>steep</b> hill. Usually does not cause problems once healed, although {{it is easier to}} re-injure.|$|R
25|$|Truckers {{also use}} their 4 ways {{flashing}} <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> hill, mountain roads and on ramps on express ways to let others {{know that they}} are traveling at a slow speed and to be cautious approaching them.|$|E
25|$|Fall Brook Trail - is a 1 mile {{difficult}} {{trail that}} is marked with red blazes. The trail begins across the creek from Wheaton House and follows Fall Brook <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> hill and passes three waterfalls. Fall Brook Trail ends at Bunny Trail.|$|E
25|$|The Torpoint ferry {{had been}} in {{operation}} since at least 1834, having been developed by J M Rendel. Moorsom appears not to have given much thought to the practicalities of using the crossing, which would have involved through trains being divided and each portion then being propelled down a very steep gradient onto the ferry boat; and each portion being hauled <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> gradient and re-formed on the other side.|$|E
50|$|Stellar flares are {{observed}} {{when there is}} an explosion on the surface of a star. This will cause the star's brightness to shoot <b>up</b> considerably, with <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> drop off.|$|R
50|$|Hạf'liua also {{features}} some graves on its top surface. While the process {{must have been}} extremely difficult for the relatives attempting to move the dead <b>up</b> such <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> cliff for burial, the very process was undertaken {{for the protection of}} the bodies, and the effort involved was considered indicative of the love or esteem held for the deceased.|$|R
60|$|A {{few minutes}} later Daisy and Mr. Dabster stepped from an {{elevator}} to {{the top floor of}} the skyscraper. Then <b>up</b> <b>a</b> short, <b>steep</b> stairway and out upon the roof. Dabster led her to the parapet so she could look down at the black dots moving in the street below.|$|R
25|$|The Hawaiian {{style of}} {{ranching}} originally included capturing wild cattle by driving them into pits dug {{in the forest}} floor. Once tamed somewhat by hunger and thirst, they were hauled out <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> ramp, and tied by their horns to the horns of a tame, older steer (or ox) that knew where the paddock with food and water was located. The industry grew slowly under the reign of Kamehameha's son Liholiho (Kamehameha II).|$|E
25|$|Two people {{challenged}} the older boys, but they claimed Bulger was {{a younger brother}} or that he was lost and they were taking him to the local police station. At one point, the boys took Bulger into a pet shop, from which they were ejected. Eventually the boys arrived {{in the village of}} Walton, and with Walton Lane police station across the road facing them, they hesitated and led Bulger <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> bank to a railway line near the disused Walton & Anfield railway station, close to Anfield Cemetery, where they began torturing him.|$|E
25|$|Similar to a funnel, a half-pipe {{features}} a slide in which riders oscillate back and forth. However, {{this style of}} ride does not feature any enclosed sections. On a Waterfun Product Sidewinder or Sidewinder Mini, riders oscillate several times before coming to a rest {{at the base of}} the slide. Riders then need to walk off the slide returning their tube to the next riders. On a WhiteWater West Boomerango or Family Boomerango, riders are sent down a steep drop and <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> hill on the other side, before sliding backwards down another path to the end of the slide.|$|E
50|$|When {{training}} a horse to gallop <b>up</b> or down <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> incline, he should first be taught on soft ground. Xenophon mentions {{that the reader}} should not fear that the horse will dislocate a shoulder when running downhill.|$|R
50|$|Transport {{from the}} base station {{up to the top}} is by 4 wheel drive Land Rovers <b>up</b> <b>a</b> very <b>steep</b> and narrow road. The ride up and down is {{exciting}} quite like a roller coaster trip. The fee as at June 2017 is Ringgit 10 one way up, with fixed timings for the upwards and downwards journeys.|$|R
5000|$|The St. Croix Half Ironman Triathlon {{is held in}} {{the first}} week of May. The Triathlon {{includes}} a 1.2 mi swim, a 56 mi bike ride, and a 13.1 mi run.

25|$|On 9 April 1945, Italy, {{when a small}} {{party were}} almost wiped out in {{an assault on the}} east floodbank of the river, Sepoy Namdeo Jadav carried two wounded men under heavy fire through deep water, <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> bank and through a mine belt to safety. Then, {{determined}} to avenge his dead comrades, he eliminated three enemy machine-gun posts. Finally, climbing on top of the bank he shouted the Maratha war cry and waved the remaining companies across. He not only saved many lives but enabled the battalion to secure the bridgehead and ultimately to crush all enemy resistance in the area.|$|E
25|$|In 1896, in {{the western}} portion of Fayette County, Col. Page formed a small logging railroad, Loup Creek and Deepwater Railway which {{extended}} from an interchange point at Deepwater, West Virginia with the C on the south bank of the navigable Kanawha River about four miles (6km) <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> grade into the mountainous terrain southward, following the winding Loup Creek to reach a sawmill at Robson. Col. Page, who had been involved with building the C and more recently in developing some of its coal branches, arranged for the larger railroad to operate his short line to the sawmill on the Loup Creek Estate under a verbal agreement which was to last until 1903.|$|E
25|$|In 1811, the Sant Ferran {{fortress}} {{was about}} 60 years old. The powerful citadel {{was designed and}} constructed in the reign of King Ferdinand VI of Spain and named San Fernando (Sant Ferran). In {{the form of a}} circular bastioned enceinte, the fortress stood on a hill overlooking Figueres and the highway from Barcelona to Perpignan, France. To reach the front gate, an attacker had to march <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> slope on a road with several switchbacks. Sant Ferran fortress capitulated to the French Republican army of General of Division Dominique Catherine de Pérignon on 28 November 1794. This event occurred eight days after the Spanish defeat in the Battle of the Black Mountain during the War of the Pyrenees.|$|E
60|$|Archie observed, with satisfaction, that Bruce {{was making}} <b>up</b> <b>an</b> {{extremely}} <b>steep</b> hillside, deeming probably that horsemen {{would be unable}} to follow him here, and that {{he would be able to}} distance pursuers on foot. Ten minutes later his pursuers had reached the foot of the hill. Pembroke at once ordered four knights and ten men-at-arms to dismount.|$|R
5000|$|Alto is a {{ghost town}} in Santa Cruz County, Arizona, first settled in early 1900s {{in what was then}} part of the Tyndall Mining District, east of Tubac in the Santa Rita Mountains. The town was {{originally}} named El Plomo, which is Spanish for [...] "lead", and was changed to Alto, meaning [...] "high", many years later, probably because the mines were located high <b>up</b> on <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> mountainside.|$|R
60|$|The night shut down, {{dark and}} drizzly and cold. About {{eight in the}} evening the fog lifted and showed us a well-worn path which led <b>up</b> <b>a</b> very <b>steep</b> rise to the left. We took it, {{and as soon as}} we had got far enough from the railway to render the finding it again an impossibility, the fog shut down on us once more.|$|R
25|$|Early the {{following}} year, the battalion was withdrawn back to Aitape by sea from Dogreto Bay, {{moving into a}} reserve position around Tadi plantation. Later, starting in late March they moved to But by landing craft, and from there joined the advance towards Wewak, which fell on 10 May. They subsequently pushed into the Prince Alexander Range in the interior, where the last significant Japanese forces were concentrated. In late June, the 19th Brigade advanced on the position from the north, while the 17th advanced from the west. On 10 June, the battalion began preliminary actions to secure the Japanese strong hold on Mount Shiburangu. The approaches were secured {{over the course of}} a week with artillery and flamethrowers being used to help overcome the Japanese bunkers, and on 27 June the battalion assaulted the summit. Over 3,000 rounds of artillery were fired to soften up the Japanese defences, but the Australians still came up against heavy resistance, as the Japanese defenders employed salvaged aircraft machine-guns. These were outflanked by a platoon that advanced <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> slope, attacking the Japanese left from behind and allowing the rest of 'C' Company to secure the summit. This was the battalion's final major action of the war, and cost it three killed and seven wounded. Between 44 and 70 Japanese were killed, with over 50 bunkers being destroyed.|$|E
25|$|In the 18th century, Brighton was a {{small town}} based on a declining fishing {{industry}} and still suffering the effects of damage caused by the Great Storm of 1703. Its population {{in the middle of}} the century was approximately 2,000. Its fortunes improved after a doctor from nearby Lewes, Richard Russell, wrote a treatise encouraging the use of seawater as a cure for illness, in particular glandular swellings. He recommended bathing in the sea and drinking the water at Brighton. This form of medical therapy became popular, and helped make the town a fashionable place to visit. Brighton became increasingly popular throughout the rest of the century, but received its next significant boost when the Prince Regent, son of King George III, made his first visit in 1783. By 1786 he had a home in the town—a rented farmhouse near the Old Steine, inland from the coast—and he later commissioned the architect John Nash to build a palace, the Royal Pavilion, for him on the site. The Prince was an infrequent churchgoer, and Brighton's only Anglican church, St Nicholas, was a long way from his home and <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> hill. Furthermore, the ever-increasing number of visitors and residents caused overcrowding in the church. In 1789 the new Vicar of Brighton, Revd Thomas Hudson, decided to resolve these problems by building a new chapel near the Prince's house. He hoped to encourage the Prince to attend, and thereby worship more often than he had in the past, and considered that a more central chapel would relieve the pressure on the parish church.|$|E
500|$|During the Crucible {{portion of}} Marine Corps Recruit Training on the West Coast, {{there is an}} {{obstacle}} named [...] "Basilone's Challenge" [...] that consists of carrying ammunition cans filled with concrete <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep,</b> wooded hill.|$|E
50|$|With {{the flying}} fox, the pulley(s), {{attached}} to the car, are fixed to the cable. The car itself can consist of anything from a simple hand grip, with the user hanging underneath, to a bucket for transporting small items, to a quite elaborate construction, perhaps including a seat or a safety strap. Children's versions are usually not set <b>up</b> with <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> incline, so the speeds are kept relatively low, negating {{the need for a}} means of stopping.|$|R
25|$|On 11–12 March 1944, Naik Nand Singh, {{commanding}} {{a leading}} {{section of the}} attack, was ordered to recapture a position gained by the enemy. He led his section <b>up</b> <b>a</b> very <b>steep</b> knife-edged ridge under very heavy machine-gun and rifle fire and although wounded in the thigh, captured the first trench. He then crawled forward alone and, wounded again {{in the face and}} shoulder, nevertheless captured the second and third trenches.|$|R
50|$|Bank Road is a road in Matlock, Derbyshire {{which runs}} from Crown Square <b>up</b> Matlock Bank, <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> hill {{which gives the}} road its name, to Wellington Street.

500|$|The name of {{the park}} derives from a road built by George Alexander Anstey, a South Australian {{pastoral}} and horticultural pioneer. Anstey established Highercombe Estate on two land sections east of the park that he purchased in 1840. [...] He built a private road to his estate, which ran along {{the base of a}} gully and <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> hillside. The road was initially named [...] "Anstey Hill Road"; this name was later used for the hill, the subsequent land reserve and the current recreation park.|$|E
25|$|Beyond Pine Plains, {{the forest}} returns {{to a more}} {{deciduous}} character as the trail remains level while becoming decidedly westward in heading, crossing many rivulets or streambeds, some offering picturesque mini-cascades of their own. Finally, at a junction 3.7miles (6km) from the trailhead, the Long Path drops down into Kaaterskill Clove while the snowmobile route heads <b>up</b> <b>a</b> slightly <b>steeper</b> slope. After several hundred feet (about a hundred meters), it reaches the loop.|$|R
50|$|The {{campground}} in {{the town}} had a home built railroad which runs around the pond, this has been removed due to liability reasons. The roadbed can still {{be seen as a}} rubber walkway, the rails since removed. The train can still be seen onsite sinking into sand, now used as a playground for children. This engine used rubber on its wheels to get <b>up</b> <b>a</b> very <b>steep</b> grade in the SE corner.|$|R
50|$|The cars {{maneuver}} {{a slight}} inclined turn, where they pass by the Knit-Witt, an original 1964 gag; {{a set of}} three wall-mounted busts; and a witch, who lunges toward the car. The car makes yet another rapid descent; this one leads through a graveyard-themed room. The cars pass {{through a number of}} hinged door-like graves, which are knocked aside as the vessel speeds downhill. Hanging above is a ghoul, while a demonic looking entity rises from behind a gravestone. The car finally begins an ascent upward. As the car climbs <b>up</b> the incline, <b>a</b> bat flies toward the car from overhead. After reaching the top of the incline and crashing through a set of doors, the car passes a coffin bathed in a bright red light. The car makes a sharp left turn and heads <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>steeper</b> incline. This one, which includes another crooked grade, is located inside another crooked hallway. Nearing the peak, one of the overhead beams cracks. The cars enter a set of doors and level out into darkness.|$|R
