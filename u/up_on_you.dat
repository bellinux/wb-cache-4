25|$|ABC {{cemented}} {{its reputation}} as a youth-oriented network in daytime {{with the addition of}} One Life to Live to its schedule, with {{much of the rest of}} its lineup consisting of soap operas like Dark Shadows, sitcom reruns, and game shows packaged by Chuck Barris. One Life to Live replaced the short-lived Baby Game, in a three-way shuffle with Dark Shadows and Dating Game. The network placed the new serial at 3:30 PM EST, against CBS's established hit Edge of Night and the popular NBC game You Don't Say. Despite the tough competition, the intense tone of the plot and strong characters allowed the show to get a leg <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>You</b> Don't Say, wearing that game down to the point of its cancellation in September 1969; NBC replaced the Tom Kennedy-hosted game in that time slot with three unsuccessful serials: Bright Promise, Return to Peyton Place, and How to Survive a Marriage.|$|E
500|$|Upon the album's release, {{critical}} {{response to}} [...] "Photograph" [...] was generally positive. In his track-by-track review of x for Billboard magazine, Jason Lipshutz {{suggested that the}} line [...] "Loving can hurt sometimes/But it's {{the only thing that}} I know" [...] in [...] "Photograph" [...] was the [...] "lynchpin line of the whole album". Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe had the same sentiment; she called the song [...] "haunting" [...] and felt it [...] " [...] <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>you</b> with [...] tunefulness". Jamieson Cox of Time described Sheeran's use of [...] "detail and powerful imagery" [...] in the lyrics as [...] "smart"; Cox opined that it [...] " [...] to life".|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé is a {{fourteen}} track {{set with}} seventeen short films: a video for each audio track, two extra videos {{to accompany the}} two-part tracks [...] "Haunted" [...] and [...] "Partition", {{as well as a}} bonus video for [...] "Grown Woman", which lacks an equivalent audio counterpart. Departing from the traditional R leanings of its predecessor, 4 (2011), Beyoncés songs are predominantly alternative R. Hence, musically, the album may be located in the post-dubstep era, fusing electronic music with R and soul. The album's dark, moody production is more textured than previous releases and songs are characterized by heavy bass and loud hi-hats, as well as prominent synthesizers. A quality of restraint features among most songs [...] "with subdued pulses, ambient effects and throbbing grooves that sneak <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>you,</b> threatening to explode but only occasionally transforming".|$|E

500|$|A. O. Scott of The New York Times called Ratatouille [...] "a nearly {{flawless}} {{piece of}} popular art, {{as well as}} one of the most persuasive portraits of an artist ever committed to film"; echoing the character Anton Ego in the film, he ended his review with a simple [...] "thank you" [...] to the creators of the film. Wally Hammond of Time Out gave the film five out of five stars, saying [...] "A test for tiny tots, a mite nostalgic and as male-dominated as a modern kitchen it may be, but these are mere quibbles about this delightful addition to the Pixar pantheon." [...] Andrea Gronvall of the Chicago Reader gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "Brad Bird's second collaboration with Pixar is more ambitious and meditative than his Oscar-winning The Incredibles." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B, saying [...] "Ratatouille has the Pixar technical magic without, somehow, the full Pixar flavor. It's Brad Bird's genial dessert, not so much incredible as merely sweetly edible." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "What makes Ratatouille such a hilarious and heartfelt wonder is the way Bird contrives to let it sneak <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>you.</b> And get a load of that score from Michael Giacchino, a perfect compliment to a delicious meal." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "For parents looking to spend time in a theater with their kids or adults who want something lighter and less testosterone-oriented than the usual summer fare, Ratatouille offers a savory main course." [...] Christy Lemire of the Associated Press gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "Ratatouille is free of the kind of gratuitous pop-culture references that plague so many movies of the genre; it tells a story, it's very much of our world but it never goes for the cheap, easy gag." [...] Justin Chang of Variety gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "The master chefs at Pixar have blended all the right ingredients – abundant verbal and visual wit, genius slapstick timing, a soupcon of Gallic sophistication – to produce a warm and irresistible concoction." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sondheim detested his mother, who {{was said}} to be psychologically abusive and {{projected}} her anger from her failed marriage on her son: [...] "When my father left her, she substituted me for him. And she used me the way she used him, to come on to and to berate, beat <b>up</b> <b>on,</b> <b>you</b> see. What she did for five years was treat me like dirt, but come on to me at the same time." [...] She once wrote him a letter saying that the [...] "only regret [...] ever had was giving him birth." [...] When his mother died in the spring of 1992, Sondheim did not attend her funeral.|$|E
2500|$|The New York Times {{film critic}} A. O. Scott praised the film's pacing, dialogue, and {{supporting}} performances, describing it as [...] "wry and insightful". Scott Foundas of Variety called it [...] "an initially breezy family comedy about mothers, daughters and abortions that slowly sneaks <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>you</b> and packs a major wallop", praising Weitz's dialogue and the [...] "devastating" [...] scene wherein Elle reunites with Karl. Writing for New York, David Edelstein declared that [...] "Grandma marks {{a new era}} in gay cinema" [...] and felt that the story was [...] "schematic but heartfelt". Brian Moylan of The Guardian gave the film three out of five stars and wrote, [...] "Possibly the greatest thing about Grandma is that it passes the Bechdel test with flying colours, better than any film I've seen recently." [...] Slant Magazines R. Kurt Osenlund, on the other hand, felt that the plot was contrived and unfulfilling, and described the film as having [...] "about as many ambitions as it does delusions".|$|E

2500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review, David Handelman from Rolling Stone said {{the songs are}} [...] "buoyed by the deft interplay of the three voices and a poetic tornado of imagery", featuring [...] "equally far-flung" [...] musical samples on an album that is [...] "littered with bullshit tough-guy bravado, but it's clever and hilarious bullshit". Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune commended the Dust Brothers' [...] "deft" [...] production and the Beastie Boys' rhymes, which he called [...] "hilarious, vicious, surreal, snotty." [...] Writing for Playboy, Robert Christgau said although it [...] "doesn't jump you the way great rap usually does," [...] "the Beasties and Tone-Loc's Dust Brothers have worked out a sound that sneaks <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>you</b> with its stark beats and literal-minded samples, sometimes in a disturbing way". He commended them for [...] "bearing down on the cleverest rhymes in the biz" [...] and wrote, [...] "the Beasties concentrate on tall tales rather than boasting or dissing. In their irresponsible, exemplary way they make fun of drug misuse, racism, assault, and other real vices fools might accuse them of." [...] In a retrospective review, he said the record's [...] "high-speed volubility and riffs from nowhere will amaze and delight you", calling it [...] "an absolutely unpretentious and unsententious affirmation of cultural diversity, of where [...] came from and where they went from there." ...|$|E
