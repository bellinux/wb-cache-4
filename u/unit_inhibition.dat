40|$|A spin-labelled {{analogue}} of glutathione (sl-glutathione) {{has been}} used in order to characterize the active site of human placenta glutathione transferasc pi. The sl-glutathione shows a competitive inhibition towards glutathione (K(i) = 14 -mu-M). Binding of sl-glutathione to the enzyme, followed by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, gives a K(d) of 3 -mu-M and two identical binding sites for dimeric <b>unit.</b> <b>Inhibition</b> of the enzyme, by modification of the Cys- 47 residue, completely prevents the binding of sl-glutathione. The same results are obtained by monitoring the binding of glutathione by means of fluorescence spectroscopy.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) is {{responsible}} of many oncologic and non-oncologic diseases, including hemophagocytic syndrome in which {{red blood cells}} are phagocytosed by macrophages and B cells. EBV is reported to infect mainly B lymphocytes and epithelial cells; virus can be detected also in rare monocytes/macrophages, but its efficient replication in these cells has not been demonstrated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: EBV was obtained from P 3 RH 1 cells stimulated with phorbol and butirate. A human monocytic cell line (THP- 1) and an EBV negative B cell line (BJA-B) were infected with P 3 HR 1 - EBV strain: virus growth was monitored by IFA with a monoclonal antibody and by Real-Time PCR TaqMan. The effects of virus replication on phagocytosis of Candida albicans were evaluated {{by means of a}} double stain immunofluorescence assay. Intracellular killing of phagocytosed candida cells was measured by the colony forming <b>unit</b> <b>inhibition</b> assay. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION EBV can productively infect THP- 1 monocyte cell line. EBV infection results in a significant increase in macrophage phagocytic activity versus Candida albicans as well as alteration of intracellular killing. Also BJA-B cells were stimulated in their phagocytic activity by EBV infectio...|$|E
40|$|To {{examine the}} {{relative}} roles of apical and basolateral membrane transport mechanisms {{in the regulation}} of cell pH in the proximal convoluted tubule, cell pH was measured in the in vivo micro-perfused rat tubule using fluorescence. Decreasing luminal pH by 0. 7 pH units caused cell pH to decrease by 0. 08 pH units, whereas a similar decrease in peritubular pH caused cell pH to decrease by 0. 32 pH <b>units.</b> <b>Inhibition</b> of basolateral membrane bicarbonate transport with peritubular 4 -acetamido- 4 '-isothio-cyanostilbene- 2, 2 '-disulfonate (SITS) enhanced the response to luminal fluid acidification. Removal of luminal sodium caused a small transient acidification which {{was followed by a}} late alka-linization. Peritubular SITS increased the magnitude of the transient acidification, and eliminated the late alkalinization. The acidification was partially inhibited by luminal amiloride. The results demonstrate sodium-coupled processes on both the apical (Na/H antiport) and basolateral (Na/HCO 3 symport) mem-branes. Basolateral membrane transporters are more important determinants of cell pH...|$|R
40|$|The {{functioning}} modalities of the efferent {{system were}} analysed in the isolated frog labyrinth. The efferent synapses of the posterior canal were activated via an axon reflex by antidromic electrical shocks (10 - 200 Hz) applied for increasing times (250 ms- 10 s) to the anterior-horizontal nerves. Either decrease (inhibition) or increase (facilitation) in the resting discharge rate {{were observed in}} the majority of the <b>units</b> examined. <b>Inhibition</b> and facilitation, h√≥wever, are peculiar to any given <b>unit</b> since <b>inhibition</b> does not reverse to facilitation or vice-versa. This fact as well as the long response latency (not less than 10 ms) and the linear dependence of both effects on the stimulation frequency suggest that inhibition and facilitation are due to the repetitive activation of two different types of efferent fibres synapsing on the hair cells. The drastic modifications in the afferent synaptic discharge produced by full activation of the efferent system indicate that the static properties (response asymmetry) as well as the dynamic properties (response adaptation) of the mechanically driven afferent response can be substantially controlled by the central nervous system at the receptor level...|$|R

In sharp contrast, it is unknown whether yeast has an inhibitory potential {{for the growth of}} pathogenic bacteria in food. A total of 404 yeasts were screened for inhibitory activity against five Listeria monocytogenes strains. Three hundred and four of these yeasts were isolated from smear-ripened cheeses. Most of the yeasts were identified by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Using an agar-membrane screening assay, a fraction of approximately 4 % of the 304 red smear cheese isolates clearly inhibited growth of L. monocytogenes. Furthermore, 14 out of these 304 cheese yeasts were cocultivated with L. monocytogenes WSLC 1364 on solid medium to test the antilisterial activity of yeast in direct cell contact with Listeria. All yeasts inhibited L. monocytogenes to a low degree, which is most probably due to competition for nutrients. However, one Candida intermedia strain was able to reduce the listerial cell count by 4 log units. Another four yeasts, assigned to C. intermedia (three strains) and Kluyveromyces marxianus (one strain), repressed growth of L. monocytogenes by 3 log <b>units.</b> <b>Inhibition</b> of L. monocytogenes was clearly pronounced in the cocultivation assay, which simulates the conditions and contamination rates present on smear cheese surfaces.

We have carried out detailed studies of the selective effect of HIM 1 on IL- 3 -mediated stimulation of hematopoietic progenitors. Preincubation of normal human bone marrow mononuclear cells, depleted of adherent cells and T cells, with HIM 1 antibody resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of IL- 3 -mediated stimulation of both erythroid burst-forming <b>units</b> (maximum <b>inhibition</b> 55 %) and granulocyte/macrophage colony-forming <b>units</b> (maximum <b>inhibition</b> 49 %). HIM 1 antibody had no effect on growth of erythroid colony-forming units in culture. In addition, preincubation of the cells with HIM 1 antibody had no deleterious effect on granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor-induced growth of either erythroid bursts or granulocyte/macrophage colonies. To be certain that the HIM 1 antibody did not react directly with IL- 3 itself, we attempted to use immunodepletion to remove IL- 3 that had been added to our culture medium. Although we were able to remove IL- 3 bioactivity by immunodepletion with anti-IL- 3 antibody bound to Sepharose beads, beads with attached HIM 1 did not remove IL- 3 activity from the medium. Polymorphonuclear neutrophils bind high levels of HIM 1, although they have very few or no detectable IL- 3 receptors. Therefore, this antibody appears to recognize a cell surface antigen that is critical for optimal IL- 3 binding and bioactivity but is not the actual IL- 3 receptor...|$|R

For comparison, {{the effect of}} intravenous muscimol (0. 5 - 2 mg/kg) and ethanol (0. 5 - 2 g/kg) was also studied. GHB produced variable effects: dose-related inhibition in 7 out of 18 (38. 8 %) neurons and no significant change in 11 out of 18 (61. 2 %) neurons tested. In contrast, muscimol and ethanol produced a dose-related inhibition of the SN-PR firing rate. The results indicate that GHB, unlike muscimol and ethanol, has no {{profound effect on the}} activity of SN-PR neurons, and thus disinhibition of dopaminergic <b>units,</b> through <b>inhibition</b> of SN-PR neurons, is probably not the mechanism by which GHB stimulates the firing rate of dopaminergic neurons...|$|R

40|$|Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells select {{specific}} replication origin sites {{within the}} dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) locus at a discrete point during G 1 phase, the origin decision point (ODP). Origin selection {{is sensitive to}} transcription but not protein synthesis inhibitors, implicating a pretranslational role for transcription in origin specification. We have constructed a DNA array covering 121 kb surrounding the DHFR locus, to comprehensively investigate replication initiation and transcription in this region. When nuclei isolated within the first 3 h of G 1 phase were stimulated to initiate replication in Xenopus egg extracts, replication initiated without any detectable preference for specific sites. At the ODP, initiation became suppressed from within the Msh 3, DHFR, and 2 BE 2121 transcription units. Active transcription was mostly confined to these transcription <b>units,</b> and <b>inhibition</b> of transcription by alpha-amanitin resulted in the initiation of replication within transcription units, indicating that transcription is necessary to limit initiation events to the intergenic region. However, the resumption of DHFR transcription after mitosis took place prior to the ODP and so is not on its own sufficient to suppress initiation of replication. Together, these results demonstrate a remarkable flexibility in sequence selection for initiating replication and implicate transcription as one important component of origin specification at the ODP...|$|R
40|$|This {{communication}} {{describes a}} two unit antisense RNA cassette system {{for use in}} gene silencing. Cassettes consist of a recognition unit and an inhibitory unit which are transcribed into a single RNA that carries sequences of non-contiguous complementarity to the chosen target RNA. The recognition unit is designed as a stem-loop for rapid formation of long- lived binding intermediates with target sequences and resembles the major stem-loop of a naturally occurring antisense RNA, CopA. The inhibitory unit consists of either a sequence complementary to a ribosome binding site or of a hairpin ribozyme targeted at a site within the chosen mRNA. The contributions of the individual <b>units</b> to <b>inhibition</b> was assessed using the lacI gene as a target. All possible combinations of recognition and inhibitory units were tested in either orientation. In general, inhibition of lacI expression was relatively low. Fifty per cent inhibition was obtained with the most effective of the constructs, carrying the recognition stem-loop in the antisense orientation and the inhibitory unit with an anti-RBS sequence. Several experiments were performed to assess activities of the RNAs in vitro and in vivo : antisense RNA binding assays, cleavage assays, secondary structure analysis as well as Northern blotting and primer extension analysis of antisense and target RNAs.

Movable range of each antennal joint was obsered and nerve responses to C-F joint movement were recorded. The nerve responses to joint movement were classified to two type responses; one is tonic type response which continued firing as joint flexion, second is phasic type which showed fast adaptation. Almost of units (about 90 %) responded with increase of firing to flexion but few <b>units</b> showed <b>inhibition.</b> Firing {{rate of the}} tonic type response depended on angle of the joint and, to a sustained flexion, the firing remained with steady rate depending on the angle. These tonic type receptors coded a joint position information. The phasic type receptor responded to a joint movement and a single cell responded to movement of only one direction (unidirectional), a flexion or an extension. Notwithstanding of steady rate of angular movement, the firing frequency reached maximum immediately after the initiation of the movement and rapidly adapted. Firing rate of these phasic unit depend on movement velocity. This phasic type response coded a movement direction and a rate. Unnatural opposite directional movement or lateral movement of the C - F joint which an animal cannot move itself caused also nerve responses.

The exposure period was from day 7 until day 20 of pregnancy. In addition, 15 pregnant rats were treated with aromatase inhibitors or testosterone to clarify the process by which diesel exhaust exerts its toxicity. The anogenital distance was significantly longer in male and female fetuses from both exhaust-exposed groups than in those of the control. Differentiation of the testis, ovary, and thymus was delayed and disturbed. Maternal testosterone and progesterone levels, which increased due to pregnancy whether or not the rats were exposed, were significantly higher and lower, respectively, in the pregnant rats exposed to total exhaust and filtered exhaust. The serum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level and urinary excretion of 17 -hydroxycorticosteroids (OHCS) did not differ among the pregnant groups.

In cells infected before interferon- 7 treatment, its addition could be delayed up to 2 h after the infection to produce an inhibition of virus yield greater than 1 log 10 <b>unit</b> (90 ~ <b>inhibition).</b> We conclude that interferon-y acts on an intracellular step before or at adenovirus protein synthesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{fibroblast}} {{growth factor}}/fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGF/FGFR) signaling pathway plays crucial roles in cell proliferation, angiogenesis, migration, and survival. Aberration in FGFRs correlates with several malignancies and disorders. FGFRs {{have proved to}} be attractive targets for therapeutic intervention in cancer, and it is of high interest to find FGFR inhibitors with novel scaffolds. In this study, a combinatorial three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3 D-QSAR) model was developed based on previously reported FGFR 1 inhibitors with diverse structural skeletons. This model was evaluated for its prediction performance on a diverse test set containing 232 FGFR inhibitors, and it yielded a SD value of 0. 75 pIC 50 <b>units</b> from measured <b>inhibition</b> affinities and a Pearson‚Äôs correlation coefficient R 2 of 0. 53. This result suggests that the combinatorial 3 D-QSAR model could be used to search for new FGFR 1 hit structures and predict their potential activity. To further evaluate the performance of the model, a decoy set validation was used to measure the efficiency of the model by calculating EF (enrichment factor). Based on the combinatorial pharmacophore model, a virtual screening against SPECS database was performed. Nineteen novel active compounds were successfully identified, which provide new chemical starting points for further structural optimization of FGFR 1 inhibitors...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Since matrix metalloproteinase- 2 (MMP- 2) is an {{important}} marker of tumor malignancy, we developed an original drug design strategy, MMP- 2 activity dependent anchoring probes (MDAP), for use in MMP- 2 activity imaging, and evaluated the usefulness of this probe in in vitro and in vivo experiments. Methods: We designed and synthesized MDAP 1000, MDAP 3000, and MDAP 5000, which consist of 4 independent moieties: RI unit (111 In hydrophilic chelate), MMP- 2 substrate unit (short peptide), anchoring unit (alkyl chain), and anchoring <b>inhibition</b> <b>unit</b> (polyethylene glycol (PEGn; where n represents the approximate molecular weight, n = 1000, 3000, and 5000). Probe cleavage was evaluated by chromatography after MMP- 2 treatment. Cellular uptake of the probes was then measured. Radioactivity accumulation in tumor xenografts was evaluated after intravenous injection of the probes, and probe cleavage was evaluated in tumor homogenates. Results: MDAP 1000, MDAP 3000, and MDAP 5000 were cleaved by MMP- 2 in a concentration-dependent manner. MDAP 3000 pretreated with MMP- 2 showed higher accumulation in tumor cells, and was completely blocked by additional treatment with an MMP inhibitor. MDAP 3000 exhibited rapid blood clearance and a high tumor accumulation after intravenous injection in a rodent model. Furthermore, pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that MDAP 3000 exhibited a considerably slow washout rate from tumors to blood. A certain fraction of cleaved MDAP 3000 existed in tumor xenografts in vivo...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Orthodontic {{treatment}} with fixed brackets {{plays a major}} role on the formation of white spot lesions. Objective This study aimed to incorporate silver nanoparticle solutions (AgNP) in an orthodontic adhesive and evaluate its physicochemical and antimicrobial properties. Material and Methods Silver nanoparticle solutions were added to a commercial adhesive in different concentrations (w/w) : 0 %, 0. 11 %, 0. 18 %, and 0. 33 %. Shear bond strength (SBS) test was performed after bonding metal brackets to enamel. Raman spectroscopy was used to analyze in situ the degree of conversion (DC) of the adhesive layer. The surface free energy (SFE) was evaluated after the measurement of contact angles. Growth inhibition of Streptococcus mutans in liquid and solid media was determined by colony-forming <b>unit</b> count and <b>inhibition</b> halo, respectively. One-way ANOVA was performed for SBS, DC, SFE, and growth inhibition. Results The incorporation of AgNP solution decreased the SBS (p< 0. 001) and DC in situ (p< 0. 001) values. SFE decreased after addition of 0. 18 % and 0. 33 % AgNP. Growth inhibition of S. mutans in liquid media was obtained after silver addition (p< 0. 05). Conclusions The addition of AgNP solutions to Transbond&# 8482; XT adhesive primer inhibited S. mutans growth. SBS, DC, and SFE values decreased after incorporation up to 0. 33 % AgNP solution without compromising the chemical and physical properties of the adhesive...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{possible}} {{interaction among}} different sensory {{units in the}} frog tongue was studied using several single papillae dually innervated by the medial and lateral branches of the glossopharyngeal (IXth) nerve. The afferent activity in one branch exposed to NaCI stimulation of the papilla revealed marked inhibition after antidromic electrical stimulation (100 Hz, 30 s, and 3 V) of the other branch. The degree of inhibition depended {{on the number of}} sensory responses observed in the electrically stimulated branch as well as the nature of the stimulated sensory units. Statistical analysis suggested that antidromic activation of gustatory units conducting the responses to NaC 1 and quinine and slowly adapting mechanosensitive units produced a large antidromic inhibition amounting to 19 - 25 %, but that of gustatory units conducting the responses to acetic acid and rapidly adapting mechanosensitive units gave rise to only a slight inhibition. To examine the differential effects of these sensory <b>units</b> in antidromic <b>inhibition,</b> antidromic impulses were evoked by chemical stimulation of the adjacent papilla neuronally connected with the dually innervated papilla under study. Antidromic volleys of impulses elicited by NaCI or quinine stimulation produced a large inhibition of the afferent activity in the other branch, as induced by NaC 1 stimulation of the dually innervated papilla. Plausible mechanisms of synaptic interaction in peripheral gustatory systems are considered...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) {{causes a}} serious {{infectious}} disease in birds {{that results in}} severe losses in the worldwide poultry industry. Despite vaccination, NDV outbreaks have increased the necessity of alternative prevention and control measures. Several recent studies focused on antiviral compounds obtained from natural resources. Many extracts from marine organisms have been isolated and tested for pharmacological purposes, and their antiviral activity has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. Fucoidan is a sulfated polysaccharide present in the cell wall matrix of brown algae that has been demonstrated to inhibit certain enveloped viruses with low toxicity. This study evaluated the potential antiviral activity and the mechanism of action of fucoidan from Cladosiphon okamuranus against NDV in the Vero cell line. Methods The cytotoxicity of fucoidan {{was determined by the}} MTT assay. To study its antiviral activity, fusion and plaque-forming <b>unit</b> (PFU) <b>inhibition</b> assays were conducted. The mechanism of action was determined by time of addition, fusion inhibition, and penetration assays. The NDV vaccine strain (La Sota) was used in the fusion inhibition assays. PFU and Western blot experiments were performed using a wild-type lentogenic NDV strain. Results Fucoidan exhibited antiviral activity against NDV La Sota, with an obtained IS 50 > 2000. In time of addition studies, we observed viral inhibition {{in the early stages of}} infection (0 ‚Äì 60 min post-infection). The inhibition of viral penetration experiments with a wild-type NDV strain supported this result, as these experiments demonstrated a 48 % decrease in viral infection as well as reduced HN protein expression. Ribavirin, which was used as an antiviral control, exhibited lower antiviral activity than fucoidan and high toxicity at active doses. In the fusion assays, the number of syncytia was significantly reduced (70 % inhibition) when fucoidan was added before cleavage of the fusion protein, perhaps indicating a specific interaction between fucoidan and the F 0 protein. Conclusion The results of this study suggest that fucoidan from C. okamuranus represents a potential low-toxicity antiviral compound for the poultry industry, and our findings provide a better understanding of the mode of action of sulfated polysaccharides. </p...|$|R
40|$|Rat peritoneal macrophages {{are known}} to contain a chymotrypsin-like neutral {{protease}} associated with a specific inhibitor. By homogenizing the cells in 0. 25 M sucrose (pH 8. 0) containing 0. 5 % Triton X- 100, both the protease and the inhibitor {{were found to be}} localized in the nuclei, particularly in chromatin. The inhibitory factor in chromatin was then separated from the protease by hydroxylapatite gel chromatography in the presence of 2 M NaQ and 5 M urea. The inhibitor fraction obtained was deproteinized by digestion with Pronase and subsequent extraction with phenol; these treatments did not alter the inhibitory potency. The deproteinized inhibitor fraction had a UV absorption ratio, AujAta 0, of 0. 61, but it was resistant to digestion with various nucleases, including DNase 1, nuclease PI, and snake venom phosphodiesterase. However, when it was incubated with poIy(ADP-ribose) glyco-hydrolase from calf thymus, the inhibitory potency was markedly decreased. An authentic poly(ADP-ribose), with a mean chain length of approximately 30 ADP-ribose <b>units,</b> produced significant <b>inhibition</b> of the neutral protease isolated from macrophage chromatin. No such inhibition was produced by DNA, single-stranded DNA, RNA, polyadenylate, polyuridylate, polycytidylate, or monomeric ADP-ribose. We have previously reported the occurrence of a neutral protease in the lysate of rat peritonea] macrophages (1). The enzyme was found to be a chymotrypsin-like protease; it was extracted from the 105, 000 g pellet fraction with 1 M KC 1.
