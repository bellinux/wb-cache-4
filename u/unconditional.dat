5|$|At the Casablanca Conference {{in early}} 1943, the Allies reiterated the {{statements}} issued in the 1942 Declaration by the United Nations, and demanded the <b>unconditional</b> surrender of their enemies.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} hours of 1 May, Krebs talked to General Chuikov, {{commander}} of the Soviet 8th Guards Army, informing him of Hitler's death and a willingness to negotiate a citywide surrender. They could not agree on terms because of Soviet insistence on <b>unconditional</b> surrender and Krebs' claim that he lacked authorisation to agree to that. Goebbels was against surrender. In the afternoon, Goebbels and his wife killed their children and then themselves. Goebbels's death removed the last impediment which prevented Weidling from accepting the terms of <b>unconditional</b> surrender of his garrison, but he chose to delay the surrender until the next morning to allow the planned breakout to take place under the cover of darkness.|$|E
5|$|German forces {{surrendered}} in Italy on 29 April. Total and <b>unconditional</b> surrender {{was signed}} on 7 May, {{to be effective}} {{by the end of}} 8 May. German Army Group Centre resisted in Prague until 11 May.|$|E
5|$|In {{some of the}} {{paintings}} of Henry Hudson, Young Sen – a Chinese scientific prodigy who has been offered an <b>unconditional</b> place at King's to read medicine – is depicted in his biographical painting series, showing {{the rise and fall}} of the protagonist.|$|E
5|$|Mary Kay Place as Sister Gladys Davis, Aaron's deeply {{religious}} mother, who, despite showing <b>unconditional</b> {{love and affection}} toward Aaron before he leaves for Los Angeles, cannot {{accept the fact that}} her son is gay.|$|E
5|$|On July 2, 2008, it was {{reported}} that Favre was in contact with the Packers about a possible return to the team. On July 11, 2008, Favre {{sent a letter to the}} Packers asking for his <b>unconditional</b> release to allow him to play for another NFL team. Packers general manager Ted Thompson announced he would not grant Favre an <b>unconditional</b> release and reaffirmed the organization's commitment to Aaron Rodgers as its new quarterback. Complicating matters was Favre's unique contract giving him the leverage to void any potential trade by not reporting to the camp of the team he might be traded to if the Packers elect to go that route.|$|E
5|$|On June 17, 2014, the Canucks placed Booth on <b>unconditional</b> waivers, and the {{following}} day after he cleared waivers the Canucks used their final compliance buyouts on him and Booth became an unrestricted free agent.|$|E
5|$|Sir: Yours of {{this date}} proposing Armistice, and {{appointment}} of Commissioners, to settle terms of Capitulation is just received. No terms except <b>unconditional</b> and immediate surrender can be accepted.|$|E
5|$|The album's lyrical content {{generally}} {{revolves around}} {{a theme of}} <b>unconditional</b> love and a concept MercyMe has called 'loving well'. Other lyrical themes include worship and selflessness.|$|E
5|$|Although Fuchs {{had given}} Ruth his <b>unconditional</b> release, no major league team {{expressed}} an interest in hiring him in any capacity. Ruth still hoped to be hired as a manager if he could not play anymore, but only one managerial position, Cleveland, became available between Ruth's retirement {{and the end of the}} 1937 season. Asked if he had considered Ruth for the job, Indians owner Alva Bradley replied negatively.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the losses}} {{that had brought}} the Allies to the border of their homeland, German morale was {{surprisingly}} strong. The men knew the Allies were demanding an <b>unconditional</b> surrender. They were now fighting for the fatherland, defending the soil of their country, not just fighting for Hitler.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the 1681 Scottish Test Act {{required}} {{all public}} officials and MPs to swear <b>unconditional</b> {{loyalty to the}} King but with the crucial qualifier they 'promise to uphold the true Protestant religion.' Tolerance for James' personal Catholicism did not extend to Catholicism in general and his failure to understand this resulted in his deposition and exile by the Glorious Revolution.|$|E
5|$|Jackson {{missed the}} next five {{baseball}} seasons as he battled tuberculosis, eventually returning to manage in the Boston Braves/Milwaukee Braves system for the Jackson Senators in the Class-B Southeastern League in 1946. Jackson returned to the Giants to coach in 1947 and 1948, receiving his <b>unconditional</b> release following the 1948 season.|$|E
5|$|Many major {{ports and}} {{positions}} {{were incorporated into}} the Atlantic Wall, receiving heavy fortifications. Hitler ordered all positions {{to fight to the}} end, and some of them remained in German hands until Germany's <b>unconditional</b> surrender. Several of the port fortresses were resupplied by submarines after being surrounded by Allied Forces. The defenders of these positions included foreign volunteers and Waffen-SS troops.|$|E
5|$|Saigō Takamori led {{the victorious}} {{imperial}} forces {{north and east}} through Japan, winning the Battle of Kōshū-Katsunuma. He eventually surrounded Edo in May 1868, leading to its <b>unconditional</b> defeat after Katsu Kaishū, the Shogun's Army Minister, negotiated the surrender. Some groups continued to resist after this surrender but were defeated in the Battle of Ueno on 4 July 1868.|$|E
5|$|Salford {{developed}} several civic institutions; in 1806, Chapel Street {{became the}} first street {{in the world to}} be lit by gas (supplied by Phillips and Lee's cotton mill). In 1850, {{under the terms of the}} Museums Act 1845, the municipal borough council established the Royal Museum and Public Library, said to have been the first <b>unconditional</b> free public library in England, preceding the Public Libraries Act 1850.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II, in 1939, the International Secretariat was moved to New York City. The resident International Executive Committee failed to meet, largely because of a struggle in the U.S. Socialist Workers Party (SWP) between Trotsky's supporters and the tendency of Max Shachtman, Martin Abern and James Burnham. The secretariat was composed of those committee members {{who happened to be}} in the city, most of whom were co-thinkers of Shachtman. The disagreement centred on the Shachtmanites' disagreements with the SWP's internal policy, and over the FI's <b>unconditional</b> defence of the USSR.|$|E
5|$|By late {{afternoon}} Béxar {{was occupied by}} about 1,500 Mexican soldiers. When the Mexican troops raised a blood-red flag signifying no quarter, Travis responded with a blast from the Alamo's largest cannon. Believing that Travis had acted hastily, Bowie sent Jameson to meet with Santa Anna. Travis was angered that Bowie had acted unilaterally and sent his own representative, Captain Albert Martin. Both emissaries met with Colonel Juan Almonte and José Bartres. According to Almonte, the Texians asked for an honorable surrender but were informed that any surrender must be <b>unconditional.</b> On learning this, Bowie and Travis mutually agreed to fire the cannon again.|$|E
5|$|Chesbro {{met with}} Highlanders owner Frank J. Farrell and new manager Harry Wolverton in February 1912 about {{attempting}} a comeback. Wolverton {{agreed to give}} Chesbro a chance at pitching for the Highlanders. However, before leaving for camp he reconsidered and released Chesbro. Chesbro's request for reinstatement {{as a free agent}} was granted in March, while the Highlanders granted him his <b>unconditional</b> release. Chesbro decided to travel to Hot Springs, Arkansas, where teams participated in spring training, in an attempt to find a team willing to give him a chance at a comeback. He worked out with Brooklyn and Pittsburgh, but both teams passed on him.|$|E
5|$|Churchill's and the British {{response}} was officially restrained. This {{was due to}} the strong-willed defence of the Belgian defensive campaign presented to the cabinet by Sir Roger Keyes at 11:30am 28 May. The French and Belgian ministers had referred to Leopold's actions as treacherous, but they were unaware of the true events: Leopold had not signed an agreement with Hitler in order to form a collaborative government, but an <b>unconditional</b> surrender as Commander-in-Chief of the Belgian Armed Forces.|$|E
5|$|Enunciation of the Truman Doctrine {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of a US bipartisan defense and foreign policy consensus between Republicans and Democrats focused on containment and deterrence that weakened during and after the Vietnam War, but ultimately persisted thereafter. Moderate and conservative parties in Europe, as well as social democrats, gave virtually <b>unconditional</b> support to the Western alliance, while European and American Communists, financed by the KGB and involved in its intelligence operations, adhered to Moscow's line, although dissent began to appear after 1956. Other critiques of the consensus policy came from anti-Vietnam War activists, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and the anti-nuclear movement.|$|E
5|$|In 1738, the Synod {{moved to}} {{restrict}} itinerant preaching and to tighten educational requirements for ministers, actions the New Side resented. Tensions {{between the two}} sides continued to escalate until the Synod of May 1741, which ended with a definite split between the two factions. The Old Side retained control of the Synod of Philadelphia, and it immediately required <b>unconditional</b> subscription to the Westminster Confession with no option to state scruples. The New Side founded the Synod of New York. The new Synod required subscription to the Westminster Confession in accordance with the Adopting Act, but no college degrees were required for ordination.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, Johnson's life's {{work was}} almost {{destroyed}} when his caretaker declared him {{unable to pay}} further storage fees. Instead, Helen Harriton, Mary Beattie Brady, and others arranged with the court to have Johnson's belongings delivered to the Harmon Foundation with <b>unconditional</b> rights over all works. The foundation would use the works to advance interracial understanding and support African American achievements in the fine arts. On April 19, 1967, the Harmon Foundation gave more than 1,000 paintings, watercolors, and prints by Johnson to the Smithsonian American Art Museum.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} year of his {{contract}} extension with the Sabres in the 2014–15 season, Hodgson suffered the worst season in his professional career, contributing with just 6 goals and 13 points in 78 outings for the cellar-dwelling Sabres. With the option to buy-out his contract at a lower rate due to his age, on June 29, 2015, the Sabres, {{in the midst of a}} rebuild, placed Hodgson on <b>unconditional</b> waivers in order for a release to free agency.|$|E
5|$|Jovanovski {{signed a}} four-year, $16.5 million {{contract}} {{to return to}} the Florida Panthers on July 1, 2011. He played a large role in helping reshape the franchise's rebuilding and drive to make the playoffs. Beginning in his second year after rejoining the Panthers, he served as team captain for the 2012–13 and 2013–14 seasons. On June 29, 2014, Jovanovski was placed on <b>unconditional</b> waivers for the purpose of a buyout. Jovanovski remained inactive in the NHL during the 2014–15 season. On December 28, 2015 Jovanovski announced his retirement from the NHL.|$|E
5|$|News of the {{outbreak}} of war took five months to reach the Indian Ocean but British forces, recently engaged in the Third Anglo-Mysore War, were mobilised in preparation and immediately seized the ports of French India. Only Pondicherry was able to resist, and a siege was instigated on 1 August 1793 by Colonel John Braithwaite while Cornwallis imposed a naval blockade. British forces constructed trenches and batteries, often under heavy fire, over the following weeks. Twenty days after the city was cut off, Braithwaite began a bombardment of the defences. Within hours the French commander Colonel Prosper de Clermont requested a truce, followed the next morning by an <b>unconditional</b> surrender.|$|E
5|$|On 20 August 1934, civil {{servants}} {{were required to}} swear an oath of <b>unconditional</b> obedience to Hitler; a similar oath had been required of members of the military several weeks prior. This law became the basis of the Führerprinzip, the concept that Hitler's word overrode all existing laws. Any acts that were sanctioned by Hitler—even murder—thus became legal. All legislation proposed by cabinet ministers had to be approved by the office of Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess, who also had a veto over top civil service appointments.|$|E
5|$|On November 29, 1934, {{while the}} rest of the team was playing in Omiya, Berg went to Saint Luke's Hospital in Tsukiji, ostensibly to visit the {{daughter}} of American ambassador Joseph Grew. Instead, Berg sneaked onto the roof of the hospital, one of the tallest buildings in Tokyo, and filmed the city and harbor with his movie camera. He never did see the ambassador's daughter. Back at home, the Indians gave him his <b>unconditional</b> release. Berg continued on to the Philippines, Korea and Moscow.|$|E
5|$|On October 14, 2013, Rome was {{activated}} from injured {{reserve and}} {{was assigned to}} the Texas Stars of the AHL for conditioning. During the 2013–14 season, Rome played 7 games in the AHL with the Texas Stars, and 25 games with the Dallas Stars, scoring no goals and just one assist with the NHL club. On June 16, 2014, Rome was placed on <b>unconditional</b> waivers by the Dallas Stars, and the following day (after he cleared waivers) Dallas confirmed their use of a compliance buyout, allowing the team to save salary cap space by removing the final year of his three-year, $4.5 million contract, from the team's salary calculations.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 1 May (thirteen hours after the event), Stalin was {{informed}} of Hitler's suicide. General Hans Krebs had given this information to Soviet General Vasily Chuikov when they met at 04:00 on 1 May, when the Germans attempted to negotiate acceptable surrender terms. Stalin demanded <b>unconditional</b> surrender and asked for confirmation that Hitler was dead. He wanted Hitler's corpse found. In {{the early morning hours}} of 2 May, the Soviets captured the Reich Chancellery. Down in the Führerbunker, General Krebs and General Wilhelm Burgdorf committed suicide by gunshot to the head.|$|E
5|$|Shapiro {{responds}} to Goodin's argument by challenging his factual assumption that individuals would starve if they refused the workfare throffer. In state-sponsored (see welfare state) workfare systems, he claims, only monetary assistance is eliminated by {{a refusal to}} accept the throffer, while in private systems (that is, non-state charities or organisations offering conditional aid), other groups than the one operating a workfare system exist. In either system, recipients of welfare may also turn {{to family and friends}} for help. For these reasons, he does not consider the throffer to be unrefusable in the cases in which Goodin believes it is. A second (and, Shapiro claims, more important) objection is also presented. State welfare without sanctions fails to mirror the way that working individuals who do not rely on welfare payments take responsibility for their lives. If a person who works stops working, Shapiro observes, then they will typically find their economic situation worsened. <b>Unconditional</b> state welfare does not reflect this, and instead reflects the unusual position of the person who would be no worse off if they refused to work. As <b>unconditional</b> welfare does not mirror the situation of ordinary workers, it is unable {{to determine whether or not}} people are willing to take responsibility for their lives.|$|E
5|$|Strong became Head of the German Section at MI14 in August 1939, {{shortly before}} the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War. He commanded the 4th/5th Battalion, Royal Scots Fusiliers in 1941, before becoming Brigadier General Staff (BGS) for Intelligence at Home Forces in 1942. In March 1943, Strong was appointed Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence (G-2) at General Dwight D. Eisenhower's Allied Force Headquarters (AFHQ). He attended the Italian peace negotiations. In May 1944 he joined Eisenhower's Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF), and played a leading part in the negotiations for the <b>unconditional</b> surrender of Germany in 1945.|$|E
5|$|The Bears {{started the}} first of ten OTAs on May 13. Rookie Kyle Long did not attend due to the University of Oregon having final {{examinations}} running through June 14. Gabe Carimi was the lone eligible player to not attend the workouts on the first day, as he stated that he was training in Arizona. Despite being expected to attend the team's mandatory minicamp, on June 9, Carimi {{was traded to the}} Buccaneers for an <b>unconditional</b> sixth-round draft pick in the 2014 draft. Long returned to workouts on June 17.|$|E
5|$|The DAP also {{focused on}} landholding issues. Chong Chieng Jen, the {{director}} of the DAP's by-election campaign, pointed out that those who decided not to renew their 60-year land leases would have their land returned to the government without compensation, and that even if the government approved requests to have leases renewed, landholders would have to pay large premiums. Chong said that the DAP on the other hand wanted the current state land code to be amended to allow for the automatic and <b>unconditional</b> renewal of all leased land for a period of 99 years.|$|E
5|$|Throughout July the {{battalion}} undertook garrison duties in Trieste before the 2nd New Zealand Division was withdrawn to Lake Trasimene. On 15 August 1945 news was received of Japan's <b>unconditional</b> surrender, ending plans for {{the battalion}} {{to take part in}} further combat in the Pacific. In September it was decided that as part of the departure of New Zealand troops from the theatre, memorial services would be held at the locations of the division's major battles. As a part of this program services were held at Cassino and Sangro and on Crete, while smaller parties were sent to Coriano Ridge, Faenza, Forli, Padua, Monfalcone and Udine.|$|E
5|$|Uanna {{also looked}} after {{security}} at other bases {{that might be}} used by the 509th in an emergency, such as Iwo Jima. He supervised the loading of the Little Boy bomb into the Enola Gay, and during the bombing of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, {{he was in charge of}} a communications center on Iwo Jima that relayed messages back to Tinian. He was therefore one of the first people to know that Hiroshima was the target, and that it had been attacked. After the subsequent <b>unconditional</b> surrender of Japan, he accompanied the Manhattan Project team sent to survey the damage, spending four weeks in Nagasaki.|$|E
