5|$|<b>Ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> {{from the}} Sun breaks water {{molecules}} apart, {{reducing the amount}} of water available to form noctilucent clouds. The radiation is known to vary cyclically with the solar cycle and satellites have been tracking the decrease in brightness of the clouds with the increase of <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> for the last two solar cycles. It has been found that changes in the clouds follow changes in the intensity of ultraviolet rays by about a year, but the reason for this long lag is not yet known.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{atmosphere}} is very effective at absorbing high energy electromagnetic radiation such as x-rays and gamma rays, so {{these types of}} radiation would not reach any dangerous levels at the surface during the burst event itself. The immediate effect on life on Earth from a GRB within a few parsecs would only be a short increase in <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> at ground level, lasting from {{less than a second}} to tens of seconds. This <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> could potentially reach dangerous levels depending on the exact nature and distance of the burst, but it seems unlikely to be able to cause a global catastrophe for life on Earth.|$|E

40|$|During the day {{human skin}} may {{be exposed to}} {{sunlight}} <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiations.</b> These rays can be of the three types: “A” (from 320 to 400 nm), “B” (from 230 to 320 nm) and “C” (from 200 to 290 nm). It is useful the use of different sunscreens to prevent radiations negative effects on human skin. The aim of solar cosmetic products for skin is not to increase {{the total number of}} exposure hours to sunlight, but to reduce the risks derived by <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiations</b> esposition. In fact sunlight protection products tend to prevent: erythema, sunburns, dermatosis, photo-aging and cutaneous cancer. Ideal sunscreen product must be: efficacy, pleasant in the cosmetic use, resistant to the water and to the sweat. On the same time, it would be safe and no toxic. Therefore a sunscreen must reduce the total amount of <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiations,</b> and it must leave unchanged the quality of the <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiations.</b> In this paper, the Authors report the results of photo-protective efficacy of a solar product containing two new filters (Tinosorb S and Tinosorb M) and an innovative emulsion RoC pateneted (Silsoft® Surface System...|$|R

40|$|The major {{alteration}} in photoaged skin is {{the deposition}} of {{massive amounts of}} abnormal elastic material, termed solar elastosis. In previous work, {{it has been shown}} that solar elastosis is accompanied by increased abundance of elastin and fibrillin mRNAs and upregulation of elastin promoter activity. Using a transgenic mouse line, which expresses the human elastin promoter, linked to a chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase reporter gene, in a tissue-specific and developmentally regulated manner, we investigated the effects of <b>ultraviolet</b> A <b>radiation</b> and <b>ultraviolet</b> B <b>radiation</b> on human elastin promoter activity in vivo and in vitro. Irradiation of mice with a single dose of <b>ultraviolet</b> B <b>radiation</b> (491. 4 mJ/cm 2) resulted in an increase up to 8. 5 -fold in promoter activity, whereas a more modest increase of 1. 8 -fold was measured with <b>ultraviolet</b> A <b>radiation</b> (38. 2 J/cm 2). In addition, in vitro studies revealed over a thirtyfold increase in elastin promoter activity in response to <b>ultraviolet</b> B <b>radiation</b> (55 mJ/cm 2), whereas no change was measured in response to <b>ultraviolet</b> A <b>radiation</b> (2. 2 J/cm 2). These results confirm the role of <b>ultraviolet</b> B <b>radiation</b> in elastin promoter activation in photoaging, and identify <b>ultraviolet</b> A <b>radiation</b> as a contributing factor. This system should serve as a useful in vivo and in vitro model to study cutaneous photoaging, and for testing compounds that may protect against cutaneous photodamage...|$|R
5|$|The region's climate {{has been}} dry since the Tertiary. The area around Licancabur is {{dominated}} by year-round high pressure caused by the South Pacific High, giving it a very sunny climate. Because {{of the lack of}} moisture, solar radiation energy is dissipated primarily by wind. In the Llano de Chajnantor area, wind generally reaches its maximum strength during the day. Its prevailing direction is from the west, except in summer when winds are more variable. Because of the area's tropical location (where the ozone layer is thinner) and high altitude, it receives a large amount of <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation.</b> The world's highest level of <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> was reported from Licancabur, although the high irradiation might have caused measurement artifacts.|$|E

40|$|Langerhans cells capture {{exogenous}} antigens through fluid phase pinocytosis and {{receptor-mediated endocytosis}} and migrate to lymph nodes, where they present processed antigen to T cells. <b>Ultraviolet</b> B <b>radiation</b> impairs the antigen-presenting function of Langerhans cells, resulting in antigen-specific immunosuppression of contact hypersensitivity. We tested {{the notion that}} <b>ultraviolet</b> B <b>radiation</b> inhibits the endocytic activity of Langerhans cells, leading to impaired migration and maturation. Human monocyte-derived Langerhans cell-like dendritic cells that took up lucifer yellow or fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran exclusively migrated in response to 6 Ckine/secondary lymphoid chemokine, and matured, as evidenced {{by an increase in}} CD 54 and CD 86 expression and potent stimulatory activity in allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction. Exposing Langerhans cell-like dendritic cells to 20 – 40 mJ per cm 2 of <b>ultraviolet</b> B <b>radiation</b> reduced their endocytic activity in fluid phase pinocytosis (measured by uptake of lucifer yellow) and in receptor-mediated endocytosis (measured by uptake of fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran). Membrane ruffling and CD 32 expression were also suppressed by <b>ultraviolet</b> B <b>radiation.</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> B-irradiated, endocytosing Langerhans cell-like dendritic cells had less movement towards 6 Ckine, expressed less CD 54 and CD 86, and had less effective stimulatory activity in allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction than nonirradiated, endocytosing Langerhans cell-like dendritic cells. Endocytosis upregulated tumor necrosis factor α production by Langerhans cell-like dendritic cells, but prior <b>ultraviolet</b> B <b>radiation</b> inhibited this enhancement. These data suggested that impaired endocytosis and subsequent inhibitory migration and maturation of Langerhans cells by <b>ultraviolet</b> B <b>radiation</b> could contribute to local immunosuppression of contact hypersensitivity...|$|R

40|$|Expression of {{intercellular}} adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1) is {{a prerequisite}} for the capacity of cells to physically interact with leukocytes. <b>Ultraviolet</b> B <b>radiation</b> previously was found to inhibit interferon γ-induced ICAM- 1 expression in human keratinocytes by suppressing interferon γ-mediated upregulation of ICAM- 1 mRNA levels. Because <b>ultraviolet</b> B <b>radiation</b> induces photoproducts in cellular DNA, the potential role of ultraviolet B radiation-induced DNA damage in this system was assessed. For this purpose, cells from a normal donor were compared with cells from patients with xeroderma pigmentosum from complementation groups C and D. Xeroderma pigmentosum cells are defective in the removal of ultraviolet B radiation-induced DNA lesions, and thus lower <b>ultraviolet</b> B <b>radiation</b> doses are required to retain equivalent numbers of DNA photoproducts at a given time point after irradiation. In the present study, <b>ultraviolet</b> B <b>radiation</b> inhibited interferon γ-induced ICAM- 1 mRNA expression in primary human skin fibroblasts in a manner identical to that previously observed for keratinocytes. Comparative studies employing normal versus xeroderma pigmentosum fibroblasts revealed that in xeroderma pigmentosum fibroblasts, two- to threefold lower <b>ultraviolet</b> B <b>radiation</b> doses were required to achieve inhibition equivalent to that observed in normal fibroblasts. In irradiated normal cells, inhibition of interferon γ-induced ICAM- 1 mRNA expression was transient and restored 12 h after <b>ultraviolet</b> B <b>radiation</b> exposure. In contrast, in xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group D cells, no restoration could be observed for up to 48 h, but responsiveness was restored in xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C cells after 24 h. These studies indicate that ultraviolet B radiation-induced inhibition of interferon γ-mediated ICAM- 1 expression involves the generation of DNA photoproducts...|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} {{demonstrates that}} <b>ultraviolet</b> A <b>radiation</b> (UVA) contributes to photoaging, {{which results in}} the accumulation of massive amounts of abnormal elastic material in the dermis of photoaged skin. To study UVA-induced photoaging in an in vivo system, we utilized a line of transgenic mice containing the human elastin promoter linked to a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase reporter gene. Our prior work demonstrates promoter activation in response to <b>ultraviolet</b> B <b>radiation</b> (UVB), UVA, and psoralen plus <b>ultraviolet</b> A <b>radiation</b> in the skin of these mice. The addition of psoralen (8 -MOP) prior to administration of UVA results in substantial increases in promoter activation, as compared with UVA alone. To demonstrate the utility of these mice {{as a model of}} UVA-induced photodamage, we administered four lotions to the skin of our transgenic mice that included: a sunscreen containing octyl methoxycinnamate and benzophenone- 3 with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15, the UVA filter butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane, the SPF 15 sunscreen and the UVA filter together, and the lotion vehicle alone. Following sunscreen administration, mice received a single psoralen plus <b>ultraviolet</b> A <b>radiation</b> treatment. All sunscreens decreased chloramphenicol acetyl transferase activity with the SPF 15 sunscreen, the UVA filter, and the combination SPF 15 sunscreen and UVA filter, resulting in increasing degrees of protection against psoralen plus <b>ultraviolet</b> A <b>radiation.</b> These results demonstrate that this model functions as a rapid and sensitive model of UVA photodamage for the identification and comparison of compounds that protect against UVA-induced photoaging...|$|R

5|$|Interstellar {{molecules}} {{are formed}} by chemical reactions within very sparse interstellar or circumstellar {{clouds of dust}} and gas.
