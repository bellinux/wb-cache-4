And then we just sewed it together. It was rather like the way we'd been working on the dance remixes we'd been doing before. Kind of a cut-and-paste method.|$|E
25|$|In 1960, fed <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> of the {{excessive}} taxation and union pressure, Phillip K. Wrigley sold {{the ship to}} a group of investors, known as M.G.R.S. President, Charlie Stillwell, and Vice President, Vern Maynard who was also President of Channel Concessions, ran the ship, as well as managed the Casino Ballroom during the early to mid-1960s.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, the mass-produced {{undergarment}} industry was booming, and competition forced producers to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> sorts of innovative and gimmicky designs to compete. The Hanes company emerged from this boom and quickly established {{itself as a}} top manufacturer of union suits, which were common until the 1930s. Textile technology continued to improve, and {{the time to make}} a single union suit dropped from days to minutes.|$|E

25|$|Ties rarely occur, since {{multiple}} simultaneous player eliminations will {{rank the}} eliminated players by chip counts. However, if {{two or more}} players are eliminated in one hand, and both players started the hand with identical chip counts, the players will be tied in official rankings. It is impossible for poker tournaments to end in a tie (since one player must end <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> the chips), though multiple players may be tied for second (or lower) place.|$|E

He claims the recording will capture their souls, and through looping they will relive that week forever and he will spend eternity with the woman he loves. Although Morel does not mention her by name, the fugitive is sure he is talking about Faustine.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, Microsoft {{embarked}} on a project code-named Pyramid to completely rewrite Microsoft Word from the ground up. Both the Windows and Mac OS versions would start from the same code base. It was abandoned when {{it was determined that}} it would take the development team too long to rewrite and then catch <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> the new capabilities that could have been added in the same time without a rewrite. Instead, the next versions of Word for Windows and Mac OS, dubbed version 6.0, both started from the code base of Word for Windows 2.0.|$|E

After her documentary, My Candidate, is met with an underwhelming response at an independent film festival, Robert Redford advises her that her film is lacking and she should do follow <b>ups</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> the people from the 1988 campaign to see what they are doing now, and get their reflections on their past roles.|$|R

25|$|Full {{preparations}} for the 2003 contest began on 18 May 2003 at the Skonto Hall. There were rehearsals, press conferences and participants were also involved in an internet chat. Two dress rehearsals were held on 23 May, {{in front of an}} estimated 12,000 people. The organisers of the contest held a press conference; one of the issues complained about was the lack of invitations for the after-party. The final dress rehearsal was held on 24 May, the day of the contest. A simulation of the voting procedure was also held, in which the presenters linked <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> twenty-six countries by satellite for the first time.|$|E
25|$|When the {{publisher}} PlayFirst's blog staff interviewed with the game's producer Ryan Sindledecker, he gave players an in depth look at Dream Chronicles: The Book of Air. Taking about {{coming up with}} the new features, Ryan shared that the developer, Kat Games came <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> the new features, including using Dream Jewels as powers. With each Dream Chronicles game, Dream Jewels were used differently. In The Book of Air there was a need to add these powers and a need to have a new use for the Jewels and they just fit together perfectly. After the Standard Edition of the game was released, Sindledecker uploaded a special walkthrough for The Book of Air on PlayFirst's blog.|$|E
25|$|In {{the climax}} of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Percy returns {{to his family and}} manages to make <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> of them, and {{eventually}} duels new Minister for Magic and Voldemort puppet Pius Thicknesse in the Battle of Hogwarts. While dueling Thicknesse, Percy announces that he is resigning, the first joke he has made in many years, much to Fred's delight. While dueling alongside Percy, his brother Fred Weasley is killed in an explosion, and Percy clings to the corpse and shields it from further damage. In {{the last part of the}} battle, he and his father work together to defeat Thicknesse. His final appearance is in the book's epilogue, at King's Cross Station, talking loudly about broom regulations.|$|E

25|$|At {{approximately}} 03:00 on April 24, {{the fleet}} {{got under way}} {{and headed for the}} gap in the chain that had blocked the channel. Soon after passing that obstacle, they were spotted by men in the forts, which promptly opened <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> their available firepower. As Farragut had hoped, however, their aim was poor, and his fleet suffered little significant damage. His own gunners' aim was no better, of course, and the forts likewise sustained little damage. The last three gunboats in the column were turned back. Itasca was disabled by a shot in her boilers and drifted out of action; the others (Pinola and Winona) turned back because dawn was breaking and not because of Rebel gun practice.|$|E
25|$|Seven F5s were observed—one each in Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky, {{three in}} Alabama {{and the final}} one which crossed through parts of Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky. 31 were killed in Brandenburg, Kentucky, and 28 died in Guin, Alabama. One tornado also {{occurred}} in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, killing nine and injuring 30 others there, all {{of them at the}} former Windsor Curling Club. During the peak of the outbreak, a staggering sixteen tornadoes were on the ground simultaneously. At one point forecasters in Indiana, frustrated because they could not keep <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> of the simultaneous tornado activity, put the entire state of Indiana under a blanket tornado warning. This was the first and only time in U.S. history that an entire state was under a tornado warning.|$|E
25|$|The {{dwelling}} {{is designed}} in the Federation Bungalow style and built predominantly of jarrah. In 1914 Dr James Battye in his Cyclopedia of Western Australia described the dwelling as follows:From the substantial foundation to the shingle roof {{every part of the}} structure is of jarrah, and after nearly twenty years - the house having been built in 1894 – every plank and beam and joist remain in as sound condition as when first they were cut to the contractor's design. Over twenty rooms are roofed beneath these jarrah shingles, and the interior is fitted <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> that art and comfort can suggest, while surrounding the house is a park of ten acres, tastefully laid out with lawns and flower-beds, and further beautified by the introduction of decorative statuary in bronze, collected by Mr McNeil on various trips to England and the Continent.|$|E

25|$|The city {{recovered}} from the Great Depression {{much more quickly than}} almost any other city in North America due to increased demand for nickel in the 1930s. Sudbury was the fastest-growing city and one of the wealthiest cities in Canada for most of the decade. Many of the city's social problems in the Great Depression era were not caused by unemployment or poverty, but due to the difficulty in keeping <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> of the new infrastructure demands created by rapid growth — for example, employed mineworkers sometimes ended up living in boarding houses or makeshift shanty towns, because demand for new housing was rising faster than supply. Between 1936 and 1941, the city was ordered into receivership by the Ontario Municipal Board. Another economic slowdown affected the city in 1937, but the city's fortunes rose again with wartime demands during the Second World War. The Frood Mine alone accounted for 40 percent of all the nickel used in Allied artillery production during the war. After the end of the war, Sudbury was in a good position to supply nickel to the United States government when it decided to stockpile non-Soviet supplies during the Cold War.|$|E

500|$|Oliver Sava of The A.V.

[...] Sava applauded {{the fact that the}} episode delves into [...] "the demented relationship that develops between Ice King and his new wife", noting that while [...] "the writers could have easily depicted Ice King in a more unsympathetic light, ... the tragedy of the episode is that Ice King genuinely cares about his new wife." [...] He was also complimentary towards the song, describing it as a [...] "suitably bizarre Adventure Time version of 'A Whole New World'".|$|E
