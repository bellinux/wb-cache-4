40|$|Self-renewal {{of human}} {{embryonic}} stem (hES) cells proceeds by a <b>unique</b> <b>abbreviated</b> cell cycle with a shortened G 1 phase and distinctions in molecular cell cycle regulatory parameters. In this study, we show that early lineage-commitment of pluripotent hES cells modifies cell cycle kinetics. Human ES cells acquire a lengthened G 1 within 72 h after lineage-programming is initiated, as reflected by loss of the pluripotency factor Oct 4 and alterations in nuclear morphology. In hES cells that maintain the pristine pluripotent state, we find that autocrine mechanisms contribute to sustaining the abbreviated cell cycle. Our data show that naive and mitotically synchronized pluripotent hES cells are competent to initiate two consecutive S phases {{in the absence of}} external growth factors. We conclude that short-term self-renewal of pluripotent hES cells occurs autonomously, in part due to secreted factors, and that pluripotency is functionally linked to the abbreviated hES cell cycle...|$|R
40|$|The Splanchnotrophidae is a {{small family}} of bizarre poecilostomatoid copepods which utilize marine opisthobranch gastropods, {{including}} nudibranchs and pteropods, as hosts. Species have traditionally been placed in this family primarily {{on the basis of}} host affiliation, largely neglecting the fundamental differences in morphology and paying virtually no attention to the concept of homology. Morphological analysis based on detailed re-examination of types and newly obtained material from existing museum collections revealed that the Splanchnotrophidae comprises genera drawn from three different families in addition to one non-copepodan taxon. The family Splanchnotrophidae is redefined to include only Splanchnotrophus Hancock and Norman, 1863, Ismaila Bergh, 1867, Lomanoticola Scott and Scott, 1895, and two new monotypic genera. All splanchnotrophids are endoparasites of nudibranch and sacoglossan opisthobranchs and show a vast size disparity between the sexes caused by hypermorphosis in the female. The genus Splanchnotrophus is restricted here to the European species and assumes a boreo-mediterranean distribution. It is redefined on the basis of redescriptions given for S. gracilis Norman and Hancock, 1863, and S. angulatus Hecht, 1893. The Western Australian species S. elysiae Jensen, 1990, and S. sacculatus O'Donoghue, 1924, are re-examined and placed in two new genera, Arthurius and Ceratosomicola, respectively. Re-examination of the mouthparts provided unambiguous evidence justifying formal placement of Briarella Bergh, 1876, in the Philoblennidae, a family thus far known only as ectoparasites from prosobranch gastropods in the Far East. The inadequately described genus Chondrocarpus Bassett-Smith, 1903, is provisionally placed as genus incertae sedis in this family. A new family Micrallectidae is proposed to accommodate Micrallecto Stock, 1971. The genus Nannallecto Stock, 1973, is regarded as a junior subjective synonym of the latter because the generic distinction was largely based on two glaring observational errors: the absence of maxillae in M. uncinata Stock, 1971, caused by imperfect removal of the parasite from the host, and the presence of a chelate leg 2 in N. fusii Stock, 1973, which in reality is a feature of the developing nauplii visible through the body wall of the brooding female. Previous interpretations of the mouthparts in Micrallecto were essentially unsound. Micrallectids are ectoparasites of gymnosome pteropods and display a <b>unique,</b> extremely <b>abbreviated</b> life cycle, involving lecithotrophic nauplii and highly paedomorphic ovoviviparous adults that attain sexual maturity at the metanaupliar stage. Inspection of pteropod collections in the Natural History Museum led to the discovery of the first male specimen providing conclusive evidence for the proposal of a new family. The Micrallectidae is placed in the Poecilostomatoida on the basis of antennary armature, mandibular palp morphology and mating posture. The genus Megallecto Gotto, 1986, is based on a head fragment of a hyperiid amphipod that was erroneously interpreted upside down and back to front. Its type species M. thirioti Gotto, 1986, is identified as a junior subjective synonym of Phrosina semilunata Risso, 1822, a widely distributed and very abundant hyperiid in the Atlantic...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} results of chemical research efforts directed in three areas: (1) the final design of an ultraviolet-visible absorption and emission matrix isolation apparatus is described, (2) by employing this apparatus, molecular scale interactions of the 1 : 1 metal-water adduct are investigated utilizing electronic absorption spectroscopy, and (3) molecular orbital and electronic state-to-state correlations are invoked to interpret the chemical reaction dynamics of the adducts along ground and excited potential energy surfaces. The final design of this matrix isolation apparatus incorporated <b>unique</b> features that <b>abbreviated</b> data acquisition time and obviated several experimental problems that have plagued previous matrix isolation studies. The investigations of the molecular interactions and reactions of the Group IIA metal atoms (Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba), the Group IIIA metal atoms (Al, Ga, In), and the Group IVA metal atoms (Si, Ge, Sn, Pb) with water molecules isolated in rare gas matrices at 15 K are reported. In most instances, the strength of the metal-water interaction is sufficiently strong to perturb significantly the electronic structure of the metal atom which results in a unique band structure for the adduct that is red-shifted from the metal atomic resonance transition. Selective photolysis studies contributed {{to a better understanding of}} the electronic structure of the adduct. Molecular orbital theory is invoked to interpret the nature of the ground and excited states of the metal-water adduct. By resorting to molecular orbital and electronic state correlation methods, the qualitative features of the metal-water interaction potential energy surfaces are derived which predicate the chemical reaction dynamics that, in turn, result in a fundamental understanding of relative reactivities, photochemical pathways, and chemiluminescent processes. In addition, this dissertation reports studies of the electronic structures of the Group IIIA metal suboxides (Al(, 2) O, Ga(, 2) O, In(, 2) O) in absorption and emission. Progressions in the symmetric stretching and bending modes for the ground and excited states are observed. Finally, previously undocumented electronic structures of several metal dimers (Al(, 2), Ba(, 2), Ge(, 2)) are reported and discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Essentially a re-styled Triumph Bonneville, the [...] "West Coast" [...] styled TSX was {{distinguished}} by its lowered chassis and 16 in rear wheel {{with the engine}} off-set in the frame to accommodate this. Other changes, whilst unique to the model, were cosmetic including stepped seat, black finished engine with polished fins, re-styled passenger grabrail, shortened front and rear painted mudguards, the latter having a black plastic extension for the larger UK vehicle numberplate, chromed shorty megaphone exhausts with the crossover pipe hidden between them under the bike and flowing thru 1.75" [...] pipes, Morris alloy wheels (then made by Performance Machine) and 'retro' stick on graphics outlined in the usual gold hand pinstriping. Paioli rear suspension units, with plastic top shrouds, were sited at a more acute angle further back on the swinging arm to lower the seat height. A slightly lower rise and wider USA style handlebar was fitted and chromed Lucas turn indicators returned {{in place of the}} black plastic ULO items that had replaced them on other Triumph models from 1981. A chromed wire mounted Lucas headlamp with sealed beam was changed to the Lucas H4 early in the production run. A Brembo rear brake master cylinder was fitted in place of the usual Automotive Products (AP) Lockheed item which remained for the front, as well as supplying both calipers. Dual front discs were an option. Whilst the 1982-1983 brochure showed Goodyear Eagle tyres fitted, an Avon Roadrunner rear and Speedmaster front tyre went on production models, the tyres' lettering picked out in white. Although the German magazine Motorad road-tested a kick start-only version, the kickstart was an optional extra on the production TSX. The standard TSX engine was a T140ES (electric start) [...] with two 32-mm Bing carburettors and electronic ignition. The engine was offset to accommodate the fatter rear tyre within the frame which also necessitated a <b>unique</b> swingarm and <b>abbreviated</b> chromed chainguard. The engine also benefitted from an updated crank with more careful machining; the result being greatly reduced vibration. The TSX fuel tank was a unique design for the model having only one Paioli left hand petrol tap situated ahead to accommodate the larger Bing carburettors. This tank also had a centralised filler hole with optional locking cap and a balance pipe situated {{on the front of the}} tank's underside.|$|R
