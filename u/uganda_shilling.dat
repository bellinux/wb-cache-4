40|$|A 180 -point daily {{exchange}} rate series of the <b>Uganda</b> <b>shilling</b> (UGX) and the United States dollar (USD) covering from 25 August 2014 to 20 February 2015 is analyzed by seasonal Box-Jenkins methods. A time-plot of the series shows an upward trend indicating a relative depreciation of the UGX. A seven-day differencing of the series yield a series that is adjudged stationary by the Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) Test. However, its correlogram contradicts a stationarity hypothesis. A non-seasonal differencing of this series produces a series adjudged as stationary and having an autocorrelation function that suggests two models, namely: a SARIMA(0, 1, 1) x(0, 1, 1) 7 and a SARIMA(0, 1, 1) x(1, 1, 1) 7. Diagnostic checking methods {{used to compare the}} two models reveal that the former model is the more adequate model. Hence it is proposed that the {{exchange rate}}s follow a SARIMA(0, 1, 1) x(0, 1, 1) 7 model. Forecasting might therefore be based on this model...|$|E
40|$|A 177 -point {{realization}} of daily exchange {{rates of the}} <b>Uganda</b> <b>shilling</b> (UGX) â€“ Nigerian naira (NGN) from 22 nd September, 2015 to 16 th March, 2016, is analyzed by Box-Jenkins methods. The original series being non-stationary is differenced seasonally i. e. on a seven-day basis. A further non-seasonal differencing is done to ensure seasonality. These differences of the seasonal differences of the series are modeled by seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) approach. The first 170 values are used for the modeling process and the remaining 7 are used for out-of-sample forecast goodness-of-fit test. By a new fitting algorithm, it is concluded that the time series follows the additive SARIMA (1, 1, 0) x(1, 1, 0) 7 model. Forecasts obtained for the daily rates from March 10 to March 16, 2016 agree so closely with the observed values that the calculated goodness-of-fit chi-square test statistic {{is far from being}} statistically significant with a p-value of more than 99 %. Daily exchange rates between the two currencies may be simulated or forecasted by the model. Ugandan shilling; Nigerian naira; foreign exchange rates; SARIMA models...|$|E

40|$|A {{financial}} {{analysis was performed}} to assess the performance of three acaricide-treatment groups of indigenous breeds (Zebu and Nganda) of cattle on a ranch in Luwero District, Uganda. The treatments were based on different frequencies: twice-a-week dipping, once-a-month dipping and no tick control. The objective was to evaluate the economic justification for intensive acaricide application for tick and tick-borne disease control in Uganda. Data were collected by monitoring cattle performance {{over a period of}} 34 months. Biological data collected included the number of cows {{at the beginning and end}} of the study, net starting liveweight, number of calves born, number of animals dying due to tick-borne diseases and other causes, number of animals sold or slaughtered and milk yield. Records of variable costs (acaricides, drugs, labour, etc.) and output prices were assembled and calculated by treatment group. Gross margin and marginal analysis were used in the {{financial analysis}}. The exchange rate in 1990 - 1993 was one US$ to 1200 <b>Uganda</b> <b>shillings.</b> The gross benefits obtained from animal sales, herd value and milk yield were <b>Uganda</b> <b>shillings</b> 1175, 1389 and 1311 per kg of net starting liveweight for animals dipped twice-a-week, once-a-month and not dipped, respectively. The variable costs were Ug. shs. 424, 390 and 360 per kg of net starting liveweight, respectively. Consequently, the gross margins were Ug. shs. 751, 999 and 951 per kg of net starting liveweight. Furthermore, the marginal rate of return (MRR) in changing from no tick control to once-a-month dipping was 160 %, while changing from no tick control to twice-a-week dipping was negative (- 313 %). The above results showed that the value of increased gains in production obtained from twice-a-week dipping strategy does not offset the costs of inputs for intensive dipping. Once-a-month dipping (strategic) therefore appears to be the most-profitable tick-control strategy for the farmer. The need to conduct further studies in different livestock- production systems and to rationalise future tick control policies is discussed...|$|R
50|$|The {{body of the}} {{deceased}} was brought back to Uganda on 28 May 2017(Sunday). A vigil was held {{at his home in}} Muyenga,Uganda that night.Ivan's body was then taken to Namirembe Cathedral on 29 May 2017 (Monday) for church prayers before he was be taken to Kayunga for burial.Ivan was buried on 30 May 2017(Tuesday) in his ancestral home in Kayunga, Uganda. When still alive, Ivan would throw parties where he would throw notes of South Africa Rands, <b>Uganda</b> <b>Shillings</b> and US Dollars to people. The same trick was used by the remaining Rich gang members while burying him. So, instead of throwing handfuls of dust into his grave {{as it is in the}} Christian tradition, the Rich gang members tossed of notes of South Africa Rands, <b>Uganda</b> <b>Shillings</b> and US Dollars and Champagne in his grave.Concerned citizens; Abey Mgugu and Gideon Tugume dragged A-Plus funeral management and Bank of Uganda to the High Court seeking orders that the body of late Ivan Ssemwanga should be exhumed and all the currency notes that were buried with him removed. They argued that the money was being misused since it's a legal tender. Therefore they wanted it to be removed and brought back for the purpose of fulfilling it's use. They continuously argued that the currency of Uganda and other nations like South Africa and the United States of America should be respected and not end up being buried.In response, the Bank of Uganda wrote a document stating that; it is no longer interested in retrieving the money buried in the grave as the money no longer serves its purpose. They stated that the money was mishandled but then it's likely to be defaced, soiled or damaged and so it will no longer serve the purpose for which it was intended.Further more, amendments were made to the Bank of Uganda Act because the previous one didn't state penalizing some one who defies paper money.|$|R
50|$|Ivan {{was born}} in Nakaliro, Kayunga District. He moved to South Africa for greener pastures, and it is alleged that Ivan worked as a ritualist in a local shrine in South Africa. He was helping rich South Africans to solve their {{problems}} by dumping {{them on the ground}} and giving them holy water that would wash their problems away. This helped Ivan accumulate his wealth and by the time of his death, he had made a fortune with multimillion Business Empire which included Schools (In South Africa), students’ hostels, and apartments among others. Ivan was christened the ‘modern father of Showbiz’ in Uganda because he gave a new look to the socialite scene. All the current socialites in Uganda learnt the game from Ivan. Ivan married Zari and they have three boys together. In 2011, the couple organised a traditional introduction ceremony which cost over a billion <b>Uganda</b> <b>shillings.</b> A few years later, the couple called it quits after Zari accused Ivan of domestic violence. Zari is currently married to a Tanzanian Musician called Diamond Platnumz.|$|R

Her campaign office was set ablaze at the time destroying property worth millions of <b>Uganda</b> <b>shillings</b> as she had petitioned the primary election results sighting irregularities. In the office were documents of evidence to support her petition, she said:This has been an intended act of terrorism. I am so saddened to see the mess that is here, this shocking incident took place at night.

My target is to see all people of Sheema, young or old, know how to use a computer, but it is a shame to find we have people who hate development. On failing to agree with her party in regard to the results of the party primaries, Atuhaire joined the parliamentary race as an independent and won in the general elections of 2016, becoming a member of the 10th Parliament for the Pearl of Africa representing Sheema District.|$|R
40|$|Katonga wetland {{which lies}} {{to the western}} part of Lake Victoria covers an area of 237. 4 km 2. Although the wetland is known to contain flora and fauna that support livelihoods, there has been lack of {{information}} on the economic value of these resources and their contribution to livelihoods particularly of the rural riparian communities. The objective {{of the study was to}} generate information on the vital wetland resources, the economic value and contribution of these resources to riparian community livelihoods. The study was carried out in Nkozi and Kituntu sub-counties in Mpigi District-Uganda; it covered six parishes through which the wetland runs and involved 120 respondents. The study established that resources in the wetland are collected for subsistence and direct commercial extraction. The most important resource derived from the wetland for subsistence use was water for rural domestic use with each household using an average of 188 l per day (23 l per person) and was estimated at an annual economic value of <b>Uganda</b> <b>shillings</b> (Ushs) 490, 191 (U $ 233. 4) per person per year. Fisheries were the most important commercial activities undertaken in these parts of the wetland involving 36 % of respondents collecting an average of 119 kg per week with an estimated annual value of Ushs. 3, 991, 367 (U $ 1, 900. 6) per person.

40|$|Lake Katwe {{located in}} Kasese district, is an {{explosion}} crater in western rift valley {{and is the}} largest of the eight explosion crater lakes in the Katwe-Kikorongo volcanic field, containing a renewable source of natural mineral salts. Salt is produced for 6 months of the year during the dry seasons. There are over 10, 000 mud-lined pans of varying sizes between an estimated 200 - 300 m 2 and 1 m depth. Currently, rudimentally methods based on solar evaporation and crystallization to produce raw salt crystals are used for salt extraction at the lake. These rudimentary methods used to exploit the resource make this endeavor unsustainable.   As a result, relatively small quantities of the product are realized and often times of poor quality; therefore, this research sought to devise sustainable practical guidelines, procedures or techniques that could address the aforementioned problems. A methodology was adopted to characterize the site weather conditions, a model to mimic the actual solar evaporation process, and an economic analysis to ascertain the economic viability of the process. A Davis Pro 2 weather station was used to monitor the weather conditions. The evaporation rate was also monitored by use of a standard class A evaporation pan. In the evaporimeter, the brine layer was very small and therefore the lumped heat capacity analysis was employed for the model calculations. The Net Present Value (NPV) and the Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR) methods were used to ascertain the economic availability of the process. Generally, there are four clear cut seasons annually; two wet seasons from May to June and October to January and two dry seasons from February to April and July to September respectively. With the relative humidity ranging from 36 % to 95 %, very intermittent wind regimes with speeds of up to 12 m/s whose direction varies considerably, an annual precipitation of 900 mm, evaporation rates of up to 2160 mm annually, and ambient temperatures varying from 24 °C to 38 °C coupled with an insolation of up to 965 W/m 2. The model predicted evaporation rates increasing with increasing brine temperatures. An economic analysis that examined the process for a period of three years yielded a BCR that is greater than one and an NPV of about 17 million <b>Uganda</b> <b>shillings</b> thus ascertaining the huge potential of this venture if more efficient expertise and technologies are sought...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 73 - 80). Drugs are {{an important}} factor of production in health care. They constitute a signiﬁcant proportion of health care expenditure in both developed and developing countries rendering financing of drugs an important health care concern. Previous {{studies have focused on}} health care ﬁnancing in general and less on drug financing specifically and more so in least developed countries. This study therefore aims to provide an overview of the drug-financing situation in Uganda demonstrating the flow of funds for drugs in the health sector. The study further investigates whether the available financial resources could be sustained over time and assesses ﬁnancial sustainability of resources for drugs in the public sector required to meet the drug component in the National Minimum Health Care Package. Data collection methods involved in-depth interviews with key informants in the relevant institutions and document reviews of financial records and other major relevant publications. The data obtained was analyzed using well-established methodologies. Financing mechanisms were analyzed using a framework consisting of aspects regarding viability, reliability and level of funding. The fund flows for drugs in the health sector were analyzed using the modified National Health Accounts methodology and finally financial sustainability was assessed using projections from the available ﬁnancial resources. The study findings reveal a mix of financing mechanisms from both the public and the private sector employed to make drugs available to the population. The largest source of drug funding is out-of-pocket expenditure by households followed by central government tax revenue including donor support. There has been a noted increase in drug funding in the public sector though this is not adequate to cover the quantified drug need in the country. The size of the market for drugs increased over the review period (2001 - 2004) with an estimated total drug expenditure of 210 billion <b>Uganda</b> <b>shillings.</b> The projections show that the available financial resources for drugs {{will not be able to}} cover the predicted drug requirement within the National Minimum Health Care Package more so with the introduction of drugs required to treat new diseases like HIV/AIDS and the change to more expensive treatments for endemic diseases like malaria. The study concludes with policy recommendations urging government's commitment to allocate more resources to health and consequently to drugs so that there is less reliance on donor funding. It recommends that more effective means of utilizing available resources by mobilization of domestic resources including out-of-pocket payments through better-designed and well-managed health insurance schemes...|$|R
40|$|Economic {{valuation}} of wetland ecosystem services enhances informed public decision making concerning sustainable {{utilization of the}} ecosystem. The valuation is particularly crucial where the economic values of wetlands need to be compared directly against the monetary value of alternative public investments. Burullus lake {{is one of the}} most vulnerable areas along the delta’s, it is the second largest of the Egyptian northern lakes along the Mediterranean coast declared by Prime ministerial decree 1444 in the year 1998, a protected area. In 1998 Burullus Lake was approved as a RAMSAR site in Egypt, this report aim to clarify the main terms and methodology used by several guidelines to valuate use and non use ecosystem services, two questionnaires were prepared to conduct a new field work for further information about local communities satisfaction toward the fish capture as a market price method and bird watching as a travel cost method. In Mara wetland, Tanzania, economic {{valuation of}} ES derived from the wetland remains limited despite the fact that the wetland has been expanding landward over the last five decades. This study reviewed different economic valuation tools used in estimating economic values of wetlands, their limitations and selected the appropriate methods applicable in the case of the Mara wetland. In this case, market price-based methods were used to estimate their values. Other provisioning ES such as water and pasture for livestock however, are not for sale. The monetary values of water and livestock’s pasture were estimated by group valuation method through an FGD consisting of 23 people utilizing the services. Water purification ES of the wetland though assessed in this study was not valued directly to avoid double counting of the service. The willingness to pay for the water provision captures both water quality and quantity. The current (2015 / 2016) annual total economic value of Mara wetland in terms of provisioning and water purification ES is TZS 39, 877, 804. 22 (USD 18, 453. 40) of which crop production contributes the highest (47 %) value of the TEV while thatching grass contributes the lowest (0. 1 %). The dinder park of Sudan was declared a National Park at 1935, as Biosphere reserve at 1979 and was designated as Wetland of International Importance (Ramsar site) in 2005. The economic evaluation methods are mainly by direct use and market prices. The Total Economic Value (TEV) produced as result is (92944. 22 USD) The economic importance of the wetlands is definite and this TEV is still limited if compared to the real benefits from the different Dinder wetland' ecosystems. In Nakivubo wetland, Uganda the direct use value of the main provisioning services of the Nakivubo wetland Local Communities (one household per hectare per year) is worth about 8, 951, 809. 11 <b>Uganda</b> <b>Shillings</b> ($ 14, 833. 88) ...|$|R
40|$|M. Comm. For {{twenty years}} Uganda {{suffered}} the disastrous {{consequences of a}} system of rule in which there were no limits to the exercise of power. During this period the country went through no less than seven different regimes, all of which ignored {{the rule of law and}} left people without a sense of personal security or power. Many Ugandans were forced into exile and those staying on withdrew from politics, leaving politicians to conduct their business without any accountability. The National Resistance Movement (NRM) Government, led by President Y oweri Museveni, came to power in early 1986. This brought an end to the political instability and economic decline, which had plagued the country hitherto. Under his leadership, the nation embarked on an ambitious economic recovery program, supported by the IMF, the World Bank, and other donors. The key elements of this successful program have been the restoration of fiscal and monetary discipline; the improvement of the incentive structure and investment climate for exports and other production activities; the rehabilitation of the country's social, economic and institutional infrastructure; and the promotion of increased savings and investment. The economic reforms implemented by the present government in Uganda since 1986, coupled with political stability, have contributed to economic growth rates averaging 6 % per annum in the last decade. This has made Uganda one of the fastest growing countries in Africa. Inflation is under control and has been maintained below 10 % per annum for the last four years. Most economic activities are fully liberalized and open to foreign investment. There are no restrictions to 100 % foreign ownership of investments and no barriers to remittance of dividends. <b>Uganda's</b> <b>shilling</b> is fully convertible and has remained stable over the last years. The foreign exchange market is now wholly liberalized following a move by government, effective July 1997 to liberalize capital account transactions. Uganda is now one of about only five countries in the whole of Africa that have no restrictions on capital amount transfers. Within Africa and the emerging markets, Uganda enjoys a high status with donors and lenders. For the future, it is important to ensure that economic policy does not ignore social expenditure or the poverty dimension. In addition, President Museveni himself has repeatedly stressed the importance of attracting more private investment to Uganda in order to replace the foreign aid which can only be regarded as temporary. Other sectors needing attention are industrialization and privatization. As a landlocked country, Uganda needs to look to markets among its immediate neighbours. The new strategy should further include development of more linkages between agriculture and industry. It also needs to respond to people's basic needs and small-scale industries must be developed further. Only thus can industrialization contribute to economic welfare and sustainable development in Uganda. Privatization also needs to be reconsidered. It has contributed to the country's record rate of economic growth of 7 - 8 per cent, but so far it has not increased employment opportunities at all significantly. Nor has it enlarged the number of Ugandan entrepreneurs. Poverty, too, has not been reduced so far by privatization. There remams substantial room for development in most sectors of the Ugandan economy, creating opportunities for further and increased foreign investment. These sectors include food processmg and packing, construction equipment and electrical power systems, telecommunications equipment and services, travel and tourism services, light manufacturing, household consumer goods, footwear, furniture and textile fabrics, mining, mining industry equipment, non-ferrous metals, marine fisheries products and agriculture, including traditional crops such as coffee, cotton, tea and tobacco, fruit and vegetable processing, edible oil production, staple food crops processing, flowers and livestock. The vehicles for the facilitation of foreign investment are in place, the investment climate is open and friendly towards foreign investors, with an established investment code and incentive regime, offering generous capital recovery terms, particularly for investors whose projects entail significant investment in plant and machinery and whose investments are medium to long term. Uganda offers a predictable environment having achieved macro-economic stability at a time when clouds of uncertainty rock many regions in the world...|$|R
