5|$|Marasmius funalis {{mushrooms}} leave a white spore print. The individual basidiospores are ellipsoidal, {{and measure}} 6.5 to 8 by 4 to 5micrometres (μm). They have thin cell walls, {{and they are}} smooth and colourless. The spores are inamyloid, meaning {{that they do not}} stain when they come into contact with iodine from Melzer's reagent or Lugol's solution. The spores are borne on club-shaped basidia measuring 20 to 25 by 4.5 to 7μm, with two spores per basidium. There are also club-shaped basidioles (<b>under-developed</b> basidia).|$|E

25|$|The army is only lightly equipped—possessing no armour, artillery, heavy weapons, anti-armour or {{anti-aircraft}} weapons. It is chronically {{short of}} equipment, maintaining {{just a few}} mortars, small arms and limited communications equipment.

This capability expands the choice of landing locations, {{and at the same}} time reduces the potential enemy impact on the logistics support operations.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of this depopulation, the island was left <b>under-developed</b> and {{isolated}} until the mid-20th century. The isolation kept many of the pre-Civil War buildings intact and, by the 1950s, enterprising developers began buying up large sections of the island and restoring them to create an upmarket destination for wealthy people in the Northeastern United States. This highly controlled development can be compared to less-regulated development in neighboring Martha's Vineyard, the development of which served as a model for what the Nantucket developers wanted to avoid.|$|E

25|$|Large {{areas of}} the Union-Miles Park area {{continued}} to be <b>under-developed</b> in the early 20th century. Hamilton Avenue was renamed Harvard Avenue in 1905, but the dirt road did not begin to be paved until 1914. Roads were so bad that when St. Catherine Church (at E. 93rd and St. Catherine Avenue) caught fire in March 1899, the poor condition of the roads prevented firefighting personnel from reaching it in time and the new church {{burned to the ground}} (and was rebuilt). Even as late as 1906, most of Union-Miles Park still consisted of fields and dirt roads.|$|E
25|$|Though modern neo-nazis often invoke National Socialist {{iconography}} {{on behalf}} of white nationalism, National Socialist Germany repudiated {{the idea of a}} unified white race, instead promoting Nordicism. In National Socialist propaganda, Eastern European Slavs were often referred to as Untermensch, and the relatively <b>under-developed</b> status of Eastern European countries such as Poland and the USSR were attributed to the racial inferiority of their inhabitants. Fascist Italy took the same view, and both of these nations justified their colonial ambitions in Eastern Europe on racist, anti-Slavic grounds. These nations were not alone in their view; there are numerous cases in the 20th century where some European ethnic groups labeled or treated other Europeans as members of another, inferior race.|$|E

25|$|The {{ramifications of}} the Cold War, {{specifically}} the American decision {{to maintain a}} large standing army {{for the first time}} in its history, led to concerns about whether such a large military structure could be effectively maintained by a liberal democracy. Samuel P. Huntington and Morris Janowitz published the seminal books on the subject which effectively brought civil-military relations into academia, particularly in political science and sociology. Despite the peculiarly American impetus for Huntington's and Janowitz's writing, their theoretical arguments are often used in the study of other national civil-military studies. However, in his book The Man on Horseback, Samuel E. Finer countered some of Huntington's arguments and assumptions, and offered a look into the civil-military relationships in the <b>under-developed</b> world. Finer observed that many governments do not have the administrative skills to efficiently govern which may open opportunities for military intervention—opportunities that are not as likely in more developed countries.|$|E
25|$|Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby went on {{sick leave}} on 10 June 1915, {{and did not}} return to 142 Brigade. He was {{replaced}} on 14 August, but on 7 September he was appointed to command a new brigade, 120th, in 40th Division, forming at Aldershot. This {{was one of the last}} of the 'Kitchener Army' divisions to be formed, and the standard of height for infantry soldiers had been lowered in order to encourage volunteers: some of these so-called 'bantams' were well-knit, hardy men, but many others, especially in 120th Bde, were <b>under-developed</b> and unfit. It was estimated that the four battalions in the brigade would provide enough fit men for only two serviceable battalions. To prevent the departure of the division to the Front being indefinitely postponed, the divisional commander asked for fresh units to be drafted in. Consequently, Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby had to carry out a complete reorganisation of his command in February 1916. Divisional training was then intensified and the division was warned for overseas service in May 1916.|$|E
25|$|The {{whole world}} {{is said to be}} filled with living beings. In all the three parts, there is the {{existence}} of very small living beings called nigoda. Nigoda are of two types: nitya-nigoda and Itara-nigoda. Nitya-nigoda are those which will reborn as nigoda throughout eternity where as Itara-nigoda will be reborn as other beings too. The mobile region of universe (Trasandi) is one Rajju wide, one Rajju broad and fourteen Rajju high. Within this, there are animals and plants everywhere where as Human beings are restricted to 2.5 continents of middle world. The beings inhabiting lower world are called Naraki (Hellish beings). Deva (roughly demi-gods) live in whole of the top and middle world and top three realms of lower world. Living beings are divided in fourteen classes (Jivasthana) : 1. fine beings with one sense. 2. Crude beings with one sense. 3. beings with two sense. 4. beings with three sense. 5. Beings with four sense. 6. beings with five sense without mind. 7. beings with five sense with a mind. These can be <b>under-developed</b> or developed which makes it a total of fourteen. Human beings get any form of existence and are the only ones which can attain salvation.|$|E
25|$|Young's career {{took another}} {{interesting}} twist in 2000 when the Australian cricket federation approached him for help. Fielding {{has long been}} an <b>under-developed</b> aspect of cricket, as teams have concentrated on developing bowlers and batsmen. The Australians, observing how fielding was a central part of baseball, decided to exploit an opportunity by having Young coach their players on catching, throwing and positioning. Young was appointed as an assistant coach up until 2005 when his contract was not renewed and instead moved back to Chicago to manage the Rockford Riverhawks. During the 2005 Ashes series the Australian teams fielding had slipped and lost the Ashes to England {{for the first time since}} 1987. John Buchanan then made the decision for Australia to have a full-time fielding coach and Young became speculated in the media as the first baseball coach to coach a national cricket team and announced he would like to finish his managerial career doing it. In January 2011, Young came out in support for the United States Youth Cricket Association, modeling the organization's apparel at a photo shoot on the banks of the Yarra River in Melbourne, only hours before the Aussies were to take on the English in a One Day International match. He is also the current fielding coach of the Indian Premier League team Kings XI Punjab.|$|E

Similar views were expressed after a special screening at L. V. Prasad residence but Chakrapani was confident of the film's success when he saw children clapping in response to Rama Rao's performance in comical sequences.

500|$|The episode has {{received}} mixed to positive reviews from television critics. Chris Carabott of IGN wrote that [...] "Further Instructions" [...] was [...] "an entertaining hour of television. The episode certainly offers {{its fair share}} of excitement, but as with any typical Lost episode we are presented with more questions than answers". Carabott also called it an improvement over the preceding episode, [...] "The Glass Ballerina." [...] Andrew Dignan of Slant Magazine expressed relief in having Locke [...] "back to the way we fondly remember him--as a wide-eyed, knife-wielding, face-smeared madman", but disliked his flashbacks, calling them a [...] "largely <b>under-developed</b> affair". Dignan was also pleased to have Hurley back at the camp and referred to him as [...] "someone [...] will keep the show grounded", but concluded his review by unhappily noting the sudden emergence of Nikki and Paulo as [...] "a colossal misjudgment on the producers' part" [...] and [...] "a dangerous precedent that bears keeping an eye on." ...|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} claimed that [...] "Squirrels {{are the only}} known albino mammal to survive {{successfully}} in the wild". In all albino mammals studied, the eye color is green, blue or red due to absence of eumelanin in the iris, and {{the centre of the}} retina is <b>under-developed</b> with a deficit of rod cells; the central ganglion cell density is approximately 25% below normal. [...] In nearly all mammals, the overwhelming majority of photoreceptors are rods rather than cones. Albinism specifically affects the rod cells, but the number and distribution of the cones is unaffected. [...] The retina of the squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) is unusual for mammals as it is rich in cones. [...] Central cell densities are less than 5% lower in albino squirrels than in pigmented individuals. [...] This relatively minor disruption to vision is thought to assist in the survivability of albino squirrels in the wild. [...] This is supported by observations that the behaviour of albinos in the wild, e.g. leaping from branch to branch, is similar to pigmented squirrels.|$|E
500|$|The Byrds {{returned}} to the recording studio with Melcher sporadically between October 1970 and early March 1971, in order to complete the follow-up to (Untitled), which would be released in June 1971 as Byrdmaniax. [...] Unfortunately, the grueling pace of the band's touring schedule at the time meant {{that they were not}} fully prepared for the sessions and as a result, much of the material they recorded was <b>under-developed.</b> [...] Following completion of the album recording sessions, the Byrds once again headed out on tour, leaving Melcher and engineer Chris Hinshaw to finish mixing the album in their absence. [...] Controversially, Melcher and Hinshaw elected to bring in arranger Paul Polena to assist in the overdubbing of strings, horns, and a gospel choir onto many of the songs, allegedly without the band's consent. [...] Drummer Gene Parsons recalled in a 1997 interview that when the band heard Melcher's additions they campaigned to have the album remixed and the orchestration removed but Columbia Records refused, citing budget restrictions, and the record was duly pressed up and released.|$|E
500|$|The season {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews, after two seasons {{that resulted in}} heavy critical acclaim. Following a positive outlook on the second season, Christopher Monfette of IGN Entertainment expressed disappointment during the third one, mainly due to the declining quality and lack of realism of the storylines. He noted {{a growing number of}} similarities between the season's arcs and the ones that are developed in soap operas, by stating that [...] "the line which separates primetime television from soap opera is oftentimes razor thin" [...] and admitting that, despite his considering the series [...] "the best drama", he freely admits that it requires some inherent suspension of disbelief, after it [...] "found itself mired in the annoying and absurd". Whereas Monfette acknowledged that the fans would consider the problem to have been a simple case of lazy writing, he noted that over-writing played a main role in the series becoming unexpectedly unrealistic. He also noted the senseless intrigues in the Derek/Meredith relationship, by stating that the season would not have achieved high ratings if a functional relationship had been introduced: [...] "The season generally opts to stall out for its vast majority, providing Meredith with some bizarrely <b>under-developed</b> sub-plot about depression and giving Derek a season's worth of reconsidering to do".|$|E
500|$|The {{characters}} {{introduced in}} XIII-2 received a mixed reception, with some praising their inclusion and others {{saying they were}} too weak. Ryan Clements felt that the characters {{seemed to have no}} clear focus, with the only driving force being the quest for Lightning. VanOrd thought the characters were good, but said that the game focused too much on Serah and Noel, rather than the more engaging characters of Lightning and Caius. Dale North of Destructoid was the most positive, finding the characters very well fleshed out, understandable and well-voiced by the cast. den Ouden thought that the characters alright and well voiced, but [...] " [...] flat when the actors [...] awkward dialogue to work with". Juba was extremely critical of the characters and their story, seeing the company taking the [...] "weakest" [...] characters and placing them center stage, while the [...] "best" [...] characters, such as Lighting and Fang, were relegated to the background. Parish was disappointed in the character's development, saying that Serah was never given any true power within the game's narrative, and that Noel was <b>under-developed</b> beyond his original premise, with the [...] "stronger" [...] characters from the original game being a noticeable loss. On top of this, he disliked how the two [...] "least liked" [...] characters from XIII (Serah and Hope) were given such large roles. Parkin was especially critical, saying the characters were [...] "irritating or forgettable, full of fuzzy or weak motivations and stuffed with tortuous, posturing dialogue". Despite this, he said that Serah's warmth endowed the game with a comforting atmosphere.|$|E
500|$|Former {{television}} {{columnist for}} The Star-Ledger Alan Sepinwall expressed his boredom on the focus given on Grey's relationships storylines while reviewing the second season's finale: [...] "On those occasions when Meredith's {{not involved in}} a plot about her love life, I do kind of like her, but those moments are so infrequent compared to her constant angsting over McDreamy -- not to mention all those seemingly unrelated storylines that always turn into a metaphor for that relationship -- that I really, really can't stand her." [...] During the show's third season, {{the development of the}} character received negative reviews, with Cristopher Monfette of IGN stating that her storyline has become [...] "some bizarrely <b>under-developed</b> sub-plot about depression and giving Derek a season's worth of reconsidering to do." [...] Also during the third season, Robert Rorke of the New York Post noted the decline in Meredith's role in the show, expressing disappointment: [...] "She used to be the queen of the romantic dilemmas, but lately, she's been a little dopey, what with the endless McDreamy soliloquies." [...] Similarly, Macleans.ca found their storyline in the fourth season overused, [...] "This whole 'Oh I need more time,' but 'Oh, I'm jealous if you look at someone else' angst was tired in the second season, frustrating in the third and now a total channel changer. The will-they-or-won't-they plot doesn't work because they've already {{been in and out of}} that relationship too many times. Meredith is a nag and McDreamy is henpecked." [...] On a more positive note, her relationship with Shepherd was included in AOL TV's [...] list of the [...] "Best TV Couples of All Time" [...] and in the same list by TV Guide.|$|E
500|$|The wing {{was ready}} for combat {{operations}} {{at the end of}} 1942 and was assigned responsibility for defending Darwin against Japanese air attacks. The bulk of the units departed Richmond in air, land and sea parties during January 1943, following an advance party that had set out on 31December. No.54 and No.452 Squadrons' air parties arrived at RAAF Station Darwin and Batchelor Airfield respectively on 17 January, and No.457 Squadron began to operate from Livingstone Airfield on 31January. No.452 Squadron subsequently moved to Strauss Airfield on 1February. The Darwin area had been attacked 50 times by the time No.1 Wing arrived. Conditions at Strauss and Livingstone were primitive, with these airfields comprising narrow dirt runways and tree-lined taxiways. The pilots were not familiar with operating from such <b>under-developed</b> airfields, and the squadrons at Strauss and Livingstone suffered a high accident rate during February and March 1943. The airmen also found the region's hot and humid climate to be oppressive. This {{was the first time that}} Spitfires had operated in a tropical environment, and the aircraft were found to have lesser performance than in other climatic conditions. The region's remoteness also contributed to supply difficulties, and No.1 Wing continually suffered from a shortage of spare parts for its Spitfires. Despite these limitations to Spitfire operations, the wing's arrival improved the morale of Allied military units near Darwin and allowed No. 77 Squadron to be transferred from Darwin to Milne Bay in New Guinea. No.1 Wing first saw combat on 6 February 1943 when a No. 54 Squadron Spitfire shot down a Mitsubishi Ki-46 [...] "Dinah" [...] reconnaissance aircraft near Darwin. Another Dinah overflew Darwin the next day but was not intercepted, and no further Japanese aircraft ventured into the area during the month.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{likened the}} episode to Seinfeld and Ellen; Tom Feran in The Plain Dealer wrote that it traded [...] "vaguely and less {{successfully}} on the hanging-out style of Seinfeld", and Ann Hodges of the Houston Chronicle called it [...] "the new Seinfeld wannabe, {{but it will}} never be as funny as Seinfeld. Even as Seinfeld is now, which isn't as funny as it used to be". Hodges criticized the [...] "stiflingly dull social circle" [...] as [...] "short to the point of painful in brainpower". Robert Bianco in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote that the [...] "constant comic bantering grows a little tired, just as it would if it ever actually happened in real life", and questioned why the six characters had so much free time to talk about dates. In the Los Angeles Daily News, Ray Richmond, who had also seen the following two episodes, called the cast a [...] "likeable, youth ensemble" [...] with [...] "good chemistry". He added that while Friends was [...] "one of the brighter comedies of the new season", the pilot was [...] "very weak". Diane Holloway for the Austin American-Statesman questioned Friends billing as a [...] "sophisticated comedy", writing, [...] "What's sophisticated about a guy who dreams his penis is a telephone?" [...] She called the scene where Monica discovers Paul's impotence was a lie the least funny part of the episode, though conceded that the episode as a whole did have some funny moments. [...] Robert P. Laurence wrote in The San Diego Union-Tribune that [...] "A lot happens, but you'll still get the feeling you've seen Friends before", calling it [...] "Seinfeld Plus Two. Or Ellen Plus Five." [...] In the Chicago Sun-Times, Ginny Holbert rated the episode three stars, and wrote [...] "The clever series [...] stars an appealing group of actors who are just a bit funnier and better-looking than your average friend" [...] but that Joey and Rachel's characteristics were <b>under-developed.</b>|$|E
500|$|The title {{character}} of Grey's Anatomy, Meredith, has received both overwhelmingly positive and weary feedback by critics along {{the course of}} the show, with the development of the character garnering praise from majority critics. Earlier reactions for Meredith were mixed; in a 2006 review, Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times dubbed to her as [...] "the heroine of Grey's Anatomy". A reviewer for BuddyTV praised the distinct uniqueness in the character calling Meredith an [...] "unconventional heroine" [...] adding that the character was, [...] "Neither black nor white but always...wait for it...many shades of grey. The reviewer and to add that even in her lighter moments, she has still been [...] "dark and twisty." [...] The sentiment was shared by Glenn Diaz who remarked, [...] "You gotta love Mer when she's gloomy." [...] When Pompeo did not receive a nomination 61st Primetime Emmy Awards, for her work as Meredith, Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times suggested that Pompeo, [...] "has worked very hard [...] to make Meredith Grey an interesting character", and should have received a nomination. IGN Monfette, less impressed by the character, criticized her storyline as [...] "some bizarrely <b>under-developed</b> sub-plot about depression and giving Derek a season's worth of reconsidering to do." [...] Robert Rorke of the New York Post was critical of Meredith's relationship with Derek Shepherd, writing: [...] "She used to be the queen of the romantic dilemmas, but lately, she's been a little dopey, what with the endless 'McDreamy' soliloquies." [...] The development of the character has received praise from critics. Reviewing {{the first part of the}} eighth season, TV Fanatic wrote: [...] "this season belongs to Meredith Grey. She is the heart and soul of the show and has been outstanding. This is a character that used to be so dark and twisty and has now grown into a more mature woman. Ellen Pompeo has been at the top of her game this season." [...] Rick Porter reviewing the episode How to Save a Life from the eleventh season for Zap2it wrote, [...] "Without Meredith, and without one of Pompeo's strongest performances in her long time on the show, [...] "How to Save a Life" [...] would have run the risk of coming across as a baldly manipulative death episode, the likes of which the show has done several times before. He added. [...] "How to Save a Life" [...] may not be the ideal Emmy-submission episode for Ellen Pompeo, considering Meredith is off screen for more than half of it. But it's among the best work she's ever done on the show." [...] Janalen Samson of BuddyTV lauded the Meredith's development throughout the series saying, [...] "When one considers how this character has grown over eleven seasons, it really is amazing. Kudos to Ellen Pompeo for her fine work. She's actually done the impossible, because I actually care what happens to Meredith Grey."
