40|$|The {{differential}} cross-sections {{are calculated}} for proton-proton and proton-antiproton elastic scattering using the phenomenological model {{based on the}} analytic parameterizations for global scattering parameters (total cross-section and ρ- parameter), crossing symmetry and derivative relations. We confront our model predictions with experimental data in wide range of energy and momentum transfer. The suggested method may be useful for PAX Program (GSI) {{as well as for}} high-energy experiments at RHIC and LHC. The elastic proton-proton and proton-antiproton interactions allow a <b>unique</b> <b>access</b> to a <b>number</b> of fundamental physics observables. Some important experimental pp and p¯p data are drastically different in the energy region of √ s < 50 GeV and become close each to other at higher energies approaching the asymptotical expectation. We have proposed earlier two analytical presentations for full set of helicity amplitudes for p¯p elastic scattering and have made predictions for t-dependences of some spin observables in first presentation [1]. In present paper we focus our attention on predictions for pp, p¯...|$|R
40|$|Polarized antiprotons {{produced}} by spin filtering with an internal polarized gas target {{provide access to}} a wealth of single – and double–spin observables, thereby opening a window to physics uniquely accessible with the HESR at FAIR. This includes a first measurement of the transversity distribution of the valence quarks in the proton, {{a test of the}} predicted opposite sign of the Sivers–function, related to the quark distribution inside a transversely polarized nucleon, in Drell–Yan (DY) as compared to semi–inclusive DIS, and a first measurement of the moduli and the relative phase of the time–like electric and magnetic form factors GE,M of the proton. In polarized and unpolarized p¯p elastic scattering open questions like the contribution from the odd charge–symmetry Landshoff–mechanism at large |t | and spin–effects in the extraction of the forward scattering amplitude at low |t | can be addressed. 1. Physics Case The polarized antiproton–proton interactions at the High Energy Storage Ring (HESR) at the future Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) will provide <b>unique</b> <b>access</b> to a <b>number</b> of new fundamental physics observables, which can be studied neither at other facilities nor at HESR without transverse polarization of protons and antiprotons. ∗ A short version of this report can be found in ref. 1...|$|R
