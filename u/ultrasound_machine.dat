2500|$|Patients {{frequently}} show improvement {{even when}} given a sham or [...] "fake" [...] treatment. Such intentionally inert placebo treatments {{can take many}} forms, such as a pill containing only sugar, a surgery where nothing efficacious is actually done (just an incision and sometimes some minor touching or handling of the underlying structures), or a medical device (such as an <b>ultrasound</b> <b>machine)</b> that is not actually turned on. Also, due to the body's natural healing ability and statistical effects such as regression to the mean, many patients will get better even when given no treatment at all. Thus, the relevant question when assessing a treatment is not [...] "does the treatment work?" [...] but [...] "does the treatment work better than a placebo treatment, or no treatment at all?" [...] As one early clinical trial researcher wrote, [...] "the first object of a therapeutic trial is to discover whether the patients who receive the treatment under investigation are cured more rapidly, more completely or more frequently, {{than they would have}} been without it." [...] More broadly, the aim of a clinical trial is to determine what treatments, delivered in what circumstances, to which patients, in what conditions, are the most effective.|$|E

50|$|A {{sound wave}} is {{typically}} {{produced by a}} piezoelectric transducer encased in a plastic housing. Strong, short electrical pulses from the <b>ultrasound</b> <b>machine</b> drive the transducer at the desired frequency. The frequencies can be anywhere between 1 and 18 MHz. Older technology transducers focused their beam with physical lenses. Newer technology transducers use phased array techniques to enable the <b>ultrasound</b> <b>machine</b> to change the direction and depth of focus.|$|E
5000|$|Home <b>ultrasound</b> <b>machines</b> {{operate within}} the range of {{frequencies}} of therapeutic ultrasound, as opposed to the more commonly known diagnostic ultrasound, or Diagnostic sonography. Typical diagnostic <b>ultrasound</b> <b>machines</b> operate in the frequency range of 2-18 megahertz, whereas home <b>ultrasound</b> <b>machines</b> and therapeutic <b>ultrasound</b> <b>machines</b> operate in the frequency range of [...]7-3.3 megahertz. Diagnostic sonography is typically used to create an audio [...] "image", such as during pregnancy to visualize the developing baby.|$|R

30|$|The major {{challenge}} to technology-focused curricular components generally lies with funding. Specific to focused ultrasonography, start-up costs include obtaining portable or handheld <b>ultrasound</b> <b>machines</b> and associated maintenance costs. Current models for portable <b>ultrasound</b> <b>machines</b> can range up to US$ 60, 000 per machine including service agreements and appropriate transducers. Handheld <b>ultrasound</b> <b>machines</b> {{may represent a}} drastically less expensive, although currently limited technologically option, with some machines ranging near US$ 10, 000 including service agreements. To limit equipment costs, this program utilized shared equipment with the medical center and relies upon clinical <b>ultrasound</b> <b>machines</b> for {{a large portion of}} the educational experience. Faculty time requirements were limited by designating a single faculty member as the ultrasound program director. Additional OSU COM faculty from departments with established ultrasound practices and experience were used to further enhance the program such as Emergency Medicine, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Radiology, Surgery, and Internal Medicine.|$|R
30|$|Point-of-care {{ultrasound}} {{is becoming}} an essential diagnostic skill for all physicians [9]. Anesthesiologists routinely use <b>ultrasound</b> <b>machines</b> for procedures such as catheter placement or nerve blocks, as well as transesophageal echocardiography for cardiac surgery. Thus, they are familiar with <b>ultrasound</b> <b>machines</b> and should therefore be able to improve patient care {{by the addition of}} diagnostic ultrasonography. Training to ensure competent use of this technology is thus of utmost importance [8, 9].|$|R

50|$|Portable {{ultrasound}} is a modality {{of medical}} ultrasonography that utilizes small and light devices, {{compared to the}} console style <b>ultrasound</b> <b>machines</b> that preceded them.

50|$|Portable <b>ultrasound</b> <b>machines</b> are {{typically}} used {{in situations where}} space is limited, mobility is important, or the scanning must {{be done in the}} field. OB/GYN doctors were the first to start using portable ultrasound systems as these could be brought bedside or were affordable enough to be purchased by a private practice. Currently portable <b>ultrasound</b> <b>machines</b> are used in Cardiac, Vascular, Radiology, Endocrinology, Pediatric and OB/GYN applications. In addition, EMS personnel from several countries including Germany, Italy, France, and the United States have used portable ultrasound evaluations in the field.|$|R

40|$|<b>Ultrasound</b> <b>machines</b> are {{frequently}} used by physiotherapists. Thus, {{it is imperative}} that machines are accurate for safe and effective treatments. This study aimed to examine the accuracy of therapeutic <b>ultrasound</b> <b>machines</b> in terms of power output and timing function, and to determine factors that relate to the degree of machine accuracy. An observational design was used. Sixty-four machines were sampled. Machines were tested at three power settings, two frequencies, and pulsed and continuous modes. Timers were assessed for 5 - and 10 -minute durations. <b>Ultrasound</b> <b>machines</b> were considered inaccurate if they deviated by more than Â± 20 % and timers if they deviated by Â± 10 %. Fifty-nine percent (291 / 492) of power tests were inaccurate, with 79 % of these producing less power output than depicted on the dial. Thirty-seven percent of timers were inaccurate, with mechanical timers more inaccurate than digital timers (p < 0. 05). Older <b>ultrasound</b> <b>machines</b> {{were more likely to be}} inaccurate (p < 0. 05). Length of time since machine calibration was also associated with machine inaccuracy at 3 MHz (p < 0. 05). There is a high level of power and timer inaccuracy in machines that may be related to machine age and frequency of calibration. This study highlights the need for therapists to be aware of the potential for machine inaccuracy and for stricter guidelines on machine calibration to be introduced...|$|R
