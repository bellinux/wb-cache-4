25|$|Public {{university}} {{schools have}} a long <b>history</b> <b>in</b> Portugal. They started in the Middle Ages, and like other European medieval universities at the time, they were founded by the monarchs under the authority and supervision of the Catholic Church. For many centuries {{there was only one}} university, the University of Coimbra, founded in 1290 in Lisbon. It was founded as a Studium Generale (Estudo Geral). Scientiae thesaurus mirabilis, the royal charter announcing the institution of the current University of Coimbra was dated 1 March of that year, although efforts had been made at least since 1288 to create this first <b>university</b> <b>studies</b> <b>in</b> Portugal. Throughout <b>history</b> it transferred between Coimbra and Lisbon several times, definitely settling in Coimbra during the 16th century (1537). The Colégio do Espírito Santo, a university college, was an old higher learning institution which operated between 1559 and 1759 in Évora, but it was shut down during the Marquis of Pombal government, because it was run by the Jesuits, and the marquis implemented strong secular policies. A new state-run university at Évora was founded in 1973 - the University of Évora. Within the scope of the Portuguese Empire, the Portuguese founded in 1792 the oldest engineering school of Latin America (the Real Academia de Artilharia, Fortificação e Desenho), as well as the oldest medical college of Asia (the Goa Medical College) in 1842.|$|R
40|$|Background: The great German surgeon Theodor Billroth and {{the imaginative}} and {{creative}} composer Johannes Brahms {{had a very}} close friendship centered on musical activities, that lasted for {{more than thirty years}} while they lived and worked in Zurich and Vienna, {{during the second half of}} the Nineteenth Century. Billroth, besides his all-consuming medical activities, had time to be a musical enthusiast who directed orchestras, played the violin in chamber music groups, and wrote musical criticism for newspapers. The common affection between these two creative giants is documented by their abundant and effusive correspondence, by the constant requests by Brahms of Billroth's opinions regarding his compositions, and by the positive and stimulating answers that Billroth gave to these requests. Billroth opened his house for musical evenings to play Brahms chamber compositions for the first time, and Brahms dedicated his two Opus 51 string quartets Nos. 1 and 2, known in the musical milieu as Billroth I and II, to his physician friend. Unfortunately, the close bonds between these two geniuses weakened towards the end of their lives as a result of Billroth's becoming intolerant to the lack of social refinements and gruff behavior of the composer. This baffling intolerance of Billroth to his friend Brahms can be better understood after reading Billroth's writings in his book The Medical Sciences in the German <b>Universities.</b> A <b>Study</b> <b>in</b> the <b>History</b> of Civilization. There Billroth expresses strong prejudices against potential medical students of humble social origins, such as those of Brahms, coupled to a primitive anti-Semitism...|$|R
40|$|Initially focused {{above all}} on the cases of Great Britain, the United States and Germany, the historiography of eugenics, {{starting}} from the early 90 s, has assumed a more open and varied comparative perspective. Nowadays, the general interpretative framework seems therefore extremely fresh and stimulating. First of all, eugenics no longer appears as a homogenous movement, coherent within itself and essentially reducible to the Anglo-Saxon matrix. Instead, it {{could be described as}} a “multiform archipelago,” composed of multiple national styles: the Scandinavian countries, Central and Eastern Europe, Latin America, but also China, India, and Japan are among the nations most recently studied. Secondly, on a theoretical level, next to Mendelism, which was dominant in the British and North American contexts, neo-Lamarckism has been identified as one of the constitutive elements of the eugenic discourse, above all in several nations, such as France, Russia and Brazil. In parallel, “Nordic” eugenics has been coupled with “Latin” eugenics, widespread in Catholic countries such as Italy, France, Spain, Belgium and some Latin American nations. Thirdly, the definition of eugenics as a “pseudo-science” is being progressively substituted by an analysis that is more conscious of the relationships of eugenics to genetics and other scientific disciplines, such as demography, statistics and psychology. Finally, the myth of eugenics as an essentially reactionary field, mostly linked to sexist, racist, anti-Semitic and generally right-wing movements, has been replaced with an historically more mature evaluation, which is more knowledgeable about the fascination exercised by the eugenic thinking also in the left-wing milieu: from the first British feminists to German and Swedish social-democrats; from Spanish anarchists to French communists. In the context of this fertile comparative approach, the Italian case - notwithstanding its crucial importance, also from an international point of view, due to the role of Fascism and of the Catholic Church - has long been neglected, or has been <b>studied</b> <b>in</b> an incomplete manner, as a component of the fascist population policy or State racism. Based on previously unexplored archival documentation, this book offers a first general overview of the history of Italian eugenics, not limited to the decades of Fascist regime, but instead ranging {{from the beginning of the}} 1900 s to the first half of the 1970 s. A revised edition of the book was published in 2011 in English, under the title "Building the New Man.
