40|$|More than 50 % of <b>us</b> <b>now</b> <b>live</b> {{in cities}} while world {{population}} growth and urbanization continues unabated. There is an urgent need for policies that can address both the challenges and opportunities for sustainable development in urban settings. Within the past two decades, the idea of cities as fractal structures resulting from social and economic pro-cesses led to a transition in thinking of cities as machines to cities as organisms. Independently, the concept of ‘sustainable cities ’ had emerged earlier, with many successful implementations already underway. I propose to define a sustainable city as one able to feed and power itself {{as much as possible}} using land and energy efficiently with the least environmental pollution and impact on climate change, minimizing wastes and recycling and reconverting wastes into resources. Coherent fractal space-time structures are the key to a circular thermodynamics of organisms and sustain-able systems that achieves the state of minimum entropy production and dissipation that Ilya Prigogine had proposed as a conjecture. In this article, I explain how the principles of circular thermodynamics can be applied to sustainable cities...|$|E
40|$|Human {{beings are}} not simple to understand. Even if they were, most of <b>us</b> <b>now</b> <b>live</b> {{in a complex}} world that has allowed us to become {{detached}} from the natural patterns and drivers that have shaped humans and human consciousness over millennia of evolution. To try and understand how and why people behave {{the way they do}} in modern society requires us not just to understand the human side of the equation, but also to understand {{a great deal about the}} social context in which this behaviour occurs. The purpose of this paper is to set out a number of different perspectives that can be used to understand and interpret behaviour. It sets these out within a framework that demonstrates how each approach can contribute something valuable towards developing a broad view of behaviour. Within this paper the term ‘behaviour’ is used to refer simply to ‘what people do’ in the broadest terms. WARNING! The intention behind this paper is to act as a simple introduction to a range of theories that come from very distinct academic backgrounds, and to present them in a way that encourage policies to be developed that take them all into account. As a consequence, some of the more nuanced aspects of the theories are inevitably simplified. Therefore the reader is strongly encouraged to read the additional recommended literature to get a fuller understanding of each perspective...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the context}} of philosophy, a {{significant}} literature has accumulated that characterises the ostensible goals of education in socio-political terms. Much of this discussion has certainly centred {{on the work of}} political philosophers such as, John Rawls, whose commitment to liberalism has been translated educationally into a rich and varied discourse about the role played by schools in producing ‘good citizens’. Given the multicultural societies in which many of <b>us</b> <b>now</b> <b>live,</b> the question naturally arises as to exactly how tolerant a liberal society and the schools that express its values can be, not only in encouraging but in sustaining cultural and religious perspectives that directly or indirectly collide. Our aim in this chapter is to suggest that the debates that have arisen out of this context can be better understood, and made more amenable to resolution, when the covert values that shape and inform the more comprehensive educational epistemology of our schools are made explicit. When such values are made explicit, it will become clearer that the hope of authentic tolerance in a multicultural society cannot be achieved, if the very concept of knowledge that dominates the curriculum of our schools is driven at a deeper level by the preoccupation we have as a putatively ‘liberal culture’ with power. We shall argue here that power is, in its own right, a defining condition of social identity whose importance has not been sufficiently acknowledged within the current debate on multiculturalism and socio-religious tolerance. We shall now turn directly to the task we have set for ourselves...|$|E

40|$|The {{way we live}} is {{designed}} by the material world that we designed: a world we were born into and {{which is the only}} one we know (Fry 2008). However, {{it is now clear that}} in order to tackle unprecedented challenges, that very world and our interactions with it need to be questioned and radically redesigned, particularly in cities, where most of <b>us</b> <b>now</b> <b>live.</b> Utopian thinking in a time when urgent action is needed might seem indulgent, but I argue it is an effective way to explore new optimistic possibilities for our daily life (and go beyond what we are familiar with), generate ideas, and most importantly map values and priorities. In design, this is known as a divergent step of the process, in which we create choices; it sets the scene for subsequent convergent moments, in which choices are made. A key aspect of divergence is that disagreements and contradictions are allowed and brave ideas are encouraged. As a designer, I am interested in creating platforms enabling this involvement in envisioning divergent utopias. Some of the key issues I am exploring in my research include: what are the conditions that need to be in place, and “how much” should we design? Who are the possible actors in this process? How best to capture the conversations in order for these utopias to become generative tools? In this presentation I will show some examples of creative conversations in which participants reflect on the future by envisioning imaginary cities and communities. In describing each example I will unpick the processes and techniques that are used and what they can afford. Finally, I will outline how I am applying this approach and some of the principles described in the examples to ongoing activities of design research and practice...|$|E

40|$|Environmental {{planning}} typically enjoys {{success in}} natural settings, {{but the real}} challenge for developing sustainable cities is ensuring ecosystem integrity within urban contexts.

Low Impact Development: A Design Manual for Urban Areas introduces general audiences to designing landscapes for urban stormwater runoff—a primary source of watershed pollution.

40|$|On {{a global}} basis, it is {{estimated}} that the proportion of persons living in urban centers will increase to an unprecedented 65 % by the year 2030. The 2000 census shows that 80 % of the <b>US</b> population <b>now</b> <b>lives</b> in metropolitan areas, with 30 % in cities of 5 million or more. The environmental issues posed by such large population centers have profound impacts on public health beyond the city limits. The United Nations has estimated that by year 2015 there will be 26 “megacities ” (urban areas of 10 million inhabitants or more), most of them located in less industrialized nations. The factors causing the migration of masses of people from rural to urban areas are linked to environmental degradation. For example, desertification, deforestation, drought and salination of soils are common causes of human migration to cities in Asia and Africa. Deteriorating conditions are also linked to high human growth rates and the inability of local environmental systems to sustain them. However, the prevalence of pollution, together with inadequate sewer and sanitation infrastructure in urban areas, has led to environmental crises at a global scale. These changes in turn cause a cascade of factors that exacerbate disease emergence such as forest fragmentation, disease introduction, pollution and poverty. For example, recent research has shown that suburban sprawl, forest fragmentation and biodiversity loss are linked to Lyme disease risk in th...|$|R
50|$|When she {{was around}} 10, Fantcha joined the Flores do Mindelo {{carnival}} company. Like in Brazil, carnival {{is one of}} the most important social event in Mindelo. Gregorio Gonçalves, a.k.a. Ti Goy, at that time one of the most famous composers in the city, was the Flores do Mindelo music director. Soon he realized that this young shrill-voiced girl had a timbre that people would notice, a voice that would make the difference in the tough competition the carnival companies were indulged in. But, besides her voice and her look, Ti Goy detected in her a promising talent: he told her that she should become a singer and offered her some training lessons. Years later, Ti Goy introduced Fantcha to Cesária Évora; she also became a friend of Cesaria’s daughter Fernanda, who was Fantcha’s age. She started to visit Cesaria regularly and learned a lot from her: Ti Goy - who had previously trained Cesaria - taught her the rules of the rhythm while Cesaria taught her the vibes, the emotion, and the phrasing. Early 1988 - the same year Cesaria was recording an album that changed her destiny - Fantcha was in Lisbon, recording for Bana, the famous Capeverdean singer who lived in Portugal. That year, she went to the US, at the Massachusetts Capeverdean community’s invitation, for a concert series in the company of Cesaria Evora. Fantcha finally decided to stay in the <b>US</b> and <b>now</b> <b>lives</b> in New York.|$|R
