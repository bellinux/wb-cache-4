5|$|By 1880 {{the railway}} had six {{locomotives}} at its disposal. No. 1–2 were Class 14 that were intended as helping {{power to get}} trains <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steep</b> climb from Gudå to Storlien. No. 3–6 were Class 9 locomotives that would do the main haulage from Gudå into Trondheim. In 1883, NSB's other two Class 14 locomotives were transferred from the Smaalenene Line. The initial fleet consisted of 24 passenger and nine breaking cars, all from Skabo. The line featured the first bogie cars in the country, with a single entrance {{at the end of}} each car, instead of individual doors for each compartment. There were also 37 closed freight cars, 40 lumber cars, 20 boxcars, 100 flatcars and three milk cars. At first all trains were mixed freight and passenger.|$|E
5|$|The South Africans and Rhodesians {{launched}} a two-pronged {{assault on the}} German positions over the road to Bologna at 22:30 on 15 April 1945. The Cape Town Highlanders' advance <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steep</b> cliffs of Monte Sole was obstructed by a German minefield that guarded the peak. The Rhodesian officer commanding the leading platoon, Second Lieutenant GB Mollett, took a section of men and dashed through the minefield to the summit; for this he later received the Distinguished Service Order. Hand-to-hand fighting on Monte Sole continued until dawn, when the Germans withdrew. The Witwatersrand Rifles meanwhile took Monte Caprara. The Cape Town Highlanders took Monte Abelle late on 16 April, advancing under heavy artillery fire to the summit before clearing it of Germans. The regiment lost 31 killed and 76 wounded during these actions, including three Rhodesians killed and three wounded.|$|E
5|$|The third column, {{commanded}} by the experienced Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour, included 11battalions and 2 regiments of cavalry. The fourth, {{commanded by}} the dependable Friedrich Joseph, Count of Nauendorf, included the entire vanguard of Charles' corps and approached {{on the far}} Austrian left. The two larger columns, under Latour and Nauendorf, were to attack the French right wing in force, and to turn {{it so that the}} French army's back was to the Rhine. This was by far the most grueling of the proposed advances: they would approach the French uphill from them. Nauendorf divided his column into several smaller groups, and approached Kandern from several sides, <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steep</b> slopes, by coordinating contact between his column and Latour's, using Maximilian, Count of Merveldt's regiment as the link between them.|$|E

5|$|To {{the north}} of the fort, the Hessian right, {{commanded}} by Johann Rall, moved <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steep</b> hillside south of Spuyten Duyvil Creek against almost no resistance from the Americans. The Hessians began to bring up their artillery. At this point, the main body of Hessians, 4,000 men, under Knyphausen began to advance down the Post Road, which ran between Laurel Hill and the hill Rall was on. The Hessians crossed swampy land and when they approached the wooded hillside near the fort, they were fired upon by 250 riflemen of the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment under the command of Lt. Col. Moses Rawlings. Rawlings' men hid behind rocks and trees and darted from place to place to shoot at the Hessians as they tried to advance through the fallen trees and rocks. The first and second charges by the Hessians were repulsed by Rawlings' riflemen.|$|E
5|$|Nurmi {{was born}} in Turku, Finland, to {{carpenter}} Johan Fredrik Nurmi and his wife Matilda Wilhelmiina Laine. Nurmi's siblings, Siiri, Saara, Martti and Lahja, were born in 1898, 1902, 1905 and 1908, respectively. In 1903, the Nurmi family moved from Raunistula into a 40-square-meter apartment in central Turku, where Paavo Nurmi would live until 1932. The young Nurmi {{and his friends were}} inspired by the English long-distance runner Alfred Shrubb. They regularly ran or walked six kilometres (four miles) to swim in Ruissalo, and back, sometimes twice a day. By the age of eleven, Nurmi ran the 1500 metres in 5:02. Nurmi's father Johan died in 1910 and his sister Lahja a year later. The family struggled financially, renting out their kitchen to another family and living in a single room. Nurmi, a talented student, left school to work as an errand boy for a bakery. Although he stopped running actively, he got plenty of exercise pushing heavy carts <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steep</b> slopes in Turku. He later credited these climbs for strengthening his back and leg muscles.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} was to proceed {{in conjunction with}} the effort to capture Lae. As the Japanese garrison there was pressed by the 7th Division advancing from the Markham Valley and the 9th Division advancing along the coast from beaches east of the town, the Japanese hurriedly sought to reinforce Lae, moving about 6,000 troops from Salamaua to the south. Sensing an opportunity, in early September the 3rd Division began a drive north on Salamaua from Wau. On 31 August, the battalion joined the fighting, advancing around the right flank of the US 162nd Infantry Regiment and attacking the junction between the Lokanu and Scout Ridges. Over the course of 10 days of heavy fighting and hard going <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steep</b> slopes, it gained the position, securing it by 9 September. The battalion had lost 10 men killed and 47 wounded in the process, but had killed 107 Japanese. The following day, the 15th advanced towards Nuk Nuk as Japanese resistance crumbled. Hard-pressed, the Japanese garrison had begun to withdraw from Salamaua, completing the process just before the Allies entered the town on 11 September. The battalion's total casualties in the fighting around Salamaua between April and September numbered 11 killed and 50 wounded.|$|E

25|$|The high cliffs {{separating}} the two towns (then villages) were {{a major obstacle}} to economic development in the 19th century.

50|$|In the era {{of street}} trams, a tramway ran down Anerley Road, turning into Croydon Road. It joined the main tram network at West Croydon. In the early days a {{stationary}} engine was needed to haul trams <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steepest</b> part of Anerley Hill. Later models were able to climb unassisted, but special gearing was designed exclusively for this route. The tramway was replaced by trolley buses on route 654 which operated until 1959.|$|R

25|$|On 8 February Linzee ordered Juno and Fortitude under Captain William Young to bombard the Torra di Mortella {{from the}} sea while {{engineers}} under Lieutenant-Colonel John Moore hauled cannon <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steep</b> hills that overlooked the fortification. The British fire had little impact on the tower, and heated shot from the tower's two 18-pounder long guns ignited an ammunition box on board Fortitude which exploded, killing six sailors and wounding 56. Serious damage was done to the ship's mainmast and rigging and Young was forced to withdraw.|$|E

On October 4, 1862, Bartlett was promoted to the rank of brigadier general and assigned command of an infantry brigade in the VI Corps, which he led at the Battle of Fredericksburg. His appointment as a general expired in March 1863 without Congressional approval, but he was soon reappointed to the rank.|$|E
25|$|Lindsay Creek, a {{tributary}} of the Water of Leith, flows southwest down the long North East Valley at the northern end of Dunedin's urban area. This valley, lying between Pine Hill and Signal Hill, houses a residential suburb consisting of one main road with streets heading off it <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steep</b> hills on either side. One of these streets, Baldwin Street, is listed as the world's steepest street. The original North East Valley post office was located near the foot of Baldwin Street, but was relocated to the Gardens to be nearer the retail area.

25|$|In {{the heavily}} forested Caucasus and Pontic {{mountain}} ranges, various peoples still practice transhumance to varying degrees. During the relatively short summer, {{wind from the}} Black Sea brings moist air <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steep</b> valleys to supports fertile grasslands at altitudes up to 2,500 meters and a rich tundra at altitudes up to 3,500 meters. Traditionally, villages were divided in two, three or even four distinct settlements (one for each season) at different heights of a mountain slope. Much of this rural life {{came to an end}} {{during the first half of}} the 20th century, as the Kemalist and later Soviet governments tried to modernize the societies and stress urban development, rather than maintaining rural traditions.|$|E
25|$|The {{rickshaw}} {{was first}} imported from Japan in 1870 by an American businessman. They were a popular form of transport for many years, peaking {{at more than}} 7,000 {{in the early part}} of the 20th century. Rickshaws competed with sedan chairs for customers depending on their budget, haste, or terrain to be negotiated. The rickshaw was more rapid, but was not suited to climbing the steep terrain of Hong Kong Island. Before Hong Kong's Peak Tram went into service in 1888, wealthy residents of The Peak were carried on sedan chairs by coolies <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steep</b> paths to their residence, including former Governor Sir Richard MacDonnell's summer home, where they could take advantage of the cooler climate.|$|E
25|$|As more {{diesel-electric}} shunters {{were delivered}} during the 1950s {{the class was}} gradually transferred to less demanding work at Brighton and Tonbridge freight yards.

However, with the reorganisation of the BR regions in 1962, the Western section of the BR(SR) came {{under the control of the}} BR Western Region (BR(WR)).
