50|$|The first {{generation}} of Mirapoint Email Appliances were introduced in December 1998. The two models were the M100 and M1000, {{both of which were}} hardware identical. Their differences were in user count, with licensing done in software. Both platforms consisted of a 3U CPU unit, tied to a 3U high RAID array and a 3U rack mounted <b>UPS</b> (<b>uninterruptible</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply).</b> Both of these platforms initially ran Mirapoint MOS version 1.3, the first version of MOS to be released. In the initial release {{it was not possible to}} run without the UPS, later releases allowed a no UPS run state, using a license key.|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} is studied of <b>UPS</b> (<b>uninterruptible</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply)</b> control {{based on the}} voltage vector referred to a rotating reference frame with velocity corresponding to voltage pulsation and on voltage pulsation itself. To verify the feasibility of the control strategy, a SPICE-aided simulation is reported. The numerical results show that, with asymmetrical load, a pulsation ripple is present owing to the nonsinusoidal voltage waveforms. Nevertheless, the computer harmonic distortion values are acceptable...|$|E
50|$|Despite the new {{features}} and conveniences of IP telephones, some may have notable disadvantages compared to traditional telephones. Unless the IP telephone's components are backed <b>up</b> with an <b>uninterruptible</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> or other emergency power source, the phone ceases to function during a power outage as can occur during an emergency or disaster {{when the phone}} is most needed. Traditional phones connected to the older PSTN network do not experience that problem since they are powered by the telephone company's battery supply, which will continue to function {{even if there is}} a prolonged power outage. Another problem in Internet-based services is the lack of a fixed physical location, impacting the provisioning of emergency services such as police, fire or ambulance, should someone call for them. Unless the registered user updates the IP phone's physical address location after moving to a new residence, emergency services can be, and have been, dispatched to the wrong location.|$|R
50|$|An ANS 500/132 may be {{upgraded}} to an ANS 500/200 by installing the 200 MHz processor accessory card. It {{is possible to}} upgrade an ANS 500 to an ANS 700 or to downgrade an ANS 700 to an ANS 500 simply by exchanging the power back panel and PSU(s), but {{it is necessary to}} completely disassemble the base of the ANS in order to accomplish such an upgrade or downgrade. An ANS 700 has but one input power connection, even though it has dual, independent PSUs. However, an ANS 700 may be easily converted into a dual primary power configuration (independent primary power, possibly, and desirably, from different power panels, one possibly backed <b>up</b> by an <b>uninterruptible</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply)</b> by removing the IEC input power connector and physically and electrically connecting two input power cordsets, one to each of the redundant PSUs. However, this modification probably invalidates the machine's UL Listing. Nevertheless, such a modification would implement a true N+1 redundancy configuration.|$|R

The thesis {{is divided into two}} parts – theoretical and practical. Theoretical part deals with possibilities and ways of realizing an aggregation of safe <b>uninterruptible</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> Various devices that can appear in the section of a safe <b>uninterruptible</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> are listed and each device is characterized. Appliances that can be provided for by the sources of safe <b>uninterruptible</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> are mentioned as well. These appliances are listed in accordance with ČSN standard nr. 381120. The theoretical part concludes with new trends in realization of safe <b>uninterruptible</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies.</b> One of these sources is a clean source technology that can also be implemented in various ways. Practical part contains a suggestion of a safe <b>uninterruptible</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> for particular steam power plant. This suggested safe <b>uninterruptible</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> consists of rectifiers, batteries, inverters and a dieselgenerator.

40|$|The {{reliability}} {{improvement of}} no-break redundant electrical systems {{is the first}} aim of the proposed strategy. The failure of some <b>UPS</b> (<b>Uninterruptible</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Supply)</b> system {{may lead to the}} fire occurrence. The most used electrical configurations are presented and discussed in the paper. The innovation of the proposed method consists of taking into account the fire risk to improve the accuracy of wiring configuration and component’s failure rate. Thorough research on MTBF (Mean Time Between Failure) data has been performed for each wiring component and UPS. The fire risk is taken into account introducing an equivalent fire block in the Reliability Block Diagram scheme; it has an MTBF value calculated form yearly statistics of UPS fire events. The reliability of the most used UPS electrical configurations is evaluated by means of the RBD method. Different electrical systems have been investigated and compared based on MTBF. The importance of fire compartmentation between two or more UPS’ connected in parallel is proved here...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} occupational exposure to extremely low frequency (ELF) electric fields (EF) in office work. The background electric fields (n = 4) were 2 - 25 V/m and the highest electric field measured was 1000 V/m. Different devices found in the office environment were measured for EF exposure. Results included, e. g., (1) spot lamps: 400 V/m and 1000 V/m (from surface) and 30 V/m (distance 50 cm), (2) coffee maker: 10 - 20 V/m (from surface), (3) the transformer of a computer: 100 - 200 V/m (from surface), (4) the alternator of a cellular phone: 40 - 60 V/m, (5) a <b>UPS</b> (<b>uninterruptible</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply)</b> : 300 V/m (from surface) and 5 V/m (distance 1 m), (6) a PC table speaker: 250 V/m (from surface).

40|$|ISIS, {{situated}} at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) is the worlds most powerful pulsed neutron source. At {{the heart of the}} ISIS accelerator is a proton synchrotron which uses a ring of magnets connected in series and configured as a White Circuit [1]. The magnets are connected in series with capacitor banks so that they form a resonant circuit with a fundamental frequency of 50 Hz. The circuit allows the magnets to be fed with an AC current superimposed on a DC current. The AC is currently provided by a 1 MVA Motor-Alternator set and it is now proposed to replace this by a solid state <b>UPS</b> (<b>Uninterruptible</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Supply)</b> system. Tests on a smaller 80 kVA unit have shown {{that it is possible to}} control the magnet current with a modified UPS system in such a way that both the frequency, phase and output voltage are under the direct influence of the control system. This paper discusses the issues surrounding the upgrading of the AC supply to the main magnets with a view to improving the system reliability, improving magnet current stability and reducing the risk of mains failure...|$|E

40|$|Equipment {{maintenance}} {{is an essential}} part of any industrial plant. While fundamental, evaluating its impact quantitatively is a great challenge. Companies usually find it hard to obtain reliable financial support figures to justify the replacement of ageing equipment. Gassco AS identified this matter and provided the basis for this master thesis. This work’s objective is to provide a methodology that supports decision-making for maintenance management in a factual manner. Such feature was done after an exhaustive survey of current methods. Equipment reliability {{is an essential part}} of determining potential losses. A system’s losses due to unreliability depend on subcomponent interdependencies and individual failure rates. A model combining two existing ones was developed: EVA (Economic Value Added) and CoUr (Cost of Unreliability). A real case concerning the potential replacement of <b>UPS</b> (<b>Uninterruptible</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Supply)</b> units was used to test the suggested method. A tool based in a spreadsheet software was developed in able to easily use the recommended model for analysis purposes. The results obtained deemed such investment as non-justifiable financially. The proposed tool is a cornerstone towards better decision-making support. Nonetheless, it still has room for added robustness...|$|E

40|$|While {{planning}} a double-hole road tunnel with a length higher than one km, {{it is important}} {{to pay attention to the}} safety factor if an accident occurs. If there is a power outage, in order to avoid critical situations that could jeopardize the safety of the people present (facilitating the stream coming out from the tunnel and the arrival of the emergency personnel), it is really important to guarantee uninterrupted lighting of roadways, mandatory emergency lay-bys, and ways of escape. Uninterrupted service of the lighting systems supply must be guaranteed, in accordance with the current regulations, through the exertion of <b>UPS</b> (<b>Uninterruptible</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Supply)</b> and power units. During tunnel construction, such devices represent a cost that must be amortized. In this case study, which takes into consideration a section of a road tunnel characterized by emergency lay-bys and ways of escape, emergency and security lighting were planned and installation and management costs were evaluated. The goal of this research was the creation of a cash flow thanks to the energy generated by photovoltaic panels, in a way that the service life of the system (25 years) coincided with the amortization of the costs of the backup electrical equipment installation (complying with the regulations). The possibility of over-dimensioning the UPS and providing it with a proper photovoltaic panel surface (235 kW p) to generate and exchange electric energy with the grid was taken into consideration...|$|E

40|$|Fuel {{cells are}} {{expected}} {{to play an important}} role in future power generation. However, significant technical challenges remain and the commercial breakthrough of fuel cells is hindered by the high price of fuel cell components. As is well known, the fuel cells do not provide the robust source characteristics required to effectively follow the load during significant load steps and they have limited overload-handling capability. Further, the performance of the fuel cell is significantly degraded when the CO (Carbon Monoxide) is contained in the hydrogen fuel. In this thesis several new approaches to improve the performance of PEM based fuel cell power systems are discussed. In the first section an impedance model of the Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell Stack (PEMFCS) is first proposed. This equivalent circuit model of the fuel cell stack is derived by a frequency response analysis (FRA) technique to evaluate the effects of the ripple current generated by the power-conditioning unit. Experimental results are presented to show the effects of the ripple currents. In the second section, a fuel cell powered <b>UPS</b> (<b>Uninterruptible</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Supply)</b> system is proposed. In this approach, two PEM Fuel Cell modules along with suitable DC/DC and DC/AC power electronic converter modules are employed. A Supercapacitor module is also employed to compensate for instantaneous power fluctuations including overload and to overcome the slow dynamics of the fuel processor such as reformers. A complete design example for a 1 -kVA system is presented. In the third section, an advanced power converter topology is proposed to significantly improve the CO tolerance on PEM based fuel cell power systems. An additional two-stage dc-dc converter with a supercapacitor module is connected to the fuel cell to draw a low frequency (0. 5 Hz) pulsating current of the specific amplitude (20 - 30 [A]) from the fuel cell stack. CO on the catalyst surface can be electro-oxidized by using this technique, and thereby the CO tolerance of the system can be significantly improved. Simulation and experimental results show the validity and feasibility of the proposed scheme...|$|E
