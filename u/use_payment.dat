This encourages new drug users to enter the market. The novelty of the paper is the transmission mechanism for this effect, which is via the influence on market price...|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} wealth {{effects of a}} {{comprehensive}} sample of UK bidders offering contingent payment, or earnout, as consideration for their acquisitions. We show that bidders using earnout generate significantly higher announcement and post-acquisition value gains than bidders using non-earnout currencies (such as cash, stock exchange, or mixed payments). We construct a logistic model to predict when it is optimal for a bidder to offer earnout. We show that bidders offering earnout optimally enjoy significantly higher announcement and post-acquisition gains than bidders offering non-earnout currencies, consistent with our model of {{the choice of the}} optimal method of payment. Overall, we provide robust evidence that earnout is an effective payment mechanism to mitigate valuation risk to acquirers, and also enhances acquirer value during the announcement and post-acquisition periods.

The constructs were accuracy, control of pacing, convenience, efficiency, experience quality, future spending intentions, privacy, and satisfaction with the payment method. In all eight constructs, paying with technology was rated {{significantly higher than the}} traditional settlement approach. For all but efficiency, the respondents’ ratings were no different for smartphones and table-top tablets, but the tablets were rated as significantly more efficient than smartphones. While these ratings may be different for other restaurant segments (or other countries’ consumers), it appears that restaurant operators {{do not have to be}} concerned about guests’ acceptance of customer payment technologies.

Consumers make use of a distinctive feature of cash 2 ̆ 013 a glance into one 2 ̆ 019 s pocket provides a signal for both the remaining budget as well as the level of past expenses.

Survey data from Germany on consumers 2 ̆ 019 payment and withdrawal patterns are used to test these implications empirically. The data are consistent with all theoretical predictions: consumers who need to keep control over their remaining liquidity and who have elevated costs of information processing and storage will conduct a larger percentage of their payments using cash, hold fewer non-cash payment instruments, withdraw less often and hold larger cash balances than other consumers. Such consumers also <b>use</b> <b>payment</b> cards for some transactions; they switch to non-cash payment instruments only at higher transaction values than other consumers, however.

40|$|Abstract: The {{way people}} pay for goods and {{services}} is changing dramatically, but little data and research on consumer behavior and payment choice are publicly available. This paper describes the results of a survey of payment behavior and attitudes taken by Federal Reserve employees in 2004. Major contributions of the survey are that it asks: 1) why payment choices are made; 2) why individual payment behavior has changed; and 3) why individual‐specific payment characteristics matter for payment choice. Although the survey is not statistically representative of U. S. consumers, and thus may not provide accurate estimates of aggregate U. S. payment trends, many results are consistent with data from more representative payment surveys. For example, the data show a trend away from check‐ writing and toward electronic and emerging payment methods, but the choice of payment method depends on the type of payment, amount of payment, and other complex factors. Also, cost, convenience, and control over timing are the most important characteristics determining respondents’ adoption and use of payment methods. We find that payment characteristics vary widely across respondents, partly because of inherent heterogeneity but perhaps also because of measurement error, misperception, or inadequate information (lack of consumer education). Cross‐sectional evidence shows that respondents tend to <b>use</b> <b>payment</b> methods in a manner broadly consistent with their reported assessments of the payment characteristics...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} memorandum {{presents and}} discusses {{the results of}} the 12 th DNB-euro survey which was held in July 2001 among the Dutch public and business sector. The business community has energetically embarked upon preparing for the euro. Large scale and medium-sized enterprises have materialised 70 % of the necessary investments, small businesses around 50 %. Although quite a few things have yet to be done, the enterpreneurs themselves are confident on the outcome. Two thirds of Dutch society has faith in the euro as a successor to the guilder. Both satisfaction about the provision of information and the actual euro knowledge has improved considerably. This particularly holds for the knowledge of the correct duration of the dual fase, although this remains a subject of constant concern. Public and business community are rather worried whether a smooth transition from guilder to euro is feasible. They fear it's too complex an operation and foresee long cues at cash desks, counters and booking offices. To alleviate the burden of the euroconversion carried by retailers a growing number of Dutchmen is prepared to <b>use</b> <b>payment</b> cards. Finally, four out of five interviewees assume that the euroconversion will lead to veiled price increases, although so far neither the Consumentenbond nor the Nederlandsche Bank found facts or arguments to sustain their fear. euro; EMU; euro-conversion...|$|E

40|$|The Federal Reserve named {{improvements}} in the speed and security of the payment system as two of its policy initiatives for 2012 – 2016. Using new data from the 2013 Survey of Consumer Payment Choice (SCPC) and models from earlier research, we estimate how various aspects of speed and security influence consumers ’ decisions to adopt and <b>use</b> <b>payment</b> instruments. Some aspects of speed and security have a statistically significant influence on the adoption and use of selected payment instruments, {{but not as much}} as other characteristics of payment instruments. Using econometric models to simulate selected policies proposed by the Fed, we show that faster speed of payment deduction for Automatic Clearing House (ACH) transactions would slightly increase consumers ’ adoption of ACH-based payment methods, while enhanced security of payment cards would marginally increase the use of credit and debit cards. However, neither improvement is likely to increase consumer welfare much because consumer demand for payments is very inelastic with respect to speed and security. Our analysis focuses exclusively on consumers ’ behavior and does not include potential benefits of improvements to the payment system that would directly benefit businesses or financial institutions. In addition, preventing security breaches may preserve public confidence in the payment system, benefitting consumers even if they do not change their payment behavior...|$|E
40|$|The Federal Reserve Financial Services Strategic Plan for 2012 - 2016 {{specifies}} five main {{policy goals}} {{for the next few}} years. The second of its goals is to "Maintain public confidence in the end-to-end safety and security of clearing and settlement systems. " Indeed, in each annual Survey of Consumer Payment Choice (SCPC), respondents consistently rank security as the most important characteristic of payment methods. However, in regressions of consumer payment use, security is not as significant as other payment attributes, such as cost, convenience, or record keeping. We analyze that puzzle by looking closely at how consumers' assessments of payment method security relate to their actual payment behavior, including testing whether consumers are more likely to <b>use</b> <b>payment</b> methods they consider more secure. Econometric results show that concerns about security create an obstacle to the adoption of some of the bank account-based payments - debit cards, online banking bill pay, and bank account number payments - but once adopted, there is no significant effect of security rating on the use of those payment instruments. The reverse is found for more established payment methods - cash, checks, and credit cards: consumers' perception of security does not influence adoption, but it does affect their actual payment use. Policy simulation results show that security improvements applied to individual payment instruments would increase the adoption of some payments, but once those payment instruments were adopted, security improvements would have only a small effect on the use of those payments...|$|E
