5|$|Earlier, {{the first}} {{recorded}} use {{of toilet paper}} was made in 589 by the scholar-official Yan Zhitui (531–591), and in 851 an Arab Muslim traveler commented on how he believed the Tang era Chinese were not careful about cleanliness {{because they did not}} wash with water (as was his people's habit) when going to the bathroom; instead, he said, the Chinese simply <b>used</b> <b>paper</b> to wipe themselves.|$|E

25|$|Later the {{emphasis}} was on classical studies, dominated by Latin and Ancient History, and, for boys with sufficient ability, Classical Greek. From {{the latter part of}} the 19th century this curriculum has changed and broadened: for example, there are now more than 100 students of Chinese, which is a non-curriculum course. In the 1970s, there was just one school computer, in a small room attached to the science buildings. It <b>used</b> <b>paper</b> tape to store programs. Today, all boys must have laptop computers, and the school fibre-optic network connects all classrooms and all boys' bedrooms to the internet.|$|E

500|$|A {{sculptor}} for {{her entire}} artistic career, Oliver <b>used</b> <b>paper,</b> cane or fibreglass for her early works. However, she found [...] "fibreglass hazardous and paper too impermanent", {{and for most}} of her career she worked in metal. The metals used for her creations varied: the monumental Vine was fabricated in aluminium, as was the Brisbane sculpture Big Feathers; however most, such as Palm and the 2002 sculpture Lock, were crafted in copper. All 25 works included in the 1995 publication, Bronwyn Oliver: mnemonic chords, were made in copper, though a handful also utilised other materials such as bronze, lead or, in one case, fibreglass.|$|E
2500|$|After {{falling out}} of the public eye, Reavis became the subject of {{multiple}} magazine articles. [...] He was even featured in an official tour book. [...] Among the tales manufactured about the Baron of Arizona by these sources was that Reavis had <b>used</b> <b>paper</b> bearing the watermark of a Wisconsin paper mill that did not exist until the 1870 or 1880s. [...] Such tales discount the skill used by Reavis in the manufacture of his forgeries and the level of inspection they received before faults were eventually discovered.|$|E
2500|$|The Song {{conquered the}} city in 965 and used it for the {{introduction}} of the first widely <b>used</b> <b>paper</b> money in the world.

The Mongols sacked Chengdu in 1279 with a general slaughter that Horner estimated at over a million. During their Yuan dynasty, Marco Polo visited Chengdu and wrote about the Anshun Bridge or an earlier version of it.|$|E

2500|$|Around {{the year}} 1800, British {{inventor}} Thomas Wedgwood {{made the first}} known attempt to capture the image in a camera obscura {{by means of a}} light-sensitive substance. He <b>used</b> <b>paper</b> or white leather treated with silver nitrate. Although he succeeded in capturing the shadows of objects placed on the surface in direct sunlight, and even made shadow copies of paintings on glass, it was reported in 1802 that [...] "the images formed by means of a camera obscura have been found too faint to produce, in any moderate time, an effect upon the nitrate of silver." [...] The shadow images eventually darkened all over.|$|E
2500|$|Chasers <b>used</b> <b>paper</b> {{maps for}} {{navigation}} {{and some of}} those now using GPS still use these as a backup or for strategizing with other chasers. Foldable state maps can be used but are cumbersome due to the multitude of states needed and only show major roads. National atlases allow more detail and all states are contained in a single book, with AAA favored and Rand McNally followed by Michelin also used. The preferred atlases due to great detail in rural areas are the [...] "Roads of..." [...] series originally by Shearer Publishing, which first included Texas but expanded to other states such as Oklahoma and Colorado. Covering every state of the union are the DeLorme [...] "Atlas and Gazetteer" [...] series. DeLorme also produced early GPS receivers that connected to laptops and continues to be one of two major mapping software creators. DeLorme Street Atlas USA or Microsoft Streets & Trips are used by most chasers.|$|E
2500|$|Northwest Airlines' frequent-flyer program, WorldPerks, offered regular {{travelers}} {{the ability}} to obtain free tickets, First Class upgrades on flights, discounted membership for its airport lounges (WorldClubs), or other types of rewards. Customers could accumulate miles from actual flight segments flown or through Northwest's partners, such as car rental companies, hotels, credit cards, and other vendors. WorldPerks' elite tiers were Silver Elite, Gold Elite and Platinum elite which allowed for more mileage bonuses, priority wait lists and standby and other benefits. Over the years, some details of the program changed, such as introducing capacity controlled awards (only {{a certain number of}} seats allocated for free travel), expiration of account if no activity occurred in three years, requirement of a Saturday-night stay for domestic coach awards, waiving of capacity controls for awards but requiring double the amount of miles for redemption, and adding several partner airlines for mileage accumulation and award redemption. The original name of the WorldPerks program was the Northwest Orient Airlines Free Flight Plan, which began in 1981. The original program <b>used</b> <b>paper</b> coupons and gave credit for flight segments. Upon renaming the program to [...] "WorldPerks", a mileage-based system was used.|$|E

60|$|The new China {{that had}} arisen {{was a very}} {{different}} land from the old China of the Hans. A new and more vigorous literary school appeared, there was a great poetic revival; Buddhism had revolutionized philosophical and religious thought. There were great advances in artistic work, in technical skill and in all the amenities of life. Tea was first <b>used,</b> <b>paper</b> manufactured and wood-block printing began. Millions of people indeed were leading orderly, graceful and kindly lives in China during these centuries when the attenuated populations of Europe and Western Asia were living either in hovels, small walled cities or grim robber fortresses. While the mind of the west was black with theological obsessions, the mind of China was open and tolerant and enquiring.|$|E
