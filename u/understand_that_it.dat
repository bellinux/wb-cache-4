5|$|In {{the course}} of the {{deciphering}} of the Maya hieroglyphic script, scholars have come to <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a fully functioning writing system in which it was possible to express unambiguously any sentence of the spoken language. The system is of a type best classified as logosyllabic, in which symbols (glyphs or graphemes) can be used as either logograms or syllables. The script has a complete syllabary (although not all possible syllables have yet been identified), and a Maya scribe {{would have been able to}} write anything phonetically, syllable by syllable, using these symbols.|$|E

Kenyon {{and published by}} the Texas-based Foundation for Thought and Ethics (FTE). The textbook endorses the pseudoscientific concept of intelligent design—namely that life shows evidence of being designed by an intelligent agent which is not named specifically in the book, although proponents <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> refers to the Christian God.|$|E

The brother missionaries have been in the habit of picking out the prettiest women for themselves before they get here, and bringing on the ugly ones for us; hereafter you have to bring them all here before taking any of them, and let us all have a fair shake.|$|E

500|$|Though former Nickelodeon {{president}} Albie Hecht, a Jewish person himself, was dumbfounded by {{the accusation}} and deemed it absurd, Herb Scannell, {{president of the}} company in 1998, responded to the complaints and apologized to ADL. Scannell issued a statement promising that neither the strip nor the character would ever be published again. In the statement, he also noted, [...] "Unfortunately, the creators of the strip made an error in judgment by referencing the Kaddish. I agree with you that, however well-meaning, the use of the Kaddish in the comic strip was inappropriate." [...] Abraham H. Foxman, ADL National Director, responded via a press release in which they thanked Scannell for his speedy response and commended the company in general for understanding the issue at hand; Foxman concluded by saying, [...] "We appreciate Nickelodeon’s long record of creative and quality programming and <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was not their intention to offend." ...|$|E

[...] Mars, sarcastically, replied to rumors related to the use of special effects: [...] "A lot of people think this is a camera trick, but that is a heavy piano. Luckily, I’ve been doing about, you know, 800 to 967 push-ups every day, so it’s not a big deal, I can handle it." [...] Regardless, this achievement, Mars was cautious: [...] "The actions in this video serve as a metaphor, and should not be taken literally. I am aware of the power of visual media, and I encourage everyone who watches this video to <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is an artistic interpretation of the song, and not something to imitate".|$|E
500|$|A [...] fastball {{from the}} Cubs' Mike Montgomery on August 11, 2016, struck Holliday {{on the right}} thumb, {{fracturing}} it. [...] The Cardinals placed him on the DL. [...] Presented with the option to either allow the thumb to heal naturally or with surgery, Holliday elected surgery as that would have potentially allowed him to return before season's end. [...] He encountered multiple delays in recovery. [...] Having been informed {{in the final days}} of the 2016 season that the Cardinals would not pick up the option for 2017 worth $17 million, he was activated from the DL − although his thumb was still fractured − in time for the September 30 game against Pittsburgh. [...] He hit his first career pinch-hit home run in that game and 20th of the season. [...] Holliday released a statement: [...] "While I'm disappointed this could be it here in St. Louis, I <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> might be time to move on." [...] While his batting average had dropped to a career-low [...]246, Holliday was optimistic about a rebound. [...] Because he produced the third-highest exit velocity at [...] of all hitters with at least 100 batted balls in 2016, he concluded that to [...] "have my misses be more in the air than on the ground, my numbers could really get back toward where they have been my whole career." ...|$|E

500|$|Although it wagered only $947 on the clue, Watson was {{the only}} {{contestant}} to miss the Final Jeopardy! response in the category U.S. CITIES ("Its largest airport was named for a World War II hero; its second largest, for a World War II battle"). Rutter and Jennings gave the correct response of Chicago, but Watson's response was [...] "What is Toronto?????" [...] Ferrucci offered reasons why Watson would appear to have guessed a Canadian city: categories only weakly suggest the type of response desired, the phrase [...] "U.S. city" [...] did {{not appear in the}} question, there are cities named Toronto in the U.S., and Toronto in Ontario has an American League baseball team. Dr. Chris Welty, who also worked on Watson, suggested that {{it may not have been}} able to correctly parse the second part of the clue, [...] "its second largest, for a World War II battle" [...] (which was not a standalone clause despite it following a semicolon, and required context to <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was referring to a second-largest airport). Eric Nyberg, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and a member of the development team, stated that the error occurred because Watson does not possess the comparative knowledge to discard that potential response as not viable. Although not displayed to the audience as with non-Final Jeopardy! questions, Watson's second choice was Chicago. Both Toronto and Chicago were well below Watson's confidence threshold, at 14% and 11% respectively. (This lack of confidence was the reason for the multiple question marks in Watson's response.) ...|$|E
500|$|A {{significant}} {{moment in}} the character's story came when Clark decided to play football in season four, providing conflict {{between him and his}} father. Writer Darren Swimmer refers to this moment as a [...] "... callback to ..." [...] in season one. To him, when Clark defies Jonathan and joins the team anyway, it signified the moment where Jonathan finally decided that he can trust Clark to not hurt anyone. Writer Todd Slavkin viewed it as Clark finally emerging from his father's shadow. Two more significant moments came during the following season. First, Clark lost his powers when he failed to return to Jor-El to finish his training; leaving him human and vulnerable. According to Welling, [...] "... learned {{a little bit more about}} what it's like to be human, physically. Emotionally, he's pretty close to trying to <b>understand</b> <b>that.</b> <b>It</b> added more weight to his abilities once he got them back, and it made him realize his responsibilities for what he has." [...] The second moment came in the show's 100th episode, with the death of Clark's adoptive father. The decision to kill Jonathan was made so that Clark could finally step into his destiny, allowing Clark the boy to become Clark the man, as explained by Gough. In order to do that he needed his mentor to die, so that no one would buffer him from the world any longer. Welling saw the series' 100th episode as the chance for his character to evolve and grow. John Schneider saw the same catalyst for Clark's evolution. According to Schneider, Jonathan's death inspired Clark to make the move toward his eventual destiny. Jonathan provided such an example of sacrifice that it leaves a void in Clark. To fill that void Clark would have to become Superman. It was Schneider's contention that had Jonathan not been the man he was, when the time came that the world needed Superman, Clark would have been unable to take on that persona, because he would not realize that the world needed him.|$|E
2500|$|When I have {{a mental}} {{image of a}} triangle, for example, I don't just <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is a figure bounded by three lines; I also [...] "look at" [...] the lines {{as though they were}} present to my mind's eye. [...] And this is what I call having a mental image. When I want to think of a chiliagon, I <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is a figure with a {{thousand}} sides as well as I understand that a triangle is a figure with three, but I can't imagine its sides or [...] "look" [...] at them as though they were present (...) Thus I observe that a special effort of mind is necessary to the act of imagination, which is not required to conceiving or understanding (ad intelligendum); and this special exertion of mind clearly shows the difference between imagination and pure intellection (imaginatio et intellectio pura).

Nikola Kesarovski played with this idea in writing about a robot that could kill a human being because it did not <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a robot, and therefore did not apply the Laws of Robotics to its actions.|$|E
