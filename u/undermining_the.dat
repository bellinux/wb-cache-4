5|$|Early Dutch missionaries faced strong {{opposition}} among Torajans, {{especially among the}} elite, because the abolition of their profitable slave trade had angered them. Some Torajans were forcibly relocated to the lowlands by the Dutch, {{where they could be}} more easily controlled. Taxes were kept high, <b>undermining</b> <b>the</b> wealth of the elites. Ultimately, the Dutch influence did not subdue Torajan culture, and only a few Torajans were converted. In 1950, only 10% of the population had converted to Christianity.|$|E
5|$|In 1282, Michael Palaeologus {{died and}} his son Andronicus II took power. The death of the old Byzantine Emperor came as a relief for the society at large; his policy of Latin {{appeasement}} to the Church in Rome, heavy taxation and military expenditure placed a severe burden on the people. As the Ottoman Turks began taking land from the Empire, they were seen as liberators of Anatolians and many soon converted to Islam <b>undermining</b> <b>the</b> Byzantine's Orthodox power base.|$|E

5|$|Signals {{are given}} in {{contexts}} such as mate selection by females, which subjects the advertising males' signals to selective pressure. Signals thus evolve because they modify the behaviour of the receiver to benefit the signaller. Signals may be honest, conveying information which usefully increases the fitness of the receiver, or dishonest. An individual can cheat by giving a dishonest signal, which might briefly benefit that signaller, {{at the risk of}} <b>undermining</b> <b>the</b> signalling system for the whole population.|$|E
5|$|When a {{wave train}} strikes a wall at an oblique angle, the {{reflected}} wave train departs at the supplementary angle causing a cross-hatched wave interference pattern {{known as the}} clapotis gaufré ("waffled clapotis"). In this situation, the individual crests formed {{at the intersection of}} the incident and reflected wave train crests move parallel to the structure. This wave motion, when combined with the resultant vortices, can erode material from the seabed and transport it along the wall, <b>undermining</b> <b>the</b> structure until it fails.|$|E
5|$|After eight years, Soeprapto was honourably {{dismissed}} on 1 April 1959. {{the dismissal}} {{has been reported}} in several sources {{to be related to the}} acquittal of/dropping of charges against two foreigners, Junschlager and Schmidt, who had been accused of <b>undermining</b> <b>the</b> government; Junschlager died in prison, and Schmidt was freed on basis of time served in a high court decision which the prosecution did not appeal. As he had not been given prior warning he was unable to go to Merdeka Palace for the related formalities; at the time he was visiting his parents in Yogyakarta. His wife later noted that this led to him becoming disillusioned in President Sukarno's regime.|$|E

In the 1920s, trade teams dominated the Tour; cyclists such as Nicolas Frantz won the Tour with the Alcyon team. However, when Alcyon cyclist Maurice De Waele won the Tour in 1929 while ill, the organisers decided to introduce national teams the following year, to stop team tactics from <b>undermining</b> <b>the</b> race. Because of the Second World War, the Tour de France was suspended from 1940 to 1946.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} as {{prosecutor}} general, Soeprapto handled several high-profile cases, going after ministers and generals that outranked him politically. In 1953, he brought Sultan Hamid II, then a minister without portfolio, to trial for {{his involvement in the}} APRA Coup d'état; Hamid was sentenced to 10 years in prison by Supreme Court Justice Wirjono Prodjodikoro on 8 April 1953. Soeprapto also investigated Head of the Armed Forces Abdul Haris Nasution for his involvement in the affair. Other cases included the trials of revolutionary groups and foreigners accused of <b>undermining</b> <b>the</b> Indonesian government. He also oversaw an increasing number of prosecutors, drawn from Indonesian law schools.|$|E
5|$|Following World War I, Belgium possessed two {{colonies in}} Africa—the Belgian Congo, {{which it had}} {{controlled}} since its annexation of the Congo Free State in 1908, and Ruanda-Urundi, a former German colony that had been mandated to Belgium in 1924 by the League of Nations. The Belgian colonial military numbered 18,000 soldiers, {{making it one of}} the largest standing colonial armies in Africa at the time. The Congo underwent an economic boom in the 1920s and mines, plantations, and transportation networks were greatly developed. The Great Depression led to a collapse of commodity prices, <b>undermining</b> <b>the</b> colony's export-based economy and leading to a large reduction in income and employment. The only industry that expanded during the time period was centered around cotton production.|$|E

5|$|In May 1648, a Royalist {{rebellion}} {{broke out}} in Kent. There were fresh Parliamentary concerns about Henry Hastings and fears grew that he might reoccupy Ashby de la Zouch Castle. Lord Grey - a rival of the Hastings family in Leicestershire - {{was put in charge}} of the castle in August, which was used to hold Royalist prisoners, including James Hamilton, the Duke of Hamilton. Parliamentary worries about the security of the castle persisted and, possibly because of Henry's involvement in the recent rebellion, William Bainbrigg was ordered in November to slight the castle to put it beyond military use. He carried out his orders immediately, demolishing one side of the Great Tower and the Kitchen Tower, <b>undermining</b> <b>the</b> foundations and deploying gunpowder charges.|$|E
5|$|Kinship was agnatic, with descent counted {{only through}} the male line, helping to build the {{importance}} of surnames and clans. The increased {{power of the state}} and economic change eroded the power of these organisations, and this process would accelerate as the government responded to the threat of Jacobite risings by <b>undermining</b> <b>the</b> power of clan chiefs in the eighteenth century. The Reformation had a major impact on family life, changing the nature of baptism, marriage and burials, leading to a change in wider relationships, sacramental status and burial practices and placing a greater emphasis {{on the role of the}} father.|$|E
5|$|The 1961 {{season was}} typical on the field: Jim Brown {{led the league}} in rushing for the fifth {{straight}} season and the team ended with an 8–5–1 record. That left Cleveland two games out of a berth in the championship. During that year, however, players began to question Paul Brown's strict and often overbearing demeanor, while many challenged his control over the team's strategy. Milt Plum spoke out against Brown calling all the team's offensive plays, and Jim Brown said on a weekly radio broadcast that the coach's play-calling and handling of Plum were <b>undermining</b> <b>the</b> quarterback's confidence. They found a willing listener in Modell, a bachelor who was closer to their age than the coach's.|$|E

5|$|The Marian {{government}} {{produced a}} pamphlet with all six recantations plus {{the text of}} the speech Cranmer was to have made in the University Church. His subsequent withdrawal of his recantations was not mentioned, though what actually happened soon became common knowledge, <b>undermining</b> <b>the</b> effectiveness of Marian propaganda. Similarly, the Protestant party had difficulty in making use of the event, given Cranmer's recantations. The exiles' propaganda concentrated on publishing various specimens of his writings. Eventually John Foxe put Cranmer's story to effective use in 1559, and it features prominently in his Acts and Monuments when it was first printed in 1563.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} thought behind the Compilation would later inspire the {{creation}} of Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy, a subseries of games linked by a common mythos, and would use {{lessons learned from the}} Compilation production process. On an individual level, Before Crisiss popularity would inspire {{the creation of}} another mobile title within the Fabula Nova Crystallis subseries: originally titled Final Fantasy Agito XIII, it would later change platforms and be renamed Final Fantasy Type-0. The battle sequences in Advent Children also served as inspiration for Motomu Toriyama when creating the battle system for Final Fantasy XIII. Former staff members have blamed the Compilation, in conjunction with other extensions of titles like Final Fantasy X, for <b>undermining</b> <b>the</b> series' market presence and fan trust in the West.|$|E

In 1436 he attempted to regain one of the major border fortresses still in English hands at Roxburgh, but the siege ended in a humiliating defeat. He was murdered by discontented council member Robert Graham and his co-conspirators near the Blackfriars church, Perth in 1437.|$|E

A Colorado attorney proposed that the seven states which fell within the river's basin (California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, Colorado and Wyoming) form an interstate compact, {{with the approval of}} Congress. Such compacts were authorized by Article I of the United States Constitution but had never been concluded among more than two states. In 1922, representatives of seven states met with then-Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover. Initial talks produced no result, but when the Supreme Court handed down the Wyoming v. Colorado decision <b>undermining</b> <b>the</b> claims of the upstream states, they became anxious to reach an agreement. The resulting Colorado River Compact was signed on November 24, 1922.|$|E

After resigning from the royal household, Purvis {{published}} two political satires aimed at <b>undermining</b> <b>the</b> image of the king and his prime minister, Walter M.

Purvis died in the following year, after going to the United States to seek medical attention for his health. According to popular legend, he was an expert player of the Portuguese machete or cavaquinho and was believed to be the inspiration for the name of the Hawaiian ukulele.|$|E
5|$|Following Nixon, the Democratic Party's state {{convention}} {{instituted a}} rule that only whites could vote in its primary elections; the Court unanimously upheld this rule as constitutional in Grovey v.

Allwright (1944), overruled Grovey, ruling that denying non-white voters a ballot in primary elections was a violation of the Fifteenth Amendment. In the last of the Texas primary cases, Terry v.
