As a contingency, he hires a hitman named Dennis to eliminate SpongeBob and Patrick. Squidward discovers {{the truth about}} Plankton stealing Neptune's crown and tries to alert Neptune. However, Plankton uses mind-controlling bucket helmets, disguised as souvenirs, to control Bikini Bottom's residents, including Squidward, and renames the city Planktopolis and exiles Mindy.|$|E

5|$|In human civilization, {{wind has}} {{inspired}} mythology, influenced {{the events of}} history, expanded the range of transport and warfare, and provided a power source for mechanical work, electricity and recreation. Wind powers the voyages of sailing ships across Earth's oceans. Hot air balloons use the wind to take short trips, and powered flight <b>uses</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> increase lift and reduce fuel consumption. Areas of wind shear caused by various weather phenomena can lead to dangerous situations for aircraft. When winds become strong, trees and man-made structures are damaged or destroyed.|$|E

5|$|In {{their first}} strike against the Trade Federation, Kael, Sykes, Ved, Lutin Hollis and Kol Kotha, a {{mercenary}} agent of Borvo's, destroy the communications satellite Comm 4. The satellite's destruction temporarily disables a Federation {{base on the}} planet, allowing the resistance to successfully attack it and destroy numerous droids and heavy equipment. During the fight, Sykes commandeers a Federation gunboat and <b>uses</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> liberate labor camps along the Andrevea River, escorting the freed prisoners to a rendezvous point among ruins to the north.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in {{the present}} timeline, Siddhant has rebuilt the {{computer}} after many years. He <b>uses</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> reveal his future and sees Krrish killing him. Siddhant then kills Kristian, thinking that he is Krrish. Krishna later follows Siddhant to his island lair. When Siddhant looks into the future again, he sees the same thing, and is shocked to see Krrish still alive and on his island.|$|E

5|$|A {{sequel to}} Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash, subtitled , was {{released}} by Wildstorm in 2009. Jason escapes {{from the bottom of}} Crystal Lake to resume his hunt for Ash, but is captured by the U.S. government. Freddy helps him escape and appoints him the general of his Deadite army, using the Necronomicon to heal his accumulated injuries and decomposition; it removes his natural deformities in the process. At the climax of the story, Jason battles his nemesis Tommy Jarvis and his great-niece Stephanie Kimble; Stephanie impales him before Tommy decapitates him with a shard of glass. Jason's soul is then absorbed by Freddy, who <b>uses</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> increase his own power.|$|E
5|$|About 30% of agrichemicals contain fluorine, {{most of them}} {{herbicides}} and fungicides with a few crop regulators. Fluorine substitution, usually of {{a single}} atom or at most a trifluoromethyl group, is a robust modification with effects analogous to fluorinated pharmaceuticals: increased biological stay time, membrane crossing, and altering of molecular recognition. Trifluralin is a prominent example, with large-scale use in the U.S. as a weedkiller, {{but it is a}} suspected carcinogen and has been banned in many European countries. Sodium monofluoroacetate (1080) is a mammalian poison in which two acetic acid hydrogens are replaced with fluorine and sodium; it disrupts cell metabolism by replacing acetate in the citric acid cycle. First synthesized in the late 19th century, it was recognized as an insecticide in the early 20th, and was later deployed in its current use. New Zealand, the largest consumer of 1080, <b>uses</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> protect kiwis from the invasive Australian common brushtail possum. Europe and the U.S. have banned 1080.|$|E
5|$|After {{finding the}} fifth and final Scroll, the Sky Scroll, Musashi discovers Thirstquencher's base, a {{floating}} ship known as the Soda Fountain. Musashi attacks the base and defeats the Sky Guardian. Thirstquencher's leader, Flatski, forces Musashi to give him Lumina {{in exchange for the}} Princess, and frees the Sky Crest. However, this unleashes the Wizard of Darkness, who was sealed within Brave Fencer Musashi's sword Lumina the entire time. It is also revealed by Jon that the original Brave Fencer Musashi sealed The Dark Wizard within the sword. Furthermore, it was Brave Fencer Musashi who entrusted the crests to the crest guardians to prevent The Dark Wizard's seal within Lumina from being broken. In effect, the present Musashi's quest merely aided The Dark Wizard's revival. Musashi recovers Lumina and <b>uses</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> defeat The Dark Wizard. After returning the Princess to Allucaneet Kingdom, Musashi takes Lumina to the place where he found it.|$|E

5|$|Childermass {{meanwhile}} eventually {{receives the}} message meant {{for him by}} Strange and <b>uses</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> break the enchantment over Lady Pole. Enraged by this, the gentleman with the thistledown hair intends to place a second deadly curse on Lady Pole, as Faerie tradition demands. En route, he murders Vinculus after they encounter him, with Stephen Black forced to watch. During these events, Norrell and Strange attempt a spell that would cause the nature forces of England {{to pay homage to}} John Uskglass. Not knowing his true name, they dedicate it to the 'nameless slave'. However, the two magicians' belief that this is Uskglass is mistaken, and instead the power is devoted to Stephen. He uses his momentary control of England to destroy the man with the thistledown hair, before Stephen, travelling through one of the newly opened Faerie roads, becomes the new king of the now blossoming Lost-Hope.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{takes place}} in real-time. Located {{at the bottom of}} the screen is a power bar, a gauge that determines the amount of damage done to an enemy when attacking. Swinging a weapon causes the gauge to empty and then quickly recharge, {{allowing}} that character to attack at full strength. The party wields eight different types of weaponry: sword, spear, bow, axe, boomerang, glove, whip, and javelin. All weapons can be upgraded eight times, and repeated use of a weapon increases its skill level to a maximum of eight, unlocking a new special attack with each level. Weapons are upgraded with Weapon Orbs, which are found in dungeons or earned by defeating certain bosses. The player takes each Orb to a blacksmith, located in most towns, who <b>uses</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> reforge one weapon.|$|E
5|$|Early in the Second Age of Middle-earth, elven smiths forge nine Rings of Power for mortal men, seven for the Dwarf-Lords, {{and three}} for the Elf-Kings. Soon after, the Dark Lord Sauron makes the One Ring, and <b>uses</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> attempt to conquer Middle-earth. Following the Last Alliance of Elves and Men's fall, the Ring is seized by Prince Isildur; and after Isildur {{was killed by}} orcs, the Ring lies {{at the bottom of}} the river Anduin for over 2,500 years. Over time, Sauron captures the Nine Rings and {{transforms}} their owners into the Ringwraiths. The One Ring is discovered by D√©agol, whose friend, Sm√©agol, kills him and takes the Ring for himself. The Ring twists his body and mind, and he becomes the creature Gollum (Peter Woodthorpe). Hundreds of years later, Bilbo Baggins (Norman Bird) finds the Ring in Gollum's cave and takes it back to the Shire.|$|E

5|$|Ellen {{attempts}} to flee but is severely beaten by the possessed Bruce, who throws {{her around the}} cabin. While being strangled, Ellen picks up Bruce's mutilated hand which is still holding the dagger found from before, and she <b>uses</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> stab Bruce. A large amount of blood is expended by Bruce, who lies motionless for a moment, only to then continue his assault on Ellen. Ellen mutilates Bruce's body even further with an axe, chopping off nearly every limb from the writhing body. Severely disturbed by the things she has witnessed, Ellen rocks back and forth muttering to herself. The corpse of Scotty suddenly springs up, before turning towards the oblivious Ellen, ready to attack. The screen then cuts to black, leaving the fate of Ellen ambiguous.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his defeat}} in Sonic Colors, Doctor Eggman is left {{stranded}} {{in outer space}} with his robot henchmen Orbot and Cubot. A mysterious time-traveling entity known as the Time Eater appears; Eggman, realizing its potential, <b>uses</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> {{go back in time}} and team up with his past ("Classic") self. The two convert it to a robot to erase their past defeats from history. The Time Eater proceeds to attack Classic Sonic as he travels through Green Hill {{at the beginning of the}} original Sonic the Hedgehog, and interrupts a birthday celebration being held for the present ("Modern") Sonic by his friends, scattering them. Modern Sonic awakens in White Space and rescues Tails after traveling through Green Hill.|$|E
5|$|Harry and Hermione {{continue}} the quest, discovering more about Dumbledore's past, including {{the death of}} Dumbledore's younger sister and his connection to the dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald. They travel to Godric's Hollow, Harry's birthplace and the place where his parents died, and meet the elderly magical historian Bathilda Bagshot, but she {{turns out to be}} Nagini in disguise, awaiting their arrival. The snake attacks Harry and again they barely escape, but Harry's wand is destroyed. Their luck finally appears to turn in the Forest of Dean. A mysterious silver doe Patronus appears and guides Harry to an icy pond containing the Sword of Hogwarts co-founder Godric Gryffindor, one of the few objects able to destroy Horcruxes. During Harry's attempt to recover the sword, the Horcrux attempts to kill him. He is saved by Ron, who was guided back by the Deluminator, and they realise Dumbledore's gifts may be meaningful. Ron takes the sword and <b>uses</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> destroy the locket.|$|E

5|$|Homeworld is a {{real-time}} strategy {{video game}} developed by Relic Entertainment {{and published by}} Sierra Studios on September 28, 1999, for Microsoft Windows. Set in space, the science fiction game follows the Kushan exiles of the planet Kharak after their home planet is destroyed by the Taiidan Empire in retaliation for developing hyperspace jump technology. The survivors journey with their spacecraft-constructing mothership to reclaim their ancient homeworld of Hiigara from the Taiidan, encountering a variety of pirates, mercenaries, traders, and rebels along the way. In each of the game's levels, the player gathers resources, builds a fleet, and <b>uses</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> destroy enemy ships and accomplish mission objectives. The player's fleet carries over between levels, and can travel in a fully three-dimensional space within each level rather than being limited to a two-dimensional plane.|$|E
5|$|In a subplot, Bart and Lisa {{stay at the}} Springfield Retirement Castle with Grandpa, {{and they}} {{discover}} a metal detector in his closet. While Bart <b>uses</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> look for pirate treasure, they uncover an alternate ending to Casablanca. After playing the scene on a projector screen {{it turns out to}} be a very sanitized and typical Hollywood happy end, where Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman marry in the end. Bart, Lisa and Granpa all like it but one of the spectators, The Old Jewish Man, reveals that he was once a studio executive and actually tried to include this happy ending to the film. Ashamed and disgruntled, he pays Bart and Lisa to re-bury the film reel, giving them another film reel to bury along with it, titled It's A Wonderful Life (Killing Spree Ending).|$|E
5|$|John pleads with General Ashdown {{to delay}} the {{offensive}} so he can formulate a plan to extract the human captives, but Ashdown refuses and relieves John of his command. However, the Resistance disobeys Ashdown's orders and instead, await John's signal. Marcus enters the base, interfaces with the computer, and disables perimeter defenses so that Connor can infiltrate the cellblock and release human prisoners. Wright learns from Skynet (which assumes the form of Dr. Kogan on a screen), that he was created and built from the original Wright's corpse to lure John to the base; when the Resistance launches its attack, John will be killed, achieving the goal that Skynet had failed to accomplish in the past. The hidden signal that the Resistance received earlier is revealed {{to have been a}} ruse, and Skynet <b>uses</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> track down and destroy the command submarine with the Resistance's leaders aboard.|$|E
