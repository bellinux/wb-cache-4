25|$|The Gates of Doom pulsate {{with green}} mist as Indiana Jones struggles {{to keep the}} doors closed. Jones, {{speaking}} in Japanese, scolds the tourists for looking {{into the eyes of}} the Crystal Skull and instructs them to proceed <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left. The triumphant musical theme from Raiders of the Lost Ark is heard as the transport accelerates up the flight of stairs.|$|E
25|$|The {{transport}} momentarily {{appears to}} head toward an exit, {{before making a}} sharp turn into a large crumbling corridor. Lightning flashes along the walls, illuminating large cobra statues overhead as the transport continues forward. The Gates of Doom pulsate with green mist and an audio-animatronic Indiana Jones struggles to keep the doors closed. Jones scolds the tourists for looking into the idol's eyes and instructs them to proceed <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left. The transport then accelerates up the flight of stairs.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after his}} trip to the moon, Armstrong visited the Old City of Jerusalem. Walking <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Hulda Gates, when {{informed}} of the religious belief that Jesus had walked the same steps many times, he remarked to his Israeli archaeologist guide, [...] "I am more exctied stepping on these stones than I was stepping on the moon." ...|$|E
500|$|No further {{goals were}} scored, and the referee blew for full {{time with the}} final score 3–1 to Manchester City. As the players left the field, the crowd sang a chorus of [...] "For he's a jolly good fellow" [...] in tribute to Trautmann's bravery. Roy Paul led his team <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> royal box to receive Manchester City's third FA Cup. Trautmann's neck {{continued}} to cause him pain, and the Duke of Edinburgh commented on its crooked state as he gave Trautmann his winner's medal. Three days later, an examination revealed that Trautmann had broken a bone in his neck.|$|E
2500|$|On July 7, 1865, at 1:15 P.M., a {{procession}} led by General Hartranft escorted the four condemned prisoners through {{the courtyard and}} <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gallows. Each prisoner's ankles and wrists were bound by manacles. Surratt led the way, wearing a black bombazine dress, black bonnet, and black veil. More than 1,000 people, including government officials, members of the US armed forces, friends and family of the accused, official witnesses, and reporters, watched. General Hancock limited attendance {{to those who had}} a ticket, and only those who had a good reason to be present were given a ticket. (Most of those present were military officers and soldiers, as fewer than 200 tickets had been printed.) Alexander Gardner, who had photographed the body of Booth and taken portraits of several of the male conspirators while they were imprisoned aboard naval ships, photographed the execution for the government. Hartranft read the order for their execution. Surratt, either weak from her illness or swooning in fear (perhaps both), had to be supported by two soldiers and her priests. The condemned were seated in chairs, Surratt almost collapsing into hers. She was seated {{to the right of the}} others, the traditional [...] "seat of honor" [...] in an execution. White cloth was used to bind their arms to their sides and their ankles and thighs together. The cloths around Surratt's legs were tied around her dress below the knees. Each person was ministered to by a member of the clergy. From the scaffold, Powell said, [...] "Mrs. Surratt is innocent. She doesn't deserve to die with the rest of us." [...] Fathers Jacob and Wiget prayed over her and held a crucifix to her lips. About 16 minutes elapsed from the time the prisoners entered the courtyard until they were ready for execution.|$|E

2500|$|Balmoral Place {{was about}} two hundred metres from the Police Station in Harrison Road. The police office was quite large. At ground floor level there was the main {{reception}} behind double entrance doors. Further in were various rooms used for storage. At this level were the cells for the prisoners just arrested and for those prisoners attending the magistrates' court in the building. There was no basement in the building and this was why the court was on the first floor. Access from the cells to the court was up a short flight of stairs which had a double doored cage around them and a door at the stairs' base. This was for security and allowed the magistrates or judge to 'send the prisoner down'. There were twelve cells in total and these were for short duration use only. The prisoners travelled to and from Leeds prison. There was a large courtyard between the court building and the police station which was used for police parades. The parade ground was also used for exercising the horses and housed four stables. From reception, going <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first floor the first item encountered was the police enquiry desk. Behind the desk were three corridors. One corridor to the left housed the typists' room, a small room for the senior typist and a store room. There was also a sergeants anteroom and the sergeants main room. There was another corridor to the right which housed the chief typist, an inspector, a chief inspector and a superintendent. At the far end was the chief constable's office which had a constable seated at its entrance day and night. The Criminal Investigation Department was in another corridor. There was one more set of stairs {{at the rear of}} the police station. Letters from local residents in the Press i.e. [...] "The Halifax Courier", wrote that a measure of much needed discipline continue in the Halifax Force. Richardson was considered to be the man to bring this about and he had acquired the reputation of being a strict disciplinarian which continued throughout his career. He presented his first financial accounts to the Halifax Watch Committee on 28 September 1903 where the cost of the Constabulary per week averaged £164.1s.7d. The Police were paid weekly at this time. Within weeks Richardson persuaded the Watch Committee to purchase a Black Maria, a horse and a secure trailer fitted with lockable cubicles for transporting prisoners to and from the court in Halifax to Leeds prison. He insisted the design was adjusted so that it could rapidly become an ambulance should the need arise. In 1905 he attended a meeting in Bradford of the Chief Constables Association. An official photograph by the CCA shows him, his father and his brother among 40 attendees. A similar meeting of Chief Constables in the Association took place in Brighton, Sussex, in 1906, which he attended. In August 1905 after a recommendation from the Chief Constables report of the time, the Halifax force was increased by six additional constables.|$|E
6000|$|... "Collar him! Someone {{get hold}} of his collar!" [...] cried the gold-spectacled gentleman, {{coming out of the}} scrimmage, {{retreating}} <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inn door as if to rally his forces.|$|E
60|$|He sprang nimbly ashore as the boat’s head {{touched the}} stairs, and after {{extending}} {{a hand to}} Mr. Chalk, which was coldly ignored, led the way <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> quay.|$|E

6000|$|Miss Lavinia tripped <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house-door, tripped {{down the}} steps with the key, tripped across the little garden, and opened the gate. 'Please to walk in,' said Miss Lavinia, haughtily. 'Our servant is out.' ...|$|E

60|$|Beatrice ran <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> her mother, and Harding, after {{a word of}} {{greeting}} turned away. He felt that, until he had cleared himself, {{it would be more}} becoming in him to keep away from the Colonel and Mrs. Mowbray.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not her, {{nor does}} she cook again in my house. The shock might have {{killed a man}} of my age,' said Mr. Fulton, {{breathing}} heavily, and leading <b>the</b> way <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> his own door. 'Her cat, the hussy!' he grumbled.|$|R
6000|$|He rose {{abruptly}} (we had seated {{ourselves on}} a couple of hen-coops under the break of the poop). [...] "You will excuse me. I have an order to give"; and he hurried <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> quarter-deck.|$|E

60|$|Three weeks later, as I {{lay in the}} August {{sunshine}} in a deck-chair on the lawn, I {{heard the}} sound of wheels along the gravel path.
