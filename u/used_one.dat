5|$|Because the hot recycle solids are heated in a {{separate}} furnace, the oil shale gas from these technologies is not diluted with combustion exhaust gas. Another advantage {{is that there is}} no limit on the smallest particles that the retort can process, thus allowing all the crushed feed to be <b>used.</b> <b>One</b> disadvantge is that more water is used to handle the resulting finer shale ash.|$|E

5|$|The Saturn had {{technically}} impressive hardware at {{the time}} of its release, but its complexity made harnessing this power difficult for developers accustomed to conventional programming. The greatest disadvantage was that both CPUs shared the same bus and were unable to access system memory at the same time. Making full use of the 4kB of cache memory in each CPU was critical to maintaining performance. For example, Virtua Fighter <b>used</b> <b>one</b> CPU for each character, while Nights <b>used</b> <b>one</b> CPU for 3D environments and the other for 2D objects. The Saturn's Visual Display Processor 2 (VDP2), which can generate and manipulate backgrounds, has also been cited as one of the system's most important features.|$|E

5|$|After her commissioning, Karlsruhe was {{assigned}} to overseas duties in the Caribbean. She arrived {{in the area in}} July 1914, days before the outbreak of World War I. Once the war began, she armed the passenger liner , but while the ships were transferring equipment, British ships located them and pursued Karlsruhe. Her superior speed allowed her to escape, after which she operated off the northeastern coast of Brazil. Here, she captured or sank sixteen ships. While en route to attack the shipping lanes to Barbados on 4 November 1914, a spontaneous internal explosion destroyed the ship and killed the majority of the crew.

5|$|Caddisflies {{are called}} sedges by anglers.

A mass emergence is known as a hatch. Each type has its own angling name, so for example Mystacides is the dancer; Sericostoma the caperer; Leptocerus the silverhorn; Phryganea the murragh or great red sedge; Brachycentrus subnubilis the grannom; Lepidostoma the silver sedge; Oecetis the longhorn sedge; Cheumatopsyche the little sister sedge; Helicopsyche the speckled Peter, an important fishing fly in North America; and Hydropsyche the specked sedge, perhaps the most important caddisfly genus for anglers with over 50 species of net-makers.|$|E

One of the models was a fully mobile submarine equipped with an engine built by Miami-based Perry Submarines. The car seen entering the sea was a mock-up shell, propelled off the jetty by a compressed air cannon. During the model sequences, the air bubbles seen appearing from the vehicle were created by Alka-Seltzer tablets.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Bushka rings, various other decorative rings were commonly incorporated, including various colored plastics (often marbleized), and silver and contrasting wooden rings. For decoration, Balabushka often inlaid small mother-of-pearl dots and notched diamonds. Series of window-shaped maple pieces commonly adorned Balabushka butt sleeves, with each window usually featuring one burl for its aesthetic effect. Some other features common {{to many other}} cuemakers' lines from the same era are notably absent or mostly absent from Balabushka's, including ivory inlays and the signing of his cues. A long-standing controversy exists over what finish Balabushka <b>used.</b> <b>One</b> side argues that he used an oil finish on all his cues, while the other insists that his later cues were coated with a spray lacquer.|$|E
5|$|In his American incarnation, Pedobear is an {{anthropomorphic}} bear child predator that {{is often}} used within the community to mock contributors showing a sexual interest in children.

In February 2010, a photoshopped version of Pedobear appeared along with mascots of the 2010 Winter Olympics in an article on the games in Gazeta Olsztyńska, a Polish newspaper. This was done accidentally; due to the image being used from Google Images, the authors were unaware of the joke. Similarly, the Dutch television guide Avrobode <b>used</b> <b>one</b> of the images.

5|$|The Letter Preference Task is the second-most popular {{method to}} measure {{implicit}} self-esteem, surpassed {{only by the}} Implicit Association Test. The task has also been called the Name Letter Preference Task, Name-Letter-Ratings Measure, and Initial Preference Task. There is no standard method for applying the task. The most commonly <b>used</b> <b>one</b> is a letter rating task, which involves having participants judge all {{the letters of the}} alphabet. Even within this method there are variations in the instructions (how much you like the letters or how attractive you find them), in the rating scales (five-point, seven-point, or nine-point), in the order of the letters (random or alphabetical), and in data collection (paper-and-pencil or computer-based).|$|E
5|$|The Mumbai slum set in {{the season}} finale was {{constructed}} on {{the parking lot of}} the studio, which took two to three weeks to complete.

Three main cameras were <b>used,</b> <b>one</b> of which was crane-operated. 60 extras were used, the highest number used in an Sanctuary episode. For the extras to be used in more than one scene, they wore many different costumes. The streeting area was also limited in size, so the streets were recycled frequently with every scene. The practical sets of the Sanctuary offices and corridors were also redesigned to look like the Mumbai Sanctuary.|$|E
