40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to investigate the color appearance and color connotation of unrelated colors. To investigate color appearance (i. e., brightness, colorfulness, and hue) for unrelated colors, 22 observers have answered their color appearance for 50 <b>unrelated</b> <b>color</b> stimuli using the magnitude estimation method. Perceptual data obtained by the experiment is compared with the color attributes data estimated by unrelated-color appearance models, CAM 97 u and CAM 02 u. It is found that both models perform reasonably well but the performance of CAM 02 u is better than that of CAM 97 u. For investigating color connotation for unrelated colors, 32 observers have judged their color connotation for the 50 <b>unrelated</b> <b>color</b> stimuli using the 10 color connotation scales (i. e., Warm - Cool, Heavy - Light, Modern - Classical, Clean - Dirty, Active - Passive, Hard - Soft, Tense - Relaxed, Fresh - Stale, Masculine - feminine, and like - Dislike), and semantic differential method is used for measurement. It is found that the color connotation models developed for related colors perform poorly for unrelated colors. Experimental results indicate that brightness attribute is confusing to estimate and does not affect color connotation significantly for unrelated colors. Based on the psychophysical data, new models for Warm-Cool, Heavy-Light, Active-Passive and Hard-Soft were proposed using CAM 02 u hue, brightness, and colorfulness. Color connotations for unrelated colors are classified into three categories, which Color solidity, Color heat, and Color purity. close 3...|$|E
40|$|Color is {{a salient}} feature which conveys {{important}} {{information about the}} objects in our visual world and may help identification and recognition. Previous psychophysical experiments in humans suggest that color can be beneficial in visual memory tasks, when shape information is no longer available. Here, we ask whether color in natural scenes improves object recognition under conditions in which shape information is degraded. We used a procedure based on Fourier analysis to create natural scenes, for which we manipulated color and shape information independently. Psychophysical performance of human observers was measured in a delayed matching to sample paradigm. Our observers were presented with natural scenes that contained object related (color image), irrelevant (colored noise) or no color (achromatic image and noise) for which we parametrically varied shape information by introducing noise into the images. Subjects performed significantly better when images contained object related color than no or irrele vant color information across the different noise levels (N = 8, p< 0. 05). In addition, performance across subjects did not differ for the achromatic stimuli and the images including <b>unrelated</b> <b>color.</b> Our results suggest that recognition of natural scenes can be enhanced by color information that {{is related to the}} object...|$|E
40|$|Affective & Human Factors EngineeringThe {{purposes}} of this research are to identify relation between color perception and connotation of unrelated colors, and to develop mathematical models for color connotation. This research is significant {{in the sense that}} it provides fundamental data for color appearance and color connotation of unrelated colors on which there is a lack of research until now. To achieve these purposes, two psychophysical experiments were carried out. Experiment 1 : Color perception for unrelated colors, to investigate color perception for <b>unrelated</b> <b>color</b> using the 50 color stimuli beamed through a square hole. Twenty-two observers have answered their perceived magnitudes of three color attributes based on the magnitude estimation. Experiment 2 : Color connotation for unrelated colors, to examine color connotation for unrelated colors using the 50 color stimuli. Thirty-two observers have answered their connotation about each color stimulus using the 10 color connotation scales which consist of one aesthetic scale (i. e. “like – Dislike”) and nine non-aesthetic scales (i. e. “Warm – Cool,” “Heavy – Light,” “Modern – Classical,” “Clean – Dirty,” “Active – Passive,” “Hard – Soft,” Tense – Relaxed,” “Fresh – Stale,” and “Masculine – feminine”). Semantic differential method was used for measurement of color connotation scales. The color connotation models having brightness, colorfulness and hue obtained by CAM 97 u and the revised CIECAM 02 as input variables were developed to quantify inter-relation between the color attributes and color connotation space, and further effects of the color attributes on color connotation were visually analyzed based on conventional bubble charts. The major findings from the experiments are summarized as follows: In experiment 1 : Color perception for unrelated colors, the experimental results shows that the three perceptual attributes of unrelated colors such as brightness, colorfulness and hue can be estimated by the colorimetric properties of color stimuli (i. e. luminance, excitation purity and CIE 1976 hue-angle). It is found that the estimate values of the color attributes are positively proportional to perceived magnitudes of the color attributes. The performance comparison is made of proposed estimation model with CAM 97 u and revised CIECAM 02. The revised CIECAM 02 gives the best satisfactory estimations of brightness, colorfulness and hue under photopic vision. In experiment 2 : Color connotation for unrelated colors, the experimental results shows that color connotation of unrelated colors has a three-dimensional space, and the three axes are “Color solidity,” “Color heat,” and “Color purity. ” “Color solidity” is associated with “Hard-Soft,” “Heavy-Light,” “Tense-Relaxed,” and “Active-Passive. ” “Color heat” is correlated with “Warm-Cool” and “Feminine-Masculine”, and “Color purity” has relevance to “Clean-Dirty” and “Fresh-Stale. ” In short, color connotation for unrelated colors is a function of the three color appearance attributes. All the color connotation scales are correlated with the color attributes. Four color connotation scales, “Warm-Cool,” “Heavy-Light,” “Active-Passive” and “Hard-Soft”, were modeled. The scale “Warm-Cool” is associated with hue angle and colorfulness, while significant relation between “warm-Cool” and brightness is not found. The other scales are connected with the color difference between the test color and neutral color of which brightness are varied with the color connotation scales. This implies that “Heavy-Light,” “Active-Passive” and “Hard-Soft” have relevance to colorfulness. Furthermore, the three-dimensional color connotation space for unrelated colors is associated with the color attributes. The significant correlations between the axes of the color connotation space and color attributes are as follows: “Color solidity” with colorfulness, “Color heat” with both hue angle and colorfulness, “Color purity” with brightness. There is room for further improvement and development in this research. (1) The data sets obtained by this research need to examine repeatability, (2) relationships of color connotations between unrelated colors and related colors is required to be analyzed, and (3) the results of this research should expend into applications in association with emotional lighting. ope...|$|E

40|$|The {{sunk cost}} fallacy {{is one of}} the irrational choice {{behaviors}} robustly observed in humans. This fallacy can be defined as a preference for a higher-cost alternative to a lower-cost one after previous investment in a higher-cost alternative. The present study examined this irrational choice by exposing pigeons to several types of trials with differently illuminated colors. We prepared three types of nonchoice trials for experiencing different outcomes after presenting same or different colors as alternatives and three types of choice trials for testing whether pigeons demonstrated irrational choice. In nonchoice trials, animals experienced either of the following: (1) no reinforcement after the presentation of an <b>unrelated</b> <b>colored</b> stimulus to the alternatives used in the choice situation, (2) no reinforcement after investment in the lower-cost alternative, or (3) reinforcement or no reinforcement after investment in the higher-cost alternative. In choice trials, animals were required to choose in the following three situations: (A) higher-cost vs. lower-cost alternatives, (B) higher-cost vs. lower-cost ones after some investment in the higher-cost alternative, and (C) higher-cost vs. lower-cost alternatives after the presentation of an <b>unrelated</b> <b>colored</b> stimulus.

40|$|Three {{experiments}} examined {{whether a}} Stroop effect emerges in {{the processing of}} complex Chinese characters that contain a color-related radical. In Experiment 1, a Stroop effect occurred when participants responded to the black or white color of the simple characters (black) and (white) by making a left or right keypress. For Experiment 2, in which the stimuli were complex characters whose meanings were <b>unrelated</b> to <b>color</b> but that contained or as a radical, a Stroop effect also occurred, although it was smaller than in Experiment 1. Furthermore, this Stroop effect {{as a function of}} radical meaning was shown again in Experiment 3 for low-frequency complex characters but not high-frequency ones. These results suggest that the semantic representations of the complex characters&# 39; color-related radicals are accessed {{in the context of a}} Stroop color word task, especially for low-frequency characters. Reduction of the Stroop effect in complex characters composed of one radical with color meaning and one without is similar to dilution of the Stroop effect that occurs when a color word is accompanied by a neutral word. Possible implications of the results for accounts of Stroop dilution are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the effect of prior grammatical gender {{information provided by the}} production of a bare noun on the production of a syntactically <b>unrelated,</b> gender-inflected <b>color</b> adjective. The target language was Greek. A lexical priming task involving picture nam-ing was employed. Participants saw a series of pictures, some in color and some in black-and-white; they had to name a black-and-white picture with the single noun (prime) and a color picture with the appropriately inflected color adjective (target). Prior gender information was shown to affect subsequent production of gender-marked words. The effect was restricted to nouns of one gender class (masculine) only. The implications of these results for the repre-sentation and processing of gender in production are discussed. ª 2001 Elsevier Science (USA) Grammatical gender is a syntactic property of words; its representation, retrieval, and use have been examined in a number of recent studies (e. g., see Friederici & Jacobsen, 1999, for a review of grammatical gender in word recognition; Schriefers & Jescheniak, 1999, for a review of grammatical gender in word production) with re-spect to the functional architecture and the retrieval mechanisms of the mental lexicon (e. g., Caramazza, 1997; Levelt, Roelofs, & Meyer, 1999).

40|$|It {{has been}} claimed that stimuli sharing {{the color of}} the nogo-target are {{suppressed}} because of the strong incentive to not process the nogo-target, but we failed to replicate this finding. Participants searched for a color singleton in the target display and indicated its shape when it was in the go color. If the color singleton in the target display was in the nogo color, they had to withhold the response. The target display was preceded by a cue display that also contained a color singleton (the cue). The cue was either in {{the color of the}} go or nogo target, or it was in an <b>unrelated,</b> neutral <b>color.</b> With cues in the go color, reaction times (RTs) were shorter when the cue appeared at the same location as the target compared to when it appeared at a different location. Also, electrophysiological recordings showed that an index of attentional selection, the N 2 pc, was elicited by go cues. Surprisingly, we failed to replicate cueing costs for cues in the nogo color that were originally reported by Anderson and Folk (2012). Consistently, we also failed to find an electrophysiological index of attentional suppression (the PD) for cues in the nogo color. Further, fronto-central ERPs to the cue display showed the same negativity for nogo and neutral stimuli relative to go stimuli, which is at odds with response inhibition and conflict monitoring accounts of the Nogo-N 2. Thus, the modified cueing paradigm employed here provides little evidence that features associated with nogo-targets are suppressed at the level of attention or response selection. Rather, nogo-stimuli are efficiently ignored and attention is focused on features that require a response...|$|R
40|$|Attention selects stimuli for perceptual and {{cognitive}} processing {{according to an}} adaptive selection schedule. It {{has long been known}} that attention selects stimuli that are task relevant or perceptually salient. Recent evidence has shown that stimuli previously associated with reward persistently capture attention involuntarily, even when they are no longer associated with reward. Here we examine whether the capture of attention by previously reward-associated stimuli is modulated by the processing of current but unrelated rewards. Participants learned to associate two color stimuli with different amounts of reward during a training phase. In a subsequent test phase, these previously rewarded color stimuli were occasionally presented as to-be-ignored distractors while participants performed visual search for each of two differentially rewarded shape-defined targets. The results reveal that attentional capture by formerly rewarded distractors was the largest when both recently received and currently expected reward were the highest in the test phase, even though such rewards were <b>unrelated</b> to the <b>color</b> distractors. Our findings support a model in which value-driven attentional biases acquired through reward learning are maintained via the cognitive mechanisms involved in predicting future rewards...|$|R
40|$|An {{algorithm}} is proposed for the spectral and colorimetric characterization of digital still cameras (DSC) which allows to use them as tele-colorimeters with CIE-XYZ color output, in cd/m 2. The spectral characterization consists of the calculation of the color-matching functions from the previously measured spectral sensitivities. The colorimetric characterization consists of transforming the RGB digital data into absolute tristimulus values CIE-XYZ (in cd/m 2) under variable and unknown spectroradiometric conditions. Thus, at the first stage, a gray balance has been applied over the RGB digital data to convert them into RGB relative colorimetric values. At a second stage, an algorithm of luminance adaptation vs. lens aperture has been inserted in the basic colorimetric profile. Capturing the ColorChecker chart under different light sources, the DSC color analysis accuracy indexes, both in a raw state and with the corrections from a linear model of color correction, have been evaluated using the Pointer' 86 color reproduction index with the <b>unrelated</b> Hunt' 91 <b>color</b> appearance model. The results indicate that our digital image capture device, in raw performance, lightens and desaturates the colors. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|Four pigeons {{received}} conditional discrimination {{training in}} which reinforcement contingencies {{were related to}} specific combinations of color and form, but were <b>unrelated</b> to either <b>color</b> or form considered separately. During discrete-trial training, each response {{in the presence of}} two of four color-form displays produced reinforcement and terminated the trial; responding to the other two displays was never reinforced, and each such response prolonged the particular trial on which it occurred. Subsequently, the subjects received multiple-schedule training in which responding to either of the displays previously associated with reinforcement was now reinforced on a variable-interval schedule, and extinction was the schedule again correlated with the other two displays. After differential responding to the stimuli was clearly evident, intensity of the combination displays was changed in subsequent training sessions. Complex stimulus control was generally maintained across variation in intensity, although there were temporary disruptions in performance associated with onset of some of the intensity changes. Finally, a component-stimulus test revealed considerably more responding to the forms than to the colors...|$|R
40|$|Some of the routing {{protocols}} used in telecommunication networks route traffic on a shortest path tree according to configurable integral link weights. One crucial issue for network operators {{is finding a}} weight function that ensures a stable routing: when some link fails, traffic whose path does not use that link should not be rerouted. In this paper we improve on several previously best results for finding small stable weights. As a conceptual contribution, we draw {{a connection between the}} stable weights problem and the seemingly <b>unrelated</b> unique-max <b>coloring</b> problem. In unique-max coloring, one is given a set of points and a family of subsets of those points called regions. The task is to assign to each region a color represented as an integer such that, for every point, one region containing it has a color strictly larger than the color of any other region containing this point. In our setting, points and regions become edges and paths of the shortest path tree, respectively, and based on this connection, we provide stable weight functions with a maximum weight of O(n log n) in the case of single link failure, where n is the number of vertices in the network. Furthermore, if the root of the shortest path tree is known, we present an algorithm for determining stable weights bounded by $ 4 n$, which is optimal up to constant factors. For the case of an arbitrary number of failures, we show how stable weights bounded by 3 [superscript n] n can be obtained. All the results improve on the previously best known bounds.

40|$|Abstract only availableFall {{armyworm}} (FAW) and southwestern corn borer (SWCB) are {{insect pests}} of maize which cause {{large amounts of}} feeding damage annually in the United States. Previous proteomic analysis of resistant and susceptible lines of maize showed proteins involved with the photosynthetic pathway were differentially expressed in the resistant line. The high chlorophyll fluorescent (hcf) mutants contain defects in the photsystem I or II pathways. These defects lead to disrupted electron transport within the photosynthetic pathway. Preference tests comparing several hcf mutants to wild-type siblings determined genes involved in photosynthesis {{had an effect on}} insect feeding. Antibiosis tests were performed using mutant and wild-type leaf tissue to determine their effect on larval weight gain. Leaf feeding damage was assessed using the AlphaEase software from digital images. Individual larval weights were determined in milligrams. hcf 7 -N 1029 D significantly decreased larval feeding damage for both FAW and SWCB. hcf*- 88 - 3005 - 3, hcf 11 -N 1250 A, and hcf 48 -N 1282 C significantly increased larval feeding damage for both Lepidoptera. The combined data from both the antibiosis and preference tests reveal that photosystem II genes {{have a significant effect on}} larval feeding which is <b>unrelated</b> to leaf <b>color.</b> Further, these genes are contained within the stromal thylakoid where fatty acid precursors are produced for epicuticular wax synthesis.
