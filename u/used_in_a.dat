5|$|Broaching is a {{machining}} process {{that uses a}} toothed tool, called a broach, to remove material. There are two main types of broaching: linear and rotary. In linear broaching, which is the more common process, the broach is run linearly against a surface of the workpiece to effect the cut. Linear broaches are <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> broaching machine, which is also sometimes shortened to broach. In rotary broaching, the broach is rotated and pressed into the workpiece to cut an axisymmetric shape. A rotary broach is <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lathe or screw machine. In both processes the cut is performed in one pass of the broach, which makes it very efficient.|$|E
