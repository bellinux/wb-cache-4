500|$|Gout is a {{disorder}} of purine metabolism, and occurs when its final metabolite, uric acid, crystallizes {{in the form}} of monosodium urate, precipitating and forming deposits (tophi) in joints, on tendons and in the surrounding tissues.

Naked crystals may break out of walled-off tophi due to minor physical damage to the joint, medical or surgical stress, or rapid changes in uric acid levels. When they break through the tophi, they trigger a local immune-mediated inflammatory reaction in macrophages, which is initiated by the NLRP3 inflammasome protein complex. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome recruits the enzyme caspase 1, which converts pro-interleukin 1β [...] into active interleukin 1β, one of the key proteins in the inflammatory cascade.

5000|$|Hyperuricemia in Dalmatians (as in all breeds) is inherited, {{but unlike}} other breeds, the [...] "normal" [...] gene for <b>uricase</b> {{is not present}} in the breed's gene pool. Therefore, there is no {{possibility}} of eliminating hyperuricemia among pure-bred Dalmatians. The only possible {{solution to this problem}} must then be crossing Dalmatians with other breeds to reintroduce the [...] "normal" [...] <b>uricase</b> gene. This led to the foundation of the Dalmatian-Pointer Backcross Project, which aims to reintroduce the normal <b>uricase</b> gene into the Dalmatian breed. The backcross used a single English Pointer; subsequent breedings have all been to purebred Dalmatians. This project was started in 1973 by Dr. Robert Schaible. The first cross (F1) hybrids did not resemble Dalmatians very closely. The F1s were then crossed back to purebreds. This breeding produced puppies of closer resemblance to the pure Dalmatian. By the fifth generation in 1981, they resembled purebreds so much, Dr. Schaible convinced the AKC to allow two of the hybrids to be registered as purebreds. Then AKC President William F. Stifel stated, [...] "If there is a logical, scientific way to correct genetic health problems associated with certain breed traits and still preserve the integrity of the breed standard, it is incumbent upon the American Kennel Club to lead the way." [...] The Dalmatian Club of America's (DCA) board of directors supported this decision, however it quickly became highly controversial among the club members. A vote by DCA members opposed the registration of the hybrids, causing the AKC to ban registration to any of the dog's offspring. At the annual general meeting of the DCA in May 2006, the backcross issue was discussed again by club members. In June of the same year, DCA members were presented with an opportunity to vote on whether to reopen discussion of the Dalmatian Backcross Project. The results of this ballot were nearly 2:1 in favor of re-examining support of the project by the DCA. This has begun with publication of articles presenting more information both in support of and questioning the need for this project. In July 2011, the AKC agreed to allow registration of backcrossed Dalmatians.|$|E
50|$|Bacillus fastidious has {{the ability}} to use <b>uricase</b> to degrade uric acid to {{allantoin}}, and then use allantoinase to degrade allantoin to allantoate. It also {{has the ability}} to further break down allantoate to ammonia and ureidoglycolate via the enzyme allantoate amidohydrolase. The liberation of ammonia causes its local environment to rise to a pH between 8 and 9. However, attempts to grow Bacillus fastidious at those higher pH's without urea present were unsuccessful. It is able to metabolize ureidoglycolate further into urea and glyoxylate using the enzyme ureidoglycolase. Bacillus fastidious is also able to use urease to degrade urea.|$|E
50|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, {{specifically}} in linear amidines. The systematic name of this enzyme class is allantoate amidinohydrolase. This enzyme participates in purine metabolism by facilitating the utilization of purines as secondary nitrogen sources under nitrogen-limiting conditions. While purine degradation converges to uric acid in all vertebrates, its further degradation varies from species to species. Uric acid is excreted by birds, reptiles, and some mammals that do not have a functional <b>uricase</b> gene, whereas other mammals produce allantoin. Amphibians and microorganisms produce ammonia and carbon dioxide using the uricolytic pathway. Allantoicase performs the second step in this pathway catalyzing the conversion of allantoate into ureidoglycolate and urea.|$|E

The holoprotein showed <b>uricase</b> (EC 1. 7. 3. 3) activity.

The native molecule contains ˜ 1. 0 mol Cu 2 + per mol, has an isoelectric point of ˜ 9. 0 and a pH optimum for <b>uricase</b> activity at 9. 5. <b>Uricase</b> activity found in young uninfected soybean roots is due to another form of enzyme (<b>uricase</b> I) which is of ˜ 190 kd, has maximum activity at pH 8. 0 and does not contain any subunit corresponding in size to nodulin- 35. <b>Uricase</b> I, also present in young infected roots, declines {{at a time when}} nodulin- 35 appears.
