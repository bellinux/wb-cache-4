25|$|On 10 October CWU {{members in}} London and Liverpool started an <b>unofficial</b> <b>strike</b> in {{response}} to changes in flexible working that meant {{they would have to}} start at 6am and finish not before 2.15pm. It was reported that all of South West London is out, East London, Peterbrough, Walsall and Manchester also were involved in unofficial action.|$|E
25|$|In 1936, {{residents}} of Shadwell {{were involved in}} the Battle of Cable Street, in which Oswald Mosley's attempted fascist march from Tower Hill to Aldgate via Shadwell (which was predominantly Jewish) was stopped by 250,000 protestors blocking their path by overturning a lorry. In 1982, a mural was created to commemorate the moment, and was restored in 2011. Workers in Shadwell had previously opposed the British Union of Fascists, and in 1937, Shadwell dockers threatened an <b>unofficial</b> <b>strike</b> after local casual dock labourer Cecil Anthony Hiron was nominated as a BUF candidate in the Stepney Council elections in November; Hiron later withdrew his nomination.|$|E
25|$|His {{activities}} led to Heffer becoming known through Liverpool {{where he}} served on the Executive of the Trades Council; he was its Vice President in 1958, President in 1959 and again in 1964. The Trades Council was a local association of trade unions, and as such Heffer helped mediate and end an <b>unofficial</b> <b>strike</b> of seamen in 1960. He was also elected as a Liverpool City Councillor for Pirrie ward that year. In 1962 he made {{a run for the}} job of General Secretary of the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers, but was defeated. Heffer made a contribution to a book, The Agreeable Autocracies, which was published in 1961. The book was a discussion of United States institutions.|$|E

5000|$|Following its broadcast, Mary Whitehouse, {{president}} of the National Viewers' and Listeners' Association, wrote to both Prime Minister Harold Wilson and Leader of the Opposition Edward Heath, demanding that they review {{the charter of the}} BBC in light of its transmission of [...] "a blueprint for the communist takeover of the docks." [...] <b>Unofficial</b> <b>strikes</b> were the subject of political debate at the time, and the government had proposed a ban on <b>unofficial</b> <b>strikes</b> the previous month in the paper In Place of Strife.|$|R
50|$|Passed {{under the}} new {{government}} of Edward Heath, the Industrial Relations Act 1971 made such <b>unofficial</b> <b>strikes</b> illegal. This Act is mentioned {{towards the end of}} the film.|$|R
500|$|With {{no party}} {{organisation}} and only his own financial resources, Davies's campaign was initially very low-key. His election literature {{was a single}} sheet with the message [...] "You Know Me, I've Never Let You Down". As polling day approached, however, {{it was clear that}} he was gathering support, particularly among the young—a great irony, Alun Morgan observes, for a man sacked on the grounds of his age. In the final week before polling day on 18 June Davies's youthful supporters toured the constituency with songs, slogans and cheerleaders in what Griffiths describes as [...] "the most colourful election bandwaggon seen in Merthyr for 40 years". The official Labour campaign stalled, as Lloyd became embroiled in a row over his role in the failure of the AEU to support an <b>unofficial</b> <b>strike</b> at the local Hoover factory. On polling day, amid scenes of jubilation. Davies was returned with a majority of 7,467 over Lloyd. Davies responded to his victory by thanking the voters whom, he said, he had never thought for a moment would let him down. Two weeks later Davies and his principal campaign workers were expelled from the Labour Party for opposing its official candidate. The national leadership refused his request for an official inquiry into the actions of the Merthyr party, in the selection process and during the election itself.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1940s three 8-hour shifts were worked {{each day}} for six days a week. The miners worked on [...] "group piece work." [...] Each group was paid {{fortnightly}} according {{to the amount of}} work done, measured in cubic fathoms in the stopes, or in feet for driving levels or sinking winzes. The cost of explosives used, and of carbide supplied for lamps, was deducted from the payments made. Surface workers in the mill were paid weekly wages. Poor labour relations at the time led to an <b>unofficial</b> <b>strike</b> in 1942; the men on weekly rates eventually received an increase of 2 shillings per day following a similar settlement in the West Cumberland iron mines.|$|E
2500|$|Sensitive to {{the impact}} of {{proposed}} closures, miners in various coalfields began strike action. In [...] Yorkshire, miners at Manvers, Cadeby, Silverwood, Kiveton Park and Yorkshire Main were on <b>unofficial</b> <b>strike</b> for other issues before official action was called. More than 6,000 miners were on strike from 5 March at Cortonwood and Bullcliffe Wood, near Wakefield. Neither pit's reserves were exhausted. Bullcliffe Wood had been under threat, but Cortonwood had been considered safe. Action was prompted on 5 March by the NCB's announcement that five pits would be subject to [...] "accelerated closure" [...] in just five weeks; the other three were Herrington in County Durham, Snowdown in Kent and Polmaise in Scotland. The next day, pickets from Yorkshire appeared at pits in Nottinghamshire and Harworth Colliery closed after a mass influx of pickets amid claims that Nottinghamshire was [...] "scabland in 1926". On 12 March 1984, Scargill declared the NUM's support for the regional strikes in Yorkshire and Scotland, and called for action from NUM members in all other areas but decided not to hold a nationwide vote which was used by his opponents to delegitimise the strike.|$|E
50|$|The film {{ends with}} Eddie critiquing the Industrial Relations Act 1971 for forbidding <b>unofficial</b> <b>strikes.</b> He quotes Trotsky's vision {{of hope that}} the young {{will go on to}} make a {{brighter}} future.|$|R
25|$|Despite {{mainstream}} Labour Party's {{support for}} the coalition the Independent Labour Party was instrumental in opposing conscription through organisations such as the Non-Conscription Fellowship while a Labour Party affiliate, the British Socialist Party, organised a number of <b>unofficial</b> <b>strikes.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{short term}} behind bars {{was because the}} Trades Disputes Actof 1927 was used against the {{supporters}} of the strike among whom the WIL were prominent. Their earlier support for <b>unofficial</b> <b>strikes</b> in the coalfields, particularly in Kent, had also drawn upon them {{the attention of the}} authorities.|$|R
2500|$|The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) {{came into}} being in 1945 and in 1947 most collieries in Britain were nationalised (958 nationalised, 400 private). Demand for coal was high in the years {{following}} the Second World War, and Polish refugees were drafted to work in the pits. [...] Over time, coal's share in the energy market declined relative to oil and nuclear. Large-scale closures of collieries occurred in the 1960s, which led to migration of miners from the run-down coalfields (Scotland, Wales, Lancashire, the north-east of England) to Yorkshire and the Midlands coalfields. After a period of inaction from the NUM leadership over employment cuts, there was an <b>unofficial</b> <b>strike</b> in 1969, after which many more militant candidates were elected to NUM leadership. [...] The threshold for endorsement of strike action in a national ballot was reduced from two-thirds in favour to 55% in 1971. [...] There was then success in the national strike in 1972, an overtime ban, and the subsequent strike in 1974 (which led to the Three Day Week). The NUM's success in bringing down the Heath government demonstrated its power, but it caused resentment at their demand to be treated as a special case in wage negotiations.|$|E

50|$|An {{official}} strike is a strike organised and recognised by a labour union, {{as opposed to}} an <b>unofficial</b> <b>strike</b> at grassroots level.|$|E
2500|$|David Amos {{noted that}} some pits in Nottinghamshire closed in the early 1980s. [...] He argues that Nottinghamshire miners reacted {{in the same way}} in 1984 as they did to the <b>unofficial</b> <b>strikes</b> in 1969 and 1970, both of which saw blockading of Nottinghamshire pits by {{striking}} miners from South Yorkshire and both of which were regarded as unconstitutional under NUM rules.|$|R
50|$|Also, during 1948 and 1949 {{there were}} lengthy <b>unofficial</b> <b>strikes,</b> {{particularly}} in the docks, so the Labour Attlee Government implemented this Act to proclaim {{a state of emergency}} and used soldiers as strike-breakers by getting them to unload boats in London, Liverpool and Avonmouth. The Conservative government used the Act during the 1955 rail strike and it was also used by Labour under Harold Wilson during the seamen's strike of 1966.|$|R
50|$|Generally, strikes are rare: {{according}} to the News Media Guild, 98% of union contracts in the United States are settled each year without a strike. Occasionally, workers decide to strike without the sanction of a labor union, either because the union refuses to endorse such a tactic, or because the workers concerned are not unionized. Such strikes are often described as <b>unofficial.</b> <b>Strikes</b> without formal union authorization are also known as wildcat strikes.|$|R

5000|$|Haxell {{worked as}} an {{electrician}} and joined the Electrical Trades Union in 1929. In 1935, he joined the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB). [...] A prominent and militant activist, he supported an <b>unofficial</b> <b>strike</b> in Chorley, Lancashire, in 1939, {{and as a result}} was barred from holding office in the union for five years.|$|E
50|$|Following their arrest, {{a rolling}} series of strikes began to cause work {{stoppages}} {{until there was}} virtually an <b>unofficial</b> national <b>strike.</b>|$|R
50|$|The action led to {{discussions on}} the NUM's {{threshold}} of a two-thirds majority for a national strike. Many {{argued that it was}} too high and that the 1969 action could have been handled better otherwise. There were further <b>unofficial</b> <b>strikes</b> in the militant collieries in 1970 after a ballot for national action achieved a majority for action of 55%, which was too low for the strike to be authorised. In 1971, the threshold for a majority for strike action was reduced to 55%.|$|R
50|$|The NUS's almost {{closed shop}} made the union stronger. After the Second World War there were {{widespread}} calls for {{reform of the}} NUS. Many members felt that the union was too {{closely associated with the}} employers and that it had failed to defend its members' interests. Rank and File Committees, building on the earlier Minority Movement, were established in many ports, and <b>unofficial</b> <b>strikes</b> took place in 1947, 1955 and 1960. A National Seamen's Reform Movement was established in the latter year.|$|R
50|$|Further {{disruption}} {{was caused}} on 16 February when rail workers in southern Belgium staged an <b>unofficial</b> <b>strike</b> in protest {{at what they}} described as a deterioration in their working conditions. No trains at all were running out of Mons or Tournai, while between a third {{and a half of}} trains from Namur and Charleroi to Brussels were cancelled.|$|E
50|$|In March 1936 an <b>unofficial</b> <b>strike</b> aboard California in port at San Pedro, Los Angeles, {{held without}} the {{sanction}} of the International Seamen's Union, {{led to the}} foundation of the National Maritime Union. The dispute was about wage rates and overtime payments. The strike lasted only three days but Panama Pacific never fully recovered from it.|$|E

5000|$|The strike {{took place}} {{near the end}} of Harold Wilson's first government. The <b>unofficial</b> <b>strikes</b> and student protests in France in May 1968 were {{influential}} amongst the left-wing in the UK, and there was a subsequent increase in strikes taken outside of the union framework, most notably the miners' strike of October 1969. [...] The union at Pilkington, the General and Municipal Worker’s Union, was strongly supportive of Wilson and did not support the strike launched by the glass workers in 1970.|$|R
5000|$|Around 1929 the {{adoption}} of more radical Third Period strategies led the Communist Party to alter its approach towards unions entirely. Instead of the [...] "boring from within" [...] strategy employed by the NMM and similar organizations in other countries, a move was made towards the support of <b>unofficial</b> <b>strikes</b> and alternative [...] "dual" [...] unions. The NMM attempted to set itself up as a federation of such groups outside the existing unions rather than its previous purpose as a pressure group within those unions.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{mainstream}} Labour Party's {{support for}} the war effort, the Independent Labour Party was instrumental in opposing conscription through organisations such as the Non-Conscription Fellowship while a Labour Party affiliate, the British Socialist Party, organised a number of <b>unofficial</b> <b>strikes.</b> Arthur Henderson resigned from the Cabinet in 1917 amid calls for party unity to be replaced by George Barnes. Overall, however, the majority of the movement continued to support the war {{for the duration of the}} conflict, and the British Labour Party, unlike most of its equivalents on the Continent, did not split over the war.|$|R
5000|$|The film {{is based}} on an <b>unofficial</b> <b>strike</b> amongst female textile workers in Leeds in February 1970, {{demanding}} equal pay with male workers. Dramatist Colin Welland's mother-in-law was involved in the strike, and Welland interviewed many of those involved while preparing his script. [...] This was the first strike by the textile workers in Leeds in 36 years.|$|E
50|$|Many {{of those}} on <b>unofficial</b> <b>strike</b> began to make demands for change in the {{leadership}} of the NUM, and they set up strike committees to bypass the official union bodies. The union had avoided making demands of Labour governments since the Second World War, and it had been largely inactive during a period of widespread pit closures under the first Wilson government.|$|E
50|$|When the war ended, Briscoe {{returned}} to the mines, where he became active in the Yorkshire Area of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), being elected first to his branch committee, then {{as president of the}} branch at Armthorpe. From there, he was promoted to become Secretary of the NUM's Doncaster Area Panel, in which he developed a reputation as a supporter of militant action, including an <b>unofficial</b> <b>strike</b> in 1969.|$|E
5000|$|By a {{young age}} he had already succumbed to radicalism and is given as the {{secretary}} of the Hackney Branch of the Socialist League by around 1887. He would maintain links with the Socialist League, particularly helping with its publication Commonweal (which ran until about 1894) but by 1890 he had taken up a position in Leicester as a [...] working in the boot and shoe trade. In is all too brief stay in Leicester he was responsible for <b>unofficial</b> <b>strikes</b> in the boot and shoe trade, organising Leicester’s first May Day demonstration in 1893 and becoming a delegate for the National Union of Boot and Shoe Operatives (NUBSO).|$|R
5000|$|During the 1970s, union {{organisation}} in British Leyland {{was split}} between the largely Communist Party-oriented stewards under Etheridge, and later Robinson, at Longbridge, and {{a smaller number of}} Trotskyist stewards based at the more militant Cowley plant. Many of the individual workers, however, took a more militant line than that espoused by the CP officials. An article by Frank Hughes in Workers' Liberty suggests that Robinson, by supporting the introduction of the measured day work system in place of piecework and by encouraging the adoption of [...] "participation" [...] in fact destroyed the relationship between stewards and the shop floor and left them unable to control <b>unofficial</b> <b>strikes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The filmmaker Ken Loach {{suggested}} that Robinson was unfairly smeared {{by the press}} of the time; contrary to their depiction of him controlling strikes at will, Loach claimed, he in fact {{spent much of his}} time attempting to prevent <b>unofficial</b> <b>strikes.</b> This viewpoint was examined by Loach in part of an (untransmitted) documentary film series, Questions of Leadership (1983). Margaret Thatcher later described Robinson in her memoirs as a [...] "notorious agitator". Many years later, Robinson commented [...] "The pressures were immense but {{were it not for the}} ideological understanding that I had, I could very well have ended up with a nervous breakdown".|$|R
