25|$|There is {{support for}} several methods of {{sharpening}} and blurring images, including the blur and sharpen tool. The <b>unsharp</b> mask tool {{is used to}} sharpen an image selectively— it only sharpens areas of an image that are sufficiently detailed. The <b>Unsharp</b> Mask tool is considered to give more targeted results for photographs than a normal sharpening filter. The Selective Gaussian Blur tool works in a similar way, except it blurs areas of an image with little detail.|$|E
25|$|Although a small DOF {{implies that}} {{other parts of}} the image will be <b>unsharp,</b> it does not, by itself, {{determine}} how <b>unsharp</b> those parts will be. The amount of background (or foreground) blur depends on the distance from the plane of focus, so if a background is close to the subject, {{it may be difficult to}} blur sufficiently even with a small DOF. In practice, the lens f-number is usually adjusted until the background or foreground is acceptably blurred, often without direct concern for the DOF.|$|E
25|$|Post-capture {{manipulation}} of the image is ignored. Sharpening via techniques such as deconvolution or <b>unsharp</b> mask can increase the apparent sharpness in the final image; conversely, image noise reduction can reduce sharpness.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes, however, it is {{desirable}} to have the entire subject sharp while ensuring that the background is sufficiently <b>unsharp.</b> When the distance between subject and background is fixed, {{as is the case}} with many scenes, the DOF and the amount of background blur are not independent. Although it is not always possible to achieve both the desired subject sharpness and the desired background unsharpness, several techniques can be used to increase the separation of subject and background.|$|E
25|$|The lens {{designer}} cannot restrict {{analysis to}} Gaussian optics and cannot ignore lens aberrations. However, {{the requirements of}} practical photography are less demanding than those of lens design, and despite the simplifications employed in development of most DOF formulas, these formulas have proven useful in determining camera settings that result in acceptably sharp pictures. It should be recognized that DOF limits are not hard boundaries between sharp and <b>unsharp,</b> {{and that there is}} little point in determining DOF limits to a precision of many significant figures.|$|E
25|$|High-pass and {{low-pass}} filters {{are also used}} in digital image processing to perform image modifications, enhancements, noise reduction, etc., using designs done in either the spatial domain or the frequency domain. The <b>unsharp</b> masking, or sharpening, operation used in image editing software is a high-boost filter, a generalization of high-pass. A high-pass filter, if the imaging software does not provide one, {{can be achieved by}} duplicating the image, applying a Gaussian blur to the dupe, inverting the colors, and blending the images using a low opacity (say 50%) for the dupe.|$|E

2500|$|One simple form of {{tone mapping}} takes a {{standard}} image (not HDR – the dynamic range already compressed) and applies <b>unsharp</b> masking {{with a large}} radius, which increases local contrast rather than sharpening. See [...] for details.|$|E
2500|$|The {{measurement}} {{volume is}} a convolution of illumination (excitation) and detection geometries, which {{result from the}} optical elements involved. The resulting volume is described mathematically by the point spread function (or PSF), it is essentially {{the image of a}} point source. The PSF is often described as an ellipsoid (with <b>unsharp</b> boundaries) of few hundred nanometers in focus diameter, and almost one micrometer along the optical axis. The shape varies significantly (and has a large impact on the resulting FCS curves) depending {{on the quality of the}} optical elements (it is crucial to avoid astigmatism and to check the real shape of the PSF on the instrument). In the case of confocal microscopy, and for small pinholes (around one Airy unit), the PSF is well approximated by Gaussians: ...|$|E
2500|$|Precise {{focus is}} {{possible}} at only one distance; at that distance, a point object {{will produce a}} point image. At any other distance, a point object is defocused, and will produce a blur spot shaped like the aperture, which {{for the purpose of}} analysis is usually assumed to be circular. When this circular spot is sufficiently small, it is indistinguishable from a point, and appears to be in focus; it is rendered as [...] "acceptably sharp". The diameter of the circle increases with distance from the point of focus; the largest circle that is indistinguishable from a point is known as the acceptable circle of confusion, or informally, simply as the circle of confusion. The acceptable circle of confusion is influenced by visual acuity, viewing conditions, and the amount by which the image is enlarged (Ray 2000, 52–53). The increase of the circle diameter with defocus is gradual, so the limits of depth of field are not hard boundaries between sharp and <b>unsharp.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In the {{photographic}} procedure, {{the amount of}} blurring can be controlled by changing the [...] "softness" [...] or [...] "hardness" [...] (from point source to fully diffuse) of the light source used for the initial <b>unsharp</b> mask exposure, while {{the strength of the}} effect can be controlled by changing the contrast and density (i.e., exposure and development) of the <b>unsharp</b> mask.|$|E

50|$|A {{derivative}} of contrast masking is <b>unsharp</b> masking, an unusual {{term for a}} process intended to increase the apparent sharpness (acutance) of an image. <b>Unsharp</b> masking uses a blurred form of the image to increase contrast along regions of moderate contrast difference. Around edges, the blur region causes highlights to overexpose and shadows to underexpose. Taken to an extreme, the edges become overly visible and detract from {{the quality of the}} image—this is referred to as halation.|$|E
