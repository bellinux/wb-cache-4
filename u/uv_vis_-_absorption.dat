40|$|Prolonged {{exposure}} to X-rays of HAuCl 4 deposited from an aqueous solution onto a SiO 2 /Si substrate or into a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix induces {{reduction of the}} Au 3 + ions to Au 0 and subsequent nucleation to gold nanoclusters as recorded by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The corresponding major oxidation product is determined as chlorine {HAuCl 4 (ads) + X-rays -Au(ads) + (3 / 2) Cl 2 (ada) + HCl(ads) }, which is initially adsorbed onto the surface but eventually diffuses {{out of the system}} into the vacuum. The reduced gold atoms aggregate (three-dimensionally) into gold nanoclusters as evidenced by the variation in the binding energy during X-ray exposure, which starts as 1. 3 eV but approaches a value that is 0. 5 eV higher than that of the bulk gold. The disappearance of the oxidation product (Cl 2 p signal) and the growth of the nanoclusters (related to the measured binding energy difference between the Si 2 p of the oxide and Au 4 f of the reduced gold) exhibit first-order kinetics which is approximately 3 times slower than the reduction of Au 3 +, indicating that both of the former processes are diffusion controlled.

This is attributed to a radiation-induced dehydrochlorination (loss of HCl) of PVC, which in turn oxidizes (dopes) PANI within the PVC matrix causing the increase in electrical conductivity of these films. XPS, <b>UV</b> <b>-</b> <b>vis</b> <b>-</b> NIR and FTIR spectroscopic methods are used to characterize and verify this novel process. After the films are subjected to γ-rays (or UV radiation) the intensities in the XPS spectra of both -N+- and Cl- peaks increase, confirming the increase in charged species within the PVC matrix.

Introduction. Organic NLO materials with excellent optical characteristics such as high sensitivity and short response time have attracted much attention due to their potential applications in optical switching, optical processing, optical computing, optical data storage and terahertz (THZ) technology. Among the numerous organic materials, the well-known and most investigated organic NLO crystal is the stilbazolium salt trans- 4 -N-(dimethylamino) -N-Methyl- 4 -stilbazolium tosylate (DAST). It has very high electro optical (EO) and NLO figures of merit. Among all the other organic THz material, DAST has the largest NLO coefficient, d 11 of 540 ± 110 pm/V at ~ 1540 nm, EO figure of merit r 11 = 47 ± 8 pm/V at ~ 1535 nm and lower dielectric constant making it suitable for optoelectronic applications [1, 2]. The advancement {{in the field of}} photonics have increased the demand for new nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. Especially, molecules exhibiting strong two photon absorption (TPA) are of practical importance in photons applications such as frequency up conversion lasing, three dimensional fluorescence imaging and multi photon microscopy,eye and sensor protection, optical signal reshaping and stabilizing fast fluctuations of laser power. To expand these utilizing, designing the molecule with large TPA cross section plays a vital role [3]. DAST crystal can generate short THz pulse by optical rectification with a sub-picosecond laser [4, 5], or widely tunable THz waves by different frequency generation (DFG) with a dual wavelength nanosecond laser [6]. In this present study, the tosylate anion of DAST is replaced by Hexafluorophosphate (PF- 6) and two methyl group along with nitrogen in the cation is replaced by ethoxy group for achieving the stilbazolium crystal 4 -Ethoxy benzaldehyde 4 '-N'-methyl stilbazolium Hexafluorophosphate (EMBSHP).
