5|$|Club Europe is the short-haul {{business}} class on all short-haul flights. This class allows {{for access to}} business lounges at most airports. Club Europe provides seats in a 2–2 configuration on narrowbody aircraft, with the middle seat not <b>used.</b> <b>Instead,</b> a table folds up from under the middle seat on refurbished aircraft. Pillows and blankets are available on longer flights.|$|E
5|$|Early {{reports on}} the {{centrifugal}} method indicated {{that it was not}} as efficient as predicted. Urey suggested that a more efficient but technically more complicated countercurrent system be <b>used</b> <b>instead</b> of the previous flow-through method. By November 1941, technical obstacles seemed formidable enough for the process to be abandoned. Countercurrent centrifuges were developed after the war, and today are the favored method in many countries.|$|E
5|$|Helium {{is used as}} a {{shielding}} gas in arc welding processes on materials that at welding temperatures are contaminated and weakened by air or nitrogen. A number of inert {{shielding gas}}es are used in gas tungsten arc welding, but helium is <b>used</b> <b>instead</b> of cheaper argon especially for welding materials that have higher heat conductivity, like aluminium or copper.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the game}} was noted to have some flaws. The game was criticized for its uneven {{difficulty}}. Reviewers have also noted some difficulty in getting the game to recognize the correct Celestial Brush patterns, as well as excessive amounts of dialog, particularly at the introduction, which was also hampered by the computer-generated voices <b>used</b> <b>instead</b> of voice acting.|$|E
5|$|In August 1649 {{a wooden}} {{staircase}} {{was built to}} the outside wall of the tower and an open iron fire grate affixed to the top. Originally it was planned to burn coal in the lighthouse, but due to high transport costs of coal, wood was <b>used</b> <b>instead.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Thayer's second print run, in 1844, he {{used the}} same litho stones as used in the first edition. Green was <b>used</b> <b>instead</b> of goldish brown and the endspace {{remained}} an octagon. By September 24, 1844, between 3000 and 4000 of the Thayer printed games were sold by its publishers, W. &. S.B. Ives.|$|E

5|$|In {{directed}} graphs, {{the maximum}} spanning tree solution cannot be <b>used.</b> <b>Instead,</b> several different algorithms are known; {{the choice of}} which algorithm to use depends on whether a start or destination vertex for the path is fixed, or whether paths for many start or destination vertices must be found simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|In that vein, {{infinite}} matrices {{can also}} be used to describe operators on Hilbert spaces, where convergence and continuity questions arise, which again results in certain constraints that have to be imposed. However, the explicit point of view of matrices tends to obfuscate the matter, and the abstract and more powerful tools of functional analysis can be <b>used</b> <b>instead.</b>|$|E
5|$|Iridium {{is used in}} {{particle}} physics {{for the production of}} antiprotons, a form of antimatter. Antiprotons are made by shooting a high-intensity proton beam at a conversion target, which needs to be made from a very high density material. Although tungsten may be <b>used</b> <b>instead,</b> iridium has the advantage of better stability under the shock waves induced by the temperature rise due to the incident beam.|$|E

5|$|Several design {{proposals}} were submitted, all calling for heavy main guns, between 30.5cm(12in) and 34.3cm(13.5in) calibers. However, financial limitations dictated that smaller, less expensive weaponry would be <b>used</b> <b>instead.</b> The final design therefore {{used the same}} 28cm(11in) double turret introduced {{for the last two}} s— hydraulic elevated Drh LC/1907 instead of electrical elevated Drh LC/1906. In compensation, the design was given a relatively heavy secondary armament.|$|E
