5|$|Amargasaurus is {{classified}} {{as a member of}} the Dicraeosauridae, a family ranked clade within the Diplodocoidea. Currently, this clade consists of five species belonging to four genera. These are, besides Amargasaurus cazaui, the species Dicraeosaurus hansemanni and Dicraeosaurus sattleri from the Late Jurassic Tendaguru beds of Tanzania, as well as Brachytrachelopan mesai from the Late Jurassic of Argentina. Whitlock (2011) argued that Suuwassea emilieae from the Morrison Formation of the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be placed inside the Dicraeosauridae as well, which was supported by subsequent studies. Amargasaurus is the only named dicraeosaurid from the Cretaceous; an unnamed specimen from Brazil indicates that this group persisted until the end of the Early Cretaceous. Most analyses find Dicraeosaurus and Brachytrachelopan to be more closely related to each other than to Amargasaurus. Suuwassea was recovered as the most basal member of the family. A 2015 analysis by Tschopp and colleagues came to the preliminary result that two poorly known genera from the Morrison Formation, Dyslocosaurus polyonychius and Dystrophaeus viaemalae, might be additional members of the Dicraeosauridae.|$|E

5000|$|One of Canada's wrestling exports, Chris Benoit took on Al Snow in what Styles {{predicted}} {{would be}} a fantastic scientific matchup.

Benoit asks the crowd [...] "is this the best the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> offer?" [...] A diving headbutt and powerbomb both garner two counts. Another German suplex gets a nearfall before Snow reverses out of a dragon suplex and into a Snow Plex. Snow is now in control, hitting a superkick for two and an Exploder suplex for a nearfall. Benoit reverses out of another suplex attempt into a German suplex that wipes out both men. Benoit reverses into a dragon suplex and maintains the bridge for the pinfall. Benoit continues his assault after the match and powerbombs Snow, which brings out the medics and Snow has {{to be carried out}} on a stretcher.|$|E

Once the Mexican authorities re-arrest Quintero, the U.S. government has a maximum limit of 60 days to present a formal extradition request. Mexico's Attorney General clarified, however, that if arrested, Caro Quintero cannot be extradited to the United States {{for the murder of}} Camarena because Mexican law prohibits criminals from being tried for the same crime in another country. U.S. lawyers, nonetheless, may argue that Quintero's initial trial was illegitimate {{in the first place and}} that double jeopardy is not applicable. In order for Caro Quintero's extradition to be accepted by Mexico, the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> present other criminal charges and accept that he would not face the death penalty if convicted because there are no laws for capital punishment in Mexico. Following Caro Quintero's release from prison on August 9, he has not been seen in public. There were rumors, however, that he had paid a visit to his hometown of Badiraguato, Sinaloa. Caro Quintero is among the 15 most-wanted fugitives of Interpol. If arrested abroad, he will be immediately extradited to Mexico.|$|E

Jones {{outlines}} an Afghanistan {{foreign policy}} {{strategy for the}} new Trump administration, in the article, “How Trump Should Manage Afghanistan: A Realistic Set of Goals for the New Administration.” (Jones) Jones describes that the current administration faces major issues in Afghanistan. The country is still a vital state in combating the war on terror. Jones discusses that the United States should have a realistic set of goals for Afghanistan. He states, “The United States should thus not expect the Afghan government to defeat the Taliban on the battlefield {{over the next four}} years of the administration. Instead, Washington should set a more realistic goal: to ensure that the Taliban doesn’t win. In order to do this, Washington could take several steps.” (Jones) Jones lays out two main areas the United States should focus on. First, the United States should continue to encourage for governance reform in the country. Past elections have been riddled with corruption. The <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> push to make sure this does not happen. He also determined that the United States should encourage a “diplomatic reconciliation” with the Taliban. The next point Jones makes has to do with the amount of U.S. troops in Afghanistan. General Nicholson has requested, “several thousand additional troops.” (Jones) Jones concludes that this is a reasonable request.|$|E

China needs to contribute more than any other developing country and perhaps as much as industrial countries on market access for manufactured goods. To complete the Doha Round, US officials need Congress to extend trade promotion authority (TPA), but it won't do so unless the Bush administration demonstrates progress in trade talks. TPA is dead unless the Doha Round and big bilateral trade talks promise to deliver a substantial package of reforms in agriculture, manufactures, and services that create trade and investment opportunities for US firms, workers, and farmers. ...|$|E
