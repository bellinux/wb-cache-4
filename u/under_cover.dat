5|$|After Aubers Ridge, {{the corps}} was then rested {{in a quiet}} sector until September, when it {{deployed}} for the Battle of Loos. The initial attack was {{to be made by}} three divisions, with the Meerut Division leading the attack on the Indian front; Blackader's brigade, with two Gurkha battalions and the 2nd Leicesters, was on its right flank. Whilst the attack successfully crossed no-man's land <b>under</b> <b>cover</b> of the barrage, the right flank of the brigade was caught up in defensive wire, and only one battalion successfully made their way into the German trenches; the brigade lost momentum and dug in.|$|E

During this time the Ottoman Army was able to withdraw in good order; the rearguard garrisons retiring <b>under</b> <b>cover</b> of darkness during the night of 8/9 November 1917.|$|E

5|$|American forces {{then began}} {{preparing}} {{to move against}} nearby Kiska island, termed Operation Cottage, the final fight in the Aleutian islands campaign. In August 1943, elements of the 7th Infantry Division took part in an amphibious assault on Kiska with a brigade from the 6th Canadian Infantry Division, {{only to find the}} island deserted by the Japanese. It was later discovered that the Japanese had withdrawn their 5,000-soldier garrison during the night of 28 July, <b>under</b> <b>cover</b> of fog.|$|E
5|$|At 21:00 {{the first}} shells of what {{proved to be}} a two-hour North Korean {{artillery}} and mortar preparation against the American river positions of 2nd Platoon. As the barrage rolled on, North Korean infantry crossed the river and climbed the hills in the darkness <b>under</b> <b>cover</b> of its fire. At 23:00 the barrage lifted and the North Koreans attacked 2nd Platoon, forcing it from the hill after a short fight. Similar assaults took place elsewhere along the battalion outpost line.|$|E
5|$|Cacti {{are often}} grown in greenhouses, {{particularly}} in regions unsuited to {{the cultivation of}} cacti outdoors, such the northern parts of Europe and North America. Here, they may be kept in pots or grown in the ground. Cacti are also grown as houseplants, many being tolerant of the often dry atmosphere. Cacti in pots may be placed outside in the summer to ornament gardens or patios, and then kept <b>under</b> <b>cover</b> during the winter. Less drought-resistant epiphytes, such as epiphyllum hybrids, Schlumbergera (the Thanksgiving or Christmas cactus) and Hatiora (the Easter cactus), are widely cultivated as houseplants.|$|E

5|$|In the East, <b>under</b> <b>cover</b> {{of ground}} fog the field army {{successfully}} {{withdrew from the}} Grebbe Line to the East Front without being bombed as had been feared, and disengaged from the gradually pursuing enemy troops. The new position had some severe drawbacks: the inundations were mostly not yet ready and the earthworks and berms needed because trenches would be flooded in the peat soil {{had not yet been}} constructed, so defences had to be improvised to accommodate the much larger number of troops.|$|E
5|$|In the North, the {{commander}} of 1. Kavalleriedivision, Major General Kurt Feldt, faced the unenviable task of having to advance over the Enclosure Dike {{because of a lack}} of ships. This dam was blocked by the Kornwerderzand Position, which protected a major sluice complex regulating the water level of Lake IJssel, which had to be sufficiently high to allow many Fortress Holland inundations to be maintained. The main fortifications contained 47mm antitank-guns. Long channel piers projected in front of and behind the sluices, on both the right and left; on these, pillboxes had been built which could place a heavy enfilading fire on the dam, which did not provide the slightest cover for any attacker. On 13 May the position was reinforced by a 20mm anti aircraft battery. It had been Feldt's intention to first destroy the position by a battery of siege mortars, but the train transporting it had been blocked on 10 May by a blown railway bridge at Winschoten. Several air attacks on 13 May had little effect; in the late afternoon five bicycle sections tried to approach the main bunker complex <b>under</b> <b>cover</b> of an artillery bombardment, but soon fled after being fired upon; the first was pinned down and could only retreat <b>under</b> <b>cover</b> of darkness, leaving behind some dead.|$|E

Chen's fellow activist Hu Jia stated that Chen had been {{planning}} escape for a long time, and had previously attempted to dig a tunnel for escape.

5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} October 1988, {{in and around}} Los Angeles, California. Shortly {{before the beginning of}} location shooting, Hollywood union truck drivers or teamsters went on strike to protest pay cuts and overtime changes. With deadlines looming, the production searched for non-union drivers, aware that the Teamsters might retaliate by sabotaging equipment or flying airplanes above the filming to ruin audio recordings. After one of the production's camera trucks exploded in the studio parking lot, the non-union drivers headed to Yosemite National Park <b>under</b> <b>cover</b> of darkness with a police escort.|$|E
5|$|The E-boats laid up in {{the shelters}} during the day, safe from air–attack, and put to sea <b>under</b> <b>cover</b> of night to attack Allied shipping. The pens were {{priority}} targets as the torpedo boats they protected were a considerable threat to the supply lines serving Allied forces in western Europe. Since August 1944, the two bunkers had been attacked four times by No. 9 Squadron and No. 617 Squadron of the RAF, {{with a total of}} 53 of the five–ton, Tallboy earthquake bombs. There had been numerous other attacks from bombers carrying smaller, conventional bombs.|$|E
5|$|The first Westbound Pony Express trip left St. Joseph on April 3, 1860 {{and arrived}} {{ten days later}} in San Francisco, California, on April 14.

5|$|The {{sculpture}} {{has been}} used as a backdrop in commercial films, notably in the 2006 Hollywood film The Break-Up, which had to reshoot several scenes because the sculpture was <b>under</b> <b>cover</b> for the initial filming. It is also prominently featured in the ending scene of Source Code. Director Duncan Jones felt the structure was a metaphor for the movie's subject matter and aimed for it to be shown at the beginning and end of the movie. The sculpture served as an aesthetic and symbolic setting for the 2012 film The Vow when the lead characters share a kiss under it.|$|E
5|$|To {{prevent this}} ship {{challenging}} British {{dominance in the}} theatre, the Royal Navy ordered a ship of the line from the Mediterranean fleet to intercept and capture Rivoli on her maiden voyage. Captain John Talbot of HMS Victorious arrived off Venice in mid-February and blockaded the port. When Rivoli attempted to escape <b>under</b> <b>cover</b> of fog, Talbot chased her and forced her to surrender in a five-hour battle, Rivoli losing over half her crew wounded or dead.|$|E
5|$|Wisconsin was {{assigned}} to the 5th Fleet when Admiral Raymond A. Spruance relieved Admiral Halsey as Commander of the Fleet.

As a result, Wisconsin and the other ships shot down 322 enemy planes and destroyed 177 more on the ground. Japanese shipping, both naval and merchant, also suffered drastically, as did hangars and aircraft installations.|$|E
