5|$|On August 21, 1864, the {{soldiers}} began traveling up Fishing Creek. For the next week, they searched the northern portion of Columbia County for deserters and draft evaders. They were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> any, but on August 28 they arrested 100 local citizens. Most were released, although some {{were taken to}} Fort Mifflin. The soldiers continued heading into the northernmost reaches of the Fishing Creek watershed. <b>Unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> any evidence of a conspiracy, they returned to Bloomsburg and remained in the county until December 1864. The last of the prisoners were released from Fort Mifflin several months after their arrest.|$|E

50|$|PC {{versions}} of the game support mouse movement and a new, heavily improved text parser. Mouse movement was still in a primitive state {{at the time of}} the game's release, so Roger is <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> automatically <b>find</b> his way around obstacles in the game world, instead stopping if he encounters a barrier. Computer mice were relatively new at the time, and Sierra's mouse movement would greatly improve in subsequent games.|$|R

50|$|Any-angle path {{planning}} algorithms {{are a subset}} of pathfinding algorithms that search for a path between two points in space and allow the turns in the path to have any angle. The result is a path that goes directly toward the goal and has relatively few turns. Other pathfinding algorithms such as A* constrain the paths to a grid, which produces jagged, indirect paths. Any-angle algorithms are able <b>to</b> <b>find</b> optimal or near-optimal paths by incorporating the any-angle search into the algorithm itself. Algorithms such as A* Post Smoothing that smooth a path found by a grid constrained algorithm are <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> reliably <b>find</b> optimal paths since they cannot change what side of a blocked cell is traversed.|$|R

5|$|Furthermore, while patriarchal {{marriages are}} one of the great wrongs perpetrated upon women, Wollstonecraft argues that a greater wrong is women's lack of independence.

Women such as Jemima are reduced to hard {{physical}} labor, stealing, begging, or prostituting themselves in order to survive; they are demeaned by this work and think meanly of themselves because of it.|$|E

50|$|In his {{commentaries on}} Goethe's {{scientific}} works, written between 1884 and 1897, Steiner presented Goethe's approach to science as essentially phenomenological in nature, rather than theory- or model-based. He developed this conception further in several books, The Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World-Conception (1886) and Goethe's Conception of the World (1897), particularly emphasizing the transformation in Goethe's approach {{from the physical}} sciences, where experiment played the primary role, to plant biology, where both accurate perception and imagination were required <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the biological archetypes (Urpflanze), and postulated that Goethe had sought but been <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> fully <b>find</b> the further transformation in scientific thinking necessary to properly interpret and understand the animal kingdom. Steiner emphasized the role of evolutionary thinking in Goethe's discovery of the intermaxillary bone in human beings; Goethe expected human anatomy to be an evolutionary transformation of animal anatomy.|$|R
40|$|The {{empirical}} {{literature on}} income convergence hypothesis {{is available for}} almost all developed or industrialized countries. However, regarding developing economies especially, South Asian region few studies attempted it in their convergence related empirical analysis. Therefore, the central objective {{of this paper is}} to empirically examine whether or not income convergence is occurring over time in South Asian economies. Furthermore, within Asian block, the study also compares the convergence results of South Asian economies with its parallel East Asian region. The empirical analysis test both absolute convergence hypothesis (using beta and sigma convergence methodologies as well as Theil’s inequality based approach) and conditional convergence hypothesis (by taking care of relevant control variables). These convergence tests are based on conventional regression equation approach by taking real GDP per capita with some explanatory control variables. Both steps employ the pooled cross-section, time series data set, which provides new insights in the convergence tests for real GDP per capita. Although, empirical analysis of this paper is <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>finds</b> any evidence <b>to</b> accept the null hypothesis of the presence of absolute income convergence. However, our results show the presence of conditional income convergence for both East and South Asian economies. It indicates that income gap between these two groups of economies has narrow down conditional based on some common characteristics but it still remains quite large. ...|$|R
