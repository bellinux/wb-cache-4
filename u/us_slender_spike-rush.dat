50|$|The site is of {{interest}} for its diverse flora, in large part down to the varied habitats present within the small area. English Nature's SSSI citation sheet states that 114 species have been found at the site. Two species are present which are rare in Somerset: flatsedge (Blysmus compressus) and <b>slender</b> <b>spike-rush</b> (Eleocharis uniglumis). Flatsedge was discovered here in 1946 by Humphry Bowen. This species occurs at no other site in Somerset. <b>Slender</b> <b>spike-rush</b> was discovered in 1972 by Florence Gravestock, and is only found at one other site in Somerset, West Sedgemoor. Both species were still present in 2004. Other marshland plants found here include purple loosestrife, yellow flag (Iris pseudacorus), hard rush (Juncus inflexus), soft rush (Juncus effusus), flowering rush (Butomus umbellatus), devil's-bit scabious (Succisa pratensis), three species of horsetail Equisetum spp. and seven sedges Carex spp.|$|R

These include cuckoo flower, marsh-marigold, great burnet, meadowsweet, common knapweed, meadow vetchling, marsh ragwort, meadow buttercup, sorrel, ragged-robin, reed canary-grass, sweet vernal-grass and meadow brome. The wet conditions encourage many sedges including brown sedge, oval sedge, yellow sedge and carnation sedge. The <b>slender</b> <b>spike-rush</b> (Eleocharis uniglumis) grows in this meadow which is rare in Gloucestershire.|$|R

40|$|Description: Rhizomatous, mat-forming perennial; culms terete or {{usually with}} 4 - 5 ({{sometimes}} 6) angles; 5 - 90 cm tall; leaves: distal leaf sheaths persistent, proximally red or sometimes yellow-brown; leaf apex often reddish. Spikelets ovoid, 3 - 6 x 1. 5 - 2 mm, apex obtuse to acute. Achenes a lemon or dark yellow, medium brown, or green color falling with or before scales; trigonous; tubercles brown, pyramidal (Flora of North America Committee 2002). There are three varieties: E. tenuis var. tenuis, var. pseudoptera, & var. verrucosa. Differences {{between the three}} varieties {{are based on the}} structure of the culms, color and structure of the achene, and the shape of the tubercle. Flowering: May to late-June Fruiting: mid-June to late July. Similar Species: Eleocharis tenuis is similar to other <b>slender,</b> rhizomatous <b>spike-rushes</b> and mature specimens are needed for proper identification. Eleocharis tenuis is often confused with E. erythropoda and E. elliptica and occasionally E. compressa. It differs from E. erythropoda by its trifid style, smooth achenes, and culms. E. tenuis differs from E. elliptica by culms being 4 - 5 angled compared to 6 - 10 angled of E. elliptica and the achenes of E. tenuis falling with or before the subtending scales compared to the achenes persisting after the scales fall off of E. elliptica. Eleocharis elliptica occurs in primarily alkaline wetlands such as fens and twig-rush wet meadows in the Oak Openings region. Eleocharis compressa differs from E. tenuis in having flattened, often twisted culms and occurring in alkaline wetlands...|$|R

'The {{commodities}} that substantially {{contribute to}} the subsistence {{of the human species}} form a very short catalogue: they demand from <b>us</b> but a <b>slender</b> portion of industry. If these only were produced, and sufficiently produced, the species of man would be continued. If the labour necessarily required to produce them were equitably divided among the poor, and, still more, if it were equitably divided among all, each man's share of labour would be light, and his portion of leisure would be ample. There was a time when this leisure would have been of small comparative value: it is to be hoped that the time will come when it will be applied to the most important purposes. Those hours which are not required for the production of the necessaries of life may be devoted to the cultivation of the understanding, the enlarging our stock of knowledge, the refining our taste, and thus opening to us new and more exquisite sources of enjoyment.|$|R
40|$|Endemic to Oregon in {{the northwestern}} <b>US,</b> the Oregon <b>slender</b> {{salamander}} (Batrachoseps wrighti = B. wrightorum) is a terrestrial plethodontid found associated with late successional mesic forests. Consequently, forest management practices such as timber harvesting may impact their persistence. Therefore, to infer possible future effects of these practices on population structure and differentiation, we used mitochondrial DNA sequences (cytochrome b) and RAPD markers to analyze 22 populations across their range. Phylogenetic analyses of sequence data (774 bp) revealed two historical lineages corresponding to northern and southern-distributed populations. Relationships among haplotypes and haplotype diversity within lineages suggested that the northern region may have more recently been colonized compared to the southern region. In contrast to the mitochondrial data, analyses of 46 RAPD loci suggested an overall pattern of isolation-by-distance in the set of populations examined and no particularly strong clustering of populations based on genetic distances. We propose two non-exclusive hypotheses to account for discrepancies between mitochondrial and nuclear data sets. First, our data may reflect an overall ancestral pattern of isolation-by-distance that has subsequently been influenced by vicariance. Alternately, our analyses may suggest that male-mediated gene flow and female philopatry are important contributors to the pattern of genetic diversity. We discuss the importance of distinguishing between these two hypotheses {{for the purposes of}} identifying conservation units and note that, regardless of the relative contribution of each mechanism towards the observed pattern of diversity, protection of habitat will likely prove critical for the long-term persistence of this species...|$|R
60|$|John La Farge became at once, in {{breaking}} on our view, quite {{the most interesting}} person we knew, {{and for a time}} remained so; he became a great many other things beside--a character, above all, if there ever was one; but he opened up to us, though perhaps to me in particular, who could absorb all that was given me on those suggestive lines, prospects and possibilities that made the future flush and swarm. His foreignness, which seemed great at that time, had gained a sharper accent from a long stay made in France, where both on his father's and his mother's side he had relations, and had found, to our hovering envy, all sorts of charming occasions. He had spent much time in Brittany, among kindred the most romantically interesting, people and places whose very names, the De Nanteuils of Saint-Pol-de-Léon, I seem to remember for instance, cast a spell across comparatively blank Newport sands; he had brought home with him innumerable water-colour sketches, Breton peasants, costumes, interiors, bits of villages and landscape; and I supposed him to have had on such ground the most delightful adventure in the world. How was one not to suppose it {{at a time when the}} best of one's education, such as that was, had begun to proceed almost altogether by the aid of the Revue des Deux Mondes, a periodical that supplied to us then and for several years after (or again I can but speak for myself) all that was finest in the furniture and the fittings of romance? Those beginnings of Newport were our first contact with New England--a New England already comparatively subdued and sophisticated, a Samson shorn of his strength by the shears of the Southern, and more particularly of the New York, Delilah; the result of which, still speaking for myself, was a prompt yearning and reaching out, on the part of the spirit, for some corrective or antidote to whatever it was that might be going, in the season to come, least charmingly or informingly or inspiringly to press upon us. I well recall my small anxious foresight as to a required, an indispensable provision against either assault or dearth, as if the question might be of standing an indefinite siege; and how a certain particular capacious closet in a house we were presently to occupy took on to my fond fancy the likeness at once of a store of edibles, both substantial and succulent, and of a hoard of ammunition for the defence of any breach--the Revue accumulating on its shelves at last in serried rows and really building up beneath <b>us</b> with its <b>slender</b> firm salmon-coloured blocks an alternative sphere of habitation. There will be more to say of this, bristling or rather flowering with precious particulars, if I stray so far; but the point for the moment was that one would have pushed into that world of the closet, one would have wandered or stumbled about in it quite alone if it hadn't been that La Farge was somehow always in it with us. That was in those years his admirable function and touch--that he affected me as knowing his way there as absolutely no one else did, and even as having risen of a sudden before us to bear us this quickening company. Nobody else, not another creature, was free of it to that tune; the whole mid-century New England--as a rough expression of what the general consciousness most signified--was utterly out of it; which made, you see, a most unequal division of our little working, or our totally cogitative, universe into the wondrous esoteric quarter peopled just by us and our friend and our common references, and the vast remainder of the public at large, the public of the innumerably uninitiated even when apparently of the most associated.|$|R
