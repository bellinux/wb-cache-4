5|$|Sustainable use of {{materials}} has targeted {{the idea of}} dematerialization, converting the linear path {{of materials}} (extraction, use, disposal in landfill) to a circular material flow that reuses materials as much as possible, much like the cycling and reuse of waste in nature. This approach is supported by product stewardship and the increasing <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> flow analysis at all levels, especially individual countries and the global economy. The use of sustainable biomaterials that come from renewable sources {{and that can be}} recycled is preferred to the use on non-renewables from a life cycle standpoint.|$|E

40|$|The <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> is studied broadly, {{because of}} the {{environmental}} problems related to extraction, production, consumption and waste treatment. The <b>use</b> and substitution <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> in products is therefore {{a relevant issue for}} environmental policy making. Studies have been done to describe the material flow or to measure the impact <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> or products on the environment. However, these studies do not often consider economic, substitution and dynamic aspects <b>of</b> <b>material</b> flows. Other studies on material flows analyse the relationship between the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> and economic growth, but they do not consider substitution between materials. For environmental policy making economic, technological and environmental aspects <b>of</b> the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> need to be considered. Especially, substitution <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> is important. In various countries material and product policies are imposed on a variety <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> and products. For evaluation of these policies their environmental and economic effects need to be examined in detail. This study aims to analyse the economic and technological factors influencing the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> and the substitution between different materials dynamically. The goal is to obtain an insight in the effect that material levies may have on the <b>use</b> and substitution <b>of</b> <b>materials.</b> The statistical analysis is performed on a specific product-group because decisions on the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> are taken on a product-level.

25|$|The {{purpose of}} {{archaeology}} {{is to learn}} more about past societies and the development of the human race. Over 99% of the development of humanity has occurred within prehistoric cultures, who did not make use of writing, thereby no written records exist for study purposes. Without such written sources, the only way to understand prehistoric societies is through archaeology. Because archaeology is the study of past human activity, it stretches back to about 2.5 million years ago when we find the first stone tools - The Oldowan Industry. Many important developments in human history occurred during prehistory, such as the evolution of humanity during the Paleolithic period, when the hominins developed from the australopithecines in Africa and eventually into modern Homo sapiens. Archaeology also sheds light on many of humanity's technological advances, for instance the ability to use fire, the development of stone tools, the discovery of metallurgy, the beginnings of religion and the creation of agriculture. Without archaeology, we would know little or nothing about the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> culture by humanity that pre-dates writing.|$|E
500|$|An earlier vessel, {{also named}} Brennus, was {{laid down in}} 1884 and {{cancelled}} under the tenure of Admiral Théophile Aube. The vessel, along with a sister ship named Charles Martel, was {{a modified version of}} the [...] ironclad battleships. After Aube's retirement, the plans for the ships were reworked entirely for the ships actually completed, though they are sometimes conflated with the earlier, cancelled vessels. This confusion may be a result of the same shipyard working on both of the ships named Brennus, along with <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> assembled for the first vessel to build the second. The two pairs of ships were, nevertheless, distinct vessels. The second Brennus was ordered in 1888.|$|E
500|$|Throughout 1943, {{implosion}} {{was considered}} a backup project in case the gun-type proved impractical for some reason. Theoretical physicists like Bethe, Oppenheimer and Teller were intrigued {{by the idea of}} a design of an atomic bomb that made more efficient use of fissile material, and permitted the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> of lower purity. These were advantages of particular attraction to Groves. But while Neddermeyer's 1943 and early 1944 investigations into implosion showed promise, {{it was clear that the}} problem would be much more difficult from a theoretical and engineering perspective than the gun design. In July 1943, Oppenheimer wrote to John von Neumann, asking for his help, and suggesting that he visit Los Alamos where he could get [...] "a better idea of this somewhat Buck Rogers project".|$|E

500|$|It {{has become}} evident {{in recent years}} that there is a {{disparity}} between what is deemed to be offensive under the Act and what would be regarded as offensive by a significant proportion of the general public. This {{may be due to the}} age of the law or an indication that the UK has become a diverse and multicultural society. In 1996 there were 562 cases brought, in which 324 individuals were convicted. Even with this small number of trials, a third of convictions resulted in prison sentences, and only a small number of cases went to jury trials. The number of prosecutions has fallen, from 309 in 1994, 131 in 1999, 39 in 2003 to 35 in 2005. This decline may be partly due to the behaviour of modern jurors, who are less likely to consider material as depraving and corrupting, and are reluctant to convict defendants for the private <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> amongst consenting adults. Another reason for the decline may be the range of alternative legislation which can now often be used in place of the Act. Suggestions given by the Crown Prosecution Service include: ...|$|E

60|$|I {{have not}} thought of many details. But here are a few. Take the bath-room, for instance. It shall be as {{beautiful}} as any room in the house, just as it will be as useful. The chance is, {{that it will be}} the most expensive room in the house. Upon that we are resolved--even if we are compelled to build it first, and to live in a tent till we can get more money to go on {{with the rest of the}} house. In the bath-room no delights of the bath shall be lacking. Also, a large part of the expensiveness will be due to the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> that will make it easy to keep the bathroom clean and in order. Why should a servant toil unduly that my body may be clean? On the other hand, the honesty of my own flesh, and the square dealing I give it, are more important than all the admiration of my friends for expensive decorative schemes and magnificent trivialities. More delightful to me is a body that sings than a stately and costly grand staircase built for show. Not that I like grand staircases less, but that I like bath-rooms more.|$|E
6000|$|Let {{the reader}} take a pen {{in hand and}} sit down and write, [...] "My very dear wife." [...] Clean, cold, and correct this is, {{speaking}} of orderly affection, settled and stereotyped long ago. In such letters is butcher's meat also [...] "very dear." [...] Try now, [...] "Migh verrie deare Wyfe." [...] Is it not immediately infinitely more soft and tender? Is there not something exquisitely pleasant in lingering over those redundant letters, leaving each word, as it were, with a reluctant caress? Such spelling is a soft, domestic, lovingly wasteful <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>material.</b> Or, again, {{if you have no}} wife, or object to an old-fashioned conjugal tenderness, try [...] "Mye owne sweete dearrest Marrie." [...] There is the tremble of a tenderness no mere arrangement of trim everyday letters can express in those double r's. [...] "Sweete" [...] my ladie must be; sweet! why pump-water and inferior champagne, spirits of nitrous ether and pancreatic juice are [...] "sweet." [...] For my own part I always spell so, with lots of f's and g's and such like tailey, twirley, loopey things, when my heart is in the tender vein. And I hold that a man who will not do so, now he has been shown how to do it, is, in plain English, neither more nor less than a prig. The advantages of a varied spelling of names are very great. Industrious, rather than intelligent, people have given not a little time, and such minds as they have, to the discussion of the right spelling of our great poet's name. But he himself never dreamt of tying himself down to one presentation of himself, and was--we have his hand for it--Shakespeare, Shakspear, Shakespear, Shakspeare, and so forth, as the mood might be. It would be almost as reasonable to debate whether Shakespeare smiled or frowned. My dear friend Simmongues is the same. He is [...] "Sims," [...] a mere slash of the pen, to those he scorns, Simmonds or Simmongs to his familiars, and Simmons, A.T. Simmons, Esq., to all Europe.|$|E
