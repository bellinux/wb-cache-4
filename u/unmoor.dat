60|$|Talcott {{came to call}} me, at the {{indicated}} moment.

But, drunkards do tolerably well on board a ship in which reasonable discipline is maintained. For that matter, Neptune ought to be a profound moralist, as youths are very generally sent to sea to cure most of the ethical flings. Talcott was directed to <b>unmoor,</b> and heave short. As for myself, I got into a boat and pulled ashore, with an intention of making a last and strong appeal to Marble.|$|E

60|$|It {{sprung up}} a fresh gale {{in the evening}} at S.W. by W., which, being fair for the Portugal fleet, and the weather {{pleasant}} and agreeable, we heard the signal given to <b>unmoor,</b> and running in under the island of Si---, we hauled our mainsail and foresail up in the brails, lowered the topsails upon the cap, and clewed them up, that we might lie as snug as we could, expecting their coming out, {{and the next morning}} saw the whole fleet come out accordingly, but not at all to our satisfaction, for they consisted of twenty-six sail, and most of them ships of force, as well as burthen, both merchantmen and men-of-war; so, seeing there was no meddling, we lay still where we were also, till the fleet was out of sight, and then stood off and on, in hopes of meeting with further purchase.|$|E
60|$|I {{left the}} {{supercargo}} and my mate, also a kinsman of my own, a true sailor, {{who had been}} a midshipman, but was now a lieutenant; I say, to those I left the command of both my ships, but with express orders not to stir nor <b>unmoor,</b> upon any account whatever, unavoidable accidents excepted, until my return, or until, if I should die, they should hear of that event; no, though they were to stay there six months, for they had provisions enough, and an excellent place for watering lay just by them. And I made all the men swear to me that they would make no mutiny or disorder, but obey my said kinsman in one ship, and the supercargo in the other, in all things, except removing from that place; and that, if they should command them to stir from thence, they would not so much as touch a sail or a rope for the purpose.|$|E
60|$|Some hot-heads {{would have}} urged an attempt against all such array of force, but Lord Loudoun {{was aware of}} the {{probability}} of defeat, and the disgrace and ruin that it would bring upon British arms in America. He wisely, though ingloriously, returned to New York. Admiral Holbourne made a silly demonstration of his fleet off the harbor of Louisburg, approaching within two miles of the batteries, but retired on seeing the French admiral preparing to <b>unmoor.</b> He afterwards returned with a reinforcement of four ships of the line; cruised before Louisburg, endeavoring to draw the enemy to an engagement, which De la Mothe had the wisdom to decline; was overtaken by a hurricane, in which one of his ships was lost, eleven were dismasted, others had to throw their guns overboard, and all returned in a shattered condition to England. Thus ended the northern campaign by land and sea, a subject of great mortification to the nation, and ridicule and triumph to the enemy.|$|E

60|$|Oh, grassy glades! oh ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul; in ye,--though long parched by {{the dead}} drought of the earthly life,-- in ye, men yet may roll, like young horses in new morning clover; {{and for some}} few {{fleeting}} moments, feel the cool dew of the life immortal on them. Would to God these blessed calms would last. But the mingled, mingling threads of life are woven by warp and woof: calms crossed by storms, a storm for every calm. There is no steady unretracing progress in this life; we do not advance through fixed gradations, and at the last one pause:-- through infancy's unconscious spell, boyhood's thoughtless faith, adolescence' doubt (the common doom), then scepticism, then disbelief, resting at last in manhood's pondering repose of If. But once gone through, we trace the round again; and are infants, boys, and men, and Ifs eternally. Where lies the final harbor, whence we <b>unmoor</b> no more? In what rapt ether sails the world, of which the weariest will never weary? Where is the foundling's father hidden? Our souls are like those orphans whose unwedded mothers die in bearing them: the secret of our paternity lies in their grave, and we must there to learn it.|$|E

"I should think, Egbert, that if {{we could}} get some skins or planks we and our band might, when it is quite dark, sally out and take to the water {{at the lower end of}} the island and float down quietly for a mile or two, and then gain the further bank; then we might march along quietly until we reach those ships. The Danes know that we have no boats, and will not fear an attack. We must not do it until an hour or two before morning, when, after {{spending}} the early hours of the night as usual in feasting and drinking, they will sleep heavily. Just before we are ready to begin a small party can <b>unmoor</b> two or three of the boats by the bank and push them out, one to the outside of each tier of six vessels, so that we may have a means of retreat across the river. When that is done we will make a rush on board the ships, cut down any Danes we may find there, and set fire to all the vessels. We must hold the gangways to the shore until the flames get well alight, and then take to the boats and return." ...|$|E
60|$|The wind being now N.W., {{the sea was}} {{considerably}} run down, and this morning at five o'clock the landing-master's crew, thirteen in number, left the tender; and having now no detention with the landing of artificers, they proceeded to <b>unmoor</b> the Hedderwick praam-boat, and towed her alongside of the Smeaton: {{and in the course}} of the day twenty-three blocks of stone, three casks of pozzolano, three of sand, three of lime, and one of Roman cement, together with three bundles of trenails and three of wedges, were all landed on the rock and raised to the top of the building by means of the tackle suspended from the cross-beam on the middle of the bridge. The stones were then moved along the bridge on the waggon to the building within reach of the balance-crane, with which they were laid in their respective places on the building. The masons immediately thereafter proceeded to bore the trenail-holes into the course below, and otherwise to complete the one in hand. When the first stone was to be suspended by the balance-crane, the bell on the beacon was rung, and all the artificers and seamen were collected on the building. Three hearty cheers were given while it was lowered into its place, and the steward served round a glass of rum, when success was drunk to the further progress of the building.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the experience of}} <b>unmoored</b> multilingualism through autoethnographic reflection, literary fiction, and anthropological inquiry. Drawing {{from the work of}} Elaine Scarry, Simone Weil, Anne Carson, and Tim Ingold, Phipps contemplates the embodied relationship between pain and languages, movement, and the porosity of language worlds. Phipp’s exploration of these abstract concepts is shaped by a collage of voices from asylum seekers, refugees and their advocates, and through the voices of fiction, which tell of pain and porosity in <b>unmoored</b> languages. In particular, the paper draws from Barbara Kingsolver’s novel The Poisonwood Bible and Camilla Gibb’s Sweetness in the Belly, as well as from Phipp’s own personal experiences...|$|R

6000|$|Master Landry took me {{down and}} settled it all with the master, a French farmer fellow that came a horse-dealing to Paris. I knew what my young Lord was after, {{but none of the}} other varlets did; and I went down and made as decent a place as I could between decks. My Lord and Master Landry were gone down to the court meantime, and we were to lie off till we heard a whistle like a mavis on the bank, then come and take them aboard. Well, we waited and waited, and all the lights were out, and not a sound did we hear till just an hour after midnight. Then a big bell rang out, not like a decent Christianable bell, but a great clash, then another, and a lot of strokes enough to take away one's breath. Then half the windows were lighted up, and we heard shots, and screeches, and {{splashes}}, till, as I said to Jack Smithers, 'twas as if one half the place was murthering the other. The farmer got frightened, and would have been off; but when I saw what he was at, [...] "No," [...] says I, [...] "not an inch do we budge without news of my Lord." [...] So Jack stood by the rope, and let them see that 'twas as much as their life was worth to try to <b>unmoor.</b> Mercy, what a night it was! Shrieks and shouts, and shots and howls, here, there, and everywhere, and splashes into the rive; and by and by we saw the poor murthered creatures come floating by. The farmer, he had some words with one of the boats near, and I heard somewhat of Huguenot and Hereteek, and I knew that was what they called good Protestants. Then up comes the farmer with his sons looking mighty ugly at us, and signing that unless we let them be off 'twould be set ashore for us; and we began to think as how we had best be set ashore, and go down the five of us {{to see if we could}} stand by my young Lord in some strait, or give notice to my Lord Ambassador.' ...|$|E
5000|$|The North American {{leg of the}} Dangerous Woman Tour {{received}} mostly positive reviews. In {{a positive}} review of the Las Vegas concert for Las Vegas Weekly, Ian Caramanzana wrote: [...] "Grande’s burly, soulful vibrato and wide range remain the star of her show, and shes at her best when its just her, a microphone and her band - especially when she performs ballads". Ed Masley commented for The Arizona Republic that Grande has grown [...] "into a self-assured R&B diva with the vocal chops {{to back up the}} confident swagger she brought to the stage. ... Vocally, Grande exuded more power and passion than ever, especially on the ballads". In another positive review, Jon Pareles of The New York Times praised Grande for not resorting to shock value. He described the concert as [...] "a show of confidence, prowess and aplomb", and goes on to say [...] "Onstage, Ms. Grande, a former child star who got national exposure on Nickelodeon, flaunts professionalism, not skin or profanities". The Guardians writer credited as [...] "Kitty Empire" [...] praised Grande as vocalist writing [...] "Grandes four-octave soprano has been confirmed as a force of nature" [...] and expressed a positive opinion about the concept and design of the show: [...] "thank goodness there are costume changes for respite - four, in which she wears black, grey, white and black again - or Grande’s ponytail might <b>unmoor</b> itself like a champagne cork." [...] Similarly, Chris Kelly of The Washington Post wrote, [...] "her gorgeous four-octave soprano was often obscured by her bass-heavy backing band" [...] while described the show as [...] "a pristine showcase of her immense vocal talent." ...|$|E
