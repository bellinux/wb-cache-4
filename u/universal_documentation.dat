5000|$|While the novated lease {{is only a}} part of {{the salary}} {{packaging}} arrangement, the whole arrangement is often described as a [...] "novated lease" [...] even though the term strictly applies only to the lease for the finance of the vehicle which has been novated. This usage of [...] "novated lease" [...] is almost <b>universal</b> on <b>documentation,</b> advertising and the websites of salary packaging companies and leads to confusion about whether it is the whole arrangement or just the lease itself which is meant by the term.|$|R

50|$|The World Congress of <b>Universal</b> <b>Documentation</b> {{was held}} from 16 to 21 August 1937 in Paris, France. Delegates from 45 {{countries}} met to discuss {{means by which}} all of the world's information, in print, in manuscript, and in other forms, could be efficiently organized and made accessible.|$|E
5000|$|The International Centre organises {{collections}} of world-wide importance. These collections are the International Museum, the International Library, the International Bibliographic Catalogue and the Universal Documentary Archives. These collections are conceived {{as parts of}} one <b>universal</b> body of <b>documentation,</b> as an encyclopedic survey of human knowledge, as an enormous intellectual warehouse of books, documents, catalogues and scientific objects. Established according to standardised methods, they are formed by assembling cooperative everything that the participating associations may gather or classify. Closely consolidated and coordinated in all of their parts and enriched by duplicates of all private works wherever undertaken, these collections will tend progressively to constitute a permanent and complete representation of the entire world (Union of International Associations, 1914, p. 116).|$|R
40|$|The work of documenting and conserving {{endangered}} languages {{is complicated}} by the presence of multiple dialects. How (sometimes, if) to represent dialectal variation in language descriptions and education programs is an important question. The author examines these issues through the lens of field research on Amdo Tibetan since 2008. For researchers interested in exploring questions of typology and linguistic <b>universals,</b> <b>documentation</b> of dialects provides priceless data, but such problems as what features constitute a dialect and who speaks it complicate the task of identifying and collecting data, especially for dialects that are low prestige or are only spoken by diglossic speakers. The field researcher must be alert to the possible existence of such forms and be aware of the issues associated with them. For the conservationist, the linguist’s instinct is to argue that dialects should be preserved as part of the community’s heritage, as well as having value in their own right, but individuals struggling to reverse language shift may feel that the reduction of diversity is a necessary step toward ensuring the survival of the language for future generations. However, the selection of a “standard” form can be problematic, sometimes resulting in conflict within the community or, more seriously, causing some speakers to be excluded from conservation efforts altogether. It behooves conservationists to be aware of community attitudes toward diversity and to try to understand how diversity impacts language use within the community. Spoken by an estimated 1. 5 million people, Amdo Tibetan does not fit the profile of a typical endangered language. However, AT’s status as a minority language and the increasing use of both spoken and written Chinese have already resulted in language shift in some areas, such as the Gro. tshang region of eastern Qinghai Province. The author has observed that efforts to reverse language shift in the area by encouraging literacy in Written Tibetan have been unsuccessful in part because literacy teachers don’t speak the Gro. tshang dialect. At the same time, negative attitudes toward the Gro. tshang dialect discourage some speakers from using Tibetan with people from other regions, contributing to the mistaken belief throughout Amdo that Gro. tshang Tibetans speak only Chinese. Part of the blame for this belief, however, also lies in the relatively high level of unintelligibility of Gro. tshang Tibetan with other AT dialects, and many language activists and Gro. tshang residents see dialect diversity as an obstacle to preserving Tibetan as the language of Gro. tshang Tibetans...|$|R
40|$|Documentation is an {{essential}} component of good data management and yet data service providers often struggle to provide effective support to researchers. There are materials available for creating or assisting researchers with documentation {{at the beginning and end}} of a project; from data management plans to documenting data for archival purposes. However, we don’t yet have a solid understanding of how research teams incorporate (or not) documentation into their everyday work. This poster reports on a project to investigate, analyze, and synthesize real and ideal documentation practices within research teams in order to develop a <b>universal</b> project manual <b>documentation</b> template. It is our contention that a “lab manual” or “project organization protocol” will enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of research teams, while creating an inclusive environment by making local practices and expectations clear to all team members regardless of previous research experience and disciplinary background. The goal of this project is to identify the basic considerations that any researcher from any discipline should consider for their local documentation in support of team-based research projects...|$|R

50|$|Morris {{devised a}} system of {{movement}} notation which {{was first published in}} 1928, the same year as the Laban system. Initially Morris was inspired by the shorthand system devised by Raymond Duncan, brother of Isadora Duncan, but soon realised the limitations of such an approach for comprehensive documentation. The system she later referred to as 'Danscript' was hugely comprehensive and was intended for the <b>universal</b> <b>documentation</b> of human movement. It featured in Choreo-graphics (Hutchinson Guest) and was referenced in The Dancing Times.|$|E
50|$|In 1925 Goldberg {{demonstrated}} {{and published}} a technique for making microdot (Mikrat nach Goldberg) at a resolution {{equivalent to the}} text 50 complete Bibles per square inch. This invention has been widely attributed to a mythical “Professor Zapp” based on J. Edgar Hoover’s erroneous article in the April 1946 Readers Digest, probably a confusion with Kurt Zapp who trained German spies in microdot photography during the Second World War. In 1937, Goldberg presented a paper at the World Congress of <b>Universal</b> <b>Documentation</b> on an early copying camera he had invented.|$|E
40|$|Taiwan is an {{important}} trading and maritime channels for many countries since ancient time. Numerous relics lie underwater due to weather, wars, and other factors. In the year of 2006, Bureau of Cultural Heritage (BOCH) entrusted the Underwater Archaeological Team of Academia Sinica to execute the underwater archaeological investigation projects. Currently, we verified 78 underwater targets, with 78 site of those had been recognized as shipwrecks sites. Up to date, there {{is a collection of}} 638 underwater objects from different underwater archaeological sites. Those artefacts are distributed to different institutions and museums. As very diverse management methods/systems are applied for every individual institution, underwater cultural heritage data such as survey, excavation report, research, etc. are poorly organized and disseminated for use. For better communication regarding to Taiwan’s underwater cultural heritage in every level, a <b>universal</b> format of <b>documentation</b> should be established. By comparing the existing checklist used in Taiwan with guidelines that are followed in other countries, a more intact and appropriate underwater cultural heritage condition documentation system can be established and adapted in Taiwan...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{tremendous}} {{information sources}} are preserved, ranging {{from those of}} a traditional nature like libraries and museums to new formats like electronic databases and the World Wide Web. Making these sources consistent, easily accessible, and as complete as possible is challenging. Almost a century ago, people like Paul Otlet were already fully aware of this need and tried to develop ways of making human knowledge more accessible using the resources and technol-ogy available at that time. Otlet’s ideas about a <b>Universal</b> Network of <b>Documentation</b> and the <b>Universal</b> Book are clear examples of such efforts. Computer science currently provides the means to build digital spaces that consist of (multimedia) information sources con-nected through the Internet. In this article, we give a nontechnical overview of {{the current state of}} the art in information management. Next, we focus on those aspects of Otlet’s work that deal with the organization of knowledge and information sources. Then we study the potential connections between Otlet’s work and the state of the art of computerized information management from a computer scientist’s point of view. Finally, we consider some of the problems and challenges that information management still faces today and what computer science professionals have in common with, and can still learn from, Otlet and his work...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{introduces a}} novel automated book reader as an assistive technology tool {{for persons with}} blindness. The literature shows extensive work {{in the area of}} optical character recognition, but the current methodologies available for the automated reading of books or bound volumes remain inadequate and are severely constrained during document scanning or image acquisition processes. The goal of the book reader design is to automate and simplify the task of reading a book while providing a user-friendly environment with a realistic but affordable system design. This design responds to the main concerns of (a) providing a method of image acquisition that maintains the integrity of the source (b) overcoming optical character recognition errors created by inherent imaging issues such as curvature effects and barrel distortion, and (c) determining a suitable method for accurate recognition of characters that yields an interface with the ability to read from any open book with a high reading accuracy nearing 98 %. This research endeavor focuses in its initial aim on the development of an assistive technology tool to help persons with blindness in the reading of books and other bound volumes. But its secondary and broader aim is to also find in this design the perfect platform for the digitization process of bound documentation in line with the mission of the Open Content Alliance (OCA), a nonprofit Alliance at making reading materials available in digital form. The theoretical perspective of this research relates to the mathematical developments that are made in order to resolve both the inherent distortions due to the properties of the camera lens and the anticipated distortions of the changing page curvature as one leafs through the book. This is evidenced by the significant increase of the recognition rate of characters and a high accuracy read-out through text to speech processing. This reasonably priced interface with its high performance results and its compatibility to any computer or laptop through universal serial bus connectors extends greatly the prospects for <b>universal</b> accessibility to <b>documentation.</b> ...|$|R
50|$|He was {{a member}} of the Belgian {{delegation}} to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 and to the League of Nations Assembly (1920-21). In other efforts to foster world peace, he founded the Centre Intellectuel Mondial (later merged into the League of Nations Institute for Intellectual Co-operation) and proposed such organizations as a world school and university, and a world parliament. In 1907, with Paul Otlet, he founded the Union of International Associations. He also is the co-founder of Institut International de Bibliographie (which later became the International Federation for Information and Documentation, FID) along with Paul Otlet. It was in this role that he and Otlet attended the World Congress of <b>Universal</b> <b>Documentation</b> in 1937.|$|E
5000|$|In August 1937, Watson {{chaired the}} American {{delegation}} to the World Congress of <b>Universal</b> <b>Documentation,</b> held in Paris, France. At that event, Watson touted microfilm as a powerful means of information interchange: [...] "Microfilm will supplement other forms of publication and make accessible material of all sorts that can not now be printed because of economic factors. It will make available out-of-print and rare books. It is adapted to the publication of photographs and other illustrations.... In this way the document is perpetually 'in print' but no extensive, space-consuming stocks need be stored, only the document itself and the microfilm negative from which positives are made for distribution.” He also proposed at this conference that newspapers be archived on microfilm, {{as opposed to being}} stored as physical copies.|$|E

Additions, deletions or changes to support requirements for the ALSEP program shall be made by revision to this document. Revision 2 consists primarily of the deletion of the Particles and Fields Subsatellite (P&FS) support requirements, updates the list of supporting sites and includes provisions for use of recertified magnetic tapes for ALSEP. Additionally, this revision hiis been prepared under guidelines of the <b>Universal</b> <b>Documentation</b> System (UDS) as defined in the Range Commanders Council (RCC) Document 501 - 70, Vol 2, Because of similiarity of forms and content of this Program Requirements Document (PRD) and the previous (but now obsolete) Program Support Requirements Document (PSRD), users will have no difficulty in identifying support requirements or determining {{the changes that have}} been made in this:revision and transition to current forms and directives...|$|E
40|$|Objective: This mixed methods {{continuing}} line {{of inquiry}} was conducted {{in order to identify}} how occupational therapists (OTs) report that sensory spaces are being used in Michigan public school settings. This includes who uses the spaces, what purpose the space serves, and the training that individuals utilizing the spaces have received. Methods: A link to a survey, which was adapted from Abbot, Wills, and Hanert (2015), was posted on the Michigan Alliance of School Physical and Occupational Therapists’ (MASPOT) listServ and Michigan Occupational Therapy Association’s (MiOTA) facebook page in June of 2016 in order to recruit participations. The inclusion criteria for participants included currently practicing school-based OTs, practitioners who treat children with sensory needs, and having access to a designated sensory space. The survey was administered via survey monkey and included twenty-three quantitative questions and five qualitative questions. The survey asked questions that sought to answer the various ways in which school-based OTs in Michigan are using, collaborating within, training in the use of, and supervising the use of sensory spaces in Michigan schools. Results: Survey results revealed that the three primary school personnel who determine which students use the sensory spaces are the OT (100 %), the special education teacher (70 %), and paraprofessionals/aids (35 %). Forty-one percent of participants reported that limited or no documentation system is utilized to record or supervise what occurs in the sensory spaces. Sixty-seven percent of participants stated that they feel sensory spaces are not being used by school personnel the way they are intended to be used. Majority of responses included reports of misuse of the rooms and poor follow through on instructions provided by the OT. Conclusion: OTs receive specialty training that guides the use of school sensory spaces. Participants report that barriers to effective use of sensory rooms include a lack of ongoing communication, supervision, and consistent documentation. The literature supports these concepts and suggests that <b>universal</b> competency trainings, <b>documentation</b> systems, and supervisory processes must be developed and implemented in order to ensure proper and effective use of sensory spaces in schools.

40|$|This thesis {{identifies}} {{and offers}} solutions to many common {{issues and challenges}} facing a U. S. Government weapon system developer conducting a Test and Evaluation program using the Major Range and Test Facility Base. White Sands Missile Range {{was used as an}} example. Common requirements were addressed {{from the perspective of a}} first-time U. S. Government user. The Test and Evaluation process is complicated and requires a good understanding of the Major Range and Test Facility Base structure and basic procedures. This is particularly important for the manager of a relatively small developmental program which does not have an extensive test support infrastructure. Some topics include the Major Range and Test Facility Base organization and responsibilities, White Sands Missile Range organization and capabilities, and the <b>Universal</b> <b>Documentation</b> System. In addition, a presentation of practical lessons-learned from both Major Range and Test Facility Base users and operators provides a valuable resource base for all test program managers...|$|E
40|$|Background: Despite the {{national}} priority to reduce emergency admissions at the EOL, people with life-limiting illnesses are increasingly accessing the ED. There are however concerns that emergency care {{for patients with}} life-limiting illness is inadequate. Understanding staff perspectives of barriers to quality care provision at the EOL in the ED is fundamental in order to recommend improvements for service provision. Methods: Three focus groups were conducted using semi-structured questions, {{based on the results}} of the literature review in the initial phase of the project. Purposive sampling was used as participants needed prior knowledge of palliative care or experience in working in the ED. Number of participants in focus groups ranged from five to nine due to workload demands within the ED on day of focus group. Data analysis was undertaken using Ritchie and Spencer’s (1994) Framework analysis. Results: ED staff identified barriers in the ED that hinder the provision of EOLC. They recommended interventions which they felt could improve care provision; patient pathway, <b>universal</b> <b>documentation</b> and improving education. Overall, participants felt the ED environment was inappropriate to provide EOLC suggesting that the primary function of the ED is not conducive to palliative care. Conclusion: The ED culture does not account for EOLC presenting barriers for patients who attend for palliative emergencies. Within the UK very little attention has been paid to interventions improving EOLC in the ED. Results highlight that interventions to improve EOLC need to consider the organisational culture that exists in the emergency setting; important when considering service provision and improving healthcare...|$|E
