50|$|Mid-Canada Line Site 050 Fort Albany {{was a part}} of the Mid-Canada Line {{air defence}} network.

This consisted of approximately 90 <b>unmanned</b> <b>sites</b> and eight Sector Control Stations located along the 55th parallel. Each site sent out a radio beam to its neighbouring site.

Also, the semi-automated Alaskan NORAD Control Center was replaced with the fully automated Alaska NORAD Region Regional Operations Control Center (ROCC).

This system provides ideal solution for monitoring critical plant on <b>unmanned</b> <b>sites.</b> The system is Wireless [2] therefore more adaptable and cost-effective. Utilizing Humidity sensor HSM- 20 G, ARM Controller LPC 2148 and GSM technology this system offers a cost effective solution to wide range of remote monitoring and control applications. Historical and real time data can be accessed world wide using the GSM network. The system can also be configured to transmit data on alarm or at preset intervals to a mobile phone using SMS text messaging. The proposed system monitors and controls the humidity from the remote location and whenever it crosses the set limit the LPC 2148 processor will sends an SMS to a concerned plant authority(s) mobile phone via GSM network.

5000|$|RCAF Winisk was one {{of eight}} Sector Control Stations on the Mid-Canada Line system of radar stations. [...] Each SCS {{received}} signals {{from a series of}} <b>unmanned</b> detection <b>sites</b> located approximately 50 km apart. In Winisk, radio wave signals were transmitted along the chain of stations to the SCS, then to MCL Site 070 Mount Kempis via tropospheric scatter system and finally to RCAF Station North Bay by land line. As there is no road or rail access to Winisk, an airstrip was also built to serve the base (and still exists on the site).|$|R
50|$|Budget cuts {{forced the}} station to close in 1957. It was then {{replaced}} by an <b>unmanned</b> gap-filler radar <b>site,</b> designated P-34E with an AN/FPS-18 radar, located on the southwest side of the airport. It was operated as such by the 752d Radar Squadron at Empire AFS, Michigan from June 1960 until June 1968.|$|R
50|$|Closed due to {{budgetary}} cuts on 1 November 1957. It {{was scheduled to}} become an <b>unmanned</b> gap-filler radar <b>site</b> P-70A, but did not. On 5 September 1958, the Air Force declared the 12.5-acre site excess and transferred it, along with all buildings and personal property located on the site {{at the time of}} transfer to the GSA.|$|R
50|$|The {{permanent}} site (P-6) {{was moved to}} Bodie Mountain (Curlew AFS) on 1 December 1953, and the 638th AC&W Squadron began operating an AN/FPS-3 long-range search radar and an AN/FPS-5 height-finder radar beginning in January 1952. An AN/FPS-6 height-finder radar was installed in 1957. In 1959 the 638th AC&W Squadron was inactivated, and the station was converted to an <b>unmanned</b> gap-filler radar <b>site</b> (P-60C) to support Colville AFS (P-60) until the site was finally closed in December 1960.|$|R
50|$|The main {{attraction}} of Waiouru is the Queen Elizabeth II Army Memorial Museum, opened in 1978, which features static displays of New Zealand's military heritage. The {{rest of the}} township consists of a small cluster of a police station, two garages, a petrol station/postal agency, a panel beater, two motels, a tavern {{and half a dozen}} cafe/restaurants spread along the highway. There are three <b>unmanned</b> diesel refueling <b>sites</b> for the 700+ big freight trucks that pass through Waiouru each day. Nearby are the yards of a roading contractor and a maintenance contractor. A grocery store, hairdresser and beautician are in the Army housing area two kilometres away, and a medical centre, public library, cafe and department store are inside the army camp.|$|R
5000|$|The 680th AC&W Squadron was inactivated on 1 July 1960—reactivated in 1961 as the 680th Radar Squadron (SAGE) at Palermo AFS, New Jersey (site Z-54)—and Yaak AFS was {{converted}} into an <b>unmanned</b> gap-filler radar <b>site</b> in 1960 and redesignated SM-151E, first {{operated by the}} 823d Radar Squadron at Mica Peak AFS, Washington, then the 716th Radar Squadron at Kalispell AFS, Montana (TM-179B). The radar station was declared excess by the Air Force to GSA in 1960 and 1961, and a 90.0 acre portion was transferred by special use permit in early 1962 to the Forest service for ingress and egress to the Yaak Mountain Lookout Tower (not located on the FUDS.) The main portion of the station was transferred by the Corps of Engineers to the Forest Service in 1965 (metal rubble from building demolition was located on the FUDS.) ...|$|R
40|$|In late 2013, a joint archaeological and {{computer}} vision project was initiated to digitally capture the archaeological {{remains in the}} al-Ula valley, Saudi Arabia. The goal of our team of archeologists {{and computer}} scientists is to integrate 3 D scanning technologies to produce 3 D reconstructions of archaeological <b>sites.</b> <b>Unmanned</b> Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) serve as the vehicle which makes this scanning possible. UAVs allow the acquisition of 3 D data as easily from the air as from the ground. This project focuses on the recent excavations carried out in ancient Dedan by King Saud University and the country's conservation of the Lihyanite "lion tombs" carved into the ancient city's cliff faces. Over {{the next several years}} this site will be used as a test bed to validate the potential of this emerging technology for rapid cultural heritage documentation.
