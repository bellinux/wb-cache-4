40|$|In metals {{ultrasonic}} waves attenuate {{in different}} ways. The attenuation {{can be divided}} in different categories: geometrical attenuation due to beam spreading due to the finite aperture of the transducer, scattering, and absorption. The scattering is caused mainly by grain boundary scattering and thus the grain size affects strongly the attenuation. Both the average grain size {{and the distribution of}} grain size have to be taken into account. Additionally the surface finish of the component affects amplitude variations in <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>inspections.</b> Not only the RMS-value of the surface roughness does play a role but also the form of roughness. This is not often recognized in inspections. Also the stress state of the component will affect the attenuation of ultrasonic waves mainly via the absorptive part (i. e. internal friction) of the material. In the copper components examined here, the grain size can vary locally between 50 µm to 2000 µm. Due to this large variation in the grain size distribution, the ultrasonic testing demands greater efforts than in normal polycrystalline materials, where the grain size is small compared to the ultrasonic wavelength.
