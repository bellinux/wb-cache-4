25|$|The {{preliminary}} {{plans for}} the bridge featured a 3-lane roadway, a railroad crossing on the <b>underdeck</b> of the span, and a center-anchorage double-suspension bridge configuration similar {{to the design of}} the San Francisco– Oakland Bay Bridge. Because this would have required sinking an anchorage pier in the deepest area of the Straits, the practicality of this design may have been questionable. A concrete causeway, approximately , extending from the northern shore, was constructed in shallow water from 1939 to 1941. However, a unique engineering challenge was created by the tremendous forces that operate against the base of the bridge, because the lakes freeze during the winter, causing large icebergs to place enormous stress on the bridge.|$|E

5000|$|Because {{the primary}} cables cannot be {{anchored}} until the bridge deck is completed, a self-anchored suspension bridge requires some falsework during construction. This falsework {{may take the}} form of compression struts (pictured here http://pghbridges.com/pittsburghW/0584-4477/7th1927clpgh1.jpg and in the above diagram) which hold up the main cables (or the parts of them which have already been constructed), allowing the ends of the span to be constructed first in the fashion of a cantilever bridge, or it may be in the form of <b>underdeck</b> falsework, as was employed in the Eastern span replacement of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge ...|$|E

40|$|Head seas {{slamming}} {{tests have}} been carried out on a scale model of a Canadian SWATH design in the IMD towing tank. Relative performance of a commercially available rubber cushion material for its ability to absorb wave impact force and acceleration on the cross-deck has been examined. Contrary to expectations, results did not seem to suggest any reduction in impact force over the bare hull (<b>underdeck)</b> tests. However, the rubber cladding did help in cushioning the deck acceleration consistently. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that ageing steel marine {{structures}} are susceptible to corrosion in its all manifestations. The most critical areas are cargo and ballast tanks of merchant ships. However, due to the regulations such as the Performance Standard for Protective Coatings, which requires a 15 -year target life of coating in ballast tanks, plus the cathodic protection systems, the internal structures within cargo holds have become more problematic but poorly studied. In the <b>underdeck</b> area and bottom plating, the structures are not normally fully protected. Also, the complex structural arrangement may place difficulties in inspection and repair. In extreme cases, {{it has been reported that}} the corrosion rate in these areas could be 5 to 7 times higher than a normal value, and has led to catastrophic structural failures. Currently, the classification societies apply both visual and gauging methods for corrosion inspection during ship surveys. However, it is time consuming especially for large vessels and is highly experience dependent. Therefore, to improve the survey efficiency, facilitate economical maintenance decisions, and even extend the structural life, it is essential to investigate the ultimate strength of such aged and corroded steel structures. Based on the identification of existing corrosion issues in cargo tanks of oil tankers and bulk carriers and the state-of-art of corroded marine structural strength assessments, a nonlinear finite element method was adopted to investigate the influences of pitting and grooving corrosion on the structural integrity. Two full-field experimental techniques were used for a complete validation of the numerical models. Based on the repair conditions provided by classification societies, the numerical results showed that 25 % locally corroded area of a plate (800 mm × 800 mm × 15 mm) with 3. 75 mm remaining thickness may reduce the ultimate strength by up to 20 % compared to a uniformly corroded plate. The weld-induced grooving corrosion of a width of 59 mm and a remaining thickness of 3. 75 mm would cause up to 26 % strength capacity reduction for a stiffened plate (4750 mm × 950 mm × 15 mm). Moreover, it was shown that the corrosion depth had a greater influence on structural performance compared to corrosion area for the same volume/material loss. By combining mechano-electrochemical protocols with the stress and strain results obtained from the modelling, it enables predictions of the ‘hot spot’ locations of mechanically-induced corrosion acceleration. Results showed that the anodic current density inside grooving corrosion damage (24 mm in width and 3. 75 mm in depth) was 7 times greater vis-a-vis the unstressed condition for the stiffened plate at its ultimate strength state. The results, which are closely related to the industrial corrosion inspection and repair requirement, will not only benefit the shipping industry, but are also applicable to a whole range of marine structures (offshore platforms and steel bridges) ...|$|E
