After Suharto's removal from power, many people, including those involved, told other versions of the events in various books and films.

In retrospective reviews, critics considered that the novel had aged badly, and that Terhune displayed little actual writing skill, but noted that the novel was able to hold long-lasting appeal as it triggered the reader's desire to have such an ideal dog. Terhune himself considered the novel [...] "hack writing" [...] and did not <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> was so popular.

He also once said that his goal for the series was to tell an [...] "unconventional and contradictory" [...] story.

500|$|When Dragon Ball began, it was {{loosely based}} on the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West, with Goku being Sun Wukong and Bulma as Xuanzang. Toriyama {{continued}} to use his characteristic comedic style in the beginning, but {{over the course of}} time this slowly changed, with him turning the series into a [...] "nearly-pure fighting manga" [...] later on. He did not plan out in advance what would happen in the series, instead choosing to draw as he went. This, coupled with him simply forgetting things he had already drawn, caused him to find himself in situations that he had to write himself out of.

[...] Explaining its basic formula of [...] "lots of martial arts, lots of training sequences, [...] a few jokes" [...] became the model for other shōnen series, such as Naruto. Thompson cited the artwork as influential, pointing out that popular shōnen manga of the late 1980s and early 1990s had [...] "manly" [...] heroes, such as City Hunter and Fist of the North Star, whereas Dragon Ball had the cartoonish and small Goku, thus starting a trend that he says still continues.

2500|$|The English {{were among}} the first who saw the {{tendency}} of Champagne to sparkle as a desirable trait, and tried to <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> did bubble. In 1662, the English scientist Christopher Merret presented a paper detailing how the presence of sugar in a wine led to it eventually sparkling, and that nearly any wine could be made to sparkle by adding sugar to a wine before bottling it. This {{is one of the first}} known accounts of understanding the process of sparkling wine and suggests that British merchants were producing [...] "sparkling Champagne" [...] even before the French Champenois were deliberately making it. Concurrently, advances in glass manufacture in Britain, by George Ravenscroft and others, allowed more robust wine bottle to be made which could contain the effervescence without exploding. The popularity of sparkling Champagne steadily grew. In 1663, the British poet Samuel Butler penned the first written English reference to [...] "brisk" [...] (i.e. frothy) Champagne in his poem Hudibras. The 1698 George Farquhar play Love and a Bottle featured one of the characters marveling at the steady stream of bubbles in a glass of a Champagne. As the popularity of sparkling Champagne grew in London, other European courts began to discover the bubbly curiosity-including the French who had previously despised the bubbles as a wine fault.|$|E
2500|$|The British {{were the}} first to see the {{tendency}} of wines from Champagne to sparkle as a desirable trait and tried to <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> produced bubbles. Wine was often transported to England in wooden wine barrels where merchant houses would then bottle the wine for sale. During the 17th century, English glass production used coal-fueled ovens and produced stronger, more durable glass bottles than the wood-fired French glass. The English also rediscovered the use of cork stoppers, once used by the Romans but forgotten for centuries {{after the fall of the}} Western Roman Empire. During the cold winters of the Champagne region, temperatures would drop so low that the fermentation process was prematurely halted—leaving some residual sugar and dormant yeast. When the wine was shipped to and bottled in England, the fermentation process would restart when the weather warmed and the cork-stoppered wine would begin to build pressure from carbon dioxide gas. When the wine was opened, it would be bubbly. In 1662, the English scientist Christopher Merret presented a paper detailing how the presence of sugar in a wine led to it eventually sparkling and that by adding sugar to a wine before bottling it, nearly any wine could be made to sparkle.
