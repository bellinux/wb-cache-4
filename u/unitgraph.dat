40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} to develop a synthetic <b>unitgraph</b> procedure which would have fairly general applicability to small catchments in eastern New South Wales. A survey of the available literature was made and from this {{it appeared that the}} most logical procedures proposed have been those based on the routing of a catchment time-area diagram through the catchment storage. This type of procedure was adopted. The relevant <b>unitgraph</b> parameters were determined by trial and error from the catchment time-area diagram and average <b>unitgraph.</b> An objective method of deriving the <b>unitgraph</b> parameters was also developed. It was shown that the <b>unitgraph</b> parameters defined by other workers were unsatisfactory for the catchments used in this study. The adopted <b>unitgraph</b> parameters were correlated, by trial and error, with combinations of catchment characteristics and a relationship between the catchment characteristics and <b>unitgraph</b> parameters was proposed. Relationships proposed by other workers were examined and generally found to be inapplicable to the catchments studied. A subsidiary investigation involved the derivation of an average <b>unitgraph</b> for each of nine catchments* A major subsidiary investigation was carried out to derive stage-discharge relations by hydraulic model methods for the gauging station controls on three small catchments...|$|E

Inflow hydrographs were computed and routed through the storage system of the three lakes, taking into account the discharge characteristics of Budgewoi channel, characteristics of constrictions at Toukley bridge and inflow characteristics of The Entrance channel. Resulting lake levels for floods of various recurrenrt frequencies can be used {{to estimate}} the design basement level for power stations for this area...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effect of}} basin size on runoff {{characteristics}} is investigated. The maximum observed floodflow, the maximum annual constant loss, the lag {{time and the}} <b>unitgraph</b> peak for a certain storm duration of basins in the western and northwestern regions of Greece are increasing power functions of the basin size. These functions explain significantly the variation in the runoff characteristics. For both regions single relationships are derived for the latter two characteristics, whereas for the two former ones they vary regionally in accordance to the climatic conditions. Thus, care is needed in transferring such relationships outside the location of their derivation; besides, the transferability {{of the values of}} their parameters is doubtful. The derivation of the relationships in th...|$|E

Sherman, Consulting Engineer of Chicago, IL (and author of the classic paper on the <b>unitgraph)</b> and Robert E. Horton, Consulting Hydraulic Engineer of Voorheesville, NY, concerning rapid rises of groundwater levels in near-stream wells {{and their relationship to}} the storm hydrograph. They provide an interesting insight into the views of both Sherman and Horton on controls on stream flow generation, and the relationship between Horton and other hydrologists. Horton's analysis of subsurface flow processes and saturated areas anticipates later analyses of topographic controls on hydrological responses...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the parking demand models for private cars and goods vehicles developed {{as part of}} a parking demand study that was completed in Hong Kong in 1995. In the model, it is assumed that there is a linear and additive demand function relating land-use variables in a zone (such as jobs, schools, or households) with parking demand. Further, the parking activity associated with each land-use variable is assumed to have a unique parking accumulation profile. Surveys were conducted to determine these profiles. A <b>unitgraph,</b> which is defined as the parking accumulation profile per parking activity, was constructed for each landuse variable. Given the land-use variables, the parking demand function, and the unitgraphs, the total parking accumulation profile in each zone is determined. Â©ASCE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
