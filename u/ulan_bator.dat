25|$|The {{opposition}} Mongolian People's Party nominated parliament member Badmaanyambuugiin Bat-Erdene. Bat-Erdene is {{a former}} wrestling champion {{and was the first}} wrestler to be announced as a presidential candidate in Mongolia. Bat-Erdene had a more conservative backing within <b>Ulan</b> <b>Bator.</b> Mongolian People's Party was the former communist party in power prior to the democratic revolution in 1990.|$|E
25|$|Both Elbegdorj and Bat-Erdene saw {{backing from}} the urban {{population}} in <b>Ulan</b> <b>Bator,</b> Bat-Erdene having more of a conservative following and the incumbent president supported by the middle class. Elbegdorj won the election with 50.9% of the popular votes, a nearly 9% margin over Bat-Erdene. Udval received 6.6% of the popular vote. Elbegdorj's re-election keeps the Democratic Party in power both in the presidency and the State Great Khural.|$|E
25|$|Bayar was {{admitted}} {{to a hospital in}} <b>Ulan</b> <b>Bator</b> in October 2009. Because of his declining health, Bayar announced his resignation in a letter to Mongolia's parliament one week later on 26 October 2009. A meeting held two days later confirmed that the Mongolian parliament had accepted his resignation. Bayar apologised to those who had voted for him. Norov Altankhuyag, the First Vice Prime Minister, temporarily moved up as Bayar's replacement. Bayar then was replaced by Sükhbaataryn Batbold on 29 October 2009.|$|E
25|$|When the Qing dynasty {{collapsed}} with {{establishment of}} the new Republic of China (ROC) in 1911, majority of the Inner Mongolian principalities allied themselves with the Outer Mongols rather than with the Mongolian Bogd Khaganate. China's early republican leaders used slogans like Five Races Under One Union, democracy, and meritocracy {{to try to persuade}} all of the Mongols to join the new republic. However, they were never really able to hide their condescension towards the frontier peoples. In the summer of 1911, Mongolia's princes had already decided to declare independence and turn towards Russia for support. They gathered with Russian representatives in <b>Ulan</b> <b>Bator</b> and persuaded Russia to defend Mongol autonomy within China. The Russians understood this autonomy to apply only in Outer Mongolia, but the princes interpreted it as sanctifying a Greater Mongolia of Outer Mongolia, Inner Mongolia, Eastern Mongolia, and Tannu Uriankhai (Tuva).|$|E
25|$|In 1644, Ivan Pokhabov {{went up the}} Angara to Baikal, {{becoming}} {{perhaps the}} first Russian to use this route, which is difficult because of the rapids. He crossed the lake and explored the lower Selenge River. About 1647, he repeated the trip, obtained guides, and visited a 'Tsetsen Khan' near <b>Ulan</b> <b>Bator.</b> In 1648, Ivan Galkin built an ostrog on the Barguzin River which became a center for eastward expansion. In 1652, Vasily Kolesnikov reported from Barguzin that one could reach the Amur country by following the Selenga, Uda, and Khilok Rivers to the future sites of Chita and Nerchinsk. In 1653, Pyotr Beketov took Kolesnikov's route to Lake Irgen west of Chita, and that winter his man Urasov founded Nerchinsk. Next spring, he tried to occupy Nerchensk, but was forced by his men to join Stephanov on the Amur. Nerchinsk was destroyed by the local Tungus, but restored in 1658.|$|E
2500|$|The Garuda, {{known as}} Khangarid, is {{the symbol of}} the capital city of Mongolia, <b>Ulan</b> <b>Bator.</b> [...] According to popular Mongolian belief, Khangarid is the {{mountain}} spirit of the Bogd Khan Uul range who became a follower of Buddhist faith. Today he is considered the guardian of that mountain range and a symbol of courage and honesty.|$|E
2500|$|The Mongol Rally is an Intercontinental car rally {{that begins}} in Europe and {{originally}} ended in <b>Ulan</b> <b>Bator,</b> Mongolia. To avoid punitive costs and taxes associated with vehicle imports and disposal, the rally now passes through Mongolia and ends in Ulan Ude, Russia. The principal launch is from Goodwood Circuit in the United Kingdom, with subsidiary starting {{points in the}} Czech Republic. It is described as the [...] "Greatest Adventure in the World" [...] and sees on average a 70% completion rate. There are three fundamental : ...|$|E
2500|$|Turkic Kaganate - the {{so-called}} [...] "Bugut Stele" [...] {{of the late}} 6th century from Arkhangai Province in western Mongolia with a Sogdian and (most likely) Sanskrit inscription was installed on a stone tortoise. It {{is now in the}} provincial capital, Tsetserleg. According to the Turkish researcher Cengiz Alyilmaz, it was the design of this stele that influenced the builders of the important 8th-century stelae with Old Turkic inscriptions, many of which also stood on tortoises. Among them, the most accessible one is probably Bayanchur Khan's (Eletmish Bilge Kağan)'s Terhin-Gol stele (753 AD), now in the Mongolian Academy of Sciences in <b>Ulan</b> <b>Bator.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Some of the world's longest train {{journeys}} by distance {{travel through}} China. [...] Beijing-Moscow trains via Harbin (No. 19-20, 8984km, 144 hours) and <b>Ulan</b> <b>Bator</b> (No. 3-4, 7826km, 131 hours) are respectively {{the second and}} third longest regularly scheduled passenger trains in the world. Only the Moscow-Vladivostok train (9259km, 178 hours) is longer. [...] Within China, the longest passenger train services are the T264-T265 Guangzhou-Lhasa (4980km, 54 1/2 hours), T206/3-T204/5 Shanghai-Yining (4742km, 55 2/3 hours), Z136/7-Z138/5 Guangzhou-Ürümqi (4684km, 49 1/2 hours) and K1121 Harbin-Haikou (4458km, 65 3/4 hours). In addition, the longest train journey in China by time is K2288/2285 from Changchun to Kunming, with a duration of 68 hours.|$|E
2500|$|The new Mongolian {{state was}} {{a fusion of}} very {{different}} elements: Western political institutions, Mongolian theocracy, and Qing imperial administrative and political traditions. December 29 was declared to be independence day and a national holiday. Urga (modern <b>Ulan</b> <b>Bator),</b> until then known to the Mongolians as the [...] "Great Monastery" [...] (Ikh khüree), was renamed [...] "Capital Monastery" [...] (Niislel khüree) to reflect its new role as the seat of government. A state name, [...] "Great Mongolian State" [...] (Ikh Mongol uls), and a state flag were adopted. A parliament (ulsyn khural) was created, comprising upper and lower houses. [...] A new Mongolian government was formed with five ministries: internal affairs, foreign affairs, finance, justice, and the army. Consequently, a national army was created.|$|E
2500|$|In 1920, {{when he was}} Assistant Chinese Secretary in the American Legation in Peking, Price was {{assigned}} to escort an American trading company’s caravan of Model-T Fords from the Chinese border, across the Gobi desert to Urga, Mongolia (now <b>Ulan</b> <b>Bator).</b> While {{he was responsible for}} negotiating passage for the American businessmen though the territory of various Chinese warlords, Price was also charged with a secret mission of contacting the United States consul in Irkutsk, Russia. Due to the chaos in Siberia caused by the Bolshevik revolution and the subsequent civil war in Russia, the American consul had not been heard from in many months. [...] Price was successful in both tasks, and returned to China in the company of Roy Chapman Andrews, the well known archeologist and adventurer who is often cited as the inspiration for Indiana Jones. [...] Andrews recounted the journey in this book Across Mongolian Plain. Here is how Andrews recalled one of their travel adventures: ...|$|E
2500|$|After the Mongolian Revolution in 1990 {{brought about}} a [...] "truly independent" [...] Mongolia apart from Soviet influence, both China and Russia {{expressed}} concerns that the pan-Mongol nationalism that was flourishing in Mongolia could penetrate into their borderlands. A surge in pan-Mongol sentiment resulted {{in a series of}} [...] "Unite the Three Mongolias" [...] conferences in <b>Ulan</b> <b>Bator,</b> as well as government-funded organizations for [...] "international Mongol cultural development". In 1992, Mongolia's foreign ministry published an extensive list of territory it claimed to have [...] "lost" [...] to various areas in China and Russia in border demarcations in 1915, 1932, 1940, 1957, 1962, and 1975. At the same time, three main criticisms of pan-Mongolism emerged in Mongolia. The first emphasized Mongolian nationalism, which argued that Mongolia needed to integrate its existing non-Mongol minorities, such as its Kazakhs, rather than to expand outside of its borders. The second expressed a belief in the superiority of the Khalkha Mongols as the most racially pure Mongols ("Khalkha-centrism"), looking down on the Buryat and Inner Mongols as Russian and Chinese [...] "half-breeds", respectively. The third criticism noted that the political power of those within the current borders of Mongolia would be diluted in a Greater Mongolia. Khalkha centric nationalists discriminate against Oirat and Buryats from Russia and Inner Mongols from China, viewing them as agents of Russia and China respectively.|$|E
2500|$|Galdan {{allied with}} the Zasagtu Khan against the Tushetu Khan, who in turn {{attacked}} the Dzashgtu Khan (who drowned while trying to escape) and then invaded Dzungar territory where he killed one of Galdan's brothers. Galdan responded (1688) by annihilating the Tushetu Khan's army near the Tarim River and plundering the tombs at Karakoram. The Tushetu Khan and the other Khalkha leaders fled to Hohhot at {{the northeast corner of}} the Ordos Loop and beseeched Qing for help. By 1690, Galdan had controlled the whole Khalkha country as far as the edge of Manchuria, before turning his attention east towards Beijing. This direct threat to Qing led the Kangxi Emperor (Enh-Amgalan khaan-in Mongolian) to block Galdan who withdrew to the northwest in late 1690. In May 1691 the Emperor held a Kurultai at Dolon Nor (Dolonnuur) where the Khalkha chiefs declared themselves vassals of the Qing Emperors. In 1695 Galdan moved east again. The Emperor sent a massive army and defeated him near <b>Ulan</b> <b>Bator</b> (at Jao Modo or Zuunmod on June 12, 1696). Galdan fled with a few followers and later died. [...] Outer Mongolia was thus incorporated into the Qing Empire, and the Khalkha leaders returned to Outer Mongolia as Qing vassals. A Qing garrison was installed at Ulaanbaatar. [...] The Qing forces occupied Hami but did not advance into Dzungaria. Oirats later expanded into Tibet and Kazakhstan and they tried to control all Mongols.|$|E
2500|$|Korean {{nationalist}} historiography {{is connected}} with [...] "popular archaeology" [...] in South Korea, where television archaeologists competing for ratings make ever more-expansive claims {{to the limits of}} ancient Korea. For example, in 1993 the Korea Daily sponsored a trip of archaeologist Son Bo-gi of Yonsei University to <b>Ulan</b> <b>Bator,</b> Mongolia where Son claimed that he discovered a new Goguryeo stone fortress which proved that Goguryeo extended beyond the Greater Khingan range. Korean Bronze Age art has been connected by popular archaeologists, for example, to that of the Scythians, supposedly proving the [...] "arrival of a superior northern race" [...] into the Korean peninsula. Korean journalists and researchers also regularly travel along Silk Road sites in Central Asia searching for Korea's [...] "Altaic roots". Choe Nam-seon, writing in the territorial tradition of Shin Chae-ho, argued that Korea {{was the center of the}} Purham culture which extended deep into Central Asia. According to Choe, the world was divided into Indo-European, Chinese, and [...] "Părk" [...] cultures (Purham munhwa kwŏn), the last of whom was a Korean Shinto-like religion that spread from the Black Sea through the Caspian Sea, Tian Shan, the Altai Mountains, down through Korea, Japan, and Okinawa. Choe alleged that Dangun was universally worshiped within this super-culture. However, according to Chizuko Allen, Choe did not examine the local cultures of any countries besides Korea, China, and Japan, and based this theory on phonetic similarities of geographical features. Choe's Purham culture theory has since been adopted by the independence activist and [...] "Korean Studies movement" [...] leader An Chae-hong.|$|E
2500|$|After {{crossing}} the desert, Wei Qing's army unexpectedly encountered Chanyu Yizhixie's main forces, who {{was waiting in}} anticipation of ambushing the Han army. [...] Despite being significantly outnumbered as well as fatigued after the long journey, Wei Qing was able to counter Xiongnu's cavalry charge with archery defense created by heavy-armored chariots arranged in ring formations, which was reinforced with cavalry counteroffensives. (This defense would be evaluated {{as one of the}} most effective against cavalry by many later Chinese tacticians, including Yue Fei.) [...] The Han forces successfully enforced a stalemate that lasted until dusk, when a sandstorm descended upon the battlefield. [...] Seizing the moment of poor visibility provided by the dust, Wei Qing broke the stalemate and launched bilateral flanking attacks with his cavalries. [...] Already exhausted after a day of unsuccessful attacks against Han positions, the sudden sight of incoming Han soldiers in the darkness further broke the Xiongnu's morale, routing them. [...] This decisive pincer attack shattered the Chanyu's line, nearly capturing him and completely overrunning his forces, killing over 10,000 Xiongnu soldiers in the process. [...] The Han army pursued all the way to the modern <b>Ulan</b> <b>Bator</b> region, destroying the Xiongnu stronghold Zhao Xin Castle (趙信城) before returning in triumph with a total of about 19,000 enemy kills. [...] Chanyu Yizhixie was forced to escape with very few men, lost communication with his tribe for days, and did not return until his clan presumed his death and installed a new Chanyu. [...] This was a narrow but critically significant victory for the Han empire. [...] Xiongnu was greatly weakened to the point that they would huddle up into the barren northern Gobi desert (leading to decline of their population), and unable to raid south for the next decade. [...] The next major Xiongnu invasion did not occur until after the Han dynasty collapsed, some 400 years later during the Jin Dynasty.|$|E
