5|$|On June 8, 2008 the {{congregation}} dedicated its new building at 1175 East 29th Avenue. At approximately , the facility included a sanctuary, commercial kitchen, banquet facilities, and classrooms, and housed the synagogue, the Lane County Jewish Federation, {{and the local}} Jewish Family Service. The project ended <b>up</b> <b>costing</b> $6 million, of which $4 million had been raised.|$|E
5|$|After leaving Apogee, Jackson {{entered into}} {{a joint venture with}} Clair Brothers to design a digital {{loudspeaker}} controller for control of complex concert sound systems. Jackson estimated that the project would cost $800,000 in U.S. dollars, but it ended <b>up</b> <b>costing</b> Clair Brothers more than $2M. From the same garage in which he started Apogee, Jackson developed the proprietary Clair iO: a two-input, six-output digital audio matrix with opto-isolated output circuits. An essential element of the system was its ability to be controlled by wireless tablet computer by an audio engineer walking around to various seating sections in a concert venue, to tailor the system's response more precisely.|$|E
5|$|Joe Bangs {{finds himself}} unable {{to have the}} case dropped, but Bletcher still feels that Black's pursuit of it may end <b>up</b> <b>costing</b> her her job. However, Black knows she is {{doing the right thing}} and is {{determined}} to continue. Her fears for Sara are confirmed when it is discovered she and the elder Bangs have gone missing. Frank, an offender profiler, deduces that Bangs' controlling personality would cause him to take his daughter somewhere he knows, and realizes that they will be in the family's holiday cabin in the woods. A police manhunt begins, and Bangs is arrested without Sara coming to harm.|$|E
40|$|Zero Inventory (ZI) {{is a new}} and {{powerful}} concept to improve production efficiency. Underpinning ZI is set up reduction and this paper examines what eventuates when set <b>up</b> <b>costs</b> are cut. The folklore is that set up reduction lowers inventory and costs. We obtain results contrary to that. Reducing set <b>up</b> <b>costs</b> need not reduce inventory, for example. Likewise lowering set <b>up</b> <b>costs</b> need not necessarily lower total production and inventory costs. Furthermore, most investments produce marginally decreasing returns. Set <b>up</b> <b>cost</b> reduction prompts the opposite; it produces marginally increasing (not decreasing) returns. A parametric algorithm that calculates the benefit of set <b>up</b> <b>cost</b> reduction is provided. Most presentations of ZI have been descriptive with very few mathematical models of it yet untaken. By modeling certain ZI concepts mathematically, we scrutinize their validity and sometimes invalidity. inventory/production: zero inventory, facilities/equipment: planning, inventory/production: parametric analysis...|$|R

5|$|The tunnel was budgeted to cost NOK496 million, {{but ended}} <b>up</b> <b>costing</b> NOK487 million. It opened {{along with the}} Stord Bridge on 27 December 2000. Six hours before the opening, {{the bottom of the}} tunnel was used for a wedding. The toll company held a course for people with fear of tunnels to master their fears, with 60 people participating. The {{official}} opening took place on 30 April 2001. When it opened, it was the longest and second-deepest subsea tunnel in Europe and Norway, after the Hitra Tunnel.|$|E
5|$|According to the Miami Herald the {{financing}} {{structure of the}} plan is notable {{for the amount of}} financial risk taken by the builders in return for the long term concession on the tunnel. Opposition to the project states that it is a waste of taxpayer money, and may become Miami's Big Dig, the nickname of a tunnel megaproject in Boston, which was a $4 billion project that ended <b>up</b> <b>costing</b> $22 billion in cost overruns. Many believe that the Port of Miami Tunnel Project will be likely to have similar cost overruns, even though the Secretary of the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) promised that the project would finish on time and without overruns. They also state that truck traffic is not a problem in Downtown, and that since 1991 car and truck traffic had reduced significantly.|$|E
5|$|For {{the third}} {{successive}} tournament, Wales had {{missed out on}} qualification by a slender margin, having missed the 1982 World Cup on goal difference, and the 1984 European Championship by a single point. Despite this setback, which {{was followed by a}} 3–0 home defeat to Hungary in October, the team went {{through the rest of the}} season with only one other defeat, against Canada in May 1986. There was also the sense of history repeating itself in that, just as in 1977, it was a controversial penalty decision that ended <b>up</b> <b>costing</b> them dearly. Despite this however, there was also a feeling that, given the group of players available to them, they would qualify for the next tournament. As it was, Wales failed to qualify for a major tournament until the 2016 European Championships.|$|E

5|$|No {{significant}} portion of Leitch's original stadium remains today following a series of bold redevelopments during the 1930s. The idea {{was to create a}} ground for London that could capture the grandeur of Villa Park, home of Birmingham club Aston Villa. The Highbury project was ambitious in its scale and reach, the first stand completed being the West Stand, designed by Claude Waterlow Ferrier and William Binnie in the Art Deco style which opened in 1932. On 5 November the same year the local Tube station was renamed from Gillespie Road to Arsenal. Leitch's main stand was demolished {{to make way for a}} new East Stand, matching the West, in 1936. The West Stand cost £45,000 while the East Stand went far over budget and ended <b>up</b> <b>costing</b> £130,000, mainly thanks to the expense of the facade. The North Bank terrace was given a roof and the southern terrace had a clock fitted to its front, giving it the name the Clock End.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{inspired}} by the financial success of The Astounding She-Monster in which Clarke had starred. The film's crew was made up of University of Southern California film students, and the film's cast were either unknowns or Clarke's family and friends. The film was shot during 12 consecutive weekends and was shot by three different cinematographers. Originally budgeted at $10,000, it ended <b>up</b> <b>costing</b> $50,000. The Hideous Sun Demon premiered on August 29, 1958 as part of a double bill with Roger Corman's Attack of the Crab Monsters. The film received mostly negative reviews upon its release, but has since become a cult film and has been referenced and parodied many times. An unauthorized sequel, the 1965 short film Wrath of the Sun Demon, was produced by Donald F. Glut. Two redubbed versions of the original film have been released: the comedic Hideous Sun Demon: Special Edition and What's Up, Hideous Sun Demon (also known as Revenge of the Sun Demon), the latter of which was produced with Clarke's permission.|$|E
5|$|A {{short run}} of Gran Trak systems was {{produced}} in March 1974 and revealed other design problems, such as the steering controls; in their prototype system, Eigen used real a real car steering wheel and pedals, but the production run used different parts. Alcorn returned to Cyan that month and redesigned the game to fix the flaws and use more standard parts; the copying protection scheme was changed to use a custom-designed integrated circuit that was named {{the same as a}} standard Texas Instruments integrated circuit. Alcorn later stated in an interview that neither Warman nor Emmons understood the challenges in converting a prototype design to a product that could be manufactured. The game entered production soon after, and Atari announced it was shipping a full production run in May 1974. Although the design flaws were fixed, the communication problems during development led to one final problem with the game: Atari was unclear on the actual cost of producing the game. As a result, a single Gran Trak game ended <b>up</b> <b>costing</b> US$1,095 to manufacture, while Atari was selling them to distributors for only $995, losing $100 per sale. Atari soon corrected the problem, but ended the fiscal year with a large loss {{due in part to the}} financial failure of the game.|$|E

25|$|The Integrated National Crime Information System (INCIS) was a {{computer}} software package developed by IBM {{in the early}} 1990s to provide improved information, investigation and analysis capabilities to the Police. Deputy Police Commissioner, Barry Matthews, was responsible for its implementation and acknowledged that police requested 'hundreds and hundreds of changes' to the system as the programme was being developed. It never worked as required and ended <b>up</b> <b>costing</b> $130 million before it was finally abandoned in 2000.|$|E
25|$|The {{film was}} {{based in part on}} an unproduced {{screenplay}} called The Man Who Came to Play by Louis Garfinkle and Quinn K. Redeker, about Las Vegas and Russian roulette. Producer Michael Deeley, who bought the script, hired writer/director Michael Cimino who, with Deric Washburn, rewrote the script, taking the Russian roulette element and placing it in the Vietnam War. The film went over-budget and over-schedule, and ended <b>up</b> <b>costing</b> $15 million. The scenes depicting Russian roulette were highly controversial after the film's release.|$|E
25|$|After {{two months}} of absence, Mendes {{returned}} as Fandango's new dance partner on the Survivor Series pre-show on November 23. Fandango defeated Justin Gabriel with a Salsa dancer gimmick and new theme music. On the April 13, 2015 episode of Raw, Fandango dissolved his relationship with Mendes. Later that night, Mendes competed in a Divas battle royal to determine the #1 contender for the WWE Divas Championship. Mendes eliminated Natalya and Summer Rae before being eliminated by Emma. Following {{the end of her}} association with Fandango, Mendes ended <b>up</b> <b>costing</b> him a match to Adam Rose, whom she subsequently went on to manage.|$|E

The salvage operation ended <b>up</b> <b>costing</b> almost $20,000 with subsequent repairs at Moran's costing additional $10,000 which amounted to {{almost half of the}} vessel's value. Due to the imbalance in financing of the salvage operation caused by Elmer Caine's using his tug and men, {{by the end of the}} salvage, he ended up owning 50% share of the vessel. However, by 1903 Elmer Caine sold his share to Charles Nelson Co. which became the Minnie A. Caine sole owner.|$|E
25|$|The Buckeyes {{had high}} {{expectations}} again entering the 1996 contest. They boasted an unblemished 10–0 record and were ranked #2 {{in the nation}} {{as they entered the}} finale with 7–3 Michigan. When Ohio State jumped to a 9–0 halftime lead, the OSU crowd sensed a special finish and perhaps a rise to #1. The Wolverines' defense shut the Buckeyes out in the second half while Brian Griese replaced the struggling Scott Dreisbach and led Michigan to 13 unanswered points and another victory over their rivals, 13–9. The game {{would turn out to be}} the Buckeyes' only loss of the season and ended <b>up</b> <b>costing</b> them a chance of the national championship.|$|E
25|$|After a 7–6–1 {{record in}} 1962, Modell fired Paul Brown on January 9, 1963, and {{replaced}} him {{one week later}} with longtime assistant Blanton Collier. Many of the Browns' younger players, such as Jim Brown and quarterback Frank Ryan, had chafed under Brown's autocratic coaching style; in contrast, Collier ran the club with a much looser grip. He installed a much more open offense and allowed Ryan to call his own plays. In Collier's first season, the Browns won their first six games, but a damaging midseason slump ended <b>up</b> <b>costing</b> them the Eastern Division title as they finished one game back with a 10–4 mark. On an individual level, Jim Brown won Most Valuable Player accolades with a record 1,863 yards rushing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Electricity {{companies}} typically possess numerous {{units and}} they need to commit units because electricity cannot be stored in a large-scale system and demand is a random variable process fluctuating with the time of the day and the day of the week. A problem that must be frequently resolved by a electricity utility is to economically determine a schedule of what units will be used to meet the forecasted demand, and satisfy operating constraints such as start <b>up</b> <b>cost,</b> over a short time horizon. This problem is commonly referred to as the unit commitment (UC) problem. Lagrangian algorithm is one of the technique based on equal IC of fuel input for the units in operation. It is helpful for the optimium load sharing among units, with satisfying constraints under different environment. Simulation algorithm is prepared in this paper, keeping start <b>up</b> <b>cost</b> constraint optimization and simulation is done with Matlab for standard set of Units. Optimized IC and load sharing values are extracted sharing different start <b>up</b> <b>cost.</b> Different IC values are extracted for different load demands...|$|R
