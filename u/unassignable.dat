60|$|I {{desire to}} confine my remarks to the {{principle}} involved in all these suggestions, without taking into account practical difficulties, serious as these must at once be seen to be. I shall suppose that by one or other of these contrivances wages could be kept above the point to which they would be brought by competition. This is as much as to say, above the highest rate which can be afforded by the existing capital consistently with employing all the laborers. For {{it is a mistake}} to suppose that competition merely keeps down wages. It is equally the means by which they are kept up. When there are any laborers unemployed, these, unless maintained by charity, become competitors for hire, and wages fall; but when all who were out of work have found employment, wages will not, under the freest system of competition, fall lower. There are strange notions afloat concerning the nature of competition. Some people seem to imagine that its effect is something indefinite; that the competition of sellers may lower prices, and the competition of laborers may lower wages, down to zero, or some <b>unassignable</b> minimum. Nothing can be more unfounded. Goods can only be lowered in price by competition to the point which calls forth buyers sufficient to take them off; and wages can only be lowered by competition until room is made to admit all the laborers to a share in the distribution of the wages-fund. If they fell below this point, a portion of capital would remain unemployed for want of laborers; a counter-competition would commence on the side of capitalists, and wages would rise.|$|E

But, that this forma or cause is one thing, and that it is the same in all hot objects, he has no more doubt of, than another person has that there is always some cause or other. In the present state of knowledge it could not be necessary, even if we had not already treated so fully of the question, to point out how widely this supposition is at variance with the truth. It is particularly unfortunate for Bacon that, falling into this error, he should have fixed almost exclusively upon a class of inquiries in which it was especially fatal; namely, inquiries into the causes of the sensible qualities of objects. For his assumption, groundless in every case, is false in a peculiar degree with respect to those sensible qualities. In regard to scarcely any of them has it been found possible to trace any unity of cause, any set of conditions invariably accompanying the quality. The conjunctions of such qualities with one another constitute the variety of Kinds, in which, as already remarked, it has not been found possible to trace any law. Bacon was seeking for what did not exist. The phenomenon of which he sought for the one cause has oftenest no cause at all, and when it has, depends (as far as hitherto ascertained) on an <b>unassignable</b> variety of distinct causes.|$|E

As active subject people cannot be reduced to a sum of distinct individuals, they remain indeterminate. People exercise indeed their sovereignty as subject of public opinion, and this subject is essentially “unassignable” and “indefinite”.

All rearrangement-mediating duplications include either the origin of light strand replication and the nearby tRNA genes or the regions flanking the origin of heavy strand replication. The latter regions comprise nad 6, trnE, cob, trnT, an intergenic spacer between trnT and trnP and, in some genomes, trnP, the control region, trnF, rrnS, trnV, rrnL, trnL 1, and nad 1.

These transitions involve mostly high-lying rotational levels within the (0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 2, 0), (1, 0, 0), and (0, 0, 1) vibrational states. Transitions within the (0, 3, 0), (0, 4, 0), (1, 1, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 1), (1, 1, 1), (1, 2, 0), and (1, 0, 1) states are also assigned.

Much of this complexity is gratuitous, and {{can be made to}} disappear when a suitable double resonance scheme is employed. Sometimes it is necessary to devise devious schemes for circumventing obstacles (selection rules, Franck-Condon factors, potential energy barriers) to important types of molecular structural information (e. g. dissociation energies) or classes of molecular energy levels (e. g. triplets, localized vibrational excitations suited for bond specific photochemistry). The traditional spectroscopic concepts and well-trodden path from spectrum to potential energy surface via molecular constants is ill suited for characterizing the large amplitude displacements of atoms from their equilibrium positions which occur in simple unimolecular dynamical processes. Cross-correlation of double resonance spectra may provide a direct view of specifiable intramolecular processes. Four spectroscopic examples will be discussed : (i) Stimulated Emission Pumping (SEP) spectroscopy of formaldehyde, an example of a well-behaved molecule in the small amplitude limit, for which a complete set of harmonic vibrational frequencies (ω 1) and anharmonicities (xij) is determined; (ii) Perturbation Facilitated Optical-Optical Double Resonance (PFOODR) spectroscopy of Li 2, illustrating access to triplet states and the phenomenon of "accidental predissociation"; (iii) determination of an upper bound to the HCC-H dissociation energy of acetylene by Zeeman Anti-Crossing (ZAC) spectroscopy, a cooperative predissociation scheme similar to the accidental predissociation in Li 2 whereby, despite potential energy barriers, one can ensure that the onset of dissociation will be detected not far above the thermochemical limit; (iv) detection and characterization of a vinylidene vibrational level through the effect of acetylen-vinylidene isomerization on the cross-correlation of acetylene SEP spectra, illustrating a new, direct way of sampling intramolecular dynamics at such high internal energies that vibrational spectra are intrinsically <b>unassignable...</b>|$|E

The chillers used, and air-conditioning systems served, vary in design from plant to plant. The review of operating experience indicated that chillers experience aging degradation and failures. The primary aging factors of concern for chillers include vibration, excessive temperatures and pressures, thermal cycling, chemical attack, and poor quality cooling water. The evaluation of Licensee Event Reports (LERs) indicated that about 38 % of the failures were primarily related to aging, 55 % were partially aging related, and 7 % of the failures were <b>unassignable.</b> About 25 % of the failures were primarily caused by human, design, procedure, and other errors. The large number of errors is probably {{directly related to the}} complexity of chillers and their interfacing systems. Nearly all of the LERs were the result of entering plant Technical Specification Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) that initiated remedial actions like plant shutdown procedures. The trend for chiller-related LERs has stabilized at about 0. 13 LERs per plant year since 1988. Carefully following the vendor procedures and monitoring the equipment can help to minimize and/or eliminate most of the premature failures. Recording equipment performance can be useful for trending analysis. Periodic operation for a few hours on a weekly or monthly basis is useful to remove moisture and non-condensable gases that gradually build up inside the chiller. Chiller pressurization kits are available that will help minimize the amount of moisture and air ingress to low-pressure chillers during standby periods. The assessment of service life condition monitoring of chillers indicated there are many simple to sophisticated methods available that can help in chiller surveillance and monitoring...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{meanings}} of Christian salvation {{within the context of}} the AIDS pandemic in South Africa. The pandemic poses enormous social, economic, developmental, as well as theological, problems for the fledgling democracy of South Africa. The pandemic has stricken the whole continent of Africa particularly forcefully, but in South Africa, where there had been expectations of a new order since the peaceful overthrow of the apartheid government in 1994, the expectations of "salvation" for the nation have been cruelly dashed by the force of the pandemic. With the aid of a lemma, I show that salvation is neither equivalent to and coextensive with political liberation, nor reducible to a <b>unassignable</b> spiritual state of being in relationship with Christ. Rather, as in Old Testament writings, salvation should be understood as having direct bearing on the immediate context of the person or nation in question [...] -which understanding is frequently overlooked. In the context of AIDS, then, an understanding of salvation should have a bearing on social death due to the stigma of the condition; on the healing of the illness itself; on the reconciliation of people whose lives are immediately affected by the pandemic; on addressing those social factors which allow the spread of HIV, and on the tardiness in the provision of effective medical care for people with various AIDS-related illnesses. In the thesis I demonstrate that another unavoidable dimension of the "New" South Africa is the traditional Bantu cult of the ancestors. I cite numerous reports showing that the cult is widely practiced, even by Christians. The ancestors are therefore an unavoidable dimension of the common religious understanding of life. If {{the meanings of}} salvation in the pandemic are being sought, then it would be a grave oversight not to consider how they relate to the cult of the ancestors. This research has shown that the cult of the ancestors makes a definite contribution to an understanding of salvation in the context of the pandemic in South Africa.

40|$|To date, {{only two}} {{references}} place {{members of the}} genus Diplocentrus in Sonora, Mexico. The first was a passing comment by Francke (1975) that D. spitzeri Stahnke occurs in northeastern Sonora. The specimens he examined and used in his systematic studies on that species {{are the same as}} the ones reported {{here for the first time}} from a specific Sonoran locality. The second reference was by Sissom and Walker (1992) listing a single record of D. gertschi Sissom and Walker from Libertad on the northern coast. Examination of material from the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), the California Academy of Sciences (CAS), and the Academy of Natural Sciences (ANS) indicates that, in addition to D. spitzeri and D. gertschi, another distinct species occurs in the Alamos and Navajoa areas in southern Sonora. This species is described as new below. It should be noted that a juvenile specimen from the vicinity of Benjamin Hill was also examined that was <b>unassignable</b> with certainty to any of the above species. This indicates that the genus has a wider distribution in Sonora than demonstrated even by the specimens listed in this report. Nomenclature and mensuration utilized herein essentially follows that of Stahnke (1970), with the following exceptions: carinal terminology and cheliceral measurements are after Francke (1975, 1977) and trichobothrial terminology is after Vachon (1974). Specimens in the senior author 2 ̆ 7 s collection are listed in the records sections as 2 ̆ 2 WDS”. Because D. spitzeri and the new species are both quite similar to D. peloncil 1 ensis Francke, the latter is included in the tables for comparison; in addition, the hemispermatophore of this species is also drawn. D. peloncillensis was described from only 6 males, 1 female, and 1 juvenile. The data presented here for D. peloncillensis are derived from these and new specimens available since the original description was published (Francke 1975), thereby providing a better understanding of variation in this species...|$|E
40|$|Paper aims to {{diagnose}} {{the role and}} position of reputation in communication strategies of contemporary enterprises together with pointing out certain solutions on the one hand, and to present the role of consumer social networks, often exploited by enterprises for more or less manipulative marketing actions. The analysis revealed, that reputation became both benchmark for different relations {{of social and economic}} actors, concerning exchange of information, opinions and expectations, and also played the role of controller of those mutual relations. Consistent reacting to expectations of important groups from institutional environment through the means of CSR rules seems, as practice proves, the best tool to build reputation of an enterprise. However, it is possible only on the condition that public declarations and voluntary commitments are fulfilled. This is because social perception, basing on real, not declarative, practices, the most important factor determining reputation. Text tries to prove that social responsibility of an enterprise, incorporated in marketing communication strategies together with <b>unassignable</b> and precious social and ethical motives, might be also used for legitimisation procedures, used mainly by big companies, for whom reputation and positive image might often have greater value than short term profits. On the other hand, the logics of contemporary Communications marketing, especially network one, demands appeal not only to features of goods and services in customer relations, but also appealing to their emotions and ethical consciousness. This way, fulfilling principles of CSR codes, mainly marketing goals are achieved, through manipulation of affections of customers and their broken dreams, and their inclination to overvalue business relations elaborated on the basis of confidentiality, trust and individual treatment. From the perspective of Communications marketing strategies applied by a company the client starts to play variety of roles: of adviser, expert, critic or advertiser of a company activities, and, as a result, the role o trustworthy business partner, bringing profit to numerous companies (image, reputation, trust), promoting the enterprises and their products among the other members of consumer community. On each step of those basic stages of creating and maintaining Internet consumer community might occur and often occurs manipulation of emotion, motivations and needs of clients...|$|E
40|$|To produce {{products}} with consistent quality, manufacturing processes {{need to be}} closely monitored for any deviations in the process. Proper analysis of control charts {{that are used to}} determine the state of the process not only requires a thorough knowledge and understanding of the underlying distribution theories associated with control charts, but also the experience of an expert in decision making. The present work proposes a modified backpropagation neural network methodology to identify and interpret various patterns of variations that can occur in a manufacturing process. Control charts primarily in the form of X-bar chart are widely used to identify the situations when control actions will be needed for manufacturing systems. Various types of patterns are observed in control charts. Identification of these control chart patterns (CCPs) can provide clues to potential quality problems in the manufacturing process. Each type of control chart pattern has its own geometric shape and various related features can represent this shape. This project formulates Shewhart mean (X-bar) and range (R) control charts for diagnosis and interpretation by artificial neural networks. Neural networks are trained to discriminate between samples from probability distributions considered within control limits and those which have shifted in both location and variance. Neural networks are also trained to recognize samples and predict future points from processes which exhibit long term or cyclical drift. The advantages and disadvantages of neural control charts compared to traditional statistical process control are iscussed. In processes, the causes of variations may be categorized as chance (<b>unassignable)</b> causes and special (assignable) causes. The variations due to chance causes are inevitable, and difficult to detect and identify. On the other hand, the variations due to special causes prevent the process being a stable and predictable. Such variations should be determined effectively and eliminated from the process by taking the necessary corrective actions to maintain the process in control and improve the quality of the products as well. In this study, a multilayered neural network trained with a back propagation algorithm was applied to pattern recognition on control charts. The neural network was experimented on a set of generated data...|$|E
