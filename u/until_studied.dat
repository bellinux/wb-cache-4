40|$|Gastrointestinal viruses {{were not}} found as an {{aetiology}} of culture-negative illness in NICU patients Bloodstream infections are a significant cause of mortality and morbidity in pre-mature and low-birth-weight infants; due to non-specific manifestations, ‘rule out sepsis ’ evaluations are commonly per-formed in the age group. After evaluation, broad spectrum antibiotics are adminis-tered while awaiting the results of bacter-ial cultures that have a yield of not more than 25 %– 27 %. 1 2 Viral causes of sepsis-like syndromes in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) have been underexplored, especially in the PCR era. Because {{a large majority of}} putatively septic episodes fail to yield a bacterial pathogen, we hypothesised that culture-negative septic episodes in very low-birth-weight NICU patients might have a viral origin. The objective {{of the study was to}} iden-tify non-respiratory viral causes of sepsis-like illness. Infants enrolled in this study were part of a prospective ongoing study evaluating all infants born with a weight less than 1500 g and hospitalised in the NICU at St Louis Children’s Hospital immediately after birth for necrotising enterocolitis. Stools were collected from all enrolled infants from the time of birth until their discharge as often as possible, and stored at − 80 °C <b>until</b> <b>studied.</b> Subjects bor...|$|E
40|$|Multigene phylogenies {{have been}} {{instrumental}} in revising the classification of ascosporic (teleomorph) yeasts in a natural system based on lines of descent. Although many taxonomic changes have already been implemented for teleomorph taxa, this is not yet {{the case for the}} large genus Candida and smaller anascosporic (anamorph) genera. In view of the recently introduced requirement that a fungal species or higher taxon be assigned only a single valid name under the new International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code), the current species of Candida and other anamorph yeast genera must undergo revision to make genus membership consistent with phylogenetic affinities. A review of existing data and analyses shows that certain Candida species may be assigned to teleomorph genera with high confidence using multigene phylogenies. Candida species that form well-circumscribed phylogenetic clades without any teleomorph member justify the creation of new genera. However, a considerable number of Candida species sit at the end of isolated and often long branches, and hence cannot be assigned to larger species groups. They should be maintained in Candida sensu lato <b>until</b> <b>studied</b> by multigene analyses in datasets with comprehensive taxon sampling. The principle of name stability has to be honoured to the largest extent compatible with a natural classification of Candida species. © 2014 Springer International Publishing...|$|E
40|$|Chronic hyperoxia {{during the}} first 1 – 4 {{postnatal}} weeks attenuates the hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR) subsequently measured in adult rats. Rather than focusing on this long-lasting plasticity, the present study considered the influence of hyperoxia on respiratory control during the neonatal period. Sprague-Dawley rats were {{born and raised in}} 60 % O 2 <b>until</b> <b>studied</b> at postnatal ages (P) of 4, 6 – 7, or 13 – 14 days. Ventilation and metabolism were measured in normoxia (21 % O 2) and acute hypoxia (12 % O 2) using head-body plethysmography and respirometry, respectively. Compared with age-matched rats raised in room air, the major findings were 1) diminished pulmonary ventilation and metabolic O 2 consumption in normoxia at P 4 and P 6 – 7; 2) decreased breathing stability during normoxia; 3) attenuation of the early phase of the HVR at P 6 – 7 and P 13 – 14; and 4) a sustained increase in ventilation during hypoxia (vs. the normal biphasic HVR) at all ages studied. Attenuation of the early HVR likely reflects progressive impairment of peripheral arterial chemoreceptors while expression of a sustained HVR in neonates before P 7 suggests that hyperoxia also induces plasticity within the central nervous system. Together, these results suggest a complex interaction between inhibitory and excitatory effects of hyperoxia on the developing respiratory control system...|$|E

40|$|There is convincing {{evidence}} that imbalance between angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors {{play an important role}} in the pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia. Angiogenin, a member of the RNase A super family, is a potent inducer of angiogenesis and serum levels are shown to be elevated in pre-eclampsia. We hypothesize that placental expression of angiogenin inhibitor which binds and blocks the activity of angiogenin is altered in pre-eclampsia and may play a role in its pathophysiology. Placental expression of angiogenin inhibitor was measured in term placentae of 15 women with preeclampsia and 16 normal pregnant controls. The women were matched for age, parity and gestational age. Placental tissue was collected immediately after delivery and stored at - 80 °C <b>until</b> <b>studied.</b> Angiogenin inhibitor gene expression was measured using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (rt-QPCR). The results were standardized using the glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as reference gene. The mRNA expression of angiogenin inhibitor gene was significantly increased in preeclamptic placentae compared to normal pregnant controls [0. 44 (0. 174 - 1. 048) versus 0. 091 (0. 029 - 0. 301), median and interquatile range, p= 0. 027 for pre-eclampsia and normal controls respectively]. There was no correlation between angiogenin inhibitor gene expression and maternal age, blood pressure, platelet count, gestation age, birth weight of the baby in pre-eclampsia and normal pregnancy. This study showed that placental expression of the angiogenin inhibitor gene is significantly increased in pre-eclampsia and may play a role in its pathophysiology...|$|E
40|$|Rats {{reared in}} hyperoxia hypoventilate in normoxia and exhibit {{progressive}} blunting of the hypoxic ventilatory response, changes which {{are at least}} partially attributed to abnormal carotid body development. Since the carotid body also responds to changes in arterial CO 2 /pH, we tested the hypothesis that developmental hyperoxia would attenuate the hypercapnic ventilatory response (HCVR) of neonatal rats by blunting peripheral and/or central chemoreceptor responses to hypercapnic challenges. Rats were reared in 21 % O 2 (Control) or 60 % O 2 (Hyperoxia) <b>until</b> <b>studied</b> at 4, 6 – 7, or 13 – 14 days of age. Hyperoxia rats had significantly reduced single-unit carotid chemoafferent responses to 15 % CO 2 at all ages; CO 2 sensitivity recovered within 7 days after return to room air. Hypercapnic responses of CO 2 -sensitive neurons of the caudal nucleus tractus solitarius (cNTS) were unaffected by chronic hyperoxia, but there was evidence for a small decrease in neuronal excitability. There was also evidence for augmented excitatory synaptic input to cNTS neurons within brainstem slices. Steady-state ventilatory responses to 4 % and 8 % CO 2 were unaffected by developmental hyperoxia in all three age groups, but ventilation increased more slowly during the normocapnia-to-hypercapnia transition in 4 -day-old Hyperoxia rats. We conclude that developmental hyperoxia impairs carotid body chemosensitivity to hypercapnia, and this may compromise protective ventilatory reflexes during dynamic respiratory challenges in newborn rats. Impaired carotid body function has less of {{an impact on the}} HCVR in older rats, potentially reflecting compensatory plasticity within the CNS...|$|E

It has been successfully applied for the New World screwworm fly (NWSF), Cochliomyia hominivorax but remains unproven for the Old World screwworm fly (OWSF), Chrysomya bezziana. The aim {{of the study was to}} develop methods for investigating mating behaviour and mating compatibility of C. bezziana under laboratory conditions. Two methods were used for studying mating: individual mating (method 1) and group mating (method 2). The flies used in this study were 5 - 7 days old. Twenty four hours after emergence, adult flies were sexed and placed into different cages <b>until</b> <b>studied.</b> The female : male ratio in the group mating was 1 : 5 and the males were marked by painting a dot on the thorax using different oil colours. Observation of mating behaviour was investigated every 30 minutes through 10 - 20 replications for all methods depending on the availability of flies. Data were analysed using ANOVA and the Student’s t-test, with significance demonstrated at the 95 % confidence level. The results demonstrated that the frequency of contacts between males and females at different ages was a significantly different (p 0. 05) and method 2 (p > 0. 05). Copulation was only initiated following longer periods of contact, mainly in the range of 270 - 449 seconds. The highest frequency of copulation occurred between 7 - 8 days, but the duration of mating was similar between 5 - 8 days old. The study demonstrated that the methods developed were suitable for a mating compatibility study of C. bezziana...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} 1, 2, and 3 wk of hindlimb {{suspension}} (HS) on force-velocity and power characteristics of single rat soleus fibers were determined. After 1, 2, or 3 wk of HA, small fiber bundles were isolated, placed in skinning solution, and stored at - 20 C <b>until</b> <b>studied.</b> Single fibers were isolated and placed between a motor arm and force transducer, functional properties were studied, and fiber protein content was subsequently analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Additional fibers were isolated from soleus of control after 1 and 3 wk of HS, and fiber type distribution and myosin light chain stoichiometry were determined from SDS-PAGE analysis. After 1 wk of HS, percent type I fibers declined from 82 to 74 %, whereas hybrid fibers increased from 10 to 18 %. Percent fast type II fibers increased from 8 % {{in control and}} 1 wk of HS to 26 % by 3 wk of HS. Most fibers showed an increased unloaded maximal shortening velocity (V sub O)), but myosin heavy chain remained entirely slow type I. The mechanism for increased V(sub O) is unknown. There was a progressive decrease in fiber diameter and peak force after 1, 2, and 3 wk of HS, respectively. One week of HS resulted in a shift of the force-velocity curve, and between 2 and 3 wk of HS the curve shifted further such that V(sub O) was higher than control at all relative loads less than 45 % peak isometric force. Peak absolute power output of soleus fibers progressively decreased through 2 wk of HS but showed no further change at 3 wk. The results suggest that between 2 and 3 wk the HS-induced alterations in the force-velocity relationship act to maintain the power output of single soleus fibers despite a continued reduction in fiber force...|$|E
