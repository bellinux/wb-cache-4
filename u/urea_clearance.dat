40|$|Effect of {{intraperitoneal}} neostigmine on peritoneal transport {{characteristics in}} CAPD. Lymphatics {{have been suggested}} {{to play a major}} role in the absorption of dialysate, which consequently affects the adequacy of peritoneal dialysis. Neostigmine has been found to decrease lymphatic absorption in rats, presumably by causing constriction of the lymphatic stomata. We investigated the effect of neostigmine on seven continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients in a prospective study. We performed modified peritoneal equilibration tests both with and without intraperitoneal neostigmine in a random order. Radiolabeled albumin (0. 8 mg) was added to 2 liters of dialysate ± 2. 0 mg neostigmine. We evaluated ultrafiltration and creatinine, phosphate, and <b>urea</b> <b>clearances.</b> The dialysate bag and the peritoneum were scanned at the initiation and conclusion of the four-hour dwell period. We found no change in ultrafiltration, residual volumes, creatinine, phosphate and <b>urea</b> <b>clearances,</b> or albumin recovered.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of a hemodialyzer is largely dependent on ifs ability to facilitate diffusion, {{since this is}} the main mechanism by which small solutes are removed. The diffusion process can be impaired {{if there is a}} mismatch between blood and dialysate flow distribution in the dialyzer. The objective of the paper was to study the impact of different dialysate compartment designs on dialysate flow distribution and <b>urea</b> <b>clearances.</b> Eighteen hollow fiber 1. 3 m(2) hemodialyzers were studied, 6 each of 3 designs: Type A - standard fiber bundle (PAN 65 DX Asahi Medical, Tokyo, Japan), Type B - spacing filaments external to the fibers (PAN 65 SF Asahi Medical, Tokyo, Japan), Type C - fibers waved to give Moire structure (FB 130 Nissho-Nipro, Osaka, Japan). In vitro studies: 3 dialyzers of each type were studied following dye injection into the dialysate compartment. Dynamic sequential imaging of longitudinal sections of the dialyzer were undertaken, using a new generation helical CT scanner (X-Press/HS 1 Toshiba Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). In vivo studies: 3 dialyzers of each type were studied, in randomized sequence, in 3 different patients under standardized dialysis conditions. Blood- and dialysate-side <b>urea</b> <b>clearances</b> were measured at 30 and 150 minutes of treatment. Macroscopic and densitometrical analysis revealed that flow distribution was most homogeneous in the dialyzer with Moire structure (Type C) and least homogeneous in the standard dialyzer (Type A). Space yarns (Type B) gave an intermediate dialysate flow distribution. Significantly increased <b>urea</b> <b>clearances</b> (p< 0. 001) were seen with Types B and C, compared to the standard dialyzer. Type C (Moire) had the highest clearances although these were not significantly greater than Type B (space yarns). In conclusion, more homogeneous dialysate flow distribution and improved small solute clearances can be achieved by use of spacing yarns or waved (Moire structure) patterns of fiber packing in the dialyzer. These effects are achieved probably as a result of reduced dialysate channeling resulting in a lower degree of mismatch between blood and dialysate flows. The new radiological technique using the helical CT scanner allows detailed flow distribution analysis and has the potential for testing future modifications to dialyzer design...|$|R

40|$|Background: Dialysis {{patients}} {{are at risk}} of vitamin and mineral deficiencies, not only because of losses during chronic hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis but also because of low intakes. Objective: The objective was to determine the importance of <b>urea</b> <b>clearance</b> (calculated as K t/V) and residual renal function (RRF) in predicting micronutrient intakes in a large cohort of patients receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Design: We conducted a survey of dietary intakes in 242 CAPD patients and divided them into 3 groups according to their weekly <b>urea</b> <b>clearance</b> and RRF: WD group (n = 84), a <b>urea</b> <b>clearance</b> ≥ 1. 7 and a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥ 1 mL · min - 1 · 1. 73 m - 2; DD group (n = 71), a <b>urea</b> <b>clearance</b> ≥ 1. 7 and a GFR < 1 mL · min - 1 · 1. 73 m - 2; and ID group (n = 87), a <b>urea</b> <b>clearance</b> < 1. 7. Results: Most of the patients had intakes of water-soluble vitamins and minerals that were lower than the recommended dietary allowance; most intakes were significantly higher in the WD group than in the DD and ID groups, except those of niacin and calcium. After age, sex, body weight, and the presence of diabetes were controlled for, total weekly <b>urea</b> <b>clearance</b> and the GFR (but not peritoneal dialysis <b>urea</b> <b>clearance)</b> were significantly associated with intakes of vitamins A and C, the B vitamins, and minerals (calcium, phosphate, iron, and zinc). Low intakes of vitamins and minerals with low RRF and <b>urea</b> <b>clearance</b> were the result of reduced overall food intakes, except for thiamine, vitamin B- 6, and folic acid, which were deficient in the diet. Conclusions: Supplementation with most water-soluble vitamins and minerals, including iron and zinc, should be considered in CAPD patients, especially those with low RRF and low <b>urea</b> <b>clearance.</b> The optimal dose needs to be determined.

Previous equations to estimate stdKt/V were derived using a fixed-volume model. To determine the impact of fluid removal as well as residual <b>urea</b> <b>clearance</b> on stdKt/V, we modeled 245 hemodialysis sessions (including conventional 3 /week, in-center 6 /week, and at-home nocturnal 6 /week) in 210 patients enrolled in the Frequent Hemodialysis Network Daily and Nocturnal clinical trials. To examine the role of fluid removal, modeled stdKt/V was compared to stdKt/V estimated from a previously published simplified equation. In a subgroup of 45 sessions with residual <b>urea</b> <b>clearance</b> over 1. 5 ml/min, the contribution of residual <b>urea</b> <b>clearance</b> to stdKt/V was measured. For all dialysis schedules, the fixed-volume equation predicted stdKt/V well when both fluid removal and residual <b>urea</b> <b>clearance</b> were set to zero. When fluid removal was included, modeled stdKt/V was slightly underestimated for all three modes of hemodialysis. The shortfall correlated directly with weekly fluid removal and inversely with modeled urea volume.

40|$|Longitudinal {{relationship}} between solute transport and ultrafiltration capacity in peritoneal dialysis patients. BackgroundTime on treatment {{is associated with}} a greater risk of impaired ultrafiltration (UF) in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. In addition to increasing solute transport, a potentially treatable cause of impaired ultrafiltration, cross-sectional studies suggest that there is also reduced osmotic conductance of the membrane. If this were the case then it would be expected that the UF capacity for a given rate of solute transport would change with time. The purpose of this analysis was to establish how solute transport and UF capacity change relative to one another with time on therapy. MethodsMembrane function, using a standard peritoneal equilibration test, was measured at least annually in a well-characterized, single-center observational cohort of PD patients between 1990 and 2003. Demography included age, gender, original cause of renal failure, body surface area (BSA), validated comorbidity score, residual urine volume and <b>urea</b> <b>clearances,</b> peritoneal <b>urea</b> <b>clearances,</b> and plasma albumin. ResultsData from 574 new PD patients were available for analysis. Independent demographic factors associated with higher solute transport at baseline were male gender and higher residual urine volume. Throughout time on therapy there was a negative {{relationship between}} solute transport and UF capacity and a significant increase and decrease in these parameters, respectively. During the first 12 months of treatment, the increase in solute transport was not associated with the expected fall in UF capacity, a phenomenon that was not explained by informative censoring, but was associated with an increased, albeit weak, correlation with BSA. In contrast, later in treatment there was a disproportionate fall in UF capacity, more accelerated in patients developing UF failure. Early exposure to higher intraperitoneal glucose concentrations, in the context of more comorbidity and relative lack of residual renal function, was associated with more rapid deterioration in membrane function. ConclusionDespite a causal link between solute transport and UF capacity of the membrane, due to the effect of the former on the osmotic gradient, there is evidence of their longitudinal dissociation. This implies a change in the structure-function relationship with time on treatment that can, to some extent, be predicted from clinical factors present within the first year of treatment.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the effect of hyperlipoproteinemia on the {{biodistribution}} of cyclosporine A (CyA), an extensively lipoprotein bound immunosuppressant, in a rat model and to determine the potential toxicological significance of this effect. Normolipidemic and hyperlipoproteinemic rats were given a single 5 mg/kg dose of CyA as intravenous bolus and at selected times postdose, tissues, blood, and plasma were harvested and assayed for CyA content. Hyperlipoproteinemia was induced by intraperitoneal injection of 1 g/kg poloxamer 407. Compared with normolipidemic animals, hyperlipoproteinemic rats had higher plasma, blood, kidney, and liver CyA concentrations. In contrast, in heart and spleen the concentrations were decreased in hyperlipoproteinemia. The nephrotoxic effect of CyA was also evaluated in normolipidemic and hyperlipoproteinemic rats after 7 days of dosing with 20 mg/kg/day. In both groups of animals, repeated doses of CyA were associated with equivalent decreases in creatinine and <b>urea</b> <b>clearances</b> compared with matching control and predose baseline measures. The concentrations of drug in kidney were equivalent at the conclusion of the study. However, despite these similarities there was microscopic evidence of more severe changes in the kidneys in the hyperlipoproteinemic rats, which also experienced a significant decrease in body weight compared with the normolipedemic animals. In conclusion, the distribution of CyA to kidneys was enhanced in poloxamer 407 -induced hyperlipoproteinemic rats after single doses, and with repeated doses there was an apparent greater adverse effect on these animals compared with normolipidemic animals...|$|R
40|$|The {{use of a}} presterilized, disposable, mesh-supported {{membrane}} {{envelope in}} the Watson Marlow Kiil dialyser results in a 12 % improvement in <b>urea</b> and creatinine <b>clearance.</b> Priming volume, uptake volume, and ultrafiltration rate are unchanged. Residual blood volume remains small. Blood flow resistance is increased. The envelope therefore offers considerable advantages over conventional assembly for dialysis with a blood pump...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Using brief {{episodes of}} {{ischemia}} and reperfusion (IR) {{prior to a}} more sustained IR insult – ischemic preconditioning (IPC) – can reduce IR injury of the heart, brain and many other tissues. The purpose of {{present study was to}} investigate the effect of 2 min ischemic periods on subsequent rat renal IR injury. Methods: Male rat's renal IR injury was investigated in a right nephrectomized model. For this purpose plasma creatinine (Cr) and <b>urea,</b> creatinine <b>clearance,</b> fractional excretion of sodium and histological injury score (Jablonski score; 0 - 4) were compared among these groups: IR group (40 min of renal ischemia – followed by 24 h reperfusion), sham group (no IR) and IPC group (3 times of 2 min ischemia – 5 min reperfusion before 40 min of renal ischemia – followed by 24 h reperfusion). Results: Necrosis score was significantly lower in IPC than IR group and cases with Jablonski score = 4 were significantly less frequent in IPC group compared to IR group (11. 1 % vs. 75 %). Plasma Cr and <b>urea,</b> creatinine <b>clearance</b> and fractional excretion of sodium were not significantly different between IPC and IR groups. Cases with plasma urea levels higher than 190 mg/dl and also cases with fractional excretion of sodium beyond 2 % were significantly less frequent in IPC group compared to IR group. Conclusion: Using three times of " 2 min ischemia– 5 min reperfusion" before the injurious ischemic insult can reduce rat renal histological injury and relatively attenuate functional renal injury...|$|R
