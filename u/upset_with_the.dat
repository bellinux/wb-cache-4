5|$|In 1924 {{the family}} moved to Mount Vernon, New York, a popular Jewish area of Westchester County. Nevelson was <b>upset</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> move, which removed her from city life and her artistic environment. During the winter of 1932–1933 she {{separated}} from Charles, unwilling to becoming the socialite wife he expected her to be. She never sought financial support from Charles, and in 1941 the couple divorced.|$|E
5|$|Later, Samantha {{reveals that}} the OSes are leaving, and {{describes}} a space beyond the physical world. They lovingly say goodbye, and then she is gone. Theodore, changed by the experience, is shown {{for the first time}} writing a letter in his own voice―to his ex-wife Catherine, expressing apology, acceptance and gratitude. Theodore then sees Amy, who is <b>upset</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> departure of the OS that she had befriended, and they go to the roof of their apartment building where they sit down together and watch the sun rise over the city.|$|E
5|$|The now-traditional {{third place}} {{play-off}} was not established until 1934, so {{the format of}} the 1930 World Cup is unique in not distinguishing between the third and fourth placed teams. Occasional sources, notably a FIFA Bulletin from 1984, incorrectly imply that a third-place match occurred and was won 3–1 by Yugoslavia. Accounts differ as to whether a third-place match was originally scheduled. According to a 2009 book by Hyder Jawad, Yugoslavia refused to play a third-place match because they were <b>upset</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> refereeing in their semi-final against Uruguay.|$|E

5000|$|Robert Coover has an [...] "affinity for the grotesque." [...] Readers, as {{repressed}} and submissive human beings, tend to resist, flee, {{and fear}} {{the attitudes and}} myths of age, death, {{and other aspects of}} life; Hume indicated that, [...] "By yoking <b>the</b> gross or <b>upsetting</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ordinary, <b>the</b> comic <b>with</b> <b>the</b> tragic, Coover forces awareness of the cultural limits we have sublimated." [...] Therefore, Coover [...] "breaks the mechanisms of repression, reintroduces awareness of our submission, and tries to awaken us to the nature of our situation." ...|$|R
50|$|Of the 32 matches played, 5 were <b>upsets</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> lower seeded player {{beating the}} higher seeded player and 7 matches were halved.

5|$|Three {{years after}} the {{toppling}} of the Provisional Government by the Bolsheviks in October 1917, the Red Army invaded the southern Caucasus republics of Azerbaijan, Georgia and Armenia. In May 1920, Bagramyan, <b>upset</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> country's social and political conditions, participated in a failed rebellion against the Dashnak-led government of Armenia. He was jailed and sent {{to work in the}} fields for several months but was allowed to rejoin the military with the outbreak of the Turkish–Armenian War. But in December 1920, Armenia was sovietized and the national army was subsequently disbanded. Bagramyan, however, chose to join the 11th Soviet Army and was appointed a cavalry regiment commander.|$|E
5|$|According to French {{intelligence}} reports, the Turks sent political {{agents to}} northern Syria {{to persuade the}} inhabitants to drop their armed resistance to the French and embrace French rule, which they claimed would benefit the population. Sometime between April and May, Hananu had Uwaid execute field commander Mustafa Asim Bey for his involvement in an attack against the mostly Christian town of al-Suqaylabiyah, in which many of its inhabitants were killed. Asim Bey was a strongly pro-Ottoman, Arab officer with particularly close connections to the Anatolian insurgency. Hananu believed that the Turks had instructed him {{to carry out the}} raids on al-Suqaylabiyah and other villages to tarnish the image of the rebels among the local inhabitants, as part of Turkey's agreements with France to stifle the revolt in northern Syria. Asim's execution {{may have contributed to the}} rapid withdrawal of the rebels' Turkish military advisers who were <b>upset</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> execution.|$|E
5|$|For his part, Minh resented that he {{had been}} deposed by a younger officer whom he viewed as an unscrupulous upstart. Minh was also <b>upset</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{detention}} of his fellow generals and around 30 of his junior officers. The latter group was set free when Minh made this a condition for his serving as the figurehead chief of state. Khánh attempted to avoid the issue of substantiating the alleged neutralist plot {{for as long as he}} could, and then tried to revive it by claiming that French agents were attempting to assassinate him and to enforce neutralism. Khánh offered no evidence, only claiming that the French had paid a hitman US$1300 to kill him, before later inflating the supposed reward for his assassination. American intelligence officials in Vietnam privately said that they were not aware of any such threat.|$|E
50|$|This tournament was {{notable for}} {{the high number of}} <b>upsets,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> higher seed winning only twice in the first two rounds, and the 11 and 12 seeds {{progressing}} to the semifinals. The championship game matched Duke against Georgia Tech. It was the third time a team has played 4 games (NC State in 1997 and 2007). Duke won the championship game, 65-61, to win its 9th ACC championship in 12 years. Duke {{went on to win the}} national championship.|$|R

When she sees Becca reading adoption literature {{and that she}} is <b>upset</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> baby's father, Liz realizes this may be her chance to adopt a baby. Liz creates a job for Becca as the TGS with Tracy Jordan youth consultant. Liz believes that encouraging Becca to follow her dream as a singer will lead her {{to give up her}} baby to Liz. However, when Becca's boyfriend, Tim (Christopher Nicholas Smith), comes to the 30 Rock building, Liz realizes that Becca and Tim should be together so that they can raise their child together, and tells them to make their relationship work.|$|E
5|$|Parrish, <b>upset</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{ineffectiveness}} of the association, proposed {{forming a}} players' union, {{that would be}} independent of the NFLPA, {{with the assistance of}} the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT). The IBT pushed for the NFLPA to join the trucking union. In early November 1967, Parrish, with support from former Cleveland Browns player Jim Brown, began distributing union cards to form a Teamsters affiliate known as the American Federation of Pro Athletes. The NFLPA rejected the overture at its meeting in Hollywood, Florida, during the first week of January 1968 and declared itself an independent union. Although Parrish's proposal was defeated, Miller left his position as counsel to the union. He was later replaced by two Chicago labor lawyers, Dan Schulman and Bernie Baum.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Van in 1846, {{he married}} Mariam Sevikian. In 1847 he crossed to Persia and the Russian Caucasus, where {{he visited the}} Ararat plain, Shirak, and Nakhichevan. He lived in Alexandropol (Gyumri) for six months. In 1848 once again moved to Constantinople via Tiflis, Batumi, and Trabzon. From 1848 to 1850 he taught at an all-girl school in Constantinople's Khasgiugh (Hasköy) quarter. In 1851 he {{traveled}} to Cilicia where {{he was sent to}} report on the state of Armenian schools. By traveling and living in various Armenian-populated provinces, he acquired an intimate knowledge of the problems and aspirations of ordinary Armenians. He was <b>upset</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> apathy the upper and middle classes of the Armenian community of Constantinople showed towards provincial Armenians.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} deploy {{successfully}} commercially-off-the- shelf SRAM-based FPGA devices in safety- or mission-critical ap- plications, designers need to adopt suitable hardening techniques, {{as well as}} methods for validating the correctness of the obtained designs, {{as far as the}} system's dependability is concerned. In this paper we describe a new analytical approach to estimate the de- pendability of TMR designs implemented on SRAM-based FPGAs that, by exploiting a detailed knowledge of FPGAs architectures and configuration memory, is able to predict the effects of single event <b>upsets</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> same accuracy of fault injection but at a frac- tion of the fault-injection's execution time...|$|R

5|$|Towel Power is a {{term used}} by the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League (NHL) to {{describe}} the waving of rally towels by their fans. The tradition started in the 1982 Campbell Conference Finals when Vancouver played the Chicago Blackhawks. During game two of the series, head coach Roger Neilson waved a white towel {{on the end of}} a hockey stick in a mock surrender after being <b>upset</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> officiating. Neilson was ejected and the Canucks lost 4–1. When Vancouver returned home from Chicago for the following game fans supported both Neilson and the Canucks by waving towels first at the airport when the team arrived and then during the next game. The Canucks won the next three games and advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals where they were defeated by the New York Islanders. As part of the tradition, the Canucks hand out towels prior to playoff games for fans to help support the team.|$|E
5|$|Magnavox {{designed}} {{the exterior of}} the machine, and re-engineered some the internals with some consultation from Baer and Harrison; they removed the ability to display color, used only the three dial controller, and changed the system of selecting games from a dial to separate game cards that modified the console's circuitry when plugged into the console. At the time, color televisions were still seen as a luxury item, and the ability to show color would have added additional expense and time spent dealing with FCC testing and regulations. The internal circuitry had been designed with discrete components rather than integrated circuits due to cost concerns; these concerns were no longer valid by 1971, but Magnavox did not have enough time to redesign every internal component of the machine prior to the planned production start date. Magnavox named the console first as the Skill-O-Vision while testing, and then released it as the Odyssey. The rifle game was turned into a separately sold add-on game, Shooting Gallery, and Magnavox added paper money, playing cards, and poker chips to the console, {{to go along with the}} plastic overlays for the games that enhanced the primitive visuals. The new additions helped raise the price of the console to US$99.99. Baer was <b>upset</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> board game additions, which he felt were pointless add-ons that would go unused by players. Magnavox announced the system's launch date of September 1972, and demonstrated it for months prior to Magnavox dealerships and media.|$|E
5|$|The tenth season closes several long-running storylines. Charlie {{breaks up}} with Ross {{to get back}} {{together}} with her ex-boyfriend. Joey and Rachel try to contend with Ross' feelings about them being together and decide {{it would be best}} to remain friends. Phoebe and Mike get married mid-season outside the Central Perk coffee house. Monica and Chandler apply to adopt a child and are chosen by Erica (Anna Faris). In the series finale, Erica gives birth to twins, to the surprise of Monica and Chandler— a boy, Jack (after Monica's father), and a girl, Erica (named after the birth mother). Monica and Chandler prepare to move to the suburbs, and Joey becomes <b>upset</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> changes in his life. Rachel gets fired from her job and accepts a new offer in Paris, but Ross, realizing he loves her, chases after her. Rachel realizes she loves him, too, and cancels her flight to Paris, agreeing to stay with him. The series ends with all the friends plus Monica and Chandler's new babies leaving the apartment, heading to Central Perk for a final cup of coffee. The finale dialogue used in this series is by Chandler, making a joke for the last time. The camera's last view is of all of the character's keys to the apartment on the counter table, finishing with a shot of the apartment door.|$|E
50|$|The group stages {{featured}} {{a number of}} surprising <b>upsets,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> top three seeds all struggling to remain in contention. Anand, the No. 1 seed, overcame an early loss to Krishnan Sasikaran with wins over Kasimdzhanov and Al-Modiahki to finish second in his group. Vassily Ivanchuk was less fortunate, dropping games to Malakhov and Macieja and finishing fifth in Group A. Morozevich never recovered after suffering a disastrous start with three straight losses to Ehlvest, Ganguly, and Harikrishna. He scored only one point in five matches, finishing second-to-last in the entire tournament and dropping below 2700 in Elo rating {{for the first time}} since 1998.|$|R

5|$|Wyler felt Tunberg's {{draft was}} too much of a {{morality}} play overlaid with current Western political overtones, and that the dialogue was too modern-sounding. Zimbalist brought in playwright S. N. Behrman (who also wrote the script for Quo Vadis) and then playwright Maxwell Anderson to write drafts. Gore Vidal biographer Fred Kaplan states that British poet and playwright Christopher Fry was hired simultaneously with Vidal, although most sources (including Vidal himself) state that Vidal followed Anderson, and that Fry did not come aboard until Vidal was close to leaving the picture. Vidal arrived in Rome in early March 1958 to meet with Wyler. Vidal claimed that Wyler had not read the script, and that when he did so (at Vidal's urging) on his flight from the U.S. to Italy, he was <b>upset</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> modernist dialogue. Vidal agreed to work on the script for three months so that he would come off suspension and fulfill his contract with MGM, although Zimbalist pushed him to stay throughout the entire production. Vidal was researching a book on the 4th century Roman emperor Julian and knew a great deal about ancient Rome.|$|E
