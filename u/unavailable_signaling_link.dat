40|$|Signalling is the {{critical}} component of telecommunications networks. Thus {{the design of the}} signalling system is a fundamental issue for the creation of the future Broadband ISDN out of ATM switching technology. Today 2 ̆ 7 s telecommunication networks use common channel signalling networks (standardised in SS 7) which are often separate from the bearer or transport network. With an ATM based Broadband ISDN (B-ISDN), it is anticipated that both signalHng and user traffic will share the underlying ATM layer. An SS 7 2 ̆ 2 Message Transfer Part 2 ̆ 2 (MTP) provides reliable connectionless signalling message transport. However due to differences between SS 7 <b>links</b> and ATM <b>signalling</b> <b>links</b> (i. e. ATM Virtual Channel Connections (VCCs)), a new MTP will be needed for B-ISDN. This thesis is concerned with the design and engineering of the B-ISDN MTP The need for an ATM <b>signalling</b> <b>link</b> error monitor is identified as a key requirement. To design such an error monitor, the delay performance of ATM <b>signalling</b> <b>links</b> during errored periods must be determined. This requires a model for the delay performance of the Service Specific Connection Oriented Protocol (SSCOP), the link level protocol to be used on ATM <b>signalling</b> <b>links.</b> The thesis presents an SSCOP delay model, which also gives general results for mean Selective Repeat transmitter delay and the mean (and distribution) of Selective Repeat receiver delay...|$|R

40|$|Cooperative {{transmission}} {{has been}} gaining enormous attention recently where users share their resources for an overall improved performance. In this work, coded cooperation is of interest where a novel strategy is proposed with remarkable performance under various scenarios. In contrast to conventional works that focus on cooperative diversity, the proposed scheme successfully explores further coding benefits even when cooperative diversity is physically <b>unavailable.</b> <b>Signal</b> space diversity is also exploited for better cooperative diversity achievement. Imperfect inter-user channels are considered as well where the detrimental error propagation issue due to cooperative coding on erroneously detected messages is solved. Impressive mutual benefit is achieved for users with or without detection problems on their partners' messages. © 2007 IEEE...|$|R

50|$|A Signal Transfer Point (STP) is {{a router}} that relays SS7 {{messages}} between signaling end-points (SEPs) and other signaling transfer points (STPs). Typical SEPs include service switching points (SSPs) and service control points (SCPs). The STP {{is connected to}} adjacent SEPs and STPs via <b>signaling</b> <b>links.</b> Based on the address fields of the SS7 messages, the STP routes the messages to the appropriate outgoing <b>signaling</b> <b>link.</b> Edge STPs can also route based upon message body content using deep packet inspection techniques, and can provide address translations and screen content to limit the transfer of messages with dubious content or sent from unreliable sources. To meet stringent reliability requirements, STPs are typically provisioned in mated pairs.|$|R

50|$|When {{operating}} in the quasi-associated mode, SS7 signaling progresses from the originating switch to the terminating switch, following a path through a separate SS7 signaling network composed of signal transfer points.
