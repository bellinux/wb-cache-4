5000|$|One {{group of}} {{scholars}} has suggested a strategy they call race treason to offset white privilege, related to {{articles published in}} the journal Race Traitor. The adherents' main argument is that whiteness (as a marker of a social status within the United States) is conferred upon people in exchange for an expectation of loyalty to an oppressive social order. Such loyalty has been expressed in different forms: suppression of slave rebellions, participation in patrols for runaways, maintenance of race-exclusionary <b>unions,</b> <b>participation</b> in riots, support for racist violence, and participation in conflict during the conquest of western North America. Like currency, the value of this privilege (for the powerful) depends on the reliability of [...] "white skin" [...] (or as physical anthropologists would deem this construct, the phenotype of historical North Atlantic Europeans) as a marker for social consent. With sufficient [...] "counterfeit whites" [...] resisting racism and capitalism, the writers in this tradition argue, the privilege will be withdrawn or will splinter, prompting an era of conflict and social redefinition. Without such a period, they argue, progress towards social justice is impossible, and thus the principle [...] "treason to whiteness is loyalty to humanity." ...|$|R

5000|$|Many {{members from}} The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) joined labor unions {{such as the}} Noble Order of the Knights of Labor and Mormon {{participation}} in the labor movement was {{at an all-time high}} in the 1880s. By {{the turn of the century}} LDS Church officials adopted capitalism as their economic system to better transition into becoming a state within the United States. Utah’s acceptance of capitalism brought on a new wave of anti-unionism. Church leaders who weren’t necessarily comfortable with the principles of union membership welcomed the change to capitalism and actively opposed <b>union</b> <b>participation</b> to their church congregations. The narrative supporting unionism began to shift as church leaders would associate <b>union</b> <b>participation</b> as a violation of the doctrine of [...] "free agency." [...] LDS Church policy began to reflect the sentiments of the Utah Fuel Company and Mormon members accepted the narrative against the Carbon County Strikes. The general authority of the church came to the aid of coal companies by encouraging their congregations to protest the Carbon County Strike and act as strikebreakers at mine sites. For the Utah Fuel Company, influencing the densely populated Mormon community was critical in there effort refute the unions. Mormons feared the violent tendencies of the Colorado strikes and associated the Utah labor movement with hostile nature of Colorado union members. Most members in the LDS Church lost sympathy for the Carbon County strikers and the association with Colorado strikes proved to be a liability for their cause.|$|E
