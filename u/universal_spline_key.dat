Based {{on the concept}} of <b>universal</b> <b>splines</b> we obtain geometric constructions for both the spline control points and for the B'ezier points and give algorithms for computing locally supported basis functions and for knot insertion.

40|$|Abstract: Kriging is a nonparametric {{regression}} method used in geostatistics for estimating curves and surfaces for spatial data. It {{may come as}} a surprise that the Kriging estimator, normally derived as the best linear unbiased estimator, is also the solution of a particular variational problem. Thus, Kriging estimators can also be interpreted as generalized smoothing splines where the roughness penalty is determined by the covariance function of a spatial process. We build off the early work by Silverman (1982, 1984) and the analysis by Cox (1983, 1984), Messer (1991), Messer and Goldstein (1993) and others and develop an equivalent kernel interpretation of geostatistical estimators. Given this connection we show how a given covariance function influences the bias and variance of the Kriging estimate as well as the mean squared prediction error.

The {{frictional}} contact behaviour of spline couplings {{is a complex}} topic due to the multiaxial, three-dimensional nature of the shaft and tooth loadings, which typically include torque, axial loads and bending moments, {{as well as local}} tooth interaction, such as tooth sliding and bending.

40|$|Polygonal shafts {{are a major}} {{competitor}} to <b>spline</b> and <b>keyed</b> shafts {{for power}} transmission due to features as self-centering, lack of stress concentration area, and ease of assembly and disassembly. Past studies on polygonal profiles have focused on a single profile and comparisons based on nominal sizes of three and four lobe profiles. This research explores the loading strength of the standardized three and four lobe polygonal shafts and hubs manufactured from the same stock size, subjected to pure torsional and torsional bending load from a spur gear of 20 ° pressure angle at various fits. In absence of analytical solution, Finite element method has been used after verifying the results experimentally, theoretically, and DIN standard. From the finite element analysis, the hub was found to experience greater stress than the shaft in all cases. The clearance fit {{was found to be}} the most critical connection and interference fit to be the most suitable for larger power transmission. The P 4 C connection had greater stress, especially in the hub, than the P 3 G connection. The difference between the P 4 C shaft and the P 3 G shaft was 4. 05 % in the interference fit and 60. 6 % in the clearance fit, suggesting P 4 C clearance fit to be less favorable for larger power transmission. Owing to its small normal axial stress, the P 4 C clearance fit has its use in low power transmission where sliding fit is a requirement. The reason for greater stress in P 4 C shaft and hub connection is due to the large pressure angle at the point of contact, which leads to a smaller contact area and greater contact pressure. The contact pressure was found to be triangular shaped in clearance and transition fit and with a large crest, followed by a trough and a small crest in interference fit for torsional bending load...|$|R

In this study, a Virtual Model Controller (VMC) for supporting one of these subtasks, namely the foot clearance, is presented and evaluated. Methods The developed VMC provides virtual support at the ankle, to increase foot clearance. Therefore, we first developed a new method to derive reference trajectories of the ankle position. These trajectories consist of <b>splines</b> between <b>key</b> events, which are dependent on walking speed and body height. Subsequently, the VMC was evaluated in twelve healthy subjects and six chronic stroke survivors. The impedance levels, of the support, were altered between trials to investigate whether the controller allowed gradual and selective support. Additionally, an adaptive algorithm was tested, that automatically shaped the amount of support to the subjects’ needs. Catch trials were introduced to determine whether the subjects tended to rely on the support. We also assessed the additional value of providing visual feedback. Results With the VMC, the step height could be selectively and gradually influenced. The adaptive algorithm clearly shaped the support level to the specific needs of every stroke survivor. The provided support did not result in reliance on the support for both groups. All healthy subjects and most patients were able to utilize the visual feedback to increase their active participation. Conclusion The presented approach can provide selective control on one of the essential subtasks of walking. This module is the first in a set of modules to control all subtasks. This enables the therapist to focus the support on the subtasks that are impaired, and leave the other subtasks up to the patient, encouraging him to participate more actively in the training. Additionally, the speed-dependent reference patterns provide the therapist with the tools to easily adapt the treadmill speed to the capabilities and progress of the patient. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Consider {{classes of}} signals {{that have a}} finite number of degrees of freedom per unit of time and call this number the rate of {{innovation}}. Examples of signals with a finite rate of innovation include streams of Diracs (e. g., the Poisson process), nonuniform splines, and piecewise polynomials. Even though these signals are not bandlimited, we show that they can be sampled uniformly at (or above) the rate of innovation using an appropriate kernel and then be perfectly reconstructed. Thus, we prove sampling theorems for classes of signals and kernels that generalize the classic “bandlimited and sinc kernel ” case. In particular, we show how to sample and reconstruct periodic and finite-length streams of Diracs, nonuniform splines, and piecewise polynomials using sinc and Gaussian kernels. For infinite-length signals with finite local rate of innovation, we show local sampling and reconstruction based on <b>spline</b> kernels. The <b>key</b> in all constructions is to identify the innovative part of a signal (e. g., time instants and weights of Diracs) using an annihilating or locator filter: a device well known in spectral analysis and error-correction coding. This leads to standard computational procedures for solving the sampling problem, which we show through experimental results. Applications of these new sampling results can be found in signal processing, communications systems, and biological systems.

General purpose equipment includes machines such as pumps that are spared. If they fail or require maintenance the operation does not shut down or slow down. In contrast special purpose equipment (compressor, generator) is critical to the process and if it is unavailable the entire plant might slow down, shut down, or might incur a safety incident or environmental incidence. Generally special purpose equipment and more sophistication is justified {{in the design of the}} interface. The type of interface has also a lot to do with several other issues, including: ?
