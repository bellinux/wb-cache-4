50|$|On 12 March 1955, the {{prototype}} SE 3130 performed its maiden flight. The Alouette II was a widely used type and popular with operators, with over 1,300 rotorcraft eventually being constructed between 1956 and 1975. It was mostly used {{for military purposes}} in observation, photography, air-sea rescue, liaison and training, {{but it has also}} carried anti-tank missiles and homing torpedoes. As a civilian helicopter, the Alouette II was used for casualty evacuation (with two external stretcher panniers), crop-spraying and as a flying crane, with a 500 kg external <b>underslung</b> <b>load.</b>|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} aimed at finding the causes of {{controllability}} variations of a helicopter while transporting sling load. The maximum angular acceleration taken by the helicopter at similar controller displacement at different flight speeds was taken as a quantity characteristic of controllability efficiency to study the load impact on the helicopter cont- rollability. This article offers research results obtained {{with the use of}} the НеliСargо software. This software has proven to be a great tool for integrated research of the impact of an <b>underslung</b> <b>load</b> on the parameters of a helicopter controllability, and allows carrying out an analysis of the impact of an <b>underslung</b> <b>load</b> on the parameters of controllability under its dyna- mic behavior. The performed computational experiments have shown that the helicopter maximum angular acceleration with an <b>underslung</b> <b>load</b> significantly rises, as compared to a helicopter without cargo or a helicopter carrying the same load inside the cargo compartment. The data obtained during computational experiments corresponds to the results of analytical computations, and is in line with the literature based on the experience of helicopter flight operations. The cause of the variation in the helicopter controllability parameters during transportation of an <b>underslung</b> <b>load</b> has been found, that is - the <b>underslung</b> <b>load</b> considerably increases the main rotor thrust, due to sling load, as compared to a helicopter without cargo. When compared to a helicopter carrying a load inside the cargo compartment, this increased efficiency is mainly attributed to the fact that a helicopter with an <b>underslung</b> <b>load</b> has lower rotational inertia, since the load is not inside the cargo compartment, but outside. The obtained results can be used to improve flight manuals and flight personnel training publications, which could play a significant part in ensuring flight safety and security, and increasing the operational efficiency of helicopters with external slung load systems...|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} table {{includes a}} list of helicopter models {{that are designed to}} carry <b>underslung</b> <b>loads.</b> Cargo capacities provided reflect the airframe manufacturer's specifications; when put into practice the actual maximum load capacities may be less, depending on the rating of the cargo hook equipment. For example, if a helicopter model is rated by the manufacturer as having a maximum cargo sling load capacity of 4,000 LB, but the cargo hook equipment is only rated for 3,000 LB, then the pilot can only carry loads weighing 3,000 LB or less.|$|R
50|$|Since the type's inception, the Chinook {{has carried}} out {{secondary}} missions including medical evacuation, disaster relief, search and rescue, aircraft recovery, fire fighting, and heavy construction assistance. According to Suresh Abraham, the Chinook's {{ability to carry}} large, <b>underslung</b> <b>loads</b> has been of significant value in relief operations {{in the aftermath of}} natural disasters. Chinooks operators have often deployed their fleets overseas to support humanitarian efforts in stricken nations; Chinooks of the Republic of Singapore Air Force assisted in relief operations in neighboring Indonesia following the 2004 Asian tsunami, and after the 2005 Kashmir earthquake, the Royal Air Force dispatched Chinooks to Northern Pakistan to assist in recovery efforts.|$|R

40|$|A {{helicopter}} {{carrying an}} <b>underslung</b> <b>load</b> crashed shortly after lifting off. Preliminary investigation indicated that engine malfunction, mechanical problems and structural failures are {{not among the}} causes for the crash. Based on the crash site inspection, the Civil Aviation Department has forwarded an assumed scenario for the helicopter crash as follows : 1. The helicopter lifts off into hover position {{on the crest of}} a ridge with an 962 kg <b>underslung</b> <b>load</b> attached by a 18 meter long chain. 2. As the helicopter transitions from the hover position into forward flight, the <b>underslung</b> <b>load</b> comes into contact with a bush. 3. The <b>underslung</b> <b>load</b> is dragged through the bush. 4. The forward speed of the helicopter {{at the time of the}} accident was about 5 - 10 knots, estimated by the Chief Engineer, and the Check and Training Pilot of the helicopter company. 5. The prevailing wind at the time and place of the accident is estimated at 10 - 15 knots in southeasterly direction. The present study is to define the feasibility of the assumed scenario and to assess the likelihood of the accident happened in such scenario...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the stability {{analysis of a}} helicopter with an underslung external load system. The Lyapunov second method is considered for the stability analysis. The system is considered as a cascade connection of uncertain nonlinear system. The stability analysis is conducted to ensure the stabilisation of the helicopter system and the positioning of the <b>underslung</b> <b>load</b> at hover condition. Stability analysis and numerical results proved that if desired condition for the stability is met, then {{it is possible to}} locate the load at the specified position or its neighbourhood...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} {{a sequel to}} the earlier report titled, Aeroelastic Effects in Multi-Rotor Vehicles with Application to Hybrid Heavy Lift System, Part 1 : Formulation of Equations of Motion (NASA CR- 3822). The trim and {{stability}} equations are presented for a twin rotor system with a buoyant envelope and an <b>underslung</b> <b>load</b> attached to a flexible supporting structure. These equations are specialized for the case of hovering flight. A stability analysis, for such a vehicle with 31 degrees of freedom, yields a total of 62 eigenvalues. A careful parametric study is performed to identify the various blade and vehicle modes, {{as well as the}} coupling between various modes. Finally, it is shown that the coupled rotor/vehicle stability analysis provides information on both the aeroelastic stability as well as complete vehicle dynamic stability. Also presented are the results of an analytical study aimed at predicting the aeromechanical stability of a single rotor helicopter in ground resonance. The theoretical results are found to be in good agreement with the experimental results, thereby validating the analytical model for the dynamics of the coupled rotor/support system...|$|E
50|$|Despite being a light helicopter, the Alouette II {{possesses}} a reasonable lift capacity and can carry <b>underslung</b> <b>loads</b> on an external sling; during one high-profile public demonstration, one helicopter {{was able to}} air-lift a compact Citroen truck weighing in excess of half a ton without visible difficulty. While flying at sea level, the Alouette II uses only 300 of the powerplant's available 400 hp; accordingly, performance can be maintained while operated at a high altitude and withinin tropical conditions where the additional power would come into play. It was capable of flying at altitudes of up to 2,286 meters above sea level while possessing an average climb rate of 250 meters per second and a typical maximum range of 563 miles. Various alternative landing gear configurations could be fitted, including skids, wheels, or pontoons.|$|R
