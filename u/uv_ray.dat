50|$|In {{addition}} to thyroid gland, Vitamin D plays {{crucial role in}} absorption of calcium. In fact, Vitamin D is needed for efficient absorption of calcium and therefore proper bone health. Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, as well, it is unique because it is considered as a hormone; synthesized endogenously in the liver in form of Cholecalciferol. The endogenous inactive form of Vitamin D is Cholecalciferol or Vitamin D3 which is converted to active form of Vitamin D-Calcitriol also known as 1, 25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol in the Kidney upon exposure to <b>UV</b> <b>ray</b> of sun light. Deficiency in Vitamin D or renal disease contributes to bone disorder such as in Osteomalacia in adult and Rickets in children. Osteomalacia is the softening of bones due to poor bone mineralization which is in turn due to poor calcium absorption. Ultimately, these hormonal changes in body; such as function of thyroid, parathyroid, liver and kidney disrupts metabolic changes as well as function of specific organs, which in turn leads to condition that are not desirable such as bone disorders or other endocrine related diseases.|$|E

30|$|Exposure to {{ultraviolet}} (<b>UV)</b> <b>rays</b> influences {{production of}} collagen making the skin darker. <b>UV</b> <b>rays</b> dry and destroy cells and underlying skin structure, giving the skin a furrowed and thickened appearance hastening development of wrinkles especially {{around the eyes}} due to squinting effects [42]. Long exposure to <b>UV</b> <b>rays</b> leads to variations in photoaging like skin wrinkling, elastosis, actinic keratosis, and irregular pigmentation [43]. With long exposure to <b>UV</b> <b>rays,</b> skin texture and color change becoming blotchy, yellowish, leathery, loose, inelastic, and hyper-pigmented. Blood veins close to the skin surface become protrusive forming “spider vein” network in addition to overall speckled skin appearance [44]. Naturally, with lower production of collagen and elastin, the skin becomes leathery and less elastic. Fat cells begin to disappear leading to skin sagging. Fat deposits in some areas like the eye lobe region also affect skin texture. Force of gravity makes the skin leathery and less elastic hence accelerating skin wrinkling.|$|R
