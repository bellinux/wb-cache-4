Still {{completing}} restoration work after massive outages from Fay, BELCO stationed vehicles and supplies at strategic points on the island to prepare for the next hurricane. On the morning of October 16, BELCO switched its focus from Fay to Gonzalo, leaving around 1,500 households without power; the remaining affected customers were asked to refrain from calling to report outages. Ahead of the storm, the Royal Navy frigate HMS Argyll sailed from the Caribbean to provide Bermuda with emergency assistance. Public beaches were closed as hurricane swells began to build, and {{the decision was made to}} shut down the Causeway early on October 17, based on forecasts of long-duration severe winds. Additionally, L.F.Wade International Airport closed prior to the storm's onslaught, accounting for 62canceled commercial flights. Three cruise ships were diverted from the island.|$|E
