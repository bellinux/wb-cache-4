40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Any complex system may potentially exhibit unpredicted and undesirable behaviour {{as a result of}} certain combinations of input stimuli. An Active Network, being a communication network in which user requested operations are undertaken in the netwOIk nodes themselves, is a candidate to exhibit such behaviour. For example, resource utilisation will be influenced by the specific combination of activities triggered by the users and may develop undesirable characteristics such as a self-sustaining profile. Conventional simulation tools do not detect such characteristics. This thesis proposes a solution based on a Petri-Net model in which the resource utilisation of the Active Network is abstracted above the link level communication element. It is then suggested that a certain type of Emergence in resource utilisation may manifest itself as Self-Similarity. The Hurst Parameter (H) of the resource <b>utilisation</b> <b>profile</b> for each node in the network can then be used to identify the presence of this characteristic. The RlS Statistic is used to estimate sets of H values for a range of different Active Application scenarios. It is subsequently seen that a self-sustaining resource <b>utilisation</b> <b>profile</b> (termed a "Cascading Effect") occurs when a significant subset of the nodes display high values of H. This thesis takes the view that Emergence in Active Networks is a problem that has to be approached with a global comprehension of the system as opposed to the conventional approach of a piecemeal development of solutions. This view is reinforced by the hypothesis that an Active Network is a Complex System and Emergence is noncomplex self-organisation within it. It proposes that the high-level abstraction of the Active Network forms a view by which global comprehension can be obtained and is used for the detection of anomalous behaviour (Le. Emergence). The key enabler for self-organisation is proposed to be 'the resources' within the Active Network nodes and hence the detection technique was focused on the utilisation characteristics of these...|$|E

40|$|Since privatisation, {{maintenance}} of DNO LV feeder maximum demand information has gradually demised in some Utility Areas, {{and it is}} postulated that {{lack of knowledge about}} 11 kV and LV electrical networks is resulting in a less economical and energy efficient Network as a whole. In an attempt to quantify the negative impact, this paper examines ten postulated new connection scenarios for a set of real LV load readings, in order to find the difference in design solutions when LV load readings were and were not known. The load profiles of the substations were examined in order to explore the <b>utilisation</b> <b>profile.</b> It was found that in 70 % of the scenarios explored, significant cost differences were found. These cost differences varied by an average of 1000 %, between schemes designed with and without load readings. Obviously, over designing a system and therefore operating more, underutilised transformers becomes less financially beneficial and less energy efficient. The paper concludes that new connection design is improved in terms of cost when carried out based on known LV load information and enhances the case for regular maximum feeder demand information and/or metering of LV feeders...|$|E
40|$|Jasmonic acid (JA) {{signalling}} helps {{plants to}} defend themselves against necrotrophic pathogens and herbivorous insects and {{has been shown to}} influence the root microbiome of Arabidopsis thaliana. In this study, we determined whether JA signalling influences the diversity and functioning of the wheat (Triticum aestivum) microbiome and whether these effects are specific to particular parts of the plant. Activation of the JA pathway was achieved via exogenous application of methyl jasmonate and was confirmed by significant increases in the abundance of 10 JA-signalling-related gene transcripts. Phylogenetic marker gene sequencing revealed that JA signalling reduced the diversity and changed the composition of root endophytic but not shoot endophytic or rhizosphere bacterial communities. The total enzymatic activity and substrate <b>utilisation</b> <b>profiles</b> of rhizosphere bacterial communities were not affected by JA signalling. Our findings indicate that the effects of JA signalling on the wheat microbiome are specific to individual plant compartments...|$|R
40|$|Background The high {{burden of}} {{diabetes}} for healthcare costs {{and their impact}} on quality of life and management of the disease have triggered the design and introduction of disease management programmes (DMPs) in many countries. The extent to which diabetes patients vary with regard to their healthcare utilisation and costs is largely unknown and could impact on the design of DMPs. The objectives of this study are to develop profiles based on both the diabetes-related healthcare utilisation and total healthcare utilisation in primary care, to investigate which patient and disease characteristics determine ‘membership’ of each profile, and to investigate the association between these profiles. Methods Data were used from electronic medical records of 6721 known type II diabetes patients listed in 48 Dutch general practices. Latent Class Analyses were conducted to identify profiles of healthcare and regression analyses were used to analyse the characteristics of the profiles. Results For both diabetes-related healthcare utilisation and total healthcare <b>utilisation</b> three <b>profiles</b> could be distinguished: for the diabetes-related healthcare utilisation these were characterised as ‘high utilisation and frequent home visits’ (n= 393), ‘low utilisation, GP only’ (n= 3231) and ‘high utilisation, GP and nurse’ (n= 3097). Profiles differed with respect to the patients’ age and type of medication; the oldest patients using insulin were dominant in the ‘high utilisation, GP and nurse’ profile. High total healthcare utilisation was not associated with high diabetes-related healthcare utilisation. Conclusions Healthcare utilisation of diabetes patients is heterogeneous. This challenges the development of distinguishable DMPs. Keywords: Type II diabetes mellitus, Healthcare <b>utilisation</b> <b>profiles,</b> Primary care, Latent Class Analyse...|$|R
40|$|Canola (Brassica napus) may be {{incorporated}} into soil as a biofumigant for control of pathogens such as Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Yet, the effect of biofumigants on natural microbial communities required to maintain soil functions is still unclear. A pot experiment with sunflowers as the crop plant was conducted to assess the biofumigation effect of canola on the soil microbial community. The study consisted of 32 pots containing four treatments of eight replicates each. Each pot contained one sunflower plant. The treatments included (1) soil only, (2) soil incorporated with canola, (3) soil incorporated with canola and inoculated with S. sclerotiorum, and (4) soil inoculated with S. sclerotiorum. Microbial community function and structure were assessed through assays of dehydrogenase activity, substrate <b>utilisation</b> <b>profiles</b> and signature biomarker analysis. Chlorophyll a fluorescence measurements were performed {{as a measure of}} sunflower vitality. Canola incorporation brought about transient changes in the soil microbial community, none of which were detrimental. Plant vitality showed no negative effects due to the biofumigant or the inoculated pathogen. Canola can be suitable as a biofumigant, without having harmful effects on the indigenous soil microbial community[URL]...|$|R
40|$|The {{thermophilic}} filamentous fungus, Thermomyces lanuginosus {{produces the}} largest amount of xylanase reported. In addition to this, it expresses {{large amount of}} other enzymes {{that have been used}} industrially or have academic interest. Thus, this fungus has a potential to be applied for biomass conversion to produce biofuel or other applications. In this study, the Biolog system was used to characterize the utilisation and growth of T. lanuginosus on 95 carbon sources. The carbohydrates based compounds, both single sugars and oligosaccharide, showed the best <b>utilisation</b> <b>profile,</b> with the pentose sugar xylose inducing the highest growth, followed by trehelose, raffinose, D-mannose turanose fructose and glucose. Among oligosaccharides, sucrose had the highest mycelium formation followed by stachyose, maltose, maltotriose, glycogen and dextrin. Interestingly the fungus also grew well on cellobiose suggesting that this fungus can produce cellulose hydrolysing proteins. D-alanine was the best amino acid to promote fungal growth while the effect of other amino acids tested was similar to the control. These results demonstrate the ability of this fungus to grow relatively well on most plant based compounds thus making this fungus a possible candidate for plant biomass conversion which can be applied to a number of biotechnological applications including biofuel production. </p...|$|E

Whilst research attention has focused on aetiology and outcomes, the health service utilisation of pregnant women suffering from these complaints has been largely overlooked. Aim: To examine the health status and health service <b>utilisation</b> <b>profile</b> of pregnant women experiencing sciatica, leg cramps or varicose veins. Methods: Linear and logistic regression was applied to a cross-sectional survey of a pregnant women drawn from the 1973 to 1978 cohort (aged 31 - 36 years in 2009), of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health (n = 1835). Participant's demographics, health status and health service utilisation were compared for all three complaints based upon three subgroups (yes, sought help; yes, did not seek help; no). Findings: A number of women experienced sciatica (22. 1 %), leg cramps (18. 2 %) or varicose veins (9. 4 %). Of these, {{a greater proportion of}} women with sciatica (79. 3 %) or varicose veins (71. 5 %) sought help for their condition compared with women with leg cramps (46. 7 %). Comparisons between women with the conditions of interest who did seek help {{and those who did not}} only found that women with a university degree were 0. 29 (95 % CI: 0. 10, 0. 85) times less likely to seek help for their condition compared to women with a school only education. Conclusion: Further research examining all health seeking behaviour and treatment use of pregnant women who experience lower extremity problems is required in order to facilitate safe, effective and coordinated maternity care to further support these women during pregnancy...|$|E
40|$|A {{biofilter}} removes biodegradable contaminants {{from air}} by passing {{it through a}} biologically-active packed bed. The microorganism community is of fundamental interest but {{has been the focus}} of few studies. This work is an investigation of the bacterial community based on the potential functional diversity of the community. A number of experiments were performed in laboratory-scale biofilters using ethanol as a model contaminant. All biofilters were able to remove the ethanol with elimination capacities in the range 80 to 200 gVOCm - 3 h - 1; these values are comparable with published literature. Natural organic media (peat or compost) was used as packing. The potential functional diversity of the community was assessed by Community-Level Physiological Profiling (CLPP) using sole-Carbon Source <b>Utilisation</b> <b>Profile</b> (CSUP). Community samples were used to inoculate Biolog EcoPlates TM : microplates containing a selection of 31 different carbon-substrates and an indicator dye responding to bacterial growth. This technique was found to be sensitive to changes in the community structure over time and location. Results showed that the community in samples taken close together (over a scale of a few centimetres) are similar and that relatively small media samples (0. 5 to 1 g) provide reproducible information. A study of a single biofilter indicated stratification of the community occurring with the community near the inlet diverging from that near the middle and outlet of the unit; this is attributed to the ethanol being degraded in the upper part of the column and the lower part of the column not being subjected to ethanol loading. In a study of two units at a higher loading rate, stratification was not observed over a period of weeks; it is suggested that the stratification may develop over this timescale as a result of the presence or absence of the Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) and not due to differences in concentration. An acclimation period of 7 to 10 days was observed before near-complete removal of ethanol was attained. Monitoring of the community suggested a subsequent shift in diversity. It is suggested that the initial acclimation period is due to biofilm formation and the subsequent shift in community diversity is due to re-organisation of the community as species specialise. In a portion of the biofilter with minimal ethanol exposure, a sudden shift in community is observed after a period of some weeks. This may reflect changes as a result of starvation and indicates that periods of shut-down (when the biofilter is not loaded) may affect the community. Two studies of biofilters operating in parallel were carried out. The first provided evidence of a divergence in the communities over a period of two weeks. In the second, communities in the two units underwent changes over time but observations from both units at any one time were similar. This demonstrates that biofilters set-up and operated in a similar manner may maintain similar communities but that this is not necessarily the case. This has implications for the reproducibility of laboratory experiments and for the variation of community structure with horizontal position in industrial units...|$|E
40|$|Mahony 2 and Alan DW Dobson 1, 2 Background: Styrene is a toxic and {{potentially}} carcinogenic alkenylbenzene used {{extensively in the}} polymer processing industry. Significant quantities of contaminated liquid waste are generated annually as a consequence. However, styrene is not a true xenobiotic and microbial pathways for its aerobic assimilation, via an intermediate, phenylacetic acid, {{have been identified in}} a diverse range of environmental isolates. The potential for microbial bioremediation of styrene waste has received considerable research attention over the last number of years. As a result the structure, organisation and encoded function of the genes responsible for styrene and phenylacetic acid sensing, uptake and catabolism have been elucidated. However, a limited understanding persists in relation to host specific regulatory molecules which may impart additional control over these pathways. In this study the styrene degrader Pseudomonas putida CA- 3 was subjected to random mini-Tn 5 mutagenesis and mutants screened for altered styrene/phenylacetic acid <b>utilisation</b> <b>profiles</b> potentially linked to non-catabolon encoded regulatory influences. Results: One mutant, D 7, capable of growth on styrene, but not on phenylacetic acid, harboured a Tn 5 insertion in the rpoN gene encoding s 54.

40|$|The present thesis {{examined}} the coping strategies employed by adolescents in high-risk drinking situations. Adolescent drinking practices {{are affected by}} influences from four main sources. They are as follows: Culture, Family, Peer and Self. The present paper {{examined the}} different responses of adolescents when faced with influences from these sources. Eighty male adolescents (aged 13 - 17 years) were drawn from two populations, Christian based youth groups and State League Football Clubs. They {{were asked to describe}} the two most recent high-risk drinking situations they had experienced, that is, a situation in which {{they did not want to}} drink alcohol but were most tempted to do so. The subjects were asked to recall their cognitions and behaviours throughout each situation. From the situation descriptions, the physical and social characteristics were examined. Utilisation of different coping strategies were then compared across different social and physical settings. Seventeen coping strategies were identified that were extensively used by male adolescents. An examination of the <b>utilisation</b> <b>profiles</b> for each strategy demonstrated that the employment of different strategies was affected by the social setting, the proportion of friends drinking, and offers of alcohol. Strategies employed in situations involving high levels of stress were aimed at removing the pressures acting upon them (problem-focused coping) ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSoil {{microbial}} communities play {{an important}} role in nutrient cycling and nutrient availability, especially in unimproved soils. In grazed pastures, sheep urine causes local changes in nutrient concentration which may be a source of heterogeneity in microbial community structure. In the present study, we investigated the effects of synthetic urine on soil microbial community structure, using physiological (community level physiological profiling, CLPP), biochemical (phospholipid fatty acid analysis, PLFA) and molecular (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, DGGE) fingerprinting methods. PLFA data suggested that synthetic urine treatment had no significant effect on total microbial (total PLFA), total bacterial or fungal biomass; however, significant changes in microbial community structure were observed with both PLFA and DGGE data. PLFA data suggested that synthetic urine induced a shift towards communities with higher concentrations of branched fatty acids. DGGE banding patterns derived from control and treated soils differed, due to a higher proportion of DNA sequences migrating only to the upper regions of the gel in synthetic urine-treated samples. The shifts in community structure measured by PLFA and DGGE were significantly correlated with one another, suggesting that both datasets reflected the same changes in microbial communities. Synthetic urine treatment preferentially stimulated the use of rhizosphere-C in sole-carbon-source <b>utilisation</b> <b>profiles.</b> The changes caused by synthetic urine addition accounted for only 10 - 15 % of the total variability in community structure, suggesting that overall microbial community structure was reasonably stable and that changes were confined to a small proportion of the communitie...|$|R
40|$|Alternative sigma subunit- 54 (RpoN) forms {{holoenzyme}} complex when {{associated with}} core RNA Polymerase (RNAP) to specifically recognise and initiate transcription of specific sets of genes {{in response to}} environmental stimuli. RpoN has important role in many major adaptive responses in bacteria and is involved in various physiological responses such as pathogenesis, quorum sensing and bioremediation. The main focus {{of this study is}} to gain insight into the role of alternative sigma factor- 54 (RpoN) of Burkholderia xenovorans LB 400 in degradation of dibenzofuran via biphenyl degradation pathway. Additionally, this study also investigated the ability of Burkholderia cenocepacia J 2315 in utilisation of dibenzofuran. The single knockout mutants of rpoN genes were established using pKNOCK suicide vector series resulting two rpoN mutants of Burkholderia xenovorans LB 400; NRPLB [(rpoN 1 mutant) and NRP 2 LB (rpoN 2 mutant) ] and one rpoN mutant of Burkholderia cenocepacia J 2315 [NRPJ (rpoN mutant) ]. The physiological and metabolic responses analyses were conducted to differentiate the single-gene knockout mutants from their wildtype strains; Burkholderia xenovorans LB 400 and Burkholderia cenocepacia J 2315. The physiological response analysis demonstrated that the ability of the mutants NRPLB and NRP 2 LB to form biofilm were not affected with inactivation of rpoN genes. However, the biofilm formation in NRPJ was reduced indicating the involvement of rpoN gene in formation of biofilm in Burkholderia cenocepacia J 2315. Inactivation of rpoN 2 gene does not affect motility of NRP 2 LB (rpoN 2 mutant). However, inactivation of rpoN 1 gene significantly reduced motility of NRPLB (rpoN 1 mutant). Metabolic response analysis shows that rpoN genes play an important role in utilisation of nitrogenous compound even though the effects are depending on the species of the nitrogen. The altered nitrogen <b>utilisation</b> <b>profile</b> when using ammonium, histidine, asparagines, nitrate, glutamine and alanine as sole nitrogen source in single-gene knockout mutants indicate that rpoN genes of Burkholderia xenovorans LB 400 and Burkholderia cenocepacia J 2315 are active and functional for nitrogen utilisation. The ability of Burkholderia xenovorans LB 400 and Burkholderia cenocepacia J 2315 in degrading orthosubstituted PCBs such as dibenzofuran was also determined. Degradation studies of dibenzofuran showed significant differences between wildtype Burkholderia xenovorans LB 400, Burkholderia cenocepacia J 2315 and their single-gene knockout mutants. Degradation rate was found higher in NRP 2 LB (rpoN 2 mutant) compared to wildtype Burkholderia xenovorans LB 400 but reduced significantly in NRPLB (rpoN 1 mutant). This result was supported by gene expression analysis where RpoN-dependent bphA gene that encodes for biphenyl dioxygenase was highly expressed in NRP 2 LB (rpoN 2 mutant) thus enhanced the degradation of dibenzofuran via biphenyl degradation pathway. This result indicates the important role of rpoN 1 gene in Burkholderia xenovorans LB 400 in degradation of dibenzofuran. Simple phytotoxicity assay showed that byproducts from degradation of dibenzofuran by wildtype Burkholderia xenovorans, NRPLB (rpoN 1 mutant) and NRP 2 LB (rpoN 2 mutant) is less toxic towards the test species compared to dibenzofuran. Furthermore, the degradation byproducts from NRP 2 LB (rpoN 2 mutant) was able to enhanced the growth of Sorghum saccharatum compared to control (water) ...|$|E
40|$|Leptosphaeria maculans and L. biglobosa cause {{stem canker}} and dry rot disease on {{brassica}} crops. Although {{the disease has}} been reported to be present in New Zealand brassica cropping areas a comprehensive assessment of the causal agent and epidemiology has not been carried out. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the causal agent(s) and to investigate the epidemiology under New Zealand conditions. Sampling of the disease tissue characteristic to stem canker/dry rot collected from different regions revealed that both Leptosphaeria maculans and L. biglobosa are present. Leptosphaeria maculans was the predominant species accounting for 97 % (n= 127) of the colonies recovered with the remaining 3 % (n= 4) identified as L. biglobosa. Initial species identification based on colony morphology was confirmed using molecular methods (species-specific PCR and sequencing). Leptosphaeria maculans was recovered from both symptomatic oilseed rape (OSR) and swede plants. Determination of the mating type ratio from 39 representative isolates of L. maculans showed that the population deviated from the expected 1 : 1 mating type ratio, being 5 : 1 ratio (MAT 1 - 1 :MAT 1 - 2), with differences between regions. The previously sequenced avirulence alleles Avr 1, Avr 6, and Avr 4 - 7 were present in the L. maculans with Avr 6 being the most common and amplified from all 39 isolates. The most common allele structure was a single Avr 6 (n= 20), followed by multiple avirulence alleles Avr 1, 6 (n= 3), Avr 1, Avr 6, 4 - 7 (n= 12), and Avr 4 - 7, 6 (n= 4). Pathogenicity tests using conidial suspensions of different L. maculans isolates showed that this species is pathogenic on both OSR and swede, with no correlation between pathogenicity and crop origin observed. Leaf lesions which developed on the L. maculans inoculated seedlings were characteristic of the reported symptoms being pale grey lesions with abundant pycnidia. Leptosphaeria maculans progressed systemically from the leaf lesions into the petiole and the adjoining stem to cause stem lesions. Stem lesions were first observed 42 day-post inoculation (dpi) on OSR and swede in the greenhouse experiments. The systemic progression was verified by isolation of the pathogen from the symptomless petiole and stem of inoculated plants, and also from the observation of fungal hyphae in the same tissue under fluorescent microscopy. At 65 dpi, some of the inoculated OSR and swede plants were killed. Swede was more susceptible than OSR, regardless of the tolerance ranking of cultivars. Mating type did not influence disease development in either OSR or swede. Although L. biglobosa was also pathogenic on OSR and swede, developing characteristic leaf lesions, stem/tuber lesions did not develop on inoculated plants after 65 dpi. Stem cankers developed both from systemic infection following leaf inoculation and also from direct conidial inoculation of the stem at the six-leaf stage for both swede and OSR. Symptom expression resulting from direct infection was more severe on swede compared to OSR. Mature leaves of seven month old swede plants were not susceptible to either ascospore or conidial infection and dry rot symptoms did not develop on the bulbs indicating no systemic progression. Direct inoculation of mature swede bulbs with either ascospores or conidia resulted in the development of dry rot symptoms. Symptoms developed four weeks earlier with ascospore inoculation compared with conidia. Spore trapping conducted in 2012 - 2013 using a 7 -day Burkard and Rotorod spore sampler trapped ascospores of L. maculans/L. biglobosa in the field. Ascospores of both species were confirmed by nested-PCR using species-specific primers of the DNA extracted from the melinex tape, and showed that ascospores from both species were released concurrently. In field experiments, the effects of different stubble management practices on disease development in OSR were studied in two years. In 2012, there was no significant difference (P= 0. 844) in the disease incidence between stubble treatments (in direct drill, slashing and disking plots) and was probably due to cross-contamination by ascospores between plots. In 2013, the disease incidence in the direct drill treatment (72. 7 %) was significantly higher than in the ploughing (39. 3 %) and disking treated plots (36. 0 %). Results showed that the development of stem canker in the field resulted from systemic progression, with the timing of leaf lesion development coinciding with the timing of ascospore release. Systemic progression was verified by isolation of L. maculans from the symptomless petiole and stem of the plants which developed leaf lesions. The effect of the combination of burial and treatment of the OSR stubble with 5 % urea on the development of pseudothecia was studied. The results showed that burial stimulated stubble degradation, with urea having no significant effect (P= 0. 234) on stubble weight. The combination of urea and burial reduced pseudothecial development with no fruiting bodies recovered from the stubble after 17 weeks. Both bacterial and fungal diversity assessed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) differed across assessment times. The burial treatment affected the carbon <b>utilisation</b> <b>profile,</b> analysed using the MicroRespTM system, of the soil microbial community associated with the stubble at the April (8 weeks) assessment, but urea application had not effect. Overall findings from this study showed that both ascospores and conidia of L. maculans were able to cause stem canker/dry rot disease. The disease was initiated by ascospores in the field with the high risk period of ascospore release between May-August. The disease can be reduced by targeting and eliminating the overwintering inoculum and hence primary spore production. From this study, a combination of 5 % urea application and burial of the stubble after harvest was indicated as a method to reduce inoculum carry over...|$|E

Approximately half (52 %) of the isolates could grow at both 27 and 37 °C while another half (48 %) failed {{to grow at}} 37 °C. All isolates could be amplified with primers specific to the pectate lyase (pel) gene. Carbon <b>utilisation</b> <b>profiles</b> could not conclusively identify these isolates. PCR amplification using primers specific for Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. brasiliensis was positive for all isolates that grew at 37 °C. However, the group that did not grow at 37 °C failed to amplify with P. atrosepticum specific primers. To characterise this group of isolates, the intergenic transcribed spacer region (ITS) was amplified and PCR products digested with two restriction enzymes (RsaI and CfoI) to generate ITS-PCRRFLP profiles.

Profiles of five of the selected atypical strains generated with the enzyme CfoI appeared to be most similar to those of P. wasabiae type strain.

When introduced to the rhizosphere of two potato (Solanum tuberosum) cultivars (cv. Swift and cv. Nevsky), various ACC deaminase containing rhizobacteria (Achromobacter xylosoxidans Cm 4, Pseudomonas oryzihabitans Ep 4 and Variovorax paradoxus 5 C- 2) not only decreased rhizosphere ACC concentrations but also decreased concentrations of several proteinogenic amino acids (glutamic acid, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine, valine). These effects were not always correlated with the ability of the bacteria to metabolise these compounds in vitro, suggesting bacterial mediation of root amino acid exudation. All rhizobacteria showed similar root colonisation following inoculation of sand cultures, thus species differences in amino acid <b>utilisation</b> <b>profiles</b> apparently did not confer any selective advantage in the potato rhizosphere. Rhizobacterial inoculation increased root biomass (by up to 50 %) and tuber yield (by up to 40 %) in pot trials, and tuber yield (by up to 27 %) in field experiments, especially when plants were grown under water-limited conditions. Nevertheless, inoculated and control plants showed similar leaf water relations, indicating that alternative mechanisms (regulation of phytohormone balance) were responsible for growth promotion. Rhizobacteria generally increased tuber number more than individual tuber weight, suggesting that accelerated vegetative development was responsible for increased yield...|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} use of precast components in building and heavy civil engineering projects {{has led to the}} introduction of innovative management and scheduling systems to meet the demand for increased reliability, efficiency and cost reduction. The aim {{of this study is to}} develop an innovative crew allocation system that can efficiently allocate crews of workers to labour-intensive repetitive processes. The objective is to improve off-site precast production operations using multi-layered genetic algorithms (GAs). The multi-layered concept emerged in response to the requirement of modelling different sets of labour inputs. As part of the techniques used in developing a crew allocation ‘SIM_Crew’ system, a process mapping methodology is used to model processes of precast concrete operations and to provide the framework and input required for simulation. Process simulation is then used to model and imitate all production processes and GAs are embedded within the simulation model to provide a rapid and intelligent search. A multi-layered chromosome is used to store different sets of inputs such as crews working on different shifts and process priorities. The results illustrate that adopting different combinations of crews of workers has a substantial impact on the labour allocation cost and this should lead to increased efficiency and lower production cost. In addition, the results of the simulation show that reduced throughput and process-waiting times and improved resource <b>utilisation</b> <b>profiles</b> can be achieved when compared with a real-life case study...|$|R

Soils from 17 plots (Maures mountains range, Var, France) were classified into 5 wildfire regimes (i. e. not burned since at least 57 years ago, infrequently and frequently burned-with time since fire between 4 and 17 years). Soil samples from these plots were analysed for their nutrient content, chemical functions of soil organic matter (SOM) using FT-MIR spectroscopy and microbial mineralising activities. Our results showed that the frequent wildfire regime slowed down the recovery in the short term of SOM spectroscopic properties and nutrient availability. Both low quantity and low quality (i. e. high percentage of aromatic and phenolic organic forms) of soil organic matter were found to be related to soil microbial recovery at 4 years after frequent wildfires.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{examined}} the metabolic activity of pure cultures of five root pathogens commonly found in closed hydroponic cultivation systems (Phytophthora cryptogea (PC), Phytophthora capsici (PCP), Pythium aphanidermatum (PA), Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici (FORL) and Fusarium solani (FS)) using sole carbon source utilisa-tion {{in order to develop}} effective biocontrol strategies against these pathogens. Aliquots of 150 μL of the mycelial sus-pension were inoculated in each well of GN 2 microtitre plates. On the basis of average well colour development and number of positive wells, the pathogens were divided into two groups, (i) PA and FORL and (ii) PC, PCP and FS. Group (i) was characterised by a short lag-phase, a rapid exponential phase involving almost all carbon sources offered and a long stationary phase, while group (ii) had a more extended lag-phase and a slower utilisation rate of the carbon sources offered. The three isolates in group (ii) differed significantly during their exponential phase. The lowest utilisation rate of carbon sources and number of sources utilised was found for PCP. Of the major group of carbon sources, six carbohy-drates, three carboxylic acids and four amino acids were rapidly used by all isolates tested at an early stage. The carbon sources gentibiose, -D-glucose, maltose, sucrose, D-trehalose, L-aspartic acid, L-glutamic acid, L-proline persisted {{to the end of the}} exponential phase. Moreover, similarities between the metabolic profiles of the tested pathogen and the those of the resident microflora could also be found. These findings are of great importance as regards the role of the resi-dent microflora in the biocontrol.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{aim of this}} research was to determine the influence of an increasing wildfire history on the recovery at short and long term of soil organic matter (SOM) composition and microbial properties. The contemporary wildfire events (since 1950) were recorded for 27 plots located on the siliceous part of the French Mediterranean region (Maures mountain ranges). A wildfire history index was built, tested and calculated in order to display numerical values representative of the different wildfire history parameters (i. e. number of fires, time since fire and mean fire interval). Microbial basal respiration and biomass were analysed as well as intensity of the use of 31 C-substrates, catabolic diversity and C-substrates <b>utilisation</b> <b>profiles.</b> Furthermore, a qualitative characterisation of the SOM was carried out by solid state 13 C NMR. Potential drivers of the microbial recovery were identified by studying the relationships between microbial activities and chemical functions of SOM. Our results showed that fire histories resulting in considerable losses or alterations of SOM, such as recent or close fires, decreased the microbial catabolic evenness. This could be attributed to a preferential utilisation of N-containing compounds and complex substrates such as aromatic and polymers reflecting a greater N microbial demand and a selection of specific catabolic functions. Moreover, a large number of fires (4 fires in 57 years compared to 1 - 2) resulted in lasting degradation of the relative intensity of methyl C function in polymethylene, O-Alkyl C, aromatic C and phenolic C functions inducing a slow-down in recovery of microbial properties. These results also confirm our hypothesis that some chemical functions of SOM can be in equilibrium with wildfire history. Finally, this research demonstrates that FT-NIR analysis {{can be used as a}} valuable tool to assess both the wildfire history and the vulnerability of soil quality to shifts in historical fire regimes...|$|R

The objectives were to compare several identification systems for E. coli and to develop and test a polyphasic taxonomic approach using the four methodologies combined for the sub-typing of O 157 and non-O 157 E. coli. The nucleotide sequences of the 16 S– 23 S rRNA ITS regions were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), sequenced and compared with reference data available at the GenBank database using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). Additional information comprising the utilisation of carbon sources, riboprint profiles and FT-IR spectra was also collected. The capacity of the methods for the identification and typing of E. coli to species and subspecies levels was evaluated. Data were transformed and integrated to present polyphasic hierarchical clusters and relationships. The study reports {{the use of an}} integrated scheme comprising phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and genotypic information (carbon source profile, sequencing of the 16 S– 23 S rRNA ITS, ribotyping and FT-IR spectroscopy) for a more precise characterisation and identification of E. coli. The results showed that identification of E. coli strains by each individual method was limited mainly by the extension and quality of reference databases. On the contrary, the polyphasic approach, whereby heterogeneous taxonomic data were combined and weighted, improved the identification results, gave more consistency to the final clustering and provided additional information on the taxonomic structure and phenotypic behaviour of strains, as shown by the close clustering of strains with similar stress resistance patterns. peer-reviewedThe authors acknowledge the financial contribution of the Spanish INIA, the Research Council of Norway (project 178230 /I 10), Foundation for Levy on Foods, the Norwegian Research Fees Fund for Agricultural Goods, the Norwegian Independent Meat and Poultry Association, Nortura SA and NHO Matog Landbruk...|$|R
40|$|Extended {{spectrum}} β-lactamases (ESBLs) are enzymes {{produced by}} bacteria that confer resistance to cephalosporins, antibiotics that {{are widely used}} to treat infections in animals and humans. The emergence of plasmid-borne ESBL resistance in humans and animals, especially poultry, is of particular concern. Avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC) cause colibacillosis, an economically important disease of poultry, but have also been linked to human disease. Of growing concern is the potential transfer of ESBL-producing plasmids between E. coli isolates {{and their impact on}} the host bacterium. Thus, the aim {{of this study was to}} characterise ESBL plasmids in APEC isolated from UK poultry and examine their impact on host bacterial fitness and virulence. Plasmid profiling and genome sequencing revealed that all three APEC isolates harboured at least two plasmids, belonging to the IncF and IncI replicon types. The ESBL plasmid was identical in each isolate, being of 105, 610 Kb in size, belonging to the IncI 1 -Iy family and carrying the blaCTX-M- 1 allele. Upstream of blaCTX-M- 1 gene was an ISEcp 1 insertion element, which likely contributes to the transmissibility of the element. The plasmid also carried genes coding for tetracycline resistance that were co-transferred with the β-lactamase genes. The APEC isolates also harboured a large virulence plasmid of similar size, but belonging to the IncF replicon type. Competitive growth studies in rich or minimal media found no significant differences in the growth of CTX-M- 1 plasmid-harbouring and plasmid-cured derivatives. However, the presence of the CTX-M- 1 plasmid in APEC O 78 was beneficial to their growth in iron-limited media, but caused a greater fitness burden at low pH. When present as the only plasmid in APEC, the ESBL-containing derivatives produced more biofilm at human and chicken body temperatures and were better able to invade and survive in human (THP- 1) and chicken (HD 11) macrophage cell lines than the cured isolates. Finally, the substrate <b>utilisation</b> <b>profiles</b> of the plasmid-containing derivatives differed to that of the parent strains, indicating that the plasmid may influence the metabolic capability of the organism. The studies presented here indicate that ESBL plasmids of the IncI 1 - 1 Y type spread readily to unrelated APEC isolates and can influence the fitness of APEC under certain conditions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Styrene is a toxic and {{potentially}} carcinogenic alkenylbenzene used {{extensively in the}} polymer processing industry. Significant quantities of contaminated liquid waste are generated annually as a consequence. However, styrene is not a true xenobiotic and microbial pathways for its aerobic assimilation, via an intermediate, phenylacetic acid, {{have been identified in}} a diverse range of environmental isolates. The potential for microbial bioremediation of styrene waste has received considerable research attention over the last number of years. As a result the structure, organisation and encoded function of the genes responsible for styrene and phenylacetic acid sensing, uptake and catabolism have been elucidated. However, a limited understanding persists in relation to host specific regulatory molecules which may impart additional control over these pathways. In this study the styrene degrader Pseudomonas putida CA- 3 was subjected to random mini-Tn 5 mutagenesis and mutants screened for altered styrene/phenylacetic acid <b>utilisation</b> <b>profiles</b> potentially linked to non-catabolon encoded regulatory influences. Results One mutant, D 7, capable of growth on styrene, but not on phenylacetic acid, harboured a Tn 5 insertion in the rpoN gene encoding &# 963; 54. Complementation of the D 7 mutant with the wild type rpoN gene restored the ability of this strain to utilise phenylacetic acid as a sole carbon source. Subsequent RT-PCR analyses revealed that a phenylacetate permease, PaaL, was expressed in wild type P. putida CA- 3 cells utilising styrene or phenylacetic acid, but could not be detected in the disrupted D 7 mutant. Expression of plasmid borne paaL in mutant D 7 was found to fully restore the phenylacetic acid utilisation capacity of the strain to wild type levels. Bioinformatic analysis of the paaL promoter from P. putida CA- 3 revealed two &# 963; 54 consensus binding sites in a non-archetypal configuration, with the transcriptional start site being resolved by primer extension analysis. Comparative analyses of genomes encoding phenylacetyl CoA, (PACoA), catabolic operons identified a common association among styrene degradation linked PACoA catabolons in Pseudomonas species studied to date. Conclusions In summary, this is the first study to report RpoN dependent transcriptional activation of the PACoA catabolon paaL gene, encoding a transport protein essential for phenylacetic acid utilisation in P. putida CA- 3. Bioinformatic analysis is provided to suggest this regulatory link may be common among styrene degrading Pseudomonads...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MSc (Environmental Sciences)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. Sunflower {{cultivation}} in South Africa {{is threatened}} {{to a large}} extent by the fungal parasite, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, which causes extensive head rot and crop losses of up to 100 %. This is a major problem for commercial farmers since it leads to a lower farm income, as the use of fungicides minimises crop damage, but increases production costs and can lead to several environmental problems. Therefore, an alternative is needed which can still control crop diseases, without harbouring health and environmental risks. Due to their biofumigation potential, Brassica plant species incorporated into the soil as green manures can be applied as alternatives for chemical pesticides. These plants produce glucosinolates that are hydrolysed upon tissue disruption by the enzyme, myrosinase, into active products for example isothiocyanates. Since isothiocyanates are highly toxic, it can be used instead of conventional pesticides for the inhibition of soil–borne pathogens. However, {{little is known about the}} effect of such biofumigants on the natural soil microbial communities required to maintain soil functions. A greenhouse experiment was conducted to assess the influence of canola (Brassica napus) green manure on soil microbial community function and structure. The study consisted of 32 pots containing four treatments of eight replicates each. The treatments included 1) only sunflowers in soil (control), 2) sunflowers in soil incorporated with canola green manure; 3) sunflowers in soil incorporated with canola and inoculated with S. sclerotiorum and 4) sunflowers in soil inoculated with S. sclerotiorum. The experiment was conducted for 120 days. From the soil physico–chemical properties conducted before the treatments were applied and after experiment completion, it was evident that the initial stimulating effect of canola manure on the soil carbon, total nitrogen and organic carbon content was not longlasting. The overall microbial activity assessed with dehydrogenase assays and Biolog® Ecoplates, varied in relation to plant growth cycles, as root secretions differed. Multivariate analysis of the substrate utilisation patterns, distinguished among the treatments. <b>Utilisation</b> <b>profiles</b> illustrated that although different members of microorganisms were active in the various treatments, similar trends could still be observed. All four treatments showed similar diversity profiles after 120 days. Phospholipid fatty acid results indicated a significant increase in microbial biomass for all four treatments over time. The microbial community Summary vii structure differed to a lesser extent between treatments, but changed over time within each treatment. Community function varied according to the changing structure. Fatty acid stress ratios for all treatments showed significantly lower stress levels just after manure amendments, as the added organic matter might have stimulated microbial growth. Chlorophyll a fluorescence measurements showed shifts occurring in the photosynthetic efficiency of the sunflowers among the treatments. S. sclerotiorum had a suppressive effect on photosystem II functionality leading to lower electron transport and ATP production. Canola green manure amendments had a slight negative effect on sunflower vitality. Overall the results obtained from this study suggest that incorporation of canola green manure into the soil has an effect on soil microbial community function and structure. Nonetheless, this biofumigation effect is short–lived and microbial communities returned to their initial compositions after the disturbance. The methods applied during this investigation indicated a possible suppressive effect of the canola manure on S. sclerotiorum. Master...|$|R

Canyoners were most likely to visit canyons as part of a club activity, or with friends and family. Few used organised tours, and canyoning was seldom a solo activity. Most perceived that there was moderate damage due to canyoning. Few considered that management should intervene at current levels of impact.

40|$|Currently, a large {{proportion}} of novel microbial evolutionary lineages is poorly understood due to limited coverage of representative species. These “candidate” lineages represent significant gaps in our understanding of microbial function and ecology. This study focused on Chthonomonas calidirosea, the earliest isolated species within Armatimonadetes, the most recently-recognised bacterial phylum. The overall aim of this research was to start to understand the ecology and phylogeny of Armatimonadetes, and provide a foundation for future research into the phylum, with the benefit of narrowing the current knowledge gaps on microbial diversity. This was achieved by integrating multiple data types (phylogenetics, genomics, and community profiling metagenomics). The initial stage of this research aimed to address and clarify conflicts in reported phylogeny of the phylum Armatimonadetes. This study generated a comprehensive reference phylogenetic tree of 16 S rRNA genes for the phylum, so that the phylogenetic position of newly-identified phylotypes can be reliably associated across studies. Multiple robust statistical methods were used to arrive at a consensus on the partitioning of classes and neighbouring phyla. The process also helped to identify and exclude candidate phyla previously misattributed to Armatimonadetes, thus better defining the phylum for future studies. The deeply-branching phylogenetic relationship of Armatimonadetes with other bacterial phyla was resolved by the sequencing of C. calidirosea T 49 T genome and analysing concatenated amino acid sequences of conserved genes against homologs in other prokaryotic genomes. The phylogenomic analysis showed Chloroflexi to be the most closely related formal phylum to Armatimonadetes. This publication was the first analysis of a genome from the phylum Armatimonadetes, and provided evolutionarily- and genetically-distinct insights to the overall knowledge of microbial genetic diversity. Analysis of the genome showed a metabolism geared towards non-cellulosic carbohydrates as the carbon and energy source, which coincides with previous culture-based physiological experiments (Lee et al., 2011). Genetic mechanisms behind leucine auxotrophy and narrow pH growth range were also identified. These observations supported the theory that C. calidirosea T 49 T occupies the niche of a scavenger of diverse species of carbohydrates within geothermal environments, in association with cellulolytic community members. In addition, the genome exhibited an unusual disorganisation of functionally-related genes typically found in conserved operons. The relatively high abundance of sigma factors (relative to genome size) in strain T 49 T may {{play an important role in}} gene regulation and coordination of metabolic pathways to compensate for the scattering of operons. Overall, this research built upon the previous physiological characterisation C. calidirosea T 49 T (Lee et al., 2011), resulting in a more in-depth and integrated analysis of the bacterium through both phenotypic and genotypic information. Finally, to investigate the genome dynamics of the species (particularly in genome organisation and adaptation to various environments as a scavenger), and to provide ecological and evolutionary context beyond the single genome analysed, the genomes of three additional C. calidirosea isolates cultured from diverse locations across the Taupō Volcanic Zone were extracted, sequenced, and compared to T 49 T. The genomes exhibited higher within-species conservation than other thermophilic species such as Thermus thermophilus (Henne et al., 2004; Jiang et al., 2013; Oshima & Ariga, 1975) and Sulfolobus islandicus (Reno et al., 2009) isolated from similar geographical distance. No genomic rearrangements were identified between C. calidirosea isolates. The majority of variation was limited to single nucleotide polymorphisms, with a limited number of horizontally-transferred genes and differentially-present fast-evolving genes, such as restriction modification system. The phylogeny and carbohydrate <b>utilisation</b> <b>profiles</b> of the isolates correlated with the geographical relationship between the sample sites rather than with other factors, such as soil geochemistry or microbial communities of the sites. The correlation between geography and phylogeny, low abundance of C. calidirosea at all sample sites (ranging from 0. 006 % to 0. 3 %), and the high genomic conservation indicated rapid aeolian dispersal and localised extinction as the most probable causes of homogeneity between the populations. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the genome dynamics and ecology of C. calidirosea, as well as the dispersal possibilities of free-living bacteria between distinct and discrete habitats. These studies addressed the overarching aim to investigate the ecology and phylogeny of Armatimonadetes through the research outlined above. This body of work contributed greatly to our understanding of Armatimonadetes phylogeny, both by clarifying its internal taxonomy and its position relative to neighbouring clades. Furthermore, it contributed to understanding of Armatimonadetes ecology by richly describing the ecological niche, genome, and lifestyle of C. calidirosea. Not only does this work greatly increase our understanding of the newest of the 30 prokaryotic phyla (Euzéby, 2011, Retrieved in December 2014), it also provides a rich foundation for future study...|$|R
40|$|Bacteria {{are one of}} {{the three}} taxonomic domains and {{play a major role in}} the {{biological}} processes on Earth, yet their taxonomy and constituent species are poorly understood. OP 10 is a candidate division within the domain Bacteria that up until recently has no cultivated representative. Until the recent isolation of the cultivated OP 10 strains T 49 and P 488 from the Taupo Volcanic Zone in New Zealand (Stott et al. 2008), little was known about this putative phylum despite the fact that its presence was detected in various environmental surveys. This study aims to (i) characterise the physiology of one of the first isolated OP 10 species, strain T 49; and (ii) investigate and expand upon known OP 10 diversity by using targeted oligonucleotide primers. Optimal growth temperature and pH of T 49 was determined by cultivation in liquid medium. T 49 substrate utilisation was investigated by culturing T 49 with various substrates, with a focus on its sugar <b>utilisation</b> <b>profiles.</b> T 49 was also characterised for its cell morphology through transmission and scanning electron microscopy as well as phase contrast microscopy. The total fatty acid profile of T 49 was characterised through gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy. OP 10 diversity was investigated at several geothermal sites using OP 10 -specific primers designed in the course of this study. The primers target conserved regions of the 16 S rRNA gene sequence specific to clades within OP 10. The primers were designed in silico by obtaining publically available OP 10 16 S rRNA gene sequences (through the Greengenes and SILVA databases) as references and dividing the candidate division into distinct clades through phylogenetic analysis with ARB. Primers were selected for specificity and coverage of the reference sequences within each of the clades. The performance of the primers were investigated by applying the primers against environmental DNA samples where OP 10 sequences were previously identified, as well as various negative controls. The results were validated by sequencing PCR products generated to identify positive OP 10 hits and false positive non-OP 10 hits. This study found that T 49 had a rod-shape morphology with the dimensions of 0. 5 - 0. 7 m by 2. 5 - 3. 0 m, more than half (67. 4 %) of the total fatty acids of the bacteria consisted of stearic acid (18 : 0) and palmitic acid (16 : 0), and GC content of 54. 6 %. Furthermore, T 49 was found to have a growth temperature range of less than 50 degrees C to 73 degrees C and optimum at 68 degrees C, growth pH range of 4. 9 to 5. 8 and optimum at pH 5. 3. Substrate utilisation experiments showed that strain T 49 grew optimally using mono- and di- saccharides such as arabinose, mannose, ribose, galactose, and maltose, as well as amorphous polysaccharides including starch, glycogen, and dextrin. The OP 10 -specific primers successfully identified the presence of OP 10 in environmental samples from Waikite, Waipahihi, and Mount Ngauruhoe, confirming previous unpublished 16 S rRNA gene sequence surveys. Furthermore, the OP 10 -specific primers also identified previously undetected genetic diversity in Tikitere and Mount Ngauruhoe, demonstrating the advantage of the primers over traditional universal primers with their high specificity for OP 10 DNA sequences which enabled more sensitive surveys of OP 10 in the environment. The characterisation of the first OP 10 species and the development of OP 10 -specific primers enable further investigation into this major taxonomic group within the Bacteria domain. T 49 and its related strains may play important role within their environments, which can now be investigated based on these known physiologies. The effectiveness of the OP 10 -specific primers experimented may be use to detect presence of OP 10 species in the environment at a higher sensitivity and selectiveness than traditional primers. The results from this research have expanded our knowledge on this previously unknown phylum. By increasing our knowledge of the OP 10 candidate division, we also increase our understanding of the global bacterial diversity and this may help bring about insights into biology and global climate processes as well generating practical solutions in these fields. Many of these initial observations of T 49 merit further investigation. These include: The production of pigments and lipids, two distinct cytosolic structures, and interesting growth behaviours such as quorum sensing and biofilm formation. OP 10 -specific primers developed in this study can be improved upon through further validations with environmental DNA representing clades that were not tested during this study due to unavailability. The improved primers can be developed as a rapid diagnostic tool to detect OP 10 in the environment for isolation efforts. The primers may also act as fluorescent probes to identify OP 10 in microbial consortia such as biofilms while preserving the structure of the microenvironments...|$|R

Data collected enabled the determination of an optimum operating cycle for the effective treatment of a synthetic wastewater containing up to 1300 mg/l phenol as the sole carbon source. Oxygen uptake rates were monitored in situ at various stages of a bench-scale sequencing batch reactor. Respirometry was used as an indicator of microbial activity and substrate <b>utilisation.</b> Although the <b>profile</b> of the Oxygen Uptake Rate (OUR) followed closely that of phenol substrate removal, any correlation between the OUR and soluble residual substrate COD was specific to that system. A high OUR Value corresponded to the feed period; {{at the end of the}} cycle, when the substrate was depleted, the OUR Value was low. A plot of OUR values provided a good indication of the biological activity in the reactior. It was possible to select an optimum operating cycle using the oxygen uptake rates as an indicator for the removal of phenol. The initial operating cycle was 24 h, which included phases for filling, reaction, quiescence and decanting. From oxygen uptake rates and corresponding soluble COD values of the remaining substrate, data showed that the 4 h operating cycle was able to achieve similar substrate removal efficiencies. At a SBR loading rate of 3. 12 kg phenol m(- 3) d(- 1), removal of 97 % COD was achieved at the end of the cycle. The reactor was operated at a SRT of 4 - 27 days with biomass concentrations ranging from 3500 - 3900 mg/l. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
