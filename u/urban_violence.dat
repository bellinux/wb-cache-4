5|$|New Amerykah Part One is an esoteric concept album titled as a pun on Badu's {{first name}} and a {{reflection}} of the record's political leanings. It features social commentary and themes related to the plight of the African-American community, including poverty, <b>urban</b> <b>violence,</b> complacency, and cultural identity. The record's densely produced music incorporates funk, R, hip hop, soul, jazz, and electronica styles.|$|E
25|$|Rather than {{endorsing}} Batista's hand-picked successor Carlos Zayas, the Cuban people elected Ramón Grau San Martín in 1944. A populist physician, who had briefly {{held the}} presidency in the 1933 revolutionary process, Grau {{made a deal with}} labor unions to continue Batista's pro-labor policies. Grau's administration coincided with the end of World War II, and he presided over an economic boom as sugar production expanded and prices rose. He instituted programs of public works and school construction, increasing social security benefits and encouraging economic development and agricultural production. However, increased prosperity brought increased corruption, with nepotism and favoritism flourishing in the political establishment, and <b>urban</b> <b>violence,</b> a legacy of the early 1930s, reappearing on a large scale. The country was also steadily gaining a reputation as a base for organized crime, with the Havana Conference of 1946 seeing leading Mafia mobsters descend upon the city.|$|E
500|$|The Joker {{serves as}} an {{unreliable}} narrator. He admits to his own uncertainty, as he has disparate memories of the single event ("Sometimes I remember it one way, sometimes another...

5000|$|However, not all <b>urban</b> {{political}} <b>violence</b> can {{be labeled}} as urban guerrilla. The Black Panther Party might not qualify, due to its public nature, although its policy of [...] "self-defense" [...] was interchangeable with a policy of armed struggle in militarily occupied African American communities. Similarly the Italian Autonomia movement, and the German Autonomen engaged in <b>urban</b> political <b>violence,</b> but not as urban guerrillas due to their policies of public, mass and non-deadly violence.|$|R

500|$|In 1983 Tippett became {{president}} of the London College of Music and was appointed a Member of the Order of Merit (OM). [...] By the time of his 80th birthday in 1985 he was blind in his right eye, and his output had slowed. Nevertheless, in his final active years he wrote his last opera, New Year. This futuristic fable involving flying saucers, time travel and <b>urban</b> <b>violence</b> was indifferently received on its première in Houston, Texas, on 17 October 1989. Donal Henahan in The New York Times wrote that [...] "Unlike Wagner, Tippett does not provide music of enough quality to allow one to overlook textual absurdities and commonplaces."

500|$|Lyrically, New Amerykah Part One is an esoteric concept {{album with}} sociopolitical themes and mostly downbeat subject matter. It {{features}} more impersonal topics and social commentary than on Badu's previous work. Its subject matter deals with social concerns and struggles within the African-American community, exploring {{topics such as}} institutional racism, religion, poverty, <b>urban</b> <b>violence,</b> the abuse of power, complacency, drug addiction, and nihilism. Badu said she wrote about [...] "poor families, the undermining of the working class, the so-called minority." [...] According to New York critic Nitsuh Abebe, the record's main theme was the struggle for African Americans to determine their cultural identity {{in light of the}} [...] "Civil Rights and post-Civil Rights" [...] era. In Ratliff's opinion, the album's subject matter has been explored before by Mayfield, Marvin Gaye, and Funkadelic, which [...] "suggests that little has changed in nearly 40 years, and perhaps ... that's her point." [...] Quentin B. Huff from PopMatters believed that like Suzanne Vega's 2007 album Beauty & Crime, New Amerykah Part One also incorporated [...] "a post-9/11 worldview, plus a few shots of community spirit, individual growth, pleas for social activism and spiritual enlightenment, and ... the realities of death." [...] He felt that like the [...] "clash in musical styles", some songs [...] "seem committed to having America honor" [...] the promise of the American Dream for African-Americans, while other songs [...] "seem to reject the promise, or at least the idea that the promise can be fulfilled without considerable effort".|$|E

2500|$|A {{report issued}} by the LAPD after the SLA shootout offers {{one of the few}} firsthand {{accounts}} by the department regarding SWAT history, operations, and organization. On page 100 of the report, the Department cites four trends which prompted the development of SWAT. These included riots such as the Watts Riots, which in the 1960s forced the LAPD and other police departments into tactical situations for which they were ill-prepared; the emergence of snipers as a challenge to civil order; political assassinations; and the threat of urban guerrilla warfare by militant groups. [...] "The unpredictability of the sniper and his anticipation of normal police response increase the chances of death or injury to officers. To commit conventionally trained officers to a confrontation with a guerrilla-trained militant group would likely result in a high number of casualties among the officers and the escape of the guerrillas." [...] To deal with these under conditions of <b>urban</b> <b>violence,</b> the LAPD formed SWAT, notes the report. The report states on page 109, [...] "The purpose of SWAT is to provide protection, support, security, firepower, and rescue to police operations in high personal risk situations where specialized tactics are necessary to minimize casualties." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2014, {{a series}} of protests, {{political}} demonstrations, and civil insurrection began in Venezuela due to the country's high levels of <b>urban</b> <b>violence,</b> inflation, and chronic shortages of basic goods attributed to economic policies such as strict price controls. While protests occurred in January 2014, after the murder of actress and former Miss Venezuela Mónica Spear, mass protesting began in earnest that February following the attempted rape of a student on a university campus in San Cristóbal. [...] Subsequent arrests and killings of student protestors spurred their expansion to neighboring cities and the involvement of opposition leaders. [...] The year's early months were characterized by large demonstrations and violent clashes between protestors and government forces that resulted in nearly 4,000 arrests and 43 deaths, including both supporters and opponents of the government. Toward the end of 2014, and into 2015, continued shortages and low oil prices caused renewed protesting. By 2016, protests occurred following the controversy surrounding the 2015 Venezuelan parliamentary elections {{as well as the}} incidents surrounding the 2016 recall referendum. On 1 September 2016, the largest demonstration of the protests occurred, with over 1 million Venezuelans, or over 3% of the entire nation's population, gathered to demand a recall election against President Maduro, with the event being described as the [...] "largest demonstration in the history of Venezuela". Following the suspension of the recall referendum by the government-leaning National Electoral Council (CNE) on 21 October 2016, the opposition organized another protest which was held on 26 October 2016, with over 1.2 million Venezuelans participating. After some of the largest protests occurred in a late-2016, Vatican-mediate dialogue between the opposition and government was attempted and ultimately failed in January 2017. Concentration on protests subsided in the first months of 2017 until the 2017 Venezuelan constitutional crisis occurred when the pro-government Supreme Tribunal of Justice of Venezuela attempted to assume the opposition-led National Assembly and removed their immunity, though the move was reversed days later, demonstrations grew [...] "into the most combative since a wave of unrest in 2014". The protests are considered to be the Mother of all Protests.|$|E
