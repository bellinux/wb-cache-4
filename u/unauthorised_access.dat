Administration of the camp at Płaszów {{was turned over to}} SS-Obersturmführer Arnold Büscher. Göth was scheduled for an appearance before SS judge Georg Konrad Morgen, but due to the progress of World War II and Germany's looming defeat, the charges against him were dropped in early 1945. SS doctors diagnosed Göth as suffering from mental illness, and he was committed to a mental institution in Bad Tölz, where he was arrested by the United States military in May 1945.|$|E
25|$|On 9 September 2007, Australian and Turkish naval {{authorities}} {{began an}} undersea investigation {{to determine if}} AE2 could be raised and restored. Such a plan would see the submarine transferred to a viewing tank at Çanakkale. As part of the inspection, a drop camera was inserted through the submarine's open hatch and into the control room. The survey team discovered that the wreck of AE2 had suffered further damage since the 1998 inspection dives. The bow portion of the external hull casing had been destroyed and {{the rear of the}} conning tower now showed significant damage. Following an April 2008 workshop by the Turkish Institute of Nautical Archaeology and the Submarine Institute of Australia, the recommendation was made against raising the wreck. Moving the submarine to a viewing tank, or alternately relocating the wreck to shallower water, were advised against because of the AU$80–100 million cost of such projects. Moving AE2 would also pose high risk to both the submarine and any vessels involved in the relocation; as well as potentially damaging the wreck, there is still an unexploded torpedo aboard. Instead, the workshop advised that the submarine be preserved through the use of sacrificial anodes to reduce corrosion, along with buoys and a surveillance system to mark the wreck and detect <b>unauthorised</b> <b>access</b> and potential damage.|$|E

This paper describes an innovative technical solution in the area of secure messaging that exploits Identifierbased Encryption (IBE) technology. It illustrates the advantages against a similar approach based on traditional cryptography and PKI. It discusses a few open issues. Our main contribution is a practical solutions based on IBE technology. A secure messaging system based on IBE has been fully implemented and it is currently used in a trial with a UK health service organization. 1...|$|R

The continuing migration to wireless means of data transfer has afforded system users more convenient and timely access to information via the use of 802. 11 based wireless network capable devices. Through the increased digital connectivity of these internet and wireless based networks, new avenues of criminal activity such as medical identity theft have been steadily increasing as malicious individuals and organisations seek to abuse the digital ubiquity of the electronic medical record. The increased need for vigilance, protective measures and tightened security policy surrounding patient data practices concerning the use of wireless devices has never been greater.

30|$|Using Fog {{platform}} for optimising web-services will also introduce web security issues. For example, if user input is not properly validated, the application becomes {{vulnerable to the}} code injection attacks, such as SQL injection, where SQL code provided by the user is automatically executed resulting in the potential for <b>unauthorised</b> data <b>access</b> and modification. This {{could result in the}} compromise of entire Fog system’s database or the forwarding of modified information to a central server [42]. Similarly, due to insecure web APIs, attacks like session and cookie hijacking (posing as a legitimate user), insecure direct object references for illegal data access, malicious redirections and drive-by attacks [43] could force a Fog platform to expose itself and the attached users. Web attacks can also be used for targeting other applications in the same Fog platform by embedding malicious scripts (cross-site scripting) and potentially damage sensitive information. A potential mitigation mechanism is to secure the application code, patch vulnerabilities, conduct periodic auditing, harden the firewall by defining ingress and egress traffic rules and add anti-malware protection.|$|R
