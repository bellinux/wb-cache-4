25|$|Mr. Ament left <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> after a delay here of five days. The Mark Twain {{article in}} the North American Review cut him like a knife and weighs deeply on him, but he takes it in a most {{beautiful}} spirit. The sympathy of all the Peking missionaries, and their absolute confidence in his integrity and the uprightness of his course {{has been a great}} help to him, and I think he goes back well prepared to set things right so far as he can in person. He plans to write a series of articles telling exactly what he has done. It will be a story worth telling, even if there were no occasion for it as a vindication of his character. I have been with him all this first week since he heard about the Sun and the Review articles. The calm and sweet spirit in which he has taken it and his brave resolution to set the matter right so far as in him lies, is answer enough for those who know of it.|$|E
500|$|Early {{practice}} speeds approached [...] NASCAR had mandated {{before the}} qualifier that {{the holes in}} the cars' restrictor plates be reduced by , later conceding that the rule may have affected some teams more than others. According to Gilliland, [...] "They threw a curveball at <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> with the restrictor plate and (engine builder) Doug Yates wasn't worried at all. He put the super-tune on it and the thing ran great." [...] Earnhardt called the reduction in speed unnecessary: [...] "The track is safe... I don't feel (the late change in plate size) is a very fair situation for everybody. Once you're up around the 190s, what's two miles an hour? I don't see what the big deal is. The speed average is up because the corner speed remains better with the new asphalt. As far as running in a straight line, we're no faster than we've always run here." [...] Despite the mandated change, NASCAR did not schedule an additional practice session.|$|E
2500|$|My God, I {{wish we had}} [...] 9th Australian Division with <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> [...]—Major General Freddie de Guingand, Chief of Staff, Allied Land-force Headquarters Europe, 1944.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hired him}} at Fort Pitt. He left <b>us</b> {{suddenly}} <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> A big man, with black beard and bushy eyebrows. A bit of his ear {{had been shot}} or cut out," [...] Sheppard replied.|$|R
6000|$|... "Truly, Surajah, fortune is favouring <b>us</b> mightily. <b>This</b> <b>morning,</b> {{we walked}} {{the streets in}} fear of being {{questioned}} and arrested. This evening we are officers of the Palace, favoured by Tippoo, and {{under the protection of}} the harem.|$|R
6000|$|... "The galley came in last night," [...] Gervaise said, [...] "but {{they did}} not land <b>us</b> until <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> I wish they had killed me rather than that I should have been brought here {{to work as a}} slave." ...|$|R
60|$|October 6.--Charles and {{his friend}} Surtees left <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "For all that," [...] he added, with an oath, [...] "and if he bursts by the wayside, he {{must bring}} <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> to the treasure." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing like it," [...] {{said the}} constable, looking up. [...] "Your missus gave ’em to <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> A little gravel on top, {{and there you}} are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Truly we {{have heard}} so, and a {{messenger}} came to <b>us</b> but <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> saying that {{they had come to}} deliver us from the Turks, and inviting us to go in thither and see them. Have you not received a message also?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{knew it was}} {{you last}} night. Don't go this evening. They'll be lying in wait for you. They're taking <b>us</b> away <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> I heard {{something}} about Wales--Holyhead, I think. I'll drop this on the road if I get a chance. Annette told me how you'd escaped. Buck up.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no!" [...] she declared. [...] "Mother can't bear travelling. A lot of <b>us</b> came up <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> at {{six o'clock}} on a day excursion, six shillings each." ...|$|R
60|$|Obliged {{to give up}} writing to-day--read Pepys instead. The Scotts of Harden were to have dined, but sent an apology,--storm coming on. Russells left <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> to go to Haining.|$|E
6000|$|... "But," [...] objected Queen Bee, [...] "if {{one of the}} {{children}} is ill, do you think Aunt Roger will like to have <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning?</b> and the post girl could take the jelly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hunting, I think," [...] replied Edward; [...] "at {{least he}} left <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> {{to join the}} Laird of Colmslie and his hounds. I have heard them baying in the glen all day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{manage it}} in half the time," [...] she said, with a hard, defiant laugh. [...] "Leave <b>us</b> {{together}} <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> as you left us at Dunwich, and take Mrs. Wragge with you, {{as an excuse for}} parting company. Is the paint dry yet? Go downstairs and tell him I am coming directly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wondrous happenings, sir," [...] said Grey Dick. [...] "Glad am I that we {{were not}} with you, lest the sight of them should have made <b>us</b> fearful on <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> of combat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us {{follow the}} example of all great golfers," [...] Hamel said. [...] "Let <b>us</b> for <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> at any rate, imagine that your whole world is {{encompassed}} within these eighteen holes. We have been sent here in a moment of good humour by your tyrant uncle. The sun shines, and the wind is from the west. Why not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So do mine," [...] Matteo agreed. [...] "In addition, I am hungry, for {{the bread}} they gave <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> was not fit for dogs, {{although}} I {{had to eat}} it, as it was that or nothing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Louis {{is remarkably}} fond of coming here," [...] said Elsie to Cora, {{who entered the}} room a few minutes later, [...] "but he {{did not come to}} see <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> He only came to ask after Herr Winklemann." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All you anti-railroad fellers {{ought to}} get together," [...] Mr. Bascom suggested; [...] "you've got us terrified since your friend from Leith turned the light of {{publicity}} on <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> I hear Ham Tooting's been in and made you an offer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Fips don't, I think,' was John's reply. 'But {{there he}} lives, Tom, {{and there he}} expects <b>us</b> to call <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> And now you know as much of this strange {{incident}} as I do, upon my honour.' ...|$|R
60|$|I am sure Robert {{has been}} too long about writing this time, dearest Sarianna. It did not strike either of <b>us</b> till <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> {{that it was so}} long. We have all been well; and Robert is whirled round and round so, in this most {{dissipated}} of places (to which Paris is really grave and quiet), that he scarcely knows if he stands on his feet or his head....|$|R
6000|$|... "If you {{had told}} them we were going, dear," [...] said Mrs. March, when the couple were {{themselves}} gone, [...] "we should have been as old as ever. Don't let <b>us</b> tell anybody, <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> that we're going. I couldn't bear it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's one thing, you old grumbler, it {{is quite}} certain he cannot do worse than you do. My jaws ache now with trying to eat the food you gave <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> Another week {{and you would have}} starved the whole band to death." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pooh!" [...] exclaimed {{the blue}} jay, [...] "we cannot be shot now, for we are stuffed. Indeed, two men fired several shots at <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> but the bullets only ruffled our {{feathers}} and buried themselves in our stuffing. We do not fear men now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{you have}} stolen a march upon <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> my dear General," [...] said Lord Woodville; [...] "or {{you have not}} found your bed so much to your mind as I had hoped and you seemed to expect. How did you rest last night?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The enemy {{thought to}} take us by surprise, {{yesterday}} evening; but we were ready for them, and our discharge killed over fifty. Then they drew off, and left <b>us</b> until <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> They made two great attacks: the first by throwing planks across the moat, and placing ladders at three places; the second by trying, again, to storm with ladders, while other bands tried to force their way in at this gateway, and at the two posterns.|$|R
60|$|The peasants were mighty {{kind and}} hearty, and flew around and {{did their best}} to make <b>us</b> comfortable. <b>This</b> <b>morning</b> I breakfasted on the shore in the open air with two sociable dogs and a cat. Clean cloth, napkin and table furniture, white sugar, a vast hunk of {{excellent}} butter, good bread, first class coffee with pure milk, fried fish just caught. Wonderful that so much cleanliness should come out of such a phenomenally dirty house.|$|R
60|$|Tide bothered <b>us</b> again <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> It seems {{exceedingly}} {{difficult to}} tell one night before what the tide {{is going to do}} the next morning. At ten o'clock we walked to the same place we were yesterday. It was a bright, warm day, with just enough breeze to ruffle the water and make fishing pleasant, and we certainly expected to have good luck. But we fished for about three hours without any sign of a fish. This was discouraging and we could not account for it.|$|R
6000|$|September 4.--Archie Swinton left <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> early. I wrote {{from seven}} to half-past two; but, partly that I had five proof-sheets to correct, partly that like old John Fraser[335] [...] "I {{was not very}} cleever to-day." [...] I made out but a page and a half.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your friends {{may have}} {{something}} to say to you," [...] he muttered. [...] "If you think to stop our tongues, you're wrong--wrong, I tell you. The game's up for you, Wingate. The wires that are ruining <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> will be telling of your arrest to-night, eh?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say not so," [...] {{cried the}} Marchioness. [...] "Our son, Lord Mordaunt Muddlenut, is young, handsome, all {{that a girl}} could desire. After months of {{wandering}} he returns to <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> It is our dearest wish to see him married and established. We offer you his hand." ...|$|E
6000|$|Nov. 23.--You {{will see}} that {{whatever}} turns up, I am sure to be in [...] the wrong. An invitation to Windsor for <b>us</b> came <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and I [...] am sorry to say one including Sunday--Nov. 30 to Dec. 2. I have [...] had a long battle with Peel on the matters of my office; not [...] another syllable. So {{far as it goes}} this tends to make me think he [...] does not calculate on any change in me; yet on the whole I lean the [...] other way. Manning comes up on Monday.|$|R
60|$|June 2.--The Lockharts left <b>us</b> again <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and {{although}} three masons are clanking at {{their work to}} clear a well, the noise is mitigated, now the poor babies' clang of tongues is removed. I set myself to write, determining to avoid reasoning, and to bring in as many stories as possible. Being a Teind Wednesday, I may work undisturbed, and I {{will try to get}} so far ahead as may permit a journey to Abbotsford on Saturday. At nine o'clock was as far ahead as page 57. It runs out well, and 150 pages will do.|$|R
60|$|Dear Sir,--Yours of yesterday, naming places, times, and {{terms for}} joint discussions between <b>us,</b> was {{received}} <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> Although, by the terms, as you propose, you take four openings and closes, to my three, I accede, and thus close the arrangement. I direct {{this to you}} at Hillsborough, and shall try to have both your letter and this appear in the Journal and Register of Monday morning.|$|R
