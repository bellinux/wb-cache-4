40|$|Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is {{developing}} sensors and controls {{to improve and}} extend electron beam materials processing technology to alloy systems with constituents of widely varying vapor pressure. The approach under development involves using tunable lasers to measure the density and composition of the vapor plume. A laser based vaporizer control system for vaporization of a uranium-iron alloy has been previously demonstrated in multi-hundred hour, high rate vaporization experiments at LLNL. This paper reviews the design and performance of the <b>uranium</b> <b>vaporization</b> sensor and control system and discusses {{the extension of the}} technology to monitoring of <b>uranium</b> <b>vaporization.</b> Data is presented from an experiment in which titanium wire was fed into a molten niobium pool. Laser data is compared to deposited film composition and film cross sections. Finally, the potential for using this technique for composition control in melting applications is discussed...|$|E
