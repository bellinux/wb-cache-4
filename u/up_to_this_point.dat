5|$|<b>Up</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> Gilchrist {{had played}} in 14 Tests, all in Australasia, and all {{of which had been}} won. Australia's run of 15 {{consecutive}} Test wins faced a steep challenge on the tour of India, where they had not won a Test series since 1969–70.|$|E
5|$|Expert systems {{restricted}} {{themselves to}} a small domain of specific knowledge (thus avoiding the commonsense knowledge problem) and their simple design made it relatively easy for programs to be built and then modified once they were in place.

5|$|In stage nine, Pierre Rolland, who {{was second}} in the {{mountains}} classification, wore the polka dot jersey, because Chris Froome wore the yellow jersey {{as leader of the}} general classification during that stage. Froome and Rolland both had collected 31 points <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> but Froome claimed the polka dot jersey, because he had crossed the line as first on first category mountains more often than Rolland.|$|E
5|$|In {{voting against}} the Force Bill, Tyler {{knew he would}} {{permanently}} alienate the pro-Jackson faction of the Virginia legislature, even those who had tolerated his irregularity <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>point.</b> This jeopardized his re-election in February 1833, in which he faced the pro-administration Democrat James McDowell; however, with Clay's endorsement, Tyler was re-elected {{by a margin of}} 12 votes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Up</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> {{the reserve}} opener Brown had scored 800 runs on tour {{at an average}} of 72.72, with a double century, three other centuries and 81 not out, and was on his third tour of England. In contrast, Harvey had totalled only 296 runs at 42.29 despite his unbeaten 100 against Sussex.|$|E

50|$|In cosmology, {{decoupling}} {{refers to}} a period {{in the development of}} the universe when different types of particles fall out of thermal equilibrium with each other. This occurs as a result of the expansion of the universe, as their interaction rates decrease (and mean free paths increase) <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> critical <b>point.</b> The two verified instances of decoupling since the Big Bang which are most often discussed are photon decoupling and neutrino decoupling, as these led to the cosmic microwave background and cosmic neutrino background, respectively.|$|R
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the 2014 WSOP APAC, there have been 1083 bracelets awarded, 500 of which were won by 170 players who have won at least two bracelets, with all of the other bracelets being won by one-time winners. This includes (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>point)</b> 17 Main Event winners: Hal Fowler, Bill Smith, Mansour Matloubi, Brad Daugherty, Jim Bechtel, Russ Hamilton, Noel Furlong, Robert Varkonyi, Chris Moneymaker, Greg Raymer, Joe Hachem, Jamie Gold, Jerry Yang, Peter Eastgate, Pius Heinz, Ryan Riess and Martin Jacobson.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the weather}} had been mostly rainy <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> in the campaign, a snow storm arrived the night of February 13, with strong winds that brought {{temperatures}} down to 10–12°F (−12°C) and deposited 3inches (8cm) of snow by morning. Guns and wagons were frozen to the earth. Because of {{the proximity of the}} enemy lines and the active sharpshooters, the soldiers could not light campfires for warmth or cooking, and both sides were miserable that night, many having arrived without blankets or overcoats.|$|E
5|$|Belgian Eddy Merckx was the {{dominant}} figure during the 1970s. His first victory came in 1968; another triumph in 1970 {{was followed by}} three successive victories from 1972 to 1974, which is {{the record for the}} most successive victories in the Giro. Felice Gimondi was victorious in 1976 winning his third Giro. Belgians Michel Pollentier and Johan De Muynck won the two subsequent Giros in 1977 and 1978. In 1980, Frenchman Bernard Hinault who <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> had won two Tours de France, became France's first winner since Anquetil in 1964. He would win another two Giros in 1982 and 1985.|$|E

30|$|Our {{assumption}} {{of all of}} the GBCA pooling in the left ventricle together with the radiotracer {{is likely to be a}}n overestimation of the true scenario. In practical circumstances, the GBCA in cardiac MR studies is injected at a rate of 3  ml/s. With a standard heart rate of 60  bpm, GBCA would be cleared rapidly from the ventricle, indicating that the true GBCA concentration during a dynamic acquisition is likely to be a lot lower that 66  mM. However, we have addressed a broad concentration range of GBCA <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> maximum <b>point.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Residents {{followed}} Fingerprince {{with their}} Duck Stab/Buster & Glen album – their most easily comprehensible album <b>up</b> <b>to</b> that <b>point.</b> <b>This</b> album got the band some {{attention from the}} press (namely NME, Sounds and Melody Maker), and dropped most of their reliance upon the Theory of Obscurity.|$|R
5|$|Denard Robinson had {{perhaps his}} worst game <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> in the season: he threw three interceptions and {{was held to}} only 84 yards rushing. This {{marked the first time}} that Michigan State had {{defeated}} Michigan {{three years in a row}} since they accomplished this feat from 1965–1967. The announced crowd of 113,065 was, at the time, the second largest crowd ever at Michigan Stadium. As a testament to Michigan's ongoing kicking woes, the field goal in the first half was Michigan's first attempt since the game against UMass and the first converted kick since the game against Connecticut.|$|E
5|$|Gilchrist {{made his}} Test match {{debut in the}} First Test against Pakistan at the Gabba in Brisbane in November 1999 {{becoming}} the 381st Australian Test cricketer. He replaced Healy, who was dropped after a run of poor form, despite the incumbent's entreaties to the selectors to allow him a farewell game {{in front of his}} home crowd. Gilchrist's entry into the Test arena coincided with a dramatic rise in Australia's fortunes. <b>Up</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> they had played eight Tests in 1999, winning and losing three.|$|E
5|$|He was {{subsequently}} dropped for the ODI series, playing {{in only one}} match in which he conceded 67 runs without picking up a wicket in 8 overs. However, he did manage to post his first ODI half-century, scoring 64, defiantly holding up his end as India were bowled out for 213, sealing a 106-run loss. Greg Chappell became {{the coach of the}} Indian team following the Pakistan series and identified Pathan as a potential all-rounder. He started to hone Pathan's batting skills, which had <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> yielded 275 Test runs at 19.64.|$|E
50|$|This gravity-based {{structure}} for a platform was {{unique in that}} it was built from reinforced concrete instead of steel, which was the norm <b>up</b> <b>to</b> that <b>point.</b> <b>This</b> platform type was designed for the heavy weather conditions and the great water depths often found in the North Sea.|$|R
50|$|A {{change was}} made to the group stage matches where teams played to a best of three sets {{instead of the usual}} 5 sets, <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 15 <b>points.</b> <b>This</b> {{decision}} {{was made to}} benefit teams who have to play more matches in the same day to prevent wearing out the players.|$|R
50|$|The concert {{began at}} 7:30 p.m. and ended at 3:20 a.m. - the longest Phish concert <b>up</b> <b>to</b> that <b>point.</b> <b>This</b> {{is also the}} longest volume in the Live Phish Series {{consisting}} of material from one night (Volume 16 is the longest including filler) clocking in at just over four hours.|$|R
5|$|In the 2002–03 WNCL, Ebsary {{played in}} all eight matches, but was given less {{responsibility}} {{with the ball}} and had little success. She bowled only 23 overs and took two wickets at 34.00. She also had little effect with the bat, scoring 63 runs at 11.50 with a best score of 18. South Australia won five of their matches, narrowly missing the finals. <b>Up</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> her batting average in 16 completed innings was 8.37.|$|E
5|$|Macartney scored 84 but the {{tourists}} {{started on a}} bad note, losing to Nottinghamshire. He then scored 127 against Northamptonshire, 208 against Essex, 123 and 25 not out against Surrey and 74 against the Marylebone Cricket Club in four consecutive matches. Australia won the first two by an innings and the latter two by seven and five wickets respectively. <b>Up</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> Macartney had only claimed a solitary wicket. He then took match figures of 6/60 in a ten-wicket win over Oxford University.|$|E
5|$|Matters {{became more}} {{complicated}} in 1954, when the Independent Subway System (IND) started operating D trains on the Culver Line. At the time, the tracks had lettered names (i.e. Track A, Track B, {{all the way}} to Track H from east to west). However, the IND also used lettered designations for its routes (i.e. A, B, {{all the way to}} H as well). The BMT had used numbered route designations <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> so this had not been a problem. However, the D route was now using the Culver Line, which departed from tracks E and F. To avoid confusion, the tracks were renamed with numbered designations, which they still carry.|$|E
50|$|The Featured Skill was Side-by-side Jumps.

50|$|Ellsworth was {{a bustling}} cattle {{town for a}} time during the late 1860s, when the Kansas Pacific Railroad had a stop and stockyards there. Cattle were driven <b>up</b> from Texas <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> and then shipped to major markets. Often cowboys had {{the run of the}} town. In 1875 Kansas Pacific closed its cattle pens, moving to another location. The cattle trade dwindled to almost nothing by the mid-1880s.|$|R
5000|$|The {{majority}} {{of the book is}} a first-person account written by the protagonist, Calvin Johnson. It begins with a scene of his finding the Lincolnshire farm and continues with a long flashback told in chronological order <b>up</b> <b>to</b> that <b>point.</b> <b>This</b> narration is followed by his diary at the farm. The book ends with a [...] "postscript" [...] by its editor, another character.|$|R
5|$|On the {{opposite}} bank of the river, Superior Avenue climbs a hill past the Evergreen Cemetery at the top. The section of roadway <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> carries {{the highest levels of}} traffic as measured by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) in their annual average daily traffic (AADT) surveys. Some 3,900vehicles used this segment of trunkline daily in 2007. Outside of town, the trunkline runs south of Runkle Lake through hilly, wooded terrain. The roadway crosses the southern section of the Michigamme River west of the Dickinson County line.|$|E
5|$|Route22 {{continues}} heading northeast along {{a narrow}} strip of land between the East Branch and Bog Brook reservoirs. It then resumes its northward heading, following a much straighter course than it had <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> on two lanes through wooded areas {{of the town of}} Patterson, where two local state highways, NY312 and 164, come in from the west. The highway gradually expands to three and sometimes four lanes as it passes through built-up areas of strip development. Shortly after intersecting a third state highway, NY311, and passing another strip plaza, NY22 crosses into Dutchess County.|$|E
5|$|Ryse: Son of Rome {{is set in}} an {{alternate}} version of Rome. The game's tutorial section depicts Marius (voiced by John Hopkins) leading the defense of Rome against oncoming Celtic barbarians led by Boudica (Rachel McDowall). Marius hands a small, nondescript sack to a subordinate with the instructions to display it from an elevated position, then helps secure the Roman emperor, Nero (Sebastian Abineri), in a private safe room. At the emperor's behest he begins to tell his story; {{the rest of the}} game is an extended flashback depicting Marius' story <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E
60|$|Travel was resumed then, with Roy {{a little}} {{in advance of the}} pack-train. Presently he dismounted, threw his bridle, and {{cautiously}} peered ahead. Then, turning, he waved his sombrero. The pack-animals halted in a bunch. Dale beckoned for the girls to follow and rode <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Roy's horse. <b>This</b> <b>point,</b> Helen saw, {{was at the top of}} an intersecting canuon. Dale dismounted, without drawing his rifle from its saddle-sheath, and approached Roy.|$|R
50|$|In 1966 {{the company}} went through major {{restructuring}} {{with all of the}} companies coming under Harleysville Mutual. During the next decade and a half the company progressively wrote more commercial volume as opposed to the emphasis on personal lines that it had seen <b>up</b> <b>to</b> that <b>point.</b> <b>This</b> culminated in the addition of a number of subsidiaries <b>to</b> keep <b>up</b> with the changes to the insurance industry that happened during that time. In 1979 Harleysville Group Inc. was founded.|$|R
5|$|The {{prosperity}} stimulated {{a building}} boom that was underway by the mid-1830s, {{with the building}} {{of some of the}} most elaborate structures the city had seen <b>up</b> <b>to</b> that <b>point.</b> <b>This</b> was cut short in part by the Panic of 1837 and yellow fever epidemics. The waterfront was developed with wharves, terminal facilities, and fireproof brick warehouses. The exports of cotton grew in proportion to the amounts being produced in the Black Belt; by 1840 Mobile was second only to New Orleans in cotton exports in the nation.|$|R
