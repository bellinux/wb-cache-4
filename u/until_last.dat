5|$|The other port lifeboat, {{with four}} crew on board, {{was picked up}} by the steamer Leichhardt at an island at the {{entrance}} to Whitsunday Passage two days after the disaster. The steamer immediately reversed course back towards the wreck, which she reached at approximately 3.30pm on Friday, 26 February. Gothenburg was a complete wreck; the funnel was gone and she had sunk to the eyes of the lower rigging. Leichhardts Chief Officer and four hands went alongside, but nothing other than her masts could be seen above the water except for the body of a naked man floating nearby. They assumed the other victims had been taken by sharks. Leichhardt searched for survivors <b>until</b> <b>last</b> light and then made way for Bowen where the alarm was raised.|$|E
5|$|In {{composing}} the Savoy operas, Sullivan {{wrote the}} vocal {{lines of the}} musical numbers first, and these {{were given to the}} actors. He, or an assistant, improvised a piano accompaniment at the early rehearsals; he wrote the orchestrations later, after he had seen what Gilbert's stage business would be. He left the overtures <b>until</b> <b>last</b> and often delegated their composition, based on his outlines, to his assistants, often adding his suggestions or corrections. Those Sullivan wrote himself include Thespis, Iolanthe, Princess Ida, The Yeomen of the Guard, The Gondoliers, The Grand Duke and probably Utopia Limited. Most of the overtures are structured as a potpourri of tunes from the operas in three sections: fast, slow and fast. Those for Iolanthe and The Yeomen of the Guard are written in a modified sonata form. The overtures from the Gilbert and Sullivan operas remain popular, and there are many recordings of them. Sullivan invariably conducted the operas on their opening nights.|$|E
5|$|The 2/14th Battalion {{had been}} {{dispatched}} from Myola on foot on 25 August, with orders {{to relieve the}} 39th. A company reached their position at Isurava {{in the middle of}} the afternoon on 26 August, while others deployed to Alola and Templeton's Crossing. However, the 39th was forced to remain in location while the 2/14th's companies moved into position one by one, as several times the Japanese threatened to break through the perimeter. It was not <b>until</b> <b>last</b> light on 27 August that the 39th moved into a reserve location to the rear of Isurava. Throughout the day, heavy close quarters fighting had taken place around Isurava, while on the right flank hand-to-hand fighting had seen both the Australians and Japanese assume cautious defensive postures. Probing attacks continued around Isurava that night as the Japanese sought to test the Australian defences for weaknesses amidst a heavy torrential downpour.|$|E

25|$|Several factors {{combine to}} put credit unions {{at risk of}} failure.

25|$|Throughout January patrols from 9 RAR {{had fought}} {{small groups of}} Viet Cong daily, and on {{occasions}} encountered groups of platoon and sometimes company-sized. Numerous bunker complexes and camps were also uncovered. Although most contacts were minor, at times these encounters led to prolonged fighting. At 12:20 on 5 January 4 Platoon, B Company contacted five Viet Cong and in the ensuing action two were killed while one Australian died of wounds. At the same time D Company contacted a Viet Cong base camp, losing five men wounded. The following day 5 Platoon, B Company was contacted at 12:00 and suffered one killed and five wounded, while the Assault Pioneer Platoon later uncovered a sizeable cache of ammunition. On 10 January, A Company struck a large bunker system and was engaged with heavy machine-guns which pinned down an Australian platoon. During the company action that ensued the remaining to Australian platoons conducted a flanking assault with bayonets fixed {{under the cover of}} mortars and artillery. Two Australians were killed and the battle continued for three-and-a-half hours <b>until</b> <b>last</b> light. Another assault the following morning by A Company supported by tanks found the camp abandoned by the Viet Cong. Meanwhile, in AO Warrigul 4 RAR/NZ continued to find a number of small camps and bunker systems. During the morning D Company had had a number of fleeting contacts while setting up ambush locations and had also located a battalion-sized bunker system. However at 16:30 11 Platoon D Company contacted up to 10 Viet Cong in a bunker system, and in the ensuing clash the Australians killed two before withdrawing under the cover of artillery due to the weight of defensive fire. An air strike was subsequently used to destroy the camp, probably killing three more Viet Cong. A sweep of the area by the Australians at first light the next day found no weapons or any other material. Late on the evening of 11 January a New Zealand soldier from 3 Platoon, W Company was accidentally killed by friendly fire after firing broke out in response to noises heard on the company perimeter; an incident which clearly illustrated the difficulties and dangers of operating in the jungle at night. Two days 4 RAR/NZ was relieved by 1 RAR, and returned to Nui Dat.|$|E

In May 1863 he sketched eight bars which he eventually used in the love duet [...] "Faithful love can't be marred", and later that summer, while still awaiting Sabina's revised libretto, he wrote the theme of the comic number [...] "We'll make a pretty little thing". He also produced a piano version of the entire overture, which was performed in a public concert on 18 November.

[...] Nevertheless, the letters provoked a reaction from The Simpsons staff, and in an interview, Scully said, [...] "We {{got a couple of}} hundred letters, and it was very obvious from reading a majority of them that [...] had not seen the show.

500|$|Arboreal woodpeckers, which {{depend on}} their tails—particularly the strong central pair of rectrices—for support while they feed, have a unique tail moult. [...] Rather than {{moulting}} their central tail feathers first, as most birds do, they retain these feathers <b>until</b> <b>last.</b> [...] Instead the second pair of rectrices (both R2 feathers) {{are the first to}} drop. (In some species in the genera Celeus and Dendropicos, the third pair is the first dropped.) The pattern of feather drop and replacement proceeds as described for passerines (above) until all other rectrices have been replaced; only then are the central tail rectrices moulted. [...] This provides some protection to the growing feathers, since they're always covered by at least one existing feather, and also ensures that the bird's newly strengthened tail is best able to cope with the loss of the crucial central rectrices. [...] Ground-feeding woodpeckers, such as the wrynecks, do not have this modified moult strategy; in fact, wrynecks moult their outer tail feathers first, with moult proceeding proximally from there.|$|E

500|$|Humber was {{promoted}} to the Mets, again as a September call-up, on September 2. Though the Mets considered inserting him into the starting rotation immediately, they chose to start Pelfrey. Humber made two relief appearances for the Mets, on September 5 and 11. The Mets, having lost eight of their previous 12 games and seen their lead over the Philadelphia Phillies in the National League East division race decrease from seven games to two, removed Pelfrey from the final rotation to give an extra day of rest to pitchers Pérez, Maine, and Pedro Martínez, and gave Humber his first Major League start on September 26, 2007, against the Washington Nationals, choosing him over Dave Williams. Although the Mets raced out to a 6–2 lead, Humber allowed five runs in four-plus innings, receiving a no decision in a game the Mets eventually lost, 9–6. The decision to start Humber was seen as emblematic of the Mets' desperation. As George Vecsey wrote in The New York Times, [...] "How did it come to this? How did the entire Mets' season come to depend so much on a young pitcher, Philip Humber, who had never started {{in the major leagues}} <b>until</b> <b>last</b> night?" [...] He concluded his three Mets appearances in the 2007 season with a 7.71 ERA.|$|E
500|$|The Seattle Mariners {{franchise}} {{was established}} in 1977, the successor to the earlier Pilots team that moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In their inaugural season, the Mariners hired Darrell Johnson as their first manager; he led the team for parts of four seasons, {{through the middle of}} 1980. After that point, no Mariners skipper started his new tenure {{at the beginning of the}} season until Jim Snyder in 1989. Statistically, Lou Piniella is the most successful manager in Mariners history; he is the franchise leader in games managed (1,551), regular-season wins and losses (840–711), and winning percentage (.542). He is also the only Mariners skipper to appear in the postseason, accruing a 15–19 record in 34 playoff games, and is the only person to win the Manager of the Year Award with the club, capturing the award in 1995 and 2001. Don Wakamatsu, the first Asian-American manager in Major League Baseball history, was the team's skipper from 2009 until he was fired on August 9, 2010.
