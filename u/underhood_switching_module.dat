In this article, we present a class of universal <b>switch</b> <b>modules.</b> Each of our <b>switch</b> <b>modules</b> has 6 W switches and switch-module flexibility three (i. e., FS � 3). We prove that no <b>switch</b> <b>module</b> with less than 6 W switches can be universal. We also compare our <b>switch</b> <b>modules</b> with those used in the Xilinx XC 4000 family FPGAs and the antisymmetric <b>switch</b> <b>modules</b> (with FS � 3) 1 suggested by Rose and Brown [1991]. Although these two kinds of <b>switch</b> <b>modules</b> also have FS � 3 and 6 W switches, we show that they are not universal. Based on combinatorial counting techniques, we show that each of our universal <b>switch</b> <b>modules</b> can accommodate up to 25 % more routing instances, compared with the XC 4000 -type <b>switch</b> <b>module</b> of the same size. Experimental results demonstrate that our universal <b>switch</b> <b>modules</b> improve routability at the chip level.

40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} a <b>switch</b> <b>module</b> routing problem for symmetrical-array field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA’s). This problem {{was first introduced}} in [21]. They used it to evaluate the routability properties of <b>switch</b> <b>modules</b> which they proposed. Only an approximation algorithm for the problem was proposed by them. We give an optimal algorithm for the problem based on integer linear programming (ILP). Experiments show that this formulation leads to fast and efficient solutions to practical-sized problems. We then propose a precomputation that eliminates the need to use ILP on-line. We also identify special cases of this problem that reduce to problems for whom efficient algorithms are known. Thus, the <b>switch</b> <b>module</b> routing problem can be solved in polynomial time for these special cases. Using our solution to the <b>switch</b> <b>module</b> routing problem, we propose a new metric to estimate the congestion in each <b>switch</b> <b>module</b> in the FPGA. We demonstrate {{the use of this}} metric in a global router. A comparison with a global router guided by the density of the routing channels shows that our metric leads to far superior global and detailed routing solutions.

The first is that of efficiently evaluating <b>switch</b> <b>module</b> designs [9]. The second is that of evaluating the routability of global routing paths for a placement on this architecture. Only an approximate algorithm was previously known for this problem. In this paper, we present an optimal algorithm for the problem based on integer linear programming.

40|$|In a {{broadcast}} connection through a multi-stage network, an input port can {{be connected to}} more than one output port, with the restriction that at no time can an output port be connected {{to more than one}} input port. We present new constructive designs for nonblocking multi-stage switching networks for realizing broadcast connections. Our nonblocking connecting capability is based on the adherence to a connection path set-up strategy as implemented by a network control algorithm. In three-stage versions of our designs wherein there are.,. <b>switch</b> <b>modules</b> in each of the first and third stages, n input ports on each-switch module in the first stage and n output ports on each <b>switch</b> <b>module</b> in the third stage, the strategy demands that any broadcast connection be realized using at most z middle switches, where 1 ~ z ~ min{n- I,.,. }.

However expanding this switch so that the performance grows linearly with the number of processing elements (N) is costly and complicated. The size of the switch grows as a function of N 2.
