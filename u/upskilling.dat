5000|$|Note: [...] "Valorisation" [...] is {{nowadays}} also a term used, {{particularly on}} the European mainland, in the vocational training community, in academia and in project management.

In this modern sense of the word, the European Commission defines the term as [...] "a process of exploiting project learning and outcomes (training products and processes, methodology, course materials etc.) {{with a view to}} optimising their value and impact in existing and new contexts (target groups, companies, sectors, training institutions and systems etc.). This meaning is unrelated to Marx's concept, other than the reference to making the best use of an activity or getting the best value out of it for all concerned.

5000|$|Finally, {{there is}} a human capital {{dimension}} {{to the failure of}} post-Soviet reforms in Russia. The former Soviet population was not necessarily uneducated. Literacy was nearly universal, and the educational level of the Soviet population was {{among the highest in the}} world with respect to science, engineering, and some technical disciplines, although the Soviets devoted little to what would be described as [...] "liberal arts" [...] in the West. With the move to a post-Communist system, the Russian university system collapsed. Rampant credential inflation in the Russian university system made it difficult for employers to determine who was really skilled and the problems of the higher education system more generally made it difficult to remedy other issues of human capital that came from the transition to a market-oriented system, such as <b>upskilling</b> and re-skilling. [...] For example, former state enterprise managers were highly skilled at coping with the demands on them under the Soviet system of planned production targets, but discouraged the risk-and-reward centered behavior of market capitalism. These managers were responsible for a broad array of social welfare functions for their employees, their families, and the population of the towns and regions where they were located. Profitability and efficiency, however, were generally not the most prominent priorities for Soviet enterprise managers. Thus, almost no Soviet employees or managers had firsthand experience with decision-making in the conditions of a market economy.|$|E

40|$|This paper summarises the {{changing}} nature of qualifications across the working age population in New Zealand over the period from 1986 to 2001, and investigates the relationships between {{the changing}} qualification distribution and employment and income. First, the results confirm that there was a general <b>upskilling</b> of the population, as measured by formal educational qualifications. Second, we examine patterns of qualification change and employment growth measured in job groups, and find that the <b>upskilling</b> of the population occurred across a wide range of job-groups. Also, although the results show the employment growth was strongest in job-groups with high initial levels of skilled workers, employment growth is only weakly related to <b>upskilling.</b> Third, we decompose the change in the value of human capital into contributions due to changes in the qualification mix, changes in the (economic) returns to qualifications, and the interaction between these two factors. The value of human capital increased by 20 % over the period: about 75 % of this increase can be attributed to increasing incomes holding constant the mix of qualifications, 15 - 20 % to an increasing skill mix, and the residual to interaction effects.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to provide empirical evidence on the relationships among new technologies, innovative work practices and <b>upskilling</b> in the Spanish case. Design/methodology/approach – Using detailed plant-level data from a survey of Spanish manufacturing firms, we apply estimation methods, such as tobit and ordered probit models, to test the hypothesis that the use of ICT, AMT, and innovative work practices is positively related to <b>upskilling.</b> Findings – As available empirical evidence shows for other countries, we have found that AMT, ICT and innovative work practices are positively related to skills, although they have different effects on workforce composition and training. We have also found several significant effects of the interactive terms of the three technologies and work practices considered on the selected variables of <b>upskilling.</b> Research limitations/implications – The main limitation is the lack of time series data. Cross-sectional data do not allow the use of lagged variables and make it impossible to analyse the evolution of the adoption of new technologies and work practices by firms and their dynamic effects on skills, or to study causalities among variables. In addition, the study relates only to manufacturing industries. Further research should consider expanding the analysis to the service sector and studying possible complementarities between technology and work practices, in terms of labor cost savings. Originality/value – This paper offers empirical evidence for Spain on the relationship between new technologies, innovative work practices and <b>upskilling</b> considered jointly. It analyses two different technologies: ICT and AMT. The paper also focuses on different dimensions of <b>upskilling.</b> Advanced manufacturing technologies, Communication technologies, Flexible organizations, Innovation, Skills, Spain...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurposeOphthalmic {{technicians}} (OT) work {{at health}} facilities in Mozambique and {{are trained to}} provide primary and secondary eye care services including basic refraction. This {{study was designed to}} assess OT competence and confidence in refraction, and investigate whether an <b>upskilling</b> programme is effective in developing their competence and confidence at refraction. MethodsThirty-one trainee OTs and 16 qualified OTs were recruited to the study. A background questionnaire was administered to determine the demographic profile of the OTs. A confidence levels questionnaire explored their self-reported skills. Clinical competencies were assessed in relation to knowledge (theory exam) and clinical skills (patient exams). 11 OTs were upskilled and the clinical evaluations carried out post training. ResultsInitial evaluations demonstrated that confidence and competence levels varied depending on the OTs training (location and duration), and their location of work (clinical load, availability of equipment and other eye care personnel). The qualified OTs were more competent than trainee OTs in most of the evaluations. Post <b>upskilling</b> results demonstrated significant positive impact on confidence and competence levels. ConclusionThese evaluations identified factors affecting the refraction competencies of the OTs and demonstrated that <b>upskilling</b> is effective in improving confidence and competence levels for refraction. They demonstrate the need for a refraction competency framework. The overarching aim of this research was to inform the development of a nationwide programme of OT mentoring, <b>upskilling</b> and leading to the establishment of clinical competency standards for the new OT curricula, relevant to the professional demands...|$|E
