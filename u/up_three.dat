5|$|By about 19:30, Marlboroughs pumps had {{contained}} the flooding in the boiler rooms {{but she took}} {{on a list of}} around 7–8degrees. Instead of using counter-flooding to minimise the list, her crew attempted to correct the list by using coal and oil from the starboard bunkers first. The list caused the generators supplying power to the main battery turrets to flood, hampering the gun crews, particularly as shells were transferred from the magazines to the turrets. The blast from the torpedo was so powerful that forty watertight compartments were damaged, though the torpedo bulkhead localised most of the damage and the more badly damaged compartments were sufficiently shored <b>up.</b> <b>Three</b> more torpedoes approached Marlborough at 19:33. She evaded the first two and the third harmlessly passed under the ship.|$|E
