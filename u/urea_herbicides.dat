5000|$|The {{ornamental}} {{flower of}} the Oxalis glabra {{has made it}} a desirable addition to gardens, however it is often classified as a weed. Due to its underground growth process the Oxalis is difficult to eradicate. A single bulb can propagate into many independent plants and yield many more bulbils. The small size of the bulbs make them hard to detect and easy to spread. The plant grows in a dense carpet and can choke out indigenous species; if introduced to a disturbed community Oxalis glabra will prevent native plants from repopulating the community. Destroying the shoots of the plant are ineffective as well as hand digging because bulbs easily break free and remain in soil. Glyphosate, diuron and sulfonyl <b>urea</b> <b>herbicides</b> are most effective in eradication; herbicides should be applied at first sight of flowering because at this stage the bulbs will be exhausted.|$|E

Similarity dendrograms showed that the microbial community structures of the herbicide-treated and nontreated soils were Significantly different, Moreover, the bacterial diversity seemed to decrease in sops treated with <b>urea</b> <b>herbicides,</b> and sequence determination of several DGGE fragments showed that the most affected species in the soils treated with diuron and linuron belonged to an uncultivated bacterial group, As well as the 16 S rDNA fingerprints, the substrate utilization patterns of the microbial communities were compared, Principal-component analysis performed on BIOLOG data showed that the functional abilities of the soil microbial communities were, altered by the application of the herbicides. In addition, enrichment cultures of the different soils in medium with the <b>urea</b> <b>herbicides</b> as the sole carbon and nitrogen source showed that {{there was no difference between}} treated and nontreated soil in the rate of transformation of diuron and chlorotoluron but that there was a strong difference in the case of linuron, In the enrichment cultures with linuron-treated soil, linuron disappeared completely after 1 week whereas no significant transformation aas observed in cultures inoculated with nontreated soil even after 4 weeks, In conclusion, this study showed that both the structure and metabolic potential of soil microbial communities were clearly affected by a long-term application of <b>urea</b> <b>herbicides...</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe herbicide, Galex, {{containing}} 25 % of metolachlor and 25 % of metobromuron {{dissolved in}} 46. 7 % emulsifiable concentrate was widely {{used for the}} control of grasses and broad-leaf weeds in the 1990 s {{and continues to be}} used today. Metobromuron, a substitute <b>urea</b> <b>herbicide,</b> may cause methemoglobinemia in humans, but very few studies are available about the harmful effects on humans. We report here a case where a 47 -year-old man developed severe methemoglobinemia 10 hours after ingestion of 1000 mL of Galex. Acute hypoxic respiratory failure with coma occurred suddenly. After ventilator support was instituted, intravenous methylene blue (1 %, 2 mg/kg) was administrated immediately. A second dose of methylene blue was given because of a persistent high level of methemoglobin 2 hours later. The patient was weaned from the ventilator on day 4. However, hemolytic anemia, possibly due to the administration of methylene blue, occurred and persisted to day 11. This resolved gradually only after multiple blood transfusions. Ingestion of a large volume of herbicide containing metobromuron, a substituted <b>urea</b> <b>herbicide,</b> can induce late-onset methemoglobinemia in humans and, while rare, may be fatal if not observed for a sufficient time in the emergency department. Death is possible following the ingestion of this herbicide when adequate diagnoses and treatment are not instituted. Methylene blue is useful in reversing methemoglobinemia, but the side effects such as hemolytic anemia should be monitored, especially at doses exceeding 4 mg/kg or in patients with glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD) deficiency. Clinicians should consider the relevant history of G 6 PD deficiency before using methylene blue to decrease the risk of unnecessary hemolytic anemia. Methemoglobinemia in patients with G 6 PD deficiency is best treated with blood transfusions...|$|R

Hence, the occurrence {{in the field of}} a microbiota having the capacity to degrade a specific herbicide was related to the long-term treatment of the soil. The enrichment culture isolated from treated soil showed specific degradation activity towards methoxy-methyl <b>urea</b> <b>herbicides,</b> such as linuron and metobromuron, while dimethyl <b>urea</b> <b>herbicides,</b> such as diuron, chlorotoluron, and isoproturon, were not transformed. The putative metabolic intermediates of linuron and metobromuron, the aniline derivatives 3, 4 -dichloroaniline and 4 -bromoaniline, were also degraded. The temperature of incubation drastically affected degradation of the aniline derivatives. Whereas linuron was transformed at 28 and 37 degreesC, 3, 4 -dichloroaniline was transformed only at 28 degreesC. Monitoring the enrichment process by reverse transcription-PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) showed that a mixture of bacterial species under adequate physiological conditions was required to completely transform linuron, This research indicates that for biodegradation of linuron, several years of adaptation have led to selection of a bacterial consortium capable of completely transforming linuron, Moreover, several of the putative species appear to be difficult to culture since they were detectable by DGGE but were not culturable on agar plates...|$|E

In order to study these parameters, we developed a method to differentiate between the four members of a linuron degrading consortium using FISH and reporter genes. Variovorax sp. WDL 1 is the key member of the consortium as it degrades linuron to 3, 4 -dichloroaniline (3, 4 -DCA) and another intermediate. Variovorax sp. WDL 1 is able to mineralize 3, 4 -DCA but probably due to cross-feeding interactions Comamonas testosteroni WDL 7 takes part in 3, 4 -DCA mineralization. Hyphomicrobium sulfonivorans WDL 6 degrades the intermediate N,O-dimethylhydroxylamine. The fourth member, i. e. Pseudomonas sp.

A genus-specific 16 S rRNA targeting oligonucleotide probe was designed to identify Variovorax spp. Comamonas testosteroni WDL 7 was labeled with a reporter gene encoding for the fluorescent protein Gfp, and a fluorescent nucleic acid stain (DAPI) was used to differentiate Hyphomicrobium sulfonivorans from the specifically labeled strains. The method developed showed to be effective in differentiating between Variovorax sp. WDL 1, Comamonas testosteroni WDL 7 and Hyphomicrobium sulfonivorans WDL 6.

Linuron may be applied preplant, preemergence, postemergence, or post transplant using ground equipment. The registered modes of application are band treatment, directed spray, or broadcast spray. The most current EPA records show 9 active end-use product registrations and 5 technical grades of linuron. End-use products include wettable powder (50 % a. i.), flowable concentrate (40. 6 % a. i.), water dispersable granules (50 % a. i.), and liquid suspensions. Linuron functions as an herbicide through the inhibition of photosynthesis.

The present 7 -day study evaluated the dose-dependent effects of urothelial alterations in the urinary bladder using histology, scanning-electron microscopy (SEM) and transcriptional profiling with Affymetrix microarrays. Six-week old male Wistar rats were treated with 0, 125, 500, 2500 ppm of diuron in the diet for 7 days. The numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the exposed groups increased with dose. Diuron affected several functions involved with cell-to-cell interaction and tissue disorganization at transcriptional level, however, 7 days of exposure seemed to be insufficient to cause morphological lesions. Comparison of the gene expression observed at 7 -day and 20 - week time points indicates more differences than similarities. The present data suggests an initial adaptive response to protect the urothelium to the continuous exposure to diuron. By the 20 th week, the protective response is suppressed and the mucosa develops simple hyperplasia, a morphologic consequence of cytotoxicity and necrosis followed by a continuous replacement of the epithelium.

Comamonas testosteroni WDL 7 was labeled with a reporter gene encoding for the fluorescent protein Rfp, while Hyphomicrobium sulfonivorans WDL 6 was equipped with an Yfp encoding gene cassette. A fluorescent nucleic acid stain (DAPI) was used to distinguish Variovorax sp. WDL 1 from the specifically labeled strains. The structural interactions between the community members grown as mixed biofilms were studied in flow chambers by means of Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM). Under selective nutrient conditions with linuron as sole source of carbon and nitrogen (0, 2 mM), the consortium members formed an heterogeneous biofilm with a single layer base and randomly positioned mushroom-like structures. These structures consisted mainly of associated Comamonas and Variovorax cells with very few Hyphomicrobia. However, more downstream some of the mushroom-like structures consisted almost exclusively of Hyphomicrobium cells. On the other hand, when the consortium was fed with a non-selective carbon source, i. e. citrate, both structure and organization of the biofilm was altered.

Male Wistar rats were divided into 3 groups: control (basal diet), 7. 1 % Sodium Saccharin (NaS) (positive control) and 2500 ppm diuron, and fed for 7 days or 15 weeks. Urinary bladders were fixed with Bouin’s or glutaraldehyde fixative and processed by critical point drying (CPD) or by hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) for comparison of the cytotoxic and proliferative changes induced by diuron in the urothelium.

Recently, several multispecies microbial communities mineralizing phenyl <b>urea</b> <b>herbicides</b> such as linuron have been isolated from treated agricultural soils, indicating that bacteria adapt to the contamination (Dejonghe et al., 2003). In this study we tried to isolate new linuron mineralizing bacteria to study whether complete linuron mineralization in soil is commonly performed by consortia or by single strains. Additionally the structural organization of a linuron metabolizing multispecies consortium on a solid surface was studied. Enrichment cultures degrading linuron were obtained from two linuron treated agricultural soils (DKE and BEH). DNA fingerprint analysis showed that cultures from the two soils were different and complex in composition. Complete mineralization of linuron was proven by 14 C-labeled linuron mineralization experiments. One and five linuron metabolizing strains were isolated from soil DKE and soil BEH, respectively. Although some of those isolates also grow on 3, 4 -dichloroaniline (3, 4 -DCA), together with N,O-DMHA the primary degradation product of linuron, unique 3, 4 -DCA degraders could be isolated from both soils. In addition, Hyphomicrobia which are known for their N,O-DMHA degrading capabilities, could be identified. These results indicate that linuron is metabolized in soil by a consortium rather than by a single pollutant mineralizing strain. The structural interactions between the linuron degrading consortium members (Variovorax sp. WDL 1, Comamonas testosteroni WDL 7 and Hyphomicrobium sulfonivorans WDL 6) grown as mixed biofilms were studied in flow chambers by means of CLSM. Under selective conditions with linuron as sole source of carbon and nitrogen, the consortium members formed a heterogeneous biofilm with mushroom-like structures. These structures consisted mainly of associated Comamonas and Variovorax cells with very few Hyphomicrobia. However, more downstream, mushroom-like structures consisted almost exclusively of Hyphomicrobium cells. On the other hand, when the consortium was fed with a non-selective carbon source, i. e. citrate, the synergistic association between the bacteria was lost and Comamonas testosteroni WDL 7 became the dominant member forming a homogeneous multilayered biofilm. It shows that different nutrient conditions such as carbon substrate have a profound effect on both structure and organization of a synergistic pollutant degrading biofilm. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Large {{amounts of}} <b>urea</b> and various <b>herbicides</b> {{are applied to}} Chilean Andisols by farmers; however, how {{different}} herbicide types affect bacterial communities in urea-fertilized soils remains unknown. In this study, the effect of post-emergent herbicides (MCPA, flumetsulam, fluroxypyr, triclopyr, clopyralid and picloram) on total bacterial (TB) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) communities was investigated in a urea-fertilized soil microcosm using {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} at days 1 and 15 of incubation. The residual concentrations of herbicides in microcosm soils were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Differences in bacterial communities were analyzed and visualized with non-metric multidimensional scaling. All of the tested herbicides decreased in microcosm soils, reaching 46 – 98 % of dissipation at 15 days. Changes in the TB and AOB communities were variable, depending on the <b>urea</b> and <b>herbicide</b> dosage, herbicide type and sampling time. Under the recommended dose of urea (570 mg kg? 1 soil), soils that were treated with MCPA and triclopyr showed significant changes in TB and AOB community structures compared to control soils at both sampling times. When a 2 -fold-higher recommended dose of urea (1140 mg kg? 1 soil) was applied, the TB communities were mainly affected by flumetsulam and picloram at both sampling times. Changes in the AOB communities were mainly observed in soils that were treated with MCPA and fluroxypyr under both urea doses. This study determined which herbicides (and doses) significantly affect the bacterial communities in urea-fertilized soils. This evidence can be very useful when management practices are being designed, revised and/or established in Andisols...|$|R

The treatments were three SU herbicides, nicosulfuron, rimsulfuron, foramsulfuron and most commonly used herbicides in maize. Hoe weeded and unweeded treatments also were included. The {{findings of this study}} showed that at both planting patterns all plots that received nicosulfuron had significantly higher maize grain yield than other two SU herbicides. At Double Row (DR) planting pattern, all the treatments controlled weeds more effectively than at Single Row (SR) planting pattern and increased maize grain yield by mean of 1. 0 t haG 1. At both planting patterns herbicidal mixture of atrazine and alachlor was the best treatment in controlling weeds. The hoe weeded control and all herbicidal treatments had lower weed dry matter than the untreated control at crop harvest period. In addition the lowest weed dry matter was obtained from the hoe weeded control. Results of this study revealed that nicosulfuron and rimsulfuron were the best and the weakest SU herbicide at both planting patterns, respectively...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{prompted}} by increasing concerns about ecological damage and human health threats derived by persistent contamination of water and soil with herbicides, and emerging of bio-sensing technology as powerful, fast and efficient tool for the identification of such hazards. This work is aimed at overcoming principal limitations negatively affecting the whole-cell-based biosensors performance due to inadequate stability and sensitivity of the bio-recognition element. The novel bio-sensing elements {{for the detection of}} herbicides were generated exploiting the power of molecular engineering in order to improve the performance of photosynthetic complexes. The new phenotypes were produced by an in vitro directed evolution strategy targeted at the photosystem II (PSII) D 1 protein of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, using exposures to radical-generating ionizing radiation as selection pressure. These tools proved successful to identify D 1 mutations conferring enhanced stability, tolerance to free-radical-associated stress and competence for herbicide perception. Long-term stability tests of PSII performance revealed the mutants capability to deal with oxidative stress-related conditions. Furthermore, dose-response experiments indicated the strains having increased sensitivity or resistance to triazine and <b>urea</b> type <b>herbicides</b> with I 50 values ranging from 6610 28 M to 261026 M. Besides stressing the relevance of several amino acids for PSII photochemistry and herbicide sensing, the possibility to improve the specificity of whole-cell-based biosensors, vi...|$|R

40|$|Phenyl <b>urea</b> <b>{{herbicides}}</b> {{are among}} the most widely used herbicides in agriculture, resulting in important contamination of both surface water and groundwater. In this study we tried to isolate new linuron degrading bacteria and investigated whether complete linuron mineralization is commonly performed by a consortium or rather by a single primary degrader. Enrichment experiments with linuron were set up starting from two agricultural soils which had been treated previously with linuron and other pesticides. Subcultures fed with the metabolites 3, 4 -dichloroaniline (3, 4 -DCA) and N,O-dimethylhydroxylamine (N,O-DMHA) were set up from the linuron fed enrichment cultures. 16 S rDNA PCR-DGGE showed that the linuron degrading communities enriched from the two soils were different and were both complex in composition. The enrichment cultures were able to mineralize linuron efficiently as shown by 14 C-labeled linuron mineralization experiments. One linuron mineralizing strain was isolated from soil DKE. Additionally we found seven unique 3, 4 -DCA degraders in this soil (based on BOX-PCR). From soil BEH we retrieved five unique linuron degrading strains, of which three are able to mineralize linuron completely. Variovorax spp. specific FISH showed that one of these isolates belongs to this genus. In this soil three unique 3, 4 -DCA degrading strains were found. In both soils we found Hyphomicrobia which are known for their N,O-DMHA degrading capabilities (Dejonghe et al., 2003). These results show that Variovorax spp. are important linuron degrading bacteria in soil and complex environmental pollutants such as linuron are metabolized by a consortium rather than by a single pollutant mineralizing strain. status: publishe...|$|E
30|$|Substituted phenyl <b>urea</b> <b>herbicides</b> {{are most}} widely used {{pesticides}} in agriculture and aquaculture. Diuron {{has been identified as}} the third most frequently found hazardous pesticide in ground water having adverse impact on natural resources (Newman 1995). The maximum permissible concentration of diuron in drinking water in USA is 10  µg/l, and the norm is even stricter in Europe with maximum permissible limit of total pesticides and related product content in drinking water being 0.5  µg/l (Field et al. 1997; Plakas and Karabelas 2012). Conventionally, these are removed from water by activated carbon, ozonation and peroxide treatment (Agbekodo et al. 1996; Cyna et al. 2002). The presence of natural organic matter in water limits the removal efficiency of such pesticides from water by conventional methods. Moreover, stringent directives from governments and occasional high organic load in water often challenge the efficiency of these methods to meet the drinking water standard. Additional treatment adds further cost to already expensive methods (Devitt et al. 1998). In many occasions, pesticides are only partially removed after secondary and even tertiary treatment in treatment plants (Campo et al. 2013). In that way, the treatment plants were pointed out as source of pesticide contaminants. Membrane filtration has been envisaged as an alternative to these conventional water treatment methods for pesticides removal. There are several reports on use of commercial membranes capable of removing pesticides more than 90  % from water. In a recent publication pesticide removal was reported in the range of 92 – 98  % by laboratory-made reverse osmosis membrane (Mehta et al. 2015) and there is a continuous effort put by the membrane researchers to push this value to even higher level.|$|E

40|$|Diuron (3 -[3, 4 -dichlorophenyl]- 1, 1 -dimethyl <b>urea)</b> is an <b>herbicide</b> with {{carcinogenic}} {{activity in}} rats and mice, which have developed respectively urothelial and mammary gland tumors in long-term studies. Accordingly, diuron has been categorized as a "likely human carcinogen" by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency. Although the carcinogenesis-initiating activity of diuron {{has been reported}} in an early initiation-promotion mouse skin study, its genotoxic potential has been disputed. It is necessary to clarify the mode of action through which it has caused rodent neoplasia and verify its relevance to humans. Herein, two experiments were developed to verify the initiating and promoting potentials of diuron in a twenty-three-and a twenty-one-week-long mouse skin carcinogenesis protocol. In one, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) was the solvent for the herbicide; in the other, acetone was the alternative solvent in order to verify whether DMSO had inhibitory influence on a potential cutaneous carcinogenic activity. The adopted schedule for the tumor-promoting agent 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13 -acetate (TPA) resulted in skin ulcers, which demonstrates the need for careful selection of TPA dose levels and frequency of application in this model. In both studies, diuron did not exert any influence on the skin carcinogenesis process, in contrast with results already reported in the literature...|$|R
