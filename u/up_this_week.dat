Do not let yourself slump like poor Cousin Sophia. She said, when the word came, 'Ah, it {{is nothing but a}} rift in the clouds. We are <b>up</b> <b>this</b> <b>week</b> but we will be down the next.' 'Well, Sophia Crawford,' said I,--for I will never give in to her, Mrs. Dr. dear--'God himself cannot make two hills without a hollow between them, as I have heard it said, but that is no reason why we should not take the good of the hills when we are on them.' But Cousin Sophia moaned on. 'Here is the Gallipolly expedition a failure and the Grand Duke Nicholas sent off, and everyone knows the Czar of Rooshia is a pro-German and the Allies have no ammunition and Bulgaria is going against us. And the end is not yet, for England and France must be punished for their deadly sins until they repent in sackcloth and ashes.' 'I think myself,' I said, 'that they will do their repenting in khaki and trench mud, {{and it seems to me}} that the Huns should have a few sins to repent of also.' 'They are instruments in the hands of the Almighty, to purge the garner,' said Sophia. And then I got mad, Mrs. Dr. dear, and told her I did not and never would believe that the Almighty ever took such dirty instruments in hand for any purpose whatever, and that I did not consider it decent for her to be using the words of Holy Writ as glibly as she was doing in ordinary conversation. She was not, I told her, a minister or even an elder. And for the time being I squelched her, Mrs. Dr. dear. Cousin Sophia has no spirit. She is very different from her niece, Mrs. Dean Crawford over-harbour. You know the Dean Crawfords had five boys and now the new baby is another boy. All the connection and especially Dean Crawford were much disappointed because their hearts had been set on a girl; but Mrs. Dean just laughed and said, 'Everywhere I went this summer I saw the sign [...] "MEN WANTED" [...] staring me in the face. Do you think I could go and have a girl under such circumstances?' There is spirit for you, Mrs. Dr. dear. But Cousin Sophia would say the child was just so much more cannon fodder." ...|$|E

5000|$|The episode {{received}} mixed reviews, {{earning a}} 64% approval rating, {{with an average}} score of 6.6/10, on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. The critical consensus reads, [...] "Angela Bassett shines as Ramona Royale in [...] "She Wants Revenge", but her story arc feels forced {{this late in the}} season of Hotel." [...] Alex Stedman from Variety believed that [...] "the aptly titled [...] "She Wants Revenge" [...] moves the plot quickly in ways that few episodes before it have", complimenting the plotline as well as the upcoming expectations the episode enabled. Michael Calia from The Wall Street Journal commented that [...] "after getting lost in Det. John Lowe's long, strange, bloody and warped trip last time, AHS: Hotel turned its attention back to the character {{at the center of it}} all, Lady Gaga's the Countess. This week's episode, [...] "She Wants Revenge", casts the Countess as an immortal on a mission. Well, make that several missions." [...] Matt Fowler from IGN was also of the same opinion, saying, [...] "Hotel sobered <b>up</b> <b>this</b> <b>week,</b> peeling itself away from its current streak of enjoyable-but-masturbatory flashbacks to coldly remind us that the beating heart of this season is an unfathomably dull vampire story." ...|$|E

[...] Meryl Gottlieb from The Post Athens gave the episode a positive review; [...] "“Mommie Dearest” was definitely one of the best episodes of the season. Scream Queens still needs to work on finding the best balance between characters. It’s either heavily saturated with someone or that character isn’t featured at all." [...] The A.V. Club's LaToya Ferguson gave the episode C-. She said that [...] "If you’re at home, trying to solve the mystery, then this episode is a necessary one.
