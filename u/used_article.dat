5000|$|The EMS {{government}} {{was the first}} communist state government popularly elected to power in India, in the southern state of Kerala. Soon after taking its oath of office, the government introduced the controversial Land Reforms Ordinance, which was later made into an act. This, along with an Education Bill, raised a massive uproar from the landlord classes. The popular slogan for the radical socialists was [...] "the land for tillers", which sent shockwaves through the landlord classes in the country. The ordinance set an absolute ceiling {{on the amount of}} land a family could own. The tenants and hut dwellers received a claim in the excess land, on which they had worked for centuries under the feudal system. In addition, the law ensured [...] of tenure and protection from eviction. These ground-breaking measures caused the premature death of the state government, as the central government, under Jawaharlal Nehru, <b>used</b> <b>article</b> 356 to dismiss it, alleging the breakdown of law and order.

With Germany facing the Great Depression, Brüning was appointed chancellor by Hindenburg and was foreign minister shortly before Hitler came to power. Brüning {{was appointed to}} form a new, more conservative ministry on March 28, 1930, but {{did not have a}} Reichstag majority. On July 16, unable to have key points of his agenda pass parliament, Brüning <b>used</b> <b>Article</b> 48 of the Constitution governing by presidential emergency decree and dissolving the Reichstag on 18 July. New elections were set for September, in which, the Communist and Nazi representation greatly increased, hastening Germany's drift toward rightist dictatorship. Brüning backed Hindenberg over Hitler in the 1932 presidential election, but lost Hindenberg's support as Chancellor. He resigned in May of that year. According to Ventresca, Vatican Secretary of State Eugenio Pacelli was always nervous of Brüning's reliance on Social Democrats for political survival. A sentiment shared by Ludwig Kaas and many German Catholics. Ventresca wrote that Brüning never forgave Pacelli for what he saw as betrayal of Catholic political tradition and his leadership.|$|E
