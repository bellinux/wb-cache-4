The subject of insurance companies is to provide insurance protection based on commercial principles. All changes in the society are directly reflected in the insurance activity. New risks appear and therefore new insurance products appear as well. Insurance activities are divided into non-life insurance, life insurance, and in recent years increase also a share of life unit linked insurance. Yield in the form of gross written premium arises to the insurance company under insurance contracts and then must be adjusted about so called <b>unearned</b> <b>premiums.</b> The article deals with outputs of research of gross written premium in particular insurance companies in different states of Central and Eastern Europe...|$|R
40|$|Regulatory dissonance {{not only}} poses serious {{challenges}} to insurance companies seeking global expansion, but also reiterates {{the fact that}} business models cannot be exported in their entirety {{from one country to}} another. This paper presents the regulatory dissonance that exists between the non-life insurance industry in the U. S. and India. It attempts to highlight the regulatory dissonance that exists in the business line definition area, accounting treatment of acquisition expenses, treatment of <b>unearned</b> <b>premiums,</b> creation of a catastrophe reserve, reinsurance cession, investment regulation, obligations to the rural and social sector, rate and form regulation and solvency margin computation. While the paper attempts to compare most of the dissonance that exists between the two regulatory frameworks, it does not purport to be an exhaustive study of all the discrepancies that exist between the two systems. 1...|$|R

5000|$|Property premium {{is the key}} {{concept in}} the system of property-based {{economics}} developed by Gunnar Heinsohn, Otto Steiger, and Hans-Joachim Stadermann. It is an insight derived from the legal distinction between property and possession which is made by jurists, but not by economists. The distinction between property and possession is used by Heinsohn and Steiger to classify forms of society. [...] "Three distinctive systems of material reproduction are known to man: (i) custom or tribal societies, (ii) command or feudal societies and (iii) ownership- or property-based societies." [...] The first two are based on possession, which is a physical, material concept. Property, on the other hand, is an abstract, intangible concept, and thus can only exist as a creation of law and within the realm established by the rule of law. Where such a regime of law is established, property arises; and it is accompanied by the phenomenon of property premium. [...] "As soon as property is created it carries an <b>unearned</b> and immaterial <b>premium,</b> the property premium. This premium exists {{in addition to the}} physical use of goods or resources in their possessional state and consists of two powers: (i) its capacity of backing the issue of money which can be created only in a credit contract and (ii) its eligibility to serve as collateral for obtaining credit." [...] It is this property premium which explains the phenomenon of interest. The owner gives up his property premium by using his property to back the issue of that money; what he gains in exchange is interest. The borrower likewise forgoes property premium in engaging a loan, because he must back his promise of repayment with collateral, pledging his property as security for repayment of the loan. What he receives in return is liquidity premium, which is the capacity to cancel indebtedness. [...] "Keynes's idea that interest is the payment for forgoing liquidity premium, therefore, falls short. The debtor's payment of interest materializes the creditor's property premium, while the debtor's property premium gives rise to liquidity premium." ...|$|R

This approach, however, can lead to some unusual and controversial earning patterns; there are even situations where a negative premium is earned. In addition, the earning pattern for a particular loss scenario can differ materially from the earning pattern that is expected when the contract is written...|$|E
40|$|Commercial {{insurance}} companies are liable to create, {{on the basis of}} risks arising from the fulfillment of the object of their activity, technical reserves, which are used to cover liabilities arising to {{insurance companies}} from insurance and reinsurance activity. The paper focuses on the technical reserve which is, in accordance with the accounting-legal regulation, created obligatorily in commercial insurance companies – it is the <b>unearned</b> <b>premium</b> reserve. The paper explores the role and place of this technical reserve in the accounting of the commercial insurance companies based on the analysis of its substance, i. e. the objective definition. The paper is based on the methodology of the accounting, evaluation and methods of determining the amount of the technical reserve which will affect the income from operations as well as income tax base of commercial insurance companies. The paper also studied the method of reporting of <b>unearned</b> <b>premium</b> reserve in accounting according to Czech accounting legislation in comparison with International Accounting Standards (IAS/IFRS). The aim {{of this paper is to}} determine the impacts of the creation and application of the <b>unearned</b> <b>premium</b> reserve on some important items of the financial statements, which are mainly the income of operations, equity capital and balance sheet as well as to identify the impacts of different reporting of this reserve according to Czech accounting legislation and in accordance with IAS/IFRS.

40|$|In Canada, {{appointed}} actuaries {{are required}} to opine on {{the adequacy of the}} policy liabilities for property-casualty insurers. Policy liabilities include both claims and premium liabilities. Several papers have been written and actuarial techniques have been developed to estimate claims liabilities. Premium liabilities, however, have received little, virtually no attention in the actuarial literature. To date, we believe that only Canadian actuaries have been evaluating these liabilities. However, other countries are following that lead. We understand that in some states, regulators will soon require actuarial opinions on the adequacy of unearned premiums for policies with terms exceeding twelve months. The evaluation of premium liabilities consists of examining all related assets and liabilities to ensure that the anticipated net costs to discharge an insurer's obligations with respect to its insurance and reinsurance contracts, except its claim liabilities, are provided for. This paper intends to provide the practicing actuary with some guidelines on the evaluation of the premium liabilities. We will review the individual components of the premium liabilities and the related regulatory requirements and CIA recommendations. Finally, we will present an actuarial approach to evaluate the equity in the <b>unearned</b> <b>premium,</b> the <b>unearned</b> <b>premium</b> deficiency and the deferred policy acquisition expenses.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Existing actuarial {{techniques}} for automobile warranty ratemaking and reserving {{rely heavily on}} emerging experience (loss development) for the pricing and <b>unearned</b> <b>premium</b> reserving of these products. Since terms for automobile warranties can extend up to 10 years, such data is typically not available or not credible {{to the degree that}} the actuary can take great reliance on it. In addition, changing coverage terms in the auto warranty products can often make past development even less meaningful. Exposure techniques that have been developed (Cheng, 1993) rely on overall averages for some critical assumptions instead of dismbutions or individual policy characteristics. We propose a "miles-driven " approach in which claims are assumed to arise from auto warranties in proportion to the miles driven times a weight assigned to the overall mileage of the vehicle. The method we employ is much more complex than traditional methods, but relies on data that is typically available at waxranty writers. Important data dements would include the mileage of the vehicle at the time of a claim and if the contract cancels. In addition, the underlying manufacturer's warranty is also critical. In order to provide an accurate model of pricing, a distributional approach is utilized fo...|$|E
40|$|Satellite {{insurance}} liabilities for {{a portfolio of}} direct insurance contracts or facultative reinsurance contracts consist largely of <b>unearned</b> <b>premium</b> liabilities, with relatively smaller contributions from reported and unreported losses. As in life insurance, {{there is a high}} probability of loss at launch (birth),and in the early period of operation (infancy), a period of low risk of loss throughout the majority of operation, and a period of high probability of loss {{towards the end of the}} satellite's life. This paper describes the risks covered under a satellite policy and discusses the value of using a simulation model based on an active life approach to estimate the expected losses related to a satellite insurance portfolio's unearned exposure. In addition to providing an estimate of the expected losses, such a model allows for the evaluation and incorporation of the benefits from a reinsurance program protecting the portfolio. This model can also be used to estimate the anticipated benefit from reinsurance protections being considered for the portfolio and to price treaty reinsurance contracts. This paper discusses the concepts underlying the construction of such a model and describes the types of information needed to estimate the model parameters. As part of this discussion, we provide a brief history of the industry and discuss some of the hazards to which satellites are exposed...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} is an empirical study {{to ascertain the}} progress of accounting harmonisation in Chinese GAAP with the IFRS after {{the implementation of the}} latest 2006 ASBE. Three research questions are addressed and developed. The first research question aims to assess the progress of harmonisation in Chinese GAAP with IFRS. The second aims to establish whether the gap varies among different industry categories, and to further identify the industries with the most significant discrepancies between the two sets of accounting standards. The final research question seeks to identify the major items contributing to the differences in net profit and total equity figures reported under the IFRS and Chinese GAAP. The 2001 Chinese GAAP and the 2006 Chinese GAAP are evaluated against the IFRS, with the aim of providing a before-and-after comparison between the old and new Chinese GAAP. The final financial data used in this research comprises 2006 and 2007 financial reports prepared by the 47 Chinese-listed firms that simultaneously issue H- and A-shares to assess the progress of harmonisation in Chinese GAAP with IFRS. In general terms, the findings of this research indicate an improvement in the harmonisation of Chinese accounting with the IFRS after the implementation of the 2006 ASBE. Nevertheless, certain discrepancies still exist in the amount of net profit and total equity reported under the two sets of accounting standards. Furthermore, the evidence shows that the reporting of net profit and total equity discrepancies varies among different categories of industry. Insurance companies, the extractive industries, and property-leasing and development companies are identified as the industries that either contributed the largest reporting gaps, or produced the lowest comparable figures reported under the IFRS and Chinese GAAP. More specifically, the items that contributed to the discrepancies may generally being categorised based on three main causes. These are: a) the actual differences between accounting requirements under the IFRS and Chinese GAAP (treatment of policy acquisition cost and claim reserve); b) the specific requirements imposed by non-accounting Chinese regulations (treatment of policyholders’ reserve, <b>unearned</b> <b>premium</b> reserve and safety funds); and c), the options of measurement methods under the two sets of standards (methods of depreciating fixed assets, investment properties, oil and gas properties).
