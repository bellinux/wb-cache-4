5|$|The episode {{features}} the first {{appearance of the}} bowling alley Barney's Bowlarama. The original backstory for Barney's Bowlarama {{was that it was}} owned by Barney Gumble. Over time it changed to Barney just being an employee, as the writers could not imagine Barney owning anything. It was later revealed that Barney's <b>uncle</b> <b>was</b> the owner. The exterior of the Bowlarama was designed by No Doubt member Eric Stefani. The episode also marks the first appearances of Lenny Leonard and Helen Lovejoy.|$|E
5|$|After the fight, the purses {{for both}} fighters were {{withheld}} until {{video of the}} fight could be reviewed. Don King argued that Mayweather should have been disqualified because his <b>uncle</b> <b>was</b> {{the first person to}} enter the ring. At an April 13 hearing, the Nevada State Athletic Commission fined Roger Mayweather $200,000 and revoked his boxing license for one year. At a hearing on May 8, the Commission disciplined the other offenders in the melee. It fined Yoel Judah $100,000 and revoked his license for one year, fined Mayweather cornerman Leonard Ellerbe $50,000 and suspended his license for four months, and fined Zab Judah $350,000 and revoked his license for one year.|$|E
5|$|In 1111, Domnall evidently {{seized the}} kingship of the Isles by force. It is {{uncertain}} whether he enjoyed Uí Briain support in this venture. Several years later, {{at a time}} when his aforesaid <b>uncle</b> <b>was</b> gravely ill, Domnall was again active in Ireland. Although he may have openly left the Isles to take advantage of his uncle's demise, it is also possible he was forced out by the Islesmen. Domnall was slain in 1115, apparently at the hands of Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht. It is possible that he was survived by two sons.|$|E

Riley's father was an attorney, and in the year before Riley's birth, he was elected a member of the Indiana House of Representatives as a Democrat. He developed a friendship with James Whitcomb, the governor of Indiana, after whom he named his son.

5|$|Jeremi Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki {{was born}} in 1612; neither the exact date nor the place of his birth are known. His father, Michał Wiśniowiecki, of the Lithuanian-Ruthenian Wiśniowiecki family, died soon after Jeremi's birth, in 1616. His mother, Regina Mohyła (Raina Mohylanka) was a Moldavian-born noble woman of the Movilești family, {{daughter}} of the Moldavian Prince Ieremia Movilă, Jeremy's namesake; she died in 1619.

5|$|Shortly after George's {{accession}} in Hanover, the War of the Spanish Succession broke out. At {{issue was}} the right of Philip, the grandson of King Louis XIV of France, to succeed to the Spanish throne {{under the terms of}} King Charles II of Spain's will. The Holy Roman Empire, the United Dutch Provinces, England, Hanover and many other German states opposed Philip's right to succeed because they feared that the French House of Bourbon would become too powerful if it also controlled Spain. As part of the war effort, George invaded his neighbouring state, Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, which was pro-French, writing out some of the battle orders himself. The invasion succeeded with few lives lost. As a reward, the prior Hanoverian annexation of the Duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg by George's <b>uncle</b> <b>was</b> recognised by the British and Dutch.|$|E

5|$|The rebels {{launched}} the coup {{in response to}} Diệm's autocratic rule and the negative political influence of his brother Ngô Đình Nhu and his sister-in-law Madame Nhu. They also bemoaned the politicisation of the military, whereby regime loyalists {{who were members of}} the Ngô family's covert Cần Lao Party were readily promoted ahead of more competent officers who were not insiders. Đông was supported in the conspiracy by his brother-in-law Lieutenant Colonel Nguyen Trieu Hong, whose <b>uncle</b> <b>was</b> a prominent official in a minor opposition party. The main link in the coup was Đông's commanding officer Thi, whom he persuaded to join the plot.|$|E
5|$|Another local {{man called}} Tom Austin was hanged in August 1694. He {{inherited}} a farm {{with an annual}} income of £80 and then married {{the daughter of a}} neighbouring farmer with a dowry of £800. He lived an extravagant lifestyle and spent all of his money. His farm, having been neglected could not provide sufficient income for him and he borrowed a lot of money from neighbours and friends. He then turned to highway robbery and was moderately successful for a time. He shot Sir Zachary Wilmott during a robbery on the road between Wellington and Taunton. The proceeds from his crimes supported him for a time but in the long term he was unable to clear his debts. In 1694, following a row with his wife, he went to visit his uncle. His <b>uncle</b> <b>was</b> not at home and he killed his aunt and her five children and took around £60 from the house. On returning home he was asked about the bloodstains on his clothes by his wife. He then killed her and his two children. His uncle who dropped in to visit him on his way home knocked Tom Austin unconscious and he was arrested and later hung at Exeter Jail.|$|E

5|$|The anarchy in the duchy {{lasted until}} 1047, {{and control of}} the young duke was one of the {{priorities}} of those contending for power. At first, Alan of Brittany had custody of the duke, but when Alan died in either late 1039 or October 1040, Gilbert of Brionne took charge of William. Gilbert was killed within months, and another guardian, Turchetil, was also killed around the time of Gilbert's death. Yet another guardian, Osbern, was slain in the early 1040s in William's chamber while the duke slept. It was said that Walter, William's maternal <b>uncle,</b> <b>was</b> occasionally forced to hide the young duke in the houses of peasants, although this story may be an embellishment by Orderic Vitalis. The historian Eleanor Searle speculates that William was raised with the three cousins who later became important in his career– William fitzOsbern, Roger de Beaumont, and Roger of Montgomery. Although many of the Norman nobles engaged in their own private wars and feuds during William's minority, the viscounts still acknowledged the ducal government, and the ecclesiastical hierarchy was supportive of William.|$|E
5|$|The make-up for Citizen Kane {{was created}} and applied by Maurice Seiderman (1907–1989), a junior {{member of the}} RKO make-up department. Seiderman's family came to the United States from Russia in 1920, {{escaping}} persecution. As a child Seiderman had won a drawing competition and received an apprenticeship at the Moscow Art Theatre, where {{his father was a}} wigmaker and make-up artist. In New York his <b>uncle</b> <b>was</b> a theatrical scenic painter, and he helped Seiderman get into the union. He worked on Max Reinhardt's 1924 production of The Miracle and with the Yiddish Art Theatre, and he studied the human figure at the Art Students League of New York. After he moved to Los Angeles he was hired first by Max Factor and then by RKO. Seiderman had not been accepted into the union, which recognized him as only an apprentice, but RKO nevertheless used him to make up principal actors.|$|E
5|$|When his nephew, Arnold, died without issue, Salentin von Isenburg-Grenzau (1532–1610) {{resigned}} {{from the office of}} Elector (September 1577) and, in December, married Antonia Wilhelmine d'Arenburg, sister of Charles d'Ligne, Prince of Arenberg. Salentin's resignation required the election of a new archbishop and prince-elector from among the Cathedral Chapter. Two candidates emerged. Gebhard (1547–1601) was the second son of William, Truchsess of Waldburg, known as William the younger, and Johanna von Fürstenberg. He was descended from the Jacobin line of the House of Waldburg; his <b>uncle</b> <b>was</b> a cardinal, and his family had significant imperial contacts. The second candidate, Ernst of Bavaria (1554–1612), was the third son of Albert V, Duke of Bavaria. As a member of the powerful House of Wittelsbach, Ernst could marshal support from his extensive family connections throughout the Catholic houses of the empire; he also had contacts in important canonic establishments at Salzburg, Trier, Würzburg, and Münster that could exert collateral pressure.|$|E
