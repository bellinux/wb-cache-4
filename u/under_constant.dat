40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{develop a new}} {{approach}} for learning decision trees and multivariate polynomials via interpolation of multivariate polynomials. This new approach yields simple learning algorithms for multivariate polynomials and decision trees over finite fields <b>under</b> any <b>constant</b> bounded product distribution. The output hypothesis is a (single) multivariate polynomial that is an ffl-approximation of the target <b>under</b> any <b>constant</b> bounded product distribution. The new approach demonstrates the learnability of many classes <b>under</b> any <b>constant</b> bounded product distribution and using membership queries, such as j-disjoint DNF and multivariate polynomial with bounded degree over any field. The technique shows how to interpolate multivariate polynomials with bounded term size from membership queries only. This in particular gives a learning algorithm for O(logn) -depth decision tree from membership queries only and a new learning algorithm of any multivariate polynomial over sufficiently larg [...] ...|$|R
5|$|Croatian {{authorities}} launched {{initiatives to}} exhume the bodies buried at Ovčara in 1993 and 1994, {{but those were}} unsuccessful. A five-member Commission of Experts appointed by the UN Secretary General came to Ovčara to exhume the victims in October 1993. However, they were prevented from carrying out their work by the local Croatian Serb administration. After the Croatian Serb authorities blocked several attempts to further investigate the mass grave at Ovčara, still <b>under</b> <b>constant</b> guard by the Russian peacekeepers, the site was visited by then-U.S. Ambassador to the UN Madeleine Albright in January 1994.

The first known Hispanic-American Coast Guardsman to be awarded with a Bronze Star Medal was Louis Rua, whose craft, a U.S. Army large tug en route to the Philippines, went to the rescue of another ship which had been torpedoed by enemy action and helped saved 277 survivors from the abandoned ship, while serving aboard a U.S. Army large tug en route to the Philippines.|$|E

Again exposing himself to enemy fire, Valdez moved across approximately fifty yards of open ground to another Marine.

The new {{commander of the}} Canadian Corps, Julian Byng, was inspecting the Corps positions {{in front of a}} German-held rise named Mount Sorrel and noted that the Canadian troops were overlooked by German positions and <b>under</b> <b>constant</b> danger of enemy fire. The Germans also seemed to be digging new sap trenches which implied that an assault was intended. Byng ordered Mercer to make a reconnaissance of the front line and draw up a plan to overrun the more dangerous German positions in a local attack. Mercer complied on the 2 June, conducting a standard inspection of front line Canadian trenches at 08:30.|$|E
5|$|On 15 July, the {{military}} {{launched a new}} assault on Tikrit from Al-Awja. Soldiers and militiamen quickly entered the city, as militants were reportedly retreating, and seized the city's hospital. Following this, the Iraqi government was preparing to declare victory {{in the battle for}} the city. However, ISIL militants sprung an ambush, with suicide bombers reportedly leaping from windows into groups of soldiers. Government troops retreated from the city before sunset four kilometers to the south <b>under</b> <b>constant</b> mortar and sniper fire. Several security force vehicles were seen abandoned, with {{at least one of them}} burnt out. 52 soldiers and 40 militants were killed in the fighting.|$|E
5|$|Security, {{services}} and logistics {{at the reception}} centres were provided by the military component of UNTAG, {{and a number of}} secondary reception centres were also established. The movement of returnees through the centres was quick, and the repatriation programme was very successful; a UN official report stated that the psychological impact of the return of so many exiles was perceptible throughout the country. There were some problems reported in the north, where ex-Koevoet elements searched villages for SWAPO returnees; however, the UN reported that this was kept <b>under</b> <b>constant</b> surveillance by UNTAG's police monitors. By the end of the process, 42,736 Namibians had been returned from exile.|$|E
40|$|Creep {{performance}} of zinc and calcium borate-modified OSB was assessed <b>under</b> both <b>constant</b> and varying moisture conditions. The influence of initial borate content, wood species, and stress level on the creep deformation was studied. <b>Under</b> the <b>constant</b> moisture condition, there was practically {{no difference in}} creep for boards at various borate levels for both types of borate. The creep data were fitted well with a spring-dashpot model. Predicted fractional creep validated the current adjustment factor up to a 30 -year duration <b>under</b> a <b>constant</b> moisture content level. Under the varying moisture condition, large creep deflection developed due to the mechano-sorptive effect. The effect of borate on wood deformation became significant for both zinc and calcium borate OSB, indicating a reduced load carrying capacity of the OSB at higher borate levels. This result indicates the need for studying long-term duration of load properties of the modified OSB under combined mechanical and moisture loadings...|$|R
