5|$|The Internet is a {{worldwide}} network {{of computers and}} computer networks that {{communicate with each other}} <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> Protocol. Any computer on the Internet has a unique IP address that can be used by other computers to route information to it. Hence, any computer on the Internet can send a message to any other computer using its IP address. These messages carry with them the originating computer's IP address allowing for two-way communication. The Internet is thus an exchange of messages between computers.|$|E

Ninety-three percent of <b>the</b> students <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> in various frequencies. Seven percent stated {{that they do not}} know how to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> and, in this regard, the gender proportion was higher in the female students (p= 0. 026). In general, male students <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> more often than their female counterparts (p< 0. 001). Although a similar proportion of students (approximately 55 percent) <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> to retrieve information for general and dental topics, dental topics were searched in <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> less frequently. To obtain informa-tion on dental topics, students generally referred to lecture handouts or textbooks (76 percent) while 32 percent accessed <b>the</b> <b>Internet.</b> Students who <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> to obtain information on dental topics most commonly preferred the university sites (71 percent), followed by search engines by performing key word searches (47 percent).

40|$|Purpose – This study {{sought to}} {{investigate}} {{the factors that influence}} students’ intention to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> for academic purposes in Universiti Utara Malaysia. This study applies theory of planned behaviour (TPB) as the base model. The model employed the original variables from the theory i. e. attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control and intention. Method – A survey involving of questionnaires was conducted among 369 public university students. Multiple regression was employed to examine the factors influencing intention to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> for academic purposes. Findings – Results revealed that the variables attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control are statistically significant in influencing intention to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> for learning purposes. It was also found that 38 % of the variance in students’ intention to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> is cumulatively explained by their attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control. Significance – The paper provides useful scientific insight into the relationships between attitude, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control variables towards intention to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> for academic purposes.

40|$|Background: Nationally, half of {{patients}} with chronic disease <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet,</b> however {{little is known about}} what promotes or inhibits patient <b>use</b> of <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> for health information. Methods: To learn more about why patients may or may not use Internet health resources, we conducted four focus groups with patients with chronic conditions, grouped by whether or not they <b>used</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> to search for health information (2 groups users, 2 groups non-users). Patients were recruited from MU Family Medicine clinic waiting rooms, using a brief survey about Internet use. We asked patients about their <b>use</b> of <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> for personal <b>use</b> and for health information, web sites used to obtain health information, recent searches for health information, and how they used this information to impact their health. Results: Most patients surveyed did <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> for health information, including those with a chronic condition. WebMD was a commonly cited source among those who used Internet health resources. Most patients stated they <b>used</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> to look up health information because it was faster and more convenient than calling a member of their health care team. Additionally, looking up information before their visit enhanced their physician visit. The most commonly stated concerns about <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> were security and privacy. Conclusions: <b>Use</b> of <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> for health information among patients with chronic conditions is an accessory to their relationship with their physician; those with less established relationships may rely on <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> more heavily...|$|R

40|$|Orientation: Organisations {{are turning}} to <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> in search for talent. A {{constituency}} often targeted are those students {{nearing the end of}} their tenure of study who are making a transition into the working world. Given this, {{it is important to understand}} not only those factors that influence <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> within <b>the</b> Human Resources (HR) talent search process, but also how such factors relate to actual intent to apply for jobs. Research purpose: Drawing on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model, the study investigates factors that influence the adoption of <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> for purposes of job seeking. Motivation for the study: Calls have been made for research that investigates factors that influence <b>the</b> intention to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> to apply for jobs in developing countries such as South Africa. Research approach, design and method: <b>The</b> study <b>used</b> <b>the</b> quantitative approach (relying on a survey) to test the hypotheses into factors that influence <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of <b>Internet</b> for <b>the</b> purpose of job seeking amongst a sample of 346 prospective job seekers in their final year of study at a South African university. Main findings: Through correlation and regression analysis, findings reveal a positive relationship to exist between (1) performance expectancy with intention to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> to apply for jobs, (2) effort expectancy with intention to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> to apply for jobs, (3) individual effort expectancy and performance expectancy and (4) individual trust and <b>the</b> intention to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> for job seeking. However, no relationship was found to exist between facilitating conditions and intention to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> for job seeking. Practical/managerial implications: The findings magnify the role of salient factors in <b>the</b> intention to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> for job-seeking purposes. Efforts from applicants, universities, recruitment agencies and organisations, potentially, have an effect on <b>the</b> intention to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> for job-seeking purposes. Such efforts may enhance the students’ online experience and minimise problems that accompany technology adoption for the purposes of recruitment. Findings from this research may help enhance the online recruitment experience both from the end-user and recruiter perspective. Contribution/value-add: The study contributes to the recruitment literature in three ways: Firstly, UTAUT is shown to be a useful framework to explain final-year, job-seeking students’ intention to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> to apply for jobs. Furthermore, the findings illustrate the value of the UTAUT as a model useful in enhancing understanding on intentions. Secondly, the study places focus on the human factor rather than facilitating conditions as important issues regarding intention to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> to apply for a job. Finally, based on these findings, future angles of research that have academic and practitioner implications are proposed. </p...|$|R
