40|$|A flat-plate solar {{collector}} is conceived where energy cascades through thermoelectric power modules generating direct-current electricity. The intent {{of this work}} was to choose a collector configuration and to perform a steady-state thermal performance assessment. A set of energy balance equations were written and solved numerically {{for the purpose of}} optimizing collector thermal and electrical performance. The collector design involves finned columns of thermoelectric modules imbedded in the absorber plate (hot junction) over a parallel array of vertical tubes. The thermoelectric power output is limited by the small hot-junction/cold-junction temperature difference which can be maintained under steady-state conditions. The electric power per <b>unit</b> <b>tube</b> pass area is found to have a maximum as a function of a geometric parameter, while electric power is maximized with respect to an electric resistance ratio. Although the electric power efficiency is small, results indicate that there is sufficient electric power production to drive a coolant circulator, suggesting the potential for a stand-alone system...|$|E

The phase change process factors in the flow conditions and heat transfer in evaporators and condensers.

40|$|Entropy {{generation}} in adiabatic flow of highly concentrated non-Newtonian emulsions in smooth tubes of five different diameters (7. 15 – 26. 54 mm) was investigated experimentally. The emulsions were of oil-in-water type with dispersed-phase concentration (Φ) ranging from 59. 61 – 72. 21 % vol. The emulsions exhibited shear-thinning behavior {{in that the}} viscosity decreased {{with the increase in}} shear rate. The shear-stress (τ) versus shear rate (˙γ) data of emulsions could be described well by the power-law model: τ=K˙γn. The flow behavior index n was less than 1 and it decreased sharply with the increase in Φ whereas the consistency index K increased rapidly with the increase in Φ. For a given emulsion and tube diameter, the entropy generation rate per <b>unit</b> <b>tube</b> length increased linearly with the increase in the generalized Reynolds number (Re_n) on a log-log scale. For emulsions with Φ ≤ 65. 15 % vol., the entropy generation rate decreased with the increase in tube diameter.

40|$|Sea urchin adoral tube {{feet are}} highly {{specialized}} organs that {{have evolved to}} provide efficient attachment to the substratum. They consist of a disk and a stem that together form a functional <b>unit.</b> <b>Tube</b> foot disk tenacity (adhesive force per unit area) and stem mechanical properties (e. g. stiffness) vary between species but are apparently not correlated with sea urchin taxa or habitats. Moreover, ultrastructural studies of sea urchin disk epidermis pointed out differences in the internal organization of the adhesive secretory granules among species. This prompted us to look for interspecific variability {{in the composition of}} echinoid adhesive secretions, which could explain the observed variability in adhesive granule ultrastructure and disk tenacity. Antisera raised against the footprint material of Sphaerechinus granularis (S. granularis) were first used to locate the origin of adhesive footprint constituents in tube feet by taking advantage of the polyclonal character of the generated antibodies. Immunohistochemical assays showed that the antibodies specifically labeled the adhesive secretory cells of the disk epidermis in the tube feet of S. granularis. The antibodies were then used on tube foot histological sections from seven other sea urchin species to shed some light on the variability of their adhesive substances by looking for antibody cross-reactivity. Surprisingly, no labeling was observed in any of the species tested. These results indicate that unlike the adhesive secretions of asteroids, those of echinoids do not share common epitopes on their constituents and thus would be "species-specific. " In sea urchins, variations in the composition of adhesive secretions could therefore explain interspecific differences in disk tenacity and in adhesive granule ultrastructure. J.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation into}} the gas dynamics of a jet-driven vortex tube for application of a cavity nuclear reactor to rocket propulsion has shown that viscous retardation of the vortex motion is severe, because of {{a high level of}} turbulence near the periphery. Based on the experience gained in this study, it is estimated that the achievement of vortex strengths sufficient for practical application will require the use of small diameter tubes with appreciable expenditure of power for recirculation of the gas. The effect of the high degree of turbulence on the separation process near the periphery remains to be determined. The independent variables which were found to influence the vortex strength significantly for a given gas and temperature condition are the tube diameter, the mass flow rate per <b>unit</b> <b>tube</b> length, the injection velocity, and the wall pressure. Estimates of the degree of turbulence in vortex flow have been made from data on the variation in tangential velocity with radius. Virtual (total) viscosities near the periphery ranged from 30 to 700 times the molecular viscosity for tangential Reynolds numbers of from 4 x 10 /sup 4 / to 2 x l 0 /sup 6 /. Measurements of the position of the mole- fraction peak for separation of helium and a heavy vapor agreed with the theory for laminar flow. This suggests that {{near the center of the}} vortex tube where the peak developed the radial density gradient was sufficiently strong to suppress turbulence. It is concluded that the vortex reactor concept appears promising for application to nuclear rocket propulsion provided a satisfactory method can be devised for recirculation of the large excess mass flow required to maintain the vortex strength, and if turbulence does not appreciably limit the separation process. A separation experiment at elevated temperature appears to be the next logical step in the research program. (auth...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{development}} of individualized countermeasures to address problems in thermoregulation is of considerable importance for humans {{in space and}} other extreme environments. A methodology is presented for evaluating minimal/maximal heat flux from the total human body and specific body zones, and for assessing individual differences in the efficiency of heat exchange from these body areas. The goal is to apply this information {{to the design of}} individualized protective equipment. METHODS: A multi-compartment conductive plastic tubing liquid cooling/warming garment (LCWG) was developed. Inlet water temperatures of 8 - 45 degrees C were imposed sequentially to specific body areas while the remainder of the garment was maintained at 33 degrees C. RESULTS: There were significant differences in heat exchange level among body zones in both the 8 degrees and 45 degrees C temperature conditions (p < 0. 001). The greatest amount of heat was absorbed/released by the following areas: thighs (8 degrees C: - 2. 12 +/- 0. 14 kcal min(- 1); 45 degrees C: + 1. 58 +/- 0. 23); torso (8 degrees C: - 2. 12 +/- 0. 13 kcal min(- 1); 45 degrees C: + 1. 31 +/- 0. 27); calves (8 degrees C: - 1. 59 +/- 0. 26 kcal min(- 1); 45 degrees C: + 1. 53 +/- 0. 24); and forearms (8 degrees C: - 1. 67 +/- 0. 29 kcal x min(- 1); 45 degrees C: + 1. 45 +/- 0. 20). These are primarily zones with relatively large muscle mass and adipose tissue. Calculation of absorption/release heat rates standardized per <b>unit</b> <b>tube</b> length and flow rate instead of zonal surface area covered showed that there was significantly greater heat transfer in the head, hands, and feet (p < 0. 001). The areas in which there was considerable between-subject variability in rates of heat transfer and thus most informative for individual profile design were the torso, thighs, shoulders, and calves or forearms. CONCLUSIONS: The methodology developed is sensitive to individual differences in the process of heat exchange and variations in different body areas, depending on their size and tissue mass content. The design of individual thermal profiles is feasible for better comfort of astronauts on long-duration missions and personnel in other extreme environments...|$|E

METHODS: A prospective {{study was conducted in}} patients who were referred for endoscopic nasojejunal-feeding tube placement in a 950 -bed Dutch university hospital. State-of-the-art criteria for nasojejunal tube placement comprised severe gastro-oesophageal reflux, gastroparesis leading to aspiration, gastric stasis not responding to prokinetics, gastroduodenal obstruction or proximal enteric fistulae. The study endpoint was met if the feeding tube was no longer needed or had to be replaced, or if the patient was discharged from the hospital or died. RESULTS: During a four-month observation period, 131 patients were enrolled, of whom 57 % came from intensive care <b>units.</b> <b>Tube</b> placement only met {{at least one of the}} mentioned criteria in the hospital protocol in 59 % of all cases, while in intensive care patients a lower proportion was observed (50 %, p. < 0. 05).

CONCLUSION: Although directives are at hand that provide clear indications for endoscopic placement of nasojejunal feeding tubes, our data show that these guidelines are frequently not followed in clinical practice.

40|$|Since {{the thermal}} Power Plants in the Kyushu Districts {{are obliged to}} use low quality coal for fuel, they have no {{alternative}} but to utilize combustion of pulverized coal. The <b>Unit</b> System <b>Tube</b> Mill is a low costing Pulveruzer, but this system has its difficulties with automatic coal feeding. The reason being that as the feed control is carried out by interlinking the draft of the exhauster which blows the pulverized coal into the furnace with the feed rate of the coal feeder, after operation over a long period，excessive quantities of coal accumulates within the mill causing Mill- over or shortage of pulverized coal comes about decreasing the load of the Power Plant. With such difficulties constantly happening, perfect automatic combustion cannot be obtained. These defects can be corrected by disconnecting the interlink between the coal feeder and the exhauster, and controlling the feed rate of the coal feeder so that a fixed quantity of coal is constantly retained within the Tube Mill. Since a detector is necessary to determine the quantity of coal retained in the Tube Mill, the Author has invented and developed an Electro-acoustic Mill Level Meter which is quick responding and enables the operator to accurately detect the quantity of coal retained within the Mill.
