40|$|Nowadays pulps for the {{industrial}} manufacture of medium density fibre boards (MDF) are prepared {{by using the}} thermo-mechanical technique. Thermo-mechanical pulps (TMP) are mostly bonded with acid curing <b>urea</b> <b>formaldehyde</b> <b>resins</b> (UF-resins) and melamine modified <b>urea</b> <b>formaldehyde</b> <b>resins</b> (MUF-resins). During thermo-mechanical pulping wood is degraded by hydro-thermal treatment leading to formation of different chemical compounds. Evidence has been adduced that degradation products have a negative bearing on the bondability of the fibres with binders such as alkaline curing phenol formaldehyde resins (PF-resins) or polymers based on 4, 4 ´-diphenylmethandiisocyanat (PMDI) for making moisture resistant bonded boards. Results of research work {{carried out by the}} University of Göttingen, the Fraunhofer-Institute of Wood Research (WKI) in Braunschweig and the Institute of Wood Technology Dresden (IHD) have proved that chemo-thermo-mechanical pulps (CTMP) are superior to TMP on bonding with moisture resistant binders including PF-resins and PMDI binders. MDF made from CTMP pulps are of higher mechanical strength and superior hydrolysis resistance compared to boards from TMP.

It is known that the high quality plywood panel manufacturing has been achieved with a good bonding under the optimum pressure conditions depending on adhesive type. This is a study of determining the using possibilities of modern meta-heuristic hybrid artificial intelligence techniques such as IKE and AANN methods for prediction of bonding strength of plywood panels. This study has composed of two main parts as experimental and analytical. Scots pine, maritime pine and European black pine logs were used as wood species.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Urea</b> <b>formaldehyde</b> <b>resins</b> were {{formulated}} with vatiables {{of three}} reaction pHs (1. 0, 4. 8, and 8. 0 - 5. 0) and three catalysts (sodium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide/ammonium mix, and triethanolamine). The resins were prepared by placing all formaldehyde {{and water in}} reaction kettle and pH was adjusted with sulfnric acid and sodium hydroxide, respectively. Urea was added in 1. 5 equal parts at 1 - minute intervals. The proportion of high molecular weight products in the rosin increased substantially as the reaction pH decreased. The formation of {{a high percentage of}} uron derivatives under strong acidic conditions indicated these resins differed considerable from conventional UF resins formulated in the past. Bagasse panels bonded with UF resins formulated with acidic pH resulted in higher IF 3 than with those formulated with the conventional alkaline- acidic pH system. Similar results were also shown with PMDIAJF bonded Bagasse panels. The apparently higher IB strength of PMDI/UF resin systems indicate that these resin systems would be expected to provide the greatest potential for further improvement in terms of IB/cost basis. It is noted that mixed catalyst systerfLof sodium hydroxide/ammonium and triethanohunine yielded a higher average IB, while sodium hydroxide catalyst resulted in a lower IB than commercial UF resin used as control. Since the cost of UF is substantially lower than that of PMDI, economic gains of PMDI/UF resin could be significant by using UF resin as the major component in the system...|$|E

40|$|A {{technique}} {{has been developed}} to enable <b>urea</b> <b>formaldehyde</b> <b>resins</b> to be located in particle boards using Energy Dispersive Analysis of X-rays (EDAX). This method of detection requires the resin to be chemically labelled, and several possible chemicals are proposed. The merits {{of each of these}} chemicals are discussed and thiourea and chloral are selected as the best potential labels. It is necessary to ensure that adding these chemicals to a resin will not alter the resin's properties. For this reason the thiourea and chloral labelled resins' physical properties are compared with those of an unlabelled resin. The effect of cyclic soaking (in water) and drying on the physical behaviour and tensile strengths of labelled and unlabelled resin films is also assessed. As a result of these, and later experiments, chloral is rejected as a suitable label. All subsequent investigations of resin microdistribution are carried out using a thiourea/urea formaldehyde resin. These studies reveal several important characteristics of particleboard ''glue lines''. The majority of resin is concentrated close to the ''glue line'' and is rarely found more than two cells away from the chip junction. Little or no resin is observed in the cell lumen, but there is evidence of cell wall penetration and possible within cell wall distributions are identified. Finally the implications of the cycling, tensile strength and resin distribution data are discussed with reference to the problems of particleboard failure in moist environments.

40|$|Mixtures {{of metal}} salts with {{complexing}} agents, such as urea, form liquids, which {{are known as}} deep eutectic solvents (DESs). This has previously been applied to metal salts such as ZnCl₂, AlCl₃ and CrCl₃. 6 H₂O. The aim of this thesis was {{to see if this}} model could be expanded to include alkali metal salts. Some of the hydrogen bond donors (HBDs) investigated were found to form liquid mixtures with a limited number of alkali metal salts, which showed melting temperatures below 25 °C. Utilising glycerol as a HBD exhibited the highest mutual solubility with the alkali metal salts of interest, therefore this study focussed on sodium salt:glycerol mixtures. Four sodium salts were chosen: NaBr, NaOAc, NaOAc. 3 H₂O or Na₂B₄O₇. 10 H₂O, which provided a range of fluidities and contained hydrates and anhydrous salts. The ionic conductivity and viscosity of these salts with glycerol were studied, and it was found that unlike previous studies of choline chloride with glycerol where the salt decreases the viscosity of glycerol, all of the sodium salts increased the viscosity of glycerol. This suggests that sodium salts have a structure making, kosmotropic effect, rather than structure breaking, chaotropic effect, on glycerol. This phenomenon is probably due to the high charge density of Na⁺, which coordinates to the glycerol. The ion transport properties and molecular dynamics of sodium salt:glycerol mixtures have been investigated at the microscopic level using nuclear magnetic resonance and electrochemical techniques. Self-diffusion coefficients of the components of the systems of interest were found to be 10 ⁻¹¹- 10 ⁻¹³ m² s⁻¹ range. T₁ relaxation times were investigated and all systems showed a transition from a diffusion-limited, slow molecular tumbling regime to a fast molecular, high mobility, tumbling regime. Poor solubility was experienced with a range of transition metal salt probes, which was attributed to complex ion speciation. It was concluded that the sodium salt:glycerol systems studied are not ideal for electrochemical applications. The ability of the salts to form viscous gels made them ideal plasticisers for starch. Starch DES mixtures were tested as a binder for medium density fibreboard (MDF). The properties of MDF samples were tested as a function of processing conditions and composition. Pilot scale production of plasticised starch MDF composites was successful, demonstrating the current industrial infrastructure can be utilised for large-scale production at a similar cost to MDF bound with <b>urea</b> <b>formaldehyde</b> <b>resins...</b>|$|E
40|$|There {{are four}} big medium density {{fibreboard}} (MDF) plants in New Zealand {{with a total}} production capacity of close to one million cubic meters per year. A significant quantity of boards (nearly 3 % or about 30, 000 cubic meters per year) is rejected due to defects such as weak core, low modulus of rupture and elasticity, low internal bonding and delamination. The main cause of these defects, is lack of complete understanding of the inter relationship during the hot-pressing stage between the initial inputs such as temperature, moisture content, platen pressure {{and its impact on}} the properties of boards. The best solution is to develop a mathematical model to assist in understanding these relationships and to solve the equations in the model by using advanced software. This will reduce the number of expensive experiments and will enable us to see some of the parameters, which are otherwise difficult to visualise. Several earlier researchers have tried to model hot pressing of wood composites, mostly either for particle board or oriented strand board (OSB), and only a few are for MDF. The type of numerical methods used to solve the model equations and various assumptions, changes from one investigator to the other. The non-availability of source code to convert the mathematical equations into programme, is one of the reasons for this model development. To improve the productivity of MDF plants in New Zealand, there was a need to develop a computer programme which can include all the latest findings and can remove the defects which are present in earlier models. This model attempts a more complete integration than in the previous models of all the components such as heat transfer, moisture movement and vertical density profile formation in a one-dimensional model of hot pressing of MDF. One of the important features added in the heat and mass transfer part of the model is that the equilibrium moisture content (EMC) equation given for solid wood was modified to be applicable for the MDF fibres. In addition, this EMC equation can cover the complete range of hot pressing temperature from 160 ºC to 200 ºC. The changes in fibre moisture content due to bound water diffusion, which was were earlier neglected, was considered. The resin curing reactions for phenol formaldehyde and <b>urea</b> <b>formaldehyde</b> <b>resins</b> are also incorporated into the model, with the energy and water released during the curing reaction being included in the energy and mass balances. The validation of the heat and mass transfer model was done by comparing the values of core temperature and core pressure from the model and the experiments. The experimental value of core pressure and core temperature is obtained by putting a thermocouple and pressure transducer in the middle of the mat. The experimental core temperature results show qualitative agreement with the predicted results. In the beginning, the core temperatures from both experiment and model overlap each other. In the middle of the press cycle, the experimental core temperature is higher by 10 ºC and by the end the difference decreases to 5 ºC. The vertical density profile (VDP) is a critical determining factor for the strength and quality of MDF panels. The earlier concept of ratio of modulus of elasticity of the layer to the sum of modulus of elasticity of all the layers in the previous time step, given by Suo and Bowyer (1994), is refined with the latest published findings. The equation given by Carvalho et al. (2001) is used to calculate the MOE of different layers of the mat. The differential equation of a Maxwell element given by Zombori (2001) is used to measure stress, nonlinear strain function and relaxation of fibres. The model gives good agreement of peak and core density at lower platen temperature at 160 ºC but with the increase of platen temperature to 198 ºC, the rise in peak density is comparatively higher. There is a distinct increase in predicted peak density by 150 kg/m³ in comparison to the experimental result, where the increase is only by 10 kg/m³. There is a large decline (50 kg/m³) in core density in the experimental results in comparison to only a slight decline (13 kg/m³) in the predicted results. The use of Matlab provides a very convenient platform for producing graphical results. The time of computation at present is nearly 20 hrs in a personal computer with Pentium four processor and one GB RAM. The model can predict properties of a pressed board for the standard manufacturing conditions and also the new hot pressing technologies such as the use of steam injection or a cooling zone in the continuous press. A comparative study has been done to show the advantages of using new hot pressing technology. The present model will become an important tool in the hands of wood technologist, process engineers and MDF manufacturing personnel, to better understand the internal processes and to improve production and quality of MDF boards. This theoretical model helped in developing better understanding of internal processes. By using it, we can analyse the impact of platen temperature, moisture content on the core temperature, core pressure and density profile. It gives better insight into the relationship between core pressure and delamination of the board. The model is also able to predict the internal changes in the new hot pressing technologies such as the steam injection pressing and the use of a cooling zone in a continuous press. Using the simulation results, the exact time needed for the complete curing of resin can be calculated and then these results can be applied in the commercial plants. If the pressing time is reduced, then the over all production of both batch press and continuous press will increase. The second part of the project is the development of an empirical model to correlate the physical properties from the MDF board to the mean density. The empirical model is simple and straightforward, and thus can be applied in commercial operation for control and optimization. The empirical model can predict peak density, core density, and modulus of rupture, elasticity and internal bonding within the limits in which those relationships are derived. The model gives good results for thickness ranging from 10 to 13. 5 mm and density ranging from 485 kg/m³ to 718 kg/m³...|$|E

In general, the melamine-formaldehyde resin adhesives {{are very sensitive to}} small variation in PH and gelatinize to solid materials. Therefore, {{it is very important to}} observe the effect of the gelatinizastion controlling reagents to these adhesives. 　Good results have been attained with thio-urea, resorcin and hexamethylene-tetramine. In this paper the effect of thio-ures is discussed in the view of tensile strength and a new process for the production of melamine-formaldehyde resin adheesive was proposed...|$|R

The boards were fabricated {{with three}} different densities i. e. 350 kg/m 3, 450 kg/m 3 and 550 kg/m 3 at <b>urea</b> <b>formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> (UF) loadings of 8 %, 10 % and 12 % (w/w) based on the dry weight of the kenaf core particles. The fabricated boards were evaluated for its noise acoustical coefficients (NAC) by following the ASTM E 1050 - 98 standard requirements. The study revealed that boards with higher kenaf fiber loading and UF loading gave less NAC. </p...|$|R

The experiment covers {{the process of making}} particleboard with several raw material compositions and testing their physical and mechanical properties. The particleboard is bonded with <b>urea</b> <b>formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> with the dimension of 30 cm x 30 cm x 1, 5 cm,The results indicate that most of the physical properties of particleboard meet Indonesian or FAO standards, while many of mechanical properties do not meet those standards. Veneer lamination improves the bending strength and the addition of sago bark do not improve physical and mechanical properties of particleboard...|$|R
