5|$|<b>Unlike</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the nation, most of Texas {{is on its}} own {{alternating}} current power grid, the Texas Interconnection. Texas has a deregulated electric service. Texas leads the nation in total net electricity production, generating 437,236 MWh in 2014, 89% more MWh than Florida, which ranked second. As an independent nation, Texas would rank as the world's eleventh-largest producer of electricity, after South Korea, and ahead of the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The Svalbard Treaty of 1920 recognizes Norwegian sovereignty, and the 1925 Svalbard Act made Svalbard a full {{part of the}} Kingdom of Norway. The {{archipelago}} is administrated by the Governor of Svalbard, {{which is}} subordinate to the Norwegian Ministry of Justice and the Police. <b>Unlike</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> Norway (including Jan Mayen), Svalbard is a free economic zone and a demilitarized zone, and {{is not part of}} the Schengen Area nor the European Economic Area.|$|E

Adud al-Dawla then spent one year in Mosul to consolidate his power, while his army were completing the conquest of Diyar Bakr and Diyar Mudar; The important Hamdanid city of Mayyafariqin was shortly captured by them, which forced Abu Taghlib to flee to Rahba from where he tried to negotiate peace with Adud al-Dawla. <b>Unlike</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the Buyids who had held the region temporarily, Adud al-Dawla had complete control of the region {{during the rest of}} his reign.|$|E
5|$|The Carnegie Ridge is sliding under Ecuadorian land, causing coastal uplift and volcanism. The ridge's {{movement}} {{may also}} have changed the type of faulting along the coast, causing strike-slip faults (faults that move horizontally past each other). Evidence of this subduction altering the course of faulting is found at the Yaquina fault, which, <b>unlike</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the Panama Basin faults, trends to the west instead of north-south, indicating that the Carnegie Ridge may be colliding with the continental mass of Ecuador. This collision created northwest-southeast and northeast-southwest-trending faults in the region, and with that, caused strong earthquakes in Riobamba in 1797 and Alausi in 1961. Several of the northwest-southeast-trending faults converge in the Inter-Andean Valley where the 1949 Ambato earthquake took place.|$|E
5|$|The college's {{students}} {{became known}} as free spirited outsiders within the university for their different dress, apathetic demeanor, and greater interest in reading books. The college's demographics were <b>unlike</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the university, with students largely not from Wisconsin and disproportionately of Jewish and East Coast families. The college developed a reputation for radicalism and wanton anarchy, especially within Wisconsin. The students lived and worked with their teachers, called advisers, in Adams Hall, away {{from the heart of}} the university. They had no fixed schedule, no compulsory lessons, and no semesterly grades, though they read from a common syllabus. The advisers taught primarily through tutorial instead of lectures. Extracurricular groups, including philosophy, law, and theater clubs, were entirely student-led.|$|E

Cuba did not gain its independence from Spain until 1898.|$|R
50|$|Cashew turrón (Philippine Spanish: turrones de casúy; Spanish: turrones de anacardo) from Pampanga Province is a derivative.

5|$|FH {{is usually}} treated with statins. Statins act by {{inhibiting}} the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMG-CoA-reductase) in the liver. In response, the liver produces more LDL receptors, which remove circulating LDL from the blood. Statins effectively lower cholesterol and LDL levels, although sometimes add-on therapy with other drugs is required, such as bile acid sequestrants (cholestyramine or colestipol), nicotinic acid preparations or fibrates. Control of {{other risk factors}} for cardiovascular disease is required, as risk remains somewhat elevated even when cholesterol levels are controlled. Professional guidelines recommend {{that the decision to}} treat a person with FH with statins should not be based on the usual risk prediction tools (such as those derived from the Framingham Heart Study), as they are likely to underestimate the risk of cardiovascular disease; <b>unlike</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the population, FH have had high levels of cholesterol since birth, probably increasing their relative risk. Prior to the introduction of the statins, clofibrate (an older fibrate that often caused gallstones), probucol (especially in large xanthomas) and thyroxine were used to reduce LDL cholesterol levels.|$|E
5|$|In September 1941, General Douglas MacArthur {{requested}} Casey's {{services as}} his chief engineer. Casey arrived in Manila in October, {{shortly before the}} outbreak of war between the United States and Japan. He acquired construction equipment from the National Power Corporation that was being used on the Caliraya project. Casey supervised demolitions as MacArthur's troops retreated to Bataan, {{for which he was}} awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. <b>Unlike</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> MacArthur's headquarters, Casey, who was promoted to colonel on 19 December 1941 and brigadier general on 25 January 1942, did not relocate to Corregidor but remained on Bataan with a small staff of five officers. However, he joined MacArthur and sixteen other members of his staff in their escape from Corregidor by PT boat in March 1942. For his service in the 1942 campaign in the Philippines, he was awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal.|$|E
5|$|The Mackinac Bridge carries I-75 {{across the}} Straits of Mackinac that {{separate}} Michigan's Upper and Lower peninsulas; the straits also form {{the connection between}} Lakes Michigan and Huron. The structure, <b>unlike</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the state highways in Michigan like I-75, is under the maintenance {{and control of the}} Mackinac Bridge Authority (MBA). The authority collects a toll from traffic that crosses the bridge, which , is $4 for passenger cars and $5 per axle for commercial vehicles and motorhomes. In addition to cash, the MBA offers a pre-paid debit card option for the payment of tolls. The authority also provides a driver assistance program that will drive vehicles across the bridge at no additional charge; motorists who use the service have a fear of bridges. Because the bridge normally only allows motor vehicles, bicyclists and snowmobiles shuttled across are subject to fees. The authority maintains a small police department to patrol the bridge and escort vehicles across, and a pair of radio station transmitters that broadcast bridge conditions and travel information on AM530 and AM1610.|$|E

5|$|The {{second major}} American company {{to set up}} a {{manufacturing}} base in Trafford Park was the Ford Motor Company, in 1911. Initially Ford used its factory as an assembly plant for the Model T, although other vehicles were assembled there in later years, before moving to a new factory at Dagenham, Essex, in 1931. By 1915, 100American companies had moved into the park, peaking at more than 200 by 1933. When the cotton industry began to decline in the early 20th century, Trafford Park and the Manchester Ship Canal helped Manchester– {{and to a lesser extent}} the rest of south Lancashire– to weather the economic depression from which the rest of Lancashire suffered. During the First World War the park was used for the manufacture of munitions, chemicals and other materiel. Most firms at Trafford Park succeeded in avoiding bankruptcy during the Great Depression, <b>unlike</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> Lancashire. Ford moved to Dagenham in 1931, but returned temporarily to Trafford Park during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Together with a {{simultaneous}} {{attack on the}} Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, and a failed plane hijacking {{that resulted in a}} plane crash in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, the attacks resulted in the deaths of 2,996 people (2,507 civilians, 343 firefighters, 72 law enforcement officers, 55 military personnel, and the 19 hijackers). More than 90% of the workers and visitors who died in the towers had been at or above the points of impact. In the North Tower, 1,355 people at or above the point of impact were trapped, and died of smoke inhalation, fell, jumped from the tower to escape the smoke and flames, or were killed when the building eventually collapsed. One stairwell in the South Tower, Stairwell A, somehow avoided complete destruction, <b>unlike</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the building. When Flight 11 hit, all three staircases in the North Tower above the impact zone were destroyed, thus making it impossible for anyone above the impact zone to escape. 107 people below the point of impact also died.|$|E
5|$|Farmwork {{combined}} with lessons {{from his mother}} — such was the order of Jan's life {{for the next few}} years. During his early childhood, still too young to be given formal responsibilities on the farm, Jan accompanied the Coloured farm labourers as they went about their daily work. At this time the relations between master and servant, between black and white, were certainly not based on social equality; nevertheless, on these Swartland farms there was little of the rigid segregation which was already emerging elsewhere in South Africa and which was later to have such profound consequences. Since 1828 the Cape had enshrined in law the principle of strict legal equality between the races. <b>Unlike</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> South Africa, all adult males, were entitled to vote and to stand for election to the Colonial legislature, subject only to a property qualification. In these country districts therefore, there existed a certain intimacy between the farm owners and their labourers. At harvest times it was common to find both working together to gather in the crops and it was also commonplace to find the farm's children playing with one another, irrespective of race.|$|E
