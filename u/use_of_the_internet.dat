40|$|Given its {{transnational}} character <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> {{is often}} {{perceived as a}} technology that will challenge <b>the</b> frontiers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation-state.

More empirically grounded research - that moves beyond the utopian/dystopian, online/offline and virtual/real dichotomies - is important to grasp such contradictory <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet.</b> Studies located outside the U.

5|$|Blood-C: The Last Dark, {{which follows}} {{the events of}} Blood-C, {{is set in a}} version of Earth where humans are preyed upon by monsters called Elder Bairns; to keep humans safe, the Elder Bairns honor a {{covenant}} dubbed Shrovetide, a contract between humans and Elder Bairns that allows Elder Bairns to feed on humans for a limited period of time. During the events of Blood-C, Saya Kisaragi fights Elder Bairns attacking her village. It is eventually revealed that Saya is an Elder Bairn barred from drinking human blood by an oath—captured by Fumito Nanahara, head of the organization that supervises Shrovetide, she entered a wager in which she would subject herself to an experiment, with her prize being the reneging of her oath. The experiment fails, and everyone involved is massacred aside from Fumito, his ally Yūka Amino, and Saya herself. Betrayed by Fumito, Saya swears vengeance against him. By the events of The Last Dark, Fumito—operating through his covert group Tower and its puppet corporation Seventh Heaven—has gained control of Tokyo's government and implemented the Youth Ordinance Bill, a law which enforces curfews for minors and regulates the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>internet.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Singaporean anime {{community}} considered Odex's {{actions to}} be controversial, sudden, and heavy-handed—especially {{when it was}} discovered that the youngest person threatened was nine years old. In response, Odex dropped its pay-or-be-sued letter approach in favour of cease-and-desist emails to downloaders. Odex halted active enforcement after its third subpoena was rejected by the courts and lost a lawsuit when trying to obtain customer data from another ISP. In January 2008, Odex appealed the decision, and the High Court of Singapore ruled that one ISP was required to release data, but only directly to Japanese anime studios. Subsequently, these studios started their own legal actions against Singaporean downloaders. Some observers predicted that the High Court's decision would set a precedent for online privacy in Singapore by making it more difficult for copyright licensees to take legal action against downloading. The case raised issues of individual privacy, intellectual property, and free <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet.</b> Odex's actions attracted widespread criticism in Singapore and international attention and press coverage, which coincided with similar actions against consumer file sharing of music in the United States.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how Internet use relates to social capital and its outcomes- civic and political engagement. This topic has received much attention recently, but <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> social capital needs clarification to enhance <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> empirical examinations. I use Coleman’s (1988) original formulation of social capital, which has three components: obligations, expectations and trustworthiness of structures; information channels; and norms and effective sanctions. Subsequent iterations of Coleman’s definition, such as Putnam’s (1993, 2000) work, have ignored the information channel component of social capital. This component, I argue, {{is critical to}} defining social capital and to understanding how <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> could affect social capital and its outcomes. <b>The</b> <b>Internet</b> is a important mechanism of information gathering and information flow. Thus, it can be critical to <b>the</b> functioning <b>of</b> social capital as an information channel. Using the Canadian General Social Survey- Cycle 14 (2000), I test a causal model that {{examines how}} Internet use relates to trust as well as civic and political engagement. Internet use, particularly informational <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet,</b> helps to predict political engagement. I compare Internet users and non-users, as well as general Internet use and informational <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> to more fully illustrate <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> in social capital and its outcomes- civic and political engagement. When comparing the various models, I find that <b>the</b> direct impact <b>of</b> education on political engagement is greatly diminished by introducing informational <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> to <b>the</b> model predicting engagement. I argue that by enabling the information channel component of social capital, Internet use can reduce <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> education, which can expand levels of civic and political engagement in the population...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine how}} people’s {{different}} <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> predict their later scores {{on a standard}} measure of depression, and how their existing social resources moderate these effects. In a longitudinal US survey conducted in 2001 and 2002, almost all respondents reported using <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> for information, and entertainment and escape; these <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> had no impact on changes in respondents’ level of depression. Almost all respondents also used <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> for communicating with friends and family, and they showed lower depression scores six months later. Only about 20 percent of this sample reported using <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> to meet new people and talk in online groups. Doing so changed their depression scores depending on their initial levels of social support. Those having high or medium levels of social support showed higher depression scores; those {{with low levels of}} social support did not experience these increases in depression. Our results suggest that individual differences in social resources and people’s choices <b>of</b> how they <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> may account for the different outcomes reported in the literature...|$|R
40|$|Ecological {{systems theory}} assumes that child {{development}} is <b>the</b> consequence <b>of</b> ongoing reciprocal and spiraling {{interactions between the}} child and his/her microsystem (immediate home, school, and community environments). <b>The</b> increasing presence <b>of</b> digital technologies in children’s immediate environments suggests {{the need for the}} proposed theoretical techno-microsystem. The ecological techno-microsystem situates the developing child in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>use</b> in home, school, and community environments. Preliminary validation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ecological techno-microsystem requires description <b>of</b> children’s <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> across three environments and comprehensive measures of child development. Ninety-one children (37 males and 54 females; mean age 10. 7 years) completed rating scales <b>of</b> their Internet <b>use.</b> Additionally, parents and teachers completed rating scales of child social, emotional, physical, and cognitive development. Significant correlations between specific <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> in specific contexts and specific measures of child development support <b>the</b> theoretical utility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ecological techno-microsystem. <b>The</b> developmental consequences <b>of</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>use</b> varied as a function <b>of</b> elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> microsystem (e. g., home and school characteristics) and elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> technology (e. g., instant messaging versus email) ...|$|R
