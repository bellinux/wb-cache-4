Analysis of different approaches to defining the term «innovation potential» for industrial enterprises has been carried out; resource-based, resultative, integrative and capacitive approaches have been highlighted, the latter one based on assessment of enterprise capacities. A conclusion has been made regarding advantages of integrative approach. Research has been made on the role of industry in the fuel and power sector of China and dynamics of industry and enterprise development in Shanxi province. Basing on suggested approach a system of assessment principles has been formulated, taking into account specific features of coal industry enterprises. Complex of indicators to assess <b>innovation</b> <b>potential</b> has been developed using expert evaluation method. An expertise procedure is proposed to assess competence of experts; results obtained from the expertise are presented. Proposed complex of indicators includes 23 parameters combined into three groups. Testing of proposed complex of indicators has been carried out on the example of coal industry in Shanxi province (China). Application of all stated principles has been proved in the process of indicator selection, assessment and formulation of recommendations for subsequent <b>innovation</b> <b>potential</b> management of coal industry enterprises.

40|$|The {{relevance}} {{of the study is}} due to the especially sharp of late issue of the competition in world markets, which requires strengthening of innovation component from the economy of any country, including Ukraine. Ukrainian enterprises with innovation activity are able to maintain high growth rate in the long term. The main component in the effectiveness and efficiency of carrying out innovative processes at an enterprise is its <b>innovation</b> <b>potential,</b> including professional staff that is quite difficult to estimate given the rapid changes of the fulfilled tasks. The purpose of writing this article is the analysis of existing approaches to the evaluation of the innovative potential of enterprises and their improvement taking into account the peculiarities of service enterprises, the formulation of the task of innovation management and the main directions of development of <b>innovation</b> <b>potential</b> of an enterprise. We applied system approach, methods of analysis and synthesis and the method of modeling when carrying out research. The task of innovation management of an enterprise was formulated. A methodological approach to the evaluation of the <b>innovation</b> <b>potential</b> of enterprises in the sphere of services is attached. This approach will allow the heads of the enterprises in the sphere of services to monitor creativity and collective intelligence of the employees, to assess an enterprise on innovation and make timely decisions to eliminate the deficiencies. It was stressed that special measurements, quantitative evaluation of the intellectual, professional, educational, and other qualitative characteristics of the potential of employees is quite a difficult task, to perform which the expert methods are used based on interviews, surveys of executives, business owners and prominent managers. The main directions of stimulating the development of the <b>innovation</b> <b>potential</b> of an enterprise were formulated. A conclusion was made that under current conditions, in the absence of perfect methods of evaluation of <b>innovation</b> <b>potential</b> of the services industry, review and comprehensive application of different methods proposed in economic literature will allow obtaining more reliable information for justified management decision–making regarding the management of the <b>innovation</b> <b>potential</b> of an enterprise, introducing relevant changes into the components of the <b>innovation</b> <b>potential</b> to ensure its adequacy to the set innovation goals and increasing a general level of competitiveness in the given industry and in the global market as a whole. The scientific novelty of the research lies in improving the methodological approach to the evaluation of the <b>innovation</b> <b>potential</b> of an enterprise {{on the basis of the}} complex of main indicators specific to services and consideration, during the evaluation of personnel, of the <b>innovation</b> <b>potential</b> of an enterprise. The proposed approach allows analyzing the level of <b>innovation</b> <b>potential</b> of enterprises in the different spheres of activity: production, services, state government, commercial and others, where the <b>innovation</b> <b>potential</b> acts not only as a set of available and adequately allocated resources, but also as approved management decision or immaterial object.

40|$|Each {{organization}} as a socio-economic system {{is exposed to}} the factors of external and internal environment; the organizational culture (OC) of the company is in its turn {{the product of the}} interrelation between the external and internal environment of an enterprise, so any impact will determine further formation and development of OC. The factors of both external and internal environment can have a positive or negative trend to a change. The problems of the research into the essence of OC and the <b>innovation</b> <b>potential</b> are tackled in many papers of both domestic and foreign authors, but no relationship was identified between the structure and the factors of OC and <b>innovation</b> <b>potential.</b> Therefore, in our opinion, the issue of identifying the factors influence presents a problem. Its defining will make it possible to forecast a positive or a negative trend in the change of the organizational structure that will determine the capacity to enhance the <b>innovation</b> <b>potential</b> of an enterprise. The purpose of writing this article was to study the influence of factors of external and internal environment of the organization on the components of OC and the <b>innovation</b> <b>potential</b> of an enterprise. To explore the problems studied for the article we structured in detail the concepts and elements that OC contains, and also defined the structure of the <b>innovation</b> <b>potential,</b> its components. Comparison of the structures of OC and <b>innovation</b> <b>potential</b> demonstrated the presence of common and interrelated elements. A deeper analysis was conducted by defining the main factors of OC. The results of the analysis allowed determining the place of OC {{in the structure of the}} <b>innovation</b> <b>potential</b> of an enterprise. Thus, the following conclusions can be made. First, the structure of OC and the <b>innovation</b> <b>potential</b> contains a shared item, which is microclimate that implies conditions that can facilitate the development of innovation in the organization. Second, the factors of OC for the most part form the structure of the innovation potential: personality of the founder – management style, system of communication; the size of the organization determines its structure, the presence of various technological premises, the possibility of free movement of the personnel and organization of work. Third, production technology, adopted by the organization, determines the level of its <b>innovation</b> <b>potential.</b> The flexibility of OC allows more intensive using and adapting innovation technologies at an enterprise. The scientific novelty of the research. For the first time we formulated a definition of OC as a model of key elements, genuinely correct and the one that is passed on to the new members of the team as a certain dogma. The practical value of the work lies in summarizing and comparing the basic elements of OC and the <b>innovation</b> <b>potential</b> and identifying common peculiarities that makes it possible to define the role of formation and development of organizational culture in improving the innovation of an enterprise.

The stimulation of <b>innovation</b> <b>potentials</b> within a region {{is becoming more and more}} decisive in the competition between regions. Although a precise definition of the term <b>innovation</b> <b>potential</b> is difficult, there is no doubt that it is essentially the stock of knowledge and its use which makes up the <b>innovation</b> <b>potential</b> of a region. This stock, however, is an inert factor. Its conversion into innovation underlines the importance of linkages and relationships in everyday innovation processes. Firms pursue co-operative agreements in order to gain rapid access to new technologies or new markets, to benefit from economies of scale in joint R&D and production to tap into essential resources of know-how and to share risks. These linkages possess a number of features which make the network mode a distinct from inter-firm organisation. This paper attempts to give a clear documentation of current innovation activities in the metropolitan region of Barcelone between the three major actors in innovations systems: industrial firms, producer services and research institutions. The presented results are based on representative surveys within an international comparative study in three major metropolitan areas in Europe (Barcelone, Stockholm and Vienna). The results of this research will be relevant for an understanding of how and why different industries build cooperative relationships in metropolitan regions. The results will also provide insights for policy efforts that can help to nurture and expand the regional economic base in the face of the current rapid globalisation of production.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the issue of <b>potential</b> for <b>innovation</b> in small and mid-sized business environments. Innovation is becoming ever more important as it helps businesses to stay competitive in the global economy. The same applies in this era of economic crisis. Innovation is very trendy, but huge sums spent on innovation, no matter how high, do not guarantee that it will be spent effectively. As a result, innovation must be deliberate and targeted. It assumes that a company knows its overall <b>innovation</b> <b>potential</b> and is capable of enhancing it if necessary. This dissertation proceeds within the aforementioned context. It begins with a comprehensive theory and definition of essential terms. This abstract of domestic and foreign bibliography reflects historic and contemporary notions related to innovation. The theoretical part is followed by the analysis of {{the current state of the}} issue from the perspective of small and mid-sized companies in the Czech Republic. The analysis consists in a modified research by the Czech Statistical Office and in my own primary questionnaire survey. The output of the aforementioned research consists in finding of weaknesses in the <b>innovation</b> <b>potential</b> of companies and acquiring of relevant data for corroboration or refutation of postulated hypotheses, based on partial goals of this paper. The next chapter proposes a model for the calculation of the summary corporate <b>innovation</b> <b>potential</b> index, whose aim is to find weaknesses in the company without having to carry out complex comparisons through long-term research.

With regard to the gradual globalization of the world economy, {{it is obvious that}} the strategic objectives of every country are directed to own economic wealth which is lead especially by the small and medium-sized enterprises. Due to the fact that these business entities are creating the most of economic growth of every country, the necessity of research, support and development of their <b>innovation</b> <b>potential</b> is obvious. The last and also the least that one could starve for is the building up the barriers to innovativeness of domestic companies, and to decrease competitiveness of the country.
