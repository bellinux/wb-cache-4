Viewing layers as providing or consuming a service is a method of abstraction to isolate upper layer protocols from the details of transmitting bits over, for example, Ethernet and collision detection, while the lower layers avoid having to {{know the details of}} each and every application and its protocol.|$|E
25|$|The log-logistic {{has been}} used as a model for the period of time {{beginning}} when some data leaves a software <b>user</b> <b>application</b> in a computer and the response is received by the same application after travelling through and being processed by other computers, applications, and network segments, most or all of them without hard real-time guarantees (for example, when an application is displaying data coming from a remote sensor connected to the Internet). It has been shown to be a more accurate probabilistic model for that than the log-normal distribution or others, as long as abrupt changes of regime in the sequences of those times are properly detected.|$|E
500|$|Reserved code {{elements}} are codes {{which have become}} obsolete, or are {{required in order to}} enable a particular <b>user</b> <b>application</b> of the standard but do not qualify for inclusion in ISO 3166-1. To avoid transitional application problems and to aid users who require specific additional {{code elements}} for the functioning of their coding systems, the ISO 3166/MA, when justified, reserves these codes which it undertakes not to use for other than specified purposes during a limited or indeterminate period of time. Codes are usually reserved for former countries, overseas territories, international organizations, and special nationality status. The reserved alpha-2 and alpha-3 codes can be divided into the following four categories (click on the links for the reserved codes of each category): ...|$|E

40|$|The partial {{reconfiguration}} {{feature of}} some of the currentgeneration Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) can improve dependability by detecting and correcting errors in onchip configuration data. Such an error recovery process can be executed online with minimal interference of <b>user</b> <b>applications.</b> However, because Look-up Tables (LUTs) in Configurable Logic Blocks (CLBs) of FPGAs can also implement memory modules for <b>user</b> <b>applications,</b> a memory coherence issue arises such that memory contents in <b>user</b> <b>applications</b> may be altered by the online configuration data recovery process. In this paper, we investigate this memory coherence problem and propose a memory coherence technique that does not impose extra constraints on the placement of memory-configured LUTs. Theoretical analyses and simulation results show that the proposed technique guarantees the memory coherence with a very small (on the order of 0. 1 %) execution time overhead in <b>user</b> <b>applications...</b>|$|R
