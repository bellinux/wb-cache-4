40|$|We {{develop and}} test an {{integrative}} model explaining why victims of workplace social <b>undermining</b> become perpetrators of <b>undermining.</b> Conceptualizing social <b>undermining</b> as a norm-violating and a resource-depleting experience, we theorize that <b>undermining</b> victimization lowers interpersonal justice perceptions and depletes self-regulatory resources, and these 2 mechanisms in tandem trigger a moral disengagement process that influences subsequent <b>undermining</b> behaviors. We further theorize that moral identity {{functions as a}} boundary condition: high moral identity attenuates whether interpersonal injustice and resource depletion shape moral disengagement and whether moral disengagement translates to subsequent <b>undermining.</b> A field study of bank employees provides empirical support for the mediating mechanisms, and shows that employees who have high moral identity {{are less likely to}} respond to interpersonal injustice by morally disengaging and to translate moral disengagement to <b>undermining...</b>|$|R
50|$|Research {{has shown}} that {{partners}} that offer social support can also offer social <b>undermining.</b> An {{example of this is}} when family members try to <b>undermine</b> parenting styles in order to raise healthy children.

40|$|This {{investigation}} explored how parent personality, {{division of}} labor, maternal gatekeeping, and child temperament predicted <b>undermining</b> coparenting. Parent characteristics were assessed {{during the third}} trimester of pregnancy. Parent and child characteristics were assessed at 3 months and at 1 year. <b>Undermining</b> coparenting was observed at 3 years. Couples in which fathers were higher on negative affect or higher on positive affect displayed more <b>undermining</b> coparenting. Families showed greater <b>undermining</b> coparenting if they divided household and child care tasks unevenly and perceived their child as difficult. Mothers??? encouragement of father involvement was associated with less <b>undermining</b> coparenting if parents perceived their child as difficult. There was a significant interaction between fathers??? depressive symptoms and child difficult temperament; couples who perceived their child as more difficult and in which fathers reported experiencing more depressive symptoms later exhibited higher levels of <b>undermining</b> coparenting. In general, child difficult temperament was {{not directly related to}} <b>undermining</b> coparenting, but moderated the association between other predictors and <b>undermining</b> coparenting. This study points to the need for further research into the role parents??? and children???s characteristic play in influencing coparenting quality...|$|R

50|$|Social <b>undermining</b> {{has been}} very {{effective}} in the workplace. Various aspects of social <b>undermining</b> have affected the workplace and specific races. In workplaces, social <b>undermining</b> has connection with social interaction.

5|$|At {{the start}} of the siege, Gibraltar was garrisoned by around 2,000 Dutch, English, Austrian and pro-Habsburg Spanish troops facing a besieging force of up to 8,000 French, pro-Bourbon Spanish and Irish troops. The {{defenders}} were able to hold off the numerically superior besieging force through exploiting Gibraltar's geography and the small town's fortifications, though they were frequently short of manpower and ammunition. The besiegers were <b>undermined</b> by disputes between the French and Spanish officers and terrible conditions in their trenches and bastions, which led to outbreaks of epidemic disease and <b>undermined</b> morale. Sea power proved crucial, as the French navy sought unsuccessfully to prevent the Grand Alliance shipping in fresh troops, ammunition and food. Three naval battles were fought during the siege, two of which were clear defeats for the French and the last of which resulted in the siege being abandoned as hopeless after nine months of fruitless shelling. The outcome was disastrous for the French and Bourbon Spanish side, which was said to have lost 10,000 men against only 400 for the Grand Alliance.|$|E

40|$|A {{sample of}} 171 {{participants}} (94 unemployed and 77 underemployed) was administered scales tapping social support, social <b>undermining,</b> coping and psychological distress. It was hypothesised (a) that the unemployed would exhibit less social support, but more social <b>undermining</b> and psychological distress than the underemployed group; (b) that females would report more social support but less social <b>undermining</b> than males; and (c) that social support {{would be a}} better predictor of coping than social <b>undermining,</b> but that social <b>undermining</b> {{would be a better}} predictor of psychological distress than social support. It was found that the unemployed reported less social support, more psychological distress and less problem-focused coping than the underemployed. Males reported less social support but more emotion-focused coping than females. Social support was a significant individual predictor for both psychological distress and rational/cognitive coping, but not of self-care coping. No group or gender differences were identified for social <b>undermining,</b> and social <b>undermining</b> was not a significant predictor of psychological distress or coping.

50|$|Another {{example of}} how social <b>undermining</b> can affect a person's {{relationship}} is shown by {{a study conducted by}} McCaskill and Lakey which examined social support and social <b>undermining</b> when it came to adolescents and family relationships. Social support and social <b>undermining</b> can reflect different characteristics in the environment that can influence a person's mental health. The study examined how adolescents reported their family support and <b>undermining</b> which reflected shared social reality (that is, all members of the family agree that support or <b>undermining</b> is occurring) and idiosyncratic perception (some family members believe that support or <b>undermining</b> has occurred, but others do not). The results of the study found that girls tend to report higher family stress and negative affect than boys. McCaskill and Lakey (2002) found that adolescents with previous outpatient treatment experience reported both lower family support and higher family stress.|$|R

50|$|Social <b>undermining</b> {{and social}} support can have {{opposite}} effects on a person that can be negative or positive depending on the person or even the relationship. Being in a close relationship can provide a person both social <b>undermining</b> {{and social support}}. Example of these relationships can be an abusive relationship that offers low support and high <b>undermining.</b> A typical healthy close relationship has high support and low <b>undermining.</b> In a relationship between an adolescent and a parent, their relationship can offer high levels of support and even <b>undermining.</b> Depending on the relationship, patterns can change over time based on the characteristics and {{the situation of the}} relationship. Whether a relationship is positive or negative can have devastating effects.|$|R
5000|$|Vinokur and van Ryn used {{unemployed}} {{participants and}} some of the participants were reemployed to look at the impact that social support and social <b>undermining</b> can have on a person's mental health during economic hardships. They suggest that although the support and <b>undermining</b> are inversely and strongly correlated they do not form the same factor but constitute empirically distinct constructs. The study looked at the effect of financial strain, social support, and <b>undermining</b> on poor mental health the results found that it was not statistically significant. Social support and social <b>undermining</b> did have significant but the opposite effect on poor mental health. Vinokur and Ryn(1993) [...] found that social support and <b>undermining</b> were shown in longitudinal design even when prior levels of mental health and the contribution of another critical stressful factor. Social support and <b>undermining</b> had a dynamic pattern influence on mental health.|$|R
50|$|Market, Stanforth, and Garcia {{found that}} social <b>undermining</b> used by family members, friends and {{coworkers}} can affect daily activities. Social <b>undermining</b> can affect exercise routines when their exercise routines can conflict with seeing friends or even coworkers. Friends and coworkers {{can influence the}} person to skip their exercise, even when a spouse is concerned about their well being. The study also showed that social <b>undermining</b> can affect men and women differently. Men tend {{to feel as if}} they can overcome social <b>undermining</b> because they were still able to make a healthy eating decision. Women have stated that they tend to make bad eating decision when they are eating with other people such as their friends. Social <b>undermining</b> pressures can cause serious challenges when a person is trying to maintain healthy eating and trying to stay active. The study found that people that engage in <b>undermining</b> behavior tend to feel guilty about their own unhealthy behavior and may feel jealous of someone else maintaining their healthy behavior when they cannot achieve the same behavior. The study also suggests when a person is satisfied with their weight it can help the person resist against social <b>undermining.</b> By being satisfied with one's own weight can reduce the likelihood of social <b>undermining</b> in social situations when having dinner with friends. So when a person is not satisfied with their weight they receive more social <b>undermining</b> pressures from the people around them.|$|R

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. May 2010. Major: Human Resources and Industrial Relations. Advisor: Michelle K. Duffy. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF) : ix, 147 pages, appendices I-II. Ill. (some tables) In organizations, social networks (e. g., friendship and communication) not only facilitate individual communication in an organizational landscape but also are salient arenas where individuals influence one another when they determine work-related attitudes and behaviors. In this thesis, I argue that organizational friendship and communication networks can function in unwanted ways that foster (rather than inhibit) social influence among organizational members {{to engage in}} social <b>undermining</b> behaviors. I integrate the network theory of social influence into extant work on social influence of <b>undermining</b> behaviors {{in the workplace and}} propose that (1) network peers influence individuals' social <b>undermining</b> such that level of network peer <b>undermining</b> is positively related to individual <b>undermining</b> and (2) contextual characteristics (behavioral and structural characteristics of social networks) and personality traits (self-monitoring and core self-evaluation) further condition the network peer influence. In addition, I articulate three network-based proximity influence mechanisms [...] direct contact, group cohesion, and structural equivalence [...] whereby network peers influence individuals' <b>undermining</b> behaviors. I did not find support for the relationship between level of network peer <b>undermining</b> and individual undermining; but the relationship is found to be contingent on the contextual characteristics and personality traits. I also found that the three influence mechanisms contribute to similarity on <b>undermining</b> among organizational members. I discuss the implications as well as limitations and future directions of this thesis...|$|R
