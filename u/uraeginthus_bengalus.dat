The slides were examined for the presence of Plasmodium parasite (parasitaemia value). Birds examined were six Columbidae livia (pigeons), two Cisticola cantans (Singing cisticola), two Crinifer piscato (Western grey plantain eaters), two Lamprotornis superbus (Buffalo weavers), five Stigmatopelia senegalensis (Laughing doves), twenty-six Ploceus cucullatus (Black-headed weavers), forty-three Amadina fasciata (Cut-throat finches), five Lamprotoni caudatus (Long-tailed glossy starlings), twenty-four <b>Uraeginthus</b> <b>bengalus</b> (Cordon bleu finches), fifty poultry chickens, forty-six local chickens (Gallus gallus), three Nigrita Spp (Negro finches) and four Streptopchia decipiens (African mourning doves). Results of the investigation showed that Plasmodium circumflexicum, Haemoproteus columbae and Plasmodium gallinaecium were present. The frequencies of occurrence in the birds ’ species were: 19. 56 % for local chickens, 50 % for pigeons, 13. 95 % for Cut-throat finches, 50 % for Grey plantain eaters, 33. 3 % for Negro finches and 0 % for other birds. Overall, 6. 89 % of all the wild birds screened were infected as against 11. 7 % in domesticated birds. Domesticated birds had higher parasetaemia value (100 to 1000) cells per field than the wild birds (10 to 100) cells per field. However...|$|E
