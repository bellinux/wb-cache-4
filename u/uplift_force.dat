40|$|In {{the state}} of Florida {{one of the primary}} factors which {{influences}} design of structures is the effect of hurricane force winds on structures. These forces can be greater than any other force encountered throughout the lifetime of said structure. For this reason, designing a structure to resist such forces can greatly increase the cost and time required for completing construction projects. Traditionally, large concrete footings have been utilized to resist wind-induced <b>uplift</b> <b>forces.</b> These footings do little more than act as large reaction masses to weigh down the building. An alternative and little-used method for resisting these large <b>uplift</b> <b>forces</b> is the use of mini-pile anchors. Mini-pile anchors generate side shear at the interface between the pile and the soil which resists the <b>uplift</b> <b>forces.</b> This thesis provides an overview of the design methods used to estimate wind-induced <b>uplift</b> <b>forces</b> and several foundation options used to withstand these forces. More traditional/less complicated foundations are compared to the more sophisticated mini-pile method which makes more efficient use of construction materials. The cost efficiency of each method is evaluated which provides a guideline for where and when a given foundation option is appropriate. Finally, a case study where the new method was used is presented which documents the design and construction procedures...|$|R

Typically, these instabilities occur due to under-pressure development (<b>uplift</b> <b>force),</b> gradual inner degradation of foundation material (piping) or sand boil phenomenon. Thus, it seems necessary {{to calculate the}} pressure applied to the contact surface of the dam.

For such analysis, statistical descriptions of the loads and resistances are necessary. Uplift pressure has a large impact on safety, and is difficult to quantify. This paper describes the methodology of a geostatistical approach to simulate the uplift pressure, and an example is given of the results. In ‘Geostatistical approach for statistical description of uplift pressures: Part II’, these results are described in more detail. In the approach used, simulation of the hydraulic conductivity beneath the concrete dam (2 D) was performed by means of geostatistics. The spatial dependence was described using a variogram, and input data was the mean value, and variance, of the hydraulic conductivity and spatial range. For a given field of hydraulic conductivity a finite element model could be used to derive the uplift pressure, <b>uplift</b> <b>force</b> and uplift moment. Since the variance and spatial range was unknown, a thorough sensitivity analysis was performed by analyzing twenty-nine combinations of variance and range. For each combination, 1000 realizations of random fields of the hydraulic conductivity were derived, and the uplift was found for each. The resulting histograms for <b>uplift</b> <b>force</b> and uplift moment were best fitted to a Beta distribution.

However, the difference between the method proposed by Kweon et al. (2011), and the wave force measured at a different time without a phase difference, have not yet been clearly analyzed. In this study, such difference according to the method of estimating the wave force was analyzed, by measuring the wave pressure acting on a breakwater model. The hydraulic model test was conducted in a two-dimensional wave flume of 60. 0 m length, 1. 5 m height and 1. 0 m width. The steepness range of the selected waves is 0. 01 ~ 0. 03, with regular and random signals. 20 pressure gauges were used for the measurement. The analysis results showed that the wave force estimate in the method of Kweon et al. (2011) was smaller than the wave force calculated from the maximum pressure at individual points, under a random wave action. Meanwhile, the method of Goda (1974) that was applied to the horizontal plate produced a smaller wave force, than the method of Kweon et al. (2011). The method of Kweon (2011) was already verified in the real sea test of Kweon et al. (2012), where the safety factor of the pile <b>uplift</b> <b>force</b> was found to be greater than 2. 0.

The aim {{of this article is to}} explore the impact of a high-speed train passing through a tunnel on the pantograph aerodynamics and the dynamic behavior of the pantograph–catenary interaction. The aerodynamic forces acting on the pantograph are investigated thoroughly by extensive numerical simulations as well as systematic field tests. To investigate the effects of the aerodynamic forces of pantograph on the quality of current collection, the numerical simulations of the pantograph–catenary dynamic interaction are conducted with our proposed model, taking into consideration the action of the aerodynamic <b>uplift</b> <b>forces</b> obtained by the numerical simulations on the pantograph.

The results reveal that compared with the open air scenarios, the aerodynamic drag and <b>uplift</b> <b>forces</b> of the pantograph, the mean value of the contact force and the displacement level of the registration arm can considerably increase as the train runs inside a tunnel. Moreover, the statistical values of the contact forces and the displacement level of the contact wire become larger while the train is passing through the tunnel at different speeds.

Taking the Lijiapo {{landslide}} in Three Gorges Area as an example, {{the study}} {{on the impact of}} seepage field changes caused by water level fluctuation on reservoir landslide stability was carried out. In order to find out the variation in slope stability when the reservoir water level changes at different rate, the stability calculation model was established adopting the Seep module and Slope module of Geoscience software GeoStudio, and calibrated with a long sequence of real-time monitoring data, based on the landslide survey data and test data. The results show that the reservoir landslide stability affected by the seepage field changes with changing reservoir level is controlled by a variety of factors, including the hydrodynamic pressure, hydrostatic pressure, <b>uplift</b> <b>force,</b> physical and mechanical properties (с, φ value change). When the water level fluctuates at a high rate, the impact of the seepage field changes on the stability is mainly affected by the pore water pressure before the stability reaches the extremum, while after the extremum, with the further infiltration or drainage of reservoir water, it is mainly affected by the change of physical and mechanical properties.

The design of these foundations is based on several assumptions and therefore, a large factor of safety is imposed on estimated ultimate uplift capacity. In view of the above, the uplift capacity of shallow foundations on dry sand was determined in the present research by conducting laboratory model tests on circular and square foundation models. The results were compared with the uplift capacities obtained from analytical solutions for both circular and square flat foundations.

In this work the standard wall-to-substrate, wall-to-wall, wall-to-flooring/flooring-to-wall and roof-to-wall connections of three investigated timber building companies are analysed according to their force transmission capacities and applicability during the assembly process.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{stability}} of a crown wall situated above SWL (Still Water Level) {{on top of a}} rubble mound breakwater. Crown walls are concrete super structures implemented commonly to provide a flat surface for pipelines and to make the breakwater accessible for vehicles. The vertical distance between SWL and the bottom of the crown wall {{is referred to as the}} freeboard in this thesis. Current design formulae do not take the freeboard into account when calculating the <b>uplift</b> <b>force</b> on the crown wall. Furthermore design formulae assume that the maximum of the horizontal and vertical force occur at the same time. Previous research noticed that these two maxima might not occur simultaneously. The time difference between both maxima is referred to as phase lag. The first goal of this research is to gain insight in the influence of the freeboard on the <b>uplift</b> <b>force</b> and the uplift pressure distribution. The second goal is to quantify the phase lag. A dataset is needed to achieve both study goals. Two approaches are investigated to obtain a dataset. The first is a numerical model, the second is a physical scale model. The research question is: to determine in what way a numerical model or a physical scale model can be used in order to gather a reliable dataset to realise the project goals. The selected numerical model is the IH- 2 VOF-model. Currently the VOF-model is only validated when the crown wall is (partly) situated below SWL. An experimental dataset was acquired to validate the model. Because the dataset did not provide the exact water depth, it cannot be used to validate the model. For this research physical scale model tests are conducted, in which wave pressures were measured. The recorded pressure data contain a significant amount of noise. Therefore the data are unsuitable to obtain the actual wave force and the exact pressure distribution on the crown wall. It is concluded that the data are only suitable to partially reach the project goals. Current design formulae assume that the uplift pressure reaches the rear end of the crown wall. However, the measured pressure data indicate that the uplift pressure does not reach the rear end. A correlation is found between the relative freeboard and the location at which the uplift pressure becomes 0. A conceptual model is proposed which explains what part of the crown wall experiences an uplift pressure. Furthermore the pressure data are analysed to gain insight in the phase lag. The phase lag appears to be dependent on the relative freeboard and seems to increase with a higher relative freeboard. This finding is explained by a conceptual model which assesses the vertical distance the water travels through the breakwater. This study shows that current design formulae appear to overestimate the <b>uplift</b> <b>force</b> on a crown wall for situations with a freeboard. It also indicates the presence of a phase lag. Furthermore it points out that there are uncertainties about the <b>uplift</b> <b>force</b> on a crown wall. Hence, it is recommended to perform scale model tests whenever a crown wall is designed to gain insight in its stability. Based on investigated articles the VOF-model seems to be a promising tool to perform a stability analysis. However a phase lag was not present in the results of the VOF simulations. Furthermore, options to reduce computation time should be investigated. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

The investigation covers a down-sloping roof configuration at - 5 ° roof angle and two up-sloping roof configurations of roof angles 5 ° and 10 °. The results supplement an earlier study made on a horizontal roof. The wind pressure pattern on the upper surface of an up-sloping roof suggests that there exists a preferred mode of flow separation on that surface. The pattern shows two localized regions of high suction, which are separately located towards the two ends of the roof span. On the up-sloping roofs, this pressure pattern is observed in the time-averaged mean distribution as well as during the occurrence instant of a peak total <b>uplifting</b> <b>force</b> on the roof. On the horizontal roof, this particular pattern of flow separation is not obviously observed in the time-averaged mean wind pressure pattern but is revealed by the conditional sampling technique which captures the wind pressure distribution during the generation of a peak <b>uplifting</b> <b>force</b> on the roof. The wind pressure signals are analysed to study {{the characteristics of the}} total wind force on the roof and also the wind forces on individual roof surfaces. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.
