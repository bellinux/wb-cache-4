50|$|To make a {{point-contact}} transistor work, a brief high-current pulse {{was used}} to fuse the wires to the germanium and create the P-type material around the point of contact, a technique called 'electrical forming'. Usually this was done by charging a capacitor of a specified value to a specified voltage then discharging it between the emitter and the base electrodes. Forming had a significant failure rate, so many commercial encapsulated transistors had to be discarded; an <b>uncased</b> <b>device</b> as could be made by amateurs could be re-formed if damaged.|$|E
