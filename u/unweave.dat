In such cases, product managers {{have to be}} involved in creating and specifying the commonality and variability of the evolving software product line in order to continuously assure a winning business case. In this paper we introduce feature <b>unweaving,</b> a novel approach that allows a product manager to efficiently evolve an integrated graphical requirements model into a product line model: when he or she has identified variable elements, feature <b>unweaving</b> automatically extracts these elements and refactors them into a feature, using an aspect-oriented approach. Feature <b>unweaving</b> significantly reduces the required effort for variability specification, both on a clerical and intellectual level. Furthermore, variability constraints can be added to capture more knowledge about the features and their interdependencies. We evaluate and validate our approach with two case studies...|$|R

6000|$|This poem was {{composed}} {{in its first}} form as early as May, 1832 or 1833, as we learn from Fitzgerald's note--of the exact year he was not certain ('Life of Tennyson', i., 147). The evolution of the poem is an interesting study. How greatly it was altered in the second edition of 1842 will be evident from the collation which follows. The text of 1842 became the permanent text, and in this no subsequent material alterations were made. The poem is more purely fanciful than Tennyson perhaps was willing to own; certainly his explanation of the allegory, as {{he gave it to}} Canon Ainger, is not very intelligible: [...] "The new-born love for something, for some one in the wide world from which she has been so long excluded, takes her out of the region of shadows into that of realities". Poe's commentary is most to the point: [...] "Why do some persons fatigue themselves in endeavours to unravel such phantasy pieces as the 'Lady of Shallot'? As well <b>unweave</b> the ventum textilem".--'Democratic Review', Dec., 1844, quoted by Mr. Herne Shepherd. Mr. Palgrave says (selection from the 'Lyric Poems of Tennyson', p. 257) the poem was suggested by an Italian romance upon the Donna di Scalotta. On what authority this is said I do not know, nor can I identify the novel. In Novella, lxxxi., a collection of novels printed at Milan in 1804, there is one which tells but very briefly the story of Elaine's love and death, [...] "Qui conta come la Damigella di scalot mori per amore di Lancealotto di Lac," [...] and as in this novel Camelot is placed near the sea, this may be the novel referred to. In any case the poem is a fanciful and possibly an allegorical variant of the story of Elaine, Shalott being a form, through the French, of Astolat.|$|E

40|$|The {{majority}} of aspect-oriented middlewares supporting dynamic aspect weaving fail to preserve important safety properties while weaving or <b>unweaving</b> a distributed aspect at runtime. This position paper looks in particular at the safety properties of structural integrity and global state consistency. Preserving these two safety {{properties in the}} presence of dynamic change has already been extensively addressed in the space of dynamic reconfiguration of component-based distributed systems. As will be argued in this position paper, existing coordination protocols developed in this space can be largely reused for distributed aspect weaving provided that some small adaptations are made to account for the aspect-oriented composition mechanisms. To demonstrate results and as a proof-of-concept, we describe how we have ported the NeCoMan dynamic reconfiguration support on top of the JBoss AOP framework. As a result, system-wide consistency can be preserved in JBoss when weaving or <b>unweaving</b> a distributed aspect at runtime...|$|R

Another construction project, the I-35W/US 10/I-694 North Central Corridor Reconstruction Project, also designed to <b>unweave</b> the highway, began in September, 2011. This project will eliminate the weaving movements of I-694 at its interchange with U.S. Highway 10 (US 10) and MN 51 in Arden Hills. This interchange often creates one of the worst bottlenecks in the Twin Cities because drivers need to change at least one lane to continue either direction on I-694 between MN 51 (Snelling Avenue) and US 10. When the construction project is completed, the roadway of I-694 will include three thru-lanes in each direction from I-35W at New Brighton to US 10 at Arden Hills; four thru-lanes in each direction from US 10 in Arden Hills to Rice Street at Shoreview-Little Canada; and five thru-lanes in each direction from Rice Street to the I-694-I-35E interchange, compared with the current two to three lanes throughout the I-694 corridor.|$|E
