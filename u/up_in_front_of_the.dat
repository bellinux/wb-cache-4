5|$|Typically, the labial palpi are prominent, three-segmented, {{springing}} {{from under}} the head and curving <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> face. There is great variation in morphology of labial palpi in different families of Lepidoptera; sometimes the palpi are separate and sometimes they are connivent and form a beak, but they are always independently movable. In other cases, the labial palpi may not be erect but porrect (projecting forward horizontally).|$|E
5|$|Carabane {{has many}} {{historic}} sites, {{such as the}} Catholic mission house built in 1880 which has since {{been turned into a}} hotel, a Brittany-style church building which is no longer in use, and a former slave-trade building. There is also a French cemetery where a Troupes de marine-Captain with the name Aristide Protet was shot with a poisoned arrow and buried standing <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sea, according to his last wishes. Some tour guides falsely claim that this was Auguste Léopold Protet, the founder of the city of Dakar, but the name Aristide Protet is clearly shown on the tomb's plaque.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Rachel {{decides to}} return to her community. Mr. Will is bailed out of jail by Tim, who is looking for Rachel. Together, he and Mr. Will drive out to the community, and on the way they {{discover}} Clyde, whose van has broken down on the highway. As Rachel is about to be wed, Tim, Mr. Will, and Clyde pull <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church in the red Mustang and rescue her. Mr. Will returns to the community and is accepted back with a confession that Rachel has recorded on the blue cassette, although she still firmly believes that God has fathered her child. Some months later, Clyde and a visibly pregnant Rachel are living in a tent by the beach and hold hands as they walk through the waves.|$|E

5|$|Tickets {{were made}} {{available}} to members of Madonna's official fan club, Icon, and winners with details announced at Madonna.com and through concert promoter Telstra's promotional webpage. According to newspaper reports, the tickets were non-transferable, and had the person's name printed on them. However, {{all of them were}} in the general admission category at Forum Theatre, which holds a maximum capacity of 1,500. With the production design and addition of catwalk, the space allocated became smaller than that. Prior to the show The Sydney Morning Herald reported that fans started queuing <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> venue, while Madonna rehearsed inside, as well as at Hisense Arena. Images and songs rehearsed were leaked to fan website Drownedmadonna.com, along with Madonna's manager Guy Oseary uploading pictures on Instagram. Madonna made several references to clowns on her own Instagram account, including uploading a short video of her riding a small tricycle. The show was confirmed to be recorded and released along with the DVD for the Rebel Heart Tour.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{a number of}} films have shot some of their scenes in Rathfarnham. The opening scene in Intermission was {{recorded}} at Rathfarnham Shopping Centre. In one scene in the movie Ordinary Decent Criminal, a car is blown <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pearse Museum in St Enda's Park.

25|$|The {{following}} week at Bristol, while running 5th, leader Denny Hamlin was wrecked by Kevin Harvick while racing for the lead, which then sent Hamlin's {{car into the}} inside wall. Hamlin's car then slid right back <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> No. 88 and slammed into the left-side door of the car, and the contact was bad enough to send Earnhardt behind the wall, and suffer a 39th-place finish. This was his second DNF of the year, after the early exit in the spring Texas race.|$|E

25|$|Among the {{exhibits}} are two enormous solid gold candleholders, each weighing 48kg and mounted with 6,666 cut diamonds, a present of Sultan Abdülmecid I to the Kaaba {{in the holy}} city of Mecca. They were brought back to Istanbul shortly before the Ottoman Empire lost control over Mecca. The gold ceremonial Bayram throne, mounted with tourmalines, was made in 1585 by order of the vizier Ibrahim Pasha and presented to Sultan Murad III. This throne would be set <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gate of Felicity on special audiences.|$|E
25|$|At 5:30am on 16 December, after a 30-minute cannon and rocket barrage, the 3rd {{platoon of}} Company A was {{attacked}} by a strong German force which had penetrated the infantry lines. This {{became one of the}} decisive actions of the Battle of the Bulge. The battalion's actions during this action resulted in it being recognized with a Presidential Unit Citation. The enemy was driven off by vigorous counterattacks by Company A, fighting as infantry, and the U.S. lines were restored. Many enemy dead were piled <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lines and 21 POWs were taken.|$|E
25|$|The {{ergonomic}} {{design of the}} controls such as handles, launcher, barrel shape and optical sight, is predefined standard. All controls are easy to handle in all shooting positions (lying, kneeling or standing). After the weapon is fired, the firing mechanism with the attached optical sight is removed and the barrel thrown away, the firing mechanism is reusable. The effective combat range of Panzerfaust 3 is between 15 and 300 metres against moving and 400 and 600 metres against static targets. An optical sight with line pattern fixed to the reusable firing mechanism enables to engage moving or static targets. To ensure night combat capability, a night-vision device or residual light amplifier can be set <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> optical sight.|$|E

25|$|It {{now turned}} out that the {{apparent}} deployment of the States Army in front of the village had been a ruse to draw the Spaniards in. In reality, the reinforced camp of Boussu was located behind the village and his artillery was drawn <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> real line. Five hundred Spanish musketeers and six hundred cavalry now found themselves in very perilous circumstances. The Scottish soldiers stripped to the waist, while singing psalms, and attacked the astounded Spaniards. At the same time the States's artillery opened fire. The Spanish troops were in danger of being annihilated. However, Parma personally extricated them by way of a covered path through the village, while executing one of his famous cavalry manoeuvres. This ended the battle, as Boussu did not follow through.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} antique Testament of Solomon, Abyzou (as Obizuth) is {{described}} as having a “greenish gleaming face with dishevelled serpent-like hair”; {{the rest of her}} body is covered by darkness. The speaker (“King Solomon”) encounters a series of demons, binds and tortures each in turn, and inquires into their activities; then he metes out punishment or controls them as he sees fit. Put to the test, Abyzou says that she does not sleep, but rather wanders the world looking for women about to give birth; given the opportunity, she will strangle newborns. She claims also to be the source of many other afflictions, including deafness, eye trouble, obstructions of the throat, madness, and bodily pain. Solomon orders that she be chained by her own hair and hung <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Temple in public view. The writer of the Testament appears to have been thinking of the gorgoneion, or the icon of the Medusa’s head, which often adorned Greek temples and occasionally Jewish synagogues in late antiquity.|$|E
25|$|A unique {{supersonic}} {{escape capsule}} {{was designed for}} the XF-103. The pilot's seat was located in a shell with a large movable shield in front that was normally slid down into the area {{in front of the}} pilot's legs. In the case of depressurization, the shield would slide <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pilot, sealing the seat into a pressurized pod. Basic flight instruments inside the capsule allowed the aircraft to be flown back to base, and a window {{in the front of the}} shield allowed the periscope system to be used. In an emergency, the entire capsule would be ejected downward, along with a small portion of the aircraft fuselage that provided a stable aerodynamic shape. To enter and exit the aircraft, the ejection module was lowered on rails out of the bottom of the aircraft, allowing the pilot to simply walk into the seat, sit down, and raise the module into the aircraft. The capsule was fully pressurized, allowing the pilot to continue operating the aircraft without a pressure suit when the capsule was locked up.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the tickets}} sale opening, The MDNA Tour {{attained}} a huge demand from public and many venues were instantly sold out. Six {{weeks before the}} premiere, Arthur Fogel, chairman of Live Nation Global Touring, had already made an estimate that the tour was on track {{to be among the}} top-ten tours of all time. He announced that more than 1.4 million tickets had been already sold up to that point, banking about US$214 million for an average US$2.7 million per show in a mix of stadiums and arenas. Madonna's first ever show in Abu Dhabi had fans lined <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Virgin Megastore for tickets of 24 hours before they went on general sale, according to local newspaper The National. All initial 22,000 tickets sold out in record-breaking one hour, prompting the promoter to add the second date there. All tickets for Madonna's concert in Istanbul sold out in four days. German news agency Deutsche Presse-Agentur reported that both of Madonna's shows in Berlin sold out only in few hours after tickets went on sale. All available tickets for Madonna's first date in Amsterdam sold out in 30 minutes.|$|E
