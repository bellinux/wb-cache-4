Mejdal's interest in baseball was recreational until 2003, when Moneyball {{inspired him to}} consider pursuing a career in sabermetrics. He attended the Winter Meetings in search {{for a job in}} baseball, but ended up working for NASA as a biomathematician in the Fatigue Countermeasures Group. Mejdal studied sleep patterns of astronauts on the International Space Station in order to optimize their sleep schedules.|$|E

Derrick first joined his <b>unit</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Wayville Showgrounds, before basic {{training}} at Woodside. Derrick thrived on military life, but found discipline difficult to accept.|$|E

At the southern end are sediments derived from the Klamath Mountains, while sand of the overlying Tyee Formation has an isotopic composition corresponding to rock of the Idaho Batholith.|$|E
5|$|A MaK-built DB Class 240 {{locomotive}} was test-run in Norway during 1990. On 23 November 1992, NSB's board {{decided to}} order ten similar units. The order was later expanded with another two units because NSB {{was offered a}} lower price than originally stipulated. The Di6 would have motors from Siemens, who had bought MaK, and would be optimized for Norwegian conditions and standards. The contract was worth NOK380 million, or NOK32 million per <b>unit.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time, NSB also made an order for 20 smaller diesel-electric locomotives from MaK, the Di8. Between the two new classes, they were to replace all the Di3s.|$|E

5|$|Congressional {{reaction}} to the losses suffered by Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer's <b>unit</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Battle of the Little Big Horn in 1876 was shock and dismay at {{the failure of the}} Peace Policy. Grant blamed Custer wholly for the defeat stating that the sacrifice of troops was unnecessary. The Indian appropriations measure of August 1876 marked the end of Grant's Peace Policy. The Sioux were given the choice of either selling their lands in the Black Hills for cash or not receiving government gifts of food and other supplies.|$|E
5|$|The Galveston Division of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, {{the first}} federal court in Texas, is based in Galveston and has {{jurisdiction}} over the counties of Galveston, Brazoria, Chambers and Matagorda. It is housed in the United States Post Office, Customs House and Court House federal building in downtown Galveston. The United States Postal Service operates several post offices in Galveston, including the Galveston Main Post Office and the Bob Lyons Post Office Station. In addition the post office has a contract postal <b>unit</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Medical Branch Unit {{on the campus of}} the University of Texas Medical Branch and the West Galveston Contract Postal Unit, located on the west end of Galveston Island in the beachside community of Jamaica Beach.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} Woodruff's {{clinical}} transplant program was recognised and enhanced by {{funding from the}} Nuffield Foundation to construct and open the Nuffield Transplant Surgery <b>Unit</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Western General Hospital in Edinburgh. In 1970 an outbreak of hepatitis B struck the transplant unit, resulting {{in the death of}} several patients and four of Woodruff's employees due to fulminant hepatic failure. Woodruff was deeply shaken by the loss and the unit was closed for a period while an investigation was carried out to develop a contingency plan to avoid such a disaster in future. The unit then resumed operations.|$|E

However, this space is not completely empty, and is sparsely filled with cosmic rays, which include ionized atomic nuclei and various subatomic particles. There is also gas, plasma and dust, small meteors, and several dozen types of organic molecules discovered to date by microwave spectroscopy. A cloud of interplanetary dust is visible at night as a faint band called the zodiacal light.|$|E
5|$|In November 1970, the Dovre Line was electrified, and {{the last}} steam {{locomotives}} were retired. A long-term plan to electrify half the lines was finished, and for two decades, NSB's operations were very stable with no major investments to infrastructure or closing of lines. NSB had slightly less diesel locomotives than they needed, but plans to order additional Di 3 was never fulfilled. In 1981, NSB took delivery of five Di 4 to supplement the older units. They were mainly used on the Nordland Line, and Di 3 units were predominantly used on the other lines, although they continued to operate som trains on the Nordland Line. On 1 April 1987, a Di 3 612 caught on fire; the damage was small enough {{that it could have}} been repaired, but NSB instead decided to put aside the <b>unit.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> time NSB planned to order additional Di 4, but these plans were put on hold. In 1988, the Valdres Line was closed; this was the only time a line with Di 3 in regular service was closed.|$|E
5|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2015 season, three practice sessions were scheduled, two 1.5-hour sessions on Friday and another one-hour session before qualifying on Saturday. Lewis Hamilton was fastest {{in the first}} free practice session, run in clear and sunny conditions, lapping {{in a time of}} 1m43.754s, over one-tenth of a second faster than teammate Rosberg in second. Rosberg had set new fastest sector times on his last fast run, but a mistake in {{the last part of the}} track lost him a chance at the best time. Kimi Räikkönen was third fastest for Ferrari, ahead of Daniil Kvyat. Kvyat's Red Bull teammate Ricciardo changed back to his older specification Renault power unit, after being unsatisfied with the performance of his updated <b>unit</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> previous race in Brazil. He finished the session seventh fastest. At Lotus, Jolyon Palmer replaced Romain Grosjean, but had to sit out most of the session due to a water leak, managing just nine laps.|$|E
