25|$|Mutable: The mutable {{signs are}} Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, and Pisces. A native with mainly mutable signs are adaptable, {{co-operative}} and friendly. They can fit into almost any situation, put <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>anything</b> and turn any situation to their advantage. Mutable people can steer projects through periods of transition {{and bring them}} to a successful conclusion. Although gentle and likeable, mutable subjects seem to have more than their fair share of problems and can be selfish and ruthless when they feel threatened. These subjects may devote their lives to helping others, but they can often paradoxically be surprisingly selfish at the same time. Subjects lacking mutable signs may be unable to adapt to any kind of change and be particularly unhappy when faced with uncertainty. They need lots of notice before they will commit themselves to anything, and lack flexibility and adaptability. They may also hold onto rigid and unchanging views. Planets in the 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th houses will help to compensate for this lack, and water signs in the chart will make up for the lack of intuition.|$|E

Pleased with the Volume 4 album, the band sought to recreate the recording atmosphere, and {{returned to}} the Record Plant studio in Los Angeles. With new musical innovations of the era, the band were surprised to find that the room they had used previously at the Record Plant was replaced by a [...] "giant synthesiser". The band rented a house in Bel Air and began writing in the summer of 1973, but in part because of substance issues and fatigue, they were unable to complete any songs. [...] "Ideas weren't coming out the way they were on Volume 4 and we really got discontent" [...] Iommi said. [...] "Everybody was sitting there waiting for me to come up with something.

500|$|After a {{farewell}} tour in 1993, Dickinson left Iron Maiden and {{started working on}} a second album with Tribe of Gypsies guitarist and band leader, Roy Z. In June 1994, he released Balls to Picasso, which reached the top30 in several countries. Allmusic deemed the album [...] "somewhat of a disappointment" [...] which failed to [...] "come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>anything</b> truly groundbreaking", except for [...] "Tears of the Dragon", which was released as a single, along with [...] "Shoot All the Clowns". Roy Z departed to continue with his work and Dickinson recruited new members, with whom he released the double-disc live performance, Alive in Studio A. The third album, Skunkworks, was released in 1996, marking a [...] "highly approved stylistic shift". The single [...] "Back from the Edge" [...] was released to promote this effort. A live video and an EP were recorded from a concert in Spain, and released in Japan, as Skunkworks Live.|$|E

[...] He closed his review saying, [...] "As usual, what gives the film whatever interest it has -- beyond satisfying the rapacious appetites of gore aficionados -- is the moral element attached to the various Rube Goldberg-style set pieces. Here, it's exemplified by a well-staged sequence in which a man must choose who lives or dies during a particularly lethal variation of musical chairs." [...] Roger Moore of Orlando Sentinel gave the film two out of five stars. He said the script [...] "has a more lyrical bent, and a more satiric bite, {{than any of the other}} Saw sequels" [...] and called the acting [...] "perfunctory on most fronts". [...] Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times gave the film a negative review, writing [...] "But, really, do reformers and victims of callous health insurers really want a guy with a penchant for elaborately constructed death panels of his own to be their advocate? Elsewhere, the usual critiques apply: terrible acting, zero suspense, laughable logic and the promise of another one next year. How can we get this policy canceled?" [...] Chris Hewitt of the St. Paul Pioneer Press gave the film a negative review. He was displeased that the film offered nothing new saying, [...] "The first three Saw movies had some intriguing ideas and an unusual way of presenting them, but the three most recent films have barely bothered to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>anything</b> fresh." [...] Kim Newman of Empire gave the film three out of five, stating [...] "Saw VI gets back to Saw basics in gripping, gruesome manner." ...|$|E

60|$|Then he {{sat back}} in his chair, and began to wrestle with this new development. Barry must play. That was certain. All the bluff in the world was not going to keep him from playing the best man at his {{disposal}} in the Ripton match. He himself did not count. It was the school he had to think of. This being so, what was likely to happen? Though nothing was said on the point, he felt certain that if he persisted in ignoring the League, that bat would find its way somehow--by devious routes, possibly--to the headmaster or some one else in authority. And then there would be questions--awkward questions--and things would begin to come out. Then a fresh point struck him, which was, that whatever might happen would affect, not himself, but O'Hara. This made it rather more of a problem how to act. Personally, {{he was one of those}} dogged characters who can put <b>up</b> <b>with</b> almost <b>anything</b> themselves. If this had been his affair, he would have gone on his way without hesitating.

Within 2 years, the Canadian pharmacy landscape will look vastly different than it does today. I say this for several reasons.

The three decided that Quarashi was a better name for their group than their original name, and so, in 1996, in a garage {{in a house in}} Reykjavík, Iceland, Quarashi was formed.|$|E

[...] “Despite our calls, nobody is coming <b>up</b> to us <b>with</b> <b>anything.</b> You can’t resolve issues that were developed over hundreds of years in a single night.” In the subsequent Q&A session, he was asked why he kept addressing them exclusively as mothers, overlooking {{the fact that they}} are fully-fledged economic, political and juridical persons. Erdoğan's widely noted answer was: [...] "I do not believe in the equality of men and women. I believe in equal opportunities. Men and women are different and complementary." ...|$|R

[...] TouchMyApps said [...] "Blue Defense! is tastefully designed and brimming with twists, turns and tongue biting. Its polished graphics, smooth animation and habit-forming gameplay are praiseworthy, but without sound and a global scoring system it feels somewhat unfinished. So, is it worth the 99 cents? Absolutely". 148Apps wrote [...] "Fantastic, simple, fun, wonderful game. Very unexpected but very much appreciated. Easily one of my favorite games thus far for the iPhone.|$|R

Bollywood Hungama rated the album 1.5 out of 5 saying, [...] "Robot disappoints. While Rahman himself hasn't come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>anything</b> exceptional, something which is expected from him film after film; it's the lyrics that are chief culprit here. It is clear that a lot has been lost in translation here, literally so, as the song dubbing Tamil to Hindi just doesn't work here." [...] Glamsham published a positive review saying, [...] "Robot is stylishly packed sci-fi musical entertainer, exuding out multifaceted classy acts from the maestro. Its herculean effort to compile and compose a set of situational soundtracks with that extra trendy grace and poise but Robot delivers all with style, thanks to A.R Rahman's ever-reliable expertise." [...] Rediff rated the Hindi version 2.5 on 5 and commented that Robot is not Rahman's best, to say the least. The Times of India commented that [...] "On the whole, the music of Robot does not appeal. They may suit the script of the sci-film, but the audio is not impressive." ...|$|E

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 79, based on 25 reviews. Dan Weiss of Consequence of Sound said, [...] "The singing and melodies are massaged with a care unheard in the prior Drake discography; this album flows as improbably as The Life of Pablo, with more assured lyrics and smoother sequencing, {{to offset the}} lack of a certifiable genius at the helm." [...] Erin Lowers of Exclaim! said, [...] "Excluding its minor gaffes, More Life cements a place for genres long-overlooked by mainstream media; dancehall, grime, Afrobeat, house, trap and, of course, rap, and takes Toronto on a world tour to celebrate life—More life." [...] David Turner of The Guardian said, [...] "Even if the album lacks the humor of the Views songs [...] "9" [...] or [...] "Childs Play"—no line here bests [...] "Why you gotta fight with me at Cheesecake / You know I love to go there"—the breadth of styles recalls his 2012-2015 SoundCloud that found space for both Fetty Wap and James Blake remixes." [...] Clayton Purdom of The A.V. Club said, [...] "More Life is light, often weightless. Despite its playlist tag, it is unmistakably a Drake album—it even has a Blueprint highball closer like each of its predecessors—and as an album, it is probably Drake's worst. But as a collection of totally atomized songs and ideas, it's <b>up</b> there <b>with</b> <b>anything</b> he's released." [...] Preezy of XXL said, [...] "While fans and critics argue over whether or not he's one of the greatest MCs of his generation, let alone among the greatest of all-time, Drake continues to prove his worth as an elite talent with More Life, another blockbuster from rap's golden child with the midas touch." ...|$|R
