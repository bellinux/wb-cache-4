25|$|Mutable: The mutable {{signs are}} Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, and Pisces. A native with mainly mutable signs are adaptable, {{co-operative}} and friendly. They can fit into almost any situation, put <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>anything</b> and turn any situation to their advantage. Mutable people can steer projects through periods of transition {{and bring them}} to a successful conclusion. Although gentle and likeable, mutable subjects seem to have more than their fair share of problems and can be selfish and ruthless when they feel threatened. These subjects may devote their lives to helping others, but they can often paradoxically be surprisingly selfish at the same time. Subjects lacking mutable signs may be unable to adapt to any kind of change and be particularly unhappy when faced with uncertainty. They need lots of notice before they will commit themselves to anything, and lack flexibility and adaptability. They may also hold onto rigid and unchanging views. Planets in the 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th houses will help to compensate for this lack, and water signs in the chart will make up for the lack of intuition.|$|E

[...] This is an allusion to the poet Homer, who was also captivated with the nature versus nurture debate.

500|$|Following the Volume 4 world tour, Black Sabbath {{returned}} to Los Angeles {{to begin work}} on their next release. Pleased with the Volume 4 album, the band sought to recreate the recording atmosphere, and {{returned to}} the Record Plant studio in Los Angeles. With new musical innovations of the era, the band were surprised to find that the room they had used previously at the Record Plant was replaced by a [...] "giant synthesiser". The band rented a house in Bel Air and began writing in the summer of 1973, but in part because of substance issues and fatigue, they were unable to complete any songs. [...] "Ideas weren't coming out the way they were on Volume 4 and we really got discontent" [...] Iommi said. [...] "Everybody was sitting there waiting for me to come up with something. I just couldn't think of anything. And if I didn't come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>anything,</b> nobody would do anything." ...|$|E
500|$|After a {{farewell}} tour in 1993, Dickinson left Iron Maiden and {{started working on}} a second album with Tribe of Gypsies guitarist and band leader, Roy Z. In June 1994, he released Balls to Picasso, which reached the top30 in several countries. Allmusic deemed the album [...] "somewhat of a disappointment" [...] which failed to [...] "come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>anything</b> truly groundbreaking", except for [...] "Tears of the Dragon", which was released as a single, along with [...] "Shoot All the Clowns". Roy Z departed to continue with his work and Dickinson recruited new members, with whom he released the double-disc live performance, Alive in Studio A. The third album, Skunkworks, was released in 1996, marking a [...] "highly approved stylistic shift". The single [...] "Back from the Edge" [...] was released to promote this effort. A live video and an EP were recorded from a concert in Spain, and released in Japan, as Skunkworks Live.|$|E
500|$|Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "If this is torture porn, it's {{as if it}} was {{designed}} to be enjoyed by Michael Moore." [...] He closed his review saying, [...] "As usual, what gives the film whatever interest it has -- beyond satisfying the rapacious appetites of gore aficionados -- is the moral element attached to the various Rube Goldberg-style set pieces. Here, it's exemplified by a well-staged sequence in which a man must choose who lives or dies during a particularly lethal variation of musical chairs." [...] Roger Moore of Orlando Sentinel gave the film two out of five stars. He said the script [...] "has a more lyrical bent, and a more satiric bite, {{than any of the other}} Saw sequels" [...] and called the acting [...] "perfunctory on most fronts". [...] Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times gave the film a negative review, writing [...] "But, really, do reformers and victims of callous health insurers really want a guy with a penchant for elaborately constructed death panels of his own to be their advocate? Elsewhere, the usual critiques apply: terrible acting, zero suspense, laughable logic and the promise of another one next year. How can we get this policy canceled?" [...] Chris Hewitt of the St. Paul Pioneer Press gave the film a negative review. He was displeased that the film offered nothing new saying, [...] "The first three Saw movies had some intriguing ideas and an unusual way of presenting them, but the three most recent films have barely bothered to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>anything</b> fresh." [...] Kim Newman of Empire gave the film three out of five, stating [...] "Saw VI gets back to Saw basics in gripping, gruesome manner." ...|$|E

When the party learns of the Queen's role in the attacks on Burmecia, Steiner finds himself torn up inside {{at the fact that}} such horrible deeds could be committed by the person he's dedicated his life to defending.

60|$|Then he {{sat back}} in his chair, and began to wrestle with this new development. Barry must play. That was certain. All the bluff in the world was not going to keep him from playing the best man at his {{disposal}} in the Ripton match. He himself did not count. It was the school he had to think of. This being so, what was likely to happen? Though nothing was said on the point, he felt certain that if he persisted in ignoring the League, that bat would find its way somehow--by devious routes, possibly--to the headmaster or some one else in authority. And then there would be questions--awkward questions--and things would begin to come out. Then a fresh point struck him, which was, that whatever might happen would affect, not himself, but O'Hara. This made it rather more of a problem how to act. Personally, {{he was one of those}} dogged characters who can put <b>up</b> <b>with</b> almost <b>anything</b> themselves. If this had been his affair, he would have gone on his way without hesitating. Evidently the writer of the letter was under the impression that he had been the hero (or villain) of the statue escapade.|$|R

As usual, she doesnât have the edginess to pull the vocals off, but Pitbull adds any flavour Jennifer should have injected. He may come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>anything</b> new, but it at least helps the {{production}}, which is some of the best production on the album due to Diploâs hand in it.

2500|$|According to Vig, {{the team}} drew {{inspiration}} for {{its name from}} a hostile early comment, when {{a friend of the}} band heard recording material, probably for [...] "Vow" [...] and groaned, [...] "This shit sounds like garbage!" [...] However, according to This Is The Noise That keeps Me Awake, an autobiography of the band, Vig wrote in his 1993 studio journal about the creative process; of working for long periods of time, [...] "without coming <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>anything</b> cool... and when you least expect it, it all falls into place." [...] The name derives from the last line of this entry: [...] "I hope that all this garbage will become something beautiful!".|$|E
2500|$|Originally, HÃ¶ssi would sing, while Steini would rap, {{but when}} SÃ¶lvi heard HÃ¶ssi rap, {{he decided that}} his musical group would have two rappers.

Quarashi was Steini's nickname as a skater, and was spray-painted all over the walls and streets in ReykjavÃ­k. The three decided that Quarashi was a better name for their group than their original name, and so, in 1996, in a garage {{in a house in}} ReykjavÃ­k, Iceland, Quarashi was formed.|$|E

He advised them to contribute instead of just criticizing, saying [...] "those who allege that the democratic opening has no content, they can fill it themselves. We are ready for this." [...] âDespite our calls, nobody is coming <b>up</b> to us <b>with</b> <b>anything.</b> You canât resolve issues that were developed over hundreds of years in a single night.â In the subsequent Q&A session, he was asked why he kept addressing them exclusively as mothers, overlooking {{the fact that they}} are fully-fledged economic, political and juridical persons. ErdoÄan's widely noted answer was: [...] "I do not believe in the equality of men and women. I believe in equal opportunities. Men and women are different and complementary." ...|$|R

Appadvice wrote [...] "Blue Defense! is a fun little game that doesnât clutter <b>up</b> the experience <b>with</b> <b>anything.</b> Those looking for something reminiscent of arcade classics like Space Invaders, Galaga, or other vertical shooters will be pleased. If you donât like primary colors, silence, or are afraid of your iPhone getting motion sickness, this game is not for you. Personally, I enjoyed it for a day and didnât open it up again until this review". [...] TouchMyApps said [...] "Blue Defense! is tastefully designed and brimming with twists, turns and tongue biting. Its polished graphics, smooth animation and habit-forming gameplay are praiseworthy, but without sound and a global scoring system it feels somewhat unfinished. So, is it worth the 99 cents? Absolutely". 148Apps wrote [...] "Fantastic, simple, fun, wonderful game. Very unexpected but very much appreciated. Easily one of my favorite games thus far for the iPhone.|$|R

2500|$|The Hindi version {{received}} notably mixed responses, {{with most}} of the reviewers criticising Swanand Kirkire's lyrics. Bollywood Hungama rated the album 1.5 out of 5 saying, [...] "Robot disappoints. While Rahman himself hasn't come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>anything</b> exceptional, something which is expected from him film after film; it's the lyrics that are chief culprit here. It is clear that a lot has been lost in translation here, literally so, as the song dubbing Tamil to Hindi just doesn't work here." [...] Glamsham published a positive review saying, [...] "Robot is stylishly packed sci-fi musical entertainer, exuding out multifaceted classy acts from the maestro. Its herculean effort to compile and compose a set of situational soundtracks with that extra trendy grace and poise but Robot delivers all with style, thanks to A.R Rahman's ever-reliable expertise." [...] Rediff rated the Hindi version 2.5 on 5 and commented that Robot is not Rahman's best, to say the least. The Times of India commented that [...] "On the whole, the music of Robot does not appeal. They may suit the script of the sci-film, but the audio is not impressive." ...|$|E

5000|$|More Life {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 79, based on 25 reviews. Dan Weiss of Consequence of Sound said, [...] "The singing and melodies are massaged with a care unheard in the prior Drake discography; this album flows as improbably as The Life of Pablo, with more assured lyrics and smoother sequencing, {{to offset the}} lack of a certifiable genius at the helm." [...] Erin Lowers of Exclaim! said, [...] "Excluding its minor gaffes, More Life cements a place for genres long-overlooked by mainstream media; dancehall, grime, Afrobeat, house, trap and, of course, rap, and takes Toronto on a world tour to celebrate lifeâMore life." [...] David Turner of The Guardian said, [...] "Even if the album lacks the humor of the Views songs [...] "9" [...] or [...] "Childs Play"âno line here bests [...] "Why you gotta fight with me at Cheesecake / You know I love to go there"âthe breadth of styles recalls his 2012-2015 SoundCloud that found space for both Fetty Wap and James Blake remixes." [...] Clayton Purdom of The A.V. Club said, [...] "More Life is light, often weightless. Despite its playlist tag, it is unmistakably a Drake albumâit even has a Blueprint highball closer like each of its predecessorsâand as an album, it is probably Drake's worst. But as a collection of totally atomized songs and ideas, it's <b>up</b> there <b>with</b> <b>anything</b> he's released." [...] Preezy of XXL said, [...] "While fans and critics argue over whether or not he's one of the greatest MCs of his generation, let alone among the greatest of all-time, Drake continues to prove his worth as an elite talent with More Life, another blockbuster from rap's golden child with the midas touch." ...|$|R
