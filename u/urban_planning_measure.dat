Current {{literature}} on managing health risks of heatwaves {{highlights the importance of}} implementing <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> <b>measures,</b> and engaging with vulnerable groups on a local level to better understand perceptions of risk and tailor health protection measures. This paper reviews arrangements to reduce heatwave health risks in South East Queensland in response to these themes.

40|$|Pedestrian {{accidents}} {{are one of}} the most prominent causes of premature injury, handicap and death in the modern world. In children, the problem is so severe that pedestrian {{accidents are}} widely regarded as the most serious of all health risks facing children in developed countries. Not surprisingly, educational measures have long been advocated as a means of teaching children how to cope with traffic and substantial resources have been devoted to their development and provision. Unfortunately, there seems to be a widespread view at the present time that education has not achieved as much as had been hoped and that there may even be quite strict limits to what can be achieved through education. This would, of course, shift the emphasis away from education altogether towards engineering or <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> <b>measures</b> aimed at creating an intrinsically safer environment in which the need for education might be reduced or even eliminated. However, whilst engineering measures undoubtedly have a major role to play in the effort to reduce accidents, this outlook is both overly optimistic about the benefits of engineering and overly pessimistic about the limitations of education. At the same time, a fresh analysis is clearly required both of the aims and methods of contemporary road safety education.

40|$|This chapter {{examines}} {{the use of}} legal tools to promote healthier behaviours and environments for nutrition and physical activity. It begins with {{an overview of the}} role of regulation in public health and discusses justifications for legislative intervention to address health risks and problems. Arguments about the appropriate role of the state in regulating areas - food choices, physical activity, and body weight - that some consider a matter of personal responsibility are briefly considered, along with questions about the evidence needed to support regulatory strategies. The main focus of the chapter is on interventions to promote healthier nutrition as this is where the most regulatory activity has occurred. Humans need food to survive but, increasingly, an overabundance of food, especially food that is calorie-dense and nutrient-poor, is contributing to conditions that {{have a negative impact on}} health and may even contribute to declining life expectancy. Legislators in many jurisdictions are enacting laws to influence or control consumer food choices and food industry practices. These include rules and restrictions on food labeling, advertising, ingredients and access. Litigation against food manufacturers or retailers is briefly discussed as a private enforcement strategy to improve the food environment. The chapter also discusses examples of regulatory interventions that focus on promoting physical activity, such as tax credits for sports participation and <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> <b>measures</b> to encourage walking and cycling...|$|R

40|$|A vast body of {{research}} demonstrates that living in &# 039;more walkable&# 039; neighbourhoods is associated with increased walking, and in turn, positively impacts selected health behaviours and outcomes. Yet, walkable neighbourhoods are not always delivered. The aims {{of this study were}} to identify Australian <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> policies designed to foster &# 039;walkability&# 039;, and to test measures based on these policies with transport walking behaviours in adults. Overall, 14 Australian state level <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> policies related to walking were identified. Spatial measures were developed based on these <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> policies, and linked with geocoded population survey data. Associations between the <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> spatial <b>measures</b> and neighbourhood transport walking behaviours were tested in a sample of urban adults (n= 16, 890). The odds of transport walking were significantly higher for those living in &# 039;more walkable&# 039; (compared with less walkable) neighbourhoods; i. e. with more connected street networks, higher residential densities, more destinations available, and shorter block sizes and distances to activity centres. Our findings showed that all 14 policies implemented in GIS were independently associated with walking in the residential neighbourhood. The associations observed tended to be stronger than previously shown, especially in regard to the dwelling density and daily destination measures. Our findings support the calls for more research using policy-relevant measures in order to better inform <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> guidance, and suggests that if current spatially derived urban policies were implemented, it may increase transport walking. This research has the potential to contribute to building consensus for <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> policies related to walking...|$|R
40|$|For {{the last}} decades, {{residents}} {{have moved to}} the suburbs {{in order to satisfy}} their desire for a house with a garden. Being far less accessible than residences in cities, these suburban areas often require longer commuting distances and motorised travel and therefore cause greater emissions and energy consumption than compact development. Recently, new living concepts that combine suburban housing types with urban amenities are emerging within the urban fabric. In this paper it will be discussed if these new living concepts promote energy efficient mobility and if they are an alternative to suburban residences. By analysing the daily mobility of residents living in a new inner-city area in Berlin, the results suggest that this area mostly attracts families who welcomed the combination of living in a central location with good public transport access and having a house with a garden. In the context of daily mobility, an interesting mismatch was found: over 80 % of the households have a car – this is highly above average in Berlin. However, the residents make more than half of their trips by foot or by bike. Nonetheless, the potential for sustainable land use and travel behaviour is not fully exploited. Simple <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> <b>measures,</b> such as providing less private parking spaces, ensuring a fine mix of uses and proximity to public transport can – at least to a small extent – further promote non-motorised and public transport modes and therefore reduce emissions due to motorised private transport in urban areas...|$|R

40|$|Food {{insecurity}} threatens {{communities across}} the Tamilnadu States, characterized by environmental degradation, decreasing agricultural land, rising social inequities, skewed communities, and public health issues. Urban agriculture provides an opportunity to counteract food system problems and empower individuals. Urban agriculture is broadly defined as food production in urban spaces. Despite its benefits, urban agriculture is threatened by institutional barriers. Urban agriculture is not fully supported by municipal laws and policies, making it vulnerable and impermanent. Therefore, developing and implementing planning policies, laws, and programs to support urban agriculture will establish its practices and support its benefits. Research focuses on broad policies, comprehensive plans, zoning ordinances, and organizational infrastructure. Samples are drawn from cities across the Tamilnadu States, including San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, Cleveland, Seattle, and Chicago.

However, {{it is not an}} easy task to improve the competitiveness of public transport with only traditional system internal measures, e. g. fares, vehicle design, comfort, safety. There is a strong assumption that efficient public transport systems demand a supportive and integrated <b>urban</b> <b>planning.</b> <b>Measures</b> such as car restrictions, traffic priorities, high densities in residential areas, "anti-sprawl" policies etc, are important if the target is to create a more competitive alternative to the private car in urban settings. In Sweden there is a growing awareness at the national political level that integrated <b>planning</b> is a <b>measure</b> that must be used to reach the targets associated with the very ambitious environmental policy.

In the Swedish middle-sized city of Norrköping, an extension of the already existing tramway network was explored in the project. The extension was conceptualised as a transport solution and a city renewal project, bringing new life and economic vitality to older city districts. The results clearly indicate that integrated planning, i. e. combining traffic and town planning, is a tool with a very strong capability to change the present situation in cities into something substantially different. But this can not be done without a far-reaching reorganisation and an institutional renewal of local planning and policy procedures, which includes the relations between local, regional and national levels in the political and planning system...|$|R
40|$|A deeper {{understanding}} of extreme hot weather are needed in cities sensitive to heat effects, an investigation {{was done in the}} tropical town of Kaohsiung in Taiwan. Its 11 districts were divided into three climatic classes varying from high urban heat, low levels of green space and lack of proximity to water bodies to low urban heat, adequate green space and proximity to water bodies. Daily data on natural mortality, meteorological variables, and pollutants from May-October 1999 - 2008 were analysed using generalised additive models for the time-series data. Subgroup analyses were conducted, stratifying decedents according to the level of planning activity required in order to mitigate adverse heat effects in their residential areas, classifying districts as “level 1 ” for those requiring a high level of mitigation action; “level 2 ” for those requiring some action; and “level 3 ” for those that need only preserve existing conditions. Stratified analyses showed that mortality increases per 1 °C rise on average, either on the same day or in the previous 4 days (lags 0 - 4), were associated with 2. 8 %, 2. 3 % and - 1. 3 % for level 1, 2 and 3 districts, respectively. The slope describing the association between temperature and mortality was higher above 29. 0 °C resulting in corresponding increases of 4. 2 %, 5. 0 % and 0. 3 % per per 1 °C rise in temperature, respectively.

It is concluded that hot season mortality in Kaohsiung is only sensitive to heat effects in districts classified as having unfavourably climatic conditions and requiring mitigation efforts in city <b>planning.</b> <b>Urban</b> <b>planning</b> <b>measures</b> designed to improve climatic conditions could reduce excess mortality resulting from extreme hot weathe...|$|R

Because of their high population density, overheated cities are particularly strongly affected by heat stress. In the future, due to the effects of climate change, heat stress will increase in terms of its intensity and spatial expansion in the areas of concern.

A scenario of the future increase of heat stress events is presented, based on data of the German climate change model STAR II. For the identification of areas requiring adaptation and protection, spatial analyses of the urban heat island, land use and demographic aspects were performed using GIS tools.

40|$|In <b>urban</b> <b>planning,</b> both <b>measuring</b> and {{communicating}} sustainability {{are among the}} most recent concerns. Therefore, the primary emphasis of this thesis concerns establishing metrics and visualization techniques {{in order to deal with}} indicators of sustainability. First, this thesis provides a novel approach for measuring and monitoring two indicators of sustainability - urban sprawl and carbon footprints – at the urban neighborhood scale. By designating different sectors of relevant carbon emissions as well as different household categories, this thesis provides detailed information about carbon emissions in order to estimate impacts of daily consumption decisions and travel behavior by household type. Regarding urban sprawl, a novel gridcell-based indicator model is established, based on different dimensions of urban sprawl. Second, this thesis presents a three-step-based visualization method, addressing predefined requirements for geovisualizations and visualizing those indicator results, introduced above. This surface-visualization combines advantages from both common GIS representation and three-dimensional representation techniques within the field of <b>urban</b> <b>planning,</b> and is assisted by a web-based graphical user interface which allows for accessing the results by the public. In addition, by focusing on local neighborhoods, this thesis provides an alternative approach in measuring and visualizing both indicators by utilizing a Neighborhood Relation Diagram (NRD), based on weighted Voronoi diagrams. Thus, the user is able to a) utilize original census data, b) compare direct impacts of indicator results on the neighboring cells, and c) compare both indicators of sustainability visually. ...|$|R

The case study developed a light transferability approach, which uses a low level of expert input and data requirements, and is thus appropriate for cities with highly limited financial resources. The case study focussed upon regulatory measures that are under the control of the local authority, and also identified possible barriers and facilitators for their implementation. It was generally considered that the ‘light’ transferability approach had been successful and could be used in many other ‘smaller’ cities. The paper provides insights both for research and transport planning practice (on identifying barriers, and hence solutions, for the successful implementation of urban freight transport measures). Furthermore, the paper provides a number of reflections about the transfer process, paying particular attention to the precise objectives of such exercises and the roles of transfer agents.

40|$|The {{physical}} environment {{plays a major}} role in facilitating people’s activity patterns in residential settings. The ways in which people conceive of their neighborhood as a space and a place for activities has theoretical implications for exploring the relationships between environmental factors and pedestrian behavior and physical activity. An elaboration of existing theories of space and place combines these two constructs into a single framework useful for describing and studying the {{physical environment}}. It is suggested that patterns of place and configurational aspects of space both encourage walking and physical activity. The empirical section of this dissertation investigates the relationships of destination, space syntax, and <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> <b>measures</b> with pedestrian movement and physical activity outcomes. This work draws on data from the Healthy Environments Partnership (HEP), a research initiative that focuses on the contributions of the environment to health outcomes in three Detroit neighborhoods. Data were obtained from a household survey of 919 respondents, neighborhood observations, parcel level land use records, and the US census. The physical activity outcome data comes from the survey and is directly connected to neighborhood residents, while the neighborhood observations of pedestrian movement include both residents and visitors. Multilevel and OLS regression analyses were used to test the relative predictive strength of the three types of environmental factors on two sets of outcomes: pedestrian movement (+ sedentary behavior) and physical activity (and waist circumference). Psychosocial perceptions were also analyzed as possible mediating factors. Findings show that the three types of measures are associated with pedestrian movement, with destination measures being the most related; fewer associations were found with waist circumference and physical activity. Perceptions of the psychosocial environment were not found to mediate the main effects. New environmental measures developed for this research offer new ways to conceptualize the built environment. The findings related to psychosocial factors, the importance of destination measures, and the theoretical distinction made between physical activity and pedestrian movement may be useful constructs in the design process. This dissertation suggests that approaches emphasizing environmental patterns rather than discrete environmental variables should be considered in future research...|$|R

In this paper, a multi-objective model was constructed to discuss the problem, including economic benefits and ecological effectiveness, in terms of land use optimization.

Results showed that a set of tradeoffs could be acquired by the allocation of land use. In addition, the Pareto solutions proved the model to be efficient; for example, a limit of 13, 500 ha of urban area conformed to plan recommendations. The reduction in crop land, orchard land, grassland, and unused land provided further efficiencies.

In order to achieve this objective, this paper reviews qualitatively the <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> in Iran and assesses its <b>urban</b> development <b>plans.</b> Ultimately, appropriate <b>measures</b> are presented in order to suggest how the defects found in the current Iranian <b>urban</b> development <b>plans</b> may be corrected by employing the lessons learned from practical examples recorded in other selected countries. The primary data was collected by means of semi-structured interviews from decision making and decision taking processes in Iran. In conclusion, this article suggests that the identified defects of <b>urban</b> development <b>plans</b> in Iran may be improved by adapting to the most recent universal concepts of <b>urban</b> <b>planning.</b> In other words, Iranian <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> should be distanced from political decisions and instead motivated as a technical process in the government structure...|$|R

Cities are {{currently}} undergoing a transformation into the Smart concept, like Smartphones or SmartTV. Many initiatives {{are being developed}} {{in the framework of}} the Smart Cities projects, however, {{there is a lack of}} consistent indicators and methodologies to assess, finance, prioritize and implement this kind of projects. Smart Cities projects are classified according to six axes: Government, Mobility, Environment, Economy, People and Living. (Giffinger, 2007) The main objective of this research is to develop an evaluation model in relation to the mobility concept as one of the six axes of the Smart City classification and apply it to the Spanish cities. The evaluation was carried out in the 62 cities that made up in September 2015 the Spanish Network of Smart Cities (RECI- Red Española de Ciudades Inteligentes). This research is part of a larger project about Smart Cities’ evaluation (+CITIES), the project evaluates RECI’s cities in all the axes. The analysis was carried out taking into account sociodemographic indicators such as the size of the city or the municipal budget per inhabitant. The mobility’s evaluation in those cities has been focused in: sustainability mobility <b>urban</b> <b>plans</b> and <b>measures</b> to reduce the number of vehicles. The 62 cities from the RECI have been evaluated according to their degree of progress in several Smart Cities’ initiatives related to smart mobility. The applied methodology has been specifically made for this project. The grading scale has different ranks depending on the deployment level of smart cities’ initiatives...|$|R
