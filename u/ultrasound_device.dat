30|$|This novice {{handheld}} device represents {{only one of}} {{what appears to be}} a growing number of new ultra-portable <b>ultrasound</b> <b>devices</b> on the market. These devices represent a new and exciting form of ultrasound technology that may benefit patients and physicians in multiple venues. While they are unlikely to replace standard <b>ultrasound</b> <b>devices</b> for many of the more complex applications, their extreme portability allows for ultrasound imaging in more diverse situations that has previously been practical. Based on our limited experience, the image quality is adequate and the learning curve is reasonable. Future integration of PDA technology could further the utility of these devices and additional study will be important to further define their appropriate niche and clinical utility.|$|R
5000|$|An {{ultrasound}} research interface (URI) is {{a software}} tool loaded onto a diagnostic clinical <b>ultrasound</b> <b>device</b> which provides functionality beyond typical clinical modes of operation. Before an ultrasound image can be displayed to the user, it must undergo {{a series of}} transformations, typically {{referred to as the}} ultrasound processing chain. As data moves through the processing chain, it may be desirable to acquire it at certain intervals, so it can be processed offline for research purposes. A set of processing parameters sent to the <b>ultrasound</b> <b>device</b> control how the processing chain performs its operations. It may also be desirable to change these processing parameters to achieve different imaging results. A clinical ultrasound user only has access to the ultrasound data in its final processed form, referred to as a B-Mode image. The format of the images are typically in the DICOM file format. The clinical user also has limited access to the processing parameters that can be modified; for reasons of device usability, and so the device cannot be put into a state that renders itself inoperable.|$|E
50|$|Eppendorf {{was founded}} in 1945 by Heinrich Netheler and Hans Hinz in the Hamburg {{district}} of Eppendorf {{on the grounds of}} the University Medical Center, originally as a workshop for medical devices. Dr Netheler and Dr Hinz used their extensive knowledge of radar technology to develop both the first <b>ultrasound</b> <b>device</b> and the stimulator, a machine used for diagnosing and therapeutically treating muscle and nerve damage. They also invented an electrical thermometer (the “Thermorapid”) that, for the first time, enabled body temperature to be measured in just a few seconds.|$|E

50|$|Acoustic waves {{emitted by}} ultrasonics {{transducer}} crystals exhibit a property known as self-focusing (or natural focusing).

50|$|Rodents {{adjust to}} the {{ultrasound}} (or any new sound) and eventually ignore it. At best, ultrasonic waves have only a partial or temporary effect on rodents. Numerous studies have rejected ultrasonic sound as a practical means of rodent control in favor of rat traps or rat-catcher. Tests of commercial ultrasonic devices have indicated that rodents may be repelled from the immediate area of the <b>ultrasound</b> <b>device</b> {{for a few minutes}} to a few days, but they will nearly always return and resume normal activities. Other tests have shown that the degree of repellance depends on the frequency, intensity, and pre-existing condition of the rodent infestation. The intensity of such sounds must be so great that damage to humans or domestic animals would also be likely; commercial ultrasonic pest control devices do not produce sounds of such intensity.|$|E
50|$|Remote guidance, in {{the medical}} context, refers to the {{supervision}} or guidance of a medical task, usually a procedures or test, from a remote location. This falls {{in the realm of}} real time telemedicine applications. By way of example, a radiologist may guide an ultrasound examination from a remote location. As such the proximate requisite expertise to accomplish a medical task is significantly diminished. In the previous example, a diagnostic quality ultrasound can be accomplished by non-medically trained individuals manipulating an <b>ultrasound</b> <b>device</b> located with the patient under guidance from a remote location. This is an example of teleradiology If appropriately configured, the remote guidance can originate from another room or floor in the same building, to as far away as another continent or even planet. NASA researchers have successfully demonstrated remote guidance of diagnostic level cardiac ultrasonography using an ultrasound on the space station, non-medical astronauts performing the exam as guided by a terrestrially located expert.|$|E
50|$|Since the suprascapular nerve {{provides}} {{sensory information}} to 70% {{of the joint}} capsule, blocking this nerve can help with post-operative shoulder pain. A nerve stimulator, <b>ultrasound</b> <b>device,</b> or a needle insertion that is 1 cm above {{the midpoint of the}} scapular spine can quickly block the suprascapular nerve. Furthermore, blocking the axillary nerve together with the suprascapular nerve can further anesthetize the shoulder joint. The benefit of the suprascapular nerve block is that it avoids blocking motor function to parts of the upper limb innervated by the more inferior roots of the brachial plexus (C8-T1), which thus prevents the phrenic nerve from being blocked. Disadvantages to the suprascapular nerve block include using two separate needlings, blocking not all of nerves of the shoulder joint, and short duration of action. Some side effects for the procedure include pneumothorax, intravascular injection, and nerve damage. Although this technique provides more pain control compared to placebo, the technique is still inferior to the interscalene block.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Objective: The first aim of {{the study}} was to make an {{inventory}} of the currently available <b>ultrasound</b> imaging <b>devices</b> on the market. The second aim was to identify portable <b>ultrasound</b> <b>devices</b> which could be used in general dental offices to image salivary glands, masticatory muscles and lymph nodes. Material and Methods: A list of ultrasound de-vices was collected from 11 international and American manufacturers using company websites and ultrasound retailer’s websites using the search engine Google. Results: A total of 86 ultrasound machines from 11 different manufacturers were identified, of which only 14 devices are portable. Transducers are usually transferrable between devices of the same brand, and the non-portable machines have multiple transducer ports (three or four), while portable machines typically have only one or two ports. Portable machine weights range from 10 to 20 pounds, and often resemble large laptops, which are convenient to carry and take up minimal space in clinics. Conclusion: Some manufacturers provide portable and non-portable <b>ultrasound</b> <b>devices.</b> The first ones could be valuable in dental settings, as they can easily be moved around in the office...|$|R
50|$|In 1965 the Strasburg Rail Road in Strasburg, Pennsylvania, leased No. 1223 {{from the}} Pennsylvania Railroad and {{restored}} it to operating condition. In the 1970s and 1980s, the 1223 pulled the Strasburg's regular tourist trains, {{as well as}} occasional offline excursion trips, often running in tandem with PRR 7002. During the 1970s, the Penn Central had transferred the Pennsylvania Railroad historical collection to the State of Pennsylvania, which placed much of the collection {{on display at the}} newly built Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania, just across the road from the Strasburg Rail Road's depot complex. As such, ownership of the 1223, as well as the 7002, was turned over to the museum, from which the Strasburg continued to lease and operate both engines. In 1989, Strasburg's newly acquired <b>ultrasound</b> <b>device</b> revealed that the firebox walls of both 1223 and 7002 were not thick enough to comply with the updated Federal Railroad Administration regulations, thus deeming the engines unsafe for operation. The Strasburg declined to make the necessary repairs as the engines did not belong to them. Moreover, the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania preferred to keep the original fabric of their equipment intact. Thus, Strasburg withdrew the engines from service {{at the end of the}} 1989 season, and allowed their leases to expire, at which time they were placed on display inside the museum, where they currently remain.|$|E
50|$|One {{characteristic}} of ultrasound previously discussed {{is that of}} attenuation of an ultrasound signal {{partly due to the}} conversion of mechanical wave energy to thermal energy. Researchers and doctors have made medical applications to harness this heat conversion and use it in successful medical procedures. Ultrasound energy is a form of therapy being studied as an anticancer treatment. Intensified ultrasound energy can be directed at cancer cells to heat them and kill them. Recent testing has shown that ultrasound can increase the effectiveness of cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy. This procedure is known as heat or hyperthermia therapy. By using the converted heat energy that ultrasound provides, specific diseased tissues can be heated often to temperatures around 41° to 45°C. This increase in temperature has been linked to improved effectiveness of cancer treatment due to dilation of blood vessels and increased oxygen presence in affected tissues.Another new treatment called HIFU (High Intensity Focused Ultrasound) takes advantage of the thermal energy characteristics of ultrasound. HIFU uses an <b>ultrasound</b> <b>device</b> that is able to precisely focus ultrasound waves at a target tissue or specific group of cells. At the focus of this ultrasound energy, the temperature can reach excesses of 80°C which results in nearly spontaneous coagulative necrosis or cell death without harming neighboring cells. This treatment greatly expands the ability of doctors to be able to destroy cancer cells noninvasively. Currently, many test are being carried out to determine the effectiveness of the treatment on different tissues, but testing has already shown promising results in the field of prostate cancer.|$|E

40|$|Background: Previous {{studies show}} that {{ultrasound}} is valid and reliable when measuring muscle size. A Philips handheld <b>ultrasound</b> <b>device</b> was released in April 2015. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the validity and reliability of the handheld <b>ultrasound</b> <b>device</b> compared to a conventional <b>ultrasound</b> <b>device,</b> when measuring the size of the rectus femoris (RF). Methods: Two sonographers scanned 39 volunteers (mean age= 29. 3 y, 26 female), once with the Toshiba SSA- 660 A (regular) <b>ultrasound</b> <b>device</b> and twice with the Philips hand held VISIQ device. The size of the RF (expressed in cross sectional area (CSA) was measured two ways; using the trackball on the Toshiba device and an automatic region of interest on the VISIQ device (method 1), and an ellipse on both devices using the formula π*half width*half length (method 2). Results: Method 1 resulted in an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of. 811 with a 95 % (confidence interval) CI of. 773 -. 837 (inter-rater reliability) and. 907 with a 95 % CI of. 822 -. 951 (validity). The ICCs of method 2 were. 787 with a 95 % CI of. 593 -. 888 (inter-rater reliability) and. 867 with a 95 % CI of. 746 -. 930 (validity). Conclusion: VISIQ is a valid and reliable device for measuring RF-CSA.

40|$|Echocardiograms are {{the result}} of {{utilizing}} <b>ultrasound</b> <b>devices</b> to capture cardiac structures and dynamics. The results of these scans, which are depicted as video or images, are assessed by physicians to determine heart conditions. Although <b>ultrasound</b> <b>devices</b> are making way into diverse medical scenarios, their utility has been hampered by the need for extensive operator training to perform examinations, and medical experience required for analysing imagery. Telesonography or tele-ultrasound, allows for the guidance and interpretation of ultrasound acquisitions by distant medical experts. Since video content sharing necessitates large amounts of bandwidth, encoding techniques can be applied beforehand {{to reduce the size of}} exchanged data. This paper introduces a healthcare solution that aims to support the encoding and compression of medical imagery. The proposed application combines several image processing techniques with ROI video coding algorithms to achieve optimal size and quality trade-offs.

40|$|Introduction The {{objective}} {{of our study}} was to establish, through retrospective analysis of sonographic findings obtained by portable <b>ultrasound</b> <b>devices,</b> the frequency of pathological findings of the gallbladder and common bile duct in a randomized group of patients with infectious diseases. Material and methods During five years (January 1, 2000 - December 31, 2004), gallbladder and common bile duct were examined by ultrasonography in 2691 adult patients (1440 males and 1251 females), mean age 48 ± 17 years, ranging from 17 to 92 years at the Institute of Infectious and Tropical Diseases in Belgrade. The examination included the measurement of {{size and shape of}} the gallbladder, its wall and lumen, as well as measurement of caliber and content of the common bile duct. Conventional portable <b>ultrasound</b> <b>devices,</b> ALOKA SSD- 500 and SSD- 1000 (B-mod) with convex 3. 5 and 5 MHz probes were used. Results The cholecyst was normal in size (< 120 x 50 mm) in 2164 (80. 4 %), and enlarged in 65 (2. 4 %) patients. The gallbladder was surgically removed in 163 (6. 1 %) patients, it was pseudoseptal in 141 (5. 2 %) and invisible in 44 (1. 6 %) patients. The gallbladder wall was normal in 2031 (75. 5 %), thickened in 259 (9. 6 %) and edematous in 173 (6. 4 %). Gallbladder calculosis was present in 310 (11. 5 %), and choledocholithiasis in 13 (0. 5 %) patients. Conclusion Development of morphological abnormalities of the gallbladder and common bile duct was frequent in non-selected patients with infectious diseases. The majority of them may be detected by portable <b>ultrasound</b> <b>devices,</b> which makes them rather applicable for large clinical-epidemiological studies...|$|R
