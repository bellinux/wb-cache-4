2500|$|FairTax {{supporters}} {{assert that}} the proposal would make the cost of federal government highly visible as consumers would see most of this cost in a single tax paid every time they purchase a good or service. Under the current tax system, the federal government collects revenue through {{a wide variety of}} taxes on individuals and businesses. Thus the cost of government is spread out among many different avenues and may not be fully visible to individual citizens. For example, corporate taxes and compliance costs are passed partially from producers to final consumers when producers include those costs in the retail price of goods and services. The <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> tax withholding has also reduced the visibility of taxes. The U.S. Department of Treasury describes (in the history of the income tax) that withholding [...] "greatly reduced the taxpayer's awareness of the amount of tax being collected, i.e. it reduced the transparency of the tax, which made it easier to raise taxes in the future." [...] Proponents claim that the FairTax would greatly reduce, if not eliminate, the [...] "K Street tax lobbyist's" [...] ability to influence legislators to manipulate the U.S. tax code for the benefit of their clients. The FairTax legislation does not prevent future changes by Congress, however, due to the transparency of the FairTax, the American people would be aware of changes to the tax base from exemptions because a change in tax rate would likely be reflected. [...] Congressman John Linder, the bill sponsor, is considering adding language to H.R. 25 during the 111th Congress that would require a supermajority vote of Congress to exempt any industry from the tax.|$|E

For {{each of the four}} sectors (the rest of the world does not have a production account), the balancing item, gross value added, is shown as output less intermediate consumption.Gross value added at basic prices for each sector differs from gross domestic product for the UK total economy. The difference occurs because taxes less subsidies on products are not included in the production account by sector and are instead included within resources for the UK total economy. The sum of gross value added and taxes less subsidies on products for the UK economy is equal to GDP at market prices.The distribution and <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> accounts exist for all the institutional sectors.

Gross operating surplus is therefore the income which units obtain from their own use of the production facilities.|$|E
