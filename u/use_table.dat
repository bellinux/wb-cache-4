50|$|Based on {{the reviews}} and presentations {{available}} on the web, the overall reception of RedBeanPHP seems to be positive. However the library is less suitable for projects with existing databases and does not support custom table and column mappings, for instance {{it is not possible}} to <b>use</b> <b>table</b> prefixes.

These data have been produced at the Belgian Federal Planning Bureau {{within the framework of}} the EUKLEMS project and constitute an input for the project's productivity database. The compilation of the time series was based on national accounts data and existing supply and <b>use</b> <b>tables.</b> The methodology consisted in splitting several industries and products, adapting existing data to the latest national accounts revisions, estimating missing tables as well as deflating current price supply and <b>use</b> <b>tables.</b> Supply and <b>use</b> <b>tables...</b>|$|R

50|$|If the {{claimant}} has a recurring loss {{over a period}} of say 15 years, then <b>use</b> <b>Table</b> 28 looking up 15 in the first column and then across to the 2.5% column which gives a multiplier of 12.54. If the loss does not start until some time in the future, then you can combine Table 27 and Table 28 to give an overall multiplier. For example a loss {{over a period of}} 15 years that starts in 10 years time would have a Table 27 multiplier of 0.7812 and a Table 28 multiplier of 12.54 giving an overall multiplier of 9.80.|$|E
50|$|Uncle Man tears paper {{according}} {{to the order of}} strokes of the word. He practices by adding symmetrical features to words, figures and even three-dimensional words. In fact, in order to promote paper-tearing skills, he made a lot of effort to decrease the number of steps and have fun at the same time, so that even a two-year-old child can both learn and enjoy making them. He usually uses recycled paper for his artwork in the hopes of protecting the environment and making paper-tearing popularized. For instance, he teaches children to <b>use</b> <b>table</b> mats of fast food shops to make paper-tearing works; therefore, children can make artwork without wasting paper.|$|E

So for a 45 years old female, using Table 2 you would look down the first column to find 45 and then across to the 0% column which gives a figure of 43.93. In cases where the age is not a whole number, i.e. female who is 45.75 years, then you use the figure for 45 years (43.93) and the figure for 46 years (42.87) and interpolate between the two (46-45.75) x 43.93 + (45.75-45) x 42.87 to give 43.14 years.|$|E
50|$|Table squash is a {{sport for}} two players {{which is an}} {{evolution}} of table tennis and uses similar rules and equipment. The game is played by placing a table tennis table against a playing wall with the net remaining on the table perpendicular to the wall. Each player stands {{on the opposite side}} of the table facing the wall on either side of an imaginary line as if the net was extended backwards. Players each <b>use</b> <b>table</b> tennis rackets and take turns to play a table tennis ball off the playing wall onto the table on the opponents side of the net, except on serves where the ball must first bounce on the servers side of the net on the table.|$|E
5000|$|The {{score that}} is {{computed}} will {{fall in the}} range of 0-25% if the range is in [...] "Poor" [...] Condition, 26-50% if the range is in [...] "Fair" [...] Condition, 51-75% if the range is in [...] "Good" [...] Condition, and 76-100% if the range is in [...] "Excellent" [...] Condition.By taking the range condition score that is determined, the researcher then can <b>use</b> <b>Table</b> 4 in the Nebraska Cooperative Extension Circular EC 86-113-C to determine an [...] "Adjustment Factor for Initial Stocking Rate." [...] This adjustment factor is then multiplied with the correct number found in Table 3 of the same Extension Circular to determine an initial stocking rate value for livestock. This stocking rate is expressed in units called AUM/acre (Animal Unit Months per acre). AUMs are based on the amount of forage that a 1000-pound animal will graze in one month's time, which is roughly 780 pounds of air-dry forage. This information is further detailed in the [...] "Nebraska Handbook of Range Management" [...] (EC 92-124-E by Reece and Stubbendieck).By connecting the research completed involving quantifying rangeland health to the research completed involving livestock grazing and distribution, we now have a system in place to more properly manage stocking rates of grazing livestock. In addition, we have a system that determines the amount of forage that should not be grazed to provide adequate support for wildlife biodiversity. This use, as well as others, is detailed below.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the integrated project EXIOPOL (A New Environmental Accounting Framework Using Externality Data and Input-Output Tools for Policy Analysis) {{is to set up}} a multi regional environmentally extended input-output database. Consistent supply and <b>use</b> <b>tables</b> of the EU 27 countries and 16 selected Rest of the World countries will form the input to this database. For European countries consistent input-output tables are available, based on the European System of Accounts (ESA 95). Supply and <b>use</b> <b>tables</b> are, however, not available for every EU country. National Statistical Institutes of RoW countries have in most cases only Input-Output tables available. Besides creating more detail in the supply and <b>use</b> <b>tables</b> to meet the 130 products and sectors used in EXIOPOL, a method has to be developed to work backwards from an Input-Output table to a Supply and Use structure. This paper presents the transformation steps needed to align the Supply and <b>Use</b> <b>tables</b> of the EU 27 countries and 16 RoW countries. The focus will be on: methodology and assumptions needed to construct compatible Supply and <b>Use</b> <b>tables</b> out of Input-Output tables; solving problems with data valuation; and disaggregation methods to create more sector- and product detail. Because there are differences in data availability for each country, the transformation process will differ per country. Practical experiences with the conversion of tables for EXIOPOL will be presented in this paper...|$|R
5000|$|Desperate {{to atone}} for the {{previous}} year's debacle, Network Ten replaced Gretel Killeen and Daniel MacPherson with Kim Watkins (host of 9am with David and Kim at the Sydney Opera House) and Andrew Günsberg (host of Australian Idol at Dawes Point) respectively. The Dawes Point reporter was Fuzzy from Video Hits. The celebrations kicked off with The Potbelleez performing [...] "Don't Hold Back". After that, a recording was done, which showed a scientist predicting what {{the world would be}} like in the year 2050, which would be affected by global warming. The presenters at the Royal Botanic Gardens were Wesley Denning from Totally Wild, Pip Russell (dressed as Alice in Wonderland) and Dan Sweetman (dressed as a white rabbit) from Toasted TV and Dr. Rob Bell from Scope (who was the only one not in fancy dress), as the theme for the Lord Mayor's Picnic was [...] "Once Upon a Time". It included face painting, Wesley Denning dressed as Prince Charming to wake up Pip Russell who was playing Sleeping Beauty with a kiss. Denning said the fairytales are about [...] "magic" [...] which is what Pip said about the fireworks, but Dr. Rob begged to differ on that, stating that fireworks are scientific. He did a recording on it. He started off with saying that fireworks [...] "come from a range of different colours, all of which are due to the excited states of different metal atoms". He decided to take a salt that contains a metal, opting to <b>use</b> <b>table</b> salt, because it's sodium chloride. The flame was blue, but it became an orange colour, because [...] "all of the sodium atoms in there are getting really, really excited". He tried a copper one, which made the flame a green colour. He said fireworks work on the same principle as a match. It is a chemical reaction called [...] "combustion". He lit the match. He also said that fireworks don't use wood as a fuel, but they use charcoal and sulphur. To do his own demonstration, he used sugar as a fuel, {{in the form of a}} jelly baby. For oxygen, he said you can't use air with a match because [...] "it just doesn't create big enough explosions". So instead, he used chemicals called oxidiser that contain lots of oxygen. So he held a test tube (which had the sugar at the bottom) by the tweezers and rolled the jelly baby in the sugar (not the one in the test tube) and eventually he combined them. He put the jelly baby in the test tube, which triggered a chemical reaction. That was the end of the recording. After the commercial break, Tarisai Vushe, Ben McKenzie and Jacob Butler all performed, then the three of them performed [...] "Dancing in the Moonlight". After the commercial break, Andrew Günsberg handed proceedings to Wes, Pip, Dan and Dr. Rob at the Lord Mayor's Picnic to lead the countdown. Dr. Rob stated that in the ten seconds it takes to count down to the fireworks, an object, travelling at the speed of light, could go around the Earth seventy times. Then they led the countdown and the fireworks started off in style, starting off with [...] "What Time Is It?" [...] from High School Musical 2.|$|E

Bureau of Economic Analysis’ {{integration}} initiative (Yuskavage, 2000; Moyer et al., 2004 a, 2004 b; Lawson et al., 2006), the Industry Accounts Directorate {{is drawing}} upon the Stone method (Stone et al., 1942) and Chen (2006) to reconcile the gross operating surplus component of value-added from the 2002 expenditure-based benchmark input-output accounts and the 2002 income-based gross domestic product-by-industry accounts. The objective of the reconciliation is to use information regarding the relative reliabilities of underlying data in both the benchmark input-output <b>use</b> <b>table</b> and the gross domestic product-by-industry accounts in a balanced input-output framework {{in order to improve}} intermediate input estimates and gross operating surplus estimates in both accounts. Given a balanced input-output framework, the Stone method also provides a tool for balancing the benchmark <b>use</b> <b>table.</b> This paper presents work by the Industry Accounts Directorate to develop and implement the reconciliation and balancing model. The paper provides overviews of the benchmark <b>use</b> <b>table</b> and gross domestic product-by-industry accounts, including features of external source data and adjustment methodologies that are relevant for the reconciliation. In addition, the paper presents the empirical model that the Industry Accounts Directorate is building and briefly describes the technology used to solve the model.
