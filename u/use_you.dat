25|$|His term as rector was brief, though, for on June 9, 1982, he was {{appointed}} coadjutor bishop to the then controversial and prophetic Bishop Francisco Claver, of Diocese of Malaybalay, Bukidnon. In this moment of difficulty, Rosales recalled that a stampita (holy picture) dropped from his breviary (liturgy of the hours). It was from Mother (now Blessed) Teresa of Calcutta. When he picked it up, he saw the writing at the back. It read: “Allow God to <b>use</b> <b>you</b> without first consulting you.” These words brought peace to his soul. On September 14, 1984, Rosales succeeded the Bishop of Malaybalay taking complete authority over the diocese. He started his ministry in Malaybalay by forming with his people, especially the priest and religious there, {{a vision of the}} diocese: that of the total development of every person and all persons, brought about by Jesus Christ. In that difficult assignment, he was able to bring about the unity of the clergy as they struggled especially for justice, peace and environmental protection. He often looks back to his days there as the golden moments of his ministry.|$|E
500|$|Johnson gained {{high office}} {{due to his}} proven record as a man popular among the small farmers and {{self-employed}} tradesmen who made up much of Tennessee's electorate. He called them the [...] "plebeians"; he was less popular among the planters and lawyers who led the state Democratic Party, but none could match him as a vote-getter. After his death, one Tennessee voter wrote of him, [...] "Johnson {{was always the same}} to everyone... the honors heaped upon him did not make him forget to be kind to the humblest citizen." [...] Always seen in impeccably tailored clothing, he cut an impressive figure, and had the stamina to endure lengthy campaigns with daily travel over bad roads leading to another speech or debate. Mostly denied the party's machinery, he relied on a network of friends, advisers, and contacts. One friend, Hugh Douglas, stated in a letter to him, [...] "you have been in the way of our would be great men for a long time. At heart many of us never wanted you to be Governor only none {{of the rest of us}} Could have been elected at the time and we only wanted to <b>use</b> <b>you.</b> Then we did not want you to go to the Senate but the people would send you." ...|$|E
500|$|Shaw's {{views on}} {{religion}} and Christianity were less consistent. Having in his youth proclaimed himself an atheist, in middle age he explained this as a reaction against the Old Testament image of a vengeful Jehovah. By the early twentieth century, he termed himself a [...] "mystic", although Gary Sloan, in an essay on Shaw's beliefs, disputes his credentials as such. In 1913 Shaw declared {{that he was not}} religious [...] "in the sectarian sense", aligning himself with Jesus as [...] "a person of no religion". In the preface (1915) to Androcles and the Lion, Shaw asks [...] "Why not give Christianity a chance?" [...] contending that Britain's social order resulted from the continuing choice of Barabbas over Christ. In a broadcast just before the Second World War, Shaw invoked the Sermon on the Mount, [...] "a very moving exhortation, and it gives you one first-rate tip, which is to do good to those who despitefully <b>use</b> <b>you</b> and persecute you". In his will, Shaw stated that his [...] "religious convictions and scientific views cannot at present be more specifically defined than as those of a believer in creative revolution". He requested that no one should imply that he accepted the beliefs of any specific religious organisation, and that no memorial to him should [...] "take the form of a cross or any other instrument of torture or symbol of blood sacrifice".|$|E

500|$|Katzenberg {{moved the}} opening of Antz from spring 1999 to October 1998 to compete with Pixar's release. David Price writes in his 2008 book The Pixar Touch that a rumor, [...] "never confirmed", was that Katzenberg had given PDI [...] "rich {{financial}} incentives to induce them to whatever {{it would take to}} have Antz ready first, despite Pixar's head start". Jobs was furious and called Katzenberg and began yelling. Katzenberg made an offer: He would delay production of Antz if Jobs and Disney would move A Bug’s Life so that it did not compete with The Prince of Egypt. Jobs believed it [...] "a blatant extortion attempt" [...] and would not go for it, explaining that {{there was nothing he could}} do to convince Disney to change the date. Katzenberg casually responded that Jobs himself had taught him how to conduct similar business long ago, explaining that Jobs had come to Pixar's rescue by making the deal for Toy Story, as Pixar was near bankruptcy at that time. [...] "I was the one guy there for you back then, and now you’re allowing them to <b>use</b> <b>you</b> to screw me," [...] Katzenberg said. He suggested that if Jobs wanted to, he could simply slow down production on A Bug’s Life without telling Disney. If he did, Katzenberg said, he would put Antz on hold. Lasseter also claimed Katzenberg had phoned him with the proposition, but Katzenberg denied these charges later.|$|E
500|$|The Duff family {{formed a}} {{janitorial}} services company, Windy City Maintenance Inc., {{one month after}} Daley's inauguration. Bruce DuMont, president of the Museum of Broadcast Communications, said that Daley recommended that Dumont's wife Kathy Osterman, then director of the Mayor's Office of Special Events, award city contracts to Duff family companies. Daley denied steering contracts to the Duffs, {{and said he would}} [...] "look into" [...] the allegations, while stopping short of promising to do so, saying [...] "I don't promise. That's the wrong word to <b>use.</b> <b>You</b> know... promising, promising. We do look into it, yes." [...] In September 2003 a federal investigation led to indictments of Patricia Green Duff, her sons John M. Duff and James Duff, and others on charges they won nearly $100 million in city contracts through the city's set-aside program by misrepresenting their companies as women- and minority-owned. John M. Duff pleaded guilty to 33 counts of racketeering, fraud and other charges on January 10, 2004. A 1978 state law designed by Illinois Democrats gave the Mayor the power to appoint to fill vacancies in the City Council rather than holding special elections, and by 2002 {{more than a third of}} the Council's 50 aldermen were initially appointed by Daley. The [...] Council became even more of a rubber stamp than in Richard J. Daley's terms. In the 18 months from January 12, 2000 to June 6, 2001, only 13 votes in the [...] Council were divided, less than one a month. 32 aldermen supported the mayor 90-100% of the time and another 14 80-89% of the time.|$|E
500|$|Casting Crowns' lead vocalist, Mark Hall, {{commented on}} the lyrical content of the song, stating that: [...] "For believers, in context with our other songs, the {{messages}} are that God wants to <b>use</b> <b>you,</b> He wants you to grow and He wants {{you to have a}} purpose". Hall elaborated that: [...] "There are a trilogy of songs and messages that go together on the album. , “Glorious Day,” and “To Know You.” [...] reminds me to be more intentional about what I do. I {{may not be able to}} get on a plane and fly to China and give out Bibles and preach the gospel, but how can I witness to my co-workers and my friends and my family." [...] The portion of the chorus that says [...] "like voices in the wilderness we're crying out" [...] is a reference to John the Baptist; Hall said that one of his favorite characters in the New Testament was John the Baptist, and commented that [...] "he [...] was so black and white. This is wrong, and this is right. And he was speaking into a grey world, saying black and white things, and it cost him his life". He elaborated on that, commenting that: [...] "Until the whole world hears are the lines and the things that John the Baptist said into a culture that did not want to hear it. And we've got to be in a place in our walk with Jesus that he's filled us to where we step into something that's unpopular and we can speak the truth, but that we can also speak it in love. We've got to live in such a way that I have the purpose that John had".|$|E

Upon Titus' arrival, an {{announcement}} is made; [...] "Patron of virtue, Rome's best champion,/Successful in the battles that he fights,/With honour and with fortune is returned" [...] (ll.65–68). Once Titus has arrived on-stage, it is not long before he too is speaking of honour, virtue and integrity, referring to the family tomb as a [...] "sweet cell of virtue and nobility" [...] (l.93). After Titus chooses Saturninus as Emperor, they praise one another's honour, with Saturninus referring to Titus' [...] "honourable family" [...] (ll.239) and Titus claiming [...] "I hold me highly honoured of your grace" [...] (ll.245). Titus then says to Tamora, [...] "Now, madam, are you prisoner to an Emperor –/To him that for your honour and your state/Will <b>use</b> <b>you</b> nobly and your followers" [...] (ll.258–260).|$|E
2500|$|By {{about half}} mile past Crenshaw Crossing at Moake Crossing, McDowell was already bloodied and limping, {{unable to walk}} any further. A union man told him, [...] "I'm {{going to kill you}} and <b>use</b> <b>you</b> for bait to catch the other men." [...] He and another man grabbed McDowell and led him down a side road. Gunshots were heard, and the rest {{continued}} towards Herrin. A farmer later discovered McDowell's body. He had been shot four times – twice in the stomach, and once each in the chest and head. [...] A car drove up to the procession, and a man came out whom some said they overheard being called [...] "Hugh Willis" [...] and [...] "the president." [...] According to the accounts of surviving captives, Willis said, [...] "Listen, don't you go killing these fellows on a public highway. There are too many women and children and witnesses around to do that. Take them over in the woods and give it to them. Kill all you can." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tommy Lee of Mötley Crüe fame played drums on [...] "Meet the Creeper" [...] and [...] "The Ballad of Resurrection Joe and Rosa Whore". Due {{to various}} {{personal}} and legal struggles, Lee {{was living in}} the studio for a time during the recording of the album. Humphrey was a good friend of Lee's, and had previously worked with his band prior to the production of Hellbilly Deluxe. Zombie later asked Lee to appear on the album, with Lee agreeing to do so. On the collaboration, Lee stated [...] "I went to his house after I got out of jail to stay for a while, and I think I was there about a day or two and they were working on the record downstairs and Scott and Rob were like, 'Dude, Tommy’s upstairs, we should ask him to play.' And they asked me to play and I was like, 'I would love to play right now. I could really <b>use</b> ... <b>you</b> know, just kind of check out, really do some music' and I ended up playing like four tracks or so on the record." [...] Lee is credited as the drummer for [...] "Meet the Creeper" [...] and [...] "The Ballad of Resurrection Joe and Rosa Whore". [...] "Meet the Creeper" [...] was originally referred to as [...] "Creature Core" [...] prior to the release of the album. Danny Lohner provided additional guitar recordings for [...] "Meet the Creeper". Zombie recorded a song titled [...] "Wish It Away" [...] for the album, though it was not included on the final product.|$|E
