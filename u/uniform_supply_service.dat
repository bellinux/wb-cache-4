Like all cadets and midshipmen at the United States service academies, Coast Guard cadets are on active duty in the military and wear uniforms at all times. Cadets receive a monthly stipend to pay for books, uniforms, and other necessities. Cadets receive monthly pay of $1,017.00, as of 2015. From this amount, pay is automatically deducted for the cost of <b>uniforms,</b> books, <b>supplies,</b> <b>services,</b> and other miscellaneous expenses. Cadets only receive a portion of their total pay in cash. Fourth-class to second-class receive monthly stipends of $100, $200, $300, respectively. First-class receive the difference between the pay and outstanding expenses.|$|R

5|$|Because of the academy's congressional {{nomination}} process, {{students come}} from all 50states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, the Mariana Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the US Virgin Islands. The academy is also authorized up to 60international exchange cadets, who undergo the same four-year curriculum as fully integrated members of the Corps of Cadets. Cadets attend the United States Military Academy free of charge, with all tuition and board {{paid for by the}} Army in return for a service commitment of five years of active duty and three years of reserve status upon graduation. Starting {{on the first day of}} a cadet's second class year, non-graduates after that point are expected to fulfill their obligations in enlisted service. Cadets receive a monthly stipend of $1,017.00 for books, uniforms, and other necessities, as of 2015. From this amount, pay is automatically deducted for the cost of <b>uniforms,</b> books, <b>supplies,</b> <b>services,</b> and other miscellaneous expenses. In addition the monthly pay that the remaining amount ranges from $100 to $400 in the first three years, cadets receive meals in the dining halls, and have access to the Internet and a phone in their barracks. The student population was 4,487 cadets for the 2007–2008 academic year. The student body is 15.1% female. Ninety-two percent of entering students re-matriculated for a second year; the four-year graduation rate was 80% and the six-year rate was 81%.|$|R

40|$|Life and {{functioning}} of higher organisms {{depends on the}} continuous supply of metabolites to tissues and organs. What are the requirements on the transport network pervading a tissue to provide a <b>uniform</b> <b>supply</b> of metabolites? We present an analytical scaling argument and numerical simulations on how flow dynamics and network architecture control active spread and <b>uniform</b> <b>supply</b> of metabolites by studying the example of xylem vessels in plants. We identify the fluid inflow rate as the key factor for <b>uniform</b> <b>supply.</b> While at low inflow rates metabolites are already exhausted close to flow inlets, too high inflow flushes metabolites through the network and deprives tissue close to inlets of supply. In between these two regimes, there exists an optimal inflow rate that yields a <b>uniform</b> <b>supply</b> of metabolites. We determine this optimal inflow analytically in quantitative agreement with numerical results. Optimizing network architecture by reducing the supply variance over all network tubes, we identify patterns of tube dilation or contraction that rescue sub-optimal supply for the case of too low or too high inflow rate. Theoretically uncovered rescue responses match observations of network adaptation in plant and but also animal vascular systems. Comment: 9 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|Joint {{economic}} {{lot size}} models for purchasers and vendors are more economical than when considering their inventory problems independently. It requires vendors to have a complete knowledge of their purchaser's demands. In such a situation, the vendor shall manage the supply with comparatively more inventory at its end. The operational cost can further decrease provided supply is in sub-batches and logistics cost does not increase substantially. However, determining the right size for these sub-batches becomes an issue. Sub-batches of varying size may cause planning and control problems, but supply in sub-batches of uniform size will not. In this paper, joint {{economic lot size}} models are presented for the two supply situations, namely staggered <b>supply</b> and <b>uniform</b> <b>supply.</b> Cases are employed that describe the inventory situation of a single vendor supplying an item to a manufacturer that is further processed before it is supplied to the end-user. Using illustrative examples, the comparative advantages of the <b>uniform</b> sub-batch <b>supply</b> over the staggered alternative are investigated. From the analysis, <b>uniform</b> <b>supply</b> models {{are found to be}} comparatively more beneficial and robust than the staggered sub-batch supply.
