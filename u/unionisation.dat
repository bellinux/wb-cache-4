5|$|Bondfield {{had helped}} Mary Macarthur to found the National Federation of Women Workers (NFWW) in 1906. This {{organisation}} {{was dedicated to}} the <b>unionisation</b> of women, and by 1914 had more than 20,000 members. In 1915 Bondfield became NFWW's organising secretary. Together with Macarthur, Phillips and Susan Lawrence, she established the Central Committee for Women's Employment, which organised relief work for the female unemployed. Bondfield's investigations into workers' pay revealed considerable differences between the rates paid to men and to women, even for identical work. Through the NFWW she campaigned for a £1 a week starting minimum wage for women, whatever {{the nature of the}} work, and for equal pay with men for equal work.|$|E
5|$|Conscription was {{introduced}} in Canada during {{the final years of}} the war, which was accompanied by labour shortages, pressures for social change, and the rapid <b>unionisation</b> of the remaining workforce. While concerns about the Central Powers declined, fears grew in government at the end of 1918 that the new Bolshevik government in Russia might be covertly orchestrating a campaign of strikes across Canada. In response the Prime Minister, Robert Borden, created a Public Safety Branch led by the politician Charles Cahan. Cahan envisaged transforming this organisation into a much larger secret service, similar to the Bureau of Investigation in the United States, but he soon fell out with Borden and ultimately resigned.|$|E
25|$|The {{urbanisation}} of the Isle of Dogs {{took place}} in the 19th century following the construction of the West India Docks, which opened in 1802. This heralded the area's most successful period, when it became an important centre for trade. The East India Docks were subsequently opened in 1806, followed by Millwall Dock in 1868. By the 1880s, the casual employment system caused Dock workers to unionise under Ben Tillett and John Burns. This led to a demand for 6d per hour (2.5p), and an end to casual labour in the docks. After a bitter struggle, the London Dock Strike of 1889 was settled with victory for the strikers, and established a national movement for the <b>unionisation</b> of casual workers.|$|E
500|$|These {{conditions}} earned dockers much public sympathy, {{and after}} a bitter struggle, the London Dock Strike of 1889 was settled with victory for the strikers, and established a national movement for the <b>unionisation</b> of casual workers, {{as opposed to the}} craft unions that already existed.|$|E
500|$|Discontent {{amongst the}} {{population}} grew constantly, {{particularly in the}} country's industrialised south. [...] The autumn of 1916 had seen the first <b>unionisation</b> within the iron and steel industries, with trade unions springing up in both Luxembourg City and Esch-sur-Alzette. [...] Despite the war demand, iron production had slumped, leading to greater employment insecurity. [...] In March and April, three independents were elected as deputies from the canton of Esch-sur-Alzette, where the economy was dominated by iron and steel. [...] As independents, these newly elected deputies were the only legislative opposition to the National Union Government.|$|E
500|$|In 1919 Monteux was {{appointed}} chief {{conductor of the}} Boston Symphony Orchestra. The orchestra was going through difficult times; its conductor, Karl Muck, had been forced by anti-German agitation to step down in 1917. Sir Henry Wood turned down the post, and despite press speculation neither Sergei Rachmaninoff nor Arturo Toscanini {{was appointed}}. At least twenty-four players of German heritage had been forced out with Muck, and orchestral morale was low. Shortly before Monteux took up the conductorship the autocratic founder and proprietor of the orchestra, Henry Lee Higginson, died. He had steadfastly resisted <b>unionisation,</b> and after his death a substantial minority of the players resumed the struggle for union recognition. More than thirty players, including two important principals, resigned over the matter. Monteux set about rebuilding the orchestra, auditioning players {{from all kinds of}} musical background, some of whom had not played symphonic music before. By the end of his first season he had restored the orchestra to something approaching its normal complement. He trained the orchestra to a high standard; according to the critic Neville Cardus, Monteux's musicianship [...] "made the Boston Symphony Orchestra the most refined and musical in the world." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{growth of}} the sugar {{industry}} in Queensland in the 1870s led to searching for labourers prepared {{to work in a}} tropical environment. During this time, thousands of [...] "Kanakas" [...] (Pacific Islanders) were brought into Australia as indentured workers. This and related practices of bringing in non-white labour to be cheaply employed was commonly termed [...] "blackbirding" [...] and refers to the recruitment of people through trickery and kidnappings to work on plantations, particularly the sugar cane plantations of Queensland (Australia) and Fiji. In the 1870s and 1880s, the trade union movement began a series of protests against foreign labour.

2500|$|The <b>unionisation</b> {{rate among}} white-collar workers is {{exceptionally}} high in Sweden – since 2008 {{higher than for}} blue-collar workers. In 2016 blue-collar density was 62% and white-collar density 73% (full-time students working part-time excluded). Just before the considerably raised fees to union unemployment funds in January 2007, blue-collar and white-collar union density was the same (77% in 2006). [...] The average union density was the 70% both in 2011, 2012 and 2013. There are two major confederations that organise professionals and other qualified employees: the Swedish Confederation of Professional Employees (Tjänstemännens Centralorganisation or TCO) and the Swedish Confederation of Professional Associations (Sveriges Akademikers Centralorganisation or SACO). They are both independent from Sweden's political parties and never endorse candidates for office in political elections.|$|E
2500|$|After {{leaving the}} seminary, Fernandes moved to Bombay in 1949 {{in search of}} a job. His life was tough in Bombay, and he had to sleep on the streets, until he got a job as a {{proofreader}} for a newspaper. He relates to the beginning of his career by saying, [...] "When I came to Bombay, I used to sleep on the benches of Chowpatty Sands. In {{the middle of the night}} policemen used to come and wake me up and ask me to move on." [...] He came into contact with veteran union leader Placid D'Mello, and the socialist Rammanohar Lohia, who were the greatest influences on his life. Later, he joined the socialist trade union movement. He rose to prominence as a trade unionist and fought for the rights of labourers in small scale service industries such as hotels and restaurants. Emerging as a key figure in the Bombay labour movement in the early 1950s, Fernandes was a central figure in the <b>unionisation</b> of sections of Bombay labour in the 1950s. As a labour organiser, he served many prison terms when his workforce engaged in fights with company goons. He served as a member of the Bombay Municipal Corporation from 1961 to 1968. He won in the civic election in 1961 and, until 1968, continuously raised the problems of the exploited workers in the representative body of the metropolis.|$|E
2500|$|In 1950, the Almanacs were reconstituted as the Weavers, {{named after}} the title of an 1892 play by Gerhart Hauptmann about a workers' strike (which {{contained}} the lines, [...] "We'll stand it no more, come what may!"). They did benefits for strikers at which they sang songs such as 'Talking Union', about the struggles for <b>unionisation</b> of industrial workers such as miners and auto mobile workers. Besides Pete Seeger (performing under his own name), members of the Weavers included charter Almanac member Lee Hays, Ronnie Gilbert, and Fred Hellerman; later Frank Hamilton, Erik Darling, and Bernie Krause serially took Seeger's place. In {{the atmosphere of the}} 1950s red scare, the Weavers' repertoire had to be less overtly topical than that of the Almanacs had been, and its progressive message was couched in indirect language—arguably rendering it even more powerful. The Weavers on occasion performed in tuxedos (unlike the Almanacs, who had dressed informally) and their managers refused to let them perform at political venues. The Weavers' string of major hits began with [...] "On Top of Old Smoky" [...] and an arrangement of Lead Belly's signature waltz, [...] "Goodnight, Irene", which topped the charts for 13 weeks in 1950 and was covered by many other pop singers. On the flip side of [...] "Irene" [...] was the Israeli song [...] "Tzena, Tzena, Tzena". Other Weaver hits included [...] "Dusty Old Dust" [...] ("So Long It's Been Good to Know You" [...] by Woody Guthrie), [...] "Kisses Sweeter Than Wine" [...] (by Hays, Seeger, and Lead Belly), and the South African Zulu song by Solomon Linda, [...] "Wimoweh" [...] (about Shaka), among others.|$|E

He argued that the <b>unionisation</b> approach by African mine workers was an effective non-violent approach of fighting for their rights through collective bargaining. He endeavoured, with help from Archdeacon Owen, to bring awareness, to the sympathetic Britons, {{the plight of the}} native Africans; the plight brought about by the Kakamega Gold Rush of 1930-52. His efforts and others akin to it were deemed by colonial authorities as antigovernment sedition or rabblerousing and were posthaste outlawed.|$|E
50|$|Unlike other {{political}} organisations, labour unions don't participate in elections {{although they may}} lobby on behalf of parties supporting their positions. Labour <b>unionisation</b> is essentially a simple way for workers to maintain unity and preserve their rights. Often, major corporations antagonise the principle of labour <b>unionisation</b> since it results in heavier employment regulations which restrict the powers of big business to fire workers at will, effectively causing economic difficulties for such companies.|$|E
