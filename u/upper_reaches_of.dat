5|$|The {{streams and}} lakes around Adams offer {{a number of}} fish for the angler to seek out. The two most common species, eastern brook trout and rainbow trout (Columbia River redband trout), are in nearly every lake and stream. Brown trout and {{cutthroat}} trout appear {{in most of the}} lakes in the High Lakes Area and three lakes are home to tiger trout. All the lakes in the High Lakes Area are periodically replanted with varying species of trout. Bull trout {{can be found in the}} <b>upper</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> the Klickitat and Lewis Rivers. Westslope cutthroat trout can be found the Klickitat and cutthroat trout are found in the Lewis River and <b>upper</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> the Cispus River. Whitefish can be found in the Klickitat, Lewis, and Cispus Rivers. Because of barriers to fish passage (dams on the Lewis and Cowlitz Rivers, falls on the White Salmon River), the only river where anadromous fishes can reach the streams around Adams is the Klickitat River. Chinook salmon, coho salmon, and steelhead, in several different runs, make for the <b>upper</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> the Klickitat, including those around Adams, every year.|$|E

5|$|In 1990, the {{population}} {{density of the}} <b>upper</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> the watershed of Little Catawissa Creek was 30 people per square kilometer.

5|$|Little Catawissa Creek is {{considered}} by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to be a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery between its headwaters and Reservoir Road. Between Reservoir Road and {{the mouth of the}} creek, it {{is considered}} to be a Coldwater Fishery. The <b>upper</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> the creek, between its headwaters and a point slightly downstream of where it enters Schuylkill County are considered by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission to be Class A Wild Trout Waters and the rest of the creek's length is considered to be Approved Trout Waters. The <b>upper</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>of</b> the creek were Class A Wild Trout Waters in 1976 before becoming Class D Wild Trout Waters in 1984. This change was due to acid mine drainage and sediment buildup. However, the creek rebounded to Class A Wild Trout Waters by 1997. The creek is considered to be Class D Wild Trout Waters between T431 and T435. The tributary Trexler Run is also considered to be Class A Wild Trout Waters throughout its length.|$|E
5|$|Maribojoc {{had five}} {{intricately}} carved Neo-Gothic retablos {{in the sanctuary}} and transepts. Striking features of the retablo were the presence of arches, crockets, Mudéjar stars and the profusion of carving.
