5|$|The Court {{made clear}} that the {{interests}} of children should be assumed to be covered as part of the interests of the parent, not treated as separate, but this doctrine has been less clear in practice as termination proceedings still focus on the fitness of the parent. This has resulted in further constitutional protections for parents and increasingly formal termination proceedings that limit the contribution of the child's interests in the proceedings. Santosky has also contributed to the role of parental rights of <b>undocumented</b> <b>immigrants</b> as the constitutionally protected parental rights may apply to non-citizens as well as United States citizens.|$|E

40|$|In the Court {{reasoned}} 			that {{by providing}} undocumented students with core academic instruction, public 			schools {{could contribute to}} their participation in democratic institutions and 			thus enhance civic life. This article 			assesses this {{and a set of}} related claims. 			Drawing on three data sets, the authors consider how access to public 			schools shapes the civic development and civic engagement of undocumented 			students and their parents. They first 			introduce data from a longitudinal study tracking the civic development of 			youth through high school and into adulthood. 			They then share survey data that indicates the relatively high levels of 			school participation among <b>undocumented</b> <b>immigrant</b> parents in. 			Finally, they report on a case study of 			twelve community-based groups who support robust school participation of <b>undocumented</b> 			<b>immigrant</b> parents. They find that public 			schools are key sites where <b>undocumented</b> <b>immigrant</b> youth and adults encounter 			other citizens and engage the state. Public 			schools teach about, and provide practice in, civic engagement. <b>Undocumented</b> <b>immigrant</b> students and parents 			develop knowledge, skills, and commitments for civic engagement by 			participating in school activities, school-based social networks, school 			governance, and educational reform...|$|R

25|$|Davis' second term, {{which lasted}} only ten months, was {{dominated}} by the recall election. Davis signed into law several controversial measures during the closing weeks of the recall campaign, including one granting drivers' licenses to <b>undocumented</b> <b>immigrants.</b> Davis also signed legislation requiring employers to pay for medical insurance for workers and legislation granting domestic partners {{many of the same}} rights as married people. He vetoed legislation that would have given <b>undocumented</b> <b>immigrants</b> free tuition for community college. Many of Davis' opponents were furious over the signings of these measures so late in his administration. Some political observers saw these efforts as an attempt to reinforce support from Hispanics, labor union members and liberal Democrats. Ultimately, Davis did not have as much support from Hispanics and union members in the recall election as he did in his 2002 re-election.|$|E

25|$|Romney {{also said}} during the primary {{campaign}} that he would seek to make the U.S. a much less hospitable place for <b>undocumented</b> <b>immigrants</b> by eliminating {{what he called the}} magnets that attract them. An example of a magnet, he said, would be offering to <b>undocumented</b> <b>immigrants</b> the same tuition discounts that are offered to legal residents who attend public colleges in their states, a benefit that rival candidate Governor Rick Perry supported for Texas students who had been brought as children to the U.S. by their undocumented immigrant parents. Romney similarly said that he opposed all forms of amnesty because he regards amnesty as another magnet for illegal immigration. He vowed that as president he would veto the DREAM Act (legislation which would allow individuals who had been brought to the U.S. as children when their families immigrated illegally an opportunity to qualify for permanent residency if they met certain qualifications), because he considered it yet another magnet for illegal immigration.|$|E

40|$|This master thesis project {{explores the}} ways in which the deserving/undeserving {{immigrant}} binary politically targets subject for incorporation into a national neoliberal project, while excluding others. Simultaneously, I also investigate {{the ways in}} which these targeted subjects have organized in response to structural inequities and in the process, have been making their own sense of political subjectivity. In this research I ask, what are the myths of good immigrant that have been created around <b>undocumented</b> <b>immigrant</b> students that produces a kind of exceptionalism that justifies incorporation? In what ways are undocumented student organizers consenting and contesting these narratives?	I examine the process of subjectification, “being made” through social norms and laws and “self-making” through everyday modes of resistance, of <b>undocumented</b> <b>immigrant</b> student organizers. I argue that <b>undocumented</b> <b>immigrant</b> student organizers have deployed a differential consciousness that has allowed them to identify ideological differences and oppositional expressions of power as opportunities for coalitions of resistance to challenge inequities within higher education and the dehumanization of immigrant morality binaries...|$|R
