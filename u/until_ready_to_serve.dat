On the other hands, microbial safety of those foods {{is a major concern}} in food industry. Treatments used to ensure microbial safety of foods can affect the medicinal, nutritional and sensory properties of food. Aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the affect of two such treatments namely UV irradiation and thermal processing on some important properties of <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> tropical almond drink. Prepared tropical almond <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> drink samples were subjected to UV irradiation and three different heat treatments. Then microbial stability, antioxidant activity and sensory properties of those treated samples were evaluated comparatively to non-treated samples. Two properties tested in this study, namely microbial stability and antioxidant activity was found to be affected by both treatments tested. Sensory properties of the product were found to be affected only by thermal processing. Compared to non-treated and thermal processed tropical almond <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> drinks, UV irradiated tropical almond <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> drinks were found to be microbiologically more safe and with preserved sensory properties. Hence, UV irradiation was identified as a suitable method to treat tropical almond <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> drinks <b>to</b> ensure microbial safety over thermal processing...|$|R
