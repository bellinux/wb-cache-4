5|$|According to Herodotus, {{there were}} a total of 69,500 lightly armed troops – 35,000 helots and 34,500 troops {{from the rest of}} Greece; roughly one per hoplite. The number of 34,500 has been {{suggested}} to represent one light skirmisher supporting each non-Spartan hoplite (33,700), together with 800 Athenian archers, whose presence in the battle Herodotus later notes. Herodotus tells <b>us</b> <b>that</b> {{there were a}}lso 1,800 Thespians (but does not say how they were equipped), giving a total strength of 108,200 men.|$|E

5|$|According to our {{surviving}} narratives, {{the three}} kings of Rome during the Etruscan occupation were Tarquinius Priscus, Servius Tullius, and Tarquinius Superbus. During this period the army underwent a reformation into a centurial army based on socio-economic class. This reformation is traditionally attributed to Servius Tullius, {{the second of}} the Etruscan kings. Tullius had earlier carried out the first Roman census of all citizens. Livy tells <b>us</b> <b>that</b> Tullius reformed the army by transplanting onto it the structure derived originally for civil life {{as a result of this}} census. At all levels, military service was, at this time, considered to be a civic responsibility and a way of advancing one's status within society.|$|E
5|$|As is {{discussed}} below, {{the reason for}} the delay was probably simply that neither the Athenians nor the Persians were willing to risk battle initially. This then raises the question of why the battle occurred when it did. Herodotus explicitly tells <b>us</b> <b>that</b> the Greeks attacked the Persians (and the other sources confirm this), {{but it is not clear}} why they did this before the arrival of the Spartans. There are two main theories to explain this.|$|E

5|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, as {{a result}} of both {{production}} peaks in some nations and political instability in others, the world's supply of petroleum tightened leading to an energy crisis during the 1970s and early 1980s. Petroleum prices rose dramatically, greatly benefiting Texas, particularly as compared {{to other parts of the}} <b>U.S.</b> <b>that</b> faced recession during this time. A new economic boom emerged which, though not as transformative as the early 1900s, pushed the population of Texas to the point that, by the end of the century, Texas was the second most populous state in the nation. Some sources, in fact, use the phrase Texas oil boom to refer to this later period rather than the earlier period that followed Spindletop.|$|E
5|$|Epaminondas evidently began {{serving as}} a soldier after adolescence; Plutarch refers to an {{incident}} involving Epaminondas that occurred during a battle at Mantinea. Though not explicitly stated, this was probably the Spartan attack on Mantinea in 385 BC, as described by Xenophon; Plutarch tells <b>us</b> <b>that</b> Epaminondas was there {{as part of a}} Theban force aiding the Spartans, so this battle fits the description.* Hanson, Hoplites, 146; Stylianoy, Diodorus Siculus, 172. However, Buck (Boiotia, 63) questions the existence of a SpartanTheban alliance in 385 BC. Epaminondas was certainly not old enough to have served at the First Battle of Mantinea which was in 418 BC.|$|E

5|$|Herodotus tells <b>us</b> <b>that,</b> {{on seeing}} {{the outcome of}} the battle hung in the balance, the {{disarmed}} Samians had joined in {{on the side of the}} allies, doing what they could. This inspired the other Ionian contingents to turn on the Persians as well. At which stage in the battle this happened is not clear; the Samians were presumably not in the main battle line (being disarmed), so it may have been after the Persians retreated to the camp. Meanwhile, the Milesians who were guarding the passes of Mycale also turned on the Persians. At first they misdirected the fleeing Persian contingents so that they ended up back amongst the Allied troops; then, perhaps seeing {{the outcome of the}} battle was certain, they began killing the fleeing Persians.|$|E
5|$|I thus learnt {{my first}} great {{lesson in the}} inquiry into these obscure fields of knowledge, never to accept the disbelief of great men or their accusations of imposture or of imbecility, as of any weight when opposed to the {{repeated}} observation of facts by other men, admittedly sane and honest.
