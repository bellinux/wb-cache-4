50|$|In {{the process}} of {{manufacture}} the raw cotton is procured by the weavers from the Karnataka State Handicrafts Development Corporation. Cotton 3/10s, an <b>unbleached</b> <b>yarn,</b> {{is used for the}} warp and cotton 10s of 6-ply is used for weft. The yarns could also be purchased from the market in Hubli. After procurement of the required material, pre-weaving process is started. This is a four-stage process. The first step being preparation of warp, which is a set of threads which runs through the length of the durries and which is covered by the weft. The decision on the length of the durrie is dictated by the 3/10s cotton converted into balls. While warp of the small durries are made in the open yard of the house, in the case of larger size durries of say 8 x 12 ft size, the warps are made in large open grounds in the town. Then a detailed work procedure is followed with sticks to warp the required number of threads. This warp is then shifted to the loom inside the house and weaving is done in a set pattern using warp beams of the looms, sticks and threads. The yarn of the weft 10s cotton is then dyed with dyes of black, yellow, red, brown, blue and green colours, mixed with water, and the hanks are kept in the dye solution for 20 minutes before removal and drying. The warp is fixed on the loom (which is of vertical design, quite ancient, unlike the horizontal loom used at the ground level at other places in the country) and adequately stretched to obtain the required tension. The weaving is then started by two weavers facing each other. Patterns are introduced in the warp at the appropriate stage of weaving. Vertical and diagonal lines are marked and weaved suitably. Weft is then covered over the warp, and this covering decides the quality of the durries. Weft is layered over the warp and pressed properly by beating and tamping. The cloth beam is used to wind the cloth as the durrie gets made. The designs are decided by the weavers intuitively. The progress achieved on each loom is about 6 in per day.|$|E
30|$|A denim {{fabric is}} defined as a 100 % woven cotton or union cloth with the ratios of 2 : 1 or 3 : 1 twill tissue using a warp, 7 – 20  Ne of cotton yarn (indigo vat dyeing), and the weft, <b>unbleached</b> <b>yarn</b> of 10 – 15  Ne. A surface of the denim fabric shows a blue color while the inside color shows a white color family only. Recently, the blue series {{production}} has been complimented by other colors with weaving patterns becoming more varied. Presently, the denim fabric is not limited to denim jean pants but also is widely used among those of all ages and genders of adult wear and children’s wear (Kim et al. 2009). In addition, the denim fabric is used in various other applications.|$|E
30|$|For {{the elastic}} {{recovery}} rate of Hanji denim fabrics {{developed in the}} study, we compared the result with that of existing stretch denim fabrics (S 1, S 2). Basically, the standard denim fabrics are made of <b>unbleached</b> cotton <b>yarn,</b> {{so there is no}} elasticity and many wrinkles. Recently, denim fabrics have been given elasticity according to consumers’ needs. The existing denim fabrics, which were compared with the Hanji denim fabric produced in this study, were denim fabrics with medium stretch (S 1) and high stretch (S 2). The approximate structure of the existing denim fabrics (S 1, S 2), using the analysis of fabric structure, showed cotton yarns (navy color) and stretch yarns used as warp and weft, respectively. Most Hanji denim fabrics produced, except for the DF 1 (C 10) and the DF 2 (C 10), showed a higher elastic recovery rate than that of existing medium stretch denim fabric (S 1). The high recovery rate trend resulted mainly in the denim fabrics using the rope-dyed yarn.|$|R
