5|$|The {{region was}} known for its wine. Since the 15th century the local {{inhabitants}} practiced viticulture and the wine producers formed St. Paul Vintners' Guild in 1447, the oldest such guild in the German-speaking world. Terraced vineyards extended <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the Krems River until it became a mountain stream and terrain was unsuitable for cultivation. The Loiben plain supported both viticulture and agriculture. As the terrain became steeper, the vines grew in terraces built from the dark Urgestein, primordial rock. From Dürenstein to Krems the river makes its wide curve; {{the mountains and the}} steeply terraced slopes prevent clear line-of-sight between the two towns.|$|E
25|$|In prehistoric times, great {{amounts of}} {{sediment}} {{collected on the}} floor of Lake Amora. The sediment was heavier than the salt deposits and squeezed the salt deposits upwards into what are now the Lisan Peninsula and Mount Sodom (on the southwest side of the lake). Geologists explain the effect in terms of a bucket of mud into which a large flat stone is placed, forcing the mud to creep <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the bucket. When the floor of the Dead Sea dropped further due to tectonic forces, the salt mounts of Lisan and Mount Sodom stayed in place as high cliffs (see salt dome).|$|E
25|$|Unlike other action puzzle games such as Tetris or Puzzle League {{where the}} player {{directly}} manipulates the game pieces, either as they fall or via a cursor, the player directly controls the character Toad, who moves around inside {{the playing field}} atop the fallen objects. Toad can pick up individual objects or lift entire stacks and place them elsewhere in the playing field, but is unable to manipulate objects he cannot immediately reach. However, Toad can perform a variety of additional tricks, such as kicking objects across the play field and scurrying <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> stacks to retrieve specific objects. If the player cannot clear the playing field of its objects quickly enough, the play field will eventually fill to the brim and trap Toad, resulting in a Game Over.|$|E

500|$|At 1 {{o'clock on}} Saturday 14 April, the steamers began leaving Circular Quay, {{conveying}} 8,000 {{of an estimated}} 10,000-strong crowd to Middle Harbour – a large crowd considering the alternative attractions that day of Sydney Royal Easter Show (known then simply as [...] "the Exhibition") and horse racing.

500|$|Helvella queletii has {{a roughly}} similar form and appearance, but the ribbing in that species {{does not extend}} up the margin as does H.acetabulum. H.griseoalba has ribs that extend halfway <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the fruit body, but {{the color of the}} cup is pale to dark gray rather than cream. The fruit bodies also {{resemble}} those of H.costifera, but the latter species is distinguished [...] by its grayish to grayish-brown hymenium; like H.acetabulum, it has ribs that extend to most of the outside of the fruit body. There are sometimes intermediate forms between the two species, making them difficult to distinguish. H.robusta is also similar to H.acetabulum, but has a lighter-colored hymenium, a robust stem, and the margin of the fruit body is often bent over the stem at maturity. In contrast, H.acetabulum never has the edge of the fruit body bent over the stem, and the stem is [...] "indistinct or prominent, but never robust".|$|E

500|$|A {{standard}} gauge railway tunnel, codenamed Ida, {{was to be}} built on a curving path that would connect it with both the east- and west-bound main line railway, allowing trains to run straight through the complex without needing to reverse or be turned around. This would serve as the main unloading station, where missiles and supplies would be offloaded onto trolleys that would transport them into the connecting galleries Mathilde and Hugo. Hugo connected in turn with Sophie, a dead-end railway tunnel branching from the main line into Ida. Each of the main tunnels {{had a number of}} unnamed side tunnels of the same dimensions as the main tunnels and up to [...] long. The central feature of the complex was a huge octagonal rocket-preparation chamber directly under the dome. It was never completed but would have been [...] in diameter and up to [...] high.

On the Pacific Surfliner cars, large [...] "Surfliner" [...] letters, the same style letters as on Phase IV Superliners, go across {{the lower part of}} the large blue stripe, below the upper-level windows, along with the car type and number on each end of the car in white lettering.|$|E

Another 2 days later, the Roar would release their new Umbro home kit, ditching the black pants and going with an all orange kit.

2500|$|The ampullae are round {{when seen}} from the front, with a {{flattened}} body giving convex faces and a small neck, often with a fitting round the neck for a chain or cord by which they could be suspended, or perhaps worn. There are records of similar blessed objects, or eulogia, being hung on the bedpost for protection from demons at night, and the oil, or just the relic, {{was believed to be}} able to heal the sick when applied to them. [...] Often there is a strip in a different metal running round the edge of the faces and <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the neck, with little rings for a suspension cord. [...] In the Monza examples these strips are secured by wire wound rather untidily round the neck. [...] A diameter for the main body of about 5–7cm is typical, and in a side view the body swells to a maximum thickness of about 3cm. [...] Those at Monza are in generally good condition, but those from Bobbio and other examples such as the one at Dumbarton Oaks are flattened and damaged; they are now mostly black in colour.|$|E

5|$|Orographic or relief {{snowfall}} {{is caused}} when masses of air pushed by wind are forced <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> elevated land formations, such as large mountains. The lifting <b>of</b> air <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a mountain or range results in adiabatic cooling, and ultimately condensation and precipitation. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier, warmer air on <b>the</b> descending, leeward <b>side.</b> <b>The</b> resulting enhanced productivity of snow {{fall and the}} decrease in temperature with elevation means that snow depth and seasonal persistence of snowpack increases with elevation in snow-prone areas.|$|R
