40|$|Thermoeconomic faults {{diagnosis}} of {{air conditioning units}} is a pioneeristic approach to detect single or multiple faults and quantify their impact in terms of additional energy consumption. The poor reliability of conventional thermoeconomic approaches has been limiting the interest for practical applications of this technique. In this paper an improved thermoeconomic diagnosis is proposed and applied to a reference 120 kWc air-cooled air conditioning system; a simulator is used to evaluate thermodynamic data under normal and faulty conditions. Four faults are individually or simultaneously imposed: fouling at condenser and evaporator, refrigerant <b>undercharge</b> and compressor valve leakage. For setting up the diagnostic tool only a few numerical or experimental tests are required; the results testify the procedure to be sufficiently reliable both when heavy or light faults are considered.

40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of soft faults in vapor compression cooling systems {{is a crucial}} activity, since malfunctions may provoke heavy degradation in plant performance and increase the power consumption for space cooling. Among the various Faults Detection and Diagnosis techniques developed {{over the last two}} decades, thermoeconomic diagnosis has been playing only a marginal role due to the difficulties encountered when applying the conventional thermoeconomic approaches to vapor compression refrigeration plants. In this paper a critical analysis on capabilities and limits of thermoeconomic {{diagnosis of}} refrigeration systems is proposed. The reference plant assumed for this study is a 116 kWc air-condensed rooftop systems charged with R 407 C as refrigerant. A reliable 1 -D steady-state simulator is used to calculate thermodynamic and performance data in “off-design” operating conditions; since the simulator has no specific capabilities to simulate faulty systems, literature-derived results were used to adjust the input settings for each specific fault simulated. Among the most common faults in rooftop air conditioners, four different malfunctions are examined: fouling at condenser, fouling at evaporator, refrigerant <b>undercharge</b> (either due to leakage or erroneous charging during service) and extra-superheating along the suction line; the faults are imposed both individually and simultaneously. The thermoeconomic diagnosis is performed basing on the “fuel impact” approach; the need to split physical exergy into its thermal and mechanical fractions and the presence of dissipative components suggested us to formulate some methodological premises, discussed in detail in the paper. The results testify that the adopted conventional approach is not very reliable; although some faults are properly identified, in fact, false fault signals and erroneous causalization eventually resulted, due to the presence of system-level faults (i. e. faults not strictly associated with any specific plant component, like refrigerant <b>undercharge),</b> the subjective assumptions made as concerns the cost allocation of residues and some controversial aspects concerning the productive structure...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an alternative to}} the capital adequacy requirements proposed by the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision.

The alternative approach offers a number of advantages, including a framework for assessing the costs and benefits that increasing capital standards entails. The paper discusses problems of implementation and applies the approach to data taken from the great majority of banks that operated in Switzerland in the period 1987 - 93.

This is in spite of well-documented widespread prevalence of efficiency degrading faults affecting these systems. This is probably because existing fault detection methods require time and extensive models that are not easily available to energy auditors on a one-day audit. Therefore the proposed automated fault detection and diagnostic device for unitary air conditioners uses quick temperature and pressure measurements, along with easily obtainable nameplate or brochure data, to detect refrigerant <b>undercharge,</b> refrigerant overcharge, liquid line restriction, condenser fouling and evaporator fouling faults. It also predicts the related energy and cost saving for each fault.

40|$|Fault {{detection}} and diagnostics (FDD) tools are being increasingly applied in air-conditioning systems. There {{are many different}} protocols used in these FDD tools, so an important question to ask is: how well do the protocols work? This paper describes the ongoing development of the first standardized method of evaluation for FDD protocols applied to air-cooled vapor compression air-conditioning systems. The general approach is to feed a library of data – including temperatures, pressures, and humidity – to a candidate FDD protocol, and observe {{the responses of the}} protocol. The library includes data from units operating with no fault or with single faults. The faults include <b>undercharge</b> or overcharge of refrigerant; impaired heat transfer in the condenser or evaporator; liquid line flow restriction; presence of non-condensable gas in the refrigerant; and compressor valve leakage. The outputs from the test are categorized, and statistics and figures are generated. A preliminary evaluation of RCA, a public domain FDD protocol, has been conducted using laboratory measurement data from 13 air conditioning systems.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{improper}} charging on the performance (capacity, EER, power consumption, SEER, and coefficient of degradation) of a residential air conditioner during the steady state (wet and dry coils) and cycling operation was investigated. The fully charged condition was established as a base case. A full charge was obtained charging the unit to the superheat specified by the manufacturer's charging chart for specific set of indoor and outdoor temperatures. Once the full charge was determined, the unit was subjected to 20 %, 15 %, 10 %, and 5 % under and overcharging of refrigerant (by mass). The fully charged tests were compared to under and overcharging. The performance of the unit was evaluated {{as a function of}} charge as well as at four outdoor room temperatures (82 ?F, 90 ?F, 95 ?F, and 100 ?F). As the outdoor temperature increased, the total capacity and EER dropped. The investigation of improper charging showed that the total capacity, EER, and SEER were more sensitive to undercharging than overcharging conditions. A 20 % <b>undercharge</b> resulted in a 21 % reduction in SEER while a 20 % overcharge produced a 11 % reduction in SEER.

40|$|The American {{criminal}} justice system has experienced a significant expansion in the number and severity of penalties triggered by misdemeanor convictions. In particular, legislatures have increasingly attached severe collateral consequences to misdemeanor offenses  penalties such as requirements to register as a sex offender, prohibitions on owning or possessing a firearm, and deportation. Although there is a wealth of scholarship studying the effect this development has on defendants and their attorneys, {{little attention has been}} paid to the impact collateral consequences have on prosecutorial incentives. This Article starts to remedy that gap by exploring the influence that collateral consequences exert on initial charging decisions in low-level prosecutions. Critically, the ability to impose certain collateral consequences through a misdemeanor conviction unlocks an array of additional charging options for prosecutors. As a result, prosecutors are now more likely to engage in a practice I term strategic <b>undercharging.</b>  A prosecutor engages in strategic <b>undercharging</b> when she charges a lesser offense than she otherwise could, but does so for reasons that advance her own prosecutorial aims and not as an act of grace or leniency. In other words, prosecutors can sometimes gain more by charging less. By explaining why (and when) prosecutors are likely to engage in strategic <b>undercharging,</b> this Article complicates the conventional wisdom that prosecutors reflexively file the most severe charges available. This Article also proposes that collateral consequences be factored into the determination of what procedural safeguards are afforded a criminal defendant. Under existing law, collateral consequences are generally deemed irrelevant to that inquiry; the degree of procedural protection provided in a given case turns exclusively on the threatened termof incarceration. Changing this approach could have several salutary effects on the administration of collateral consequences. At aminimum, it would honor a basic principle underlying our {{criminal justice}} system: the threat of serious penalties warrants serious procedures...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} {{across a}} range of state of charge (SOC) is an important performance parameter in variable Battery Energy Storage System (BESS). A novel method was proposed to evaluate the effect of heat generation with the parameters of resistance and entropy change on the energy efficiency. The energy efficiency was evaluated through measuring the resistance and entropy change during different DOD (depth of discharge). The internal resistance was determined by constant current discharge, followed by plots of V vs I at constant SOC, and found it exhibit a reduction as SOC increasing. In addition, the entropy change was measured by the temperature change of the open-circuit voltage. Energy efficiency results were obtained at constant charge input levels and different discharge rates under the different DOD. The result show that the energy efficiency has a decreasing trend with the increase of the depth of discharge, and the energy efficiency plateaus at 60 % DOD. The energy efficiency is decreased from 88. 8 % to 87. 3 % under 1 C discharge from 20 % to 80 % DOD. Furthermore, the lower the current rate, the higher the energy efficiency under the constant DOD. We isolate the effects of <b>undercharge</b> and underdischarge, and find the difference of energy efficiency under different current rate increases gradually with the increase of DOD.

The Court’s ruling on March 26, 2014, did not seem to weaken the Lautenberg Amendment. The reality, however, is that the Lautenberg Amendment was egregiously ineffective even before the Court’s ruling, and the “victory” in the recent case masks an enduring problem in the enforcement of the gun ban.

40|$|All Your Time, All The Time: A Critical Ethnography in a Knowledge-intensive Firm This {{thesis is}} a study of {{management}} control change within one department of a knowledge-intensive firm (KnowCo). Using a critical ethnography, I examine a management initiative to change the time recording practices of staff. Within knowledge-intensive firms, time charging is the main financial control through which projects are costed and clients charged commensurable fees. Whilst time/cost data {{is vital to the}} success of these firms, employees routinely <b>undercharge</b> their time, making it difficult to cost projects and set fees. When fees are fixed, undercharging artificially inflates the profitability of projects making it a widely accepted practice amongst staff. To address the undercharging of time, and the inflation of profitability, KnowCo embarked on a mission (‘All Your Time, All The Time’ (AYTATT)) to change how staff charged their time so that they charged all of the time they worked. This initiative attempted to change time recording practices to improve the reliability of cost information, and therefore, financial control. AYTATT held the potential to impact negatively project profitability and thus the perceived performance of staff. This study explores the implementation of AYTATT and its impact on employees. Through telling the story of AYTATT, this thesis offers new insights into the undercharging of time and management control change. For AYTATT to be effective, it had to challenge the ways management controls associated with time charging functioned. My research suggests that the relationships between management controls and the undercharging of time within the firm were poorly understood and so were largely ignored by management as they implemented AYTATT. Instead, the project focused on shaping employees’ perceptions of the undercharging of time through rhetoric. Whilst the use of rhetorical strategies resulted in management control change within KnowCo, there was significant deviation from the aims of AYTATT and the outcomes observed in this study...|$|E

The SCBR regulates the solar array power during insolation to prevent battery overcharge or <b>undercharge</b> conditions.

This technology uses industry-standard dc-dc converters and a unique interconnection to provide size, weight, efficiency, fault tolerance, and modularity benefits over existing systems. The high-voltage SCBR shown in the photograph has demonstrated power densities of over 1000 watts per kilogram (W/kg). Using four 150 -W dc-dc converter modules, it can process 2500 W of power at 120 Vdc with a minimum input voltage of 90 Vdc. Efficiency of the SCBR was 94 to 98 percent over the entire operational range. Internally, the unit is made of two separate SCBR s, each with its own analog control circuitry, to demonstrate the modularity of the technology. The analog controllers regulate the output current and incorporate the output voltage limit with active current sharing between the two units. They also include voltage and current telemetry, on/off control, and baseplate temperature sensors. For peak power tracking, the SCBR was connected to a LabView-based data acquisition system for telemetry and control.

Over the life of HST vehicle configuration, charge system degradation and failures together with thermal design limitations have {{had a significant effect}} on the capacity of the HST batteries. Changes made to the charge system configuration in order to protect against power system failures and to maintain battery thermal stability resulted in <b>undercharging</b> of the batteries. This <b>undercharging</b> resulted in decreased usable battery capacity as well as battery cell voltage/capacity divergence. This cell divergence was made evident during on-orbit battery capacity measurements by a relatively shallow slope of the discharge curve following the discharge knee. Early efforts to improve the battery performance have been successful. On-orbit capacity measurement data indicates increases in the usable battery capacity of all six batteries as well as improvements in the battery cell voltage/capacity divergence. Additional measures have been implemented to improve battery performance, however, failures within the HST Power Control Unit (PCU) have prevented verification of battery status.
