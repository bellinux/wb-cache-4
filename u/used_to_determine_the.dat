5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to detect Gliese 876 c is that only a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained.

However, in a resonant system such as Gliese 876, gravitational interactions between the planets can be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> true masses.

Many external mechanical defenses and large quantitative defenses are constitutive, as they require large amounts of resources to produce and are difficult to mobilize.
