5|$|The first {{victims were}} a few {{thousand}} men arrested in July 1941 and brought from Riga Central Prison. In 1942 another 12,000 Jews were brought from Germany, Austria, and Czechoslovakia. In 1943 Riga Ghetto prisoners were brought here who were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> at Kaiserwald concentration camp, followed by those from the camp itself <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in 1944. In 1943 and onwards Nazis dug up graves and burned the bodies to hide the evidence. It is estimated {{that there are now}} around 20,000 victims buried in the forest.|$|E
5|$|Final {{outcomes}} {{for people with}} SCSFLS remain poorly studied. Symptoms may resolve {{in as little as}} two weeks, or persist for months. Less commonly, patients may suffer from unremitting symptoms for many years. People with chronic SCSFLS may be disabled and <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> Recurrent CSF leak at an alternate site after recent repair is common.|$|E
5|$|In June 1835, Friedrich {{suffered}} {{his first}} stroke, which {{left him with}} minor limb paralysis and greatly reduced his ability to paint. As a result, he was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in oil; instead he was limited to watercolour, sepia and reworking older compositions.|$|E

5|$|A Nosek family {{representative}} {{said that}} based on the witness testimonies, the family {{did not believe that}} Blythe was solely responsible. He continued {{that he would not be}} substantiating the requested amount, as no money could replace the loss the family has suffered. He further added that Daniel had died on his father's birthday, and his mother has consequently become a psychiatry patient <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
5|$|Every few weeks, the Nazis {{staged a}} roundup in the Lvov ghetto of people <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> These roundups {{typically}} took place while the able-bodied were absent doing forced labour. In one such deportation, Wiesenthal's mother and other elderly Jewish women were transported by freight train to Belzec extermination camp {{and killed in}} August 1942. Around the same time, a Ukrainian policeman shot Cyla's mother to death {{on the front porch}} of her home in Buczacz while she was being evicted. Cyla and Simon Wiesenthal lost 89 relatives during the Holocaust.|$|E
5|$|In October 1932, Sargent {{suffered}} a near-fatal attack of tuberculosis. For {{almost two years}} he was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> {{and it was only}} later in the 1930s that he returned to the concert scene. In 1936, he conducted his first opera at Covent Garden, Gustave Charpentier's Louise.

40|$|Workers' {{compensation}} laws influence {{recovery from}} injury. They affect the “cause” of disease, access to care, diagnostic evaluation, treatment, response to treatment and residual disability. Paradoxically, financial compensation may discourage return <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> {{the appeal process}} may increase disability, an open claim may inhibit return <b>to</b> <b>work</b> and recovering patients may be <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> return <b>to</b> <b>work...</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{soup kitchen}} {{was built in}} 1880, {{replacing}} the police station which adjoined the hospital on the west side, by public subscription and dispensed soup to the ‘deserving poor’ until 1891. The soup was not free: it cost half a pence per pint. People who had donated each {{had a number of}} tickets which they could give to those people who they believed qualified for the ration. The deserving poor in Victorian times were those <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> during the winter months. Those individuals classed as undeserving were those whose poverty was deemed to be caused by indolence and alcoholism.|$|E
5|$|Another {{solution}} to {{the vulnerability of the}} RAF bombers was to fly at night, which was taken up as the primary tactic of Bomber Command. The Mk. X proved {{to be very difficult to}} read at night and bombers that carried it were quickly refitted with the earlier Mk. VII or Mk. IX sight. The Norden was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> at night at all; the bomb aimer had to locate the target long in advance of the drop point using a built-in telescope and targets were simply not visible at the required distances in low light.|$|E

5|$|Despite being {{marketed as}} holiday homes, {{many of the}} {{original}} houses became permanent residences due to post-war housing shortages in London and by 1950 {{there was a significant}} year-round population. Jaywick now includes large numbers of retired and unemployed people. A 2011 report in The Guardian found that 62% of working age residents in Jaywick received benefits, compared to 15% national average. A subsequent report in 2015 reiterated the area {{was one of the most}} deprived English neighbourhoods. According to the Citizens Advice Bureau, 40% of residents are <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> due to a disability or long term illness. 60% of pupils at Frobisher Primary School, on the edge of the village, receive free school meals.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{military}} service, Jose Sarria returned to San Francisco. He enrolled in college with plans {{of becoming a}} teacher. He and his sister Teresa began frequenting the Black Cat Bar, a center of the city's Beat and bohemian scene. Sarria and Teresa both became smitten with a waiter named Jimmy Moore and bet as to which of them could get him into bed first. José won the bet and soon Moore and he were lovers. Sarria began covering for Moore when he was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> and soon Black Cat owner Sol Stoumen hired him as a cocktail waiter.|$|E
5|$|Formby's {{health was}} further damaged in the {{influenza}} pandemic of 1918, {{during which he}} contracted the disease while appearing at the Manchester Hippodrome and was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> for a month. He was taken ill during the runs of pantomimes in both 1918 and 1919, was forced to rest for three months in 1919, and collapsed on stage during a performance in Newcastle upon Tyne in the 1920–21 pantomime season. Formby was advised by doctors to emigrate to South Africa {{for the benefit of}} his health, but he preferred to stay in Britain, with his wife and children, and continued to work. During his performances his wife would wait in the wings with ice for him to suck to stop internal bleeding, and an oxygen tent was present in the stage wings ready for emergencies.|$|E
50|$|Menstrual leave {{is a type}} of leave where a {{woman may}} have the option to take paid or unpaid leave from her {{employment}} if she is menstruating and is <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> go <b>to</b> <b>work</b> because of this. Menstrual leave is controversial because it is seen by some as a criticism of women's work efficiency or as sexism.|$|R
50|$|When - {{according}} to himself - Andersson was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> continue <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with his businesspartners, he stopped with the Majestic-project.

To help matters, Griet is sent {{to work as a}} maid in the household of famed painter Johannes Vermeer (Colin Firth). Griet works hard, almost wordlessly, in the lowest position in a harsh hierarchy, doing her best despite spiteful treatment by one of Vermeer's children. While she is on a routine shopping trip outside the house, a butcher's son, Pieter (Cillian Murphy), notices Griet and falls in love with her, even though she is slow to return his affections.|$|E
5|$|In 1945 Parsons {{separated}} from Helen after {{having an affair}} with her sister Sara; when Sara left him for L. Ron Hubbard, he conducted the Babalon Working, a series of rituals designed to invoke the Thelemic goddess Babalon to Earth. He and Hubbard continued the procedure with Marjorie Cameron, whom Parsons married in 1946. After Hubbard and Sara defrauded him of his life savings, Parsons resigned from the O.T.O. and went through various jobs while acting as a consultant for the Israeli rocket program. Amid the climate of McCarthyism, he was accused of espionage and left <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in rocketry. In 1952, Parsons {{died at the age of}} 37 in a home laboratory explosion that attracted national media attention; the police ruled it an accident, but many associates suspected suicide or assassination.|$|E
5|$|Jennings {{had been}} a heavy drinker of alcohol {{for much of his}} life. His {{addiction}} worsened {{after the death of his}} first wife, Ann, and his development of rheumatism. Jennings's alcoholism led to defeat in his reelection campaign in 1830. In retirement his condition worsened and he was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> his farm. When his finances collapsed, his creditors sought to take his land holdings and Charlestown farm. To protect his friend, U.S. Senator John Tipton purchased Jennings's farm and permitted him to continue living there. After Jennings's death, his estate was sold, but it left no funds to purchase a headstone for his grave, which remained unmarked for fifty-seven years.|$|E

5|$|When the Second World War began, Bethe {{wanted to}} {{contribute}} to the war effort, but was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on classified projects until he became a citizen. Following the advice of the Caltech aerodynamicist Theodore von Kármán, Bethe collaborated with his friend Teller on a theory of shock waves which are generated by the passage of a projectile through a gas. Bethe considered it one of their most influential papers. He also worked on a theory of armor penetration, which was immediately classified by the Army, making it inaccessible to Bethe, who was not an American citizen at the time.|$|E
5|$|Anthony Dominick Benedetto {{was born}} on August 3, 1926, in Astoria, Queens, New York, to grocer John Benedetto and {{seamstress}} Anna Suraci. In 1906, John had emigrated from Podàrgoni, a rural eastern district of the southern Italian city of Reggio Calabria. Anna {{had been born in}} the U.S. shortly after her parents also emigrated from the Calabria region in 1899. Other relatives came over as well as part of the mass migration of Italians to America. Tony grew up with an older sister, Mary, and an older brother, John Jr. With a father who was ailing and <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> the children grew up in poverty. John Sr. instilled in his son a love of art and literature and a compassion for human suffering, but died when Tony was 10 years old. The experience of growing up in the Great Depression and a distaste for the effects of the Hoover Administration would make the child a lifelong Democrat.|$|E
