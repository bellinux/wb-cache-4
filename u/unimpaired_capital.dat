60|$|And {{nothing ever}} came of it. The thing {{remained}} a secret {{with the three}} men. Nor did Daylight ever give the secret away, though that afternoon, {{leaning back in his}} stateroom on the Twentieth Century, his shoes off, and feet on a chair, he chuckled long and heartily. New York remained forever puzzled over the affair; nor could it hit upon a rational explanation. By all rights, Burning Daylight should have gone broke, yet it was known that he immediately reappeared in San Francisco possessing an apparently <b>unimpaired</b> <b>capital.</b> This was evidenced by the magnitude of the enterprises he engaged in, such as, for instance, Panama Mail, by sheer weight of money and fighting power wresting the control away from Shiftily and selling out in two months to the Harriman interests at a rumored enormous advance.|$|E
50|$|CLF is {{organized}} into five regional branches to serve different states. To become a member, credit unions purchase {{stock in the}} Central Liquidity Facility, at an amount equal to 1/2 of 1% of an average of six months of their <b>unimpaired</b> <b>capital</b> and surplus or $50 (whichever is greater).|$|E
5000|$|Credit union service {{organizations}} (CUSOs) are corporate entities owned by federally chartered or federally insured, state chartered credit unions. Under United States federal {{law and the}} National Credit Union Administration regulations Part 712, federal credit unions may make an investment in or a loan to a CUSO. Aggregate investments in CUSOs by federal credit unions may not exceed 1% of paid in and <b>unimpaired</b> <b>capital,</b> and aggregate loans to CUSOs may not exceed 1% of paid in and <b>unimpaired</b> <b>capital.</b> (State chartered credit unions will follow state law {{and in some instances}} these limitations may be different.) Every CUSO must be subject to a legal opinion to ensure the proposed structure is permissible and does not engage in unauthorized activities, and to ensure that potential liabilities are limited to the funds invested or loaned to it. Furthermore, every CUSO must explicitly allow the National Credit Union Administration the right to review its books and records, which must be maintained according to GAAP. One of the top affiliations of CUSOs is the National Association of Credit Union Service Organizations. NACUSO (www.nacuso.org) is a membership based advocacy organization that provide members a shared collaborative platform to work together on innovation and improving the success of CUSOs and their credit unions.|$|E
40|$|The regulation-by-enforcement {{critique}} {{has made}} an impact at the Securities and Exchange Commission, and scholars are beginning to turn this critique against other agencies. Using this critique, this Note demonstrates that the federal combination rules for the lending-limit law should be rewritten. Under the lending-limit law, national banking associations may lend only {{a certain percentage of}} their <b>unimpaired</b> <b>capital</b> and unimpaired surplus to any one borrower. Although the combination rules include several per se rules pursuant to which loans made to two borrowers will be aggregated, they also grant the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) the power to determine ad hoc whether to aggregate two loans. This power to determine on an ad hoc and even on a post hoc basis whether a violation of the law has occurred is an affront {{to the rule of law}} and is unfair to the industry. The combination rules should be amended to remove the OCC 2 ̆ 7 s power to make ad hoc determinations...|$|E
