50|$|The Amazon's {{bodywork}} {{was constructed}} of phosphate-treated steel (to improve paint adhesion) and with heavy use of <b>undercoating</b> <b>and</b> anti-corrosive oil treatment.|$|R
50|$|The coat {{is short}} and lies close to the body. It has no <b>undercoat</b> <b>and</b> is firm to touch. It may not be silky, but is noticeably very glossy.|$|R
40|$|New tool injects liquids or gases into narrow crevices. Can be used {{to apply}} {{caulking}} and waterproofing compounds, adhesives, detergent, <b>undercoats</b> <b>and</b> oil and to aerate hard-to-reach places. Nozzle can reach into opening 1 / 32 inch wide to depth of more than 4 inches. Although thin, device is rigid and strong...|$|R
5000|$|... "white-from-white-faced" [...] or [...] "dark-eared white" [...] - [...] a {{combination}} of the dominant white-faced gene and the husky gene that produces a white hamster that retains a greyish <b>undercoat</b> <b>and</b> ears ...|$|R
50|$|His {{pictorial}} compositions {{are simply}} {{the results of}} his imagination without any cinematographic aids, using principally the oil canvas technique called “alla prima”, keen to the original impressionist painters, which cancels the initial <b>undercoated</b> <b>and</b> glazed steps.|$|R
5000|$|Colours of the Syrian hamster can be {{described}} in three ways: as [...] "self", [...] "agouti" [...] or [...] "combinations". Self colours will be a consistent coat colour with the same colour topcoat <b>and</b> <b>undercoat.</b> Agouti hamsters have a different, lighter <b>undercoat</b> <b>and</b> will have markings around the eyes. Combinations are produced when two (or more) self or agouti colours are present.|$|R
50|$|Products that aggressively {{adhere to}} the damaged Hypalon or PVC shell can fix {{virtually}} any surface damage through a unique chemical bonding between the <b>undercoat</b> <b>and</b> topcoat that permanently vulcanizes the two rubber coatings together to make the inflatable as good as new.|$|R
5000|$|The coat is long, with a Cashmere-type <b>undercoat,</b> <b>and</b> usually ruddy, {{but there}} are various colour variant classifications, {{including}} red-and-white, black-and-white, grey, brown, brown-and-red and [...] The skin is described as [...] "fine and elastic", and usually matches the coat, though may range from pink to grey-black.|$|R
500|$|They have a soft, dense, thick <b>undercoat</b> <b>and</b> a rough outer coat, {{which can}} grow to about [...] long. The fur fills out {{the face to}} give a rounded appearance. As puppies develop into adults, their coarse outer coat is {{normally}} removed by either [...] "hand-stripping", especially for dog-showing, or otherwise clipping.|$|R
50|$|When you {{consider}} painting, {{there is usually}} a <b>primer,</b> an <b>undercoat</b> <b>and</b> a topcoat. Similarly in renders {{there may be a}} stipple coat, then an undercoat (sometimes called a base coat) and finally a final coat (sometimes called a topcoat). The difference is that in renders, the final thickness is 15 mm.|$|R
5000|$|They have a soft, dense, thick <b>undercoat</b> <b>and</b> a rough outer coat, {{which can}} grow to about 2 in long. The fur fills out {{the face to}} give a rounded appearance.

40|$|Different {{areas in}} the nuclear {{facility}} require protecive coatings which {{in addition to having}} the normal properties should withstand nuclear radiation as well as the rigorous decontamination schedule. At present in our country coating system comprising of inorganic zinc rich <b>primer,</b> epoxy <b>undercoat</b> <b>and</b> top coats all of which are imported are made use of for this purpose by Nuclear Power Board (BARC). Difficulties in procuring these materials, deterioration during transit and other drawbacks have {{led to the development of}} these coating systems indigenously. The indigenisation would help not only in import substitution but also in having a strict control over the quality of the product. The physical and protective properties of the indigenously developed system comprising of <b>primer</b> <b>undercoat</b> <b>and</b> finish coat and those of the imported system are evaluated by various tests and the results are presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|The {{continuous}} {{development in the}} field of protective coatings and the search for newer materials with improved properties have led to the emergence of interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) as binders for high performance organic coatings for corrosion protection. In this study, one such ambient curing IPN polymer alloy poly(epoxy–urethane–acrylate) developed specially for use in protective coatings has been studied. <b>Undercoat</b> <b>and</b> a topcoat based on the alloy have been formulated and coated over zinc ethyl silicate primed steel surfaces. Similar formulations based on an epoxy polyamide <b>undercoat</b> <b>and</b> a PU topcoat has been formulated and coated over zinc ethyl silicate primed steel surfaces. Both the systems were evaluated for their physical and corrosion resistant properties by subjecting them to accelerated laboratory tests and field test at a corrosive location. The results are reported and conclusions drawn in this pape...|$|R
2500|$|Greyhounds do {{not have}} <b>undercoats</b> <b>and</b> thus {{are less likely to}} trigger dog allergies in humans (they are {{sometimes}} incorrectly referred to as [...] "hypoallergenic"). The lack of an undercoat, coupled with a general lack of body fat, also makes Greyhounds more susceptible to extreme temperatures (both hot and cold); because of this, they must be housed inside.|$|R
5000|$|As {{with the}} Pygora breed, the fiber is {{classified}} into three types, A, B and C, {{depending on the}} length and type of the fibers. Type A is Angora-type mohair, long and lustrous; type B is [...] "cashgora", which combines mohair with cashmere-type <b>undercoat</b> <b>and</b> is of medium length; type C is like cashmere and is shorter.|$|R

50|$|The Skye is double coated, with a short, soft <b>undercoat</b> <b>and</b> a hard, {{straight}} topcoat. The shorter hair of {{the head}} veils the forehead and eyes, forming a moderate beard. The ears are generally well feathered and, in prick-eared examples, the hair normally falls like a fringe, accenting the form, and blending with the side locks.|$|R
50|$|The coat {{consists}} of a soft, extremely dense <b>undercoat</b> <b>and</b> straight, harsh outer guard hairs. The guard hairs are one to two inches long, with the longer hair mainly in a ruff around the neck and {{on the backs of}} the thighs. The coat requires a thorough weekly brushing. Shedding is moderate most of the year, heavy during the twice-yearly shedding season.|$|R
50|$|This {{medium-sized}} hound has broad flat ears {{set high}} on the head. They have a thick double coat including a coarse <b>undercoat,</b> <b>and</b> the rear legs are well feathered. There are two main colours, red, and black and tan, both of which may have white markings. It has a fast gait {{and can be used}} for either tracking or hunting.|$|R
50|$|A still extant {{example of}} 17th-century house oil {{painting}} is Ham House in Surrey, England, where a primer was used {{along with several}} <b>undercoats</b> <b>and</b> an elaborate decorative overcoat; the pigment and oil mixture would have been ground into a paste with a mortar and pestle. The process was done by hand by the painters and exposed them to lead poisoning due to the white-lead powder.|$|R
50|$|The North Ronaldsay is a double-coated breed, {{meaning they}} have a wool <b>undercoat</b> <b>and</b> overcoat. The <b>undercoat</b> tends to be finer and soft, {{suitable}} for garments that would touch the skin, whereas the overcoat is coarser, with long hair that protects the sheep from the cold, wet weather of their natural environment. This fibre is more durable and tends {{to be used in}} overgarments.|$|R
50|$|They were {{originally}} used on heavy freight services from Sydney to Broadmeadow {{and later on}} North Coast services to Brisbane and Main South line services to Albury. All were delivered in grey <b>undercoat</b> <b>and</b> painted in verdant green at Eveleigh Carriage Workshops. For the 1954 Royal Tour of Queen Elizabeth II 4001 and 4002 were repainted blue. In the 1960s all were repainted Indian red.|$|R
50|$|Grooming a dog {{before it}} is bathed is {{important}} as it frees up <b>and</b> removes dead <b>undercoat</b> <b>and</b> matting, and allows proper penetration of water and shampoo to the skin. This {{can be done by}} using a slicker brush all over its body, especially on its legs, and the places where knotting occurs frequently. Groomers sometimes use a metal comb when combing for the second time, paying more attention to the toes and between the toes. Metal combs can be helpful in the areas of the dog's body that are common spots for knots. Brushing and combing the tail is also important as it is a commonly missed area.|$|R
50|$|A Siberian Husky's coat {{is thicker}} {{than that of}} most other dog breeds, {{comprising}} two layers: a dense <b>undercoat</b> <b>and</b> a longer topcoat of short, straight guard hairs. It protects the dogs effectively against harsh Arctic winters, but the coat also reflects heat in the summer. It is able to withstand temperatures as low as -50 to -60 C. The undercoat is often absent during shedding. Their thick coats require weekly grooming.|$|R
50|$|The pelage {{of a show}} animal may {{be divided}} into {{different}} types of hair, fur or wool with a texture ranging from downy to spiky. In addition, the animal may be single-coated or may {{have a number of}} coats, such as an <b>undercoat</b> <b>and</b> a topcoat (made up of guard hairs (also called an outer coat or, sometimes, overcoat). The state of the coat is considered an indication of the animal's breeding and health.|$|R
40|$|In the pusuit of the {{suitable}} {{substitute for}} the conventional bright nickel-chromium system, bright nickel-iron-chromium system has been accepted {{all over the world}} as a viable alternative especially for indoor applications. Further research on the effect of different <b>undercoats</b> <b>and</b> topcoats with a view to improving their corrosion performance has led to the conclusion that an underlayer of semibright nickel, similar to that in duplex nickel, can substantially improve the corrosion resistance and make it suitable for outdoor use...|$|R
50|$|The Border Terrier has {{a double}} coat {{consisting}} of a short, dense, soft <b>undercoat</b> <b>and</b> harsh, wiry weather- and dirt-resistant, close-lying outer coat with no curl or wave. This coat usually requires hand-stripping twice a year to remove dead hair. It then takes about eight weeks for the top coat to come back in. For some dogs, weekly brushing will suffice. Most Border Terriers are seen groomed with short hair but longer hair can sometimes be preferred.|$|R
50|$|The Type 4's battery {{was located}} under the driver's seat (passenger seat on RHD models). All models {{featured}} ventless driver and front passenger windows, notched on their leading edge to provide draught-free ventilation, no cost metallic paint, radial ply tires, full carpeting, clock, electric rear window demister, flow-through ventilation, <b>undercoating,</b> <b>and</b> a thermostatically controlled auxiliary heating system, specifically, a gasoline-operated heater model BA4 by Eberspächer, fired by a glow plug accessible from a hidden rear window deck plate.|$|R
5000|$|Brittanys are {{generally}} healthy and hardy dogs. The median lifespan for Brittanys in France is 12.6 years. A UK Kennel Club survey puts the breed's median lifespan at 12 years 11 months, with about 1 in 5 dogs dying {{of old age}} {{at an average of}} 14-15 years. [...] Brittanys have no <b>undercoat</b> <b>and</b> need minimal grooming or bathing. However, their floppy ears tend to trap moisture in the ear canal and should be cleaned regularly.|$|R
5000|$|... ===Paint=== Paint was an {{important}} concern. Once bodywork was done, the cars were painted unusual colors. Transparent but wildly colored candy-apple paint, applied atop a metallic <b>undercoat,</b> <b>and</b> metalflake paint, with aluminum glitter within candy-apple paint, appeared in the 1960s. These took many coats to produce a brilliant effect - which in hot climates {{had a tendency to}} flake off. This process and style of paint job was invented by Joe Bailon, a customizer from Northern California.|$|R
500|$|The Norwegian Forest Cat is {{strongly}} built and larger than an average cat. Adult females {{of the species}} will typically weigh in at 3.5 - 4.5 kg (7.7 - 10 lbs), while males tends to weigh in at 5.5 to 7.5 kg (12 - 16.5 lbs) [...] The breed has a long, sturdy body, long legs and a bushy tail. The coat consists of a long, glossy, thick and water-repellent top layer <b>and</b> a woolly <b>undercoat</b> <b>and</b> is thickest at the legs, chest and head. The profile of the breed is generally straight.|$|R
50|$|The Finnish Spitz has {{a typical}} double coat, which {{consists}} of a soft, dense <b>undercoat</b> <b>and</b> long, harsh guard hairs that can measure one to two inches (2.5 to 5 cm) long. The outer coat should not exceed 2.5 in at the ruff. The coat should be stiffer, denser, and longer on the neck, back, back of thighs, and plume of the tail, shorter {{on the head and}} legs. Male dogs should sport a slightly longer and coarser coat than female ones, who have a slightly more refined coat.|$|R
50|$|The colour of the fur varies considerably, both between {{individuals}} {{and depending on}} season and subspecies. Northern populations, which usually are relatively small, are whiter, while southern populations, which typically are relatively large, are darker. This can be seen well in North America, where the northernmost subspecies, the Peary caribou, is the whitest and smallest subspecies of the continent, while the southernmost subspecies, the woodland caribou, is the darkest and largest. The coat has two layers of fur: a dense woolly <b>undercoat</b> <b>and</b> longer-haired overcoat consisting of hollow, air-filled hairs.|$|R
5000|$|They mostly have a white, silky, {{medium to}} long length coat, no <b>undercoat</b> <b>and</b> a fine bone structure. There {{seems to be}} a {{connection}} between the Angora Cats and Persians, and the Turkish Angora is also a distant cousin of the Turkish Van. Although they are known for their shimmery white coat, currently there are more than twenty varieties including black, blue and reddish fur. They come in tabby and tabby-white, along with smoke varieties, and are in every color other than pointed, lavender, and cinnamon (all of which would indicate breeding to an outcross.) ...|$|R
25|$|Oaxaca woodcarvings {{were all}} {{originally}} painted with aniline paints made with natural ingredients such as bark of the copal tree, baking soda, lime juice, pomegranate seeds, zinc, indigo, huitlacoche and cochineal. These colorings {{were also used}} for dying clothing, ceremonial paints and other uses. Since 1985, most carvers have now switched to acrylics which resist fading and withstand repeated cleanings better. However, some still use aniline paints as they have a more rustic look that some customers prefer. Either way, the painting is generally done in two layers, with a solid <b>undercoat</b> <b>and</b> a multicolored designed superimposed.|$|R
