50|$|The Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act is {{a federal}} law in the United States aimed at {{protecting}} consumers from telemarketing deception and abuse.The act is enforced by the Federal Trade Commission. The act expanded controls over telemarketing and gave more control to prescribe rules to the Federal Trade Commission. After {{the passage of the}} act, the Federal Trade Commission is required to (1) define and prohibit deceptive telemarketing practices; (2) keep telemarketers from practices a reasonable consumer would see as being coercive or invasions of privacy; (3) set restrictions on the time of day and night that unsolicited calls can be made to consumers; (4) to require the nature of the call to be disclosed at the start of any <b>unsolicited</b> <b>call</b> that is made with the purpose of trying to sell something.|$|E
5000|$|Mabe, {{based in}} Louisville, Kentucky, {{achieved}} notability with his prank responses to telemarketing calls. He kept recording equipment near his telephone, and upon receiving an <b>unsolicited</b> <b>call</b> would engage the telemarketer in an unexpected and often uncomfortable conversation while recording the incident. One {{of his best}} known pranks of this genre involved convincing a telemarketer that he had inadvertently called {{the scene of a}} homicide. [...] He has been featured on Drew & Mike in the Morning on WRIF numerous times and has released three comedy albums of his calls through Virgin Records Nashville. Mabe now operates a YouTube channel entitled [...] "MabeInAmerica" [...] onto which he uploads his pranks. His exploits now primarily focus on the candid camera style of pranking, although telemarketing related and other prank calls are still included on occasion. In 2008, Mabe was the Executive Producer, writer, and talent for the CMT (Country Music Television) comedy series, Mabe In America. Six episodes have been produced, including two [...] "best of" [...] shows that showcase his most popular features. He appeared in the second episode of CMT Comedy Stage.|$|E

50|$|Engine {{development}} on K 9 and K 10 started in August 2012 by GTRE. A tender of joint venture on {{development of the}} engine was issued to engine manufacturers in 2015 for a foreign partner to help in developing the engine by combining both Kaveri engine technology with the joint-venture partners engine to create a 110-125 KTN thrust engine. On 19 February 2015 at Aero India 2015 Tamilmani told reporters that a tender of joint venture on development of the engine was issued to General Electric, Rolls Royce, Snecma, Eurojet, NPO Saturn to use current engine technology by combining Kaveri engine technology with JV engine to produce an engine capable of producing thrust of 110-125 kN. Tamilmani confirmed the possibility of combining Kabini Core-engine with joint venture partner core engine i.e. with the EJ 200, Snecma M88, NPO Saturn AL-31-117 or General Electric F414 to produce 110-125 KN of thrust. France made an <b>unsolicited</b> <b>call</b> to help in development of AMCA's engine with full access to the Snecma M88 engine and other key technology, while United States has offered full collaboration in the engine development with full access to the GE F-414 and F-135. During U.S President Barack Obama's visit on 25-27 January he pointed out a possibility of joint-development of a Hot-Engine, an advanced variable cycle engine capable of performing in hot weather conditions like those of India. Rolls-Royce was also pushing a deal for a joint venture engine by offering the co-development of a new engine based on the Kaveri and EJ2XX engines. In November, during the visit of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to UK, Rolls-Royce again pushed the EJ2XX engine in a joint development proposal despite favouritism towards General Electric for a JV programme. In December U.S government made sign of support for full fledge transfer of technology including many classified information of F-414 engine in joint venture engine development. During Indian defence minister Manohar Parrikar's visit to the United States, the U.S defence secretary Ashton Carter and Parrikar discussed the matter of joint development of the engine.|$|E
30|$|The {{solution}} {{proposed in}} [5, 12] {{to this problem}} is that the first time a user receives an <b>unsolicited</b> <b>call,</b> the recipient, before accepting it, requests a payment whose amount is (very) small (micropayments), e.g., four cents. When the payment is made, the call is answered and the caller is included in a whitelist for future communications. Furthermore, the payment made by the caller could be refunded, with the caller and the recipient exchanging their roles. In the refund the recipient makes the payment and the caller receives it.|$|E
40|$|The {{status of}} weka on Mokoia Island was {{assessed}} in two ways: (1) by surveying {{the number of}} weka on the island using two methods: call broadcast and <b>unsolicited</b> <b>call</b> survey, and (2) by capturing weka. Using our call broadcast technique we have estimated the population of weka on the island between 90 and 120 birds. However, several areas of the island were not surveyed. We caught 12 birds in 19 days (1420. 5 cage/hrs). This catching success was low when compared to Owen 1998 (34 birds caught in 10 days). A possible explanation could be {{the availability of a}} great variety of foods {{at this time of the}} year compared with August, when Owen and collaborators were catching. We recommend that a monitoring programme for weka is established on Mokoia well in advance of mice eradication (currently scheduled for 2001) to allow the Department of Conservation to effectively measure the effect of the poisoning on the birds. Removing some weka, as was done prior to the first attempt to eradicate mice, is also recommended. Future studies of weka on Mokoia considered necessary include: feeding studies (food availability and use/preference), importance of habitat structure for weka, and breeding dynamics. 1...|$|E
