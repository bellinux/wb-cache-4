Both the Germans and Japanese tested such weapons against civilians and, sometimes on prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} before the {{beginning}} of the race, there was controversy over the first stage. On arriving at the start, the teams discovered that the route <b>used</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> of road surfaces, crossed sandy sections and included several ramps. As a result, the race organisers decided to neutralise the stage: the teams therefore competed only for the stage victory and for the team classification, not for the general classification.|$|E
5|$|Like the French, the German air {{services}} <b>used</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> {{of disruptive}} camouflage patterns until April 1917, when lozenge camouflage was introduced; it used {{up to five}} colors. German aircraft were however sometimes painted in deliberately conspicuous colors, like the bright red of Manfred von Richthofen's Albatros D.III, advertising the pilot's prowess to intimidate the enemy.|$|E

Though bioethicists academics <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> of media Geraghty and Parsi point out that this is usually in the expert role. This means the information presented by them is harnessed only for specific concerns taken out of the larger context.|$|R

However, the team <b>used</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> of kits including the claret and sky blue house colours of Thames Ironworks, as well as sky blue or white kit.|$|E
5|$|Due to a tight budget, Larkin {{was unable}} to hire an {{orchestra}} to perform the music; all the instruments in the soundtrack aside from Larkin's own trumpet playing are sampled instruments. Larkin <b>used</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> of synthesizers, samplers, and computers to create the score, working at his home studio and Cyan's offices. Larkin found that the biggest challenge with the score was finishing it on time for the game to ship. The soundtrack was released in CD format on October 25, 2005.|$|E
5|$|During {{the entire}} period of 1970–74, FRELIMO {{intensified}} guerrilla operations, specialising in urban terrorism. The use of landmines also intensified, with sources stating {{that they had}} become responsible for two {{out of every three}} Portuguese casualties. During the conflict, FRELIMO <b>used</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> of anti-tank and anti-personnel mines, including the PMN (Black Widow), TM-46, and POMZ. Even amphibious mines were used, such as the PDM. Mine psychosis, an acute fear of landmines, was rampant in the Portuguese forces. This fear, coupled with the frustration of taking casualties without ever seeing the enemy forces, damaged morale and significantly hampered progress.|$|E

5|$|Her {{journeys}} {{into the}} land of slavery put her at tremendous risk, and she <b>used</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> of subterfuges to avoid detection. Tubman once disguised herself with a bonnet and carried two live chickens to {{give the appearance of}} running errands. Suddenly finding herself walking toward a former owner in Dorchester County, she yanked the strings holding the birds' legs, and their agitation allowed her to avoid eye contact. Later she recognized a fellow train passenger as another former master; she snatched a nearby newspaper and pretended to read. Since Tubman was known to be illiterate, the man ignored her.|$|E
5|$|In May 2010, a new {{taxonomy}} of the Bivalvia {{was published in}} the journal Malacologia. In compiling this, the authors <b>used</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> of phylogenetic information including molecular analysis, anatomical analysis, shell morphology and shell microstructure as well as bio-geographic, paleobiogeographic and stratigraphic information. In this classification 324 families are recognized as valid, 214 of which are known exclusively from fossils and 110 of which occur in the recent past, with or without a fossil record. This classification has since been adopted by WoRMS.|$|E
5|$|Older {{models that}} used tube power {{amplifiers}} <b>used</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> of 6-pin connectors, while later models used a 9-pin connector. In all cases, {{for a single}} organ – Leslie configuration, the mains power, audio and control signals are all carried on the connector, and {{the design of the}} pin layouts varies between organs and speakers. Care must be taken when attempting to service them since an incorrectly or poorly wired cable can cause permanent damage to the organ and / or speaker, or result in electrocution. It is also possible to connect multiple Leslie speakers to a single organ, by using a power relay that provides the necessary AC current.|$|E

5|$|TISM have <b>used</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> {{of methods}} to conceal their identities. They have never officially {{revealed}} their names, instead choosing to use pseudonyms on their records and in interviews, {{all the while}} concealing their faces. Usually this involves the wearing of a balaclava, but outrageous costumes have been created for the purpose, including Ku Klux Klan uniforms made of newspaper, silver suits with puffy arms and legs to mimic an inflated cask wine bladder, giant foam paintings worn on the head, large foam signs bearing {{the name of a}} Beatle, fat 'businessman' suits, and eight-foot-high inflatable headpieces among others.|$|E
5|$|The {{park service}} gave {{priority}} {{to life and}} property {{in their efforts to}} suppress the fires. Of the more than 1,000 structures located in the park, only 67 were destroyed. There were 400 structures in the Old Faithful complex and only 19 of these were destroyed, 12 of which were concessionaire housing units and relatively inexpensive to replace. Major tourist locations in the park such as the one at Old Faithful were heavily staffed by fire fighting crews and equipment, especially at times of immediate danger. Fire fighters <b>used</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> of methods to establish safe zones in and near these complexes, yet every single visitor complex was evacuated by non-critical personnel at least once during the fires.|$|E

Show then performed another chokeslam on Guerrero to win the title.|$|E
5|$|When {{the initial}} request was refused, Ugartechea sent 100dragoons to {{retrieve}} the cannon. The soldiers neared Gonzales on September 29, but the colonists <b>used</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> of excuses {{to keep them from}} the town, while secretly sending messengers to request assistance from nearby communities. Within two days, up to 140 Texians gathered in Gonzales, all determined not to give up the cannon. On October 1, settlers voted to initiate a fight. Mexican soldiers opened fire as Texians approached their camp {{in the early hours of}} October 2. After several hours of desultory firing, the Mexican soldiers withdrew.|$|E
5|$|While Burrows' {{offensive}} numbers {{increased from}} {{playing on the}} top line, the Sedins' mutually benefitted from playing with him. Daniel and Henrik {{had not had a}} constant linemate on the first line since Anson Carter played with them in 2005–06. Since then, Vigneault had <b>used</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> of wingers, including Markus Naslund, Taylor Pyatt and Steve Bernier, to fill in the unit. In those years, Daniel and Henrik were point-a-game players; with Burrows on their line, they vaulted into top scorers in the league, as Henrik won the Art Ross Trophy as the league's leading point-getter (Daniel scored at a similar pace, but played less due to an injury).|$|E

5|$|Having become {{versed in}} Kuba {{language}} and culture, Sheppard took {{a team of}} men {{to the edge of}} Kuba territory in 1892. His original plan was to ask for directions to the next village under the guise of purchasing supplies, but the chief of the village only allowed one of his men to go. Sheppard <b>used</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> of tricks to make his way further into the kingdom, including having a scout follow a group of traders and, most famously, eating so many eggs that the townspeople could no longer supply him and his scout was able {{to gain access to the}} next village to find more eggs. Eventually, however, he encountered villagers that would allow him to go no further. While Sheppard was formulating a plan, the king's son, Prince N'toinzide, arrived and arrested Sheppard and his men for trespassing.|$|E
5|$|In September 1944, Flint Castle was {{assigned}} to Escort Group B3, which protected convoys sailing between St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, and Britain. The ship was refitted in Cardiff, Wales, in January–March 1945 and rejoined her group in Liverpool in April. She {{was assigned}} to Rosyth Command in June as an anti-submarine training ship and visited ports in Norway and Germany {{over the next several}} months. Flint Castle was transferred to the Rosyth Escort Force in June 1946, which was employed as a training unit; it was redesignated as the Basic Anti-Submarine Training Flotilla in September. The unit was then transferred to Portland and <b>used</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> of names before settling on the Second Training Squadron in January 1952. On 15 June 1953, she took part in the Fleet Review held at Spithead to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. The ship was used to portray a German anti-submarine vessel in the 1955 film The Cockleshell Heroes.|$|E
5|$|On January 3, 1861, Crittenden {{tried to}} salvage his plan by recommending {{to the full}} Senate that it be {{submitted}} {{to the people in}} referendum. It was widely believed that a referendum would recommend adoption of Crittenden's plan, and Republicans in Congress <b>used</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> of procedures to prevent a vote on allowing it. On January 16, with procedural delays exhausted, New Hampshire Senator Daniel Clark moved to substitute for Crittenden's plan a resolution stating that constitutional amendments were unnecessary to preserve the Union, and that enforcement of the Constitution and the present laws would eliminate the need for special sectional guarantees. With the senators from southern states (both those that had seceded and those that had not) refusing to vote, Republicans were left with a majority in the chamber and passed Clark's substitute resolution, effectively killing Crittenden's proposal.|$|E
