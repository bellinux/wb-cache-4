40|$|Background: Variations in origin, {{course and}} {{distribution}} of upper limb arteries are well documented {{and they have a}} great clinical significance. But the incidence of certain variations like presence of Superficial Brachioulnar Artery (SBUA) is less and its association with other vascular variations in hand are very few. Material: Human male cadaver of about 65 years age, received for student demonstration dissections provided the material for this study. Results & Observations: SBUA originated from brachial artery (BA) in the left upper limb of a human male cadaver. Other vascular variations noted were division of BA into radial artery (RA) and a common trunk (CT) for common interosseous and <b>ulnar</b> <b>recurrent</b> <b>arteries</b> (URA); and variant pattern in completion of Superficial Palmar arch (SPA). Conclusion: Arterial variations of upper limb have been reported to have clinical implications. A variant vessel like SBUA may be encountered during elevation of forearm flaps, or accidental injections of drugs into artery with mistaken identity for a vein, may land in severe complications. Added to these, knowledge of formation of palmar arterial arches and their branching pattern is important in reconstructive surgeries of hand...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{investigated}} the extraosseous and intraosseous arterial {{anatomy of the}} human adult elbow. Twenty-two fresh adult cadaveric upper ex-tremities were studied with a technique of combined India-ink and latex injection followed by chemical de-bridement. The intraosseous vascularity of twelve ex-tremities was then evaluated with a rapid Spalteholz clearing technique. Our findings demonstrated consis-tent patterns of extraosseous and intraosseous vascu-lar anatomy, which were organized into three vascular arcades: medial, lateral, and posterior. The medial ar-cade was formed by the superior and inferior ulnar collateral arteries and the posterior <b>ulnar</b> <b>recurrent</b> <b>artery.</b> The lateral arcade was formed by the radial and middle collateral, radial recurrent, and interosseou...|$|E

40|$|Cubital tunnel {{syndrome}} is {{often accompanied by}} paresthesia in ulnar nerve sites and hand muscle atrophy. When muscle weakness occurs, or after failure of more conservative treatments, anterior transposition is used. In the present study, the ulnar nerve and its blood vessels were examined in the elbows of 18 adult cadavers, and the external diameter of the nutrient vessels of the ulnar nerve {{at the point of}} origin, the distances between the origin of the vessels and the medial epicondyle of the humerus, and the length of the vessels accompanying the ulnar nerve in the superior ulnar collateral artery, the inferior ulnar collateral artery, and the posterior <b>ulnar</b> <b>recurrent</b> <b>artery</b> were measured. Anterior transposition of the vascularized ulnar nerve was performed to treat cubital {{tunnel syndrome}}. The most appropriate distance that the vascularized ulnar nerve can be moved to the subcutaneous tissue under tension-free conditions was 1. 8 ± 0. 6 cm (1. 1 - 2. 5 cm), which {{can be used as a}} reference value during the treatment of cubital tunnel syndrome with anterior transposition of the vascularized ulnar nerve...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{proximal}} {{ulnar artery}} has several branches, including perforators that are directly {{derived from the}} ulnar artery and anterior/posterior recurrent arteries. There {{are only a few}} reports of flaps that use the anterior/posterior recurrent arteries, and flaps employing their perforators as a main pedicle are yet to be reported. In this study, posterior <b>ulnar</b> <b>recurrent</b> <b>artery</b> perforator (PURAP) flaps were employed for elbow and forearm reconstruction. Methods: The 22 cases of reconstruction by PURAP flaps were analyzed in terms of the cause of injury, the recipient site, the vascular pedicle of the flap, flap size and survival, {{and the quality of the}} outcome. Donor-site morbidity, including the development of scars and numbness, was also evaluated. Results: All flaps were vascular pedicled island flaps. The perforator used was the medial and posterior perforator in 14 (63. 6 %) and 8 (36. 4 %) cases, respectively. The average flap size was 10 × 5 cm. Six months after the operation, the outcomes were judged to be excellent in 15 cases (68. 2 %), good in 6 cases (27. 3 %), and poor in 1 case (4. 5 %) because of partial necrosis of the distal part of the flap. Conclusions: PURAP flaps can be harvested with 2 types of perforator pedicles (the medial or posterior perforator) and offer greate...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The <b>recurrent</b> Heubner's <b>artery</b> is {{the distal}} {{part of the}} medial striate artery. Occlusion of the <b>recurrent</b> <b>artery</b> of Heubner, classically {{contralateral}} hemiparesis with fasciobrachiocrural predominance, is attributed to {{the occlusion of the}} <b>recurrent</b> <b>artery</b> of Heubner and is widely known as a stroke syndrome in adults. However, isolated occlusion of the deep perforating arteries following mild head trauma also occurs extremely rarely in childhood. CASE REPORT: Here we report the case of an 11 -year-old boy with pure motor stroke. The brain MRI showed an acute ischemia in the <b>recurrent</b> <b>artery</b> of Heubner supply area following mild head trauma. His fasciobrachial hemiparesis and dysarthria were thought to be secondary to the stretching of deep perforating arteries leading to occlusion of the <b>recurrent</b> <b>artery</b> of Heubner. CONCLUSION: Post-traumatic pure motor ischemic stroke can be secondary to stretching of the deep perforating arteries especially in childhood...|$|R

5000|$|The {{interosseous}} <b>recurrent</b> <b>artery</b> (or <b>recurrent</b> interosseous <b>artery)</b> is {{an artery}} of the forearm which {{arises from the}} posterior interosseous artery near its origin. It ascends to the interval between the lateral epicondyle and olecranon, on or through the fibers of the supinator but beneath the anconeus. It anastomoses with the middle collateral artery.|$|R
50|$|The {{posterior}} tibial <b>recurrent</b> <b>artery</b> (circumflex fibular artery), an inconstant branch, {{is given}} {{off from the}} anterior tibial before that vessel passes through the interosseous space.|$|R
5000|$|Radial <b>recurrent</b> <b>artery</b> - arises {{just after}} the radial artery comes off the brachial artery. It travels superiorly to anastomose with the radial {{collateral}} artery around the elbow joint ...|$|R
50|$|The arteries {{supplying}} the joint {{are derived from}} an extensive circulatory anastomosis between the brachial artery and its terminal branches. The superior and inferior ulnar collateral branches of the brachial artery and the radial and middle collateral branches of the profunda brachii artery descend from above to reconnect on the joint capsule, where they also connect with the anterior and posterior <b>ulnar</b> <b>recurrent</b> branches of the ulnar artery; the radial recurrent branch of the radial artery; and the interosseous recurrent branch of the common interosseous artery.|$|R
50|$|The {{circumflex}} fibular artery (circumflex fibular branch, circumflex {{branch of}} posterior tibial <b>artery,</b> posterior tibial <b>recurrent</b> <b>artery,</b> or circumflex peroneal branch of posterior tibial artery) is {{a branch of}} the posterior tibial artery which supplies blood to the knee.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{study the}} {{vascular}} pattern of proximal fibula {{with use of}} embalmed cadaveric specimens. Material and Method: The present study was done on 33 lower extremities from 19 embalmed human, adult cadavers. The average ages of the cadavers were 68. 6 years (range from 36 to 98 years), 11 females and 8 males. The size and site of vessels around the proximal fibula were recorded. Results: There were three main blood supplies of proximal fibular, the epiphyseal artery, the lateral genicular artery, and the periosteal blood supply. They are anterior tibial <b>recurrent</b> <b>artery</b> and posterior tibial artery or artery of the neck of fibula posteriorly. Inferior lateral genicular artery was seen in all specimens (33 / 33). Among them, 42. 4 % (14 / 33) had a single artery with double accompanied veins. The average diameter of artery and veins were 1. 71 mm (0. 75 - 2. 25), and 1. 69 mm (1. 30 - 2. 10), respectively. The others were single artery and single vein. The average diameter of artery and veins were 1. 66 mm (0. 65 - 2. 14), and 2. 1 mm (0. 95 - 2. 30) respectively. Anterior tibial <b>recurrent</b> <b>artery</b> was seen in 31 of 33 specimens (94 %). The average size of artery and accompanying vein were 1. 24 mm (0. 8 - 2. 1), and 1. 86 mm (0. 8 - 2. 6), respectively. Posterior tibial <b>recurrent</b> <b>artery</b> was an inconsistent branch that appeared in only 11 of 33 specimens (33 %). Artery of the neck of fibula appeared in 24 of 33 specimens (72. 7 %). The others were replaced by the predominant posterior tibial <b>recurrent</b> <b>artery</b> (7 / 33) and neither of them was found in two specimens...|$|R
5000|$|The medial {{collateral}} artery (also {{known as}} the middle collateral artery) is a branch of profunda brachii artery that descends in the middle head of the triceps brachii and assists in forming the anastomosis with the interosseous <b>recurrent</b> <b>artery</b> above the olecranon of the ulna near the elbow.|$|R

30|$|The {{variations}} of the AccMCA express the phylogenetic origins of the MCA {{from a group of}} vessels with similar potentials {{in the early stages of}} evolution, including the <b>recurrent</b> <b>artery</b> of Heubner (RAH). Therefore, a distal ACA origin of the AccMCA corresponds to an enlarged RAH. This was described by Manelfe in 1977 as type 3, where the AccMCA is a Heubner artery with an extensive cortical supply, arising from the proximal part of the A 2 segment [20].|$|R
