40|$|A noncryogenic, S-band {{parametric}} amplifier {{operating in the}} 2. 2 to 2. 3 GHz band and having an average input noise temperature of less than 30 K was built and tested. The {{parametric amplifier}} module occupies a volume of less than 1 - 1 / 4 cubic feet and weighs less than 60 pounds. The module is designed for use in various NASA ground stations to replace larger, more complex cryogenic units which require considerably more maintenance because of the cryogenic refrigeration system employed. The amplifier can be located up to 15 feet from the power supply unit. Optimum performance was achieved {{through the use of}} high-quality <b>unpackaged</b> (<b>chip)</b> varactors in the amplifier design...|$|E

With ultrasonic bonding, <b>unpackaged</b> <b>chips</b> attached to soft circuit boards.

40|$|We {{present the}} {{monolithic}} integration of deepsubmicrometer complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) microchips with copper indium gallium (di) selenide (CIGS) solar cells. Solar cells are manufactured directly on <b>unpackaged</b> CMOS <b>chips.</b> The microchips maintain comparable electronic performance, and the solar cells on top show an efficiency of 8. 4 ± 0. 8 % and a yield of 84 %, both values {{being close to}} the glass reference. The main integration issues, i. e., adhesion, surface topography, metal ion contamination, process temperature, and mechanical stress, can be resolved while maintaining standard photovoltaic processing. A tight process window is found for the manufacturing of CIGS solar cells on the CMOS side of the microchip. More process margin exists for backside integration...|$|R
40|$|Most cryptosystems are {{designed}} and evaluated at a mathematical level. Attackers, however, will always target the physical realisation {{of a system}} {{which is much more}} complicated (see [14] for discussion of this disconnect). Real-world electronic implementations of ciphers will usually leak additional information to attackers in the form of side-channels such as timing, power consumption, electromagnetic radiation, heat, noise, and more. In many cases, an attacker can combine side-channel information with the observed input and/or output of a cryptographic algorithm to recover secret information. It is important to draw a distinction between side-channel cryptanalysis and related physical attacks. Compromising Emanation attacks or tempest attacks utilise electromagnetic emanations from computers to recover secret data, for example using electromagnetic radiation from a computer screen to recover the text being displayed [11] (for a survey, see chapter 17 of [1]). Tempest attacks target secret information directly, completely bypassing the cryptographic keys. Invasive or semi-invasive attacks, in contrast, involve physical manipulation of a target system to extract secret information, for example by <b>unpackaging</b> a <b>chip</b> and reading secret data stored in its memory using a micro-probe or a microscope (see [4, 2] for a survey of physical attacks and defences). In contrast, side-channel attack present a unique challenge in that an attacker gains some additiona...|$|R
40|$|Fluxless {{soldering}}, i. e. residue free soldering {{with the}} aid of gaseous activation is known for many years, but only well established in the field of opto-and microwave electronics. In low cost high volume applications this technology has not yet become mainstream. In the fluxless soldering the wetting of the solder is made possible by means of an activating process gas. After the soldering process, no cleaning process is necessary because no corrosive residues are left on the circuit boards and components. Therefore soldering using solder paste without aggressive chemical ingredients has a high market potential. Expensive preforms could be replaced by paste dispensing or paste printing. In this paper, a residue free SnAgCu solder paste and a suitable soldering process is developed and presented. It is applied on high power ceramic LED packages and <b>unpackaged</b> flip <b>chip</b> LEDs which can be assembled directly on a substrate. In this paper the main paste properties such as printability of a commercial flux solder paste with those of the fluxless solder paste are compared. Likewise, the soldering results after a reflow process of these different paste systems are evaluated and compared. Different solder joint analysis methods like X-Ray, the transient thermal analysis, cross section and shear strength tests are presented in this paper. Finally a measurement technique to detect contamination on a soldered module is shown. There is a possibility that the concept and process proposed and demonstrated in this paper can reduce the production costs of electronic systems and improve the quality of soldered electronic modules...|$|R
