2500|$|The USAAF {{ended the}} factory-applied {{camouflage}} on all aircraft produced after 13 February 1944, {{and the first}} <b>unpainted</b> <b>block</b> 21 [...] "razorback" [...] canopy and block 25 [...] "bubble-top" [...] canopy models arrived in May. The first [...] "silver" [...] aircraft, 42-26044, was left uncamouflaged, given the name Silver Lady, and flown in combat by Capt. James Carter and Major Les Smith of the 61st FS. The first bubbletops, dubbed [...] "Superbolts", {{were assigned to the}} group and squadron commanders until more became available.|$|E
5|$|Also {{constructed}} were a small fuel store, workshop, paint {{store and}} earth closet near the keeper's cottage, and two fuel stores with earth closet and sink for the assistant cottages. All were {{constructed in the}} same form, from <b>unpainted</b> concrete <b>blocked</b> and the same terracotta tile roofs. All still remain in the complex, pretty much intact.|$|R
5000|$|In the 2000 model year, a new version, the X4 LD ("Low Down"), was introduced. It {{offered a}} {{slightly}} lower seat and overall frame, improved suspension (with [...] "piggyback"-style Showa rear shock absorbers), and minor cosmetic differences including an <b>unpainted</b> engine <b>block</b> (versus {{the black of}} the original) and lightweight latticework inner rotors on the front brakes (the originals were solid discs).|$|R
25|$|The archways {{between the}} nave and chapel and vestry {{either side of}} the {{crossing}} are in-filled with stained timber boarding, to the south to the spring-line of the arch and to the north to door head height. The chapel is open to {{the main body of the}} church and its ceiling corresponds to the lower line of the in-fill panel, while the vestry is separated by a stained timber panel wall and a central door. The chapel and vestry have concrete floors, <b>unpainted</b> concrete <b>block</b> walls and stained timber ceilings.|$|R
50|$|Memorial Gym is {{well known}} for its unusual design. The end-of-the-floor bench {{location}} is now unique in major college basketball, and said to give Vanderbilt a home court advantage, since no other facility in which opponents play is arranged in such a way. The interior walls were <b>unpainted</b> cinder <b>blocks</b> prior to a major renovation in the early 2000s. The middle of the three decks has a low ceiling and when the house lights are turned off during game play gives the distinct impression of watching a Cinemascope movie of basketball.|$|R
500|$|The {{accommodations}} in {{the complex}} consist of a lightkeepers cottage with garden and Assistant Keeper's duplex, both constructed from concrete <b>blocks,</b> <b>unpainted</b> from construction, and originally having [...] "Marseilles pattern" [...] terracotta tile roofs. The keeper's cottage includes an open verandah on three sides, with cast iron posts and curved timber beams. The hipped roof is still the original terracotta tiles and one chimney remains. As for the duplex, circa 1970 the roof was replaced with concrete tiles and the chimneys have been demolished.|$|R
5000|$|There {{is a large}} supper room on {{the ground}} floor which is used for a variety of social events. The floor above has been braced by {{inserting}} a grid of large steel [...] "I" [...] beams below the ceiling of this room. The upper floor is reached by decorative timber stairs and contains an anteroom leading into the lodge room. This is very intact and appears to retains its original furniture. Modern facilities have been housed in additions rather than in the main building. A small timber kitchen annexe with a lean-to roof has been added to the rear south east corner and on the north west side of the building there is a 2-storey addition constructed of <b>unpainted</b> concrete <b>blocks.</b> It is affixed to the temple, but the original wall and windows have not been removed or altered. This contains toilets, a small kitchenette on the upper floor and storage space.|$|R
2500|$|The {{designs of}} the wooden churches were clearly {{influenced}} by the church architecture from central and southern Europe as well as Russia, with cruciform plans and Gothic, Romanesque and Renaissance features and detailing. These influences most often, however, came via Sweden. The development {{of the wooden}} church in Finland is marked by greater complexity in the plan, the increased size and the refinement of details. The [...] "Lapp church" [...] of Sodankylä (c. 1689), Finland's best-preserved and least changed wooden church, is a simple, <b>unpainted</b> rectangular saddle-back-roofed <b>block,</b> measuring 13 x 8,5 metres with the walls rising to 3,85 metres, and resembling a peasant dwelling. By contrast, Petäjävesi church (planned and built by master builder Jaakko Klemetinpoika Leppänen, 1765) plus the additional sacristy and belfry (Erkki Leppänen, 1821) (a World Heritage Site), though also unpainted on the exterior, has a refined cross plan with even-sized arms, 18 x 18 metres, with a 13-metre-tall interior wooden vault. The atmosphere of the interior of Petäjävesi church is regarded as unique; the large windows, unusual for log construction, give it a soft light.|$|R
40|$|Efficacy of {{chlorine}} dioxide (CD) gas generated by two distinct generation systems, Sabre (wet system with gas generated in water) and ClorDiSys (dry system with gas generated in air), was evaluated for inactivation of Bacillus anthracis spores on six building interior surfaces. The six building materials included carpet, acoustic ceiling tile, <b>unpainted</b> cinder <b>block,</b> painted I-beam steel, painted wallboard, and unpainted pinewood. There was {{no statistically significant}} difference in the data due to the CD generation technology at a 95 % confidence level. Note that a common method of CD gas measurement was used for both wet and dry CD generation types. Doses generated by combinations of different concentrations of CD gas (500, 1, 000, 1, 500, or 3, 000 parts per million of volume [ppmv]) and exposure times (ranging between 0. 5 and 12 h) were used to evaluate the relative role of fumigant exposure period and total dose in the decontamination of building surfaces. The results showed that the time required to achieve at least a 6 -log reduction in viable spores is clearly a function of the material type on which the spores are inoculated. The wood and cinder block coupons required a longer exposure time to achieve a 6 -log reduction. The only material showing a clear statistical difference in rate of decay of viable spores as a function of concentration was cinder block. For all other materials, the profile of spore kill (i. e., change in number of viable spores with exposure time) was not dependent upon fumigant concentration (500 to 3, 000 ppmv). The CD dose required for complete spore kill on biological indicators (typically, 1 E 6 spores of Bacillus atrophaeus on stainless steel) was significantly less than that required for decontamination of most of the building materials tested...|$|R
40|$|Chlorine dioxide gas and vaporous {{hydrogen}} peroxide sterilant {{have been used}} in the cleanup of building interiors contaminated with spores of Bacillus anthracis. A systematic study, in collaboration with the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, was jointly undertaken by the U. S. Army-Edgewood Chemical Biological Center to determine the sporicidal efficacies of these two fumigants on six building structural materials: carpet, ceiling tile, <b>unpainted</b> cinder <b>block,</b> painted I-beam steel, painted wallboard, and unpainted pinewood. Critical issues related to high-throughput sample processing and spore recovery from porous and nonporous surfaces included (i) the extraction of spores from complex building materials, (ii) the effects of titer challenge levels on fumigant efficacy, and (iii) the impact of bioburden inclusion on spore recovery from surfaces and spore inactivation. Small pieces (1. 3 by 1. 3 cm of carpet, ceiling tile, wallboard, I-beam steel, and pinewood and 2. 5 by 1. 3 cm for cinder block) of the materials were inoculated with an aliquot of 50 μl containing the target number (1 × 106, 1 × 107, or 1 × 108) of avirulent spores of B. anthracis NNR 1 Δ 1. The aliquot was dried overnight in a biosafety cabinet, and the spores were extracted by a combination of a 10 -min sonication and a 2 -min vortexing using 0. 5 % buffered peptone water as the recovery medium. No statistically significant drop in the kill efficacies of the fumigants was observed when the spore challenge level was increased from 6 log units to 8 log units, even though a general trend toward inhibition of fumigant efficacy was evident. The organic burden (0 to 5 %) in the spore inoculum resulted in a statistically significant drop in spore recovery (at the 2 or 5 % level). The effect on spore killing was a function of the organic bioburden amount and the material type. In summary, a high-throughput quantitative method was developed for determining the efficacies of fumigants, and the spore recoveries from five porous materials and one nonporous material ranged between 20 and 80 %...|$|R
