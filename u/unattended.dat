5|$|By 1914, {{just before}} the start of World War I, Paoli lost his voice and all of the major opera houses in Europe were shut down. Paoli moved to Spain, a neutral country in the conflict, leaving all his {{properties}} <b>unattended</b> in Italy.

5|$|Eggs {{are taken}} {{by a number of}} mammals, {{including}} American mink, striped skunk, otters, foxes and racoons, with the latter being responsible for nearly 40% of all nest failures. Birds such as herring gulls, northern ravens and American crows will eat <b>unattended</b> eggs. Because their nests are at the water's edge, common loon eggs are especially vulnerable if the adult is absent.|$|E
5|$|The {{other major}} fire {{located in the}} {{northern}} section of the park was the Hellroaring fire. Started in Gallatin National Forest on August 15 from embers from an <b>unattended</b> campfire, the fire initially moved north, but then turned around {{a few days later}} and moved south, threatening the area near Tower Junction.|$|E
5|$|Cylinders {{should not}} be left {{standing}} <b>unattended</b> unless secured {{so that they can}} not fall in reasonably foreseeable circumstances as an impact could damage the cylinder valve mechanism, and conceivably fracture the valve at the neck threads. This is more likely with taper thread valves, and when it happens most of the energy of the compressed gas is released within a second, and can accelerate the cylinder to speeds which can cause severe injury or damage to the surroundings.|$|E
5|$|Fishing gear is {{the biggest}} threat to loggerheads in the open ocean. They often become {{entangled}} in longlines or gillnets. According to the 2009 status review of loggerheads by the Fisheries Service, drowning from entanglement in longline and gillnet fishing gear is the turtles’ primary threat in the North Pacific. They also become stuck in traps, pots, trawls, and dredges. Caught in this <b>unattended</b> equipment, loggerheads risk serious injury or drowning. Turtle excluder devices for nets and other traps reduce the number being accidentally caught.|$|E
5|$|Lyon {{thought he}} could teach Yagan British ways and convert him to Christianity. He hoped to gain his {{cooperation}} and use his tribal stature to persuade the Noongar to accept colonial authority. Lyon spent many hours with Yagan learning his language and customs. After a month, Yagan and his companions escaped by stealing an <b>unattended</b> dinghy and rowing to Woodman Point on the mainland. The Government did not pursue them; apparently its officials considered they had been sufficiently punished.|$|E
5|$|Recorded {{announcements}} {{are frequently}} made to remind passengers to report suspicious activity {{and not to}} leave their belongings <b>unattended.</b> Digital closed-circuit cameras (CCTVs) have been upgraded with recording-capability at all stations and trains operated by SMRT Corporation. Trash bins and mail boxes {{have been removed from}} station platforms and concourse levels to station entrances, to eliminate the risk of bombs planted in them. Photography without permission was also banned in all MRT stations since the Madrid bombings, but it was not in the official statement in any public transport security reviews.|$|E
5|$|Some biographers' {{accounts}} {{speculated that}} the opportunity for {{one or more of}} the guards to rescue a survivor existed. Yakov Yurovsky demanded that the guards come to his office and turn over items they had stolen following the murder. There was reportedly a span of time when the bodies of the victims were left largely <b>unattended</b> in the truck, in the basement and in the corridor of the house. Some guards who had not participated in the murders and had been sympathetic to the grand duchesses were reportedly left in the basement with the bodies.|$|E
5|$|The Australian magpie {{is almost}} {{exclusively}} diurnal, {{although it may}} call into the night, like some {{other members of the}} Artamidae. Natural predators of magpies include various species of monitor lizard and the barking owl. Birds are often killed on roads or electrocuted by powerlines, or poisoned after killing and eating house sparrows or mice, rats or rabbits targeted with baiting. The Australian raven may take nestlings left <b>unattended.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{macaroni}} penguin's predators {{consist of}} birds and aquatic mammals. The leopard seal (Hydrurga leptonyx), Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella), Subantarctic fur seal (A. tropicalis), and killer whale (Orcinus orca) sometimes hunt adult macaroni penguins in the water. Colonies suffer low rates of predation if undisturbed; predators generally only take eggs and young that have been left <b>unattended</b> or deserted. Skua species, the snowy sheathbill (Chionis alba), and kelp gull (Larus dominicanus) prey on eggs, and skuas and giant petrels also sometimes take chicks.|$|E
5|$|The modern Saluki has {{retained}} qualities of hunting hounds and may seem reserved to strangers. The often independent and aloof breed {{may be difficult}} to train. Training methods should always be gentle and patient. Salukis may bore easily and are not an ideal breed to leave <b>unattended</b> for long periods. The Saluki does not typically enjoy rough games or activities such as retrieving balls. Early socialization will help prevent timidity and shyness in later life. Given its hunting instincts, the dog is prone to chasing moving objects.|$|E

5|$|After the Ottoman defeat, {{the fleet}} was laid {{up at the}} Golden Horn and left largely <b>unattended</b> for the {{following}} twenty years. During this period of inactivity, Mesudiye received a minor modernization at the Tersâne-i Âmire shipyard on the Golden Horn. At {{the start of the}} Greco-Turkish War in February 1897, Mesudiye was found to be unfit for combat, as were most of the other major warships of the fleet. On 15 May Mesudiye and several other warships attempted to hold a training exercise, which only highlighted the poor state of training of the ships' crews.|$|E
5|$|As on 31 March 2015, the Company has a {{total of}} 1306 coaches (220 trains). Apart from {{extensions}} on various existing lines, two new lines viz. Line 7 & 8 are proposed in Phase III. 486 coaches (81 six-car trains) being procured for these two new lines will have advance feature of <b>Unattended</b> Train Operation (UTO). Additional 258 Broad gauge (BG) coaches for Line 1 to 4 and 138 Standard Gauge (SG) coaches for Line 5 & 6 are proposed to be procured for augmentation/extensions to cater to the increased traffic. Resultantly, {{at the end of}} Phase III, there would be 2188 coaches (333 trains). Barring a few 4-car trains on Line 5, 93% of the trains would operate either in 6 car or 8 car configuration at the end of Phase III.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to safety design, new security measures will be implemented. All vehicles will be screened for radioactive materials and other potentially dangerous objects before {{they enter the}} site through the underground road. Four hundred closed-circuit surveillance cameras will be placed {{in and around the}} site, with live camera feeds being continuously monitored by the NYPD. A computer system will use video-analytic computer software, designed to detect potential threats, such as <b>unattended</b> bags, and retrieve images based on descriptions of terrorists or other criminal suspects. New York City and Port Authority police will patrol the site.|$|E
5|$|PerdiccasII {{sided with}} Sparta in the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC) between Athens and Sparta, and in 429 BC Athens retaliated by persuading Sitalces to invade Macedonia, {{but he was}} forced to retreat owing to a {{shortage}} of provisions in winter. In 424 BC, Arrhabaeus, a local ruler of Lynkestis in Upper Macedonia, rebelled against his overlord Perdiccas, and the Spartans agreed to help in putting down the revolt. At the Battle of Lyncestis the Macedonians panicked and fled before the fighting began, enraging the Spartan general Brasidas, whose soldiers looted the <b>unattended</b> Macedonian baggage train. Perdiccas then changed sides and supported Athens, {{and he was able to}} put down Arrhabaeus's revolt.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes may kill small mustelids like weasels, stone martens, pine martens, stoats, kolonoks, polecats {{and young}} sables. Eurasian badgers may live {{alongside}} red foxes in isolated sections of large burrows. It {{is possible that}} the two species tolerate each other out of mutualism; foxes provide badgers with food scraps, while badgers maintain the shared burrow's cleanliness. However, cases are known of badgers driving vixens from their dens and destroying their litters without eating them. Wolverines may kill red foxes, often while the latter are sleeping or near carrion. Foxes in turn may kill <b>unattended</b> young wolverines.|$|E
5|$|The {{bodies were}} then put into trucks and {{were taken to}} a large burial pit, where they were left <b>unattended</b> long enough for Jednak to escape. It is {{estimated}} that 200 Serbs were killed that evening. Killings continued on 3 August, when the Ustaše murdered the inhabitants of Serb villages {{in the vicinity of}} the church. About one month later, the church was burned down by the Ustaše. Estimates of the number of Serbs killed from 30 July to 3 August vary widely. Sociologist Damir Mirković and historian Paul Mojzes state that 700 Serbs were killed. Journalist Tim Judah puts the number at 1,200, and historian Iván T. Berend writes that the Ustaše killed 1,800 people. Hoare writes that as many as 2,000 Serbs were murdered.|$|E
5|$|The {{frustration}} at #1 Records obstructed sales contributed to tension within the band. There was physical fighting between members: Bell, after being {{punched in the}} face by Hummel, retaliated by smashing Hummel's new bass guitar to pieces against the wall. Hummel took revenge at a later date: finding Bell's acoustic guitar in the latter's <b>unattended</b> car, he repeatedly punched it with a screwdriver. In November 1972, Bell quit the band. When work continued on songs for a second album, Bell rejoined, but further conflict soon erupted. A master tape of the new songs inexplicably went missing, and Bell, whose heavy drug intake was affecting his judgment, attacked Fry's parked car. In late 1972, struggling with severe depression, Bell quit the band once more, {{and by the end}} of the year Big Star disbanded.|$|E
5|$|When {{the first}} traffic flowed, crews had not {{finished}} some final tasks, such as painting stripes. Motorists saw a relocation with several mountain cuts built high up the canyon wall, {{with a view}} of the slide and former lake. The roadbed was not expected to last, as weather conditions had been unfavorable when the asphalt was laid. Two mountain cuts were unstable, requiring several months of work before they could be left <b>unattended.</b> During this time, the state stationed two full-time watches at the cuts, who would close the road while falling rocks were cleared. The cut through Billies Mountain was described by the construction crews as a new, man-made mountain pass.|$|E
5|$|While traveling, Weed {{meets his}} other brother, Joe. First Joe dislikes Gin for leaving Sakura <b>unattended</b> in the Alps. He is unaware that Sakura had left Ōu under the false {{impression}} that Gin was dead, and that Gin had been unaware of Sakura's leaving. Joe explains {{that a large}} hybrid bear has attacked and killed his mate, Hitomi. Weed's group joins Joe to defeat the animal. During the battle, GB dies saving Weed, and Weed vows to avenge him. Weed knocks himself and the bear into a river. The bear dies after hitting a floodgate and Weed manages to survive. He returns to Ōu and learns that his mate, Koyuki, is pregnant. Weeks later, she gives birth to four pups.|$|E
5|$|A {{trail of}} {{peculiar}} footprints shows the path trodden {{by the woman}} on her pattens to avoid putting her good shoes {{in the snow and}} filth of the street. A small object hangs at her side, interpreted variously as a nutcracker or a pair of scissors {{in the form of a}} skeleton or a miniature portrait, hinting, perhaps, at a romantic disappointment. Although clearly a portrait in the painting, the object is indistinct in the prints from the engraving. Other parts of the scene are clearer in the print, however: in the background, a quack is selling his cureall medicine, and while in the painting the advertising board is little more than a transparent outline, in the print, Dr. Rock's name can be discerned inscribed on the board below the royal crest which suggests his medicine is produced by royal appointment. The salesman may be Rock himself. Hogarth's opinion of Rock is made clear in the penultimate plate of A Harlot's Progress where he is seen arguing over treatments with Dr Misaubin while Moll Hackabout dies <b>unattended</b> in the corner.|$|E
5|$|On July 28, 1928 William S. Grattan {{responded to}} the oil barge James F. Cahill, loaded with 5,000 barrels of crude oil, that was aflame. After burning 17 hours, the barge's mooring lines gave way and the barge began to drift. William S. Grattans crew {{attempted}} to attach tow lines to the drifting barge but it struck a dock at an oil company where the empty oil tanker B.B. McColl was moored. The fumes on the B.B. McColl ignited causing an explosion and fire that engulfed William S. Grattan. Captain Thomas Hylant along with his crew abandoned ship and swam through the flames to shore. Chief Engineer Thomas Lynch of William S. Grattan lost his life and seven other crew members were injured. The <b>unattended</b> boilers on William S. Grattan soon ran dry and exploded, leaving the ship burned out and heavily damaged.|$|E
5|$|The German {{flotilla}} {{had reached}} home ports {{on the evening}} of the 12 February. However, while the threat from RAF bombers in daylight had now gone, Bomber Command was soon making night bombing attacks on Kiel’s port. Gneisenau was moved into an inner basin alongside her depot ship, Monte Olivia. The hatches were left open and her tanks, still containing a large amount of fuel, were left <b>unattended.</b> RAF Bomber Command made its first attack {{on the night of the}} 25/26 February, when 61 bombers flew over Kiel. Monte Olivia was destroyed but Gneisenau escaped. On 26/27 February another 61 RAF bombers returned. A bomb penetrated Gneisenaus foredeck and exploded. The oil fumes from the tanks ignited and the ship was engulfed in fire from her bow to the Anton turret. The entire forward part of the bow needed to be replaced. She steamed to Gdynia, in Poland on 4 April where she was decommissioned out of range of RAF bombers. Gneisenau did not put to sea again. The raid cost three aircraft, one Hampton and two Wellingtons. German casualties amounted to 16 civilians and 116 sailors dead.|$|E
5|$|Meryl gets a {{voicemail}} from Sully, and Veronica {{agrees to}} track her. Veronica and Keith have another fight, with Veronica insulting his character {{for having a}} relationship with Harmony. Veronica and Meryl track the cell phone in the Fitzpatricks’ bar. Liam Fitzpatrick drunkenly picks up Veronica and carries her around, but Vinnie supposedly takes {{a picture of it}} to get him off her. Veronica and Meryl go to the police station and find that Sully washed up on shore after surfing with a bump on his head and had mild amnesia. While cleared, Mercer is still being held in custody. Keith rejects Harmony, and Logan nervously calls Keith for the whereabouts of Veronica. At the food court, Veronica is listening to voicemails from Logan and Keith when she notices an issue with her food. She returns to the counter with her plate, leaving her drink <b>unattended.</b> She returns to her seat but, after eating and drinking, soon feels disoriented. She recognizes this feelings as identical to her experience after ingesting GHB previously. Veronica attempts to get into her car and collapses just outside of it but she manages to set off the alarm. A mysterious figure appears and stops the alarm. There is a buzzing sound the scene cuts to a nearby Logan hearing the alarm. Logan finds Veronica's car with her unconscious on the ground next to it. He picks her up to reveal some locks of Veronica's hair on the ground and a bald spot {{on the back of her}} head.|$|E
5|$|Only part of Captain King’s force, {{including}} 35 of Lieutenant Angus's 70 sailors, {{succeeded in}} making a landing at the Red House. Under fire from the defenders, the invaders charged Lieutenant Lamont’s detachment of the 49th Regiment. The sailors, armed with pikes and swords, closed in for hand-to-hand fighting. Lamont's troops drove back the attackers three times but King made a fourth assault which hit the British left flank and overwhelmed them; capturing Lamont and killing, taking or dispersing all of his men. The victorious Americans {{set fire to the}} post, spiked the guns and set off back to the landing-point, where they expected their boats to have re-landed in order to evacuate them. However, in the moonless darkness, King’s force became dispersed and split into two parties: one led by King and the other by Lieutenant Angus. Angus returned to the landing-point and found only four of the party’s ten boats there. Unaware that the six missing boats had not in fact landed, Angus assumed that King had already departed, and he re-crossed the river in the remaining boats. When King’s party reached the landing-point, they found themselves stranded. A search downriver found two <b>unattended</b> British boats, in which King sent half of his men, and the prisoners that he had captured, over the Niagara while he waited with his 30 remaining men for more boats to come from Buffalo and pick him up.|$|E
5|$|Procellariids {{begin to}} attend their nesting colony around one month prior to laying. Males will arrive first and attend the colony more {{frequently}} than females, partly {{in order to protect}} a site or burrow from potential competitors. Prior to laying there is a period known as the pre-laying exodus in which both the male and female are away from the colony, building up reserves in order to lay and undertake the first incubation stint respectively. This pre-laying exodus can vary in length from 9 days (as in the Cape petrel) to around 50 days in Atlantic petrels. All procellariids lay one egg per pair per breeding season, in common {{with the rest of the}} Procellariiformes. The egg is large compared to that of other birds, weighing 6–24% of the female's weight. Immediately after laying the female goes back to sea to feed while the male takes over incubation. Incubation duties are shared by both sexes in shifts that vary in length between species, individuals and even the stage of incubation. The longest recorded shift was 29 days by a Murphy's petrel from Henderson Island; the typical length of a gadfly petrel stint is between 13 and 19 days. Fulmarine petrels, shearwaters and prions tend to have shorter stints, averaging between 3 and 13 days. Incubation takes a long time, from 40 days for the smaller species (such as prions) to around 55 days for the larger species. The incubation period is longer if eggs are abandoned temporarily; procellariid eggs are resistant to chilling and can still hatch after being left <b>unattended</b> for a few days.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} ways in which this biparental sex role specialization can be influenced was studied by manipulating the presence and absence of the mate as well as the presence and absence of an intruder. The former variable was considered because the specialization of parental roles only occurs when both parents are present, while the latter variable was considered because it is thought that biparental care in these cichlids was an evolutionary consequence of the protection of offspring from intruders. When both mates are present with no intruder, both parents may stay with the offspring by resembling single parents because each parent is addressing only the offspring and not its mate, or one parent may be concentrated on activities associated with the offspring while the other parent concentrates on patrolling and defending the area. Under these isolated conditions, a more equal sharing of parental behaviors tends to occur. However, when both mates are present and an intruder is introduced, the male spends more time chasing intruders while the female remains with the offspring more. When the intruder is present but a parent is by itself, the widowed male tends to leave the offspring <b>unattended</b> and instead attacks the intruder or predator. Therefore, the conclusive finding is that the male rarely remains with the offspring when the female is absent, and the female rarely confronts the intruder when the male is absent.|$|E
5|$|The most {{pressing}} threat for many species, particularly the smaller ones, comes from species introduced to their colonies. Procellariids overwhelmingly breed on islands away from land predators such as mammals, {{and for the}} most part have lost the defensive adaptations needed to deal with them (with the exception of the oil-spitting fulmarine petrels). The introduction of mammal predators such as feral cats, rats, mongooses and even mice can have disastrous results for ecologically naïve seabirds. These predators can either directly attack and kill breeding adults, or, more commonly, attack eggs and chicks. Burrowing species that leave their young <b>unattended</b> at a very early stage are particularly vulnerable to attack. Studies on grey-faced petrels breeding on New Zealand's Whale Island (Moutohora) have shown that a population under heavy pressure from Norway rats will produce virtually no young during a breeding season, whereas if the rats are controlled (through the use of poison), breeding success is much higher. That study also highlighted the role that non-predatory introduced species can play in harming seabirds; introduced rabbits on the island caused little damage to the petrels, other than damaging their burrows, but they also acted as a food source for the rats during the non-breeding season, which allowed rat numbers to be higher than they otherwise would be, resulting in more predators for the petrels to contend with. Interactions with introduced species can be quite complex. Gould's petrels breed only on two islands, Cabbage Tree Island and Boondelbah Island off Port Stephens (New South Wales). Introduced rabbits destroyed the forest understory on Cabbage Tree Island; this both increased the vulnerability of the petrels to natural predators and left them vulnerable to the sticky fruits of the birdlime tree (Pisonia umbellifera), a native plant. In the natural state these fruits lodge in the understory of the forest, but with the understory removed the fruits fall to the ground where the petrels move about, sticking to their feathers and making flight impossible.|$|E
