This effectively tailors the films to be highly sensitive to spatial magnetic field distributions.

5000|$|The popular {{explanation}} for the advantage of perpendicular recording is that it achieves higher storage densities by aligning the poles of the magnetic elements, which represent bits, perpendicularly {{to the surface of}} the disk platter, as shown in the illustration. In this not-quite-accurate explanation, aligning the bits in this manner takes less platter than what would have been required had they been placed longitudinally. This means cells can be placed closer together on the platter, thus increasing the number of magnetic elements that can be stored in a given area. The true picture is a bit more complex, having to do with the use of a magnetically [...] "stronger" [...] (higher coercivity) material as the storage medium. This is possible because in a perpendicular arrangement the magnetic flux is guided through a magnetically soft (and relatively thick) underlayer underneath the hard magnetic media films (considerably complicating and thickening the total disk structure). This magnetically soft underlayer can be effectively considered a part of the write head, making the write head more efficient, thus making it possible to produce a stronger write field gradient with essentially the same head materials as for longitudinal heads, and therefore allowing for the use of the higher coercivity magnetic storage medium. A higher coercivity medium is inherently thermally more stable, as stability is proportional to the product of bit (or magnetic grain) volume times the <b>uniaxial</b> <b>anisotropy</b> constant Ku, which in turn is higher for a material with a higher magnetic coercivity.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the specific heat C_V at constant volume {{and effects of}} <b>uniaxial</b> <b>anisotropy</b> of a p-wave attractive interaction in the normal state of an ultracold Fermi gas. Within {{the framework of the}} strong-coupling theory developed by Nozières and Schmitt-Rink, we evaluate this thermodynamic quantity as a function of temperature, in the whole interaction regime. While the <b>uniaxial</b> <b>anisotropy</b> is not crucial for C_V in the weak-coupling regime, C_V is found {{to be sensitive to the}} <b>uniaxial</b> <b>anisotropy</b> in the strong-coupling regime. This originates from the population imbalance among p_i-wave molecules (i=x,y,z), indicating that the specific heat is a useful observable to see which kinds of p-wave molecules dominantly exist in the strong-coupling regime when the p-wave interaction has <b>uniaxial</b> <b>anisotropy.</b> Using this strong point, we classify the strong-coupling regime into some characteristic regions. Since a p-wave pairing interaction with <b>uniaxial</b> <b>anisotropy</b> has been discovered in a ^ 40 K Fermi gas, our results would be useful in considering strong-coupling properties of a p-wave interacting Fermi gas, when the interaction is uniaxially anisotropic.
