500|$|No {{one in my}} {{large family}} wrote poetry. But the first Russian woman poet, Anna Bunina, was the aunt of my {{grandfather}} Erasm Ivanovich Stogov. The Stogovs were modest landowners in the Mozhaisk region of the Moscow Province. They were moved here after the insurrection {{during the time of}} Posadnitsa Marfa. In Novgorod they had been a wealthier and more distinguished family. Khan Akhmat, my ancestor, was killed one night in his tent by a Russian killer-for-hire. Karamzin tells <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> marked the end of the Mongol yoke on Russia. [...] It was well known that this Akhmat was a descendant of Genghiz Khan. In the eighteenth century, one of the Akhmatov Princesses – Praskovia Yegorovna – married the rich and famous Simbirsk landowner Motovilov. Yegor Motovilov was my great-grandfather; his daughter, Anna Yegorovna, was my grandmother. She died when my mother was nine years old, and I was named in her honour. Several diamond rings and one emerald were made from her brooch. Though my fingers are thin, still her thimble didn't fit me.|$|E
500|$|After what he {{felt was}} a period of bad episodes {{culminating}} with [...] "Stranger in a Strange Land", critic Andrew Dignan of Slant Magazine praised [...] "Tricia Tanaka Is Dead" [...] as a [...] "palate cleanser, reminding <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> show is meant to be, above all else, fun". He described the episode as an [...] "expected pleasure, disarming in a way [...] hasn't been since Season One, back before these people became jaded by [...] "Others" [...] and consumed with tedious busy work while the show's producers figured out what frequently disappointing direction to push them in next." [...] Dignan did however acknowledge that others might not have found the episode as enjoyable as he did. Erin Martell of TV Squad wasn't sure what to think of the episode, believing that it was [...] "entertaining" [...] but produced nothing new for viewers. She did note that the characters are now in place to take action for following episodes, and hoped that the episode's [...] "slow-moving events" [...] were [...] "building up to some serious resolution". Rather than dismiss the episode for lacking a mythology-related storyline, Jeff Jensen from Entertainment Weekly called it [...] "a joyous and poignant hour of television", and said that it [...] "could very well be a cleverly crafted allegory for the history of The Dharma Initiative on The Island." ...|$|E
500|$|Hilary Hughes from USA Today {{also noticed}} Gaga's vocal range, {{especially}} during the acoustic interpretation of [...] "Dope" [...] and [...] "Just Dance".

[...] Hardeep Phull from New York Post appreciated the stage setup and the homage to old New York industrial setting and gave positive feedback for Gaga's choice to be an entertainer with the performances of [...] "You and I", [...] "Just Dance", and [...] "Applause". Jordan Runtagh from VH1 applauded Gaga's camaraderie with her fans, also noting that [...] "the abundance of movie cameras reminded <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was a special moment, one that will go down in history. And not just because these are the last performances at this storied venue. It's something more." [...] Runtagh believed that the performances solidified Gaga as a respectable entertainer and would generate further interest for the upcoming [...] tour. Amanda Holpuch from The Guardian complimented Gaga's vocals and her outfits, but felt that the show lacked [...] "something outrageous" [...] from the singer. She added that the most surprising incident of the night was when Gaga climbed a ladder to reach the mezzanine floors and sing from there.|$|E

It looks fantastic, doing its level best to {{recreate}} 1940s New York on what is probably quite a low budget, and succeeding. It ties into the MCU in ways that feel natural ...There isn't a weak performance in the cast, and even the writing is strong, with compelling plots giving space to subplots which chug along at a nice pace. And the most surprising part? It's actually funny." [...] He was positive about Atwell's performance, but praised D'Arcy as [...] "the breakout star of the cast". Amy Ratcliffe of Nerdist concluded her review of the episode saying [...] "Overall, Agent Carter didn’t {{open the door and}} tiptoe in; it busted through and took charge. Atwell is a magnetic force of nature and seems completely at home in the role, and she’s complemented by D’Arcy and Gjokaj." [...] She also felt that lessons had been learned from Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and thought that all the work put into creating the period setting had paid off. Britt Hayes, reviewing for Screen Crush, felt that the episode [...] "fumbles a little, as most series do when they’re introducing us to a new world", but was positive of Atwell, D'Arcy, and the cinematography. Hayes' major issue was the score, which she explained [...] "often lingers a little too long and feels slightly tone deaf—it definitely cheapens the proceedings, and reminds <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is television, not film." ...|$|E
500|$|Heffron became Premier, being {{sworn in}} with his cabinet on 23 October 1959 at Government House, Sydney by Governor Sir Eric Woodward. However, his time as Premier was marked by {{significant}} tensions within the Labor Party in NSW and nationally, where although a split involving the Democratic Labor Party had been avoided during Cahill's term, the sectarian and factional undercurrent in the party was very much present in what was increasingly perceived as a tired and divided government. Indeed, the 68-year-old Heffron's government consisted mostly of MPs and Ministers who had come in with McKell after the 1941 election. In parliament, Heffron tended to reflect this by leaving most of the speaking roles to his deputy Jack Renshaw and local government and highways minister Pat Hills. It was clear to many that the aged Heffron's best days as a politician were behind him, as future Labor political advisor Richard Hall noted in The Bulletin: [...] "In the House he tends to ramble on, recalling past glories as Minister for Education or Minister for Emergency Services in answer to questions. In an age where clichés cloak most politicians, Heffron throws them out {{as though they were}} devastating retorts, although occasionally the old radical has shown his teeth, flashed into anger, and for a few minutes reminded <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was the great mob-orator who led many bitter strikes." [...] His old nemesis Jack Lang also took the opportunity to take a last swipe at him, ridiculing Heffron in his newspaper, Century, as [...] "Mr Magoo". On 14 October 1960, Heffron presided over the official opening of Warragamba Dam, the completion of which meant that it became the primary reservoir and the first reliable water supply for the whole Sydney catchment. At the opening, Heffron declared: [...] "We have come along way from the Tank Stream, Sydney's first water supply".|$|E
500|$|Immanuel Kant, {{a central}} figure of the Age of Enlightenment, {{likewise}} claimed that two things filled his mind with ever new and increasing admiration and awe, the oftener and more steadily they were reflected on: [...] "the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me... the latter begins from my invisible self, my personality, and exhibits me in a world which has true infinity but which I recognise myself as existing in a universal and necessary (and not only, as in the first case, contingent) connection." [...] The 'universal connection' referred to here is Kant's categorical imperative: [...] "act only according to that maxim by which you can {{at the same time}} will that it should become a universal law." [...] Kant considered critical conscience to be an internal court in which our thoughts accuse or excuse one another; he acknowledged that morally mature people do often describe contentment or peace in the soul after following conscience to perform a duty, but argued that for such acts to produce virtue their primary motivation should simply be duty, not expectation of any such bliss. Rousseau expressed a similar view that conscience somehow connected man to a greater metaphysical unity. John Plamenatz in his critical examination of Rousseau's work considered that conscience was there defined as the feeling that urges us, in spite of contrary passions, towards two harmonies: the one within our minds and between our passions, and the other within society and between its members; [...] "the weakest can appeal to it in the strongest, and the appeal, though often unsuccessful, is always disturbing. However, corrupted by power or wealth we may be, either as possessors of them or as victims, there is something in us serving to remind <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> corruption is against nature." ...|$|E
