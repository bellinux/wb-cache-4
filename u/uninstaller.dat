2500|$|On November 15, 2005, Felten and J. Alex Halderman {{showed that}} Sony's method for {{removing}} XCP copy protection software {{from the computer}} makes it more vulnerable to attack, as it essentially installed a rootkit, {{in the form of}} an Active X control used by the <b>uninstaller,</b> and left it on the user's machine and set so as to allow any web page visited by the user to execute arbitrary code.

2500|$|Sony BMG quickly {{released}} {{software to}} remove the rootkit component of XCP from affected Microsoft Windows computers, but after Russinovich analyzed the utility, he reported in his blog that it only exacerbated the security problems and raised further concerns about privacy. Russinovich noted that the removal program merely unmasked the hidden files installed by the rootkit, but did not actually remove the rootkit. He also reported that it installed additional software {{that could not be}} uninstalled. In order to download the <b>uninstaller,</b> he found it was necessary to provide an e-mail address (which the Sony BMG Privacy Policy implied was added to various bulk e-mail lists), and to install an ActiveX control containing backdoor methods (marked as [...] "safe for scripting", and thus prone to exploits).|$|E

During this time, 180solutions' applications were designed {{to be difficult to}} <b>uninstall,</b> requiring the user to download an additional <b>uninstall</b> application made by 180solutions or to use an adware removal tool.
