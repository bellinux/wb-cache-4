50|$|Louis Kahn (1901-74) {{was another}} American {{architect}} who {{moved away from}} the Mies van der Rohe model of the glass box, and other dogmas of the prevailing international style. He borrowed {{from a wide variety of}} styles, and idioms, including neoclassicism. He was professor of architecture at Yale University from 1947-57, where his students included Eero Saarinen. From 1957 until his death he was professor of architecture at the University of Pennsylvania. His work and ideas influenced Philip Johnson, Minoru Yamasaki, and Edward Durell Stone as they moved toward a more neoclassical style. <b>Unlike</b> <b>Mies,</b> he did not try to make his buildings look light; he constructed mainly with concrete and brick, and made his buildings look monumental and solid. He drew from a wide variety of different sources; the towers of Richards Medical Research Laboratories were inspired by the architecture of the Renaissance towns he had seen in Italy as a resident architect at the American Academy in Rome in 1950. Notable buildings by Kahn in the United States include the First Unitarian Church of Rochester, New York (1962); and the Kimball Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas (1966-72). Following the example of Le Corbusier and his design of the government buildings in Chandigarh, the capital city of the Haryana & Punjab State of India, Kahn designed the Jatiyo Sangshad Bhaban (National Assembly Building) in Dhaka, Bangladesh (1962-74), when that country won independence from Pakistan. It was Kahn's last work.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the influence of}} traditional Japanese culture and related 'Oriental' concepts in European Modern architecture, with particular consideration {{of the work of}} Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Alvar Aalto. The study is organised into six chapters, the first of which addresses the concept of influence, its direct and indirect modes of operation in architecture and the issues associated with Far Eastern sources. In the second chapter, the availability of information on Japanese architecture in Europe from the mid-nineteenth century through {{to the start of the}} Second World War is discussed, with reference to publications, exhibitions and architectural theory. In the following two chapters, the work of Mies is considered in the light of this available material. Although commentators have frequently referred to similarities between his buildings and Japanese precedent, direct connections have rarely been proposed. Consideration of the context in which he practised, however, reveals the availability of significant material related to the philosophical and conceptual basis of Japanese architecture, which, it is argued, finds various forms of expression in his work. In the case of Aalto, whose work is discussed in the final two chapters, parallels with Japanese precedent have been more readily identified by critics, with further examination of his context revealing an active interest in Japanese architecture and culture. <b>Unlike</b> <b>Mies,</b> who appears to have referred predominantly to conceptual sources, a more direct assimilation of the physical characteristics of Japanese buildings may be identified in Aalto's work. On the basis of this research, further conclusions have been drawn regarding the nature and effect of influence in architecture, most notably in relation to the 'anxiety' of influence experienced by practising architects, the significance of context, and the tension between traditional notions of influence and the broader understanding of 'intertextuality'.

40|$|The position-specific (PS) integrins of Drosophila are {{homologous}} {{in structure}} and function to vertebrate integrins, a family of transmembrane receptors that facilitate mechanical linkage and signal transduction between extracellular molecules and the cytoskeleton. Most integrins, including PS integrins, are receptors for components of the extracellular matrix. Integrins are αβ heterodimers, and structural domains within both subunits typically influence ligand specificity. PSI and PS 2 integrins are composed of unique α subunits, α(PS 1) or α(PS 2), and share a common β subunit (β(ps)). myospheroid (mys) encodes β(ps), and the characterization of mys phenotypes indicates that PS integrins function during tissue morphogenesis; e. g., PS integrins are required for adhesion of embryonic muscles to their body wall attachments, and for adhesion between the two surfaces of the pupal wing blade. During metamorphosis, the flat bilayered adult wing blade is formed from a single layered larval wing disc, and removal of PS integrins from this process causes wing "blisters". Since wing morphogenesis is a lengthy and dynamic process, the temporal requirement for integrin function was unclear. Using heatshock inducible mys+ transgenes, the wing blister phenotype of animals with compromised integrin function was rescued. By varying the times of transgene induction, I find that integrin function is required from very early in metamorphosis until at least the last 24 - 48 hours of wing development. Since the inflated (if) gene encodes α(PS 2), characterization of if phenotypes promised to reveal the developmental requirements specific for PS 2. New if lethal alleles were generated and found to retain little or no wildtype UPS 2 function. As seen for mys mutants, if mutant embryos show extreme defects in somatic muscle attachments and in midgut morphogenesis. <b>Unlike</b> <b>mys,</b> however, there is no dorsal herniation in if mutant embryos. With respect to wing morphogenesis, clonal analysis experiments demonstrate that if+ function is required only in cells of the ventral wing surface. To examine the in vivo functions of distinct integrin structures, transgenes were created to express either PS 2 subtype, PS 2 m 8 or PS 2 c. I find that PS 2 m 8 or PS 2 c rescues the if- muscle phenotype. In contrast, ectopic PS 2 m 8 (but not PS 2 c) activity dominantly disrupts wing morphogenesis...|$|R

We learned the next week that Michael had Prader-Willi syndrome. Michael's first problem was with eating.

50|$|In 1960, Morton Scholnick, who had {{developed}} Ann Arbor's Huron Towers, engaged Gunnar Birkerts, a Latvian-born modern architect, and Frank Straub to design an ultra-luxury apartment {{building on a}} site originally projected for a Mies highrise.

The structural columns are both irrregular and asymmetrical on the north and the south sides and follow the room boundaries of the bedrooms in units (1-3 bedrooms) and studio apartments. <b>Unlike</b> the <b>Mies</b> structures, 1300 Lafayette East was designed in the New Formal style of modern architecture and so features a subtle gable detail and places the building on a podium, which contains a two-story underground garage, on top of which are trees and a garden space.
