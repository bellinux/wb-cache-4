25|$|It was the {{intention}} to build an <b>urban</b> <b>motorway</b> in Liverpool. The M62 was intended to terminate at Liverpool's Inner Motorway, which was not built. The proposed route would have followed the railway into Liverpool as far as Edge Hill, with junctions at Rathbone Road and Durning Road where it would drop to two lanes before terminating at the Islington Radial. Difficulties arose building the Liverpool <b>urban</b> <b>motorway</b> resulting in delays, with the section between Tarbock and Liverpool the last {{to be completed in}} 1976. In total, two viaducts, ten bridges and seven underpasses were constructed to secure the structural integrity of the surrounding residential areas. The motorway was constructed only as far as the Queens Drive inner ring road, which is junction 4.|$|E

40|$|To ensure higher Level of Service (LoS) at <b>urban</b> <b>motorways,</b> new {{traffic control}} {{concepts}} are being applied since {{in most cases}} there is no available space for infrastructural build-up. For <b>urban</b> <b>motorways,</b> the mostly used control methods are ramp metering combined with additional control methods like variable speed limit control (VSLC). This paper gives {{a review of the}} current ramp metering approaches with special emphasis on cooperative control concepts between ramp metering, VSLC, prohibiting lane changes system and the vehicle itself. Additionally, a learning framework for ramp metering proposed by the authors is described. The CTMSIM Matlab based macroscopic motorway simulator with ramp metering control support is used for the simulation of selected ramp metering approaches. The simulator is also augmented to enable {{the development and implementation of}} cooperative ramp metering approaches. The Zagreb bypass is used as test case for evaluation of several different ramp metering algorithms. </p...|$|R
25|$|Parts of the route, at the {{northern}} end between Hackney Wick and Old Ford {{and south of the}} river between the Blackwall Tunnel and the Sun-in-the-Sands interchange, were previously classified as <b>urban</b> <b>motorways</b> and given the designation A102(M).

25|$|At Ngauranga, SH 1 {{becomes the}} Wellington <b>Urban</b> <b>Motorway,</b> {{skirting}} {{the shore of}} the harbour then passing the city centre to the west. The motorway ends at Te Aro, where a one-way system takes traffic to the Basin Reserve. Northbound traffic uses the Wellington Inner City Bypass (opened 2007), while southbound traffic uses Vivian Street. From the Basin Reserve, SH 1 travels through the Mount Victoria Tunnel to Wellington's eastern suburbs and Wellington International Airport. SH 1 ends at a roundabout {{at the entrance to the}} airport.|$|E
25|$|Esher is an {{outlying}} {{suburb of}} London, and with Esher Commons at its southern end, the town marks one {{limit of the}} Greater London Built-Up Area. Esher has a linear commercial high street and is otherwise suburban in density, with varying elevations, few high rise buildings and very short sections of dual carriageway within the ward itself. Esher covers a large area, between 13 and 15.4 miles southwest of Charing Cross. In the south it is bounded by the A3 Portsmouth Road which is of <b>urban</b> <b>motorway</b> standard and buffered by the Esher Commons.|$|E
25|$|Leeds is the starting-point of the A62, A63, A64, A65 and A660 roads, {{and is also}} {{situated}} on the A58 and A61. The M1 and M62 intersect to its south and the A1(M) passes to the east. Leeds {{is one of the}} principal hubs of the northern motorway network. Additionally, there is an <b>urban</b> <b>motorway</b> network; the radial M621 takes traffic into central Leeds from the M62 and M1. There is an Inner Ring Road with part motorway status and an Outer Ring Road. Part of the city centre is pedestrianised, and is encircled by the clockwise-only Loop Road.|$|E

25|$|Wellington {{is served}} by State Highway 1 {{in the west and}} State Highway 2 in the east, meeting at the Ngauranga Interchange north of the city centre, where SH 1 runs through the city to the airport. Road access into the capital is {{constrained}} by the mountainous terrain – between Wellington and the Kapiti Coast, SH 1 travels along the Centennial Highway, a narrow section of road, and between Wellington and Wairarapa SH 2 transverses the Rimutaka Ranges on a similar narrow winding road. Wellington has two motorways, both part of SH 1: the Johnsonville–Porirua Motorway and the Wellington <b>Urban</b> <b>Motorway,</b> which in combination with a small non-motorway section in the Ngauranga Gorge connect Porirua with Wellington city.|$|E
25|$|The {{final section}} of the M1 was opened to Junction 1 at Staples Corner in 1977. There the {{motorway}} meets the North Circular Road (A406) at a grade separated junction and roundabout. Unrealised plans made in the 1960s {{would have seen the}} motorway continue through the junction on an elevated roadway to end at West Hampstead where it would have met the North Cross Route, the northern {{section of the}} London Motorway Box, a proposed ring of <b>urban</b> <b>motorway</b> around the central area. The layout of the Staples Corner junction was originally built in accordance with these plans although most of the London Ringways Plan had been cancelled by 1973. Around the same time the section between the M10 and Junction 5 was widened from the original two lanes to three.|$|E
500|$|The {{northbound}} carriageway {{passes the}} entrance to Scratchwood, an area of ancient forest which is now a local nature reserve, then crosses the A411 from Watford to Barnet at the Stirling Corner roundabout. A [...] proposed link road at this roundabout, estimated at £22.8m in 1987, would have provided access to the M1, but the plans were subsequently abandoned. The link had been planned during discussions for the Hendon <b>Urban</b> <b>Motorway,</b> which was intended to carry the M1 {{all the way down}} to Hyde Park Corner as part of the London Ringways scheme; the interchange would have been junction 3 on the motorway; which is currently the unnumbered junction for London Gateway services.|$|E

30|$|Since its beginning, {{road traffic}} has {{increased}} tremendously leading to congestion, safety problems {{and environmental issues}} [20, 21]. Today, <b>urban</b> <b>motorways</b> {{around the world are}} experiencing daily congestion during peak-hours. Hence, {{there is a need for}} traffic management aiming at reducing the congestion and thereby increasing both efficiency and safety. One commonly applied traffic management system for <b>urban</b> <b>motorways</b> is variable speed limit (VSL) systems. VSL systems make use of a control algorithm to adjust the speed limit based on the prevailing road and traffic conditions. Coordinated variable speed limits are shown on a series of variable message signs along the managed road. Information about traffic conditions is collected using detectors often measuring local speed, flow or detector occupancy. A suitable variable speed limit is calculated by the control algorithm taking into account downstream and upstream traffic conditions. The purpose of a variable speed limit system can be to increase safety, increase efficiency and/or decrease environmental impacts, and hence, the specific purpose is reflected in how the control algorithm is designed.|$|R

Following the creation of the Greater London Council, she became chair of the housing committee with responsibility for around 200,000 homes. During opposition (1967-1973), she became Labour's deputy leader on the Council, before serving as chair of the transport committee from 1973 to 1975, establishing free buses for pensioners and stopping the construction of <b>urban</b> <b>motorways</b> in London.|$|R
500|$|A {{pneumatic}} railway {{was briefly}} trialled {{in the area}} in 1864. [...] Once the railways had arrived, Crystal Palace was eventually served by two railway stations, the high level and low level stations, built to handle the volume of passengers visiting the Crystal Palace. [...] After the palace was destroyed by fire, and with railway travel declining, passenger numbers fell and the high level station was closed in 1954 and demolished 7years later. [...] Rail services gradually declined, and for a period in the 1960s and 1970s there were plans to construct an <b>urban</b> <b>motorway</b> through the area as part of the London Ringways plan. [...] With rising passenger numbers, additional London Overground services began stopping at the station and a major station redevelopment in 2012 led to proposals to extend the Croydon Tramlink service to the railway and bus stations. In 2016, Crystal Palace was named {{as one of the best}} places to live in London.|$|E
500|$|The Ringways scheme met {{considerable}} opposition; {{there were}} protests when the Westway, an <b>urban</b> <b>motorway</b> elevated over {{the streets of}} Paddington, was opened in 1970, with local MP John Wheeler later describing the road's presence within 15 metres of properties as [...] "completely unacceptable environmentally," [...] and the Archway Road public inquiry was repeatedly abandoned during the 1970s {{as a result of}} protests. By 1974, the Greater London Council announced it would not be completing Ringway 1. [...] The first Link Road Action Group to resist the M11 link road was formed in 1976, and for the next fifteen years activists fought government plans through a series of public inquiries. Their alternative was to build a road tunnel, leaving the houses untouched, but this was rejected on grounds of cost. [...] Drivers travelling in the areas where the new roads would have been built had to continue using long stretches of urban single-carriageway roads. In particular, the suburbs of Leyton, Leytonstone and Wanstead suffered serious traffic congestion.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{a new project}} was created in {{addition}} to those that had been developed in the northern city areas which consisted of reclaiming land from the river in front of the old “Costanera Sur” Riverside Resort. The land-filling started in 1978 using the Dutch “polder” system; embankments were built using debris from demolitions carried out to construct <b>urban</b> <b>motorways.</b> As the zone within the embankments filled with silt from the river, the water confined inside was drained, though this work was not fully completed.|$|R
50|$|In 1987 the {{government}} announced a {{plan to build a}} new bridge across the Lagan connecting the M2 directly to the A2. It was built in two stages: the Lagan Bridge section connecting to the M2 opened on 22 January 1995 while the link to the A2 opened three years later in May 1998. The route was designated as the M3, although it is not the same scheme as the one originally expected to be the M3. Construction of this road was unusual as government policy was against the construction of new <b>urban</b> <b>motorways.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The airport {{lies at the}} {{southern}} end of the North Island section of State Highway 1, which connects the airport to Wellington City via the Mount Victoria Tunnel. SH 1 then continues to the Wellington <b>Urban</b> <b>Motorway,</b> which takes traffic out of the city and further afield to Porirua and the Hutt Valley, and on to the Kapiti Coast and the Wairarapa. The distance from the airport to the city centre is roughly [...] Several taxi and shuttle companies serve the airport.|$|E
2500|$|The M621 is an {{internal}} <b>urban</b> <b>motorway.</b> [...] Much {{of it is}} the former M1 (until it was diverted as the South East Leeds Orbital linking the M1 and A1(M)).

[...] Since the M1 diversion the motorway has increased in length, previously it only ran from Birstall as far as the city centre. The M62 and M1 collectively create a part-orbital motorway around the south and east of the city.|$|E
2500|$|In 1960, the City Council's urban plan {{established}} {{a need for}} a motorway, a part of which would be routed through the cemetery. Seven years later, the City Council passed an act to build a motorway through the park. As a result, the cemetery was closed as a burial ground from March 1967 through 1971. The historic cemetery, bisected by the Wellington <b>Urban</b> <b>Motorway,</b> caused extensive controversy at the time. The new motorway opened in 1978, and in the same year, the Wellington City Council Parks renamed the cemetery as the Bolton Street Memorial Park. [...] Though the Friends of Bolton Street protested against the shifting of the graves, they did not stop construction of the road but ensured that the cemetery got a heritage status and the park got a reserve nomenclature. In spite of protests, about 3,700 graves were exhumed and relocated, most of whom were re-interred in a large vault beneath the park's lawn.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the second}} defeat in 1970 Goodwin became more {{aggressive}} in his opposition to Sir Desmond Plummer's Conservative GLC. Labour had not opposed the Conservative GLC's policy of building <b>urban</b> <b>motorways</b> in 1970 but by June 1972 Goodwin had been convinced by the strength of public opinion, and said [...] "Labour pledges itself to abandon the disastrous plans to build two motorways which threaten the environment of Central London". He called on the GLC not to enter into contracts to build the motorways so that Londoners could have a choice at the 1973 elections.|$|R
2500|$|Events took over, and two {{elections}} were fought in 1964 and 1966 with transport {{as a major}} election issue, resulting in a new Wilson government with Barbara Castle as Minister of Transport. A large majority enabled her to bring into law {{a number of the}} then-controversial safety concepts that the RRL had been investigating, such as speed limits and breathalyzers. She appeared to become an advocate of road pricing per the Smeed Report and publicly criticised the construction of new <b>urban</b> <b>motorways</b> as [...] "self-defeating", during a tour of US cities, slowing down the UK's future urban road building programme as a consequence.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, an {{analysis}} of driver behaviour is reported focusing on car following separation at low speed traffic conditions.
