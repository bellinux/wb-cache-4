The conditions for the occurrence of stress corrosion cracking were known and can be controlled. Since the use of liquid ammonia widened beyond the chemical industry, it was planned to investigate the so far unknown corrosion behaviour of the low-alloyed steels 13 CrMo 44 (W. Nr. 1. 7335) and 15 Mo 3 (W. Nr. 1. 5415), {{as well as the}} <b>unalloyed</b> <b>steel</b> StE 460 (W. Nr. 1. 8905) for comparison. The steels were characterized by polarization curves in pure liquid ammonia. As a rule, the corrosion current density in the passive state was lower for the welding than for the base steel. In the active state the welding of the low-alloyed steels corroded faster than the welding of the <b>unalloyed</b> <b>steel.</b> In the transition zone between the welding and the heat affected zone of the base steel corrosion was nonuniform. Among the pure components of the steels, chromium and molybdenum could be passivated. Nickel and manganese only corroded in the active state.

The highest susceptibility was observed at electrode potentials {{in the middle of the}} passive region. Additions of water exceeding about 100 ppm favoured stress corrosion cracking.

A resulting surface reaction {{leading to the}} formation of a corrosion-inhibiting vivianite layer was accompanied by a characteristic electrochemical potential (E) curve. First, E increased slightly due to the interaction of phosphate with the iron oxides covering the steel surface. Subsequently, E decreased rapidly and after 1 day reached − 510 mV, the potential of free iron, indicating the removal of the iron oxides. At this point, only scattered patches of bacteria covered the surface. A surface reaction, in which iron was released and vivianite precipitated, started. E remained at − 510 mV for about 2 days, during which the vivianite layer grew steadily. Thereafter, E increased markedly to the initial value, and the release of iron stopped. Changes in E and formation of vivianite were results of bacterial activity, with oxygen consumption by the biofilm being the driving force.

The high silicon content of the FCI leads to the formation of a phase free from Al and saturated in Si.

40|$|The {{utilization}} of {{aluminum die casting}} as enclosures where internal equipment is rotating inside of the casting and could fracture requires a strong housing to restrain the fractured parts. A typical example would be a supercharger. In case of a failure, unless adequately contained, fractured parts could injure people operating the equipment. A number of potential reinforcement materials were investigated. The initial work was conducted in sand molds to create experimental conditions that promote prolonged contact of the reinforcing material with molten aluminum. Bonding of Aluminum bronze, Cast iron, and Ni-resist inserts with various electroplated coatings and surface treatments were analyzed. Also toughening of A 354 aluminum cast alloy by steel and stainless steel wire mesh with various conditions was analyzed. A practical approach to reinforcement of die cast aluminum components {{is to use a}} reinforcing steel preform. Such performs can be fabricated from steel wire mesh or perforated metal sheet by stamping or deep drawing. A hemispherical, dome shaped casting was selected in this investigation. A deep drawing die was used to fabricate the reinforcing performs. The tendency of aluminum cast enclosures to fracture could be significantly reduced by installing a wire mesh of austenitic stainless steel or a punched austenitic stainless steel sheet within the casting. The use of reinforcements made of austenitic stainless steel wire mesh or punched austenitic stainless steel sheet provided marked improvement in reducing the fragmentation of the casting. The best strengthening was obtained with austenitic stainless steel wire and with a punched stainless steel sheet without annealing this material. Somewhat lower results were obtained with the annealed punched stainless steel sheet. When the annealed 1020 steel wire mesh was used, the results were only slightly improved because of the lower mechanical properties of this <b>unalloyed</b> <b>steel.</b> The lowest results were obtained with unreinforced 356 aluminum casting. Good strength can be obtained with a sound die casting without any defects produced by squeeze casting. The use of higher pressure to produce the squeeze casting has been shown to increase the strength of a hemispherical dome casting. This dome shape casting has been produced both with and without reinforcement and tested to determine its pressure resistance under internal pressure of water. Only a slight improvement in strength could be determined because of water leaks at the seal between hemispherical dome and its flat supporting side. However, when the ability of the casting was tested under the compressive force of a plunger, the strengthening effect of wire mesh or sheet was evident. Higher loads to failure were obtained because of the reinforcement of the stainless steel wire and punched sheet. Rather than a sudden failure occurring, the reinforcement of the stainless steel wire or the punched hard stainless steel sheet held the material together and prevented any loss of the fractured casting to the surroundings. <b>Unalloyed</b> <b>steel</b> did not have the required strength or mechanical properties to increase the properties of the casting...|$|E

In this case laser cutting and welding are often used to give a final shape to functional components. The same physical mechanism in the cut formation at both steels, however, resulted in a considerable different cut quality, which was indicated by the AE signals captured after the cutting process. Further on, an application of AE measurement during laser cutting of a larger deep-drawn product, where the magnitude of residual stresses and, consequently, because of cutting, relaxation and distortion of the cut part are important, is shown...|$|E
40|$|In {{paper is}} {{presented}} technology of bimetallic layered castings based on founding method of layer coating directly in cast process so-called method of mould cavity preparation. Prepared castings consist two fundamental parts i. e. bearing part and working part (layer). The bearing part of bimetallic layered casting is typical foundry material i. e. ferritic-pearlitic <b>unalloyed</b> cast <b>steel,</b> whereas working part (layer) is plate of austenitic alloy steel sort X 2 CrNi 18 - 9. The ratio of thickness between bearing and working part is 8 : 1. The aim of paper was assessed {{the quality of}} the joint between bearing and working part in dependence of pouring temperature and carbon concentration in cast steel. The quality of the joint in bimetallic layered castings was evaluated on the basis of ultrasonic non-destructive testing, structure and microhardness researches...|$|R
40|$|Developing the {{techniques}} of welding materials with higher dynamic strength onto the rolling surfaces of rails {{is one of the}} options for increasing their operational endurance. The subject of this paper is an analyses of heterogeneous weld interfaces experimentally manufactured by welding medium-carbon austenitic <b>steels</b> onto high-carbon <b>unalloyed</b> pearlitic <b>steels.</b> The analyses focus on examinations of the marginal mixing of the materials at the weld interface and the circumstances under which intercrystalline cracks form in the weld deposit layers. Structural analyses, chemical microanalyses and a hardness assessment were performed in order to identify the corresponding structural changes. The proportion of zonal vs. interdendritic segregation of the alloying elements in the degradation of the welded joint was distinguished. We described the nature of the structural heterogeneities produced, locally connected with the martensitic transformation. The chemical heterogeneity leading to the formation of martensite at grain boundaries was identified as the limiting effect. </p...|$|R
40|$|In paper {{a method}} of {{improvement}} in utility properties of <b>unalloyed</b> cast <b>steel</b> casting in result of diffusion of C and Cr in process of creation of surface layer is presented. The aim of paper was determination of diffusion range of basic elements of alloyed surface layer. Moreover a quantitative analysis of carbides phase strengthens alloyed surface layer of casting was carried out. The results of studies shown that important factors of surface layer creation are maximal temperature Tmax on granular insert – cast steel boundary dependent of pouring temperature, granularity Zw of Fe-Cr-C alloy insert and thickness of casting wall gśo. On the basis of obtained results was affirmed that with increase of thickness of casting wall increases range of diffusion in solid state in Fe-Cr-C grains and in liquid state. Moreover the range of Tmax = 13001500 oC favours creation of the proper alloyed surface layers on cast steel...|$|R
