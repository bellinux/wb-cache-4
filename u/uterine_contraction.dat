25|$|Prevention {{involves}} decreasing known {{risk factors}} including if possible procedures {{associated with the}} condition and giving the medication oxytocin to stimulate the uterus to contract shortly after the baby is born. Misoprostol may be used instead of oxytocin in resource poor settings. Treatments may include: intravenous fluids, blood transfusions, and the medication ergotamine to cause further <b>uterine</b> <b>contraction.</b> Efforts to compress the uterus using the hands may be effective if other treatments do not work. The aorta may also be compressed by pressing on the abdomen. The World Health Organization has recommended non-pneumatic anti-shock garment to help until other measures such as surgery can be carried out. In 2017 study found that tranexamic acid decreased a woman's risk of death.|$|E
25|$|Research on the catecholamines was {{interwoven}} {{with research}} on their receptors. In 1904, Dale became {{head of the}} Wellcome Physiological Research Laboratory in London and started research on ergot extracts. The relevance of his communication in 1906 ″On some physiological actions of ergot″ lies less in {{the effects of the}} extracts given alone than in their interaction with adrenaline: they reversed the normal pressor effect of adrenaline to a depressor effect and the normal contraction effect on the early-pregnant cat’s uterus to relaxation: adrenaline reversal. The pressor and <b>uterine</b> <b>contraction</b> effects of pituitary extracts, in contrast, remained unchanged, as did the effects of adrenaline on the heart and effects of parasympathetic nerve stimulation. Dale clearly saw the specificity of the ″paralytic″ (antagonist) effect of ergot for ″the so-called myoneural junctions connected with the true sympathetic or thoracic-lumbar division of the autonomic nervous system″ – the adrenoceptors. He also saw its specificity for the ″myoneural junctions″ mediating smooth muscle contraction as opposed to those mediating smooth muscle relaxation. But there he stopped. He did not conceive any close relationship between the smooth muscle-inhibitory and the cardiac sites of action of catecholamines.|$|E
2500|$|Following the birth, if {{the mother}} had an {{episiotomy}} or a tearing of the perineum, it is stitched. The midwife does regular assessments for <b>uterine</b> <b>contraction,</b> fundal height, and vaginal bleeding. [...] Throughout labor and delivery the mother's vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, and pulse) are closely monitored and her fluid intake and output are measured. The midwife also monitors the baby's pulse rate, palpates the mother's abdomen to monitor the baby's position, and does vaginal checks as needed. [...] If the birth deviates from the norm at any stage, the midwife requests assist from a more highly trained health care provider.|$|E

40|$|Both <b>uterine</b> <b>contractions</b> and {{artificial}} rupture of fetal membranes (amniotomy) are important events during delivery phase, {{this study was}} planned to determine possible effects of both events on fetal heart rate using nonstress test method. Sixty term pregnant women admitted for termination of pregnancy were selected. Primary nonstress test was performed, then nonstress test was done after active <b>uterine</b> <b>contractions.</b> After the amniotomy the last test was done. All results were statistically analyzed. Out of 60 term pregnant women, 51 (85 %) patients reported acceleration for primary nonstress test. After <b>uterine</b> <b>contractions,</b> acceleration was seen in 46 (76. 7 %) patients, this happened in 40 (66. 7 %) cases after amniotomy. There was no deceleration after primary nonstress test. However, deceleration reported after <b>uterine</b> <b>contractions</b> and amniotomy in five (8. 3 %) and two (3. 3 %) cases, respectively. The 56 (93. 3 %) patients showed variability in primary nonstress test; variability following the <b>uterine</b> <b>contractions</b> and amniotomy was seen in 58 (96. 7 %) and 56 (93. 3 %) of subjects, respectively. None of them were statistically significant (p> 0. 05). Mean fetal heart rate baseline in primary Nonstrees test was (141. 00 ± 9. 35), this was (140. 50 ± 10. 51) following <b>uterine</b> <b>contractions</b> and (143. 08 ± 11. 97) after amniotomy. Baseline fetal heart rate reduction, statistically significant, was seen following <b>uterine</b> <b>contractions</b> (r = + 0. 28, p = 0. 02). This means reductions in lower baseline fetal heart rates will be more outstanding. <b>Uterine</b> <b>contractions</b> and amniotomy had no correlation with {{presence or absence of}} variability, acceleration and deceleration...|$|R
