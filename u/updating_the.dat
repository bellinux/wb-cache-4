5|$|Bouyon (Boo-Yon) {{is a form}} {{of popular}} music of Dominica, also known as jump up music in Guadeloupe and Martinique. The best-known band in the genre is Windward Caribbean Kulture (WCK), who {{originated}} the style in 1988 by experimenting elements of kadans (or cadence-lypso), lapo kabwit drumming, the folk style jing-ping, and a quick-paced electronic drum pattern. From a language perspective, Bouyon draws on English and Dominican Creole French. More recently, deejays with raggamuffin-style vocals (bouyon-muffin) have moved to the fore, <b>updating</b> <b>the</b> sound for the New Generation.|$|E

5|$|As with zoneinfo, a user of Microsoft Windows configures DST by {{specifying the}} name of a location, and the {{operating}} system then consults a table of rule sets that must be updated when DST rules change. Procedures for specifying the name and <b>updating</b> <b>the</b> table vary with release. Updates are not issued for older versions of Microsoft Windows. Windows Vista supports at most two start and end rules per time zone setting. In a Canadian location observing DST, a single Vista setting supports both 1987–2006 and post-2006 time stamps, but mishandles some older time stamps. Older Microsoft Windows systems usually store only a single start and end rule for each zone, so that the same Canadian setting reliably supports only post-2006 time stamps.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis, the team {{intended}} to continue <b>updating</b> <b>the</b> game with post-release content, develop a port for the Xbox console, and create a sequel. Projected to take only nine months to develop, the Xbox version also known as , was released in 2005, {{four years after the}} game's initial release. The reason for the long development cycle stemmed from the team's unfamiliarity with the console's structure. With {{the release of}} a new generation of hardware including a new Xbox console, Elites release did not gain its audience's attention. Sales were lackluster and the development suffered a huge financial loss. In 2005 the company also founded the Independent Developers Association (IDEA) with Black Element Software and Altar Games. The organization aimed at supporting other independent game development studios with services including marketing support and negotiation with publishers.|$|E

5|$|Jellyvision Games did {{not want}} to change much of the older games for the 2011 version. They sought to keep as many of the old game {{question}} types, such as the Jack Attack and Dis Or Dat questions, <b>updating</b> <b>the</b> games to support online play. To counterbalance other types that would not be playable on consoles, such as Gibberish Questions that required players to type in a phrase, the developers added new features to the game, such as the Wrong Answer of the Game. The developers took advantage of other features of the newer consoles: they were able to use rumble features of console controllers to emphasize the effect of Screwing other players, and wrote several humorous titles for the in-game achievements.|$|E
5|$|Sir Arthur Elton (7th Bt) began <b>updating</b> <b>the</b> {{house before}} 1850 (and the lodge {{at the gate}} dates from 1851) {{but it was in}} 1860s that he made major changes. The west wing was {{extended}} and remodelled, this time with an Elizabethan style façade. Less obvious alterations to the east end (where the servants lived and worked) probably also date to this period. The fire of 1882 destroyed much of the western end of the house. In the rebuilding that followed, an even larger west end was constructed but Sir Arthur took pains to ensure that its Elizabethan south front was conserved and retained. Postcards of Clevedon reveal that the last change to the great hall window was made in about 1912, when it was given a square head again, in Elizabethan style.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1929, MSHD started <b>updating</b> <b>the</b> {{route that}} US23 {{followed}} through the Lower Peninsula. Late that year, the routing {{was moved to}} {{the east side of the}} Saginaw River, and M-47 was extended along the former course on the west side of the river. During 1930, a set of changes realigned the highway's route through the southeast corner of the state. Near Ida, US23 was rerouted along M-50 to Dundee and north through Milan to Ann Arbor, bypassing Maybee and Whittaker. US23 was moved from its inland routing between Omer and Tawas City via Whittemore to follow a shoreline alignment by way of Au Gres along Saginaw Bay around 1932; the former route through Twining and Whittemore became an extension of M-65 and the section from Whittemore east to Tawas City was added to M-55 as a part of these changes.|$|E

5|$|The NWOBHM {{involved}} both {{musicians and}} fans who were largely young, male {{and white and}} shared class origin, ethic and aesthetic values. American sociologist Deena Weinstein, in her book Heavy Metal: The Music and Its Culture, describes the rise and growth of the movement as the achievement of maturity for heavy metal, after its birth in the early 1970s and before branching out into various subgenres in the following years. British heavy metal fans, commonly known as muthas, metalheads or headbangers for the violent, rhythmic shaking of their heads {{in time to the}} music, dismissed the simplistic image of rebellious youth inherited from the counterculture of the 1960s and the psychedelic attachments characteristic of heavy rock in the 1970s, <b>updating</b> <b>the</b> shared principles and codes of the heavy metal subculture and definitely separating it from mainstream society.|$|E

5|$|Initial {{development}} {{began in}} November 2008 when Urban Squall met in San Diego for their annual meeting, 2008's theme was 'a {{game in a}} week'. The team consisted of designer and programmer Andrew Pellerano, programmer Panayoti Haritatos, graphic designer Tim Wendorf and musician Nick Esposito. The developers hired two adjoining hotel rooms and opened the connecting door, allowing them to concentrate solely on creating the game {{over a period of}} five days, resulting in a demo. Pellerano spent further weeks <b>updating</b> <b>the</b> game during his spare time after which it was released to the public. During the weeks between the initial demo version and the game's release, Wendorf playtested the game and provided feedback on the number of souls needed to allow special abilities to be activated. The music track was created one night when Pellerano met Esposito in the latter's studio, during which Pellerano also voiced the sound effects resulting from Cuties being killed.|$|E
5|$|Though Henry IV gave Thomas Percy {{influence}} in south Wales, {{relations between the}} two deteriorated due partly to delays in payment. Thomas’ nephew, Henry Percy, rose in armed rebellion in July 1403 and Thomas joined him. The rebellion culminated in the battle of Shrewsbury in which Thomas Percy was captured. Two days later, on 23 July, he was beheaded and his property– including Wressle Castle– was subsequently confiscated by the crown. Between 1403 and 1471 ownership of the castle swapped between the crown and those the reigning monarch chose to grant it to, though only for short periods. In 1471, Wressle Castle was given to Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland, returning it to the Percy family. His son, Henry Algernon Percy, 5th Earl of Northumberland, undertook an extensive programme of refurbishment at Wressle Castle, refurbishing the interior and <b>updating</b> <b>the</b> gardens. At the time {{he was one of the}} richest men in England. The Northumberland Household Book was compiled around this time and details day-to-day domestic activities at the castles of Wressle and Leconfield, and is used by historians to study the late medieval household.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Staff College, Camberley, Dannatt {{took the}} Higher Command and Staff Course (HCSC), {{after which he}} was {{promoted}} to colonel on 31 December 1991, backdated to 30 June 1991, and tasked with the running of the HCSC, as well as <b>updating</b> <b>the</b> British Military Doctrine {{in the light of the}} end of the Cold War. He also drafted the campaign plan for Lieutenant General (later General Sir) Mike Rose's command of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in the Balkans. Dannatt was promoted to brigadier on 31 December 1993, backdated to 30 June 1993, and took command of 4th Armoured Brigade, based in Germany. He spent 1994 commanding the brigade and overseeing training and, in 1995, was posted to Bosnia along with his headquarters staff, leaving the rest of the brigade in Germany and taking command of separate units already deployed in Bosnia. He commanded UNPROFOR's Sector South West, composed of troops from multiple nations, while also serving as Commander of British Forces (COMBRITFOR), responsible for overseeing operations of all British troops in Bosnia. After the signing of the Dayton Agreement in November 1995, UNPROFOR became the NATO-led Implementation Force and Dannatt's brigade was incorporated into a multi-national division commanded by Mike Jackson. Dannatt was later appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for his service in the Balkans. Handing over 4th Armoured Brigade to David Richards, Dannatt was appointed Director, Defence Programme Staff at the MoD in 1996 and was responsible for part of the implementation of the Strategic Defence Review, produced by the Labour government that had come to power in 1997.|$|E
