40|$|India is {{the second}} largest {{producer}} of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) in the world, producing 7. 8 million t in 2001 – 02 (CMIE 2004). Sorghum in India is grown in the rainy season (June–October) on around 4. 5 million ha and in the postrainy season (September–January) on around 5. 4 million ha. In the state of Andhra Pradesh, rainy season sorghum is grown on 0. 3 million ha, producing 0. 29 million t of grain while the postrainy season sorghum accounts for 0. 34 million ha producing 0. 35 million t of grain (Government of Andhra Pradesh 2003). Generally, resource-poor small farmers in the semi-arid regions of Andhra Pradesh with less than 1 ha of land grow sorghum. The crop is mainly cultivated under semisubsistence farming to meet household requirements of food and fodder with a small marketable surplus.

A significant portion of pearl millet grain is also <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>non-food</b> <b>purposes</b> such as poultry and cattle feed and alcohol extraction. Pearl millet improvement research in India is coordinated through the All India Coordinated Pearl Millet Improvement Project (AICPMIP) under the aegis of Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). Enormous accomplishments have been made in pearl millet improvement during the last 25 years. This chapter presents an overview of achievements in genetic improvement, cultural practices, disease and insect-pest management, seed production and value addition. Germplasm from diverse genetic backgrounds and breeding materials with adequate disease resistance have been utilized in hybrid parental line breeding programmes leading towards development of hybrids with good adaptation to diverse production environments. During the last 25 years, a total of 115 improved cultivars were released, which provided a wider cultivar choice to farmers in various agro-ecological regions. Agronomic research led to the establishment of detailed recommendations for agroecology specific pearl millet zones which made it possible to harness the yield potential of high-yielding hybrids and varieties. High-yielding hybrids and open-pollinated varieties (OPVs) have been widely adopted by Indian farmers. Currently, nearly 65 % of pearl millet area is under improved cultivars, mainly hybrids. A genetic linkage map of pearl millet has been developed, and quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been identified for traits of economic importance to facilitate molecular marker-assisted selection. Several processing technologies have been standardized to popularize pearl millet-based traditional and health food products. In the future climate change scenario, pearl millet being a highly climate resilient crop will play a greater role in providing food and nutritional security...|$|R

The life-cylce wide impacts of the <b>use</b> of biomass <b>for</b> energy and material purposes derived from either direct crop harvest or residuals indicate that biomass based substitutes have a different, not always superior environmental performance than comparable fossil based products. Cascading use, i. e. when biomass is <b>used</b> <b>for</b> material products first and the energy content is recovered from the end-of-life products, tends to provide a higher environmental benefit than primary use as fuel. Due to limited global land resources, non-food biomass may only substitute for a certain share of non-renewables. If the demand <b>for</b> <b>non-food</b> biomass, especially fuel crops and its derivates, continues to grow this will inevitably lead to an expansion of global arable land {{at the expense of}} natural ecosystems such as savannas and tropical rain forests. Whereas the current aspirations and incentives to increase the use of non-food biomass are intended to counteract climate change and environmental degradation, they are thus bound to a high risk of problem shifting and may even lead to a global deterioration of the environment. Although the "balanced approach" of the European Union's biomass strategy may be deemed a good principle, the concrete targets and implementation measures in the Union and countries like Germany should be revisited.

We assess the bio-physical and economic production potentials of energy crops and explore the trade-offs between bioenergy and food production on arable lands in Austria. In a policy experiment, we analyze how costly it is to expand domestic non-food biomass production by employing an integrated modeling framework using an elaborated set of bio-physical and economic data. The results indicate that an expansion of biomass production for first and second generation biofuels would imply significant adjustment costs for the agricultural sector. Furthermore, increasing feedstock production would have significant impacts on land use and fertilizer intensity levels. The economic analysis considers differences of regions and site conditions, which lead to higher opportunity costs, and hence, higher feedstock costs as assumed in previous studies.

40|$|The Netherlands {{has been}} {{cultivating}} sugar beet in large agro-industrial co-operatives since the 19 th century. In recent years, the sugar quota has limited sugar beet cultivation but the quota will expire in 2017. At the same time, the Dutch government aims {{to stimulate the}} biobased economy, therefore increasing the demand for biomass. For example, the proposed biorefinery project REDIFINERY is expected to consume four million tonnes of feedstock per year. Several studies indicate that, {{with the increase in}} demand, large amounts of biomass are imported to The Netherlands, while locally cultivated biomass shows economic potential at world market prices. Therefore, in this research, the geographic potential of locally cultivated sugar beet as a biomass resource <b>for</b> <b>non-food</b> <b>purposes</b> in the south west of The Netherlands is determined up to 2030. This is achieved by using ArcGIS software, creating maps of the sugar beet yields and costs. These cover the whole research area of the south west of The Netherlands, and, then in more detail, the province of South Holland. Scenarios from PBL/CPB (WLO scenarios) are used to determine agricultural land availability <b>for</b> <b>non-food</b> <b>purposes,</b> and KWIN AGV data is used to determine the cost of cultivation. To determine the transport costs, a demand node is assumed on the Maasvlakte. Other important inputs in to the model are; soil type, experience with sugar beet cultivation and transport distance. To determine the potential, the findings are benchmarked against imported lignocellulosic biomass sources. The supply costs found are extrapolated until 2030 to determine the future of sugar beet as a biomass source and as a stepping stone for the Dutch biobased economy. Finally, the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the locally grown sugar beets are compared to imported biomass. In the south west of The Netherlands, the theoretical potential is estimated to be 198. 8 PJ (52 Mt sugar beet, 8, 946 kt fermentable sugar). The technical potential, limited by the crop rotations and WLO scenarios, is estimated to be 1. 9 PJ (0. 490 Mt sugar beet, 84 kt fermentable sugar). The economic potential, limited by the technical potential, is estimated to be 1. 9 PJ (0. 490 Mt sugar beet, 84 kt fermentable sugar). If the province of South Holland is examined in detail, the theoretical potential is estimated to be 39. 2 PJ (10. 3 Mt sugar beet, 1. 76 Mt fermentable sugar); the technical potential, limited by crop rotations and land availability without harming the food and feed supply, is estimated to be 0. 4 PJ (0. 094 Mt sugar beet, 16 kt fermentable sugar). The economic potential, again limited by the technical potential, is estimated to be 0. 4 PJ (0. 094 Mt sugar beet, 16 kt fermentable sugar). The net present value (NPV) of the business as usual (BAU) and bio economy crop rotations are compared in South Holland and they show that the NPV would increase when sugar beet is increased in the rotation. The data, with the addition of lower and higher limits, is shown in table 1. The 0. 49 Mt of sugar beet cultivated <b>for</b> <b>non-food</b> <b>purposes</b> in the south west of The Netherlands makes a large contribution to the 1. 6 Mt currently cultivated. The 0. 094 Mt of sugar beet cultivated <b>for</b> <b>non-food</b> <b>purposes</b> in the province of South Holland also substantially contributes to the 0. 3 Mt currently cultivated. However, when the potentials found in the south west of The Netherlands are compared to the demand, which is set to rise, by the REDIFINIERY project for example, it will only be a small contribution.   Table 1 Theoretical, Technical and Economic potential of sugar beet cultivation found in this thesis 		Reference case	Lower limit 	Higher limit 	Area	PJ (total yield 1) 	PJ (total yield) 	PJ (total yield 1) Theoretical Potential	SW-N 3 	 198. 8 (52 - 8, 946) 	N.

The results show that Dutch sugar beet cultivation costs are projected to remain below global market prices for raw sugars, fermentable sugars derived from woodchips, and fermentable sugars derived from wood pellets until 2030. Lastly, the GHG emissions of ethanol from sugar beet are compared to those of woodchips, assuming that ethanol will be produced. The GHG emissions of sugar beet ethanol range from 38 to 40 g CO 2 -eq/MJ ethanol and a GHG-saving performance of between 52 % and 53 %. This is insufficient to meet the EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED) (2009 / 28 /EC) threshold for liquid biofuel installations installed after 2018 (60 %). Sugar beet cultivation in the south west of The Netherlands can compete economically until 2030 in the world biomass market. It has a total potential of 0. 49 Mt of sugar beet cultivated at or below world market prices. This increases even further if technical constraints on competition with the food supply are not taken into account...|$|R
40|$|The {{last decade}} {{has seen a}} surging demand for {{biofuels}} {{in the wake of}} increasing oil prices and rising environmental concerns. The most common biofuel is bio-ethanol accounting for more than 90 % of total biofuel usage. It is increasingly produced from sugar cane making cane a strategic crop for biofuels. Given the growing demand for "green" fuels, bio-ethanol production has been supported by energy policies in the past decade, which have consequently been accused of contributing to the global trend of rising food prices and thus jeopardising food security. However, while biofuel policies are an important driver, prices as much as food security will ultimately be determined by supply constraints of strategic crops. This paper hence investigates drivers of and constraints to sugar cane production in (the) People's Republic of China and India and shows that supply side constraints vary significantly in the two countries. (the) PRC and India both face serious limitations with regard to suitable available land for the further expansion of sugar cane production.

To meet the objectives and the sustainability of agri-chains, research into genetic improvement must propose new approaches, new tools, and innovative breeding methods. The objectives, and sometimes the entire breeding process, are shared with all the actors, especially the end users, as part of an enhanced partnership within agri-chains. The breeding strategy also depends on ease of access, better use of available and useful genetic resources, in-depth knowledge of the structure and diversity of these resources, genetic determinism of desirable traits, and pre-breeding approaches.

We have similarly shown that legumes have a key role in soilC sequestration and that the inclusion of legumes as sole crops, cover crops or intercrops usually enhances the rate of soil C accumulation even within relative short time periods. Legumes are not likely, in the short-term, to be used as monoculture crops for biorefinery feedstock, due to their relatively low DM yield.

Out of a screening with 700 tested decamer primers (operon primers) seven gave polymorphisms between the high and low linolenic bulks. At least the RAPD marker OP G 18 _ 6 _ 9 _ 0 could be mapped in a distance of 28. 3 cM to the Ln_x gene. As this distance is to large <b>for</b> practical <b>use</b> the AFLP and RFLP methods should be alternatively applied in future investigations. The use of microsatellite primers gave special amplification products. But the obtained fragments did not show linkage to the gene(s) responsible for linolenic acid content. (orig.)

40|$|Introduction. Dairy {{industry}} {{generates a}} large amount of wastewaters that have high concentrations and contain milk components. Membrane processes {{have been shown to be}} convenient for wastewater treatment recovering milk components present in wastewaters and producing treated water. Materials and methods. The experiments were carried out in an unstirred batch sell using nanofiltration membranes OPMN-P (ZAO STC “Vladipor”, Russian Federation) and reverse osmosis membranes NanoRo, ZAO (“RM Nanotech”, Russian Federation). The model solutions of dairy effluents –diluted skim and whole milk were used. Results. The nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membranes showed the same permeate flux during the concentration of model solutions of dairy effluents. The reason of this was likely membrane fouling with feed components. The fouling indexes indicated the fouling factor that was higher for RO. The higher permeate quality was obtainedwith RO membranes. The NF permeate containing up to 0. 4 g/L of lactose and 0. 75 g/L of mineral salts can be discharged or after finishing trеatment (e. g. RO or other) can be reused. The obtained NF and RO retentate corresponds to milk in composition and can be <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>non-food</b> applications or as feed supplement for animals. Conclusions. The studied RO and NF membranes can be <b>used</b> <b>for</b> concentration of dairy effluents at low pressure. They showed better performance and separation characteristics comparing with data of other membranes available in the literature...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Concern {{over land}} <b>use</b> <b>for</b> <b>non-food</b> {{bioenergy}} crops requires breeding programmes {{that focus on}} producing biomass on the minimum amount of land that is economically-viable. To achieve this, the maximum potential yield per hectare is a key target for improvement. For long lived tree species, such as poplar, this requires {{an understanding of the}} traits that contribute to biomass production and their genetic control. An important aspect of this for long lived plants is an understanding of genetic interactions at different developmental stages, i. e. how genes or genetic regions impact on yield over time. Results QTL mapping identified regions of genetic control for biomass yield. We mapped consistent QTL across multiple coppice cycles and identified five robust QTL hotspots on linkage groups III, IV, X, XIV and XIX, calling these 'Poplar Biomass Loci' (PBL 1 – 5). In total 20 % of the variation in final harvest biomass yield was explained by mapped QTL. We also investigated the genetic correlations between yield related traits to identify 'early diagnostic' indicators of yield showing that early biomass was a reasonable predictor of coppice yield and that leaf size, cell number and stem and sylleptic branch number were also valuable traits. Conclusion These findings provide insight into the genetic control of biomass production and correlation to 'early diagnostic' traits determining yield in poplar SRC for bioenergy. QTL hotspots serve as useful targets for directed breeding for improved biomass productivity that may also be relevant across additional poplar hybrids. </p...|$|R

In this form, it is also used in plumbing, electrical cable insulation, imitation leather, signage, phonograph records, inflatable products, and many applications where it replaces rubber.|$|R
40|$|Domestic livestock, such as {{farm animals}} and pets, {{are part of}} the {{cultural}} heritage of mankind. Animals have been <b>used</b> <b>for</b> food, services, <b>non-food</b> or religious <b>purposes</b> or just as a hobby for thousands of years. Man-made breeding has created livestock that are adapted for different purposes and functions. Today, thousand of breeds exist: adapted to the various conditions in human households. The discussion of animal welfare and the definition of standards for livestock keeping have to consider the different functions, ethical values and perceptions of people involved (Badura, 1999). The differences of culture, as well as private and common wealth between individuals, regions and countries, can be a reason for different standards for animal keeping. This discussion can become easier with an understanding of the functions of animals from a historical and ethical perspective. This can help to answer the question of how the animals should be kept...|$|R
40|$|Alternative and {{renewable}} {{sources of energy}} have received much attention {{and there are a number}} of approaches: wind, hydro, solar nuclear and the use of biomass. Here discussion will focus on the use of biomass, however there are a number of alternative methods in applying this as a source of “energy”. For example incineration (to generate heat and electricity), production of biodiesel and biomass to liquids (BTL) by chemical and thermal based processes respectively and the production of bioethanol and biogas using biotechnology. However the <b>use</b> of biomass <b>for</b> <b>non-food</b> applications raises a number of important issues which need to be considered for any conversion process such as: food production and price increases, destruction of the rainforest and greenhouse gases. Strategies which circumvent these should be explored and one potential route is the use of waste lignocellulose biomass (derived from primary agricultural practice) and its application for energy and fuels...|$|R
