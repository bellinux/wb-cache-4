500|$|The Corporate Vice-President of Microsoft's Interactive Entertainment Business division, Peter Moore, {{announced}} at E3 2006 {{that the game}} would appear on Xbox 360, by rolling <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>sleeve</b> to reveal a Grand Theft Auto IV temporary tattoo. Rockstar Games initially appeared {{to be committed to}} the original 16 October 2007 release date; however, Wedbush Morgan analyst Michael Pachter suggested that Take-Two may choose to delay the release of the game in order to boost its financial results for 2008 and to avoid competing with the release of other highly anticipated titles, such as Halo 3. Rockstar responded by saying that Grand Theft Auto IV was still on track for release in [...] "late October". On 2 August 2007, Take-Two announced that Grand Theft Auto IV would miss its original release date of 16 October 2007 contrary to their previous statements, and would be delayed to their second fiscal quarter (February–April) of 2008. In a later conference call with investors, Take-Two's Strauss Zelnick attributed the delay to [...] "almost strictly technological problems ... not problems, but challenges." [...] It was later revealed that technical difficulties with the PlayStation 3 version of the game contributed to the delay, along with storage problems on the Xbox 360. On 24 January 2008, Take-Two announced that Grand Theft Auto IV would be released on 29 April 2008. As the release date approached, Rockstar Games and Take-Two marketed the game heavily through various forms, including television ads, Internet video, billboards, viral marketing, and a redesigned website. A special edition of the game was also released for both the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. At a Take-Two shareholder meeting on 18 April 2008, Take-Two CEO Ben Feder announced that Grand Theft Auto IV had already [...] "gone gold" [...] and was [...] "in production and in trucks en route to retailers". The game was eventually released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 video game consoles in Europe, North America, and Oceania on 29 April 2008, and in Japan on 30 October 2008. Overall, Grand Theft Auto IV took over 1000 people and more than {{three and a half years}} to complete, with a total cost estimated at approximately $100 million, making it, at the time, the most expensive video game ever developed.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2012, {{before the}} start of the English season, Worcestershire's {{director}} of cricket Steve Rhodes commented that Ali's doosra was [...] "not too difficult to pick at the moment but he's learning a few tricks and he's got other things <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>sleeve.</b> It's a work in progress".|$|E
2500|$|Grandmaster Larry Evans {{wrote that}} Adams' [...] "tournament results were damaged by his dogmatism. Playing under the self-inflicted {{handicap}} of arming his opponents with advance {{knowledge of his}} 'best' lines, he felt honor-bound to steer straight into them even though his adversary invariably had a cook <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>sleeve.</b> By the time Weaver found a refutation and published it, another player found a different cook and so on ad infinitum." [...] According to Chess Review, this phenomenon may explain Adams' poor result at Hastings 1950–51.|$|E

2500|$|The {{narrative}} of the poem focuses on a Chinese immigrant character named Ah Sin who is playing the card game euchre with two white men on August 3 of an unspecified year. [...] "Truthful James", {{one of the men}} who narrates the poem, observes that the other white man, Bill Nye, is cheating with a stacked deck and cards <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>sleeve.</b> They both seemed to think Ah Sin was childlike and did not understand the game. Nevertheless, Ah Sin plays well and soon puts down the same card that Nye had dealt to the narrator. Thinking their opponent is cheating, Nye fights Ah Sin and discovers he has several decks hidden in his clothes.|$|E
2500|$|Guitarist DJ Ashba {{has said}} that the next album is being discussed, stating that the band [...] "has been {{throwing}} around a bunch of ideas" [...] and joked that the next album [...] "won't take as long" [...] to release. On April 20, 2011, Ashba said in an interview at the Revolver Golden Gods Awards that Guns N' Roses have been [...] "working on new songs every day". In an interview with reporter Nui Te Koha on Triple M Melbourne's The Hot Breakfast, Ashba talked about songs Rose has written, stating: [...] "Axl has a lot of great songs <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>sleeve.</b> He probably has three albums worth of stuff recorded. The stuff I've heard... I've been up in his hotel room many nights and he just sits down at the piano and plays. I'm like 'this is amazing, people have to hear this song' and he's like [...] "ah, this is something I'm tinkering on'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Griffith, however, had an ace <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>sleeve</b> {{that the}} republican faction never succeeded in neutralising: the SFPP was a limited {{liability}} company. This prevented any infiltration by the IRB and guaranteed the absolute independence {{of the board of}} directors. With both the name of the company and of its publications registered with the Customs House in Dublin, Griffith and his colleagues effectively owned the name “Sinn Féin” and their newspaper would be perceived as the official organ of the movement no matter how much the republican faction might protest. In 1910, P. S. O'Hegarty and some of his London republican allies attempted to dissociate the newspaper from the party. Although he praised the Sinn Féin Daily, and even called it the [...] "best daily newspaper in Ireland", he was disappointed by what he perceived as the bowdlerisation of the Sinn Féin message. Both O'Hegarty and Hobson attacked him in the Irish Nation and Peasant which had replaced The Republic. With the aim of preventing any such incidents in the future, O' Hegarty proposed the following resolution at the annual Sinn Féin convention of 1910: ...|$|E

60|$|So {{swiftly and}} effectually was the deed done, that the jaguar next moment hung limp and dead in our hero's grasp. Dropping {{it on the}} ground, he turned <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>sleeves</b> to examine the wounds.|$|R
6000|$|... "Time {{enough to}} chaff after work is over," [...] cried Ruby with a laugh, {{as he turned}} <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>sleeves,</b> and, seizing the hammer, began, as his friend Dove said, [...] "to work himself dry." ...|$|R
60|$|But Phonograph Davis, his {{appetite}} for fun not yet appeased, had something more <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>sleeve.</b>|$|E
60|$|He pulled <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>sleeve</b> {{and showed}} his wrist. There {{in the flesh}} were the {{indentations}} {{of a set of}} teeth.|$|E
60|$|It now became {{plain that}} he had {{something}} <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>sleeve.</b> We expressed a unanimous desire {{to know what it}} was.|$|E
6000|$|Silence was restored, and {{all stood}} around in {{expectant}} attitudes {{to hear the}} Squire's explanation. He squared <b>his</b> elbows, shoved <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>sleeves,</b> puffed out <b>his</b> fat cheeks, moistened his lips, and began pompously: [...] "Gentlemen"---- ...|$|R

60|$|Mr. Martin {{expressed}} the same opinion in rather stronger terms; Mr. Simpson, after having let {{a variety of}} expletive adjectives loose upon society without any substantive to accompany them, tucked <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>sleeves,</b> and began to wash the greens for dinner.|$|R

60|$|This knife was {{concealed}} <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>sleeve,</b> {{and then}} the soldier waited for his chance to use the blade, which was as sharp as a razor.|$|E
6000|$|... "Na, na, lads," [...] cried John Watt, rolling <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>sleeves,</b> and baring <b>his</b> brawny arms as if {{about to}} engage in a fight, [...] "it'll niver do to {{interfere}} wi' the law; but what d'ye say to gie them anither dook?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, nothin' p'tic'lar," [...] {{answered}} Ans, flinging his hat at {{a chicken}} that made {{as though to}} come in, and rolling <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>sleeves</b> preparatory to sozzling his face at the sink. [...] "I jest cuffed 'em a little, an' let 'em go." ...|$|R
60|$|So saying, he {{put down}} his cane, took off his hat, his coat, his waistcoat, his collar, and his cravat and his cuffs; he rolled <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>sleeves,</b> he turned <b>up</b> the bottoms of his trousers, and then taking an axe, he set to work.|$|R
60|$|Now at {{this the}} Fakeer {{was so much}} incensed that his hand trembled; and, lo! {{in the midst of}} a miracle the cards fell from <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>sleeve.</b>|$|E

60|$|And rolling <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>sleeves,</b> Roger {{took the}} {{staff in the}} middle with both hands, {{in the manner of}} a quarterstaff, and made it play round his head; with a speed, and vigour, that showed that he was a {{complete}} master of the exercise.|$|R
6000|$|... "My blessin's on de sweet ladies {{what takes}} {{so much trouble}} for us," [...] said Zulu, pulling <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>sleeves</b> and {{regarding}} with much satisfaction a pair of worsted cuffs; [...] "nebber had no sore wrists since I put on dese.

60|$|No {{sooner had}} {{he made this}} proud boast than he went white, and soon two disgraceful tears rolled down his cheeks. The boys saw that for some reason unknown his courage was gone, and even Francie Crabb began to turn <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>sleeves</b> and spit upon his hands.|$|R
60|$|And {{he grinned}} <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>sleeve</b> at this girl-teacher, {{sometimes}} hanging round her to fawn on her. But this made her dislike him more. He {{had a kind}} of leech-like power.|$|E
6000|$|... "Rover's got a card <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>sleeve,</b> that's {{as sure as}} you're born," [...] {{said one}} of the students, and winked at Tom. But Tom only looked wise and turned away.|$|E
60|$|He {{then pulled}} <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>sleeve</b> {{and showed them}} his arm, which was shrunken, it is true, but which had been so, as they all very well knew, from the hour of his birth.|$|E
5000|$|Anderson would {{occasionally}} {{appear on the}} Boston Pops regular concerts on PBS to conduct his own music while Fiedler {{would sit on the}} sidelines.
