25|$|In Hinduism, Sangam {{literature}} <b>uses</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> pedi {{to refer}} to people born with an intersex condition; it also refers to antharlinga hijras and various other hijras.

50|$|The choice not to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> 'preventive' in <b>the</b> 2002 National Security Strategy, {{and instead}} <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> 'preemptive' was largely in {{anticipation}} of the widely perceived illegality of preventive attacks in international law, via both Charter Law and Customary Law.|$|R
25|$|The New Testament {{follows the}} {{terminology}} of the Septuagint, and thus <b>uses</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> psyche with the Hebrew semantic domain {{and not the}} Greek, that is an invisible power (or ever more, for Platonists, immortal and immaterial) that gives life and motion to the body and is responsible for its attributes.|$|E
25|$|According to the Priestly Code of the Book of Numbers, killing {{anyone outside}} {{the context of}} war with a weapon, or in unarmed combat, is {{considered}} retzach, but if the killing is accidental, the accused must not leave the city, or he will be considered guilty of intentional murder. The Bible never <b>uses</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> retzach in conjunction with war.|$|E
25|$|The Qur'an {{has also}} pointed out that believers perform Salaah only to earn the {{pleasure}} of Allah and not to impress anyone else, calling anyone who does so a hypocrite. Moreover, those who abandon Salaah are warned of dire consequences, while only those who humbly submit themselves to Allah alone are said to have ease in offering it. In Surah Al-Ma'arij, Allah <b>uses</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> halu’an to describe the restless and impatient nature of man, stating that whenever he is afflicted with trouble he lacks patience and trembles in despair. This occurs due to shortcomings in his faith, whereas when he is given in abundance he becomes ungrateful towards Allah. He is also arrogant and uncaring towards those less fortunate than him. The Qur'an then assures the observance of Salaah as way to preserve hope in times of grievance and humbleness as well as humility in periods of bountiful life. Salaah thus has the power to erase the roots of evil deeds which bring barriers in the society giving birth to racial as well as financial discriminations and sinful intentions.|$|E

500|$|Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716) was {{a student}} of Erhard Weigel (1625–1699) and learned of the conatus {{principle}} from him and from Hobbes, though Weigel used the word tendentia (Latin: tendency). Specifically, Leibniz <b>uses</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> conatus in his Exposition and Defence of the New System (1695) to describe a notion similar that of Hobbes, but he differentiates between the conatus {{of the body and}} soul, the first of which may only travel in a straight line by its own power, and the latter of which may [...] "remember" [...] more complicated motions.|$|E
500|$|Although LGBT activists {{acknowledged}} the noble intentions behind the episode, the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation objected to [...] "The F Word", stating the episode still <b>uses</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> {{in a very}} derogatory context, {{even though it is}} directed against bikers instead of homosexuals. As a result, GLAAD said [...] "The F Word" [...] still reinforced the usage of the word [...] "fag" [...] as a means of insulting others, and could be unintentionally harmful to the gay community. GLAAD officials called it a [...] "slur-filled episode" [...] and demanded an apology from South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Comedy Central declined to respond to the comments.|$|E

500|$|AA {{describes}} alcoholism as {{an illness}} that involves a physical allergy (where [...] "allergy" [...] {{has a different}} meaning than that used in modern medicine.) and a mental obsession.

500|$|... "Dame" [...] is an uptempo [...] "R-lite" [...] {{track with}} [...] "underlying hip-hop rhythms".
