25|$|High-quality {{compound}} fertilizers containing nitrogen co-granulated {{with other}} components such as phosphates {{have been produced}} routinely since {{the beginnings of the}} modern fertilizer industry, but on account of the low melting point and hygroscopic nature of urea it took courage to apply the same kind of technology to granulate urea on its own. But {{at the end of the}} 1970s three companies began to develop fluidized-bed granulation. The first in the field was Nederlandse Stikstof Maatschappij, which later became part of Hydro Agri (now Yara International). Yara eventually sold this technology to Uhde GmbH, whose Uhde Fertilizer Technology (UFT) subsidiary now markets it. Around the same time Toyo Engineering Corporation developed its spouted-bed process, comprising a fluidized bed deliberately agitated to produce turbulent ebullation. Stamicarbon also undertook development work on its own fluidized-bed granulation system, using film sprays rather than atomizing sprays to introduce the <b>urea</b> <b>melt,</b> but shelved it until the 1990s, when there was for a time considerable doubt about the commercial future of the Hydro (UFT) process. As a result, the Stamicarbon technology is now commercialized and highly successful. More recently, Urea Casale introduced a different fluidized-bed granulation system: the urea is sprayed in laterally from the side walls of the granulator instead of from the bottom. This organizes the bed into two cylindrical masses contrarotating on parallel longitudinal axes. The raw product is uniform enough to not require screens.|$|E
50|$|Until the 1970s most urea plants {{produced}} their fertilizer in {{the form}} of prills. In the prilling process, droplets of urea ‘melt’ (obtained by concentrating the product solution from the urea plant to a very high level) are cast into an upward flow of air, solidifying as they fall. For air prilling, a concrete tower is required between 40 and 70 meters high, depending on the production capacity and climatic conditions. On account of their relatively low strength, prills are susceptible to breakage during handling and transportation, which increases the risk of caking (concretion) of the product during storage and gives rise to dust when the urea is spread on the land.Stamicarbon developed a new technology to improve the impact strength, known as ‘seeding’. This process involves blowing tiny urea particles (seeds) into the prilling tower. The seeds act as kernels for the crystallization of the <b>urea</b> <b>melt</b> droplets, and in so doing their strength is increased.|$|E

Small aggregates and single particles are in crystalline form, but smaller than the conventional impregnated method, and with some potential porosity in the particle. The EDX studies of 3  nm probes gave a Co to O atomic ratio of 58 – 42  %, suggesting that some cobalt might be reduced by the urea during the calcinations.|$|R

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is used to investigate the flow field of <b>urea</b> <b>melt</b> inside the perforated rotating bucket. The bucket is mounted {{at the top of}} the prilling tower. In prilling process, <b>urea</b> <b>melt</b> is sprayed by the perforated rotating bucket to produce the urea droplets, which falls down due to gravity. These drops fall down through a cooling medium and solidify into prills. The velocity field in the bucket is very important to study, as it has great effect on the heat and mass transfer performance in prilling process. ANSYS 14. 0 CFD package is used to simulate and Design Modeler and Catia V 5 are used for geometrical model of the perforated prilling bucket. Velocity distribution on different planes are obtained and discussed...|$|E

Given that much more excessive urea is added in the catalyst preparation, there maybe some amount of carbon residue in the catalyst, which may be removed by TPO–TPR treatment, {{it has also been}} shown that the TPO–TPR cycle treatment of the cobalt catalyst can increase the catalyst dispersion [36, 37, 38]. And for the cobalt catalyst prepared using <b>urea</b> <b>melt</b> cobalt salt method, the optimization of the catalyst activation may be able to improve the catalyst performance. To reach a better catalyst performance, therefore in the following work, we will employ TPR–TPO treatment of the Co/SiO 2 –ZrO 2 –urea and to characterize the catalyst Co dispersion and H 2 pickup so as to explore the optimized conditions for the catalyst activation.|$|E

Thus this work describes the preparation and application of new urea condensates formed from the reaction of urea {{with a variety of}} chemicals including phosphoric acid, phosphorous acid and sulphamic acid; the condensates gave different degrees of flame retardancy (FR) on a variety of substrates. Studies of urea thermal decomposition showed the production of isocyanic acid and ammonia, above "the <b>urea</b> <b>melting</b> point (l 3 S•C). Using an open reaction vessel, urea, sulphamic acid and phosphorous acid gave an exothermic reaction over the temperature range 120 - 140 'C with gas liberation. The condensates thus formed contained aliphatic polyamide chains, containing urea groups and sulphur and phosphorus residues. According to the type and amount of initial materials, various urea condensates, capable of imparting different degrees of flame retardancy, were synthesized. The sulphamic acid/urea (SIU), phosphoric acid /urea (P AIU), sulphamic acid/phosphoric acid/urea (SJPAIU) and also sulphamic acid/phosphorous acid/urea (S/PH/U) condensates were produced.

40|$|Maltose binding protein (MBP) is a large, monomeric two domain protein {{containing}} 370 amino acids. In {{the absence}} of denaturant at neutral pH, the protein is in the native state, while at pH 3. 0 it forms a molten globule. The molten globule lacks a tertiary circular dichroism signal but has secondary structure {{similar to that of}} the native state. The molten globule binds 8 -anilino- 1 -naphthalene sulfonate (ANS). The unfolding thermodynamics of MBP at both pHs were measured by carrying out a series of isothermal <b>urea</b> <b>melts</b> at temperatures ranging from 274 – 329 K. At 298 K, values of [Delta]G°, [Delta]Cp, and Cm were 3. 1 ± 0. 2 kcal mol− 1, 5. 9 ± 0. 8 kcal mol− 1 K− 1 (15. 9 cal (mol-residue) − 1 K− 1), and 0. 8 M, respectively, at pH 3. 0 and 14. 5 ± 0. 4 kcal mol− 1, 8. 3 ± 0. 7 kcal mol− 1 K− 1 (22. 4 kcal (mol-residue) − 1 K− 1), and 3. 3 M, respectively, at pH 7. 1. Guanidine hydrochloride denaturation at pH 7. 1 gave values of [Delta]G° and [Delta]Cp similar to those obtained with urea. The m values for denaturation are strongly temperature dependent, in contrast to what has been previously observed for small globular proteins. The value of [Delta]Cp per mol-residue for the molten globule is comparable to corresponding values of [Delta]Cp for the unfolding of typical globular proteins and suggests that it is a highly ordered structure, unlike molten globules of many small proteins. The value of [Delta]Cp per mol-residue for the unfolding of the native state is among the highest currently known for any protein...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{evidence for}} the extremely high resistance of a complex of crayfish trypsin (CFT) and bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) against heating and chemical denaturing agents such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and urea. To dissociate this complex 15 minute boiling in SDS was necessary as compared to a complex of bovine trypsin and BPTI that dissociates in SDS without boiling. The CFT-BPTI complex remained stable even in 9 M urea, while the bovine trypsin-BPTI complex started to dissociate at about 4 M <b>urea.</b> The <b>melting</b> temperature of the bovine trypsin-BPTI and CFT-BPTI complexes, as determined by differential scanning calorimetry, {{were found to be}} 79. 6 and 100. 1 oC, respectively. The behaviour of the apo-enzymes did not provide a definite clue to the differential effects of BPTI on their stabilities, although CFT was found to have a less stable structure as compared to that of bovine trypsin and in the X-ray structure of the CFT-BPTI complex we identified a few extra binding sites for BPTI. Though the structural cause of the extreme stability of the CFT-BPTI complex is not yet fully understood, our study could be a starting point to develop new protein complexes with enhanced stability...|$|R

The sulphamic acid/urea (SIU), phosphoric acid /urea (P AIU), sulphamic acid/phosphoric acid/urea (SJPAIU) and also sulphamic acid/phosphorous acid/urea (S/PH/U) condensates were produced. When these urea condensates were cooled down, Water-soluble products were produced, and these materials could be applied to the textile substrate using a pad-bake technique. Cotton fabrics were treated with these condensates: typically a pad-liquor contained 500 g/l of urea condensate, 10 g/I of wetting agent; fabric was padded to 80 % wet pick-up, dried (80 'C) and cured for two minutes (l 65 'C). These urea condensates, when cured on cotton at high temperature (16 S'C), change to water-insoluble products; as a result of reactions between cellulose hydroxyl group and the urea condensate a complicated polymer structure network can be produced on the surface of a fabric and a flame retardant effect imparted. The SIU condensate only produced partial FR properties, {{while the rest of the}} compounds produced completely flame retardant fabrics. FT-IR analysis and NMR analysis was carried out on the urea condensates and also on the flame retardant fabrics. DSC thermal analysis was performed on the initial materials, urea condensates and also the treated fabrics. The characterization of urea condensate treated fabrics were studied further using SEM and energy dispersion X-ray micro analysis. In the case of the urea condensates a small amount of sulphamic acid has a significant influence on the reaction between phosphating agents and urea; in fact the presence of SA reduces the exothennic reaction. However, at high concentrations of urea, the exothermic reaction occurred at a higher temperature and a hard crystalline product was produced, thus application required dissolution in warm water (50 •C). A urea condensate of 1 mole sulphamic acid, 1 mole phosphorus acid and up to 18 moles of urea could produce a durable flame retardant finish on cotton fabric. A higher amount of phosphorous acid in the urea ~ondensate products (IS/ 2 PH/IOU) reduced the exotherm temperature and a high quality flame retardant effect was produced on cotton fabric. The evenness of phosphorus and sulphur elemental distribution on the surface and cross section of treated fibre was confirmed using SEM. Desirable flame retardancy effects from the urea condensate treated fabrics were obtained with comparatively low levels of sulphur and phosphorus (in comparison with the current commercially available Proban and Pyrovatex treated fabrics). However, in the washing process of the condensate-treated fabr ics, no significant reduction in P or S concentration/level was found. The excellent flame retardancy of the new system can be explained due to the N/P/S containing polymer formed on the surface of the fabric. DSC results from the treated fabrics confirmed these observations. Fabrics treated with Pro ban and Pyrovatex showed a very sharp exotherm after 300 'C, but for fabrics treated with the urea condensates only a small exotherm effect appeared. In FT-IR analysis and NMR analysis, the production of aliphatic polymer chains of different length was verified, however, for the insoluble product formed in situ by heating at 160 'C, and also for the condensates formed on the fabric at high temperature, a complicated polymer structure was shown to contain a possible combination of cyanuric acid, cyclic urea, triazine and melamine. All these materials have been identified in the FT-IR spectra of a water- insoluble urea product formed at 160 •C. To make a model reaction with other hydroxyl group-containing substrates, starch and polyvinyl alcohol were treated with the ISI 2 PH/IOU condensate. The flame retardancy effect on both these treated substrates was confirmed by DSC thermal analysis. Advantages of this new wash-durable FR system over the currently available Proban/Pyrovatex systems include: no formaldehyde, low cost, ready availability of materials, simplicity of the treatment (no specific equipment required), and maintenance of all the desirable physical properties of the fabric, such as soft handle, acceptable tensile strength, no effect on dyed grounds and also no yellowing of the fabric.
