5|$|However, the {{municipal}} government {{explained that the}} relocation is due to <b>urbanization,</b> rather than the dam, and people involved included other areas of {{the municipal}}ity.|$|E
5|$|Capybaras {{have adapted}} {{well to the}} <b>urbanization</b> in South America. They {{can be found in}} many areas in zoos and parks, and may live for 12 years in captivity. Capybaras are gentle and usually allow humans to pet and hand-feed them, but {{physical}} contact is normally discouraged, as their ticks can be vectors to Rocky Mountain spotted fever.|$|E
5|$|Since 1770, all Australian quoll {{species have}} {{declined}} in number owing to habitat loss caused by <b>urbanization.</b> The northern quoll {{is threatened by}} toxic cane toads, but a University of Sydney project revealed in 2010 is teaching them to avoid eating the invasive amphibians.|$|E
5|$|The {{buildings}} {{in the northern part}} of the mound indicative <b>urbanization,</b> with people of different ethnic groups—Indian and non-Indian—but it has not been possible to date them in view of the limited depth of excavations.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Poland from 1945 to 1989 spans {{the period of}} Soviet {{communist}} dominance imposed {{after the end of}} World War II over what had become the Polish People's Republic. These years, while featuring general industrialization and <b>urbanization</b> and many improvements in the standard of living in Poland, were marred by social unrest and severe economic difficulties.|$|E
5|$|The war-time economy {{provided}} a boom to Indiana's industry and agriculture, {{which led to}} more <b>urbanization</b> throughout the 1920s. By 1925, more workers were employed in industry than in agriculture in Indiana. Indiana's greatest industries were steel production, iron, automobiles, and railroad cars.|$|E
5|$|<b>Urbanization</b> {{can result}} in the {{fragmentation}} of contiguous natural landscapes into patchy habitat within an urban area. Animals that live in these fragmented areas often have reduced movement between the habitat patches, {{which can lead to}} reduced gene flow and pathogen transmission between patches. Animals such as the bobcat are particularly sensitive to fragmentation because of their large home ranges. A study in coastal Southern California has shown bobcat populations are affected by <b>urbanization,</b> creation of roads, and other developments. The populations may not be declining as much as predicted, but instead the connectivity of different populations is affected. This leads to a decrease in natural genetic diversity among bobcat populations. For bobcats, preserving open space in sufficient quantities and quality is necessary for population viability. Educating local residents about the animals is critical, as well, for conservation in urban areas.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 80 {{percent of the}} Abrahams Creek {{watershed}} is rural and 20 percent is urbanized. The lower reaches of the watershed contain most of the <b>urbanization.</b> Its upper reaches contain second-growth forest, small patches of residential land, linear hedgerows, and agricultural land such as hay pastures, pastures, and farmland. The Bunker Hill-Mount Lookout Ridge is too steep to be developed, but many {{other areas of the}} watershed could easily be urbanized. The mining-affected land in the watershed is in West Wyoming.|$|E
5|$|Destruction and {{encroachment}} {{of habitat}} by humans is another threat to loggerhead sea turtles. Optimum nesting beaches are open-sand beaches above the high-tide line. However, beach development deprives them of suitable nesting areas, {{forcing them to}} nest closer to the surf. <b>Urbanization</b> often leads to the siltation of sandy beaches, decreasing their viability. Construction of docks and marinas can destroy near-shore habitats. Boat traffic and dredging degrades habitat and can also injure or kill turtles when boats collide with turtles {{at or near the}} surface.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s, Indiana, {{like the}} rest of the nation, was {{affected}} by the Great Depression. The economic downturn had a wide-ranging negative impact on Indiana. <b>Urbanization</b> declined. Governor Paul V. McNutt's administration struggled to build from scratch a state-funded welfare system to help the overwhelmed private charities. During his administration, spending and taxes were cut drastically in response to the Depression. The state government was completely reorganized. McNutt also enacted the state's first income tax. On several occasions, he declared martial law to put an end to worker strikes.|$|E
5|$|During the {{communist}} era, rapid <b>urbanization</b> {{and growth of}} heavy industry occurred. Whole villages in the coal mining areas were destroyed by the mining activity. These conditions quickened the assimilation of the Poles. Another cause of assimilation was {{the high rate of}} intermarriage. Besides Poles belonging to the minority, many more commuted across the border from Polish People's Republic to work in Czechoslovakia or {{to take advantage of the}} relative abundance of consumer goods in Czechoslovakia.|$|E
5|$|In the North, <b>urbanization</b> and an {{unprecedented}} influx {{of immigrants from}} Southern and Eastern Europe supplied a surplus of labor for the country's industrialization and transformed its culture. National infrastructure including telegraph and transcontinental railroads spurred economic growth and greater settlement {{and development of the}} American Old West. The later invention of electric light and the telephone would also affect communication and urban life.|$|E
5|$|Much {{is written}} about the {{different}} factors that threaten the painted turtle, but they are unquantified, with only inferences of relative importance. A primary threat category is habitat loss in various forms. Related to water habitat, there is drying of wetlands, clearing of aquatic logs or rocks (basking sites), and clearing of shoreline vegetation, which allows more predator access or increased human foot traffic. Related to nesting habitat, <b>urbanization</b> or planting can remove needed sunny soils.|$|E
5|$|Since {{its opening}} in 2005, the {{shopping}} center has dealt with constant vacancy rates, despite the <b>urbanization</b> of Maple Grove and its surrounding communities. Many of the center's tenants are vacant, but vacancy rates have decreased over the years. The center was originally developed and managed by Ryan Companies US, Inc., but was acquired by Hempel Properties in January 2016 for $19.2 million. Currently, the center features national chains, including Chipotle Mexican Grill, Great Clips, and Subway.|$|E
5|$|The San Juan {{watershed}} {{is home to}} sixteen major native plant {{communities and}} hundreds of animal species. However, the watershed is projected to be 48 percent urbanized by 2050. In addition, urban runoff has changed flow patterns in San Juan Creek and introduced pollutants to the river system. Although the main stem of San Juan Creek {{does not have any}} major water diversions or dams, some of its tributaries, including Trabuco and Oso Creeks, have been channelized or otherwise heavily modified by <b>urbanization.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Southern California DPS, {{which was}} listed as {{endangered}} in 2011, has been affected by habitat loss due to dams, confinement of streams in concrete channels, water pollution, groundwater pumping, urban heat island effects, and other byproducts of <b>urbanization.</b> Steelhead in the Kamchatka Peninsula are threatened by over-harvest, particularly from poaching and potential development, and {{are listed in the}} Red Data Book of Russia that documents rare and endangered species.|$|E
5|$|The area is {{nowadays}} {{sparsely populated}} {{as the result}} of <b>urbanization</b> after World War II. Many of the dwellings now remain shut, while abandonment of the traditional rural economy has affected the cultural landscape. Epirus, of which Vikos–Aoös is part, {{is considered one of the}} most underdeveloped regions in Greece. Tourism constitutes the principal source of revenue for the local economy, although it has a highly seasonal character. Intense development in terms of accommodation and tourism infrastructure occurred in the 1980s, mainly through state initiatives.|$|E
5|$|The feudalising of {{the society}} during the Angevin rule reduced royal wealth and treasury. The {{dependence}} of the Angevin on north Italian commerce and financing by Florentine bankers were the main factors {{which led to the}} decline of the Kingdom's economy. The continuation of the economic decline combined with the increased population and <b>urbanization</b> led to decrease of agrarian production.|$|E
5|$|After the Central African Republic {{attained}} {{independence in}} 1960, developmental activities began, and the <b>urbanization</b> of Bangui ensued. This {{is evidenced by}} the population growth from 279,800 in 1975 to 427,435 in 1988 to 524,000 by 1994. and to 652,000 in 2001. Apart from the ethnic people of the country, the city is also home for a minority group of Greek, Portuguese and Yemeni traders, and also has a small community of French people. The Bangui resident community includes diamond traders from western Africa and Chad, traders from many African countries, and refugees from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria.|$|E
5|$|Although the camas {{pocket gopher}} is {{fiercely}} defensive when cornered, {{it may become}} tame in captivity. While population trends are generally stable, threats to the species' survival include <b>urbanization,</b> habitat conversion for agricultural use and active attempts at eradication with trapping and poisons. It is prey for raptors and carnivorous mammals, and host to several parasitic arthropods and worms. Scientists believe that the gopher's evolutionary history was disrupted when the Missoula Floods washed over the Willamette Valley {{at the end of}} the last ice age. The floods almost completely inundated its geographic range, which may have caused a genetic bottleneck as survivors repopulated the region after the waters receded.|$|E
5|$|Another major {{component}} of Bo's Chongqing model concerned the city's economic policies. Just {{as he had done}} in Liaoning, Bo ambitiously pursued foreign investment in the city, lowering corporate income tax rates (15% compared to the 25% national average), and sought to stimulate rapid <b>urbanization</b> and industrialization. He also carried on with policies initiated by his predecessors which focused on domestic consumption, rather than export-led growth. During his tenure, Chongqing reported annual GDP growth far exceeding the national average. In 2008, for instance, nationwide GDP growth was reported at 8%, while Chongqing reported 14.3%; the same year, foreign trade rose by 28%, and bank loans were up 29%.|$|E
5|$|Another serious effect {{created by}} the oil-related {{industries}} has been the pollution around the Houston Ship Channel and in Galveston Bay. By the 1970s, these waterways {{were among the most}} polluted waters in the United States. Though industrial sources were major sources of pollution, <b>urbanization</b> around the bay also contributed significantly to pollution levels. In recent decades, most of the pollution in the bay is the result of storm run-off from various smaller commercial, agricultural, and residential sources, as opposed to the major industrial complexes. Conservation efforts in the mid to late 20th century by area industries and municipalities have helped to dramatically improve water quality in the bay reversing {{at least some of the}} earlier damage to the ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|By 1901, the town's {{population}} had reached 5,102, and by 1931 had further doubled to 10,104. The {{early twentieth century}} saw a period of increased <b>urbanization</b> of the area; in the period from the First World War to 1937, 312 council houses were built, and public services, such as electricity supplies and sewerage, were completed. The steep gradient of the Rath was at this time constructed, and in 1939 a Town Hall was opened on Hamilton Terrace, at that time possessing an inbuilt fire station. 1939 also saw the opening of an outdoor swimming pool on the Rath.|$|E
5|$|City {{planning}} and urban lifestyles had {{been influenced by}} the Greeks from an early period, and in the eastern Empire, Roman rule accelerated and shaped the local development of cities that already had a strong Hellenistic character. Cities such as Athens, Aphrodisias, Ephesus and Gerasa altered some aspects of city {{planning and}} architecture to conform to imperial ideals, while also expressing their individual identity and regional preeminence. In the areas of the western Empire inhabited by Celtic-speaking peoples, Rome encouraged the development of urban centres with stone temples, forums, monumental fountains, and amphitheatres, often on or near the sites of the preexisting walled settlements known as oppida. <b>Urbanization</b> in Roman Africa expanded on Greek and Punic cities along the coast.|$|E
5|$|Contract {{pollination}} has overtaken {{the role}} of honey production for beekeepers in many countries. From 1972 to 2006, feral honey bees declined dramatically in the US, and they are now almost absent. The number of colonies kept by beekeepers declined slightly, through <b>urbanization,</b> systematic pesticide use, tracheal and Varroa mites, and the closure of beekeeping businesses. In 2006 and 2007 the rate of attrition increased, and was described as colony collapse disorder. In 2010 invertebrate iridescent virus and the fungus Nosema ceranae were shown to be in every killed colony, and deadly in combination. Winter losses increased to about 1/3. Varroa mites {{were thought to be}} responsible for about half the losses.|$|E
5|$|Döblin's 1924 {{science fiction}} novel recounts {{the course of}} human history from the 20th to the 27th century, portraying it as a catastrophic global {{struggle}} between technological mania, natural forces, and competing political visions. Berge Meere und Giganten (Mountains Seas and Giants) presciently invokes such topics as <b>urbanization,</b> the alienation from nature, ecological devastation, mechanization, the dehumanization of the modern world, as well as mass migration, globalization, totalitarianism, fanaticism, terrorism, state surveillance, genetic engineering, synthetic food, the breeding of humans, biochemical warfare, and others. Stylistically and structurally experimental, it {{was regarded as a}} difficult work when it first came out and has often polarized critics. Among others, Günter Grass has praised the novel's continued relevance and insight.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the crisis}} in Europe, the {{modernization}} of sericulture in Japan made it the world's foremost silk producer. By the early 20th century, rapidly industrializing Japan was producing as much as 60 percent of the world's raw silk, most exports shipping through the port of Yokohama. Italy managed to rebound from the crisis, but France was unable. <b>Urbanization</b> in Europe saw many French and Italian agricultural workers leave silk growing for more lucrative factory work. Raw silk was imported from Japan to fill the void. Asian countries, formerly exporters of raw materials (cocoons and raw silk), progressively began to export more and more finished garments.|$|E
5|$|From 1972 to 2006, {{dramatic}} reductions {{continued in}} the number of feral honey bees in the U.S. and a significant though somewhat gradual decline {{in the number of}} colonies maintained by beekeepers. This decline includes the cumulative losses from all factors, such as <b>urbanization,</b> pesticide use, tracheal and Varroa mites, and commercial beekeepers' retiring and going out of business. However, in late 2006 and early 2007, the rate of attrition was alleged to have reached new proportions, and people began to use the term colony collapse disorder to describe this sudden rash of disappearances (or sometimes spontaneous hive collapse or the Mary Celeste syndrome in the United Kingdom).|$|E
5|$|Historically, the San Juan {{watershed}} supported up to 12 invertebrate species, 5 fish species, 12 amphibian species, 35 reptile species, 143 bird species, and 42 mammal species, which {{benefited from}} the diverse vegetation communities present. Some streams and ponds host federally listed endangered/threatened species such as tidewater goby, fairy shrimp, and California red-legged frog. Federally listed bird species include least Bell's vireo, California gnatcatcher, California least tern, and southwestern willow flycatcher. Other listed species include Pacific pocket mouse and Quino checkerspot butterfly. As <b>urbanization</b> continues to increase in the San Juan watershed, most sensitive species have been pushed back to the foothills, mountains, and agricultural/ranching areas of the watershed.|$|E
5|$|In 1538, {{the current}} walls of Jerusalem were {{completed}} on {{the orders of}} Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. These walls, along with the internal walls built by the Armenians, determined {{the outline of the}} quarter. In the 1562–63 record, only 189 Armenians were counted, whereas 640 were counted by the Ottomans in 1690, an increase of 239%. According to the chronicler Simeon Lehatsi only some twelve Armenian families lived in Jerusalem in 1615–16. The significant increase in the population in 1690 is attributed to <b>urbanization</b> experienced by the Armenians and other Christians. Thus Armenians came to make up 22.9% of Jerusalem's Christians by 1690, becoming the second largest Christian community.|$|E
5|$|Most {{developing}} countries are taking steps to develop emergency medicine as a specialty, to develop accreditation mechanisms, and to promote the development of emergency medicine training programs. Their interest {{is a result of}} improved healthcare, increasing <b>urbanization,</b> aging populations, the rising number of traffic fatalities, and heightened awareness of emergency medicine among their citizens. In addition, emergency medicine is useful in dealing with time-sensitive illnesses, as well as improving public health through vaccinations, interventions, training, and data collection. Countries that lack mature EMSs are developing emergency medicine as a specialty so {{that they will be able}} to set up training programs and encourage medical students to pursue residencies in emergency medicine.|$|E
5|$|Rates of dengue {{increased}} 30fold between 1960 and 2010. This {{increase is}} believed to be due to a combination of <b>urbanization,</b> population growth, increased international travel, and global warming. The geographical distribution is around the equator. Of the 2.5billion people living in areas where it is common 70% are from Asia and the Pacific. An infection with dengue is second only to malaria as a diagnosed cause of fever among travelers returning from the developing world. It is the most common viral disease transmitted by arthropods, and has a disease burden estimated at 1,600 disability-adjusted life years per million population. The World Health Organization counts dengue as one of seventeen neglected tropical diseases.|$|E
5|$|Russel {{estimated}} the Egyptian village population to be 3.3 million in 2,300 villages, a high density for rural {{populations in the}} time period. He attributes it to the high productivity of Egyptian soil which allowed for increased agricultural growth. The urban population was much lower, 233,100, consisting of 5.7% of the total Egyptian population. The largest cities were Cairo (pop.60,000), Alexandria (pop.30,000), Qus (pop.25,000), Damietta (pop.18,000), Fayyum (pop.13,000), and Bilbeis (pop.10,000). Numerous smaller cities dotted the Nile River. Among the latter were Damanhur, Asyut, and Tanta. Cities in Egypt were also densely populated, mainly because of greater <b>urbanization</b> and industrialization than elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Since only castles {{built of}} stone and walled towns {{had been able to}} resist Mongol attacks, {{following}} the withdrawal of the Mongols the kings encouraged both the landowners and the townspeople to build stone fortifications. New stone fortresses were built, for example, at Codlea, Rimetea, and Unguraş. The process of <b>urbanization</b> was characterized by the predominance of the Saxon towns: out of the eight towns in Transylvania, only Alba Iulia and Dej were situated in the counties. A charter referring to inns, bakeries, and bathhouses in Rodna proves the city-like way of life of its inhabitants. Salt was still the most important item of trade in this period, but trading with oxen, maidservants, and wine is also documented in royal charters.|$|E
5|$|Since <b>urbanization</b> {{began in}} the 1960s, sudden high and sediment-lacking flows of {{polluted}} water began to destroy the native riparian vegetation once found along much of the creek. Exotic plants, including tobacco tree, castor bean, pampas grass, periwinkle, and Artichoke thistle, but most notably the giant reed, then replaced the historic live oaks, sycamores and alders as riparian vegetation. These plants have crowded out native vegetation, {{and in the case}} of giant reed, crowded out native animals—giant reed does not provide habitat for any native Southern California animals. These invasive species are most prevalent along upper Sulphur Creek (Sulphur Creek Reservoir prevents these plants from spreading downstream), much of the Aliso Creek mainstem, and some parts of Wood Canyon Creek.|$|E
5|$|The American {{black duck}} is {{considered}} to be aspecies of least concernby theInternational Union for Conservation of Nature(IUCN). It has long been valued as a game bird. Habitat loss due to drainage, global warming, filling of wetlands due to <b>urbanization</b> and rising sea levels are major reasons for the declining population of the American black duck. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has been purchasing and managing the habitat of this species in many areas to support the migratory stopover, wintering and breeding populations. The Atlantic Coast Joint Venture also protects habitat through restoration and land acquisition projects, mostly within their wintering and breeding areas.|$|E
