40|$|Abstract In a fifteen {{year old}} {{vineyard}} of Pinot Noir at a density of 5000 vines per hectares, {{located in the}} DOC zone Oltrepo ̀ Pavese, the influence of growing doses of distillery vinasses on vegetative growth, leaf mineral levels, grape yield and quality was tested in a four year period. Doses of vinasses were computed to apply 0 (test), 50, 100, 150 kg N hax 1. Vinasses doses were factorially combined with three levels of urea (0, 50 and 100 kg N hax 1). In plots without vinasses supply, <b>ureic</b> <b>nitrogen</b> {{reduced the number of}} blind buds and increased the potential and actual bud fertility. The application of vinasses nitrogen had a similar result, even if ureic and vinasses nitrogen had no additive effects. The most profitable grape yield was obtained by application of 50 kg hax 1 of nitrogen either in urea or in vinasses form. Highest vinasses supply improved the ripening levels of grapes increasing sugars and reducing acidity of juice. Results clearly show the possibility to use vinasses for proper vineyard fertilisation...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Housing and {{management}} conditions {{are expected to}} affect dairy cattle welfare. The animals could experience pain or distress {{as a result of}} widely accepted management practices, and possibly suffer being kept under apparently “unnatural” conditions. The animal welfare assessment requires the use of multiple indicators in order to analyse the heterogeneity of aspects involved. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare animal welfare of dairy cows reared in tie-stall and open-stall system by means of metabolic, immunological and stress related parameters. Materials and Methods: The study involved 80 pluriparous lactating cows belonging eight dairy farms located in the area of Mugello (Florence district) reared in different system: tye-stall (TS) and open-stall (OS). Ten blood samples were collected in the morning from the jugular vein using vacutainer tubes containing EDTA to estimate non esterified fatty acids (NEFA), total proteins (TP), creatinine (Creat), <b>nitrogen</b> <b>ureic</b> (BUN), betahidroxibutirrate (BHBA), aspartate-aminotransferase (AST) alanina-aminotransferase (ALT), calcium (Ca), chloride (Cl), potassium (K), oxygen free radicals (OFR), haptoglobin (HP), serum lisozyme (SL), bactericidal activity (SBA) and hair cortisol. Hair samples were carefully cut from the tail switch using clippers and were frozen at the temperature of - 20 °C; cortisol was analysed by the method described by Accorsi et al. At the same time body condition score (BCS) was recorded. The experiment was performed in accordance with European Commission regulations (86 / 609 /EEC) and Italian law (116 / 92). Results: Results showed that the housing system affected some parameters such as ALT, AST, N ureic, BHBA, OFR and cortisol. Most of these showed mean values within the range of reference without revealing signs of suffering. An interesting outcome regarded OFR level that resulted higher in the OS system likely as consequence of a higher productive effort. Results regarding hair cortisol were particularly interesting because it is known as an indicator of chronic stress: TSdisplayed significant (P< 0. 001) higher mean value than OS (2. 8 ± 1. 43 vs 1. 6 ± 1. 05 pg/mg respectively). The two housing systems did not differ for BCS, that was 3. 1 and 3. 0 respectively for both the solution. Conclusions: In this study did not emerge a situation of evident suffering in animals reared in TS. Tethered cows may have an improved welfare quality if they benefit from comfortable and clean stalls, quantitatively and qualitatively adequate feeding and watering, access to exercise and not in the least a good relationship with the stockperson...|$|R
40|$|Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) {{represent}} about 30 % of all {{causes of}} death worldwide. The development of CVD is related in many cases with the previous existence of metabolic syndrome (MS). It is known that apple consumption has a cardiovascular protecting effect, containing phenolic compounds with antioxidant effect, which are concentrated in the fruit peel. The objective {{of this study was}} to test the effect of apple peel consumption in a murine model of MS and apoE−/− mice. Apple supplemented diets reduced the biochemical parameters (glycaemia, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, <b>ureic</b> <b>nitrogen,</b> triglycerides, insulin, and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA)) of MS model in CF 1 mice significantly. The model apoE−/− mouse was used to evaluate the capacity of the apple peel to revert the progression of the atherogenesis. FD with HAP reverts cholesterol significantly and slows down the progression of the plate diminishing the cholesterol accumulation area. With these results, it can be concluded that the consumption of apple peel reduces several MS parameters and the atherogenic progression in mice...|$|E

The experiment utilized a Latin square design, with the cows distributed in four Latin squares. Intake, digestibility of nutritional fractions, and the metabolic profile, as determined from blood parameters, were analyzed for grazing cattle with a dietary supplement containing 0, 25, 50, and 75 % of palm kernel cake. Intake of dry matter, crude protein, ether extract, neutral detergent fiber, nonfibrous carbohydrates, total carbohydrates, and total digestible nutrients within the supplement, as well as the intake of total crude protein, total ether extract, and total nonfibrous carbohydrates, were negatively influenced by level of Palm kernel cake supplementation. The digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, nonfibrous carbohydrate, and total carbohydrates was significantly reduced with an increased percentage of Palm kernel cake in the supplement. The concentration of blood glucose was not affected by the amount of Palm kernel cake (P> 0. 05). However, these averages of <b>ureic</b> <b>nitrogen</b> are still considered to be physiological norms.

A síntese da proteína microbiana foi estimada utilizando-se os derivados de purina na urina e no leite. Amostras de sangue e amostras spot de urina foram coletadas aproximadamente quatro horas após a alimentação da manhã. Houve efeito das dietas sobre o volume urinário e a excreção de ureia na urina. O menor volume urinário (18, 84 L) foi observado com farelo de soja+ureia. As excreções de ureia na urina foram semelhantes entre a soja crua (532, 98 mg/kgPV) e a soja tostada (524, 41 mg/kgPV) e diferiram entre o farelo de soja (561, 56 mg/kgPV) e o farelo de soja+ureia (575, 71 mg/kgPV). A forma de fornecimento da soja não teve efeito no balanço de nitrogênio e nas concentrações do nitrogênio ureico no plasma (NUP), mas teve efeito significativo no nitrogênio ureico no leite (NUL), cuja maior média foi obtida com a soja crua (15, 66 mg/dL). As médias de alantoína na urina (416, 45 mmol/dia) e no leite (12, 78 mmol/dia), dos derivados de purinas totais (468, 30 mmol/dia), da síntese de proteína microbiana (287, 33 g/dia) e da eficiência da síntese microbiana (133, 06), expressa em g de PB/kg de NDT consumido, não diferiram entre as dietas. As dietas testadas não afetaram o balanço de nitrogênio nem a produção microbiana, porém a inclusão de grãos de soja crus aumentou os teores de nitrogênio ureico no leite.

Two stocking systems were tested, in which cattle were allowed to graze: (1) after grazing cycles of 30 days (T 30 d); or (2) when the sward reached a pre-grazing height of 70 cm (T 0. 7 m). Five grazing cycles, each consisting of a sward recovery period followed by 2 days of grazing, were evaluated in each stocking system using a completely randomized block design and repeated measures with 2 repetitions per stocking system (each composed {{of a set of}} sixteen 4000 m 2 paddocks grazed sequentially). Four 1 m× 1 m sward patches were collected, constituting one sample per paddock, which was used to evaluate pre-grazing herbage mass, leaf, stem and dead matter (dry mass per area), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDFom), acid detergent fiber (ADFom) and hemicellulose (HEM). Cows received daily supplementation of 4 kg concentrate. Stocking rate, milk production and composition were evaluated in each grazing cycle. The T 30 d stocking system produced higher (P= 0. 0014) pre-grazing height than T 0. 7 m (0. 83 vs 0. 69 cm), had higher (P= 0. 0071) light interception (94 vs 91 %) and higher (P= 0. 0233) leaf area index (5. 2 vs 4. 5). In addition, T 30 d exhibited larger (P= 0. 0204) herbage mass than T 0. 7 m (7276 vs 6187 kg MS/ha), higher (P= 0. 0243) leaf dry mass per area (2618 vs 2294 kg/ha) and higher (P< 0. 0001) stocking rate (6. 2 vs 5. 7 animal/ha). The grazing cycle affected sward composition, with T 30 d producing higher (P= 0. 0060) leaf NDFom. Milk production and composition was not affected by the stocking systems, as follows (T 30 d vs T 0. 7 m) : 20. 12 vs 20. 94 kg milk production per cow/day; 31. 4 vs 31. 9 gfat/kg, 29. 9 vs 30. 2 gprotein/kg, 43. 7 vs 44. 6 glactose/kg, 114. 8 vs 116. 5 g/kg total solids and 12. 85 vs 12. 86 mg/dL <b>ureic</b> <b>nitrogen.</b> Stocking system therefore affects the nutritive value of sward.
