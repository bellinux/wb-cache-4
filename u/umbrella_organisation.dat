The National Federation of Cypriots in the UK, an <b>umbrella</b> <b>organisation</b> {{representing}} the Cypriot community associations and groups across the UK with largely Greek Cypriot memberships, claims to represent more than 300,000 people of Cypriot ancestry, {{although they do}} not state {{whether or not this}} includes non-Greek Cypriots. A similar figure was given by then Minister for Europe Caroline Flint, who, giving a speech at the London School of Economics in February 2009, stated that more than 300,000 Greek and Turkish Cypriots were living in the UK.|$|E

25|$|Since its foundation, the Cartellverband only {{accepted}} into its structure one fraternity from every university, called {{the principle of}} singularity. Those fraternities, which were denied membership founded other <b>umbrella</b> <b>organisations,</b> like the Katholische Deutsche Verband farbentragender Studentenkorporationen (KDV), sharing the same principles as the CV. In 1907 the principle of singularity was abolished. Now the former members of these <b>umbrella</b> <b>organisations</b> could join the Cartellverband, which structure and membership exploded.|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of long delays, many {{environmental}} groups from France, Italy and Switzerland have worked together under the <b>umbrella</b> <b>organisation,</b> proMONT BLANC, to jointly raise concerns and {{to put pressure on}} national governments and the European Union to support and make quicker progress with World Heritage classification. In 2012 the organisation published a detailed assessment and supportive rationale into the state of the Mont Blanc application to be a World Heritage Site. ProMont Blanc also undertakes reviews of a suite of 24 environmental, 24 economic and 10 social indicators across 15 towns around the massif (seven French, five Italian and three Swiss), and monitors and reports on the effectiveness of measures intended to deliver sustainable development across the region.|$|E
5|$|Having {{achieved}} {{full control}} over the legislative and executive branches of government, Hitler and his allies began to suppress the remaining opposition. The Social Democratic Party was banned and its assets seized. While many trade union delegates were in Berlin for May Day activities, SA stormtroopers demolished union offices around the country. On 2 May 1933 all trade unions were forced to dissolve and their leaders were arrested. Some were sent to concentration camps. The German Labour Front was formed as an <b>umbrella</b> <b>organisation</b> to represent all workers, administrators, and company owners, thus reflecting the concept of national socialism {{in the spirit of}} Hitler's Volksgemeinschaft ("people's community").|$|E
5|$|Scientology is {{represented}} by {{a large number of}} independent associations or Vereine in Germany; their <b>umbrella</b> <b>organisation</b> is the Scientology Kirche Deutschland e.V. Germany's domestic intelligence service, the Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz (BfV, or Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution), estimates that there are 4,000 Scientologists in Germany, down from earlier estimates of 5,000 to 6,000. The Church of Scientology reported around 30,000 members from the mid-1990s onwards; this number remained stable for many years. However more recently Scientology has said it has only 12,000 members. Discrepancies in Scientology membership numbers arise because the Church of Scientology applies more inclusive criteria in establishing its figures, essentially including anyone who has purchased a book or participated in courses, regardless of their subsequent involvement. The number of contractually bound Scientology staff members working in German Scientology organizations is unlikely to exceed a few hundred.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of Freemasonry considers the Liberal (Continental) strand to be Irregular, and thus withhold recognition. For the Continental lodges, however, having {{a different approach}} to Freemasonry was not a reason for severing masonic ties. In 1961, an <b>umbrella</b> <b>organisation,</b> Centre de Liaison et d'Information des Puissances maçonniques Signataires de l'Appel de Strasbourg (CLIPSAS) was set up, which today provides a forum for most of these Grand Lodges and Grand Orients worldwide. Included in the list of over 70 Grand Lodges and Grand Orients are representatives of all three of the above categories, including mixed and women's organisations. The United Grand Lodge of England does not communicate with any of these jurisdictions, and expects its allies to follow suit. This creates the distinction between Anglo-American and Continental Freemasonry.|$|E
5|$|Still {{friends with}} Martello, Buczynski {{initiated}} him up till the third degree of the Welsh Traditionalist tradition, in return receiving third degree initiation into the Strega tradition. At the same time, {{he was facing}} problems within his own tradition as one couple running their own Welsh outer coven, Claudia and Gerard Nero, had decided to abandon Buczynski's tradition and receive initiation into Gardnerianism from the Kneitals; they had ultimately decided to do so after becoming increasingly sceptical of his historical claims to Palaeolithic roots. They took their initiates, including Margot Adler, with them, much to Buczynski and Slater's annoyance, leading to {{a breakdown of the}} friendship that they had had with the Kneitals. His tradition nevertheless continued to grow and spread, and in January 1973, the tradition joined the Council of Earth Religions (COER), a pan-Pagan <b>umbrella</b> <b>organisation</b> founded the previous year to work for the common defence of the movement. His primary inner coven grew to a size that it had to divide into two at Midsummer 1973. His high priestess, Kay Smith, decided to take lead of one of them, while Eddie remained in the other, being joined by a new ritual consort named Judith. By August, there were two outer court covens of the Welsh tradition in New York City, and one each in Philadelphia and in Hopewell, Virginia.|$|E

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of health {{innovation}} in developing countries and the increased importance of biopharmaceutical industry associations in influencing innovative performance require new thinking about the business and politics institutions which diffuse and govern knowledge in emerging contexts {{of economic and political}} pluralism. This paper examines the extent to which biopharmaceutical industry associations and their <b>umbrella</b> <b>organisations</b> promote the development of technological capabilities and effective governance of health innovation. It is based on data gathered through an empirical study of such associations in India and South Africa. These data suggest that biopharmaceutical industry associations and <b>umbrella</b> <b>organisations</b> constitute public actors which play key roles in the politics of health innovation and development of both countries. Despite differences, biopharmaceutical industry associations and <b>umbrella</b> <b>organisations</b> in India and South Africa not only diffuse knowledge to health innovation systems but also actively engage in an uneven relationship with government influencing innovation policy and regulations...|$|R
