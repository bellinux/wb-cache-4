25|$|Throughout the crisis, Turkey had {{repeatedly}} {{stated that it}} would be <b>upset</b> <b>if</b> the Jupiter missiles were removed. Italy's Prime Minister Amintore Fanfani, who was also Foreign Minister ad interim, offered to allow withdrawal of the missiles deployed in Apulia as a bargaining chip. He gave the message to one of his most trusted friends, Ettore Bernabei, the general manager of RAI-TV, to convey to Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. Bernabei was in New York to attend an international conference on satellite TV broadcasting. Unknown to the Soviets, the US regarded the Jupiter missiles as obsolescent and already supplanted by the Polaris nuclear ballistic submarine missiles.|$|E
25|$|Study has {{indicated}} that most non-Asian Americans do not generally differentiate between Asian Americans of different ethnicities. Stereotypes of Chinese Americans and Asian Americans are nearly identical. A 2002 survey of Americans' attitudes toward Asian Americans and Chinese Americans indicated that 24% of the respondents disapprove of intermarriage with an Asian American, second only to African Americans; 23% would be uncomfortable supporting an Asian American presidential candidate, compared to 15% for an African American, 14% for a woman and 11% for a Jew; 17% would be <b>upset</b> <b>if</b> {{a substantial number of}} Asian Americans moved into their neighborhood; 25% had somewhat or very negative attitude toward Chinese Americans in general. The study did find several positive perceptions of Chinese Americans: strong family values (91%); honesty as business people (77%); high value on education (67%).|$|E

25|$|Many gay men {{and lesbians}} had children, {{especially}} if they had been previously married. Over 50 per cent of homosexuals who had been married had children. When they asked homosexuals whether they would be disturbed if their own children became homosexual, between 25 and 33 per cent said yes. Between 69 and 77 per cent said {{that they would not be}} upset, or only a little <b>upset,</b> <b>if</b> one of their children became homosexual. Compared to heterosexuals, homosexuals were much less likely to marry: 25 per cent of homosexuals married and 75 per cent did not, while for heterosexuals, the proportions were roughly reversed. When homosexuals did marry, they had less heterosexual intercourse and fewer children than heterosexuals. Some other findings were that 1 per cent of gay men were attracted to feminine qualities in a man, that gay men had little interest in competitive sport, and that older gay men were more likely than younger gay men to concentrate on fellatio. Bell and Weinberg were unable to explain the finding about sport, and were wary of concluding that the differences in sexual behavior between older and younger gay men represented a shift in sexual mores.|$|E

500|$|Russula densifolia, {{commonly}} known as the crowded russula or the reddening russula, is a species of agaric fungus in the family Russulaceae. It was first described in 1833 and given its current name in 1876. A widespread species, it is found in Asia, Europe, and North America, where it fruits on the ground in mixed and deciduous forests. Fruit bodies (mushrooms) are robust and squat, with caps up to [...] in diameter, and stems that are [...] long by [...] thick. The mushrooms are characterized by the red and then black color changes that occur in the flesh when it is bruised, and a relatively thick cap cuticle. Although the mushroom is sold as an edible species in some areas of Asia, it is mild to moderately toxic, and may cause gastrointestinal <b>upset</b> <b>if</b> consumed. Several bioactive compounds have been isolated and identified from the mushroom.|$|E
500|$|The two-colored bolete {{has several}} {{species that are}} similar to it and the {{differences}} are minute in most cases. Boletus sensibilis differs from the two-colored bolete in that it has an immediate bruising reaction and is poisonous, causing stomach <b>upset</b> <b>if</b> ingested, and in some cases a severe allergic reaction. B.miniato-olivaceus has a full yellow stem and slightly lighter cap coloration. It also has a more immediate bruising reaction than the two-colored bolete and the stem is slightly longer in proportion to the cap. B.peckii differs from the two-colored bolete by having a smaller average size, a rose red cap that turns almost brown with age, flesh that is paler in color, and a bitter taste. B.speciosus differs from the two-colored bolete by having a fully reticulated stem, more brilliant colors, and very narrow cylindrical spores. Hortiboletus rubellus subsp. rubens and the two-colored bolete have been found to have almost no difference between them, and they cannot be distinguished by appearance alone. Boletus bicoloroide is very similar to the two-colored bolete, the major differences between them being B.bicoloroide has only been found in Michigan and has larger spores. B.bicoloroide is also slightly larger than the two-colored bolete, around [...] longer in the stem and [...] in the cap. This species has not been as thoroughly researched as the two-colored bolete, thus macrochemical tests, edibility, distribution range, and the spore print color are all unknown.|$|E

40|$|This paper explores some {{contemporary}} {{practices in}} using creative writing in recovery from mental illness to consider {{ways in which}} undergraduate and postgraduate creative writing programmes might integrate resilience-building techniques for those students who may find some writing exercises ‘triggering’ or detrimental to their mental health. The question is also raised as to whether creative writing programmes should and can integrate resilience techniques, as many students draw upon material from their personal lives, and this can often prove <b>upsetting,</b> <b>if</b> not traumatising. The article argues that resilience techniques might enable students to manage ‘raw’ material and personal narratives in a positive way, and therefore become better creative writers. The article concludes by proposing a creative writing intervention that incorporates resilience and other strategies that support mental wellbeing...|$|R
