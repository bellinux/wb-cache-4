50|$|Progress M-16M {{departed}} the Pirs Docking Compartment at 13:15:27 GMT on February 9, 2013 {{performing a}} nominal <b>undocking</b> <b>to</b> begin {{a very short}} free flight.|$|R
50|$|It {{remained}} docked to {{the space}} station until 20 February 2011 when it <b>undocked</b> <b>to</b> make way for the Johannes Kepler Automated Transfer Vehicle. After undocking it was deorbited to a destructive reentry over the spacecraft cemetery in the Pacific Ocean. Filled with trash and spent equipment on board the ISS, Progress M-07M drowned in the Pacific Ocean at 7:58 pm Moscow time.|$|R
5|$|Prior to Endeavour docking, the Russian {{resupply}} spacecraft Progress M1-4, {{which came}} to the station in mid-November, was <b>undocked</b> <b>to</b> {{make room for the}} space shuttle. This Progress spacecraft remained undocked for the duration of STS-97, parked in orbit about a mile away from the station. It docked manually again with the station on 26 December by Gidzenko, after Endeavour left. The automatic docking system for this Progress spacecraft had failed on the first docking in November. The crew spent much of the following week unloading the Progress spacecraft.|$|R
5000|$|On 18 August 1942 Captain H. W. U. McCall brought Dido to Massawa {{for major}} repairs to a bomb-damaged stern. As Dido {{was at that}} time one-quarter of British surface power in the Eastern Mediterranean it was {{critical}} that she be repaired as quickly as possible. The only working drydock in Massawa was not large enough to lift Dido entirely so she was partially floated up to clear the stern, leaving the bow low in the water. Six days later Dido was <b>undocked</b> <b>to</b> return to battle alongside her three sister ships, Euryalus, Cleopatra and [...] Dido then {{spent the rest of the}} year supporting the British campaign in North Africa before being transferred to the Western Mediterranean Fleet in December 1942. Dido then performed the duty of anti-aircraft guard at Bone and Algiers until March 1943.|$|R
50|$|The Progress M-06M {{spacecraft}} {{loaded with}} trash {{and other items}} for disposal, undocked from the International Space Station at 11:25 UTC on 31 August 2010. This was slightly behind schedule: the command for the spacecraft <b>to</b> <b>undock</b> was intended <b>to</b> have been issued from the ISS at 11:19 UTC, resulting in undocking three minutes later.|$|R

50|$|Day 8 of STS-115, {{the last}} full day with Space Shuttle Atlantis docked to the ISS, was mainly spent in {{preparation}} for the <b>undocking</b> procedures <b>to</b> occur in flight day 9. The crew spent the morning resting following their highly successful mission, and then began getting ready for the undocking by carrying out transfers of ISS equipment and science experiments onto Atlantis ready for the trip home.|$|R
50|$|The cosmonauts boarded Soyuz 21 but as Volynov tried <b>to</b> <b>undock</b> {{from the}} station, the docking latches failed to release properly. As he fired the jets {{to move the}} {{spacecraft}} away, the docking mechanism jammed, resulting in the Soyuz being undocked but still linked to Salyut. As the two spacecraft moved {{out of range of}} ground communications, the cosmonauts received only the first set of emergency procedures. Volynov tried a second time <b>to</b> <b>undock</b> but only managed slightly to loosen the latches. The situation persisted for an entire orbit, 90 minutes, when the final set of emergency procedures were received and the crew finally disengaged the latches.|$|R
50|$|The Soyuz {{spacecraft}} {{was launched}} on 10 December 1977, and docked {{with the space}} station the next day. Soyuz 27 arrived at the station in January 1978, and its two-person crew transferred into the Soyuz 26 spacecraft <b>to</b> <b>undock</b> and land a few days later.|$|R
5000|$|Salyut 5, {{launched}} on June 22, 1976, {{was equipped with}} an improved radio system. On July 6, 1976, Soyuz 21 had problems undocking automatically, but was able <b>to</b> <b>undock</b> manually. Soyuz 23 failed to dock, ran out of fuel to manual dock, and returned to Earth.|$|R
40|$|This video {{highlights}} the international cooperative Shuttle/Mir {{mission of the}} STS- 71 flight. The STS- 71 flightcrew consists of Cmdr. Robert Hoot' Gibson, Pilot Charles Precourt, and Mission Specialists Ellen Baker, Bonnie Dunbar, and Gregory Harbaugh. The Mir 18 flightcrew consisted of Cmdr. Vladamir Dezhurov, Flight Engineer Gennady Strekalov, and Cosmonaut-Research Dr. Norman Thagard. The Mir 18 crew consisted of Cmdr. Anatoly Solovyev and Flight Engineer Nikolai Budarin. The prelaunch, launch, shuttle in-orbit, and in-orbit rendezvous and docking of the Mir Space Station to the Atlantis Space Shuttle are shown. The Mir 19 crew accompanied the STS- 71 crew and will replace the Mir 18 crew upon undocking from the Mir Space Station. Shown is on-board footage from the Mir Space Station of the Mir 18 crew engaged in hardware testing and maintenance, medical and physiological tests, and {{a tour of the}} Mir. A spacewalk by the two Mir 18 cosmonauts is shown as they performed maintenance of the Mir Space Station. After the docking between Atlantis and Mir is completed, several mid-deck physiological experiments are performed along with a tour of Atlantis. Dr Thagard remained behind with the Shuttle after <b>undocking</b> <b>to</b> return to Earth with reports from his Mir experiments and observations. In-cabin experiments included the IMAX Camera Systems tests and the Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment- 2 (SAREX- 2). There is footage of the shuttle landing...|$|R
50|$|During the L3 complex's {{journey to}} the Moon, {{there would be no}} need <b>to</b> <b>undock</b> and re-dock the orbital and landing craft as was done in Apollo, because the {{cosmonaut}} would transfer from the LOK to LK by a 'spacewalk'. On the Apollo missions, the transfer was done using an internal passage.|$|R

5000|$|The three crewmembers also {{performed}} a [...] "flyaround" [...] in the Soyuz spacecraft-undocking from one docking port of the station, manually flying to and redocking the capsule {{at a different}} location-thus making Linenger the first American <b>to</b> <b>undock</b> from a space station aboard two different spacecraft (U.S. Space Shuttle and Russian Soyuz).|$|R
50|$|Upon their arrival, Skvortsov, Artemyev and Swanson {{joined the}} crew of Expedition 39, as part of which they {{remained}} until they transferred to {{the crew of}} Expedition 40 after the May 2014 departure of Soyuz TMA-11M. The crew members of TMA-12M remained aboard the ISS until September 2014, when the spacecraft <b>undocked</b> and returned <b>to</b> Earth as scheduled.|$|R
50|$|Soyuz 32 {{was loaded}} with 130 kg of {{replaced}} instruments, processed materials, exposed film and other items with a total weight {{equal to that of}} the two cosmonauts. On 13 June, it <b>undocked</b> and returned <b>to</b> Earth unmanned 295 km northwest of Dzhezkazgan. The next day, the crew redocked Soyuz 34 at the forward port to clear the aft port for Progress 7.|$|R
50|$|On 6 July 1976 Volynov and Flight Engineer Vitaliy Zholobov were {{launched}} on board Soyuz 21 to spend 18 days aboard {{the space station}} Salyut 5. Following a deterioration in the health of Zholobov, who was making his first spaceflight, {{the decision was made}} to return the crew at the earliest available opportunity and they boarded their Soyuz on 24 August. However, as Volynov tried <b>to</b> <b>undock</b> from Salyut, the latch failed to release properly. As he fired the jets to move the spacecraft away, the docking mechanism jammed, resulting in the Soyuz being undocked but still linked to Salyut. As the two spacecraft moved out of range of ground communications, only the first set of emergency procedures was received. Volynov tried a second time <b>to</b> <b>undock</b> but managed only to slightly loosen the latches. This situation persisted for an entire orbit (90 minutes), then the final set of emergency procedures were received and the latches finally disengaged.|$|R
50|$|<b>Undocking</b> {{was meant}} <b>to</b> {{come at the}} end of their {{eleventh}} orbit of the Moon, but was delayed by an improperly attached umbilical that sent the signal to the docking probe to disengage. After Worden fixed the connection, undocking and separation occurred properly about half an orbit late. The only effect of the late separation was the need to delay some landmark sighting by one orbit.|$|R
50|$|The ATV was {{initially}} planned <b>to</b> <b>undock</b> from the ISS on 25 September 2012. However, a command program error during the undocking procedure delayed the release, and Edoardo Amaldi {{did not actually}} undock until 21:44 GMT on 28 September. The spacecraft finally deorbited and performed a destructive re-entry over the Pacific Ocean on 4 October 2012, taking with it a payload of station waste.|$|R
5000|$|Following the <b>undocking</b> {{after moving}} <b>to</b> a safe {{distance}} from ISS, the Kounotori 6 was to demonstrate the [...] "Kounotori Integrated Tether Experiment (KITE)" [...] using electrodynamic tether to demonstrate space debris removal technology. This experiment was planned for seven days before reentry to the Earth's atmosphere. On Jan 31, media reported some problems in extending the tether, bringing to doubt the experiment's success.|$|R
50|$|On Rosvirein, Ky sells of {{enough of}} Osman's presumably stolen cargo {{to pay for}} repairs of her own ship and hire crewmen {{qualified}} to run the ship's missile and beam weapons. She also hires Hugh Pritang, a mercenary veteran with a prosthetic arm, to be her executive officer now that she has decided to use her letter of marque to justify seeking out and destroying the pirates who have attacked her family. When suspected pirate ships appear in the system, she undocks from the station to avoid being trapped {{in the event of}} an attack. The Rosvirein Peace Force orders all <b>undocked</b> ships <b>to</b> leave the system to prevent collusion with the pirates and so Ky is unable to wait for Stella.|$|R
40|$|On this ninth {{day of the}} STS- 101 Atlantis mission, {{the flight}} crew, Commander James D. Halsell Jr., Pilot Scott J. Horowitz, and Mission Specialists Mary Ellen Weber, Jeffrey N. Williams, James S. Voss, Susan J. Helms, and Yuri Vladimirovich Usachev prepares <b>to</b> <b>undock</b> Atlantis from the International Space Station (ISS). Atlantis is seen as it undocks form the ISS over Kazakhstan. Halsell, Usachev, and Weber are seen {{participating}} in a communication link with Russia...|$|R
50|$|Soyuz 32 {{was loaded}} with 130 kg of {{replaced}} instruments, processed materials, exposed film and other items with a total weight {{equal to that of}} the two cosmonauts. On 13 June, it <b>undocked</b> and returned <b>to</b> Earth unmanned 295 km northwest of Dzhezkazgan. The craft was found to be in good condition. The next day, the crew redocked Soyuz 34 at the forward port to clear the aft port for Progress 7, a supply tanker.|$|R
2500|$|On 5 September 2008, Jules Verne <b>undocked</b> and manoeuvred <b>to</b> an orbital {{position}} 5km {{below the}} ISS. It remained in that orbit until {{the night of}} 29 September.

50|$|E.J. becomes {{something}} of a mascot for the crew, and does what he can to help clean the cabin and perform other chores. Once in lunar orbit mission commander Rick Lawrence and lunar module pilot Dave Anderson prepare <b>to</b> <b>undock</b> from the command module and descend to the surface. But E.J. notices that Ben Pelham, the command module pilot, is ill. Ben insists that it's just a slight fever and asks E.J. to say nothing to the others.|$|R
25|$|During the Mission Status briefing, Alibaruho {{expressed}} how pleased {{the teams}} {{on the ground}} were with the successful deployment of the arrays, and commended the crew on the deployment activities. Mission Management Team Chairman LeRoy Cain noted that the team {{was working on a}} revised timetable to allow critical experiment samples to return to earth safely. The samples need to be kept in a cold environment, and in the event weather delayed the landing, the team evaluated the best way to preserve the samples. The team approved a revised flight plan that allows Discovery to delay hatch closure and <b>undocking</b> slightly, <b>to</b> allow the samples to be kept inside the station's freezer longer, while still protecting the landing date of 28 March. Instead of closing the hatch the night before undocking, the hatch would be closed on the same day, flight day eleven.|$|R
500|$|During his Increment, Linenger {{became the}} first American to conduct a spacewalk from a foreign space station {{and the first to}} test the Russian-built Orlan-M {{spacesuit}} alongside Russian cosmonaut Vasili Tsibliyev. All three crewmembers of expedition EO-23 performed a [...] "fly-around" [...] in the Soyuz spacecraft, first undocking from one docking port of the station, then manually flying to and redocking the capsule at a different location. This made Linenger the first American <b>to</b> <b>undock</b> from a space station aboard two different spacecraft (Space Shuttle and Soyuz).|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to moving itself around the station, the arm can move any object with a grapple fixture. In {{construction of the}} station the arm was used to move large segments into place. It {{can also be used}} to capture unpiloted ships like the SpaceX Dragon, the Cygnus spacecraft, and Japanese H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV) which are equipped with a standard grapple fixture which the Canadarm2 uses to capture and dock the spacecraft. The arm is also used <b>to</b> <b>undock</b> and release the spacecraft after use.|$|R

30|$|Limitations exist {{with the}} present robotic {{platform}} for staging and cytoreduction in ovarian cancer. Once the robot is docked for pelvic surgery, {{it is more difficult}} to access the upper abdomen, without having <b>to</b> <b>undock</b> and reposition the robot, or add additional ports to be able to perform the procedure. The Society of Gynecologic Oncology’s consensus statement on robotic-assisted surgery commented on its utility in ovarian cancer as poorly suited for advanced ovarian cancer due to its limitation, with conventional port placement for pelvic surgery, in gaining upper abdominal access [6].|$|R
50|$|A {{failure in}} the docking ring on the Mini-Research Module 2 (MRM2) Poisk, caused a delay in the planned landing of the Soyuz TMA-18 spacecraft. Soyuz TMA-18 was {{originally}} planned <b>to</b> <b>undock</b> and land on 24 September 2010, but instead undocked less than 24 hours later on 25 September 2010. The failure {{is believed to be}} due to a faulty indication from a micro-switch on the hatch between the Soyuz and MRM2. A drive gear, which is related to the docking mechanism was also found to have two broken teeth, and is believed {{to be related to the}} problem as well.|$|R
50|$|Armstrong {{reported}} that the OAMS fuel had dropped to 30%, indicating that the problem could be on their own spacecraft. With concern that the high yaw rate might damage one or both spacecraft or even cause the propellant-heavy Agena to rupture or explode, the crew decided <b>to</b> <b>undock</b> from the Agena so they could analyze the situation. Scott switched the Agena control back to ground command, while Armstrong struggled to stabilize the combined vehicle enough <b>to</b> permit <b>undocking.</b> Scott then hit the undock button, and Armstrong fired a long burst of translation thrusters {{to back away from}} the Agena.|$|R

40|$|Analysis and {{interpretation}} of the lunar gravity measurements obtained from Apollo 15 Doppler radio tracking data. The extent of surface coverage {{was limited to the}} trajectory paths of the command and service module during revolutions 3 through 11, when it was at a relatively low periapsis altitude just prior <b>to</b> <b>undocking</b> with the lunar module. The trajectory was close to the most optimal for study of the details of the Serenitatis and Crisium mascons. The periapsis altitude was about 12 km at the center of Mare Serenitatis, one of the largest mascons, and the one in the most favorable viewing geometry. The results obtained strengthen Booker's (1970) contention that all mascons have approximately the same thickness...|$|R
40|$|Mooring {{systems are}} one of the less evolved ship systems. For that reason, joined to the elevate number of mooring accidents, {{nowadays}} a few companies have developed innovative automatic mooring systems. With the base of one of these innovative systems, and using TIA Portal of Siemens, a software that allows the automation of mooring and leaving the berth was created. That base has been the quick release hooks, which permit remote release and a load monitoring of ropes. Main novelty of the Project is the automation of <b>undocking</b> operation. <b>To</b> do this, first of all, different sequences depending on wind and current directions have been established. Then, through relations between wind, current and ship dimensions, the direction of resultant force of wind and current, has been calculated. In a second term, the software incorporates different innovate functions for mooring operations. The most important of these functions is the movement of the bollards. That reduces the crew operations with the windless, because the load of ropes has been adjusted with the bollard movement. The result of all of this is a program that carries out all of the desired functions...|$|R
