Despite being described as electronic music, IDM and glitch and {{not the kind of}} music a hip hop audience is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hearing,</b> Herren felt that his music was closer to hip hop.|$|E

To ears now <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hearing</b> modern tunings, even Chinese ones, traditional tunings can sound out of tune and discordant.|$|E
25|$|The noted {{director}} and producer Cheryl Crawford produced professional stock theater in Maplewood, New Jersey, for three very successful seasons. The last of these closed with Porgy and Bess, which she co-produced with John Wildberg. In re-fashioning {{it in the}} style of musical theatre which Americans were <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hearing</b> from Gershwin, Crawford produced a drastically cut version of the opera compared with the first Broadway staging. The orchestra was reduced, the cast was halved, and many recitatives were reduced to spoken dialog.|$|E

500|$|At {{some time}} during the night of 24/25 November 1974, Nick Drake died at his home ("Far Leys") in Tanworth-in-Arden, from an {{overdose}} of amitriptyline, a type of antidepressant. He {{had gone to bed}} early after spending the afternoon visiting a friend. His mother said that around dawn he left his room for the kitchen. His family was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hearing</b> him do this many times before but, during this instance, he did not make a sound. They presumed he was eating a bowl of cereal. He returned to his room a short while later, and took some pills [...] "to help him sleep".|$|E
500|$|The {{rehearsal}} {{process is}} really understated. It's funny because it's not really needed. It's not needed for us anyway. Because {{we know how}} to play the songs, and the [...] charts don't change the songs structurally at all. But the symphony charts are something that you're not <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hearing.</b> And then the symphony doesn't need the rehearsal because they sight-read. They sight-read better than we could even imagine. So when we get there, they already know how to play our songs better than we do... The purpose of the rehearsal is really, honestly to prepare the band for exactly how powerful the concert is going to be. When the symphony jumps in during those moments where all of a sudden you're singing a song you sing every night and then 30 more musicians start playing, it's so powerful that it causes you to take pause, and you can't take pause. And that's what the rehearsal really is for.|$|E
500|$|... "It Will Rain" [...] {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Billboard {{gave the}} song a 4 out of 5 starts, denoting that the song explores [...] "the darker insecurities first seen in..."Grenade"". Billboard compared the song's piano riff to the one's {{used by the}} artist himself, while the percussion and chord progression was reminiscent of [...] "OneRepublic's oeuvre more than Mars' sunny hits". The review concluded with positive feedback for the singer's [...] "pitch-perfect vocals and his knack for warbling about women troubles, the man once again delivers." [...] Scott Shetler, from the music website PopCrush, awarded the single 3,5 out of 5 starts, labeling it as [...] "more subdued than we're <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hearing</b> from Mars, but that's appropriate for a song from [...] "Twilight"." [...] Shetler also wrote that although [...] "is not a major artistic leap forward for ...the mood of the song makes it {{a good fit for}} the latest [...] "Twilight" [...] movie". While revising the music video, Metros, Aaron-Spencer Charles said, [...] "Each verse is strong with emotion and...the song [...] the right amount of lift." [...] Lyrically, Charles commented that, [...] "the emotions come from a real place and the heart-felt lyrics resonate" [...] with those who have ended a similar relationship. American singer and songwriter Adam Lambert complimented Mars' vocals and the song's melody.|$|E

500|$|Comet {{was portrayed}} by five horses, {{each with a}} {{different}} talent. The main horse was Copper, chosen by veteran wrangler Gordon Spencer because it was calm and gentle. Campbell nicknamed the horse [...] "Leadbelly" [...] due to its ability to remain calm during action or dialogue scenes. Another horse, Boss, was used for long-range shots, chase scenes, and elaborate stunts, such as leaps through windows. Ace was called in when the crew had to shoot scenes in which the horse reared. Near {{the end of the}} season, a horse named Comet was trained, its name chosen so that the horse would get <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hearing</b> it on set. The [...] "true show horse" [...] was Strip, which was adept at doing tricks, such as lip movements, head nods, and hoof stamping. According to Spencer, all those stunts [...] "as well as tying the knots and opening the door and going into rooms and all of that" [...] were done by Strip. For these scenes, Spencer would stand off-camera and use a stick to signal Strip. Campbell had a special pocket sewn into his costume and filled it with grain to reward Strip after every take. No other horse had more scenes than Strip and Copper. [...] With white colorings on his nose and legs, Strip's appearance was chosen for Brisco's steed; Copper and the other horses were touched up with [...] "clown white" [...] greasepaint to match Strip's markings.|$|E
500|$|... "Witch Doctor" [...] {{is based}} on a true story where Tinie met a girl at a show who he took with him on the tour bus and showed what it's like to live his life. [...] "It's OK" [...] and [...] "Lover Not a Fighter" [...] are two songs that feature vocals and {{production}} from Labrinth. [...] "It's OK" [...] is a contrast from the [...] "intro and fun, random bouncy things" [...] according to Okogwu. He added [...] "it's very unorthodox in the sense that people wouldn't have heard or even expect us to make a song like this because it's very slow and ballad-y. It's very reminiscent to me of the Fugees or something because it just sounds different and very soulful as well." [...] He wrote the song in Jamaica and wanted it to feel rustic and urban. Tinie wanted to [...] "push the envelope" [...] with what you're <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hearing</b> from him and Labrinth. [...] "Lover Not a Fighter" [...] is a feel-good, radio-friendly song that incorporates hip hop and electronic music, along with rap rock, and is about good vibes and [...] "doing your thing". [...] "I'm a lover, not a fighter. I've just come to do my thing and enjoy myself so don't try and get on to me about it or try and make me feel bad about everything that's going on in my life", said Tinie to SB.TV.|$|E
500|$|... "Don't Rush" [...] has {{generally}} received critical acclaim from music critics. Rachel Brodsky of MTV gave a positive review towards the song, writing [...] "It's true -- we're not totally <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hearing</b> Kelly exploring her country side (though she is from Texas, so go figure), but {{judging by the}} vocals on [...] "Don't Rush," [...] we think we could get used to Country Kelly". Sam Wilbur of AOL Radio complimented the song for being [...] "a feel-good track with a nostalgic, classic country feel". Billy Dukes of Taste of Country gave the song four stars and a half, writing [...] "It’s difficult for a female vocalist to sound sexy without drawing criticism. Clarkson’s voice is a wine and roses romance, instead of the wanton yearn of a beauty in a too-short skirt. The original ‘American Idol’ may have found her niche." [...] Michaelangelo Matos of New York Post gave the song three stars out of five and praised Clarkson for [...] "getting completely into character" [...] and successfully delivering the emotion of the song. Mark Blankenship of Logo complimented Clarkson for embracing her country side. Calling the song as [...] "a good song", he concluded his review by writing [...] "Even better, it’s a flirty, seductive love song, not a furious break-up anthem, which is a nice change after ten years of Kelly’s heartbroken rage." [...] Chuck Dauphin of Billboard ranked [...] "Don't Rush" [...] at number eight in his list of Top 10 Country Songs of 2012, writing [...] "One of the most luscious sounding love songs I have heard in a while. It's the definition of 'Ear Candy.' If you’re not in love, you'll want to be after hear it." ...|$|E

500|$|Anniemal {{received}} acclaim {{from music}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 81, based on 23 reviews, which indicates [...] "universal acclaim". Scott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork {{referred to the}} songs as a [...] "dozen slices of stylish, sophisticated electro-pop, crisp tracks that move between the fizzy and the woozy, all anchored by Annie's breathy (sometimes almost muted) vocals." [...] The site's endorsement was uncommon during a period when sites covering independent music were often dismissive of pop acts. In his review for AllMusic, Andy Kellman described Anniemal as [...] "cunning" [...] but also [...] "deeply affecting". Dylan Hicks' review for The Village Voice stated that the blogosphere and British music press overrated Anniemal but that [...] "an overrated good record is still a good record". Jody Rosen wrote for The New York Times that the album [...] "is a true album, strong from top to bottom" [...] and that [...] "there is charm in [...] deadpan delivery, and her songwriting is full of the flair for melody for which Scandinavian pop is famous." [...] Rosen also contributed a review to Slate, where she noted that [...] "other singers have made whole careers out of singles less winning than 'Chewing Gum,' but [...] includes several other superb songs". Kitty Empire's review in The Observer stated that the album's songs [...] "boast a winning combination of innocence and experience, breezy blonde melodies and just-so productions". PopMatters Pierre Hamilton called Anniemal [...] "riveting" [...] for how [...] "it lacks the waxy sheen" [...] that listeners were <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hearing</b> in manufactured pop music. However, a second PopMatters review, written by Rob Horning, criticised the album for using a similar formula to previous generations of electropop, adding that the result was [...] "exquisitely empty…enough to suck the feelings out of its listeners and leave them happily vacant, blank and unburdened." [...] In his review for Billboard magazine, Michael Paoletta described the album as [...] "slinky and sensual, cool and classy, fun and fiery" [...] and labeled it [...] "one of the best debut albums of 2005." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kristyn of Pop Culture Madness {{gave the}} album {{positive}} review, and praised its honestly stating, [...] "The tracks take the listener on a musical journey, painting vivid imagery and {{allowing us to}} lose ourselves in the albums haunting melodies and tribal rhythms. Sully Erna truly shows his amazing versatility as an artist, and the lyrical content exposes Erna’s more vulnerable side, which we don’t always get to see, as we are <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hearing</b> the aggressive side of him with Godsmacks’ tunes.", she added, [...] "Tracks like “Broken Road” and “7 Years” show raw honesty, which is something we see very little of in today’s music landscape." ...|$|E
2500|$|In September 2012, it was {{announced}} that Michele had signed a recording contract to release her debut studio album. Recording for the album began the following month, on October 19, 2012.

2500|$|Nirvana taped its {{performance}} for MTV Unplugged on November 18, 1993, at Sony Studios in New York City.

[...] Nirvana was augmented by guitarist Pat Smear and cellist Lori Goldston, who had been touring with the band. Despite the show's premise, Cobain insisted on running his acoustic guitar through his amplifier and effects pedals. Coletti built a fake box {{in front of the}} amplifier to disguise it as a monitor wedge. Coletti said, [...] "It was Kurt's security blanket.

2500|$|Arion Berger of Rolling Stone, however, was not positive. Berger {{criticized the}} songs as being [...] "pitched {{too high for}} her register", while calling the {{production}} [...] "cheap". Berger also observed that [...] "love has dulled whatever street edge she might have had". Similarly, The Village Voices Jon Caramanica was unfavorable, writing: [...] "This Is Me is like the gift you get from your grandmother—awkward, unwanted, and blindly self-righteous. Used to have a little, and still does." [...] Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani {{on the other hand}} gave the album a favorable review stating that [...] "This Is Me...Then manages to find the right formula for Lopez's slinky vocal and is more unified than its predecessors". Cinquemani felt that [...] "Lopez will no doubt earn a grain of respect from critics". Yahoo! Music's James Poletti was also positive, stating that while Lopez's voice [...] "frequently sounds a trifle thin accompanied by the sort of sounds that we're better <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hearing</b> behind a Creative Source or Gwen McCrae vocal", the [...] "honeyed backing massages any real concerns from your mind".|$|E
2500|$|Merengue típico {{songs are}} {{generally}} composed in two parts. The first section is rhythmically straightforward {{and is used}} to introduce the song's melodic and lyrical material; here, verses are sung and the only improvisation heard occurs {{at the end of}} song lines, when the accordion or saxophone fills in. The second section is dominated by improvisation, more complex rhythms, and hard-driving mambo, or the part of the song where melody instruments (sax and accordion) unite to play catchy, syncopated riffs or jaleos which help motivate and stimulate dancers. Típico rhythms include merengue derecho, or straight-ahead merengue, which is the kind of fast-paced [...] time merengue most of us are <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hearing,</b> usually used in the first section. Pambiche or merengue apambichao is similar but usually slower, and can be recognized by the double slap rhythm on the tambora. Guinchao is a third rhythm combining the first two that is commonly heard in the second section of a merengue. Típico groups do not have to limit themselves to merengue as they can also play other traditional rhythms from the Dominican Republic and elsewhere, though this was more common in the past than at present. Mangulina and guaracha are now seldom heard; the latter is a clave-based style in [...] originally from Cuba, while the former is a [...] dance native to the DR. Paseo was a slow introduction to a merengue song during which couples would promenade around the dance floor in stately fashion. Orquesta or big band merengue became the merengue of choice for the urban Dominican middle and upper classes in the twentieth century. Although merengue had been played in upper class salons as early as the 1850s, moralists like then-president Ulises Espaillat succeeded in banning the dance from such locations only two decades later, causing the merengue to effectively die out in the cities. Still, it was kept alive by rural musicians such as accordionist/composer Nico Lora, and it began to reappear in towns of the Cibao during the 1910s.|$|E
