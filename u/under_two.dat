5|$|A UTI affects {{parts of}} the urinary system {{including}} the urethra, bladder, and kidneys. There is about a one percent risk of UTIs in boys <b>under</b> <b>two</b> years of age, {{and the majority of}} incidents occur {{in the first year of}} life. There is good but not ideal evidence that circumcision of babies reduces the incidence of UTIs in boys <b>under</b> <b>two</b> years of age, and there is fair evidence that the reduction in incidence is by a factor of 310 times (100 circumcisions prevents one UTI). Prevention of UTIs does not justify routine use of the procedure, however. Circumcision is most likely to benefit boys who have a high risk of UTIs due to anatomical defects, and may be used to treat recurrent UTIs.|$|E

5|$|A second tournament, the Cromwell Cup {{was played}} a year later. This {{time it was}} only open to teams <b>under</b> <b>two</b> years old. Out of the four teams that competed The Wednesday emerged victorious. The final was a goalless draw after 90minutes so the teams played on until a goal was scored. This was the first {{instance}} where a match involved extra time. This {{would be the last}} tournament to be played in Sheffield for nine years until the formation of the Sheffield Football Association Challenge Cup in 1876.|$|E
5|$|A set of {{elements}} <b>under</b> <b>two</b> binary operations, + and −, {{is called a}} Euclidean domain if it forms a commutative ring R and, roughly speaking, if a generalized Euclidean algorithm can be performed on them. The two operations of such a ring need not be the addition and multiplication of ordinary arithmetic; rather, they can be more general, such as the operations of a mathematical group or monoid. Nevertheless, these general operations should respect many of the laws governing ordinary arithmetic, such as commutativity, associativity and distributivity.|$|E

5|$|In Europe, {{occupation}} came <b>under</b> <b>two</b> forms. In Western, Northern, and Central Europe (France, Norway, Denmark, the Low Countries, and the annexed {{portions of}} Czechoslovakia) Germany established economic policies through which it collected roughly 69.5 billion reichmarks (27.8 billion US Dollars) {{by the end}} of the war, this figure does not include the sizeable plunder of industrial products, military equipment, raw materials and other goods. Thus, the income from occupied nations was over 40 per cent of the income Germany collected from taxation, a figure which increased to nearly 40 per cent of total German income as the war went on.|$|E

This study highlights the unequal distribution of labor between partners. Of the people surveyed, under fifteen percent of the couples agreed on doing around the same amount of work in the house. About 83 percent of women participated in housecleaning and food preparation compared to only 51 percent of men who were surveyed.|$|E

5|$|Medical {{complications}} {{are associated}} with a bad prognosis. Examples are hypotension (low blood pressure), hypoxia (low blood oxygen saturation), lower cerebral perfusion pressures and longer times spent with high intracranial pressures. Patient characteristics also influence prognosis. Factors thought to worsen it include abuse of substances such as illicit drugs and alcohol and age over sixty or <b>under</b> <b>two</b> years (in children, younger age at time of injury may be associated with a slower recovery of some abilities). Other influences that may affect recovery include pre-injury intellectual ability, coping strategies, personality traits, family environment, social support systems and financial circumstances.|$|E

5|$|Prey (known as Alien Prey in some markets) is a 1977 British {{independent}} {{science fiction}} horror film produced by Terry Marcel {{and directed by}} Norman J. Warren.

It was filmed in <b>under</b> <b>two</b> weeks on a budget of less than £60,000 in various locations near Shepperton Studios in Surrey. It had a limited distribution on release.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian tree sparrow's untidy nest {{is built}} in a natural cavity, a hole in a {{building}} or the large nest of a European magpie or white stork. The typical clutch is five or six eggs which hatch in <b>under</b> <b>two</b> weeks. This sparrow feeds mainly on seeds, but invertebrates are also consumed, particularly during the breeding season. As with other small birds, infection by parasites and diseases, and predation by birds of prey take their toll, and the typical life span is about two years.|$|E
