50|$|EU Directive 2009/24, on {{the legal}} {{protection}} of computer programs, governs reverse engineering in the European Union. The directive states:(15) The <b>unauthorised</b> <b>reproduction,</b> translation, adaptation or transformation of {{the form of the}} code in which a copy of a computer program has been made available constitutes an infringement of the exclusive rights of the author. Nevertheless, circumstances may exist when such a reproduction of the code and translation of its form are indispensable to obtain the necessary information to achieve the interoperability of an independently created program with other programs. It has therefore to be considered that, in these limited circumstances only, performance of the acts of reproduction and translation by or on behalf of a person having a right to use a copy of the program is legitimate and compatible with fair practice and must therefore be deemed not to require the authorisation of the rightholder. An objective of this exception is to make it possible to connect all components of a computer system, including those of different manufacturers, so that they can work together. Such an exception to the author's exclusive rights may not be used in a way which prejudices the legitimate interests of the rightholder or which conflicts with a normal exploitation of the program.|$|E
40|$|Video game {{source code}} attracts {{copyright}} protection {{as a literary}} work, which lasts in the UK for 70 years from {{the death of the}} author, or the last surviving author {{in the case of a}} joint work. However, due to corporate abandonment or technical obsolescence, many original video games remain unavailable in the marketplace. In response, some consumers have become 'prod-users', creating <b>unauthorised</b> <b>reproductions</b> of original video games using new software code. This paper analyses a dataset of 300 fangame projects to identify common features of production and distribution by fangame creators, as well as legal outcomes in cases where the original rightsholder has become aware of the unauthorised use. Multiple case study analysis provides a typology of fangame production and points the way to future empirical work to interrogate the likelihood of rightsholder objection under specific conditions such as length of market absence and potential for commercialisation...|$|R

According to Piaget, children at elementary school age have reached the second to last stage of cognitive development – the concrete-operational stage. At this stage, their reasoning will typically include only information that is explicitly provided. Concrete-operational children, for instance, are still unable to systematically verify hypotheses because they cannot yet construct novel test conditions unless these ar...|$|R

CARTOGRAPHIES {{is grounded in}} a theoretical framework which combines post-structural semiotics nd a philosophy of the body. Drawing particularly {{on the work of}} Derrida, Foucault, Deleuze, Irigaray and Benjamin, the chapters variously challenge the distinction between material reality and representation. Richard Rorty's vision of the liberal utopia, which he outlines in the introduction to his recent book, Contingency, Irony and Solidarity, is an explicit example of a narrative that is common, if submerged, in many recent adaptations of post-structuralism. The utopian pleasures of the text promise liberation from the cramping empiricism of science, the leaden labour of politics, and the dragging chains of metaphysics. Or is it a delusional escape? Rorty' book is dedicated: 'In memory of six liberals: my parents and grandparents'. This chapter dedicates itself to exploring the strange coupling of liberalism and post-structuralism.

40|$|Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved. <b>Unauthorised</b> <b>reproduction</b> prohibited. 'Heritage' {{is a term}} both {{broad and}} slippery. Beyond the literal meaning of {{property}} passed between generations, its contemporary evocations include 'inherited customs, beliefs and institutions held in common by a nation or community... [and] natural and "built" landscapes, buildings and environments held in trust for future generations' (Davison et. al. 1998, p. 308). Even this elemental definition strongly associates cultural institutions and heritage. Most cultural institutions articulate inherited customs and beliefs through a sense of heritage which, in turn, certifies their authenticity and legitimacy. Parliamentary conventions, halls of fame and honour boards, much judicial ritual, the use of uniforms, anniversary commemorations of all sorts and university degree conferring ceremonies are strong examples of such practices. At {{the same time the}} more material and codified notion of heritage as things held in trust explicitly organises the work of many cultural institutions. Open Acces...|$|E

40|$|Stephanie Trigg Scanned for the University of Melbourne ePrints Repository with {{permission}} of Oxford University Press. <b>Unauthorised</b> <b>reproduction</b> prohibited. The poetry of Gwen Harwood is famously passionate and sensual. Some readers {{have sought to}} interpret the dramatic situations of her poems as autobiographical narratives. Conversely, when these scenarios seem too suggestive, Harwood's more personal poems are sometimes allegorised into safer, more neutral statements about art and poetics. In this lively book Stephanie Trigg argues that greater attention to Gwen Harwood's ability to impersonate or improvise a range of voices can liberate the reader from {{the tyranny of the}} biographical equation. Trigg pays tribute to the passion and eroticism of Harwood's love poetry without seeking to probe the more private mysteries of its composition. In doing so, she posits a new way of reading one of Australia's finest poets. Harwood's fascination with the nature of art is also taken up in a study of her affiliations with poetic tradition. These relations are never straightforward, and this book suggests that feminist literary theory can help us read Harwood's complex, dynamic relations with the poetry of the past. Its conclusions will surprise many readers. Open Acces...|$|E

40|$|Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved. <b>Unauthorised</b> <b>reproduction</b> prohibited. As a {{collection}} of British colonies and then a nation, Australia came into existence {{as a product of}} both colonialism and modernity; proud of its fancied youth and eager for the fruits of civilisation, enamoured with progress yet yearning for tradition. Historical accounts of Australia have equally been products of colonialism and modernity. More often than not, the mission of history has been to remember the triumph of colonising a continent and forming a modern nation state with destiny on its side. While the historical legacies of colonialism and modernity remain palpable, many of the dreams of colonialism and modernity lie in ruins. This is a book from these 'ruins' {{in the sense that it}} discusses both the colonial past of former colonies and the colonising of indigenous people in Australia. But ruins are never simply gone or in the past; ruins are enduring traces; spaces of romantic fancies and forgetfulness where social memories imagine the persistence of time in records of destruction. Thus this book is about the past in the present, it is written from within contemporary cultures of history. It moves from Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal accounts of Captain Cook, jumps to the installation of history in museums and school curricula, glides through the historiography of archetypal historical events. This is a book with strong hopes for history and social memory. My interest is not in hammering home the constructedness of history, nor in the important task of diversifying and proliferating accounts of neglected historical actors but in thinking historically about existing social memory. It is a gesture towards learning to inhabit landscapes of memory which are, in part, landscapes littered with ruins; some archaic and others nightmarish, some quaint simulations and others desperate echoes. I imagine such a landscape of memories not as homeless place for lost souls but a ground from which new flights of historical imagination might depart and to which they might return, differently.
