5|$|The remnant trough {{proceeded}} northwestward {{into the}} Bahamas, where the NHC assessed a high chance of redevelopment based on relenting <b>upper</b> <b>wind</b> shear. Over {{the next couple}} of days, it moved over the Bahamas and proceeded east of southern Florida. Late on August6, the trough developed a new center of circulation and regenerated into a weak tropical depression by 1800UTC near Grand Bahama. Emily briefly reattained tropical storm strength six hours later, although it once again dissipated to a remnant low the next day owing to increasing wind shear. The low took on an accelerated east-northeastward motion, bypassing Bermuda before heading eastward over the open Atlantic. It briefly retained a broad area of gale-force winds with deep convection, which prompted the NHC to remonitor the system. The combination of strong wind shear and its rapid forward speed inhibited significant development, and the remnant dissipated around 1200UTC on August11, about 980mi (1,565km) west of the Azores.|$|E
5|$|With a {{relatively}} dry environment along its projected path, Emily {{was expected to}} strengthen only gradually until its predicted passage through the Greater Antilles. For several hours into August2, the cyclone fluctuated little in intensity and organization as it developed banding features. Emily's appearance later improved on satellite images, and it developed a ragged central dense overcast; the NHC estimated that the storm had reached its peak sustained winds of 50mph (80km/h) by 0000UTC on August3. Nevertheless, reconnaissance revealed that its circulation remained poorly organized, and at the time, several forecast models even supported dissipation prior to landfall in Hispaniola. An increase in <b>upper</b> <b>wind</b> shear removed the deepest convection from the circulation center, and it would remain so {{for the rest of}} the storm's duration. On August4, the cloud pattern and convective banding became better organized near the center as the upper outflow over the cyclone expanded. Emily proceeded to track just south of the Dominican Republic, where its weak circulation became increasingly disrupted due to the adjacent high terrain and increasing vertical wind shear. The cyclone accelerated over Hispaniola and degenerated into an open trough around 2100UTC that day.|$|E

40|$|NASAs LSP {{customers}} {{and the future}} SLS program rely on observations of upper-level winds for steering, loads, and trajectory calculations for the launch vehicles flight. On the day of launch, the 45 th Weather Squadron (45 WS) Launch Weather Officers (LWOs) monitor the upper-level winds and provide forecasts to the launch team via the AMU-developed LSP <b>Upper</b> <b>Winds</b> tool for launches at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. This tool displays wind speed and direction profiles from rawinsondes released during launch operations, the 45 th Space Wing 915 -MHz Doppler Radar Wind Profilers (DRWPs) and KSC 50 -MHz DRWP, and output from numerical weather prediction models. The goal of this task was to splice the wind speed and direction profiles from the 45 th Space Wing (45 SW) 915 -MHz Doppler radar Wind Profilers (DRWPs) and KSC 50 -MHz DRWP at altitudes where the wind profiles overlap to create a smooth profile. In {{the first version of}} the LSP <b>Upper</b> <b>Winds</b> tool, the top of the 915 -MHz DRWP wind profile and the bottom of the 50 -MHz DRWP were not spliced, sometimes creating a discontinuity in the profile. The Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) Natural Environments Branch (NE) created algorithms to splice the wind profiles from the two sensors to generate an archive of vertically complete wind profiles for the SLS program. The AMU worked with MSFC NE personnel to implement these algorithms in the LSP <b>Upper</b> <b>Winds</b> tool to provide a continuous spliced wind profile. The AMU transitioned the MSFC NE algorithms to interpolate and fill data gaps in the data, implement a Gaussian weighting function to produce 50 -m altitude intervals in each sensor, and splice the data together from both DRWPs. They did so by porting the MSFC NE code written with MATLAB software into Microsoft Excel Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). After testing the new algorithms in stand-alone VBA modules, the AMU replaced the existing VBA code in the LSP <b>Upper</b> <b>Winds</b> tool with the new algorithms. They then tested the code in the LSP <b>Upper</b> <b>Winds</b> tool with archived data. The tool will be delivered to the 45 WS after the 50 -MHz DRWP upgrade is complete and the tool is tested with real-time data. The 50 -MHz DRWP upgrade is expected to be finished in October 2014...|$|R

50|$|Helicoverpa zea is a seasonal, nocturnal migrant, {{and adults}} disperse, weather permitting, {{when there are}} poor {{reproductive}} conditions. In short-range dispersal, the moths move within the crop and low over the foliage. This type of dispersal is mostly independent of wind currents. Long-range dispersal involves adults flying up to 10 meters above the ground and moving downwind from crop to crop. Migratory flights occur up to 1-2 km above the ground and can last for hours. Migration of 400 km is common for such flights as moths are carried downwind. Helicoverpa zea caterpillars are usually intercepted on produce transported by air-freight transportation. Most activity is restricted to the night-time.
