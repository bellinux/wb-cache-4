Focal mechanism solution determined by F-net shows that this event has a down-dip extension focal mechanism and aftershock activity of this event is very low. Observed displacement waveforms indicate rupture propagates on the east-dipping nodal plane. To investigate source process of this event, inversion of strong motion waveforms is carried out. Result shows complex rupture propagation during this earthquake. Largest slip area is located near the hypocenter. Snapshots show rupture propagates to the right <b>upper</b> <b>direction</b> on the fault plane at first and change to the left <b>upper</b> <b>direction</b> after few seconds. Based on inversion result, the characterized source models of 2006 event are constructed. In this study source models with one and two asperities are proposed. Simulations using the empirical Green's function method suggest that the source model with two asperities is preferable but detail rupture process of this event is much more complex...|$|E

30|$|An antipredator defence in {{the citrus}} red mite Panonychus citri, {{which does not}} produce {{protective}} webs, was examined experimentally. P. citri adult females lie down on citrus leaf surfaces with their dorsal setae (hair) directed in all <b>upper</b> <b>directions.</b> They seldom move in response to physical stimuli. Compared to normal lying females, both manipulated non-lying females and hair-removed females suffered higher predation by predatory mites. A predator approaching the body surface of a lying female inevitably created elasticity with a confronting seta, which eventually repelled the predator away from the female. These observations indicated that lying down with protective setae functions as an antipredator defence in P. citri females. This inflexible defence could also explain why the mite rarely runs away, {{even when it is}} consumed together with host plant leaves (via coincidental intraguild predation) by gigantic swallowtail caterpillars, against which protective setae are totally ineffective.|$|R

40|$|Kellogg (1961), {{suggested}} that transport of atomic oxygen {{from the summer}} into the winter hemisphere and subsequent release of energy by three body recombination, O+O+N 2 yields O 2 +N 2 +E, may contribute significantly to the so-called mesopause temperature anomaly. Earlier model calculations have shown that Kellogg's mechanism produces about a 10 -percent increase in the temperature from summer to winter at 90 km. This process, however, is partly compensated by differential heating from absorption of UV radiation associated with dissociation of O 2. In the auroral region of the thermosphere, there is a steady energy dissipation by Joule heating causing a redistribution and depletion of atomic oxygen due to wind-induced diffusion. With the removal of O, latent chemical energy normally released by three body recombination is also removed, {{and the result is}} that the temperature decreases by almost 2 percent near 90 km.
