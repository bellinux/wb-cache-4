The 824th was prepared for conversion to the new equipment by early March, but this was delayed in order to support the 100th Division's attack on Bitche as part of Operation <b>Undertone</b> from 15–19 March.|$|E
5|$|In April, {{the band}} began demoing material, {{and said they}} were aiming to release a new album later in the year. In August, the band {{announced}} they would be recording in a few weeks' time, and were aiming for a spring 2011 release. After some shows in the summer, the band began recording in October. Eric Valentine produced the sessions at Barefoot Recording in Hollywood, California. Valentine also engineered the sessions with assistance from Cian Riordan. The band used <b>Undertone</b> Audio Consoles during recording. At the start of recording, the group had 18 songs. They whittled this number down little by little, and wrote additional songs at Robert Lang Studios in Seattle, Washington. The drums tracks were completed in early October.|$|E
5|$|The basic plot of Anbe Sivam bears {{resemblance}} to the 1987 road film, Planes, Trains and Automobiles directed by John Hughes, which starred Steve Martin and John Candy in the lead roles. Kamal and Madhavan reprise the roles played by Candy and Martin in that film, respectively. The portrait painted by Nallasivam {{on the walls of}} Padayatchi's house is inspired by the Mexican painter Diego Rivera's fresco, Man at the Crossroads. The painting shows Nallasivam posing as Padayatchi's deity Lord Shiva, the number 910 indicating the salary Padayatchi pays to his factory's workers, and the communism symbol. Srinivasa Ramanujam, writing for The Times of India in 2008, noted that the religious <b>undertone</b> in the film was similar to that of Rajinikanth's Baba (2002).|$|E

5|$|No prototypes for the {{painting}} are known in Sweden, and while {{the painting}} is occasionally associated with the Danube school, much about its stylistic and iconographic history remains to be investigated. A possible stylistic prototype is the illustrated Bible of Erhard Altdorfer (brother of the more famous Albrecht Altdorfer). Begun in 1530, it {{was inspired by the}} works of Cranach and Dürer, but also renewed the genre by combining commonplace details with an <b>undertone</b> of approaching disaster. In particular, Altdorfer's apocalyptic illustrations for the Revelation to John deliver an evangelic message {{similar to that of the}} Vädersolstavlan. Historical documents show that Olaus Petri, who commissioned the painting, combined biblical quotations related to the Apocalypse with the painting hanging in the church. Copies of Erhard Altdorfer's apocalyptic woodcuts may have been available in Stockholm through the German merchant Gorius Holste who lived by Järntorget square and who was a friend of both Petri and Martin Luther.|$|E
5|$|Italian pop rock has {{produced}} major stars like Zucchero, and {{has resulted in}} many top hits. The industry media, especially television, are important vehicles for such music; the television show Sabato Sera is characteristic. Italy was {{at the forefront of}} the progressive rock movement of the 1970s, a style that primarily developed in Europe but also gained audiences elsewhere in the world. It is sometimes considered a separate genre, Italian progressive rock. Italian bands such as The Trip, Area, Premiata Forneria Marconi (PFM), Arti e Mestieri, Banco del Mutuo Soccorso, New Trolls, Goblin, Osanna, Saint Just and Le Orme incorporated a mix of symphonic rock and Italian folk music and were popular throughout Europe and the United States as well. Other progressive bands such as Perigeo, Balletto di Bronzo, Museo Rosenbach, Rovescio della Medaglia, Biglietto per l'Inferno or Alphataurus remained little known, but their albums are today considered classics by collectors. A few avant-garde rock bands or artists (Area, Picchio dal Pozzo, Opus Avantra, Stormy Six, Saint Just, Giovanni Lindo Ferretti) gained notoriety for their innovative sound. Progressive rock concerts in Italy tended to have a strong political <b>undertone</b> and an energetic atmosphere.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Undertones</b> are a punk rock/new wave band {{formed in}} Derry, Northern Ireland, in 1974. From 1975 to 1983, the <b>Undertones</b> {{consisted}} of Feargal Sharkey (vocals), John O'Neill (rhythm guitar, vocals), Damian O'Neill (lead guitar, vocals), Michael Bradley (bass, vocals) and Billy Doherty (drums). Much {{of the earlier}} <b>Undertones</b> material drew influence from punk rock and new wave; the <b>Undertones</b> also incorporated elements of rock, glam rock and post-punk into material released after 1979, before citing soul and Motown as the influence for the material released upon their final album. The <b>Undertones</b> released thirteen singles and four studio albums between 1978 and 1983 before Sharkey announced his intention to leave the band in May 1983, citing musical differences {{as the reason for}} the break up.|$|R

25|$|The film {{consists}} of a fluent succession of fifty short sketches, most with a tragicomic <b>undertone.</b> The cast is mostly non-professional, and alienating techniques are employed such as presenting the characters in grim make-up and having them talk directly to camera.

The film won the Silver Hugo Award for Best Direction at the 2007 Chicago International Film Festival and has received critical acclaim.|$|E

She wrote that life is a process of constant change—there are departures for some and arrivals for others—and the process allows us to grow and persevere.|$|E
25|$|Red Faction is {{a series}} of shooter video games {{developed}} by Volition and is owned by THQ Nordic. Originating in 2001, the Red Faction games have spanned Microsoft Windows, macOS and many consoles, including the PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The Red Faction series has been heavy on its thematic undertones throughout the games. One of the more outstanding themes of the series is a revolutionary socialist <b>undertone.</b> From the miners rebellion featured (in separate ways) in Red Faction and Red Faction: Guerrilla, to the overthrown monarchy of Red Faction II, this has been a central theme since the games' inception in 2001.|$|E
25|$|In an {{international}} press meeting, the Flemish nationalist party Vlaams Belang {{said that the}} formation crisis {{was an example of}} Belgium's failure to function as a state and that {{the time had come to}} declare Flemish independence. On September 1, the Flemish newspaper De Standaard devoted an issue to the question of whether a Flemish secession was realistic and viable. On September 2, during De Gordel, an annual Flemish cycling event in the periphery of Brussels with a strong political <b>undertone,</b> Eric Van Rompuy (member of the CD and the brother of explorateur Herman) and Bart De Wever (N-VA) emphasized that this should be the last De Gordel in which the problems surrounding the BHV were not solved. Flemish minister Geert Bourgeois (N-VA) also stated that the Flemish majority in the newly elected parliament should urgently solve the problem unilaterally - i.e. without the consent of the French speaking parties and thus without any offers. Other politicians, such as Flemish minister-president Kris Peeters (CD) and federal minister of Internal Affairs Patrick Dewael (Open VLD) participated in the event, but did not comment on BHV. Prominent absentees were Yves Leterme and Guy Verhofstadt.|$|E

25|$|While Orthodox protests to Jacobson's {{initiatives}} were scant, {{dozens of}} rabbis throughout Europe united {{to ban the}} Hamburg Temple. Its leaders attempted to justify themselves based on canonical sources, being still attached to old modes of thought. They had the grudging support of one rabbi, Aaron Chorin of Arad (and even he never acceded to the abrogation of the Messianic doctrine). The massive Orthodox reaction halted the advance of the new trend, confining it to the port city for the next twenty years. Although many synagogues introduced mild aesthetic modifications as the process of acculturation spread throughout Central Europe, synchronized with the breakdown of traditional society and growing religious laxity, those were carefully crafted in order to assuage conservative elements – albeit the latter often opposed them anyhow; vernacular sermons or secular education for rabbis were much resisted – and lacked a serious ideological <b>undertone.</b> One {{of the first to}} adopt such was Hamburg's own Orthodox community under the newly appointed Rabbi Isaac Bernays. The far less strict but still traditional Isaac Noah Mannheimer of the Vienna Stadttempel and Michael Sachs in Prague, who both significantly altered custom but wholly avoided dogmatic issues or overt injury to Jewish Law, set the pace for most of Europe.|$|E
25|$|The {{novel as}} a genre of {{literature}} arrived in Tamil {{in the third}} quarter of the 19th century, more than a century after it became popular with English writers. Its emergence was perhaps facilitated by the growing population of Tamils with a western education and exposure to popular English fiction. Mayavaram Vedanayagam Pillai wrote the first Tamil novel Prathapa Mudaliar Charithram in 1879. This was a romance with an assortment of fables, folk tales and even Greek and Roman stories, written with the entertainment of the reader as the principal motive. It was followed by Kamalambal Charitram by B.R. Rajam Iyer in 1893 and Padmavathi Charitram by A. Madhaviah in 1898. These two portray the life of Brahmins in 19th century rural Tamil Nadu, capturing their customs and habits, beliefs and rituals. Although it was primarily a powerful narration of the common man's life in a realistic style spiced with natural humour, Rajam Iyer's novel has a spiritual and philosophical <b>undertone.</b> Madhaviah tells the story in a more realistic way with a searching criticism of the upper caste society, particularly the sexual exploitation of girls by older men.Mr.D.Jayakanthan - the real trend setter in modern-day Tamil novels.He has not only enriched the high traditions of literary traditions of Tamil language but has also made outstanding contribution towards the shaping of Indian literature. His literature presents a deep and sensitive understanding of complex human nature and is an authentic and vivid index of Indian reality.
