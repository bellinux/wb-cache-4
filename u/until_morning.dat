5|$|Montcalm, before {{agreeing to}} these terms, {{tried to make}} sure that his Indian allies {{understood}} them, and that the chiefs would undertake to restrain their men. This process was complicated by the diversity within the Indian camp, which included some warriors who spoke languages not understood by any European present. The British garrison was then evacuated from the fort to the entrenched camp, and Monro was quartered in the French camp. The Indians then entered the fort and plundered it, butchering some of the wounded and sick that the British had left behind. The French guards posted around the entrenched camp were only somewhat successful at keeping the Indians out of that area, and it took much effort to prevent plunder and scalping there. Montcalm and Monro initially planned to march the prisoners south the following morning, but after seeing the Indian bloodlust, decided to attempt the march that night. When the Indians became aware that the British were getting ready to move, a large number of them massed around the camp, causing the leaders to call off the march <b>until</b> <b>morning.</b>|$|E
5|$|Patrick {{gets on the}} bus to go {{home but}} accidentally leaves SpongeBob behind. After several {{unsuccessful}} attempts {{to get on the}} bus, SpongeBob heads to a bus station and waits in a very long line. By the time he reaches the front, he finds out that the next bus leaves in 5 seconds; he misses it, then learns that it was the last one and he is stuck there <b>until</b> <b>morning.</b> He becomes frightened by a raspberry sound coming from off in the distance, and he dashes back to the cliff in terror. Finally, the raspberry sound's maker is revealed to be a friendly-looking anglerfish creature, who has retrieved SpongeBob's glove balloon. The creature blows up the balloon and ties it to SpongeBob's wrist, which allows him to rise up the cliff and float back to Bikini Bottom. The episode ends with Patrick {{on his way back to}} Rock Bottom, thinking SpongeBob is still there.|$|E
5|$|Refusing to {{surrender}} until all options had been exhausted, Willoughby dispatched boats to Sirius, asking Pym if {{he believed it}} would be practical to send boats to tow Nereide out of range. Pym replied that with the boats engaged in attempting to tow Sirius and Magicienne off the reef {{it was not possible}} to deploy them under fire to tow Nereide. Pym also suggested that Willoughby disembark his men and set fire to his ship in the hope that the flames would spread to the French ships clustered on shore. Willoughby refused this suggestion as it was not practical to disembark the dozens of wounded men aboard Nereide in the growing darkness and refused to personally abandon his men when Pym ordered him to transfer to Sirius. At 11:00 pm, Willoughby ordered a boat to row to Bellone and notify the French commander that he had surrendered. However, Willoughby's boat had been holed by shot and was unable to make the short journey. The message was instead conveyed by French prisoners from Nereide who had dived overboard and reached the shore during the night. Recalling the false flags used on 20 August, Bouvet resolved to wait <b>until</b> <b>morning</b> before accepting the surrender.|$|E

5|$|Rosebeary, flying Cobra Blue Ghost 28, {{called a}} Mayday but {{was able to}} safely exit the area and landed his {{severely}} damaged helicopter. His aircraft was totaled. He and Gunner Warrant Officer Charles Gorski were {{picked up by a}} HH-53C helicopter (Jolly Green 67), without incident. Rosebeary warned other aircraft against crossing the river. When Morse in Sandy 07 learned that the quick-snatch had failed, he and his wingman Sandy 08 broke off engaging the North Vietnamese and returned to Da Nang. Both Sandys were found to be so damaged they would take several days to repair. At 9:00p.m., Nail 59, {{a new version of the}} OV-10A Bronco aircraft equipped with the Pave Nail LORAN radar piloted by Gary Ferentchak, took over FAC duties. The SAR efforts were suspended for the night and the U.S. and ARVN forces remained unaware of the true strength of the NVA offensive. Advised by the FAC to remain in place, Hambleton moved to a safer spot in the jungle and dug a hole to hide in <b>until</b> <b>morning.</b> During the night, Nail 59 and King 27, an HC-130 commanded by Maj. Dennis Constant, stayed. They suddenly found themselves painted by Fan Song radar and narrowly missed getting shot down as well. At 53 years old, Hambleton was not a prime candidate to survive the cold, wet weather conditions.|$|E

25|$|The first {{ability is}} a hormone cycle {{that reduces the}} body's urine production. At about sunset each day, the body {{releases}} a minute burst of antidiuretic hormone (also known as arginine vasopressin or AVP). This hormone burst reduces the kidney's urine output well into the night so that the bladder does not get full <b>until</b> <b>morning.</b> This hormone cycle is not present at birth. Many children develop it {{between the ages of}} two and six years old, others between six and the end of puberty, and some not at all.|$|E

25|$|Caught by {{unexpected}} currents {{the four}} folboats were pushed south of their landing area and came ashore amid a surf break.

Thus alerted, the island became a hunting ground, with almost 1,000 Japanese searching for the patrol. Attempts to communicate by radio with the HDML patrol boat failed, as their radios had been swamped and the batteries ruined.|$|E
25|$|Skirmishing {{with and}} {{reacting}} to feints from Union patrols from the 6th Pennsylvania Cavalry under Colonel Charles L.

Pickett decided because of the late hour {{and the absence of}} the other cavalry divisions to wait <b>until</b> <b>morning</b> to move his tired men against Sheridan at Five Forks. Pickett did send William R. Terry's and Montgomery Corse's brigades to an advanced position south of Five Forks to guard against surprise attack. Some of Devin's men skirmished with the advanced infantry brigades before the Confederates were able to settle into their positions. By 9:45p.m., Pickett's force was deployed along the White Oak Road.|$|E

25|$|It {{is likely}} {{that in the early}} hours of 22 December the Ceaușescus made their second mistake. Instead of fleeing the city under cover of night, they decided to wait <b>until</b> <b>morning</b> to leave. Ceaușescu must have thought that his desperate {{attempts}} to crush the protests had succeeded, because he apparently called another meeting for the next morning. However, before 07:00, his wife Elena received the news that large columns of workers from many industrial platforms (large communist-era factories or groups of factories concentrated into industrial zones) were heading towards city centre of Bucharest to join the protests. The police barricades that were meant to block access to Piața Universității (University Square) and Palace Square proved useless. By 09:30 University Square was jammed with protesters. Security forces (army, police and others) re-entered the area, only to join with the protesters.|$|E
25|$|When {{the captain}} made the {{decision}} to evacuate the chief engineer, who was suffering from gastroenteritis, the chief steward and two members of the deck crew, MRCC Turku gave the evacuation mission to Finnish Border Guard Eurocopter AS332 Super Puma OH-HVF which was returning from previous mission and still had more than two hours of remaining flight time. MRCC Göteborg authorized the Finnish helicopter to enter Swedish airspace as the combination was six miles into the Swedish territorial waters. The helicopter arrived and began lifting the crew members from the rear part of the cargo hold at around 16:50, a task that was very difficult due to pitching and rolling of the combination. The crew was brought to Mariehamn where they were supposed to spend the night and then return to the ship in the morning. They didn't learn <b>until</b> <b>morning</b> that the combination had sunk.|$|E

25|$|The {{failure of}} the British {{artillery}} support to arrive {{early in the day}} meant that Le Muy remained in enemy hands, but the British secured the high ground along both sides of the Argens River east of Le Muy, and also the high ground to the north, establishing road blocks and patrols, while the 517th PRCT occupied the hills overlooking the Toulon-Saint-Raphaël corridor in the vicinity of Les Arcs, five miles west of Le Muy, and the 509th dug in on the high ground south of Les Muy with eleven 75mm guns in position overlooking the town. The first contact with ground forces was made that evening about 20:30 when troops of the 509th PIB met a patrol from the U.S. 45th Division's reconnaissance troop. An attempt to capture Le Muy was mounted by the 550th GIB after dark, but the attack failed and the battalion withdrew to wait <b>until</b> <b>morning.</b> Except for the seizure of the town, the 1ABTF completed its D-Day objectives, establishing a strong blocking position along the Argens Valley and isolating the beachhead. The scattered parachute drop did not appreciably affect the operation and may have helped confuse the Germans as to the objectives of both the airborne and amphibious assaults.|$|E
