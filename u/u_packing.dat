40|$|OBJECTIVE: This article {{describes}} the important clinical events and decisions surrounding the reconstruction/unpacking portion of the staged celiotomy for trauma. METHODS: Of 13, 817 consecutive trauma admissions, 1175 received trauma celiotomies. Of these, 107 patients (9. 1 %) underwent staged celiotomy with abdominal packing. The authors examined medical records to identify and characterize: (1) indications and timing of reconstruction, (2) criteria for emergency return {{to the operating room}}, (3) complications after reconstruction, and (4) abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients (54. 2 %) survived to reconstruction, 43 (74. 1 %) survived to discharge; 9 patients (15. 5 %) were returned to the operating room for bleeding; 13 patients required multiple packing procedures. There were 117 complications; 8 patients had positive blood cultures, abdominal abscesses developed in 6 patients, and ACS developed in 16 patients. CONCLUSIONS: 1. Reconstruction should occur after temperature, coagulopathy, and acidosis are corrected, usually within 36 hours after the damage control procedure. 2. Emergent reoperation should occur in any normothermic patient with unabated bleeding (greater than 2 <b>U</b> <b>packed</b> cells/hr). 3. ACS occurs in 15 % of patients and is characterized by high peak inspiratory pressure, CO 2 retention, and oliguria. Lethal reperfusion syndrome is common but preventable...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} the monitoring of an unsuccessful case of methotrexate treatment of cervical pregnancy. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: University hospital. PATIENT(S) : A 27 -year-old woman, gravida 3, para 1, with a vital cervical pregnancy. INTERVENTION(S) : Feticide and methotrexate administered both locally and systemically. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : Treatment success, defined as {{elimination of the}} cervical pregnancy with preservation of the uterus. RESULT(S) : Despite reassuringly declining serum hCG concentrations, several episodes of severe vaginal bleeding demanded transfusions of 19 <b>U</b> of <b>packed</b> cells, two angiographic embolizations that were complicated by septicemia, and a balloon catheter tamponade followed by a third angiographic embolization.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{randomized}} controlled trials {{support the use}} of intensive medical and invasive therapies for non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS), major bleeding is a serious treatment complication. We sought to determine the temporal trend of in-hospital major bleeding among patients with NSTE-ACS, in relation to the evolving management pattern. METHODS: We identified 14 111 NSTE-ACS patients enrolled in 4 successive, prospective, multicenter registries (ACS I, 1999 - 2001; ACS II, 2002 - 2003; GRACE, 2004 - 2007; and CANRACE, 2008) in Canada between 1999 and 2008. We collected data on patient characteristics, use of cardiac medications and procedures on standardized case report forms. In all registries, major bleeding was defined a priori as life threatening or fatal bleeding, bleeding requiring transfusion of 3 ̆e/= 2 <b>U</b> of <b>packed</b> red cells, or resulting in an absolute decrease in hemoglobin of 3 ̆e 30 g/L.

40|$|Background—Hemorrhage is {{associated}} with ischemic complications in cardiac patients. The nature of this relationship in surgical patients is unknown. Methods and Results—We examined the association between major perioperative hemorrhage and stroke or myocardial infarction among adults who underwent surgery from 2005 through 2009 at centers participating in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program. We excluded patients with emergent, trauma-related, transplantation, cardiac, or neurological operations. Major hemorrhage was defined as bleeding necessitating transfusion of 4 <b>U</b> of <b>packed</b> red blood cells or whole blood. Stroke was defined as focal brain dysfunction lasting 24 hours from a vascular cause. A diagnosis of myocardial infarction required new ECG Q waves. Outcomes were assessed from surgery until 30 days afterward. Among 651 775 patients who underwent surgery, 5233 (0. 80 %) experienced major hemorrhage, 1575 (0. 24 %) developed Q-wave myocardial infarction, and 1321 (0. 20 %) suffered a stroke. In Cox proportional hazards analyses controlling for vascular risk factors, illness severity, and type of surgery, hemorrhage was independently associated with subsequent stroke (hazard ratio, 2. 5; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 9 – 3. 3) and subsequent Q-wave myocardial infarction (hazard ratio, 2. 7; 95 % confidence interval, 2. 1 – 3. 4).

40|$|PURPOSE: Salvage cystoprostatectomy {{has evolved}} {{as a safe}} and {{potentially}} curative treatment option for patients with radiation recurrent bladder cancer. Although orthotopic bladder replacement remains the preferred form of urinary diversion, there is minimal information about its role in salvage cystectomy series. We describe our limited experience in this regard. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We evaluated the operative characteristics and outcome of two patients with muscle invasive transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the urinary bladder after failed high-dose radiation therapy (mean 6, 490 cGy). Both patients underwent salvage cystoprostatectomy with Studer-type ileal neobladder reconstruction. Existing literature on the topic is reviewed. RESULTS: Final histopathology showed pT 3 N 0 M 0 TCC urinary bladder with no recent evidence of tumor recurrence. There was no mortality or major perioperative complication. Mean surgery time was 590 minutes, and mean blood loss was 1, 600 mL, with 3. 5 <b>U</b> of <b>packed</b> cell transfusion per patient. Mean length of stay was 15 days. Postoperative complications included urinary tract infection in both cases. Prolonged urinary leakage, metabolic derangements, and loose stools were seen in one case.

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate laboratory data and the clinical outcome of fibrinogen administration in patients suffering from severe hemorrhage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study over a 3 -year observation period of consecutive patients who received a single dose of fibrinogen concentrate but not recombinant factor VIIa as part of their treatment of severe hemorrhage, defined as > 6 <b>U</b> of <b>packed</b> red blood cells (PRBCs). RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were included, most of them suffering from severe hemorrhage following open heart surgery (68 %). After a median fibrinogen dose of 2 g (range 1 - 6 g), an absolute increase in the plasma fibrinogen concentration of 0. 6 g/l was observed (P< 0. 001). The activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) decreased significantly (P< 0. 001), from 52 to 43 s and the prothrombin time (PT) decreased from 20 to 17 s, respectively. The transfusion requirement for PRBCs decreased from 6 to 3 U (P< 0. 01) in the 24 h after fibrinogen administration, but fresh-frozen plasma and platelet concentrate transfusions did not change significantly.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveIn {{an effort}} to {{minimize}} transfusions in patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting operations after recent clopidogrel exposure, we studied laboratory tests predictive of platelet dysfunction and used a strict algorithm-driven treatment of bleeding. MethodsForty-five patients receiving clopidogrel within 6 days of the operation and 45 control subjects were studied. Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, platelet count, and platelet function test results were measured before heparinization, after protamine administration, and then every 2 hours. No transfusions were administered unless a patient met both laboratory and clinical criteria. ResultsAlgorithm-driven treatment of bleeding significantly reduced the mean units of all blood components transfused by about one third, as shown by comparison with current control and historical data. Compared with current control subjects, clopidogrel recipients required significantly more transfusions of platelets (9. 0 ± 1. 7 vs 1. 2 ± 0. 5 U; P <. 0001) and {{packed red blood cells}} (4. 3 ± 0. 6 vs 2. 3 ± 0. 5 U; P =. 01) and required longer periods of controlled ventilation (12. 4 ± 1. 3 vs 8. 6 ± 0. 8 hours; P =. 02). Preoperative platelet dysfunction before heparin administration for cardiopulmonary bypass, as measured by using adenosine diphosphate aggregometry (response < 40 %), predicted all but 1 case of severe coagulopathy requiring multiple transfusions (16. 6 ± 2. 8 U of platelets and 5. 8 ± 1. 0 <b>U</b> of <b>packed</b> red blood cells). ConclusionsA strict transfusion algorithm can reduce the transfusion requirement for all blood components. Preheparin testing of platelet function with adenosine diphosphate aggregometry can identify patients at highest risk for perioperative bleeding and transfusions and might further reduce the perioperative transfusion requirement...|$|R

The toyline featured many re-designed and updated action figures from the original action figure line from the 1980s; but it also included characters from She-Ra Princess of Power (Adora, Madame Razz, Scorpia, Shadow Weaver and others), the New Adventures of He-Man (Mara, Crita and more) and the Mike Young Productions series from 2002 (Faceless One, Chief Carnivus, King Chooblah, Ceratus and others). As the line progressed, characters from all versions of MOTU lore were included from such things such as prototypes and concept art (He-Ro, Eldor, Demo-Man, Gygor, Vykor and others), box art from vehicles and model kits (Sky High and the Fighting Foe Men), mini-comics (The Goddess, Geldor and Procrustus), and other books, comics and media (Despara, Scrollos, Strobo, Goat-Man and more). There were also newly created figures, exclusive to the Classics toyline, such as Draego-Man, Cy-Chop, Castle Grayskullman and others. In February 2010, the figures of He-Man and Skeletor were available as Toys R <b>Us</b> exclusives <b>packed</b> in two-packs with Superman and Lex Luthor respectively, from Mattel's DC Universe Classics action figure line; with this dual line expanded to include two-packs featuring Aquaman/Mer-Man, Hawkman/Stratos, Bizarro/Faker, Supergirl/She-Ra, and finally Green Lantern/Zodac.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to examine changes in employment and wage patterns, industrial restructuring, and foreign competition that affect job opportunities of recent immigrants to the nonmetropolitan Midwest, especially to Iowa. The food and kindred products industry which includes meat packing and poultry slaughtering and processing is a significant employer of recent immigrants. The meat packing industry has a long history of employing immigrants, especially Irish and Polish immigrants during the first half of the 20 th century. <b>U.</b> S. meat <b>packing</b> has undergone significant technical change and geographical relocation during the past 25 years. During 1945 to 1968, unions gained considerable wage advantage for hourly meat packing workers relative to other manufacturing workers. These relatively high wage rates of the unionized packing house workers were undoubtedly one of the contributing factors to these changes. The technical changes that occurred were somewhat unusual in that technical advances replaced a major component of skilled labor, the meat cutters, in meat packing and opened packing house employment again to less skilled workers, including recent immigrants. Hispanics, Asians, and Sudanese are groups represented in the Midwest...|$|R
