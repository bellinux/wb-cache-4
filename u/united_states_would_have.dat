5|$|This eventuality was foreseen. At the three-power Bermuda Conference with President Dwight D. Eisenhower in December 1953, the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, {{suggested}} that the United States allow Britain {{to have access to}} American nuclear weapons to make up the shortfall. There were several technical and legal issues. For American bombs to be carried in British aircraft, the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to disclose their weights and dimensions, while their delivery would require data concerning their ballistics. The release of such information was restricted by the McMahon Act. Further down the line, there would also be issues of custody, security and targeting.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Garfield {{administration}} assumed office in 1881, the Navy's condition had deteriorated still further. A review conducted {{on behalf of the}} new Secretary of the Navy, William H. Hunt, found that of 140 vessels on the Navy's active list, only 52 were in an operational state, of which a mere 17 were iron-hulled ships, including 14 aging Civil War era ironclads. Hunt recognized the necessity of modernizing the Navy, and set up an informal advisory board to make recommendations. Also to be expected, morale was considerably down; officers and sailors in foreign ports were all too aware that their old wooden ships would not survive long in the event of war. The limitations of the monitor type effectively prevented the United States from projecting power overseas, and until the 1890s the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> come off badly in a conflict with even Spain or the Latin American powers.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{have varied}} interpretations of Marshall's vice presidency. Claire Suddath rated Marshall {{as one of}} the worst vice presidents in American history in a 2008 Time {{magazine}} article. Samuel Eliot Morison wrote that had Marshall carried out his constitutional duties, assumed the presidency, and made the concessions necessary for the passage of the League of Nations treaty in late 1920, the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been much more involved in European affairs and could have helped prevent the rise of Adolf Hitler, which began in the following year. Morison {{and a number of other}} historians claim that Marshall's decision was an indirect cause of the Second World War. Charles Thomas, one of Marshall's biographers, wrote that although Marshall's assumption of the presidency would have made World War II much less likely, modern hypothetical speculation on the subject was unfair to Marshall, who made the correct decision in not forcibly removing Wilson from office, even temporarily.|$|E

5|$|Wickliffe {{supported}} the annexation of Texas, {{an issue that}} helped seal Clay's defeat in the 1844 presidential canvass. In 1845, President James K. Polk sent Wickliffe as an envoy on a secret mission to the Republic of Texas. Originally, his purpose was to quash British and French attempts to forestall the U.S. annexation of Texas, but he later joined Commodore Robert F. Stockton in lobbying leaders of the Republic of Texas to order their military forces across the Rio Grande into Mexico. Stockton and Wickliffe believed that if they could provoke a Texan invasion of Mexico, the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> a stronger case for annexing Texas. Ultimately, they failed in convincing the Texans to invade, but succeeded in drumming up support for annexation. Both Wickliffe's position on annexation and his willingness to carry out Polk's assignment further distanced him from the Whigs.|$|E
5|$|In late March 2012, a US {{military}} official {{stated that the}} <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to use routes through the Northern Distribution Network (NDN) for supplies to Afghanistan if Pakistan refused to reopen its supply lines. However, he conceded the expensiveness of these routes and noted that negotiations with Pakistan regarding the possibility of opening of the supply routes were ongoing. After reviewing United States-Pakistan relations and outlining what was needed to repair bilateral relations, the Pakistani parliament turned the decision of reopening the NATO supply lines over to the government in April 2012. Due to an upcoming general election in Pakistan, with widespread anti-American sentiments in the country, the Pakistani government was reluctant to reopen the lines, and postponed its decision until the United States responded positively to Pakistani demands outlined in the parliamentary recommendations, such as a US apology for the November 2011 incident, the bringing {{of those involved in}} the strike to justice, and a stop to US drone airstrikes. Talks between Pakistan and the United States failed in April 2012 after Pakistan could not get an unconditional apology from the United States for the November 2011 incident. The White House refused to apologise after Taliban attacks in Kabul and other cities in Afghanistan on 15 April 2012, which according to US military and intelligence officials came from the Haqqani network, an Afghan group working from a base in North Waziristan along the Afghanistan border in Pakistan's tribal belt. Pakistani officials said they cannot open the NATO supply routes in Afghanistan without a US apology.|$|E

25|$|The {{threat to}} federal {{government}} constituted {{a menace to}} republicanism. Without federalism, a republic {{the size of the}} <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> grave difficulty giving fair representation to the varied interests {{of the people in the}} different states. Representatives in the national capital would have to be kept responsible to their constituents at home; the Federal Farmer believed that a large number of representatives was required to ensure a high ratio of representatives to constituents and guarantee that all classes would be fairly represented.|$|E

25|$|At the three-power Bermuda Conference in December 1953, Eisenhower and Churchill {{discussed}} {{the possibility of}} the United States giving Britain access to American nuclear weapons in wartime.

25|$|World War II {{resulted}} in enormous destruction of infrastructure and populations throughout Eurasia {{with almost no}} country left unscathed. The only major industrial {{power in the world}} to emerge intact—and even greatly strengthened from an economic perspective—was the United States. As the world's greatest industrial power, and {{as one of the few}} countries physically unscathed by the war, the United States stood to gain enormously from opening the entire world to unfettered trade. The <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> a global market for its exports, and it would have unrestricted access to vital raw materials. Determined to avoid another economic catastrophe like that of the 1930s, U.S. leaders saw the creation of the postwar order as a way to ensure continuing U.S. prosperity.|$|E

25|$|At this, Siho inveigled Kouprasith into a coup, on {{the grounds}} that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to accept their new government. By early April 1964, the DNC {{consisted}} of 6,500 men and served variously as a civil police force, immigration service, national police, and military intelligence service. On the night of 18/19 April 1964, BS 33 seized Vientiane's infrastructure. They arrested Souvanna Phouma and 15 leading officials of several opposed factions such as the Royal Lao Army, Forces Armées Neutralistes, and the French Embassy. The coup force emptied the safe in the FAN's headquarters and looted Kong Le's home. Some 15 other FAN officials sought asylum from the coup in the Soviet Embassy. Overall however, the DNC policemen were successful in their coup.|$|E
25|$|Some 90% of United Kingdom exports go to metric {{countries}} (as only Liberia, Burma and the United States {{have not}} adopted the International System of Units), {{and there are}} costs to business of maintaining two production lines (one for exports to the US in US customary units, {{and the other for}} domestic sales and exports {{to the rest of the}} world in metric). These have been estimated at 3% of annual turnover by the Institute of Production Engineers, and at £1.1billion (1980) per annum by the CBI. Regardless of United Kingdom metrication, goods produced in the United Kingdom for export to the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> still been labelled in non-metric units to comply with the US Fair Packaging and Labelling Act.|$|E
25|$|An early {{milestone}} {{in the rise}} in importance of blogs came in 2002, when many bloggers focused on comments by U.S. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott. Senator Lott, at a party honoring U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond, praised Senator Thurmond by suggesting that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been better off had Thurmond been elected president. Lott's critics saw these comments as a tacit approval of racial segregation, a policy advocated by Thurmond's 1948 presidential campaign. This view was reinforced by documents and recorded interviews dug up by bloggers. (See Josh Marshall's Talking Points Memo.) Though Lott's comments were made at a public event attended by the media, no major media organizations reported on his controversial comments until after blogs broke the story. Blogging helped to create a political crisis that forced Lott to step down as majority leader.|$|E

25|$|Postwar world {{capitalism}} {{suffered from}} a huge dollar shortage. The United States was running huge balance of trade surpluses, and the U.S. reserves were immense and growing. It was necessary to reverse this flow. Even though all nations wanted to buy US exports, dollars {{had to leave the}} United States and become available for international use {{in order for them to}} do so. In other words, the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to reverse the imbalances in global wealth by running a balance of trade deficit, financed by an outflow of US reserves to other nations (a US financial account deficit). The US could run a financial deficit by either importing from, building plants in, or donating to foreign nations. Recall that speculative investment was discouraged by the Bretton Woods agreement. Importing from other nations was not appealing in the 1950s, because US technology was cutting edge at the time. So multinationals and global aid which originated from the US burgeoned.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Census Bureau view on {{the future}} of {{longevity}} is that life expectancy in the United States will be in the mid-80s by 2050 (up from 77.85 in 2006) and will top out eventually in the low 90s, barring major scientific advances that can change the rate of human aging itself, as opposed to merely treating the effects of aging as is done today. The Census Bureau also predicted that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> 5.3 million people aged over 100 in 2100. The United Nations has also made projections far out into the future, up to 2300, at which point it projects that life expectancies in most developed countries will be between 100 and 106 years and still rising, though more and more slowly than before. These projections also suggest that life expectancies in poor countries will still be less than those in rich countries in 2300, in some cases by as much as 20 years. The UN itself mentioned that gaps in life expectancy so far in the future may well not exist, especially since the exchange of technology between rich and poor countries and the industrialization and development of poor countries may cause their life expectancies to converge fully with those of rich countries long before that point, similarly to the way life expectancies between rich and poor countries have already been converging over the last 60 years as better medicine, technology, and living conditions became accessible to many people in poor countries. The UN has warned that these projections are uncertain, and cautions that any change or advancement in medical technology could invalidate such projections.|$|E
