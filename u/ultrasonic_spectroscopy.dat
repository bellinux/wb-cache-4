These results went unsubstantiated by other nondestructive evaluation (NDE) methods. To explain the results, PMC rings were further investigated with <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> (ref. 2). The <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> system utilizes a continuous-swept sine waveform as the input. After the swept sine wave traverses the material, the captured waveform is subjected to two fast Fourier transforms. The second fast Fourier transform along with equalization of the frequency spectrum, allows for evaluation of the fundamental resonant frequency.

40|$|Abstract: Traditional <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> methods (narrow pulse, {{broadband}} ultrasonics) {{have often}} fallen short in application due to limitations on bandwidth and input energy. A system for <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> {{that uses a}} swept-frequency input signal has been developed.

The spectrum can also be designed to provide uniform input energy over the selected range of frequencies. The new <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> technique {{has been used to}} quantitatively measure such diverse properties as porosity content and thickness loss in corrosion applications. It has also been successful in identifying disbonds in multiple layer structures. An overview of the technology along with application examples will be presented.

A flywheel system includes the components necessary to store and discharge energy in a rotating mass.

30|$|Insect {{damage is}} one of the most serious {{problems}} in conservation of wooden cultural heritage buildings. Because this damage is quite small in a cross section, it is difficult to detect by conventional ultrasonic techniques. In the previous study, <b>ultrasonic</b> attenuation <b>spectroscopy</b> showed a feasibility to detect this small defect. But to apply this method to real inspection, the robustness needs to be improved. For improving the robustness, this study focused on inconsistency of ultrasonic spectrum measurement. To minimize the inconsistency, Spectra-averaging pretreatment was attempted. Even though this pretreatment would provide the better robustness, it can also make a negative effect on the accuracy in the detection of small damage. Therefore, the influence of the pretreatment on the prediction was investigated in this study. By <b>ultrasonic</b> attenuation <b>spectroscopy,</b> the number of drill hole was predicted. When comparing the accuracy in prediction using the pretreated spectra from the prediction without the pretreatment, the accuracy was not lower than that without the pretreatment or the previous study. Therefore, it was concluded that the Spectra-averaging pretreatment does not make a negative effect on the prediction.|$|R

40|$|Composite {{flywheels}} {{are being}} considered as replacements for chemical batteries aboard the International Space Station. A flywheel stores energy in a spinning mass {{that can turn}} a generator to meet power demands. Because of the high rotational speeds of the spinning mass, extensive testing of the flywheel system must be performed prior to flight certification. With this goal in mind, a new scanning system has been developed at the NASA Glenn Research Center for the nondestructive inspection of composite flywheels and flywheel subcomponents. The system uses ultrasonic waves to excite a material and examines the response to detect and locate flaws and material variations. The <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> system uses a transducer to send swept-frequency ultrasonic waves into a test material and then receives the returning signal with a second transducer. The received signal is then analyzed in the frequency domain using a fast Fourier transform. A second fast Fourier transform is performed to examine the spacing of the peaks in the frequency domain. The spacing of the peaks {{is related to the}} standing wave resonances that are present in the material because of the constructive and destructive interferences of the waves in the full material thickness as well as in individual layers within the material. Material variations and flaws are then identified by changes in the amplitudes and positions of the peaks in both the frequency and resonance spacing domains. This work, conducted under a grant through the Cleveland State University, extends the capabilities of an existing point-by-point <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> system, thus allowing full-field automated inspection. Results of an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> scan of a plastic cylinder with intentionally seeded flaws. The result of an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> scan of a plastic cylinder used as a proof-of-concept specimen is shown. The cylinder contains a number of flat bottomed holes of various sizes and shapes. The scanning system was able to successfully detect all the defects in the material. <b>Ultrasonic</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> results for a second specimen are shown along with a conventional ultrasonic C-scan. The second specimen is a section of a flywheel subcomponent that has a series of drilled holes and notches. This specimen is employed as a defect detection standard to evaluate the various nondestructive evaluation methods under consideration. Scanning results demonstrate the ability of the system to detect flaws on the order of 10 mils in the radial direction and 5 mils in the circumferential direction.

The AE technique is a passive ultrasonic signal recording technique capable of online monitoring the internal microstructural activity of young concrete during the hydration process. <b>Ultrasonic</b> wave <b>spectroscopy</b> is traditionally used to evaluate the material's longitudinal and shear wavespeed and attenuation properties (providing properties such as Young's Modulus of Elasticity, Poisson's Ratio and Quality factor) by means of an active excitation of a medium with pulsed sound waves. In addition to these traditional techniques, we have implemented a nonlinear version of <b>ultrasonic</b> wave <b>spectroscopy</b> which probes the nonlinear elastic properties of the microstructure (offering information about the micromechanical behaviour) through the analyses of the harmonic generation from a continuous wave transmission through the concrete sample.

40|$|AbstractUltrasonic {{spectroscopy}} {{is becoming}} a promising particle measurement technique for the characterization of emulsions and suspensions {{over a wide range}} of particle size and concentration especially in the petrochemical, pharmaceutical, adhesives, food and other industries. Compared with other competitive methods like laser diffraction, dynamic light scattering and image analysis, the approach of <b>ultrasonic</b> attenuation <b>spectroscopy</b> possesses significant superiority in the highly-concentrated particulate two-phase flow measurement even in the optical opaque medium, due to the high penetrability of ultrasonic waves through medium, as well as in situ non-invasive measurement and low cost but endurable apparatus. Typically, the overall process by which the particle size distribution of a suspension is measured using <b>ultrasonic</b> attenuation <b>spectroscopy</b> can be divided into two parts: the measurement of frequency-dependent ultrasonic attenuation in two-phase system, and the inversion calculation based on the prediction of mathematical model. The modeling process relies on the fundamental relationship between attenuation spectrum and physical properties, where viscosity could be a critical and complex property because its quantity can influence the ultrasonic attenuation seriously and ultimately the inversion calculation of the resultant particle size distribution. In this paper, a variable viscosity experimental system has been established through changing the concentration of aqueous glycerol solutions or the temperature of glycerol solutions. For the sample of micron-sized glass beads, a series of experiments have been carried out to obtain the attenuation spectrum, which were predicted and interpreted using the ECAH (Epstein, Carhart, Allegra and Hawley) model simultaneously. Hence, the particle size distribution of the glass beads can be retrieved through the inversion calculation...|$|R

40|$|A highly {{efficient}} activation of defects {{is crucial for}} nonlinear, ultrasonic, Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) techniques {{to be able to}} detect incipient damage (e. g. sub-millimeter size cracks or delaminations). Recently, it has been experimentally demonstrated that the elastic wave-defect interaction can be maximized by employing the concept of Local Defect Resonances (LDR). The LDR concept takes advantage of characteristic frequencies of the defect (defect resonances) and urges the application of ultrasonic excitation frequencies which are tuned to the defect. In fact, for nonlinear methodologies, the ultrasonic excitation of the sample should be adjusted at either multiples or integer ratios of the characteristic resonance frequencies. This eventually results in an extreme enhancement of the defect vibration amplitude and substantial rise in efficiency and sensitivity of ultrasonic NDT techniques. To quantify the reliability and capability of nonlinear ultrasonic inspection using the concept of LDR, a simulation study has been performed using a realistic model for the nonlinear dynamic behavior of delaminations and surface breaking cracks. The model allows to investigate the effects at the defect interface in LDR conditions under finite amplitude excitation amplitudes, and allows to demonstrate the strong increase in sensitivity for nonlinear imaging of defects using either nonlinear laser vibrometry or nonlinear air-coupled emission.
