40|$|In this Mechanical Engineering senior project, {{combined}} {{heat and}} power (CHP) systems were evaluated {{based on their}} effectiveness in supplying the energy requirements of a planned building on the Carnegie Mellon University campus. Initial feasibility studies found that three system types could potentially meet the energy needs of the building in a cost-effective manner: a diesel engine-generator system with heat recovery exchangers, a gas microturbine with an exhaust gas boiler, and a high temperature fuel cell with heat recovery exchangers. Using engineering equation solver (EES) software, the thermodynamics of each system was modeled to assess its <b>useful</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>output</b> for different system sizes. The thermodynamic analysis determined the necessary system size needed to meet the predicted maximum thermal load of the building. The required system sizes are (reported as maximum electrical power output) : two 115 kW diesel engine-generator sets, a 250 kW microturbine, or two 250 kW high temperature fuel cells. After sizing the systems, a cash flow analysis model was constructed to evaluate each system under varying assumptions regarding utility rates, fuel costs, and renewable energy incentiv...|$|E

In this paper, <b>thermal</b> <b>output</b> of WK-type strain gages is experimentally determined for temperatures ranging from- 450 F to 230 F.

30|$|For {{the field}} {{measurements}} by Lin et al. (2012), a solar meter, power meter, flow meter, and temperature sensors {{were employed to}} monitor thermal efficiency and actual <b>thermal</b> <b>output</b> of the system. For the FIT, the <b>thermal</b> <b>output</b> should be measured with correct quantity. An incentive should be paid for real energy savings, but not for heat which is vented into the atmosphere or where a heat requirement has been created artificially. A cost-effective heat meter and data logging are required. Details about choice and maintenance of metering were given by Crowther et al. (2010). Further, to see any meter reliability problems, a physical meter reading can be adopted to monitor <b>thermal</b> <b>output</b> from 2015 to 2019, followed by automatic meter reading through the mobile phone system.

40|$|To {{overcome}} {{the disadvantage of}} electric heaters for heating the interior in electric- and hybrid vehicles, consuming electric energy out of the traction battery, a thermal energy storage (TES) filled with metallic Phase Change Material (mPCM) is proposed in this study. Out of the defined requirements to energy storage systems resulting from the application in electric vehicles, which are a <b>thermal</b> <b>output</b> of maximum 3, 5 kW and a storage capacity of 1, 9 kWh, a concept for implementation of the TES into the system of an electric vehicle is shown.

For experimental investigation and proof of concept, a downsized functional demonstrator was built up and filled with the Phase Change Material AlSi 12. The specific heat capacity of the material measured by Difference Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) is 1006 J/kgK in solid state and 1073 J/kgK in liquid state. The melting enthalpy is 511 kJ/kg. The measurement of the storage systems <b>thermal</b> <b>output</b> shows the high potential of mPCM enabling high heat transfer rates, due to their high thermal conductivities.
