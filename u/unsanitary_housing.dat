5|$|The Great Plague {{epidemic}} of 1665 {{is believed to}} have killed a sixth of London's inhabitants, or 80,000 people, and it is sometimes suggested that the fire saved lives in the long run by burning down so much <b>unsanitary</b> <b>housing</b> with their rats and their fleas which transmitted the plague, as plague epidemics did not recur in London after the fire. Historians disagree as to whether the fire played a part in preventing subsequent major outbreaks. The Museum of London website claims that there was a connection, while historian Roy Porter points out that the fire left the most insalubrious parts of London, the slum suburbs, untouched.|$|E
2500|$|Like Cuba and Panama, Brazil {{also led}} a highly {{successful}} sanitation campaign against yellow fever. Beginning in 1903, the campaign led by Oswaldo Goncalves Cruz, then director general of public health, would come not only to eradicate the disease, but to reshape the physical landscape of Brazilian cities, like Rio de Janeiro, as well. During rainy seasons Rio de Janeiro regularly experienced floods, as water from the bay surrounding the city overflowed into Rio's narrow streets. This coupled with the poor drainage systems found throughout Rio, created swampy conditions in the city's neighborhoods. Pools of stagnant water stood year long in city streets and {{proved to be a}} fertile ground for disease carrying mosquitoes. Thus, under Cruz's direction public health units known as [...] "mosquito inspectors" [...] fiercely worked to combat yellow fever throughout Rio by spraying, exterminating rats, and destroying <b>unsanitary</b> <b>housing.</b> Ultimately, [...] the city's sanitation and renovation campaigns reshaped Rio de Janeiro's neighborhoods as its poor residents were pushed from city centers to Rio's suburbs or to towns found in the outskirts of the city. In later years, Rio's most impoverished inhabitants would come to reside in favelas.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the mid-1950s}} {{downtown}} Stamford had fallen prey to severe urban blight. [...] A once vibrant downtown became littered with vacant storefronts, empty lots, weak economy, unsafe and <b>unsanitary</b> <b>housing.</b> [...] The town {{leaders at the}} time sought federal and state funding to launch a revitalization effort that would restore {{the core of the}} city to a vital urban center. [...] On January 27, 1960 the City of Stamford and its redevelopment arm, the Urban Redevelopment Commission, entered into a contract with the Stamford New Urban Corporation, a subsidiary of the locally based and nationally active construction contractor the F. D. Rich Company that would lead to a dramatic altering of the face of downtown Stamford. [...] The Rich Company, led by Frank D. Rich Jr., Robert N. Rich and Chief Legal Counsel Lawrence Gochberg, actively building in 25 of the 50 United States at the time, was selected out of a field of 10 developers vying for the opportunity to become the city's sole redeveloper of the [...] section of the central downtown area known as the Southeast Quadrant. [...] More than $100 million in Federal, State and city funds were invested in a massive property acquisition, relocation, demolition and infrastructure creation program that paved the way {{for one of the most}} sweeping urban renewal efforts ever successfully carried out in the United States. [...] The plan, which involved eminent domain takings, the relocation of 1,100 families and 400 businesses, was implemented amidst much controversy and several lawsuits that delayed the start of the project until 1968 when construction commenced on the three round apartment towers, St. John's Towers. [...] These buildings still contain 360 apartments and originally served as relocation housing for some of the displaced residents. [...] Much of the deteriorated downtown was razed to make way for the new downtown, resulting in a lack of historic buildings and a downtown that looks more contemporary and modern as compared to some its New England counterparts.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century the town was growing fast. New roads were laid out in Callowland (North Watford) and in West Watford, on what had been until then farmland. However, a lot of people still lived in the older cramped and <b>unsanitary</b> <b>houses</b> in the yards and alley-ways opening off the High Street. Some of these people were among those who rioted in 1902 when {{celebrations}} for the King's coronation were postponed. The Council had a programme of slum clearance and was building council houses when the outbreak of war in 1914 brought this to a halt. This work resumed after the war and in the 1920s the Harebreaks estate was developed.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors for disease risk is the undesirable health condition of the houses. The dark, damp and <b>unsanitary</b> <b>house</b> exposes residents to TB. As the housing status is crucial in establishing the conditions for the transmission of TB, {{this study was designed to}} survey the situation of housing environmental health of tuberculosis patients in Yazd on transmission of communicable diseases according to World Health Organization standards in 2010. Methods: In this descriptive study, the housing status of all TB patients of Yazd in 86 cases were collected through a questionnaire survey, observation, and measurement. Results: Results showed that the houses in 22. 1 % of cases were made of adobe and mud, 3. 55 % having average density of room, 50 % of houses had insufficient natural light, 54. 7 % had unfavorable natural ventilation, and 26. 7 %, inadequate heating appliances. Also 32. 6 % of the floor, 32. 6 % of the walls, 37. 2 % of the ceilings, 22. 1 % of the sewage disposal, 12. 8 % of drinking water, 20. 9 % of garbage collection, 11. 6 % of keeping-pet places, and 20. 9 % of waste disposal were in unhealthy conditions. In addition, 2. 3 % of these houses lacked toilet and 7 % lacked bathroom. Conclusions: Comparing the housing condition of people with TB via the existing standards, the status is assessed as unfavorable. Thus improvement of the tuberculosis condition calls for the education programs to inform people of such disadvantages. Also the attention of housing stakeholders and relevant agencies should be drawn to help low-income people...|$|R
50|$|The {{bubonic plague}} of 1897-98 had a {{dramatic}} {{effect on the}} improvements of sanitation and health facilities. Telephone lines were laid to help coordinate anti-plague operations. To {{prevent the spread of}} the epidemic, several <b>unsanitary</b> <b>houses</b> were demolished, and with a lack of manpower to accomplish the demolitions, convicts from the Central Jail were requisitioned. In 1892, the Western extension was formed in the city and sites measuring 30 ft. by 108 ft. were sold, by community. This extension was later named Chamarajendrapet. A similar extension was formed in the north of the city, called Sheshadripuram, after Diwam Sheshadri Iyer. The relieve the city of congestion, two new extensions, Malleswaram and Basavanagudi were formed. New roads were constructed linking the new localities and wards of the city during this time. The Avenue Road, so called because of being lined by trees on either side, was the commercial hub of the city. The B.V.K. Iyengar Road was constructed as a direct tributary of the Mysore Road. The silver jubilee park near K.R. Market was laid to commemorate the silver jubilee of the accession of the king of Mysore, Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV in 1927. The road {{on one side of the}} park was named Silver Jubilee road and Narasimharaja Road on the other. Anand Rao Circle was laid in honour of the Mysore Diwan, while Sajjan Rao Circle was named after a philanthropist. In August 1948, the Governor General of India, C. Rajagopalachari inaugurated the Jayanagar extension, named after the last ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore, Jayachamrajendra Wodeyar. On 3 July 1949, the industrial suburb of the city was inaugurated by the Maharajah of Mysore and was named Rajajinagar. In 1905, Banagalore became the first city in India to be electrified, powered by the hydroelectric plant in Shivanasamudra.|$|R

50|$|Model villages for {{agricultural}} workers were {{founded in the}} early 19th century in Great Britain. The creation of model company towns was particularly evident in Britain during {{the latter half of}} the nineteenth century with the creation of Saltaire (1851), Bournville, Port Sunlight, Creswell and New Earswick (1901) and coincided with the housing-reform movement, which emphasized the improvement of housing for the working class. These model towns contrasted with the overcrowded conditions in British working-class districts, which were often characterized by congested <b>housing,</b> <b>unsanitary</b> conditions, and poor provision of open space and facilities. Model company towns promoted the idea of orderly, planned town development as well as the notion of planning for the needs of the community in order to provide healthier living conditions.|$|R
50|$|Along {{with medical}} concerns, {{sanitary}} living conditions were {{also of the}} utmost importance to the Bowling Green Neighborhood Association. Workers at the Downtown Community House were constantly on the lookout for <b>unsanitary</b> or unacceptable <b>housing</b> conditions, which they would subsequently report to the social worker in charge of building incidents; he would then notify the owner or agency of the building before informing the government agency of the situation. Two weeks after the complaint was recorded, the social worker would follow up on the case and send a letter {{to the head of the}} appropriate municipal department if the requested improvements were not made. This ultimately resulted in a complete housing survey of the area and significant improvements in housing in the neighborhood, sometimes to the point of buildings being torn down or completely remodeled.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how different categories of households (non-migrating, partially-migrating and entire-migrating households) from Cai Nuoc district, Ca Mau province {{in the lower}} saline-intrusion zone of the Mekong Delta, Vietnam have adjusted to increasing salinisation and rapid agricultural change in the decade since the year 2000. In that year shrimp aquaculture was introduced and rapidly adopted in Cai Nuoc district, but {{within a few years}} it had contributed to significant environmental degradation. Limited opportunities for agriculture, and disappointments with shrimp production, in increasingly saline-affected areas resulted in some households experiencing greater vulnerability. Greater vulnerability was experienced in terms of the ability of households to obtain food and earn a living from their land, exposure to financial debt, a reduction in school education participation, new health risks, loss of physical and natural assets, and an inability of households to escape the trappings of poverty. This resulted in both individual and household migration in the face of environmental degradation and limited income generation. While migration proved to be a helpful solution and positive strategy for the majority of households in enabling them to sustain livelihoods, some migrants also experienced further vulnerability in their destinations, working under unsafe conditions in factories or construction sites, and living in crowded and <b>unsanitary</b> boarding <b>houses.</b> By contrast, other households were able to adapt, in-situ, to the increasing salinisation of the landscape. Household assets, including land size, the relative age of household members and non-farm sources of income at the time of environmental change, were the main differences between households that influenced the ability or inability to adapt and thus shaping potential migration outcomes. Migration could be an adaptation strategy, a failure to adapt or a combination of both. Access is restricted to staff and students of the University of Sydney. UniKey credentials are required.

5000|$|Careful {{consideration}} {{was given}} to the form and infrastructure of the town, focusing on the creation of individual suburban type neighbourhoods (precincts), each with their own architectural identity. Engineers, planners, builders and architects were tasked with creating not only good quality mass-produced housing but green spaces, tree planting, wildlife corridors and soft and hard landscaping. This was seen as an equally important part of the process, helping to provide a sense of place and connection to the land that a New Town was felt to need in order to become a successful place where people would want to live and raise children. Separating industry as far as possible from housing areas in planned industrial estates was a key element of early plans. This was at the time seen as an important change from the [...] "chaotic", congested and polluted industrial towns and cities of the previous centuries where cramped <b>unsanitary</b> <b>housing</b> and dirty industries were built in close proximity to one another.

50|$|Fly {{strike is}} a rare {{condition}} which mostly affects rabbits kept in extremely unsanitary conditions and {{is more likely to}} occur during summer months. Fly strike happens when flies (particularly the botfly) lay their eggs in the damp or soiled fur or in an open wound of a rabbit. Within 12 hours, the eggs hatch into the larval stage of the fly, known as maggots. The maggots, initially small and almost invisible to the naked eye, can burrow into the skin of the rabbit and feed on the animal's tissue. Within 3-4 days, the larvae can be large as 15 mm long. In rare cases, if not treated, the rabbit can pass into shock and die. The most susceptible animals are those living in <b>unsanitary</b> <b>housing,</b> older rabbits that do not move much, and those that are unable to clean their bottom areas carefully. Rabbits raised on solid floors are more susceptible than rabbits raised on wire floors. Rabbits exhibiting one or more episodes of diarrhea are often inspected, especially during the summer months. In 2002, the medicine Rearguard was approved in the United Kingdom for 10-week-per-application prevention of fly strike.|$|E
40|$|When, {{not long}} since, I {{was asked to}} try to explain the {{function}} [...] if any [...] of law in a democratic society to a conference of scholars and writers interested in demonstrating American solidarity, I hesitated long before undertaking the task. Not that I lacked convictions, for a considerable battling in the fields of law and education had yielded me some firmly held views. I did fear, however, that these views were, for most students, so commonplace as hardly to justify restatement. That law is but the tool, not the driving force, of the great society, that it must remain ever servant, never master, is a statement hardly likely to startle modern ears. But I recalled how repeatedly I had found myself brought up short with renewed evidences that however general may be the lip service paid these views, yet there was deeply ingrained in man the feeling that law embodies something outside and beyond one 2 ̆ 7 s self [...] something partaking of the divine-to which he must make obeisance. And so ultimately I undertook the task. For it has seemed to me that, whatever might be the temporary uses of such a feeling among those with whom a policeman 2 ̆ 7 s club is more authoritative than are philosophical ideals, from a longer point of view it was not only false and misleading, but actually inimical to the democratic way of life. If the people are not in command of their own government, but are actually subordinate to some yet more remote sovereign who upholds and justifies <b>unsanitary</b> conditions, poor <b>housing,</b> long hours of labor, and general defiance of social welfare legislation as a freedom required by some vague constitutional command or higher law of nature, then we are nearer either anarchy or the rule of the autocratic few than we are democracy. And though some of the excrescences of the higher law doctrine have been pruned away in modern jurisprudence, yet enough remains alive to give us pause, indeed, to require some thoughtful consideration as to the role of law in a modern democracy...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{will examine}} the Phyllis Wheatley's {{activism}} in the settlement housing movement in Chicago between 1910 and 1930. Beginning in 1908, the Phyllis Wheatley Home housed Black migrant women and girls who arrived to Chicago without relatives and economic resources. The home was established due to racial segregation in housing and mainstream settlement homes; <b>unsanitary</b> <b>housing</b> conditions; and the sexual exploitation of Black women. The Phyllis Wheatley Home offered adequate housing for Black migrant women; and protection from sexual exploitation. However, the Phyllis Wheatley Club relied on the financial resource from Black civic organizations and institutions toward fulfilling their objectives. The club's settlement work exemplified what sociologist Patricia Hill-Collins labels their "other mothering" role to Black migrant girls and women.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} a number of American stories which helped educate people and bring about legal or social change. There are many stories which caused major or minor legal and {{political}} change, particularly, in the United States. Some of them are written by Herman Melville, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Upton Sinclair and Sidney Kingsley. After the publication of White Jacket by Melville the novel was distributed to the U. S.

Stowe’s Uncle Tom’s Cabin is another notable example of a literary text which triggered an enormous social change in America; in this case, the Civil War and the abolition of slavery. Sinclair’s The Jungle was influential in obtaining passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act. Kingsley’s play, Dead End raised awareness about poverty and the inadequacy of housing in the slums of New York City and was responsible for the Wagner Housing Bill which was passed by the U. S.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} housing related {{problems}} and constraints faced by poor {{people living with}} HIV/AIDS in Gaborone. The study concurrently examines the housing interventions provided by the different housing providers, particularly looking into the availability, accessibility and affordability of the housing-related services in the form suitable for PPLWHA. Housing {{is one of the}} largest unmet needs among the poor people living with HIV/AIDS in Gaborone although it is a basic need. The lack of sanitary and stable housing has been key in housing and HIV/AIDS debates around the world and has been attributed with profound effects on the management of HIV/AIDS among PPLWHA. The study hinges on critical realism theory and posits that the housing problems faced by PPLWHA are not an outcome of a single cause but of a web of interacting and interconnected, social, economic, political and environmental factors apparent in Botswana. A qualitative semi-structured strategy through in-depth interviews is used in this study to explore the following: firstly, the housing problems and constraints faced by PPLWHA as well as the strategies they adopt to respond to these problems. Secondly, to gain perspectives of lands and housing policy makers as well as personnel offering housing and housing related services who were interviewed to provide a picture of the implementation of policies, programs and services intended to respond to the housing for poor people. The major conclusion of the thesis is that poverty and HIV/AIDS are interconnected and primary in the everyday life of PPLWHA, and limit their opportunity to afford and access sanitary housing. Consequently they are limited to inhabit poor and <b>unsanitary</b> <b>housing</b> environments in informal housing markets which make it difficult for them to manage their health. The study argues that the housing problems faced by PPLWHA go beyond the observable conditions of poverty and HIV/AIDS. There are other underlying structural barriers, observable and non-observable, which contribute to the housing problems faced by PPLWHA. Firstly, the lack of sanitary and affordable housing, which incorporates the issue of housing finance which is suitable for those on a low income and the poor. Secondly, limited governmental support in the regulation and control of the informal housing market for low income people, thirdly the lack of collaboration of housing organisations aimed at housing the poor and vulnerable people in the country and fourthly the social structures such as cultural norms and traditional beliefs and gender inequalities which are interconnected with HIV/AIDS and poverty which exacerbate housing problems of PPLWHA. This study recommends that if Botswana is to tackle the spread and treatment of HI V and AIDS in society, the lack of adequate housing must be addressed as a barrier to effective HIV prevention, management and care. It is crucial to address the need for stable housing for people with HIV and AIDS...|$|E
