At the end of May, the group played four nights at the Kinetic Playground, Chicago, and they noticed the audience would all stand <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> and stay standing.

25|$|Stimulus control {{therapy is}} a {{treatment}} for patients who have conditioned themselves to associate the bed, or sleep in general, with a negative response. As stimulus control therapy involves taking steps to control the sleep environment, it is sometimes referred interchangeably {{with the concept of}} sleep hygiene. Examples of such environmental modifications include using the bed for sleep or sex only, not for activities such as reading or watching television; waking <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> every morning, including on weekends; going to bed only when sleepy and when there is a high likelihood that sleep will occur; leaving the bed and beginning an activity in another location if sleep does not result in a reasonably brief period of time after getting into bed (commonly ~20 min); reducing the subjective effort and energy expended trying to fall asleep; avoiding exposure to bright light during nighttime hours, and eliminating daytime naps.|$|E
25|$|The first {{conveying}} {{started in}} 1917, {{and the following}} January the city engineer started construction, but this soon terminated. At the same time Graakalbanen started preparing the first lots for sale, including installation of water, sewage and roads. In June 1919, the engineering company Grøndahl & Kjørholt took over the work, planning to be finished to Lian by 1921. However, by June 1920, the rising prices resulted in the money being used <b>up.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> {{it turned out that}} the rolling stock was too much more expensive than expected; ordering of rolling stock was therefore delayed. In 1921, no construction was done on the line. Not before Trondhjems og Stridens Sparebank issued a loan of NOK 1.6 million was it possible to continue construction. This was based on mortgaging all assets, as well as a NOK 500,000 guarantee from the city council. While work previously had been along the whole route, it was then only concentrated on the section Ila–Munkvoll, where the depot would be located.|$|E
30|$|Lin et al. [14] {{point out}} that in {{infrastructure}} mode, wireless devices waste their powers on idle state, as the devices should continually sense channel and overhear the ongoing transmissions of the other devices. Also, the contentions among devices waking <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> moment for traffic retrieval can cause power waste. The authors provide a DeepSleep scheme to enhance the 802.11 PSM for energy-harvesting devices, where the devices short of power can enter into doze mode {{for a long period}} and then access the channel with a higher priority. In order to avoid a large number of devices waking <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> moment, a random deferring algorithm is applied to randomly defer the wake up time of devices, which can alleviate the channel contentions among devices.|$|R

Hutcherson played on the high school's soccer team and has been a keen sports enthusiast since, also displaying a passion for football and tennis. At the age of 13, he participated in a triathlon.

500|$|The town's {{fields were}} {{enclosed}} in 1796 and {{a map of}} the village was drawn <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> showing the settlement along Town Road and Townside Road with Rector Field and Earl Field to the north and north-east respectively. At the time, more than 210 acres of land were allotted to the rectory by Lord Bristol in place of the tithes it had previously been entitled to. During the mid and late-19th century, the population of the old village of Quarrington declined (from 98 in 1851 to 72 in 1871). Aside from the rectory and church, the village included two large farms and a cluster of labourers cottages around Town Road. By 1872, the parish spanned 1,620 acres and the village contained 63 houses. The same year, Trollope wrote that [...] "the appearance of this small village, lying around its well cared for church, is very pleasing". As Sleaford expanded, houses were built along London and Station Roads, pushing the town inside the Quarrington parish boundaries in what became New Quarrington. Sanitation in the poorest parts of Sleaford worsened during the 19th century and a Local Board of Health was charged with improving living conditions. In 1879, Lord Bristol sold land on Quarrington Hill to the board, who built a pumping station to transport clean fenland water east into the town.|$|E

However, Torchwood media in 2011 since provided a direct explanation for the Rift. In the radio drama [...] "The House of the Dead", Jack visits a haunted location where the Rift allows ghosts, including the deceased Ianto Jones, to enter into the living world. To close the Rift forever and seal an ancient evil on the other side of it, Jack creates a device designed to seal the Rift. The device will also provide Jack an end to his cycle of resurrections.

[...] Recent research in the Jesus College archives, however, suggests that Henry did not enter Jesus College before 1641, unless he did so in 1639 without matriculating or paying an admission fee, and left before the record in the surviving buttery books resumes in December of that year.
