25|$|Imagine {{a pair of}} {{particles}} that can be measured at distant locations. Suppose that the measurement devices have settings, which are angles—e.g., the devices measure something called spin in some direction. The experimenter chooses the directions, one for each particle, separately. Suppose the measurement outcome is binary (e.g., spin up, spin down). Suppose the two particles are perfectly anti-correlated—in the sense that whenever both measured in the same direction, one gets identically opposite outcomes, when both measured in opposite directions they always give the same outcome. The only way to imagine how this works is that both particles leave their common source with, somehow, the outcomes they will deliver when measured in any possible direction. (How else could particle 1 know how to deliver the same answer as particle 2 when measured in the same direction? They don't know in advance how {{they are going to}} be measured...). The measurement on particle 2 (after switching its sign) can be thought of as telling <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> same measurement on particle 1 would have given.|$|E

2500|$|Expression {{profiling}} is {{a logical}} next step after sequencing a genome: the sequence tells <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> cell could possibly do, while the expression profile tells us what it is actually doing {{at a point in}} time. Genes contain the instructions for making messenger RNA (mRNA), but at any moment each cell makes mRNA from {{only a fraction of the}} genes it carries. [...] If a gene is used to produce mRNA, it is considered [...] "on", otherwise [...] "off". [...] Many factors determine whether a gene is on or off, such as the time of day, whether or not the cell is actively dividing, its local environment, and chemical signals from other cells. For instance, skin cells, liver cells and nerve cells turn on (express) somewhat different genes and that is in large part what makes them different. [...] Therefore, an expression profile allows one to deduce a cell's type, state, environment, and so forth.|$|E

Fowler also said he was growing tired of Kröd's {{constant}} prudishness around sexual norm-breakers, and that the Loquasto, Zezelryck and Bruce characters are growing unnecessary because, [...] "not every joke needs to have {{each member of the}} gang chime in with a comment telling <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> joke is." [...] However, Fowler said he enjoyed the subplot with Dongalor and his unnamed girlfriend, and said Lucas and McQueen work very well together. Doug Knoop of The Seattle Times, however, singled this episode out as {{one of the main reasons}} he liked the series: [...] "It may not be to everyone's taste, but in last week's episode when (Krod) and his band of warriors ended up in a hot tub with a Cyclops, I knew this new outrageous parody series had found a place in my heart." ...|$|E

Only when the South Ossetians opened up with artillery on Georgian villages, did the offensive to take Tskhinvali begin.” “All evidence available to the country team supports [...] Saakashvili’s statement that this fight was not Georgia’s original intention,” reads the cable. “Key Georgian officials, who would have had responsibility for an attack on South Ossetia have been on leave, and the Georgians only began mobilizing August 7 once the attack was well underway.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Their {{account is}} in full {{agreement}} with Aristotle's description of Plato's metaphysical doctrine. In Metaphysics he writes: [...] "Now since the Forms are the causes of everything else, he [...] supposed that their elements are the elements of all things. Accordingly the material principle is the Great and Small , and the essence is the One (τὸ ἕν), since the numbers are derived from the Great and Small by participation in the One" [...] (987 b). [...] "From this account {{it is clear that}} he only employed two causes: that of the essence, and the material cause; for the Forms are the cause of the essence in everything else, and the One is the cause of it in the Forms. He also tells <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> material substrate is of which the Forms are predicated in the case of sensible things, and the One in that of the Forms - that it is this the duality (the Dyad, ἡ δυάς), the Great and Small (τὸ μέγα καὶ τὸ μικρόν). Further, he assigned to these two elements respectively the causation of good and of evil" [...] (988 a).|$|E
2500|$|Theodoret writes [...] "Malachi {{teaches us}} how, when Antichrist shall presume on these things, the great Elias shall appear, {{preaching to the}} Jews the coming of Christ: and he shall convert many, {{for this is the}} meaning of, [...] "he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children," [...] i. e., the Jews (for these he calls fathers, as being older in knowledge) to those who {{believed}} from the Gentiles. They who shall believe through the preaching of the great Elias, and shall join themselves to the Gentiles who seized the salvation sent to them, shall become one church. He hints, how when these things are done by Antichrist, Michael the Archangel will set all in motion, that Elias should come and foreannounce the coming of the Lord that the then Jews may obtain salvation." [...] And on this place, [...] "Knowing well, that they would neither obey the law, nor receive Him when He came, but would deliver Him to be crucified, He promises them, in His unspeakable love for man, that He will again send Elias as a herald of salvation, 'Lo, I will send you Elias the Tishbite.' And signifying the time, He added, 'Before the great and terrible day of the Lord shall come:' He named the Day of His Second Coming. But He teaches <b>us,</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> great Elias shall do, when he comes, 'Who shall bring back the heart of the father to the son' etc. And pointing out the end, for which Elias should first come, 'Lest I come and smite the earth utterly.' For lest, finding you all in unbelief, I send you all to that endless punishment, Elias will first come, and will persuade you, O Jews, to unite you indissolubly with those, who from the Gentiles believe in Me, and to be united to My one Church." ...|$|E
