40|$|Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) {{technique}} {{based on}} traditional liquid phase deposition and bio-inspired theory {{is one of}} the most promising processes for preparing inorganic thin films. Using octadecyl-trichloro-silane (OTS) as stencil, tetragonal BaTiO 3 thin film was successfully prepared on glass wafers in the solution consisting of (NH 4) 2 TiF 6, Ba(NO 3) 2 and H 3 BO 3 with SAMs technique. Hydrophilic characteristic mensuration of glass wafers and photographs of atomic force microscopy (AFM) indicate that the hydrophobe substrate changes into hydrophile by <b>UV</b> <b>iradiation,</b> and a modification of OTS-SAM is changed by UV light. Photographs of metallographic microscope indicate that the surface of BaTiO 3 thin film deposited on OTS-SAM is smooth and homogeneous, and an induction of BaTiO 3 thin film deposition is directed by OTS-SAM. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) results show that the BaTiO 3 thin film with well-crystalline tetragonal phase is successfully prepared after annealing at 600 ¡䟩n air for 2 h. BaTiO 3 thin film grows on glass substrate with a rod-like morphology, the length of the nanowire is in the range from 500 nm to 1000 nm, which is composed of nanosized grains of around 100 nm. The formation mechanism of OTS-SAM and BaTiO 3 thin film is carefully discussed. </FONT...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{a series}} of acridinones and benzo-fused acridinones {{have been used for}} the first time as {{efficient}} photosensitizers for the norbornadiene-quadricyclane isomerization by near <b>UV</b> and visible <b>iradiation.</b> Their triplet energies (240 - 280 kJ · Mol- 1) are well below the value of 290 kJ · Mol- 1 which is generally assumed for norbornadiene. A mechanism is postulated involving an exciplex between sensitizer and norbornadiene. Limiting quantum yields of 0. 5 and higher have been determined for this valence isomerization extrapolated to infinite norbornadiene concentration. Exciplex formation is supported by measurements of the rate of constant k 2 for quenching of excited sensitizer by norbornadiene, yielding values which are much smaller than the diffusion-controlled quenching constant...|$|R
