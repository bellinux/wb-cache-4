5|$|The {{first factor}} {{determining}} optimal defense is risk: {{how likely is}} it that a plant or certain plant parts will be attacked? This is also related to the plant apparency hypothesis, which states that a plant will invest heavily in broadly effective defenses when the plant is easily found by herbivores. Examples of apparent plants that produce generalized protections include long-living trees, shrubs, and perennial grasses. <b>Unapparent</b> plants, such as short-lived plants of early successional stages, on the other hand, preferentially invest in small amounts of qualitative toxins that are effective against {{all but the most}} specialized herbivores.|$|E

500|$|The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) {{initiated}} {{a task force}} to concentrate on identifying the most invasive animals. The agency created a list of [...] "Reptiles of Concern" [...] for the Burmese python, African rock python (Python sebae), amethystine python (Morelia amethystinus), reticulated python (Python reticulatus), green anaconda (Eunectes murinus), and the Nile monitor. Florida also began requiring owners to pay a permit fee of $100 a year and place microchips on the animals. These predators are included on the list for their formidable size and aggressive natures; animals that were in the Everglades before the list was created, however, are breeding in the wild. To combat the number of exotic snakes in the U.S., and specifically in South Florida, the U.S. Department of the Interior added four species of snakes—Burmese pythons, two subspecies of African rock pythons (northern and southern), and the yellow anaconda (Eunectes notaeus)—to Lacey Act provisions, making their import into the U.S. illegal, in 2012. Exotic birds do not attract the same amount of attention. They too have been brought to Florida as part of the pet trade and escape, get released by dealers attempting to avoid quarantine restrictions, or escape from damaged cages and artificial habitats during tropical storms. Typically, however, most nonindigenous birds live closer to populated areas; some populations of birds establish themselves but decline for <b>unapparent</b> reasons.|$|E

6000|$|I {{know that}} certain crazy pedants have {{attempted}} to counter this difficulty by maintaining that education is not instruction at all, does not teach by authority at all. They present the process as coming, not from the outside, from the teacher, but entirely from inside the boy. Education, they say, is the Latin for leading out or drawing out the dormant faculties of each person. Somewhere far down in the dim boyish soul is a primordial yearning to learn Greek accents or to wear clean collars; and the schoolmaster only gently and tenderly liberates this imprisoned purpose. Sealed up in the newborn babe are the intrinsic secrets of how to eat asparagus {{and what was the}} date of Bannockburn. The educator only draws out the child's own <b>unapparent</b> love of long division; only leads out the child's slightly veiled preference for milk pudding to tarts. I am not sure that I believe in the derivation; I have heard the disgraceful suggestion that [...] "educator," [...] if applied to a Roman schoolmaster, did not mean leading our young functions into freedom; but only meant taking out little boys for a walk. But I am much more certain that I do not agree with the doctrine; I think it would be about as sane to say that the baby's milk comes from the baby as to say that the baby's educational merits do. There is, indeed, in each living creature a collection of forces and functions; but education means producing these in particular shapes and training them to particular purposes, or it means nothing at all. Speaking is the most practical instance of the whole situation. You may indeed [...] "draw out" [...] squeals and grunts from the child by simply poking him and pulling him about, a pleasant but cruel pastime to which many psychologists are addicted. But you will wait and watch very patiently indeed before you draw the English language out of him. That you have got to put into him; and there is an end of the matter.|$|E

60|$|All this figurative language, {{which was}} like the prelude to a solemn piece of music, gave Fan the idea that {{something}} of very great importance was about to follow. But, alas! the mixture, and the rose-honey sweetness of hope, failed to prevent the attack which Constance had feared, and he coughed so long and so violently that Fan, after being a distressed spectator for some time, grew positively alarmed. By-and-by, glancing at her friend's face as she stood bending over the sufferer, holding his bowed head between her palms, she concluded {{that it was no}} more than an everyday attack, and that no fatal results need be feared. Relieved of her apprehension, she began to think less of the husband and more of the wife; for what resignation, what courage and strength she had shown since her unhappy marriage, and what self-sacrificing devotion to her weak unworthy life-partner! Or was it a mistake, she now asked herself, to regard him as weak and unworthy? Had not Constance, with a finer insight --her superior in this as in most things--seen the <b>unapparent</b> strength, the secret hidden virtue, that was in him, and which would show itself when the right time came? No, Fan could not believe that. Tom Starbrow and the poor pale-faced curate in his rusty coat were true strong men, and the woman that married either of them would not lean on a reed that would break and pierce her to the quick; and Captain Horton was also a strong man, although he had certainly been a very bad one. But this man, in spite of his nimble brains and eloquent tongue, was weak and unstable, hopelessly--fatally. The suffering and the poverty which had come to these two, which in the wife's case only made the innate virtue of her spirit to shine forth with starlike lustre, would make and could make no difference to him. Words were nothing to Fan; not because of his words had she forgiven Captain Horton his crime; and if Merton had spoken with the eloquence of a Ruskin, or an angel, it would have had no effect on her. She considered his life only, and it failed to satisfy her.|$|E
60|$|I {{must not}} forget one {{incident}} {{that occurred during}} this visit to London. The visits of Merrival to Windsor, before frequent, had suddenly ceased. At this time where but a hair's line separated the living from the dead, I feared that our friend had become a victim to the all-embracing evil. On this occasion I went, dreading the worst, to his dwelling, to see if I could be of any service to those of his family who might have survived. The house was deserted, and {{had been one of}} those assigned to the invading strangers quartered in London. I saw his astronomical instruments put to strange uses, his globes defaced, his papers covered with abstruse calculations destroyed. The neighbours could tell me little, till I lighted on a poor woman who acted as nurse in these perilous times. She told me that all the family were dead, except Merrival himself, who had gone mad-- mad, she called it, yet on questioning her further, it appeared that he was possessed only by the delirium of excessive grief. This old man, tottering {{on the edge of the}} grave, and prolonging his prospect through millions of calculated years,--this visionary who had not seen starvation in the wasted forms of his wife and children, or plague in the horrible sights and sounds that surrounded him--this astronomer, apparently dead on earth, and living only in the motion of the spheres--loved his family with <b>unapparent</b> but intense affection. Through long habit they had become a part of himself; his want of worldly knowledge, his absence of mind and infant guilelessness, made him utterly dependent on them. It was not till one of them died that he perceived their danger; one by one they were carried off by pestilence; and his wife, his helpmate and supporter, more necessary to him than his own limbs and frame, which had hardly been taught the lesson of self-preservation, the kind companion whose voice always spoke peace to him, closed her eyes in death. The old man felt the system of universal nature which he had so long studied and adored, slide from under him, and he stood among the dead, and lifted his voice in curses.--No wonder that the attendant should interpret as phrensy the harrowing maledictions of the grief-struck old man.|$|E
6000|$|If a {{selection}} {{could be made}} from those parts only of Keats's correspondence which show him at his best, we should have an anthology full of intuitions of beauty, even of wisdom, and breathing the very spirit of generous youth; one unrivalled for zest, whim, fancy, and amiability, and written in an English which by its peculiar alert and varied movement sometimes recalls, perhaps more closely than {{that of any other}} writer (for the young Cockney has Shakspeare in his blood), the prose passages of Hamlet and Much Ado about Nothing. Had the correspondence never been printed before, were it there to be dealt with for the first time, this method of selection would no doubt be the tempting one to apply to it. But such a treatment is now hardly possible, and in any case would hardly be quite fair; since the object, or at all events the effect, of publishing a man's correspondence is not merely to give literary pleasure--it is to make the man himself known; and the revelation, though it need not be wholly without reserve, is bound to be just and proportionate as far as it goes. Even as an artist, in the work which he himself published to the world, Keats was not one of those of whom it could be said, [...] "his worst he kept, his best he gave." [...] Rather he gave promiscuously, in the just confidence that among the failures and half-successes of his inexperienced youth would be found enough of the best to establish his place among the poets after his death. Considering all things, the nature of the man, the difficulty of separating the exquisite from the common, the healthful from the diseased, in his mind and work, considering also the use that has already been made of the materials, I have decided in this edition to give the correspondence almost unpruned; omitting a few passages of mere crudity, hardly more than two pages in all, but not attempting to suppress those which betray the weak places in the writer's nature, his flaws of taste and training, his movements of waywardness, irritability, and morbid suspicion. Only the biographer without tact, the critic without balance, will insist on these. A truer as well as more charitable judgment will recognise that what was best in Keats was also what was most real, and will be fortified by remembering that to those who knew him his faults were almost <b>unapparent,</b> and that no man was ever held by his friends in more devoted or more unanimous affection while he lived and afterwards.|$|E
6000|$|And I often {{smile at}} my {{consciousness}} that certain conservative prepossessions have mingled themselves {{for me with}} the influences of our midland scenery, from {{the tops of the}} elms down to the buttercups and the little wayside vetches. Naturally enough. That part of my father's prime to which he oftenest referred had fallen on the days when the great wave of political enthusiasm and belief in a speedy regeneration of all things had ebbed, and the supposed millennial initiative of France was turning into a Napoleonic empire, the sway of an Attila with a mouth speaking proud things in a jargon half revolutionary, half Roman. Men were beginning to shrink timidly from the memory of their own words and from the recognition of the fellowships they had formed ten years before; and even reforming Englishmen for the most part were willing to wait for the perfection of society, if only they could keep their throats perfect and help to drive away the chief enemy of mankind from our coasts. To my father's mind the noisy teachers of revolutionary doctrine were, to speak mildly, a variable mixture of the fool and the scoundrel; the welfare of the nation lay in a strong Government which could maintain order; and I was accustomed to hear him utter the word [...] "Government" [...] in a tone that charged it with awe, and made it part of my effective religion, in contrast with the word [...] "rebel," [...] which seemed to carry the stamp of evil in its syllables, and, lit by the fact that Satan was the first rebel, made an argument dispensing with more detailed inquiry. I gathered that our national troubles in the first two decades of this century were not at all due to the mistakes of our administrators; and that England, with its fine Church and Constitution, would have been exceedingly well off if every British subject had been thankful for what was provided, and had minded his own business--if, for example, numerous Catholics of that period had been aware how very modest they ought to be considering they were Irish. The times, I heard, had often been bad; but I was constantly hearing of [...] "bad times" [...] as a name for actual evenings and mornings when the godfathers who gave them that name appeared to me remarkably comfortable. Altogether, my father's England seemed to me lovable, laudable, full of good men, and having good rulers, from Mr Pitt on to the Duke of Wellington, until he was for emancipating the Catholics; and it was so far from prosaic to me that I looked into it for a more exciting romance than such as I could find in my own adventures, which consisted mainly in fancied crises calling for the resolute wielding of domestic swords and firearms against <b>unapparent</b> robbers, rioters, and invaders who, it seemed, in my father's prime had more chance of being real. The morris-dancers had not then dwindled to a ragged and almost vanished rout (owing the traditional name probably to the historic fancy of our superannuated groom); also, the good old king was alive and well, which made all the more difference because I had no notion what he was and did--only understanding in general that if he had been still on the throne he would have hindered everything that wise persons thought undesirable.|$|E

[...] 20 [...] Half yet remaines unsung, but narrower bound [...] Within the visible Diurnal Spheare; [...] Standing on Earth, not rapt above the Pole, [...] More safe I Sing with mortal voice, unchang'd [...] To hoarce or mute, though fall'n on evil dayes, [...] On evil dayes though fall'n, and evil tongues; [...] In darkness, and with dangers compast round, [...] And solitude; yet not alone, while thou [...] Visit'st my slumbers Nightly, or when Morn [...] Purples the East: still govern thou my Song, [...] 30 [...] Urania, and fit audience find, though few. [...] But drive farr off the barbarous dissonance [...] Of Bacchus and his Revellers, the Race [...] Of that wilde Rout that tore the Thracian Bard [...] In Rhodope, where Woods and Rocks had Eares [...] To rapture, till the savage clamor dround [...] Both Harp and Voice; nor could the Muse defend [...] Her Son. So fail not thou, who thee implores: [...] For thou art Heav'nlie, shee an empty dreame. [...] Say Goddess, what ensu'd when Raphael, [...] 40 [...] The affable Arch-angel, had forewarn'd [...] Adam by dire example to beware [...] Apostasie, by what befell in Heaven [...] To those Apostates, least the like befall [...] In Paradise to Adam or his Race, [...] Charg'd not to touch the interdicted Tree, [...] If they transgress, and slight that sole command, [...] So easily obeyd amid the choice [...] Of all tasts else to please thir appetite, [...] Though wandring. He with his consorted Eve [...] 50 [...] The storie heard attentive, and was fill'd [...] With admiration, and deep Muse to heare [...] Of things so high and strange, things to thir thought [...] So unimaginable as hate in Heav'n, [...] And Warr so neer the Peace of God in bliss [...] With such confusion: but the evil soon [...] Driv'n back redounded as a flood on those [...] From whom it sprung, impossible to mix [...] With Blessedness. Whence Adam soon repeal'd [...] The doubts that in his heart arose: and now [...] 60 [...] Led on, yet sinless, with desire to know [...] What neerer might concern him, how this World [...] Of Heav'n and Earth conspicuous first began, [...] When, and whereof created, for what cause, [...] What within Eden or without was done [...] Before his memorie, as one whose drouth [...] Yet scarce allay'd still eyes the current streame, [...] Whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites, [...] Proceeded thus to ask his Heav'nly Guest. [...] Great things, and full of wonder in our eares, [...] 70 [...] Farr differing from this World, thou hast reveal'd [...] Divine Interpreter, by favour sent [...] Down from the Empyrean to forewarne [...] Us timely of what might else have bin our loss, [...] Unknown, which human knowledg could not reach: [...] For which to the infinitly Good we owe [...] Immortal thanks, and his admonishment [...] Receave with solemne purpose to observe [...] Immutably his sovran will, the end [...] Of what we are. But since thou hast voutsaf't [...] 80 [...] Gently for our instruction to impart [...] Things above Earthly thought, which yet concernd [...] Our knowing, as to highest wisdom seemd, [...] Deign to descend now lower, and relate [...] What may no less perhaps availe us known, [...] How first began this Heav'n which we behold [...] Distant so high, with moving Fires adornd [...] Innumerable, and this which yeelds or fills [...] All space, the ambient Aire wide interfus'd [...] Imbracing round this florid Earth, what cause [...] 90 [...] Mov'd the Creator in his holy Rest [...] Through all Eternitie so late to build [...] In Chaos, and the work begun, how soon [...] Absolv'd, if unforbid thou maist unfould [...] What wee, not to explore the secrets aske [...] Of his Eternal Empire, but the more [...] To magnifie his works, the more we know. [...] And the great Light of Day yet wants to run [...] Much of his Race though steep, suspens in Heav'n [...] Held by thy voice, thy potent voice he heares, [...] 100 [...] And longer will delay to heare thee tell [...] His Generation, and the rising Birth [...] Of Nature from the <b>unapparent</b> Deep: [...] Or if the Starr of Eevning and the Moon [...] Haste to thy audience, Night with her will bring [...] Silence, and Sleep listning to thee will watch, [...] Or we can bid his absence, till thy Song [...] End, and dismiss thee ere the Morning shine. [...] Thus Adam his illustrous Guest besought: [...] And thus the Godlike Angel answerd milde. [...] 110 [...] This also thy request with caution askt [...] Obtaine: though to recount Almightie works [...] What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice, [...] Or heart of man suffice to comprehend? [...] Yet what thou canst attain, which best may serve [...] To glorifie the Maker, and inferr [...] Thee also happier, shall not be withheld [...] Thy hearing, such Commission from above [...] I have receav'd, to answer thy desire [...] Of knowledge within bounds; beyond abstain [...] 120 [...] To ask, nor let thine own inventions hope [...] Things not reveal'd, which th' invisible King, [...] Onely Omniscient, hath supprest in Night, [...] To none communicable in Earth or Heaven: [...] Anough is left besides to search and know. [...] But Knowledge is as food, and needs no less [...] Her Temperance over Appetite, to know [...] In measure what the mind may well contain, [...] Oppresses else with Surfet, and soon turns [...] Wisdom to Folly, as Nourishment to Winde. [...] 130 [...] Know then, that after Lucifer from Heav'n [...] (So call him, brighter once amidst the Host [...] Of Angels, then that Starr the Starrs among) [...] Fell with his flaming Legions through the Deep [...] Into his place, and the great Son returnd [...] Victorious with his Saints, th' Omnipotent [...] Eternal Father from his Throne beheld [...] Thir multitude, and to his Son thus spake. [...] At least our envious Foe hath fail'd, who thought [...] All like himself rebellious, by whose aid [...] 140 [...] This inaccessible high strength, the seat [...] Of Deitie supream, us dispossest, [...] He trusted to have seis'd, and into fraud [...] Drew many, whom thir place knows here no more; [...] Yet farr the greater part have kept, I see, [...] Thir station, Heav'n yet populous retaines [...] Number sufficient to possess her Realmes [...] Though wide, and this high Temple to frequent [...] With Ministeries due and solemn Rites: [...] But least his heart exalt him in the harme [...] 150 [...] Already done, to have dispeopl'd Heav'n, [...] My damage fondly deem'd, I can repaire [...] That detriment, if such it be to lose [...] Self-lost, {{and in a moment}} will create [...] Another World, out of one man a Race [...] Of men innumerable, there to dwell, [...] Not here, till by degrees of merit rais'd [...] They open to themselves at length the way [...] Up hither, under long obedience tri'd, [...] And Earth be chang'd to Heavn, & Heav'n to Earth, [...] 160 [...] One Kingdom, Joy and Union without end. [...] Mean while inhabit laxe, ye Powers of Heav'n, [...] And thou my Word, begotten Son, by thee [...] This I perform, speak thou, and be it don: [...] My overshadowing Spirit and might with thee [...] I send along, ride forth, and bid the Deep [...] Within appointed bounds be Heav'n and Earth, [...] Boundless the Deep, because I am who fill [...] Infinitude, nor vacuous the space. [...] Though I uncircumscrib'd my self retire, [...] 170 [...] And put not forth my goodness, which is free [...] To act or not, Necessitie and Chance [...] Approach not mee, and what I will is Fate. [...] So spake th' Almightie, and to what he spake [...] His Word, the Filial Godhead, gave effect. [...] Immediate are the Acts of God, more swift [...] Then time or motion, but to human ears [...] Cannot without process of speech be told, [...] So told as earthly notion can receave. [...] Great triumph and rejoycing was in Heav'n [...] 180 [...] When such was heard declar'd the Almightie's will; [...] Glorie they sung to the most High, good will [...] To future men, and in thir dwellings peace: [...] Glorie to him whose just avenging ire [...] Had driven out th' ungodly from his sight [...] And th' habitations of the just; to him [...] Glorie and praise, whose wisdom had ordain'd [...] Good out of evil to create, in stead [...] Of Spirits maligne a better Race to bring [...] Into thir vacant room, and thence diffuse [...] 190 [...] His good to Worlds and Ages infinite. [...] So sang the Hierarchies: Mean while the Son [...] On his great Expedition now appeer'd, [...] Girt with Omnipotence, with Radiance crown'd [...] Of Majestie Divine, Sapience and Love [...] Immense, and all his Father in him shon. [...] About his Chariot numberless were pour'd [...] Cherub and Seraph, Potentates and Thrones, [...] And Vertues, winged Spirits, and Chariots wing'd, [...] From the Armoury of God, where stand of old [...] 200 [...] Myriads between two brazen Mountains lodg'd [...] Against a solemn day, harnest at hand, [...] Celestial Equipage; and now came forth [...] Spontaneous, for within them Spirit livd, [...] Attendant on thir Lord: Heav'n op'nd wide [...] Her ever during Gates, Harmonious sound [...] On golden Hinges moving, to let forth [...] The King of Glorie in his powerful Word [...] And Spirit coming to create new Worlds. [...] On heav'nly ground they stood, and from the shore [...] 210 [...] They view'd the vast immeasurable Abyss [...] Outrageous as a Sea, dark, wasteful, wilde, [...] Up from the bottom turn'd by furious windes [...] And surging waves, as Mountains to assault [...] Heav'ns highth, and with the Center mix the Pole. [...] Silence, ye troubl'd waves, and thou Deep, peace, [...] Said then th' Omnific Word, your discord end: [...] Nor staid, but on the Wings of Cherubim [...] Uplifted, in Paternal Glorie rode [...] Farr into Chaos, and the World unborn; [...] 220 [...] For Chaos heard his voice: him all his Traine [...] Follow'd in bright procession to behold [...] Creation, and the wonders of his might. [...] Then staid the fervid Wheeles, and in his hand [...] He took the golden Compasses, prepar'd [...] In Gods Eternal store, to circumscribe [...] This Universe, and all created things: [...] One foot he center'd, and the other turn'd [...] Round through the vast profunditie obscure, [...] And said, thus farr extend, thus farr thy bounds, [...] 230 [...] This be thy just Circumference, O World. [...] Thus God the Heav'n created, thus the Earth, [...] Matter unform'd and void: Darkness profound [...] Cover'd th' Abyss: but on the watrie calme [...] His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspred, [...] And vital vertue infus'd, and vital warmth [...] Throughout the fluid Mass, but downward purg'd [...] The black tartareous cold infernal dregs [...] Adverse to life: then founded, then conglob'd [...] Like things to like, the rest to several place [...] 240 [...] Disparted, and between spun out the Air, [...] And Earth self-ballanc't on her Center hung. [...] Let ther be Light, said God, and forthwith Light [...] Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure [...] Sprung from the Deep, and from her Native East [...] To journie through the airie gloom began, [...] Sphear'd in a radiant Cloud, for yet the Sun [...] Was not; shee in a cloudie Tabernacle [...] Sojourn'd the while. God saw the Light was good; [...] And light from darkness by the Hemisphere [...] 250 [...] Divided: Light the Day, and Darkness Night [...] He nam'd. Thus was the first Day Eev'n and Morn: [...] Nor past uncelebrated, nor unsung [...] By the Celestial Quires, when Orient Light [...] Exhaling first from Darkness they beheld; [...] Birth-day of Heav'n and Earth; with joy and shout [...] The hollow Universal Orb they fill'd, [...] And touch't thir Golden Harps, & hymning prais'd [...] God and his works, Creatour him they sung, [...] Both when first Eevning was, and when first Morn. [...] 260 [...] Again, God said, let ther be Firmament [...] Amid the Waters, and let it divide [...] The Waters from the Waters: and God made [...] The Firmament, expanse of liquid, pure, [...] Transparent, Elemental Air, diffus'd [...] In circuit to the uttermost convex [...] Of this great Round: partition firm and sure, [...] The Waters underneath from those above [...] Dividing: for as Earth, so hee the World [...] Built on circumfluous Waters calme, in wide [...] 270 [...] Crystallin Ocean, and the loud misrule [...] Of Chaos farr remov'd, least fierce extreames [...] Contiguous might distemper the whole frame: [...] And Heav'n he nam'd the Firmament: So Eev'n [...] And Morning Chorus sung the second Day. [...] The Earth was form'd, but in the Womb as yet [...] Of Waters, Embryon immature involv'd, [...] Appeer'd not: over all the face of Earth [...] Main Ocean flow'd, not idle, but with warme [...] Prolific humour soft'ning all her Globe, [...] 280 [...] Fermented the great Mother to conceave, [...] Satiate with genial moisture, when God said [...] Be gather'd now ye Waters under Heav'n [...] Into one place, and let dry Land appeer. [...] Immediately the Mountains huge appeer [...] Emergent, and thir broad bare backs upheave [...] Into the Clouds, thir tops ascend the Skie: [...] So high as heav'd the tumid Hills, so low [...] Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep, [...] Capacious bed of Waters: thither they [...] 290 [...] Hasted with glad precipitance, uprowld [...] As drops on dust conglobing from the drie; [...] Part rise in crystal Wall, or ridge direct, [...] For haste; such flight the great command impress'd [...] On the swift flouds: as Armies at the call [...] Of Trumpet (for of Armies thou hast heard) [...] Troop to thir Standard, so the watrie throng, [...] Wave rowling after Wave, where way they found, [...] If steep, with torrent rapture, if through Plaine, [...] Soft-ebbing; nor withstood them Rock or Hill, [...] 300 [...] But they, or under ground, or circuit wide [...] With Serpent errour wandring, found thir way, [...] And on the washie Oose deep Channels wore; [...] Easie, e're God had bid the ground be drie, [...] All but within those banks, where Rivers now [...] Stream, and perpetual draw thir humid traine. [...] The dry Land, Earth, and the great receptacle [...] Of congregated Waters he call'd Seas: [...] And saw that it was good, and said, Let th' Earth [...] Put forth the verdant Grass, Herb yeilding Seed, [...] 310 [...] And Fruit Tree yeilding Fruit after her kind; [...] Whose Seed is in her self upon the Earth. [...] He scarce had said, when the bare Earth, till then [...] Desert and bare, unsightly, unadorn'd, [...] Brought forth the tender Grass, whose verdure clad [...] Her Universal Face with pleasant green, [...] Then Herbs of every leaf, that sudden flour'd [...] Op'ning thir various colours, and made gay [...] Her bosom smelling sweet: and these scarce blown, [...] Forth flourish't thick the clustring Vine, forth crept [...] 320 [...] The smelling Gourd, up stood the cornie Reed [...] Embattell'd in her field: add the humble Shrub, [...] And Bush with frizl'd hair implicit: last [...] Rose as in Dance the stately Trees, and spred [...] Thir branches hung with copious Fruit; or gemm'd [...] Thir Blossoms: with high Woods the Hills were crownd, [...] With tufts the vallies & each fountain side, [...] With borders long the Rivers. That Earth now [...] Seemd like to Heav'n, a seat where Gods might dwell, [...] Or wander with delight, and love to haunt [...] 330 [...] Her sacred shades: though God had yet not rain'd [...] Upon the Earth, and man to till the ground [...] None was, but from the Earth a dewie Mist [...] Went up and waterd all the ground, and each [...] Plant of the field, which e're it was in the Earth [...] God made, and every Herb, before it grew [...] On the green stemm; God saw that it was good: [...] So Eev'n and Morn recorded the Third Day. [...] Again th' Almightie spake: Let there be Lights [...] High in th' expanse of Heaven to divide [...] 340 [...] The Day from Night; and let them be for Signes, [...] For Seasons, and for Dayes, and circling Years, [...] And let them be for Lights as I ordaine [...] Thir Office in the Firmament of Heav'n [...] To give Light on the Earth; and it was so. [...] And God made two great Lights, great for thir use [...] To Man, the greater to have rule by Day, [...] The less by Night alterne: and made the Starrs, [...] And set them in the Firmament of Heav'n [...] To illuminate the Earth, and rule the Day [...] 350 [...] In thir vicissitude, and rule the Night, [...] And Light from Darkness to divide. God saw, [...] Surveying his great Work, that it was good: [...] For of Celestial Bodies first the Sun [...] A mightie Spheare he fram'd, unlightsom first, [...] Though of Ethereal Mould: then form'd the Moon [...] Globose, and everie magnitude of Starrs, [...] And sowd with Starrs the Heav'n thick as a field: [...] Of Light by farr the greater part he took, [...] Transplanted from her cloudie Shrine, and plac'd [...] 360 [...] In the Suns Orb, made porous to receive [...] And drink the liquid Light, firm to retaine [...] Her gather'd beams, great Palace now of Light. [...] Hither as to thir Fountain other Starrs [...] Repairing, in thir gold'n Urns draw Light, [...] And hence the Morning Planet guilds his horns; [...] By tincture or reflection they augment [...] Thir small peculiar, though from human sight [...] So farr remote, with diminution seen. [...] First in his East the glorious Lamp was seen, [...] 370 [...] Regent of Day, and all th' Horizon round [...] Invested with bright Rayes, jocond to run [...] His Longitude through Heav'ns high rode: the gray [...] Dawn, and the Pleiades before him danc'd [...] Shedding sweet influence: less bright the Moon, [...] But opposite in leveld West was set [...] His mirror, with full face borrowing her Light [...] From him, for other light she needed none [...] In that aspect, and still that distance keepes [...] Till night, then in the East her turn she shines, [...] 380 [...] Revolvd on Heav'ns great Axle, and her Reign [...] With thousand lesser Lights dividual holds, [...] With thousand thousand Starres, that then appeer'd [...] Spangling the Hemisphere: then first adornd [...] With thir bright Luminaries that Set and Rose, [...] Glad Eevning & glad Morn crownd the fourth day. [...] And God said, let the Waters generate [...] Reptil with Spawn abundant, living Soule: [...] And let Fowle flie above the Earth, with wings [...] Displayd on the op'n Firmament of Heav'n. [...] 390 [...] And God created the great Whales, and each [...] Soul living, each that crept, which plenteously [...] The waters generated by thir kindes, [...] And every Bird of wing after his kinde; [...] And saw that it was good, and bless'd them, saying, [...] Be fruitful, multiply, and in the Seas [...] And Lakes and running Streams the waters fill; [...] And let the Fowle be multiply'd on the Earth. [...] Forthwith the Sounds and Seas, each Creek & Bay [...] With Frie innumerable swarme, and Shoales [...] 400 [...] Of Fish that with thir Finns & shining Scales [...] Glide under the green Wave, in Sculles that oft [...] Bank the mid Sea: part single or with mate [...] Graze the Sea weed thir pasture, & through Groves [...] Of Coral stray, or sporting with quick glance [...] Show to the Sun thir wav'd coats dropt with Gold, [...] Or in thir Pearlie shells at ease, attend [...] Moist nutriment, or under Rocks thir food [...] In jointed Armour watch: on smooth the Seale, [...] And bended Dolphins play: part huge of bulk [...] 410 [...] Wallowing unweildie, enormous in thir Gate [...] Tempest the Ocean: there Leviathan [...] Hugest of living Creatures, on the Deep [...] Stretcht like a Promontorie sleeps or swimmes, [...] And seems a moving Land, and at his Gilles [...] Draws in, and at his Trunck spouts out a Sea. [...] Mean while the tepid Caves, and Fens and shoares [...] Thir Brood as numerous hatch, from the Egg that soon [...] Bursting with kindly rupture forth disclos'd [...] Thir callow young, but featherd soon and fledge [...] 420 [...] They summ'd thir Penns, and soaring th' air sublime [...] With clang despis'd the ground, under a cloud [...] In prospect; there the Eagle and the Stork [...] On Cliffs and Cedar tops thir Eyries build: [...] Part loosly wing the Region, part more wise [...] In common, rang'd in figure wedge thir way, [...] Intelligent of seasons, and set forth [...] Thir Aierie Caravan high over Sea's [...] Flying, and over Lands with mutual wing [...] Easing thir flight; so stears the prudent Crane [...] 430 [...] Her annual Voiage, born on Windes; the Aire [...] Floats, as they pass, fann'd with unnumber'd plumes: [...] From Branch to Branch the smaller Birds with song [...] Solac'd the Woods, and spred thir painted wings [...] Till Ev'n, nor then the solemn Nightingal [...] Ceas'd warbling, but all night tun'd her soft layes: [...] Others on Silver Lakes and Rivers Bath'd [...] Thir downie Brest; the Swan with Arched neck [...] Between her white wings mantling proudly, Rowes [...] Her state with Oarie feet: yet oft they quit [...] 440 [...] The Dank, and rising on stiff Pennons, towre [...] The mid Aereal Skie: Others on ground [...] Walk'd firm; the crested Cock whose clarion sounds [...] The silent hours, and th' other whose gay Traine [...] Adorns him, colour'd with the Florid hue [...] Of Rainbows and Starrie Eyes. The Waters thus [...] With Fish replenisht, and the Aire with Fowle, [...] Ev'ning and Morn solemniz'd the Fift day. [...] The Sixt, and of Creation last arose [...] With Eevning Harps and Mattin, when God said, [...] 450 [...] Let th' Earth bring forth Fowle living in her kinde, [...] Cattel and Creeping things, and Beast of the Earth, [...] Each in their kinde. The Earth obey'd, and strait [...] Op'ning her fertil Woomb teem'd at a Birth [...] Innumerous living Creatures, perfet formes, [...] Limb'd and full grown: out of the ground up-rose [...] As from his Laire the wilde Beast where he wonns [...] In Forrest wilde, in Thicket, Brake, or Den; [...] Among the Trees in Pairs they rose, they walk'd: [...] The Cattel in the Fields and Meddowes green: [...] 460 [...] Those rare and solitarie, these in flocks [...] Pasturing at once, and in broad Herds upsprung: [...] The grassie Clods now Calv'd, now half appeer'd [...] The Tawnie Lion, pawing to get free [...] His hinder parts, then springs as broke from Bonds, [...] And Rampant shakes his Brinded main; the Ounce, [...] The Libbard, and the Tyger, as the Moale [...] Rising, the crumbl'd Earth above them threw [...] In Hillocks; the swift Stag from under ground [...] Bore up his branching head: scarse from his mould [...] 470 [...] Behemoth biggest born of Earth upheav'd [...] His vastness: Fleec't the Flocks and bleating rose, [...] As Plants: ambiguous between Sea and Land [...] The River Horse and scalie Crocodile. [...] At once came forth whatever creeps the ground, [...] Insect or Worme; those wav'd thir limber fans [...] For wings, and smallest Lineaments exact [...] In all the Liveries dect of Summers pride [...] With spots of Gold and Purple, azure and green: [...] These as a line thir long dimension drew, [...] 480 [...] Streaking the ground with sinuous trace; not all [...] Minims of Nature; some of Serpent kinde [...] Wondrous in length and corpulence involv'd [...] Thir Snakie foulds, and added wings. First crept [...] The Parsimonious Emmet, provident [...] Of future, in small room large heart enclos'd, [...] Pattern of just equalitie perhaps [...] Hereafter, join'd in her popular Tribes [...] Of Commonaltie: swarming next appeer'd [...] The Femal Bee that feeds her Husband Drone [...] 490 [...] Deliciously, and builds her waxen Cells [...] With Honey stor'd: the rest are numberless, [...] And thou thir Natures know'st, and gav'st them Names, [...] Needlest to thee repeated; nor unknown [...] The Serpent suttl'st Beast of all the field, [...] Of huge extent somtimes, with brazen Eyes [...] And hairie Main terrific, though to thee [...] Not noxious, but obedient at thy call. [...] Now Heav'n in all her Glorie shon, and rowld [...] Her motions, as the great first-Movers hand [...] 500 [...] First wheeld thir course; Earth in her rich attire [...] Consummate lovly smil'd; Aire, Water, Earth, [...] By Fowl, Fish, Beast, was flown, was swum, was walkt [...] Frequent; and of the Sixt day yet remain'd; [...] There wanted yet the Master work, the end [...] Of all yet don; a Creature who not prone [...] And Brute as other Creatures, but endu'd [...] With Sanctitie of Reason, might erect [...] His Stature, and upright with Front serene [...] Govern the rest, self-knowing, and from thence [...] 510 [...] Magnanimous to correspond with Heav'n, [...] But grateful to acknowledge whence his good [...] Descends, thither with heart and voice and eyes [...] Directed in Devotion, to adore [...] And worship God Supream, who made him chief [...] Of all his works: therefore the Omnipotent [...] Eternal Father (For where is not hee [...] Present) thus to his Son audibly spake. [...] Let us make now Man in our image, Man [...] In our similitude, and let them rule [...] 520 [...] Over the Fish and Fowle of Sea and Aire, [...] Beast of the Field, and over all the Earth, [...] And every creeping thing that creeps the ground. [...] This said, he formd thee, Adam, thee O Man [...] Dust of the ground, and in thy nostrils breath'd [...] The breath of Life; in his own Image hee [...] Created thee, in the Image of God [...] Express, and thou becam'st a living Soul. [...] Male he created thee, but thy consort [...] Femal for Race; then bless'd Mankinde, and said, [...] 530 [...] Be fruitful, multiplie, and fill the Earth, [...] Subdue it, and throughout Dominion hold [...] Over Fish of the Sea, and Fowle of the Aire, [...] And every living thing that moves on the Earth. [...] Wherever thus created, for no place [...] Is yet distinct by name, thence, as thou know'st [...] He brought thee into this delicious Grove, [...] This Garden, planted with the Trees of God, [...] Delectable both to behold and taste; [...] And freely all thir pleasant fruit for food [...] 540 [...] Gave thee, all sorts are here that all th' Earth yeelds, [...] Varietie without end; but of the Tree [...] Which tasted works knowledge of Good and Evil, [...] Thou mai'st not; in the day thou eat'st, thou di'st; [...] Death is the penaltie impos'd, beware, [...] And govern well thy appetite, least sin [...] Surprise thee, and her black attendant Death. [...] Here finish'd hee, and all that he had made [...] View'd, and behold all was entirely good; [...] So Ev'n and Morn accomplish'd the Sixt day: [...] 550 [...] Yet not till the Creator from his work [...] Desisting, though unwearied, up returnd [...] Up to the Heav'n of Heav'ns his high abode, [...] Thence to behold this new created World [...] Th' addition of his Empire, how it shew'd [...] In prospect from his Throne, how good, how faire, [...] Answering his great Idea. Up he rode [...] Followd with acclamation and the sound [...] Symphonious of ten thousand Harpes that tun'd [...] Angelic harmonies: the Earth, the Aire [...] 560 [...] Resounded, (thou remember'st, for thou heardst) [...] The Heav'ns and all the Constellations rung, [...] The Planets in thir stations list'ning stood, [...] While the bright Pomp ascended jubilant. [...] Open, ye everlasting Gates, they sung, [...] Open, ye Heav'ns, your living dores; let in [...] The great Creator from his work returnd [...] Magnificent, his Six days work, a World; [...] Open, and henceforth oft; for God will deigne [...] To visit oft the dwellings of just Men [...] 570 [...] Delighted, and with frequent intercourse [...] Thither will send his winged Messengers [...] On errands of supernal Grace. So sung [...] The glorious Train ascending: He through Heav'n, [...] That open'd wide her blazing Portals, led [...] To Gods Eternal house direct the way, [...] A broad and ample rode, whose dust is Gold [...] And pavement Starrs, as Starrs to thee appeer, [...] Seen in the Galaxie, that Milkie way [...] Which nightly as a circling Zone thou seest [...] 580 [...] Pouderd with Starrs. And now on Earth the Seaventh [...] Eev'ning arose in Eden, for the Sun [...] Was set, and twilight from the East came on, [...] Forerunning Night; when at the holy mount [...] Of Heav'ns high-seated top, th' Impereal Throne [...] Of Godhead, fixt for ever firm and sure, [...] The Filial Power arriv'd, and sate him down [...] With his great Father (for he also went [...] Invisible, yet staid (such priviledge [...] Hath Omnipresence) and the work ordain'd, [...] 590 [...] Author and end of all things, and from work [...] Now resting, bless'd and hallowd the Seav'nth day, [...] As resting on that day from all his work, [...] But not in silence holy kept; the Harp [...] Had work and rested not, the solemn Pipe, [...] And Dulcimer, all Organs of sweet stop, [...] All sounds on Fret by String or Golden Wire [...] Temper'd soft Tunings, intermixt with Voice [...] Choral or Unison: of incense Clouds [...] Fuming from Golden Censers hid the Mount. [...] 600 [...] Creation and the Six dayes acts they sung, [...] Great are thy works, Jehovah, infinite [...] Thy power; what thought can measure thee or tongue [...] Relate thee; greater now in thy return [...] Then from the Giant Angels; thee that day [...] Thy Thunders magnifi'd; but to create [...] Is greater then created to destroy. [...] Who can impair thee, mighty King, or bound [...] Thy Empire? easily the proud attempt [...] Of Spirits apostat and thir Counsels vaine [...] 610 [...] Thou hast repeld, while impiously they thought [...] Thee to diminish, and from thee withdraw [...] The number of thy worshippers. Who seekes [...] To lessen thee, against his purpose serves [...] To manifest the more thy might: his evil [...] Thou usest, and from thence creat'st more good. [...] Witness this new-made World, another Heav'n [...] From Heaven Gate not farr, founded in view [...] On the cleer Hyaline, the Glassie Sea; [...] Of amplitude almost immense, with Starr's [...] 620 [...] Numerous, and every Starr perhaps a World [...] Of destind habitation; but thou know'st [...] Thir seasons: among these the seat of men, [...] Earth with her nether Ocean circumfus'd, [...] Thir pleasant dwelling place. Thrice happie men, [...] And sons of men, whom God hath thus advanc't, [...] Created in his Image, there to dwell [...] And worship him, and in reward to rule [...] Over his Works, on Earth, in Sea, or Air, [...] And multiply a Race of Worshippers [...] 630 [...] Holy and just: thrice happie if they know [...] Thir happiness, and persevere upright. [...] So sung they, and the Empyrean rung, [...] With Halleluiahs: Thus was Sabbath kept. [...] And thy request think now fulfill'd, that ask'd [...] How first this World and face of things began, [...] And what before thy memorie was don [...] From the beginning, that posteritie [...] Informd by thee might know; if else thou seekst [...] Aught, not surpassing human measure, say.
