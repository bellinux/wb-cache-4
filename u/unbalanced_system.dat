50|$|In practice, systems {{rarely have}} {{perfectly}} balanced loads, currents, voltages and impedances {{in all three}} phases. The analysis of unbalanced cases is greatly simplified {{by the use of}} the techniques of symmetrical components. An <b>unbalanced</b> <b>system</b> is analysed as the superposition of three balanced systems, each with the positive, negative or zero sequence of balanced voltages.|$|E

50|$|When the {{currents}} {{on the three}} live wires of a three-phase system are not equal or are not at an exact 120° phase angle, the power loss is greater than for a perfectly balanced system. The method of symmetrical components is used to analyze <b>unbalanced</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R

50|$|In game design, {{balance is}} the concept and the {{practice}} of tuning a game's rules, usually with the goal of preventing any of its component systems from being ineffective or otherwise undesirable when compared to their peers.

5000|$|Other {{cultures}} have developed different naturalistic disease theories. One specific example lies in Latin cultures, which place [...] "hot" [...] or [...] "cold" [...] classifications {{on things like}} food, drink, and environmental conditions. They believe {{that the combination of}} hot and cold substances will cause an <b>unbalanced</b> <b>system</b> that leads to disease. Therefore, one is expected not to have a cold drink after taking a hot bath.|$|E
50|$|In an <b>unbalanced</b> <b>system</b> {{there will}} always be favoured {{circuits}} that receive more water than they require. These favoured circuits steal flow from unfavoured circuits which will not then be able to provide the heating or cooling required. Control valves may temporarily help by gradually reducing the flow in favoured circuits, thus allowing unfavoured circuits to achieve the correct flow. This will however cause long delays in reaching the set temperature in the building after night setback and will make the installation very inefficient.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- Active power filters play an {{important}} role when power quality is concerned. Shunt active power filters are used for filtering harmonic and reactive currents in electric systems driving nonlinear and reactive loads. These filters permit the reduction of power losses, electromagnetic interferences and other problems that may arise from the existence of excessive harmonic and reactive currents in electric systems. This research presents a current controller with three-dimensional (3 -D) space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) for active power filters used in four-wire <b>unbalanced</b> <b>systems.</b> Many techniques of current control are widely known for three-wire balanced systems but very few works explain current control techniques for <b>unbalanced</b> <b>systems</b> with a neutral conductor. This paper explains in detail a four-wire current controller using a conventional three-leg voltage source inverter and makes a comparison of its performance with the performance of the well-known hysteresis-based current controller...|$|R

50|$|When {{using the}} method of {{symmetrical}} components, separate one-line diagrams are made {{for each of the}} positive, negative and zero-sequence systems. This simplifies the analysis of unbalanced conditions of a polyphase system. Items that have different impedances for the different phase sequences are identified on the diagrams. For example, in general a generator will have different positive and negative sequence impedance, and certain transformer winding connections block zero-sequence currents. The <b>unbalanced</b> <b>system</b> can be resolved into three single line diagrams for each sequence, and interconnected to show how the unbalanced components add in each part of the system.|$|E
50|$|When an <b>unbalanced</b> <b>system</b> is rotating, {{periodic}} linear and/or torsional {{forces are}} generated which are {{perpendicular to the}} axis of rotation. The periodic nature of these forces is commonly experienced as vibration. These off-axis vibration forces may exceed the design limits of individual machine elements, reducing the service life of these parts. For instance, a bearing may be subjected to perpendicular torsion forces that would not occur in a nominally balanced system, or the instantaneous linear forces may exceed {{the limits of the}} bearing. Such excessive forces will cause failure in bearings in short time periods. Shafts with unbalanced masses can be bent by the forces and experience fatigue failure.|$|E

The book, and his previous work, has argued that there is no difference between poor readers and dyslexic people; dyslexia is a 'useless term' and a 'meaningless label' that should be discontinued. It also suggested that the diagnosis was being misused by middle-class parents to get additional support for their children, and that state schools are much less inclined to make a diagnosis because the pressures it would put on their limited budgets.

40|$|Photovoltaic (PV) {{power is}} a {{favorable}} source of clean energy, which can be easily integrated into distribution systems, next to loads. However, to meet a considerable load portion of the system a high penetration level of PV is required.

40|$|Abstract—To {{minimize}} power losses, it {{is important}} to determine the location and size of local generators to be placed in <b>unbalanced</b> power distribution <b>systems.</b> On account of some inherent features of <b>unbalanced</b> distribution <b>systems,</b> such as radial structure, large number of nodes, a wide range of X/R ratios, the conventional techniques developed for the transmission systems generally fail on the determination of optimum size and location of distributed generators (DGs). This paper presents a simple method for investigating the problem of contemporaneously choosing best location and size of DG in three-phase <b>unbalanced</b> radial distribution <b>system</b> (URDS) for power loss minimization and to improve the voltage profile of the system. Best location of the DG is determined by using voltage index analysis and size of DG is computed by variational technique algorithm according to available standard size of DGs.

5000|$|These {{corrections}} did {{not address}} a grossly <b>unbalanced</b> <b>system</b> that clearly favored the employers. This caused the continuation of strikes and the first major industrial strike in Russia, which occurred in the year 1870 in St. Petersburg. [...] This new phenomenon was a catalyst to many more strikes in Russia, which increased until they reached a peak between 1884 and 1885 when 4,000 workers went on strike at Morozov's cotton mill. [...] This large strike prompted officials to consider regulations that would restrain the abuses of employers and ensure safety in the work place. A new law was passed in 1886 that required employers to specify working conditions in their factories in writing. This included {{the treatment of the}} workers, the workers' hours, and the safety precautions that were taken by the employer. This new law also created factory inspectors who were charged with preserving industrial peace. Despite these changes, strike activity again reached high proportions during the 1890s, resulting in the restriction of the workday to eleven and a half hours in 1897.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, the {{concepts}} related to loss partitioning among the phase currents in three-phase distribution systems are revisited {{in the light}} of new findings identified by the authors. In particular, the presence of a paradox in the classical loss partitioning approach, based {{on the use of the}} phase-by-phase difference between the input and output complex power, is high-lighted. The conditions for performing effective loss partitioning without the occurrence of the paradox are thus established. The corresponding results are then used to extend the branch current decomposition loss allocation method for enabling its application to three-phase <b>unbalanced</b> distribution <b>systems</b> with distributed generation. Several numerical examples on a three-phase line with grounded neutral and on the modified IEEE 13 -node test system are provided to assist the illustration and discussion of the novel conceptual framework.
