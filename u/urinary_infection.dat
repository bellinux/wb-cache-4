5|$|Oil spills {{present a}} {{localized}} threat to otter populations, especially in coastal areas. Water pollution and other diminution of aquatic and wetland habitats may limit distribution and pose long-term threats if {{the enforcement of}} water quality standards is not upheld. Acid drainage from coal mines is a persistent water quality issue in some areas, as it eliminates otter prey. This dilemma prevents, and consequently inhibits, recolonization or growth of otter populations. Recently, long-term genetic consequences of reintroduction projects on remnant otter populations has been discussed. Similarly, many perceived threats to otters, such as pollution and habitat alterations, have not been rigorously evaluated. Little effort has gone into assessing the threat of disease to wild river otter populations, so it is poorly understood and documented. River otters may be victims of canine distemper, rabies, respiratory tract disease, and <b>urinary</b> <b>infection.</b> In addition, North American river otters can contract jaundice, hepatitis, feline panleucopenia, and pneumonia. They host numerous endoparasites, such as nematodes, cestodes, trematodes, the sporozoan Isopora, and acanthocephalans. Ectoparasites include ticks, sucking lice(Latagophthirus rauschi), and fleas (Oropsylla arctomys).|$|E

25|$|The classic {{presentation}} (in 40–50% of the cases) is episodic hematuria, {{which usually}} starts {{within a day}} or two of a non-specific upper respiratory tract infection (hence synpharyngitic), as opposed to post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, which occurs some time (weeks) after initial infection. Less commonly gastrointestinal or <b>urinary</b> <b>infection</b> can be the inciting agent. All of these infections have in common the activation of mucosal defenses and hence IgA antibody production. Groin pain can also occur. The gross hematuria resolves after a few days, though microscopic hematuria may persist. These episodes occur on an irregular basis every few months and in most patients eventually subsides, although it can take many years. Renal function usually remains normal, though rarely, acute kidney failure may occur (see below). This presentation is more common in younger adults.|$|E

When carbon dioxide approaches dangerous levels, ground control must quickly invent a way to make the Command Module's square filters work in the Lunar Module's round receptacles. With the guidance systems on Aquarius shut down, the crew must make a difficult but vital course correction by manually igniting the Lunar Module's engine.|$|E

In 1658 he was struck by a sudden bout of malarial fever, followed directly by illness symptomatic of a urinary or kidney complaint. The Venetian ambassador, who wrote regular dispatches to the Doge of Venice in which he included details of Cromwell's final illness, was suspicious of the rapidity of Cromwell's death. The decline may also have been hastened by the death of one of his daughters, Elizabeth Claypole, in August. He died aged 59 at Whitehall on Friday 3 September 1658, the anniversary of his great victories at Dunbar and Worcester.

40|$|Purpose: Objective {{diagnosis}} of symptomatic <b>urinary</b> tract <b>infections</b> in patients prone to asymptomatic bacteriuria is compromised by local host responses {{that are already}} present and the positive urine culture. We investigated interleukin- 6 as a biomarker for nonfebrile <b>urinary</b> tract <b>infection</b> severity and diagnostic thresholds for interleukin- 6 and 8, and neutrophils to differentiate between asymptomatic bacteriuria and <b>urinary</b> tract <b>infection.</b> Materials and Methods: Patients with residual urine and neurogenic bladders due to spinal lesions included in a long-term Escherichia coli 83972 asymptomatic bacteriuria inoculation trial were monitored for 2 years. Symptom scoring and urine sampling to estimate interleukin- 6 and 8, and neutrophils were performed regularly monthly and at <b>urinary</b> tract <b>infection</b> episodes. Results: Patients were followed in the complete study for a mean of 19 months (range 10 to 27) and those with asymptomatic bacteriuria with E. coli 83972 were followed a mean of 11 months (range 4 to 19). A total of 37 nonfebrile <b>urinary</b> tract <b>infection</b> episodes with complete data on interleukin- 6 and 8, neutrophils and symptom scoring were documented. Interleukin- 6 was the only marker that persistently increased during <b>urinary</b> tract <b>infection</b> compared to asymptomatic bacteriuria in pooled and paired intra-individual comparisons (p < 0. 05). Interleukin- 6 above the threshold (greater than 25 ng/l) correlated to more severe <b>urinary</b> tract <b>infection</b> symptoms (p < 0. 05). The sensitivity and specificity of all biomarkers were poor/moderate when differentiating asymptomatic bacteriuria vs all <b>urinary</b> tract <b>infection</b> episodes. However, in <b>urinary</b> tract <b>infections</b> with worse symptoms interleukin- 6 and neutrophils demonstrated equal good/excellent outcomes. Conclusions: Triggered interleukin- 6 correlated to <b>urinary</b> tract <b>infection</b> symptom severity and demonstrated a promising differential diagnostic capacity to discriminate <b>urinary</b> tract <b>infection</b> from asymptomatic bacteriuria. Future studies should explore interleukin- 6 as a biomarker of <b>urinary</b> tract <b>infection</b> severity and assess the treatment indication in nonfebrile <b>urinary</b> tract <b>infections...</b>|$|R

The objective {{of the study is}} to assess the surface expression of CXCR 1 and CXCR 2 and the existence of polymorphisms in the CXCR 1 gene in premenopausal women with recurrent <b>urinary</b> tract <b>infections.</b> The study included 20 premenopausal women with recurrent <b>urinary</b> <b>infections,</b> with normal <b>urinary</b> tracts, and without diseases potentially associated with relapsing <b>urinary</b> <b>infections</b> and 30 controls without previous <b>urinary</b> <b>infections.</b> The levels of CXCR 1 and CXCR 2 expression on neutrophils were measured and analyzed by flow cytometry by measuring the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) channel. The promoter and coding regions of the CXCR 1 gene were analyzed for the presence of polymorphisms by a sequence-based typing method. Patients with recurrent <b>urinary</b> tract <b>infections</b> exhibited median levels of CXCR 1 expression, determined from MFI values, {{similar to those of the}} controls. The analysis of CXCR 2 showed that patients with recurrent <b>urinary</b> <b>infections</b> had lower median levels of expression, determined from the MFI values, than the controls (P = 0. 002, Mann-Whitney U test). No polymorphisms were detected at the promoter or at the exon 1 region of the CXCR 1 gene either in the patients or in the controls. Polymorphisms were detected at the exon 2 of CXCR 1, but their frequencies did not differ between patients and controls. We have found a low level of CXCR 2 expression in patients with recurrent <b>urinary</b> tract <b>infections.</b> These results suggest that a low level of CXCR 2 expression may increase the susceptibilities of premenopausal women to <b>urinary</b> tract <b>infections...</b>|$|R
