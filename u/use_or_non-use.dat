25|$|The {{pitch is}} said to be covered when the groundsmen have placed covers on it to protect it against rain or dew. The <b>use</b> <b>or</b> <b>non-use</b> of covers {{significantly}} affects the way the ball comes off the pitch, making the matter potentially controversial. Law 11 of the Laws of Cricket provides that during the match the pitch shall not be completely covered unless provided otherwise by regulations or by agreement before the toss. When possible, the bowlers' run ups are covered in inclement weather to keep them dry. If the pitch is covered overnight, the covers are removed in the morning at the earliest possible moment on each day that play is expected to take place. If covers are used during the day as protection from inclement weather or if inclement weather delays the removal of overnight covers, they are removed as soon as conditions allow. Excess water can be removed from a pitch or the outfield using a machine called a water hog.|$|E
25|$|Many local {{variants}} of the Greek alphabet {{were employed in}} ancient Greece during the archaic and early classical periods, until they were replaced by the classical 24-letter alphabet that is the standard today, around 400 BC. All forms of the Greek alphabet were originally based on the shared inventory of the 22 symbols of the Phoenician alphabet, {{with the exception of}} the letter Samekh, whose Greek counterpart Xi (Ξ) was used only in a sub-group of Greek alphabets, and with the common addition of Upsilon (Υ) for the vowel /u, ū/. The local, so-called epichoric, alphabets differed in many ways: in the use of the consonant symbols Χ, Φ and Ψ; in the use of the innovative long vowel letters (Ω and Η), in the absence or presence of Η in its original consonant function (/h/); in the <b>use</b> <b>or</b> <b>non-use</b> of certain archaic letters (Ϝ = /w/, Ϙ = /k/, Ϻ = /s/); and in many details of the individual shapes of each letter. The system now familiar as the standard 24-letter Greek alphabet was originally the regional variant of the Ionian cities in Asia Minor. It was officially adopted in Athens in 403 BC and in most of the rest of the Greek world by the middle of the 4th century BC.|$|E

Based as it is on one of the first qualitative studies of home use of the internet and what appears to be the earliest Australian study of home use of the internet, it helps to fill a gap in the history of the internet in Australia. It draws from 76 in-depth interviews conducted in 1998 with members of nineteen household families who had a home internet connection. At the time of the research, there were a variety of stories in circulation regarding the relationship between the internet and gender The analysis presented in this article presents a more nuanced picture of this relationship in the early days of domestic internet connections. Rather than just comparing the different experiences of males and females, it looks at how gender was constituted in the meanings users invested in particular <b>uses</b> <b>or</b> <b>non-uses</b> of the internet at home, and in particular in the idea of technical mastery...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} the results from a survey {{about the use of}} assessment instruments conducted among Norwegian occupational therapists in December 2013. The purpose of the present study, sub-study number 4, was to explore how occupational therapists reason about their use of assessments and evaluation instruments. Of the 1286 respondents in the survey, 349 reasoned about their <b>use</b> of <b>or</b> <b>non-use</b> of assessments. This article is based on these reported reasons. The motives are analyzed using thematic analysis. The analyses brought forward four themes that were consistent in the material: (i) Systematic use of assessments supports the choice of therapeutic goals and -interventions, (ii) use of assessments may facilitate client-centered practice, (iii) use of assessments may develop occupational therapists’ qualifications in communicating occupational therapy, (iv) factors that hinder the use of assessments. Based on the results we conclude that the professional practice within occupational therapy is on its way towards a knowledge-based practice. There are still inhibiting factors in applying assessments in occupational therapy practice, and evidence-based practice may be facilitated by strengthening occupational therapists’ knowledge and skills in performing formal assessment...|$|R
40|$|Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) habitat was {{studied in}} central Montana {{primarily}} on Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt. ssp. wyomingensis Beetle and Young) dominated rangeland. The primary {{objective was to}} compare shrub and herbaceous parameters within (<b>use,</b> random <b>or</b> <b>non-use)</b> and between seasonal habitats (nest, brood, winter). Two study sites (Musselshell and Golden Valley counties), and 2 years (2004 and 2005) were compared. Nest, brood, and random sites were compared for herbaceous cover, and grass height. Nest, brood, random, winter use and winter non-use sites were evaluated for shrub cover, density, and height. All differences were considered significant at P ≤ 0. 05. Sage-grouse nested in areas with greater total shrub cover and height, and taller live and residual grass than was randomly available. No {{differences were found between}} brood and paired random sites for any of the herbaceous or shrub parameters measured. Shrub cover and density were greater at winter use sites than non-use sites. Winter use sites had less shrub cover than nest sites. The nest and brood habitat had similar shrub cover, density, and height on the study area. Sage-grouse habitats should be managed to include sagebrush, forbs, and grass. Herbaceous vegetation was more important during nesting and brood rearing than during the winter. Therefore, some portions of grouse habitat may benefit from management for greater herbaceous cover, but never at the sake of less sagebrush.

40|$|Thesis (M. Comm.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2004. Midmar {{is built}} on the Umgeni River, KwaZulu-Natal and is 1060 m above sea level. The river starts as a small stream in Loteni and has a total {{catchment}} area of 906 square kilometres and an annual rainfall of 1016 mm. Midmar provides a multitude of benefits classified as either onsite <b>use</b> benefits <b>or</b> <b>non-use</b> benefits. This dissertation focuses on environmental economics and is concerned with assigning a monetary value to a given environmental good, namely, recreation at Midmar. This entails estimation of the demand curve for recreation at Midmar, and using this curve, establishing the consumer surplus attached to Midmar. The Individual Travel Cost method is used to investigate the nature of recreational demand at Midmar and essentially, measures the economic value of recreation use here. In addition, an examination as to whether consumers enjoy any consumer surplus associated with recreational demand is undertaken. The survey undertaken concludes that recreational visitors to Midmar enjoy a consumer surplus of approximately R 71 per visit. Total consumer surplus for Midmar during 1999 {{was estimated to be}} R 4. 9 million. This suggests that the actual price paid by visitors to Midmar understates the true value attached to such a visit and hence, park management needs to be aware of this. Finally, this dissertation emphasizes the importance and potential use of research such as this which could assist and guide future planning and decision making in South Africa...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{this article}} is to present the reader with an {{accessible}} and practical account of evaluation as a mode of inquiry within the broad domain of social science. The starting point is the presentation of a general outline of the main milestones relating to the emergence of evaluation as a mode of inquiry and some of the prominent advocates of contemporary evaluation. Particular attention is directed towards what is termed as ‘programme evaluation’. Then the author endeavours to explore whether evaluation as a mode of inquiry is practice or theory led. A definitive answer to this question is not presented here in this short article; instead, the author makes assumptions based on his interpretation of the reviewed discourse within the field and personal reflection from practice. The case of the European University Association’s quality review of the seven Irish universities and the Dublin Institute of Technology is cited as an example of evaluation in practice in the Irish higher education sector. Issues such as the politics and power, decision making, and the <b>use,</b> misuse <b>or</b> <b>non-use</b> of findings of evaluations are briefly introduced. A long shadow has fallen across the United States. The American tradition of open government is being seriously eroded. We have a regime in Washington under President George Bush that strives to control information beyond anything in my experience. Of course, all governments hide their mistakes and misdeeds and spin news to their advantage. Of course. But I am talking about control of information that threatens evaluation – and perhaps democracy. (House, 2006, p. 119) [1...|$|R

This endeavor is enacted through the prism of anthropological linguisticsas it is posited closer to the cultural domain in which the language is employed. This actuallycan be seen from another sub-field of linguistics, sociolinguistics. So as to refrain fromoverlapping, a simple definition of anthropological linguistics is worth mentioning to reaffirmhat the discussion is on the right track. Anthropological linguistics (Foley, 2001) viewsanguage through the prism of the core anthropological concept, culture, and, as such, seekso unveil the meaning behind the <b>use,</b> misuse <b>or</b> <b>non-use</b> of language, its different forms,registers, and styles.

Likewise, this means toscrutinize its typical language patterns mostly preceded by the word ―Ojo‖ such as OjoKagetan, Ojo Gumunan, Ojo Dumeh, etc. The three expressions, for instance, are veryrelevant to represent the current state of affairs which long for peacefulness, prosperity, andwisdom. The data of such kind are obtained from interview with the sample of twenty culturelliterate Javanese people chosen purposively. The data are analyzed based upon twofold:ogical meaning and moral values. Hence, the finding shows that Javanese language is worthmaintaining and developing constantly as it preserves invaluable treasure.

40|$|In {{the past}} years, {{scholars}} have assessed the social differences that the Internet has generated from its <b>use</b> (<b>or</b> its <b>non-use).</b> The {{issue has been}} largely referred to as Digital Divide, describing the social division between those who are using the technology {{and those who are}} not; or in other words, the "haves" and "have nots" of the Internet. Generally, the phenomenon has been explained from a perspective in which infrastructural and demographics aspects are considered as the main barriers to overcome in order to narrow this digital inequality. Albeit partially true, this trend of research does not consider people's perceptions toward the Internet and how they can also explain connectivity, or lack thereof. Analyzing data from 1) the 55 th Eurobarometer collected by the EU Commission (N = 16, 134); and 2) data collected from the National Statistical Institutes of each State Member of the European Union, this paper suggests that there is a necessity to approach the problem from another perspective. This {{does not mean that the}} other trend was wrong, but rather, one explanation of the problem is not enough. Thus, this research enlightens how psychological barriers are involved in impeding EU citizens' complete adoption of the Internet. For instance, perceptions of what opportunities were missed by not accessing the WWW, perceptions of the kind of content that should be on the Net and perceptions of how the Internet would change their daily lives were all factors that indicated that not only demographical or structural obstacles were involved. In a sense, people do not think that they are missing many Job-Training, Consumption or improvement of Social Integration opportunities by not being connected to the Internet. In addition, the content that should be available over the Net is not appealing enough to induce them to seek out Internet access...|$|R
