50|$|However, it is {{important}} to note that if an alien voluntarily departs at this stage, <b>unlawful</b> <b>presence</b> accrued up to that point is part of the alien's immigration record, and may create bars to re-entry depending on the length of <b>unlawful</b> <b>presence.</b> In particular, if the alien believes that his or her presence was not unlawful, or the alien believes that he or she may be eligible for some relief from removal (such as cancellation of removal or asylum) or may be eligible for Adjustment of Status despite <b>unlawful</b> <b>presence</b> (for instance, through the Legal Immigration Family Equity Act), then voluntary departure could be a bad choice from the alien's perspective.

50|$|Deferred {{inspection}} is {{a procedure}} in immigration enforcement in the United States for Arriving Aliens. Here, {{the final decision}} on whether to admit the Arriving Alien, instead of being conducted at the port of entry where the alien arrived, is deferred to be carried out later at a deferred inspection site, while the alien is paroled into the United States. The guidelines followed at the deferred inspection site are largely the same as those followed by the officers at the port of entry, and are described in the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Inspector's Field Manual. Aliens do not accrue <b>unlawful</b> <b>presence</b> between the time of arrival and the date of deferred inspection, but they do begin to accrue <b>unlawful</b> <b>presence</b> after their parole ends, if they are not successfully admitted at the deferred inspection site by then.

50|$|Like {{withdrawal}} of {{application for admission}} and voluntary return, voluntary departure requires the alien to leave the United States, but does not put a removal order on the alien's record, thereby avoiding the bars to entry that a removal order would create. However, voluntary departure differs from the other processes in that its scope is not merely limited to arriving aliens. It can also apply to aliens who were admitted to the United States lawfully or entered unlawfully. Any days of <b>unlawful</b> <b>presence</b> acquired are not removed if the alien undergoes voluntary departure.|$|E
5000|$|In United States {{immigration}} law, {{voluntary departure}} {{is a process}} where an alien (usually one in removal proceedings, due to either <b>unlawful</b> <b>presence</b> or some other reason for removability) chooses {{to return to his}} or her home country, and in return, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security does not put a removal order for the person. Voluntary departure requires the consent both of the alien and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security officers in charge of the alien, and has been called a [...] "privilege" [...] rather than a right.|$|E
5000|$|Under {{what came}} to be known as the [...] "PRUCOL" [...] doctrine, expounded by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Holley v. Lavine, even an alien who was unquestionably present in the United States {{contrary}} to law could be PRUCOL. In the statutes defining eligibility criteria for federal benefits, the U.S. Congress provided for payment of benefits, not only to lawful immigrants, but to aliens [...] "permanently residing under color of law." [...] Thus, if the USCIS is aware of the alien's <b>unlawful</b> <b>presence,</b> but was not actively pursuing his or her deportation, the alien is eligible for benefits. Under this doctrine aliens with no legal right to remain in the United States are nevertheless eligible for public assistance.|$|E
5000|$|There is {{a related}} process called {{voluntary}} return or, in more formal parlance, administrative voluntary departure. This {{refers to a}} case where an alien is stopped from entering at a land border (by United States Border Patrol) and agrees to voluntarily return instead of undergoing expedited removal. A key difference between voluntary departure and voluntary return {{is that in the}} case of voluntary return, the alien never enters the United States, and therefore accrues no <b>unlawful</b> <b>presence.</b> The time between the alien arriving at the port and agreeing to return voluntarily can vary between a few hours and a few days, and throughout that duration the alien is under the supervision of either U.S. Customs and Border Protection or the carrier. Nonetheless, a number of commentators use the term voluntary return to refer to both voluntary departure and voluntary return. To add to the confusion, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement uses the term [...] "return" [...] when reporting the number of voluntary departures.|$|E
5000|$|In October 2012, the Michigan Secretary of State, Ruth Johnson, {{announced}} that Michigan will not issue drivers licenses or state identification {{of any kind}} to beneficiaries of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. In making this decision, {{it was clear that}} the Secretary of State erroneously conflated the notion of [...] "lawful presence," [...] which is required under Michigan Law to issue a driver's license, and [...] "lawful status," [...] a different legal concept entirely. USCIS has made it clear that DACA beneficiaries do not possess legal status, but does not state that DACA beneficiaries are unlawfully present; in fact, it states that DACA beneficiaries will not accrue <b>unlawful</b> <b>presence</b> time here while they are in this deferred action status. [...] The Secretary of State relied upon USCIS' own explanation, which discusses legal status, not lawful presence. In response to this policy, the ACLU filed a lawsuit against Johnson, alleging that the policy violated both Michigan law and the U.S. Constitution. On January 18, 2013, USCIS updated their [...] "Frequently Asked Questions" [...] page about DACA, clarifying, among other things, that DACA beneficiaries are, in fact, lawfully present in the United States. On 1 February 2013, Johnson reversed her policy and began issuing drivers licenses to DACA beneficiaries on February 19, 2013.|$|E
50|$|While NGO {{trafficking}} shelters provide {{resources that}} government shelters do not, {{the government does}} not provide any financial assistance to NGOs, and requires all identified victims to reside in its own shelters. The anti-trafficking law provides immunity to trafficking victims for immigration offences such as illegal entry, <b>unlawful</b> <b>presence,</b> and possession of false travel documents, but victims continue to be detained and deported, as they would be if they were arrested for immigration. Malaysian law does not provide immunity for criminal acts committed as a result of being trafficked. In January 2010, a 14-year-old Indonesian girl working as a worker in Malaysia was identified by authorities as a trafficking victim. Authorities prosecuted the girl for theft from her employer, and did not prosecute the girl’s employer for violating labourlaws. The government issued guidelines and provided training on the identification and processing of suspected trafficking victims, but did not develop or implement formal procedures to proactively identify victims of labour trafficking. The government treated victims of trafficking as illegal aliens and turned them over to immigration authorities for deportation after they provided evidence to prosecutors. Victims are required by law to assist in the prosecution of trafficking offenders, but the lack of victim protection or any incentives for victim assistance in investigations and prosecutions remained a significant impediment to successful prosecutions.|$|E

40|$|In the mid 1990 ’s, Congress {{passed a}} series of punitive {{immigration}} laws designed to ramp up enforcement and deter illegal immigration. Among these measures are provisions know as <b>unlawful</b> <b>presence</b> bars, which prohibit immigrant visa applicants who have been unlawfully present in the United States for certain periods of time from obtaining an immigrant visa for up to ten years or more. These bars frequently result in the protracted separation of undocumented applicants from their U. S. citizen or lawful permanent resident family members. After {{more than ten years}} since the passage of the <b>unlawful</b> <b>presence</b> bars, it is now appropriate to look closely at their impact and examine whether they constitute sound public policy. This Comment argues that they do not. Furthermore, it explains how the system puts families through unnecessary and unjustifiable hardship by imposing a punishment that is disproportionate to the seriousness of the immigration violation. This Comment points to the lack of evidence that the <b>unlawful</b> <b>presence</b> bars significantly deter illegal immigration, {{and the fact that they}} tear families apart or force them to move abroad. For these reasons, this Comment recommends that Congress make sensible changes that will promote family unity while imposing penalties that are more proportionate to the seriousness of being unlawfully present in the United States. Specifically, Congress should eliminate the <b>unlawful</b> <b>presence</b> bars while still requiring undocumented applicants for immigrant visas to process at a consulate in their home country. This would reduce the periods of family separation while maintaining a penalty for entering the country without permission. Concomitantly, Congress should pass a new law that would allow applicants who were minors when they entered the United States, and thus had no choice in the matter, to apply for lawful permanent residence without leaving the United States...|$|E
40|$|In a lucid and trenchant style {{characteristic}} of Professor Hiroshi Motomura’s writing, Immigration Outside the Law offers rich descriptive and prescriptive analyses of three major themes underlying debates about unauthorized migration: {{the meaning of}} <b>unlawful</b> <b>presence,</b> state and local involvement in the regulation of unauthorized migration, and the integration of unauthorized migrants into American society. This review advances several ideas that I argue are important to understanding these key themes. In brief, I suggest that a more comprehensive understanding of public debates about unauthorized migration requires examining lay moral judgments about <b>unlawful</b> <b>presence,</b> the expressive functions of immigration law, {{and the nature of}} contemporary forms of racial and ethnic bias against Latinos. I discuss how considering these ideas in connection with the book’s key themes and arguments might extend, strengthen, and complicate the book’s analysis and insights...|$|E
40|$|Changes in {{immigration}} laws that punish immigrants 2 ̆ 7 <b>unlawful</b> <b>presence</b> {{can have a}} substantial impact on marriage rates. This study examines the marriage propensity of residents in different sizes of immigrant-population counties before and after immigration law changes in 1994 and 1996. Legal Immigration and Family Equity Act 245 (i) (LIFE) enacted in 1994 provided opportunities for undocumented immigrants to change their immigrant status without leaving the United States. Marriage to a U. S. citizen or legal permanent resident was one way an undocumented immigrant would become eligible for the benefits from LIFE. Before this law change, consular processing abroad was the only option for undocumented immigrants who were ineligible for adjustment of status in the United States. The Illegal Immigration and Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) enacted in 1996 imposed bars to entry on undocumented immigrants who accumulated more than 180 days of <b>unlawful</b> <b>presence</b> in the U. S. after April 1, 1997. The bars to entry applied only if the undocumented immigrants left the U. S. and tried to re-enter. IIRIRA bars to entry were critical to the immigrant visa process because, if undocumented immigrants were subject to bars of admission, they were automatically ineligible for consular processing outside the United States. Examining marriage behavior {{before and after the}} enactment of IIRIRA indicates that for some undocumented immigrants, the introduction of punishment for <b>unlawful</b> <b>presence</b> affected their marital decisions...|$|E
40|$|In current {{debates about}} undocumented or illegal immigration, three themes {{have emerged as}} central: the meaning of <b>unlawful</b> <b>presence,</b> the role of states and cities, and the {{integration}} of immigrants. This Essay’s starting premise is that a reappraisal of these themes is essential to a conceptual roadmap of this difficult area of law and policy. This Essay argues {{that it is too}} narrow and too shallow to examine any of the three themes in isolation, as is typically done. Rather, each theme pairs up with another to reveal and elucidate a more fundamental question. The meaning of <b>unlawful</b> <b>presence</b> is connected to the role of states and cities; together they illuminate enforcement authority in immigration law. The role of states and cities combines with the integration of immigrants to show how communities that include immigrants are built. The meaning of <b>unlawful</b> <b>presence</b> and the integration of immigrants jointly shed light on how we think about the dimension of time in immigration law, and especially how we balance lessons from the past, present, and future. The conceptual roadmap generated by this new look at immigration outside the law is important for two reasons. First, it explains why disagreements often run deep, and it reorients debate around more productive questions. Second, it shows why finding common ground will require looking at broader questions of international and domestic economic development as well as domestic educational policy...|$|E
40|$|Though {{state laws}} that {{directly}} criminalize <b>unlawful</b> <b>presence</b> {{have been struck}} down {{in the wake of}} the Supreme Court’s decision in Arizona v. United States, the criminalization of immigrants continues unabated. This Article examines one form of criminalization, criminalization by “proxy,” by which state and local governments are punishing conduct by undocumented immigrants linked closely to their social and economic survival. More ubiquitous than previously understood, such measures have eluded constitutional scrutiny, confounding the legally constructed line between “civil” and “criminal” and the legally constructed distinction between “immigration crimes” and “other crimes. ” But, as this Article observes, they are no less pernicious than direct criminalization as a vessel for antipathy towards immigrants and their impact on communities no less profound. Using state driver’s license schemes as a paradigmatic example of subfederal proxy criminalization of migration, the Article argues that states should not be permitted to use their police powers to punish undocumented status simply because the laws they use are focused as a formal matter on conduct rather than status and tend to be rules of general applicability. The Article looks to the experience of another group that has long been subject to proxy criminalization at the local level — poor people who fall into homelessness — and courts’ analysis of local ordinances to limit their use of public space under the Eighth Amendment’s cruel and unusual punishment clause, to reveal transsubstantive lessons. It concludes by discussing the implications of a more nuanced conception of states’ role in the management of migration...|$|E
