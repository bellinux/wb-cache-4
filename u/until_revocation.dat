5|$|England under Henry IV {{was also}} looking {{to develop a}} silk industry, but no {{opportunity}} arose <b>until</b> the <b>revocation</b> of the Edict of Nantes the 1680s, when {{hundreds of thousands of}} French Huguenots, many of whom were skilled weavers and experts in sericulture, began immigrating to England to escape religious persecution. Some areas, including Spitalfields saw many high-quality silk workshops spring up, their products distinct from continental silk largely by the colors used. Nonetheless, the British climate prevented England's domestic silk trade from becoming globally dominant.|$|R
50|$|<b>Until</b> the <b>revocation</b> of the Edict of Nantes (1685), the {{secretary}} - whose oversight covered a huge geographical area - was especially concerned with communicating with provincial governors, intendants and bishops regarding {{real or imagined}} violations of {{the provisions of the}} Edict, and disputes concerning the demolition of temples and religious freedom. As public opinion in the 17th century became increasingly hostile to the Huguenots, the secretaries fulfilled their duties in applying more rigorous measures on the Protestants. In 1685, the then-secretary, Balthazar Phélypeaux, countersigned the Edict of Fontainebleau.|$|R
50|$|In France, {{from the}} 1550s, many {{attempts}} to reconcile Catholics and Protestants {{and to establish}} tolerance failed because the State {{was too weak to}} enforce them. It took the victory of prince Henry IV of France, who had converted into Protestantism, and his accession to the throne, to impose religious tolerance formalized in the Edict of Nantes in 1598. It would remain in force for over 80 years <b>until</b> its <b>revocation</b> in 1685 by Louis XIV of France. Intolerance remained the norm until Louis XVI, who signed the Edict of Versailles (1787), then the constitutional text of 24 December 1789, granting civilian rights to Protestants. The French Revolution then abolished state religion and confiscated all Church property, turning intolerance against Catholics.|$|R
5000|$|The {{medal and}} ribbon were {{designed}} first by Langford Jones, {{though it was}} changed throughout its existence. The phrase [...] "For God and the Empire" [...] was inscribed round the upper side of the obverse. The first type of reverse had six lions, with the Royal Cypher centred.

A silver laurel branch was added diagonally to the ribbon for both types of award in 1933. The ribbon changed to rose ink with pearl grey edges in July 1937, with an addition pearl grey vertical stripe for military awards, and stayed in this version <b>until</b> its <b>revocation.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 2009, Emmer {{sponsored}} {{a bill that}} would shorten the period of license revocation for driving under the influence and for refusing to take a sobriety test. Additionally, though [...] "suspected drunken drivers currently face revocation before they go to court," [...] Emmer's bill would have delayed <b>revocations</b> <b>until</b> after conviction. Supporters of Emmer's bill said [...] "it's needed because pre-conviction revocations penalize drivers before proving they're guilty."

5000|$|General Parole Revocation Procedures. This measure {{changed the}} board's parole {{revocation}} procedures for offenders {{after they have}} been paroled from prison. Under a federal court order in a case known as Valdivia v. Schwarzenegger, parolees were previously entitled to a hearing within 10 business days after being charged with violation of their parole to determine if there was probable cause to detain them <b>until</b> their <b>revocation</b> charges were resolved. The measure extended the deadline for this hearing to 15 days. The prior order also required that parolees arrested for parole violations have a hearing to resolve the revocation charges within 35 days. This measure extended this timeline to 45 days. It also provides for the appointment of legal counsel to parolees facing revocation charges only if the board determines, on a case-by-case basis, that the parolee is indigent because of the complexity of the matter or because of the parolee's mental or educational incapacity, the parolee appears incapable of speaking effectively in his or her defense. Because this measure does not provide for counsel at all parole revocation hearings, and because the measure does not provide counsel for parolees who are not indigent, a federal judge held it was in conflict with the Valdivia court order, which requires that all parolees be provided legal counsel. However, in March 2010, the Federal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the lower court ruling and directed it to reconcile its ruling with Proposition 9.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} gendering of heresy and general ignorance {{in relation to}} the making of a centralized state in Catholic Reformation France. It studies the strategies of reformers and propagandists in France during the seventeenth century, whose main ambition was to extirpate heresy, namely, the religion of the French Reformed Church. In so doing, they targeted female Protestants in their efforts to establish a French state unified under the single religion of Catholicism. Established in Paris in 1632, the Propagation de la foi (Propagation of Faith) began to spread out to other regions of France in the mid-seventeenth century. <b>Until</b> the <b>revocation</b> of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, the deliberation records of the meetings of the provincial compagnies reveal an intense focus to convert Huguenot girls and women. Taking into account the significance of the early modern family in the making of a moral society, the Propagation’s plan to find new homes, often in the way of marriage, resonated with their ultimate objective and that of the French Catholic Reformation. Financial incentives drew in new female converts {{and at the same time}} allowed individual women and the families of girls to take advantage of the Propagation. In addition, religious reformers who denigrated the early modern female body created a binary comparison such that pious women could take part in French Catholicism’s war against Protestantism. Female missionaries, patrons, and maternal models defined, in opposition to idolaters and heretics, idealized aspects of femininity. Through a good upbringing or “education,” France was poised to become the kind of state that zealous Catholics envisioned. Early modern writers such as Fénelon could not emphasize enough a proper education for girls, whose primary teachers were their mothers. Parents and especially mothers, therefore, had the civic responsibility to raise their daughters well: to be modest and chaste. By reforming the family, reformers sought to make good Catholic daughters who would curtail the development of future generations of unruly Huguenot girls and women...|$|R
