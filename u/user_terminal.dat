40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we present {{measurements}} that involve two access points (APs) and two <b>user</b> <b>terminals,</b> {{each of which}} is equipped with 4 antennas, in an indoor office environment. The data allow for the simultaneous characterization of the multiple input-multiple output (MIMO) links from the APs to the <b>user</b> <b>terminals</b> and between the <b>user</b> <b>terminals,</b> and are, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, the first of their kind. We show that the links between <b>user</b> <b>terminals</b> are impaired by body shadowing, and have therefore much lower gains than the direct links to the APs. Moreover we investigate the statistics of the links, and their correlation. Based on these measurements, we investigate the performance of cooperative relaying in terms of rate improvement (for this analysis the data from only one AP are used). We show that a significant rate improvement can be achieved if the relaying node is free to set the power level at which it transmits, and if it is free to select which of its antennas is used to perform the relaying.

30|$|As {{mentioned}} in Section 4.2, we use multiple sink nodes and multiple potential fields to acquire redundancy {{in case a}} sink node fails. We assume that all sink nodes {{are connected to the}} <b>user’s</b> <b>terminal</b> via the wired link and can communicate with each other. When a sink node receives upstream data, it sends the data to the <b>user’s</b> <b>terminal,</b> and a system on the <b>user’s</b> <b>terminal</b> records the tuple {source node’s ID, source node’s Pid, generation time of the data} in its look-up table. When a user wants to send a query or a control message, the user commands the system to send downstream data and the system selects the sink node that is closest to the destination. The selected sink node then starts to send the downstream data.|$|R
