25|$|In {{two days}} after the {{execution}} of Robespierre, the whole commune of Paris, consisting of about sixty persons, were guillotined in less than one hour and a half, in the Place de la Revolution; and though I was standing above a hundred paces from the place of execution, the blood of the victims streamed <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|E
25|$|Then {{last night}} {{something}} happened which I can neither explain nor understand. In {{the middle of}} the palms of my hands a red mark appeared, {{about the size of a}} penny, accompanied by acute pain in {{the middle of the}} red marks. The pain was more pronounced in the middle of the left hand, so much so that I can still feel it. Also <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> I can feel some pain.|$|E
500|$|The French action {{drew the}} {{attention}} of not just the British, but also the Indian tribes of the area. [...] Despite good Franco-Indian relations, British traders had become highly successful in convincing the Indians to trade with them in preference to the Canadiens, and the planned large-scale advance was not well received by all. [...] In particular, Tanacharison, a Mingo chief {{also known as the}} [...] "Half King", became decidedly anti-French as a consequence. [...] In a meeting with Paul Marin de la Malgue, commander of the French and Canadien construction force, the latter reportedly lost his temper, and shouted at the Indian chief, [...] "I tell you, down the river I will go. [...] If the river is blocked up, I have the forces to burst it open and tread <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> all that oppose me. [...] I despise all the stupid things you have said." [...] He then threw down some wampum that Tanacharison had offered as a good will gesture. [...] Marin died not long after, and command of the operations was turned over to Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre.|$|E

60|$|I kept very quiet, and {{he brushed}} {{two or three}} times past my legs, eyeing me sleepily. Then he took to nosing a {{beechnut}} from <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>foot,</b> as if I were no more interesting than Alexander was to Diogenes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm awfully sorry, Lucinda," [...] he said, striving with {{uncertain}} {{success to}} keep a suspicious quiver of laughter out of his tone.

2500|$|The French action {{drew the}} {{attention}} of not just the British, but also the Indian tribes of the area. [...] Despite good Franco-Indian relations, British traders became successful in convincing the Indians to trade with them in preference to the Canadiens, and the planned large-scale advance was not well received by all. [...] The reason for this {{was that they had}} to provide them with the goods that the Anglo-American traders had previously supplied, and at similar prices. This proved to be singularly difficult. [...] With the exception of one or two Montreal merchant traders, the Canadians showed a great reluctance to venture into the Ohio country.

60|$|And dark grass <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> Seems to dabble in me Like {{grass in}} a brook.|$|E
60|$|I leaped {{right at}} him with all my might as the goad flew over me. He turned to run as I jumped, and I bore him to the ground, came down right upon him, and slipped upon his smashed body and fell. He seemed to wriggle <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>foot.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Most of the {{recordings}} on this CD were done as if live. ...I {{sat in front}} of microphones with my bouzouki or mandolin in my lap, my harmonica in its holder round my neck, and my drone volume pedal on the floor, <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>foot,</b> and played and sang all in one go. â€”Sleeve notes from Andy Irvine - Rain on the Roof.|$|R
60|$|I {{failed to}} {{recognize}} him, but before I could speak I trod upon something that was alive and that squirmed <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>foot.</b> I was swept on by those behind and could not look down and see, and yet I {{knew that it was}} a woman who had fallen and who was being trampled into the pavement by thousands of successive feet.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I've seen her, of course. I'm not {{the fellow}} {{to let the}} grass grow <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet.</b> I've only just come from her house." ...|$|E
60|$|I, for one, do {{not call}} the sod <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> my country. But language, religion, laws, government, blood,--identity in these makes men of one country.|$|E
60|$|ADAM. No: I {{am afraid}} of it. I {{feel as if}} the ground were giving way <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> when it speaks. Do you stay and listen to it.|$|E
60|$|I moved, and {{the gravel}} crunched <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>foot,</b> whereupon she turned, and, at sight of me {{advancing}} towards her, she started. The blood mounted to her face, to ebb again upon the instant, leaving it paler {{than it had}} been. She made as if to depart; then she appeared to check herself, and stood immovable and outwardly calm, awaiting my approach.|$|R
60|$|I saw Pilate hesitate. His gaze roved to me, {{as if he}} {{were about}} to signal to me to let loose; and I half-started forward, {{releasing}} the mangled <b>foot</b> <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>foot.</b> I was for leaping to complete that half-formed wish of Pilate and to sweep away in blood and cleanse the court of the wretched scum that howled in it.|$|R
6000|$|... "What possessed you to {{run like}} that <b>under</b> <b>my</b> horse's <b>feet,</b> <b>my</b> poor girl?" [...] he asked, as Ned rose {{and began to cry}} loudly. Ned looked up in his face and rapidly said: [...] "I am the person you expect from Beerholt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, yes; {{wherever}} the grass may grow about my place, it doesn't grow <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet.</b> You won't often find me {{in bed at}} six o'clock, I can tell you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well?" [...] Father had a stern {{way with}} servants. When I'm {{head of the}} family I'll tread them <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet.</b> That's the way to get real devotion from servants! ...|$|E

60|$|I cannot get a boot on--wear a slipper on <b>my</b> left <b>foot,</b> and {{consequently}} am here <b>under</b> difficulties. <b>My</b> <b>foot</b> is occasionally painful, but not very. I don't think it worth while consulting anybody {{about it as}} yet. I make out so many reasons against supposing it to be gouty, that I really {{do not think it}} is.|$|R
6000|$|... "Master Shelton," [...] replied Lawless, [...] "I {{have been}} a Grey Friar--I praise fortune--an archer, a thief, and a shipman. Of all these coats, I had the best fancy {{to die in the}} Grey Friars, as ye may readily conceive, and the least fancy to die in John Shipman's tarry jacket; and that for two {{excellent}} good reasons: first, that the death might take a man suddenly; and second, for the horror of that great salt smother and welter <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>foot</b> here"--and Lawless stamped with his foot. [...] "Howbeit," [...] he went on, [...] "an I die not a sailor's death, and that this night, I shall owe a tall candle to our Lady." ...|$|R
60|$|The cries had ceased; {{the woods}} were all dark and silent when I came back. I went as swiftly as possible--without heed or caution; for {{whatever}} crackling I made the bear would attribute to the desperate mother--to {{the spot where}} I had turned back. Thence I went on cautiously, taking my bearings from one great tree on the ridge that lifted its bulk against the sky; slower and slower, till, just this side a great windfall, a twig cracked sharply <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>foot.</b> It was answered instantly by a grunt and a jump beyond the windfall--and then the crashing rush of a bear up the hill, carrying something that caught and swished loudly on the bushes as it passed, till the sounds vanished in a faint rustle far away, and the woods were still again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{see what}} Mas'r St. Clare wants of 'nother nigger!" [...] said Dinah, {{surveying}} the new arrival with no friendly air. [...] "Won't have her around <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet,</b> I know!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ow [...] . don't," [...] shrieked poor Anne. [...] "There {{are some}} long {{splinters}} sticking into me. See {{if you can}} put something <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> [...] . then perhaps I can draw myself up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 267 surged quickly <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet,</b> as the {{pressure}} of the downward-bearing bobstay was removed. Half-a-dozen men of the foc'sle had already thrown out fenders, and stood by to bear off a just visible bulwark.|$|E
60|$|It seemed {{colder than}} ever, and the mud when I got fairly into {{it was worse}} than I thought it could ha' been. It stuck to me like glue, and every step I took seemed colder than the one before. 'Owever, when I make up my mind to do a thing, I do it. I fixed my eyes on the place where I thought the purse was, and every time I felt {{anything}} <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>foot</b> I reached down and picked it up--and then chucked it away as far as I could so as not to pick it up agin. Dirty job it was, too, and in five minutes I was mud up to the neck, a'most. And I 'ad just got to wot I thought was the right place, and feeling about very careful, when the bell rang agin.|$|R
60|$|I {{had never}} made friends with a porcupine,--he is too briery a fellow for intimacies,--but now with a small stick I began to search him gently, {{wondering}} if, under all that armor of spears and brambles, I might not find {{a place where it}} would please him to be scratched. At the first touch he rolled himself together, all his spears sticking straight out on every side, like a huge chestnut bur. One could not touch him anywhere without being pierced by a dozen barbs. Gradually, however, as the stick touched him gently and searched out the itching spots under his armor, he unrolled himself and put his nose <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>foot</b> again. He did not want the beechnut; but he did want to nose it out. Unk Wunk is like a pig. He has very few things to do besides eating; but when he does start to go anywhere or do anything he always does it. Then I bent down to touch him with my hand.|$|R
60|$|Fallible and frail, {{a bit of}} pulsating, jelly-like life--it is all I am. About me are {{the great}} natural forces--colossal menaces, Titans of destruction, unsentimental monsters that have less concern for me than I have for the grain of sand I crush <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>foot.</b> They have no concern at all for me. They do not know me. They are unconscious, unmerciful, and unmoral. They are the {{cyclones}} and tornadoes, lightning flashes and cloud-bursts, tide-rips and tidal waves, undertows and waterspouts, great whirls and sucks and eddies, earthquakes and volcanoes, surfs that thunder on rock-ribbed coasts and seas that leap aboard the largest crafts that float, crushing humans to pulp or licking them off into the sea and to death--and these insensate monsters {{do not know that}} tiny sensitive creature, all nerves and weaknesses, whom men call Jack London, and who himself thinks he is all right and quite a superior being.|$|R
6000|$|One day, the Sunball having {{sent her}} to the straw shed to fetch straw, the girl {{sat down on the}} piles of straw and bemoaned herself, saving: 'As sighs this straw <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> so sighs my heart after my mother.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can I move {{safely in}} the matter, {{with such a}} pitfall as I see here open <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet?</b> How can I tell? Where can I find an {{experienced}} person to inform me? I must shut up my diary and think." ...|$|E
60|$|These {{last words}} he spoke down at me, smiling from high above; the next, he was <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet.</b> I {{continued}} {{to follow his}} evolutions with a childish fixity: they made me giddy and vacant, and I spoke as in a dream.|$|E
6000|$|And therewith {{they carried}} me {{on board the}} vessel, the [...] "St. Margaret," [...] of Berwick, laden with a cargo of dried salmon from Eden-mouth. They meant me no kindness, for {{there was an old}} feud between the {{scholars}} and the sailors; but it seemed to me, in my foolishness, that now I was in luck's way. I need not go back, with blood on my hands, to Pitcullo and my father. I had money in my pouch, my mother's gold chain about my neck, a ship's deck <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>foot,</b> and the seas before me. It was not hard for me to bargain with the shipmaster for a passage to Berwick, whence I might put myself aboard a vessel that traded to Bordeaux for wine from that country. The sailors I made my friends at no great cost, for indeed they were the conquerors, and could afford to show clemency, and hold me to slight ransom as a prisoner of war.|$|R
60|$|I {{took his}} pocket-book and the revolver, being {{resolved}} rather to die {{than to be}} captured, and laden besides with the basket and the bag of gems, set forward towards the north. The swamp, at that hour of the night, {{was filled with a}} continuous din: animals and insects of all kinds, and all inimical to life, contributing their parts. Yet {{in the midst of this}} turmoil of sound, I walked as though my eyes were bandaged, beholding nothing. The soil sank <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>foot,</b> with a horrid, slippery consistence, as though I were walking among toads; the touch of the thick wall of foliage, by which alone I guided myself, affrighted me like the touch of serpents; the darkness checked my breathing like a gag; indeed, I have never suffered such extremes of fear as during that nocturnal walk, nor have I ever known a more sensible relief than when I found the path beginning to mount and to grow firmer under foot, and saw, although still some way in front of me, the silver brightness of the moon.|$|R
60|$|Never yet had my life been so enjoyable {{to me as}} it was now. I was {{conscious}} of a delicious lightness of heart. The simplest things pleased me; I {{was ready to be}} kind to everybody, and to admire everything. Even the familiar scenery of my rides in the park developed beauties which I had never noticed before. The enchantments of music affected me to tears. I was absolutely in love with my dogs and my birds--and, as for my maid, I bewildered the girl with presents, and gave her holidays almost before she could ask for them. In a bodily sense, I felt an extraordinary accession of strength and activity. I romped with the dear old General, and actually kissed Lady Claudia, one morning, instead of letting her kiss me as usual. My friends noticed my new outburst of gayety and spirit--and wondered what had produced it. I can honestly say that I wondered too! Only on that wakeful night which followed our visit to Michael's room did I arrive at something like a clear understanding of myself. The next morning completed the process of enlightenment. I went out riding as usual. The instant when Michael put his hand <b>under</b> <b>my</b> <b>foot</b> as I sprang into the saddle, his touch flew all over me like a flame. I knew who had made a new woman of me from that moment.|$|R
