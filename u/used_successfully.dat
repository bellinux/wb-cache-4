5|$|In Great Britain, the Percheron is {{used for}} {{advertising}} and publicity, as well as forestry and farm work. They are crossbred with lighter horses by breeders of heavy hunters {{in order to increase}} size and improve disposition. Purebred Percherons are also ridden, and some have proven useful at show jumping. Crossbred Percherons have been <b>used</b> <b>successfully</b> in dressage. In both the Falkland Islands and northern Australia, Percherons have been crossed with local mares, primarily Criollos in the Falklands, to produce larger stock horses with greater stamina. These crossbred horses are used extensively in both the sub-Antarctic climate of the Falklands and the sub-tropical climate of Australia for working stock. In Australia they are also crossed with Thoroughbreds for use as mounted police horses.|$|E
5|$|Antiandrogens such as {{cyproterone}} acetate and spironolactone {{have been}} <b>used</b> <b>successfully</b> to treat acne, especially {{in women with}} signs of excessive androgen production such as increased hairiness or skin production of sebum, or baldness. Spironolactone is an effective treatment for acne in adult women, but unlike combination oral contraceptives, is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for this purpose. The drug is primarily used as an aldosterone antagonist and {{is thought to be}} a useful acne treatment due to its ability to block the androgen receptor at higher doses. It may be used with or without an oral contraceptive. Hormonal therapies should not be used to treat acne during pregnancy or lactation as they have been associated with birth disorders such as hypospadias, and feminization of the male fetus or infant. Finasteride is likely an effective treatment for acne.|$|E
5|$|Banksia verticillata {{has been}} {{declared}} vulnerable under the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, and Rare under Western Australia's Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. A 1995 census yielded an estimated total population size of 4500 plants. Apart from dieback and aerial canker, frequency of bushfires and illegal picking have been cited as threats. Ongoing management includes monitoring of current populations, gathering more data on best response to fire, and restricting access to populations. Seed has been collected from many populations, but germination rates after ten years of storage are much lower than in Banksia brownii. Translocation is considered an option in the future, as is spraying with phosphite, particularly {{in the vicinity of}} Walpole. <b>Used</b> <b>successfully</b> on B.brownii but as yet untrialled with B.verticillata, phosphite boosts the resistance of both infected and uninfected plants, and also acts as a direct fungicide. Aerial spraying of phosphite boosts plant survival and slows the spread of infection, but must be carefully managed as studies have shown that foliar spraying of phosphite adversely affects root and shoot growth.|$|E

5|$|From {{a handful}} of company designs, Saville {{selected}} Hughes Aircraft to make the FCS. Saville worked closely with Dr. Ruben F. Mettler of Hughes, {{to lay out the}} desired strategy of the weapons system and to describe the expected fighter tactics. This weapon would eventually be developed as the AIM-4 Falcon after much urging by Saville. The Falcon was <b>used</b> <b>successfully</b> for more than a decade, beginning in 1956. Designing an aircraft around a weapons system was something Saville had witnessed in the development of Bell's P-39 Airacobra around a large autocannon, but he further refined the concept and made it a requirement for government contractors, a practice that is continued to this day. Saville put an end to specific design goals in aircraft requests for proposal (RFPs); instead, he briefed potential designers on general requirements and discussed with them the defense problems the aircraft was to solve.|$|E
5|$|The {{high-pressure}} oxygen {{atmosphere was}} consistent with that that had been <b>used</b> <b>successfully</b> in the Mercury and Gemini programs. The pressure before launch was deliberately greater than ambient in order to drive out the nitrogen-containing air {{and replace it with}} pure oxygen, and also to seal the plug door hatch cover. During launch, the pressure would have been gradually reduced to the in-flight level of , providing sufficient oxygen for the astronauts to breathe while reducing the fire risk. The Apollo 1 crew had successfully tested this procedure with their spacecraft in the Operations and Checkout Building altitude (vacuum) chamber on October 18 and 19, 1966, and the backup crew of Schirra, Eisele and Cunningham had repeated it on December 30. The investigation board noted that, during these tests, the Command Module had been fully pressurized with pure oxygen four times, for a total of six hours and fifteen minutes, {{two and a half hours}} longer than it had been during the plugs-out test.|$|E
5|$|With the {{inclined}} plane, {{the problems}} {{stemmed from a}} mis-calculation. Power was provided by a large tank, filled with water, which descended in a shaft, raising one boat on a trolley and allowing another to descend as it did so. When the tank reached {{the bottom of the}} shaft, the water discharged, and the second tank was used to reverse the process. Green had been the engineer on the Bude Canal, where this design had been <b>used</b> <b>successfully,</b> but the size of the tanks at Wellisford were much too small. On the Bude Canal, a tank holding 15tons of water was required to raise a boat weighing six tons. The Grand Western Canal used boats holding eight tons, but the tanks only held ten tons of water, whereas tests indicated that about 25tons was needed. It was for this reason that the steam engine was obtained to supply the power.|$|E

5|$|Franklin Pierce won {{the presidential}} election, and in 1853 made Davis his Secretary of War. In this capacity, Davis began the Pacific Railroad Surveys {{in order to}} {{determine}} various possible routes for the proposed Transcontinental Railroad. He promoted the Gadsden Purchase of today's southern Arizona from Mexico, partly because it would provide an easier southern route for the new railroad; the Pierce administration agreed, and the land was purchased in December 1853. He saw the size of the regular army as insufficient to fulfill its mission, and maintained that salaries would have to be increased, something which had not occurred for 25 years. Congress agreed and increased the pay scale, and added four regiments which increased the army's size from about 11,000 to about 15,000. Davis also introduced general usage of the rifles that he had <b>used</b> <b>successfully</b> during the Mexican–American War. As a result, both the morale and capability of the army was improved. He became involved in public works when Pierce gave him responsibility for construction of the Washington Aqueduct and an expansion of the U.S. Capitol, both of which he managed closely. The Pierce administration ended in 1857 after Pierce's loss of the Democratic nomination to James Buchanan. Davis's term was to end with Pierce's, so he ran for the Senate, was elected, and re-entered it on March 4, 1857.|$|E
