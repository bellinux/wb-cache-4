All participants completed a drug history questionnaire (DHQ), the impulsiveness venturesomeness and empathy questionnaire, a novel risk-taking task (Bets 16), and 59 also completed the tri-dimensional personality questionnaire (TPQ). DHQ responses allocated participants to five groups: non-drug controls, cannabis <b>users,</b> polydrug (no ecstasy) <b>users,</b> low (20 occasions) ecstasy <b>users.</b> Eighteen {{percent of the}} sample had used ecstasy and of the ecstasy <b>users,</b> only one had not used other substances.

40|$|Introduction: Studies {{investigating}} risk-related {{behavior in}} relation to new psychoactive substance (NPS) use are sparse. The current study investigated characteristics of NPS <b>users</b> by comparing risk-related behavior of NPS <b>users</b> to that of illicit drugs (ID) <b>users</b> and licit substances <b>users</b> and non-users (NLC) <b>users.</b> Methods: In this cross-sectional study we included 528 individuals across an age range of 18 - 72 years. Using a web-based questionnaire we collected self-report data on substance use, sensation seeking, impulsivity, peer substance use and risk perception of substance use. Results: NPS and ID <b>users</b> had {{a higher level of}} sensation seeking compared to NLC <b>users</b> (NPS users: p < 0. 001; ID users: p < 0. 001). NPS <b>users</b> (p < 0. 001), but not ID <b>users</b> (p = 0. 16), had increased levels of impulsivity compared to NLC <b>users.</b> NPS <b>users</b> had significantly higher scores for sensation seeking (F- 1,F- 423 = 51. 52, p < 0. 001) and impulsivity (F- 1,F- 423 = 6. 15, p = 0. 01) compared to ID <b>users.</b> Additionally, NPS <b>users</b> had significantly more peers who use substances compared to ID and NLC <b>users.</b> Also, NPS and ID <b>users</b> had lower risk perception for most substances than NLC <b>users.</b> NPS <b>users</b> had lower risk perception for most substances than ID <b>users.</b> Conclusions: The findings highlight that NPS <b>users</b> show substantial more risk-related behavior than both ID and NLC <b>users.</b> Therefore, NPS <b>users</b> might be considered as a distinctive group of substance <b>users</b> that need another approach in terms of prevention.

40|$|Previous {{research}} suggests {{elevated levels of}} impulsivity and psychopathology in recreational ecstasy <b>users.</b> However, most recreational ecstasy <b>users</b> tend to be poly-drug <b>users.</b> The present study aimed to investigate impulsivity and psychopathology {{in a sample of}} recreational ecstasy polydrug <b>users</b> compared with samples of non-ecstasy <b>users,</b> while statistically controlling for estimated life-time drug usage. Sixty-eight non-drug controls, 79 non-ecstasy poly-drug <b>users,</b> 11 ‘light’ ecstasy poly-drug <b>users,</b> and 47 ‘heavy’ ecstasy poly drug <b>users</b> completed the Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS- 11) and the SCL- 90 R and a drug history questionnaire.
