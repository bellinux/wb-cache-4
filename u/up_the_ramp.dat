5|$|In {{the fifth}} match, Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff faced Smackdown General Manager Theodore Long (with Palmer Canon). Two referees from each show officiated the match. Theodore Long, began by {{avoiding}} Eric's attacks. As Canon climbed on the apron, and distracted the referees, Bischoff used his obi to choke Long. Bischoff continued choking Long and applied the sleeper hold. Cannon distracted the referees again as Long hit Bischoff with his shoe. The Boogeyman's music played with Bischoff sending the referees <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>ramp</b> to stop him. The Boogeyman delivered a pumphandle slam to Bischoff and Long pinned Bischoff {{to win the}} match.|$|E
5|$|The {{other main}} match {{on the card}} was a Hardcore match for the WWE Intercontinental Championship between Randy Orton and Cactus Jack. Three months prior at the Royal Rumble, after Mick Foley {{eliminated}} Orton from the Royal Rumble match, Orton hit Foley with a steel chair, and the two brawled <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>ramp</b> and into the back. In March at WrestleMania XX, Evolution (Orton, Batista, and Ric Flair) faced off against The Rock 'n' Sock Connection (Foley and The Rock) in a Handicap match. Evolution won the match when Orton pinned Foley after an RKO. Two weeks later, Foley challenged Orton to a Hardcore match for the WWE Intercontinental Championship at Backlash, which Orton accepted that same night.|$|E

They continue singing the song together, standing side by side and holding hands. After completing the song, both singers exit the auditorium together as in the first video, simulating two friends enjoying time with each other. Both videos are very similar, only the alternate version does not feature an audience, choir or images, only the duo singing together atop the stone altar. In this version of the video, Houston wears a long brown strapless gown, and features a shoulder length bob haircut. Carey on the otherhand, features long cascading curls and dons an olive green gown.|$|E

5|$|In February 2014, strange vignettes began airing {{advertising}} Hardy's {{return to}} TNA under his OMEGA character, Willow. He made his TNA return at Lockdown, in the Lethal Lockdown match {{as part of}} Team MVP. He then appeared on the following episode of Impact Wrestling, facing Rockstar Spud. In the following weeks, {{he would continue to}} feud with Ethan Carter III and Rockstar Spud, leading to a tag-team match between them (with Kurt Angle as Willow's partner) at Sacrifice on April 27, Willow and Angle would go on to win that match. On the May 1 episode of Impact Wrestling, Willow defeated James Storm by disqualification when Storm shoved the referee and as Storm made his way <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>ramp,</b> Mr. Anderson appeared and hit Storm with the Mic check. On the May 8 episode of Impact Wrestling, Willow's match against Magnus ended in a DQ when Bram interfered and handcuffed Willow to the bottom rope and started to hit him with a metal turnbuckle. On the May 15 episode of Impact Wrestling, Willow defeated both Magnus and Bram in a two on one handicap match. On the May 22 episode of Impact Wrestling, Willow defeated Magnus in a Falls Count Anywhere match. On the June 5 episode of Impact Wrestling, Willow won his match against Bram by DQ when Magnus came to the ring and attacked him with a Steel Pry Bar. At Slammiversary XII, Willow was defeated by Magnus.|$|E
5|$|A.J. Styles fought Kurt Angle in a Last Man Standing match next. In a Last Man Standing match, {{there are}} no {{disqualifications}} or count outs, instead to win the match the competitor has to force their opponent to {{not be able to}} reach a standing position by the count of 10. However, this match was only promoted as a Last Man Standing match, instead it was held under Texas Death match rules where a wrestler must pin or submit their opponent and then have them fail to respond to a count of 10. Styles got the first fall of the night, when he forced Angle to tap out to Angle's own signature submission maneuver the Ankle lock. Angle made it to his feet before the count concluded. Angle gained a pinfall later on in the match after slamming Styles off the top of a padded turnbuckle with a suplex. Before Styles could reach his feet to beat the count, Angle slammed Styles onto the mat back-first with his signature Olympic slam maneuver and gained another pinfall to start the count over. Styles beat that count as well, with Angle trying for the Olympic Slam again before Styles' countered it into his signature Styles' Clash maneuver and pinned Angle. After Angle reached his feet, Styles and Angle fought up a padded turnbuckle with Styles gaining the advantage. At this time, Styles grabbed Angle by the neck and fell backwards from the turnbuckle and drove Angle head-first into the mat. Angle failed to reach the 10 count afterwards, with Styles being declared the winner of the contest at 24 minutes and 50 seconds. Following the encounter, the referee called for medical attention for Angle who was scripted to appear as if he had suffered a neck injury. Styles then entered the ring once Angle reached his feet and lifted Angle up and dropped him on his head. As Styles walked <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>ramp,</b> he was attacked by Sting, who drove Styles' head into the ramp with his signature Scorpion Death Drop maneuver, as Kevin Nash looked on.|$|E
5|$|The {{other main}} match {{on the card}} was a Hardcore Intergender match, as Edge and Mick Foley faced Terry Funk and Tommy Dreamer. The rivalry started between Edge and Foley, when the two faced in a Hardcore match at WrestleMania 22. Edge won the match after a spear off the apron and through a flaming table on the outside. Foley was a guest on the Cutting Edge on the May 1, 2006 episode of Raw, and the two agreed to a WrestleMania Hardcore rematch the {{following}} week. Before the match began on the May 8, 2006 edition of Raw, Foley announced that the match was now a triple threat match, with Tommy Dreamer added as the third person. During the match, however, Foley turned heel {{for the first time}} in over eight years and attacked Dreamer with a barbed wire baseball bat. Foley handed Edge the bat and Edge hit Dreamer with it, busting him open. Foley hit the Mandible claw on Dreamer and Edge simultaneously speared Dreamer, with Foley getting the pinfall. The two, along with Lita celebrated up the entrance ramp. On the May 15, 2006 episode of Raw, Foley wanted to apologize to Dreamer for what happened the previous week; however, Dreamer was not in the arena, so Foley brought out Terry Funk. Funk asked Foley to apologize for what happened to Dreamer. Instead, Foley started bashing ECW. In an attempt to get into a fight with Foley, Funk made comments about Foley's family, calling his wife a whore and his kids s. When the two exchanged punches, Edge and Lita came out, with Lita low-blowing Funk. Edge and Foley double-teamed Funk, with Edge hitting Funk with a barbed wire baseball bat. A week later, on the May 22, 2006 edition of Raw, Edge and Foley announced themselves as co-holders of the WWE Hardcore Championship. Paul Heyman came out and made a challenge to Edge and Foley to face Funk and Dreamer at One Night Stand, which Edge accepted. The two, along with Lita, went after Heyman <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>ramp,</b> before Dreamer and Funk attacked them with several weapons, sending the trio out of the arena. On the WWE vs. ECW Head to Head special that aired on June 7, 2006, Edge faced Dreamer in an Extreme Rules match. Dreamer hit Edge with a Dreamer Driver through the table. Lita interfered, and hit Dreamer repeatedly with a cane. Dreamer was not hurt by the shots, and he got Lita up for a powerbomb, before Edge speared Dreamer. Edge got the pinfall and won the match. During the match, Foley and Funk were fighting outside the ring, with Funk busting Foley open. After the match, Foley sat in the middle of the ring and stated his kayfabe thoughts on ECW.|$|E

50|$|The {{architraves}} on top {{of these}} columns are estimated to weigh 70 tons. These architraves may have been lifted to these heights using levers. This would be an extremely time-consuming process and also would require great balance to get to such great heights. A common alternative theory regarding how they were moved is that large ramps were constructed of sand, mud, brick or stone and that the stones were then towed <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>ramps.</b> If stone had been used for <b>the</b> <b>ramps,</b> {{they would have been}} able to use much less material.

25|$|For the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Cathy Freeman {{walked across}} a {{circular}} {{pool of water}} and ignited the cauldron through the water, surrounding herself within a ring of fire. The planned spectacular climax to the ceremony was delayed by the technical glitch of a computer switch which malfunctioned, causing the sequence to shut down by giving a false reading. This meant that the Olympic flame was suspended in mid-air for about four minutes, rather than immediately rising up a water-covered ramp {{to the top of}} the stadium. When it was discovered what the problem was, the program was overridden and the cauldron continued <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>ramp,</b> where it finally rested on a tall silver pedestal.|$|E

25|$|Undertaker {{would return}} on the March 6 episode of Raw after Braun Strowman called out Reigns. Strowman left the ring {{following}} a brief staredown with Undertaker, who was then confronted by Reigns. After disrespectful comments were made by Reigns, The Undertaker performed a chokeslam on him. This led to a No Holds Barred match between Undertaker and Reigns at WrestleMania 33 on April 2, where Undertaker lost to Reigns after five spears in his fourth WrestleMania main event. After the match, Undertaker left his gloves, coat and hat {{in the center of}} the ring before slowly making his exit, also walking over to his wife Michelle McCool to kiss her, then walked <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>ramp</b> and performed his signature arm-raised pose as smoke surrounded him and he descended down into the ramp to the sound of his music.

25|$|This {{brought a}} third {{approach}} to entering the city.

Its scope was not to cause a collapse of the wall — the buttress had been successful — but to pass under it and penetrate the city. This tunnel was built to allow the Persians four abreast to move through it. It eventually entered the city and pierced the inner embankment and, when the ramp was completed, Dura's end had come. As Persian troops charged <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>ramp,</b> their counterparts in the tunnel would have invaded the city with little opposition, as nearly all the defenders would have been on the wall attempting to repel the attack from the ramp.

25|$|The most {{successful}} freight service was the uncrushed ballast service. Following withdrawal of War Department operations over their siding near Maddieson's Camp, the railway utilised the infrastructure to operate ballast trains. In 1937 a subsidiary ballast company was formed. Tipper wagons (skips) were loaded with shingle and transported along the branch line {{and then up}} the main line to Hythe, often lying over in the sidings at Dymchurch to prevent delay to passenger trains using the same tracks. At Hythe the wagons were originally pushed by the locomotive up a concrete ramp and the wagons tipped into a large concrete holding bin or directly into waiting lorries, a precarious practice which was later replaced by mechanical haulage <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>ramp.</b> After the war the Hythe workings were cut back and the wagons were unloaded in a siding (in what is now New Romney station car park), the remnant of which is now used for loading coal into loco tenders. This practice didn't last long and a purpose built siding and ramp was installed south of New Romney on the Dungeness line. The fence line can still be seen. In 1951, after 14 years, the subsidiary company switched to entirely road transport and the company closed the branch and the freight incline. At Hythe, the concrete pillars were still visible until the early 1980s when they were demolished to allow access to the car park extension along the former platform 4 and engine release siding.|$|E

40|$|In the Cambrian–Ordovician {{sandstones}} of south-west Jordan, {{the spectacular}} scenery {{that has developed}} under arid conditions includes the presence of low-angle (< 10 °) ramp slopes lying beneath vertical cliffs and running down to adjacent wadi beds or playas. <b>The</b> <b>ramps</b> are depositional features built of fine debris with occasional larger clasts and may be mantled by weathered boulders in their upper parts. These ramps are especially well displayed in the Ishrin Sandstone, but {{seem to be the}} landforms rarely, if ever reported from desert environments. <b>The</b> analysis of <b>ramp</b> geomorphology and sedimentology, and of rock slopes above <b>the</b> <b>ramps,</b> strongly suggests that most of the material that makes <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>ramps</b> is provided by catastrophic rockfalls. Rockfall debris is subjected to efficient salt weathering and quickly disintegrates into easily transported fine-grained material which, redistributed by surface wash, builds <b>the</b> <b>ramps.</b> <b>The</b> uniqueness of <b>the</b> <b>ramps</b> arises from a combination of lithological and environmental factors, the former accounting for the high frequency of rockfalls in the Ishrin sandstone, the latter being responsible for the efficacy of salt weathering and surface wash...|$|R

One part of the match saw Cena backdrop JBL through the announce table. Shortly after, JBL hit Cena with a steel chair which caused Cena to bleed from his forehead. Back in the ring, JBL hit Cena with a Clothesline from Hell thrice. Cena later hit JBL with a Five Knuckle Shuffle and a FU. Later in the match, <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>ramp</b> area, Cena threw JBL face first through a television monitor. The match ended when JBL said [...] "I quit", as Cena prepared to hit him with an exhaust pipe, which came from the semi truck that was at the ramp area. As a result, Cena retained the WWE Championship. Despite the match being over, Cena then hit JBL with the exhaust pipe. Because of the amount of blood Cena lost, the pay-per-view was rated TV-MA on WWE Network On Demand.|$|E

2500|$|Circa 1940 {{images of}} the house show that Modernist {{elements}} were incorporated into Harrison's design. A photograph of the façade reveals a stone garage next to a simple white door, with a high serpentine wall snaking <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>ramp</b> path to the front door; the house's two-story façade is made of stone with porthole windows and a large rectangular stone structure {{to the right of}} the front door. It presents a very private and industrial front, with stone and glass, and a ramp path to the door, like a conveyor belt in a factory. The back view exemplifies use of the building's twelve exterior doors, many of them stone and glass, and opens up to a wider view of the back, which is more spacious with trees and in harmony with nature because of the local fieldstone that echoes the surrounding rocky landscape. There is little ornamental decoration, it is simply constructed with industrial materials in keeping with Breuer and Gropius's idea of [...] "unit construction" [...] or the bringing together of [...] "standard units to create a technologically simple but functionally complex whole," [...] and the use of new materials to create art design that reflected the age of industry. With Harrison's use of steel and glass, as well as the industrial conveyor-belt like ramp to the house's front door, Harrison used new materials to reflect the age of industry, and its simple forms of stone sections form a composite, complex stone entirety. Gropius and Breuer designed Gropius's own house in ppLincoln, Massachusetts]], which used both fieldstone and wood painted white, re-establishing [...] "New England traditionalism in modern terms." [...] With his use of fieldstone in the Street residence, Harrison was even incorporating some of the same materials as the Modernist architects of his time, Gropius and Breuer.|$|E
