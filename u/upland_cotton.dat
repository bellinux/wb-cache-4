40|$|Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum (FOV) Atk. Sny & Hans is a {{continuing}} threat to cotton production in the United States that warrants attention in plant breeding programs. Several developments concerning this pathogen (e. g. newly-recognized Australian FOV races and identification of FOV race 4 in California) highlight {{the need for additional}} research to provide improved host plant resistance to this pathogen. In order to assess the U. S. cotton gene pool and to study host plant resistance to FOV race 4, field and greenhouse evaluations were conducted in 2003, 2004, and 2005 on more than 150 Pima (Gossypium barbadense L.) and Acala and non-Acala Upland (G. hirsutum L.) entries. A population of 32 Pima recombinant inbred lines (RILs) and six F 1 combinations of hybrids developed between susceptible and resistant en-tries were also evaluated. Pima cottons inoculated with race 4 developed more severe symptoms than the Acala and non-Acala <b>Upland</b> <b>cottons,</b> but some Acala and <b>Upland</b> <b>cottons</b> were severely infected. Germplasm with high levels of resistant to FOV race 4 was identified in some Pima entries. Resistance against FOV race 4 in Pima cottons was more complete than expected and may be determined by a single dominant major gene and one or more modifying minor genes, which may explain the trangressive segregation observed in some RILs. FOV resistance in Acala and non-Acala <b>Upland</b> <b>cottons</b> may be more complex and may be inherited in a quantitative manner by several major genes and minor modifying genes.

40|$|The 1985 and 1986 Cotton Reports {{have the}} same {{publication}} and P-Series numbers. Verticillium wilt tolerance and varietal response were factors in lint yield in this test. Highest yields {{were obtained from the}} first planting on 8 April. The 19 April planting had a lower average yield than the 7 May planting, probably because of poorer stands. Lint yields decreased an average of 5 pounds of lint/acre/day between 8 April and 7 May; 9 pounds between 7 May and 24 May; and 15 pounds between 24 May and 10 June. Deltapine (DP) 90 had the highest lint yield for the first two plantings and was among the highest for all plantings. DP 30 was highest in lint yield for the third and fourth plantings and high at other planting dates. Wilt tolerance was a factor in DP 30 performance.

40|$|Abstract. Seed {{surface area}} is the basic ground for lint {{production}} in cotton and, hence, {{a starting point for}} genetic improvement in lint yield. Experiments on <b>upland</b> <b>cottons</b> were carried out under 2 temperature regimes (April sown, high temperature regime; June sown, moderate regime) for 2 years in the field to study their modifying effect on phenotypic expression and combining ability of lint weight per seed (LW/S), lint weight per unit seed surface area (LW/SA), lint weight per unit fibre length (LW/FL), lint frequency (LF), number of spinnable fibres per seed (F/S), and number of spinnable fibres per unit seed surface area (F/SA). Variation among cultivars for relative decrease in the basic lint traits under high temperature regime indicated their differences in heat sensitivity. Genetic variation for all basic lint traits was low over environments but high within environments. Temperature regime was a stronger source of variation in basic lint traits than year. Temperature regimes modified phenotype, ranking among parents, and combining ability of basic lint traits. Relative contribution of specific combining ability to total variation decreased under high temperature regime for all the basic lint traits, except LW/FL, with a corresponding increase in general combining ability due to either female or male parents.

2500|$|When Magomero was acquired, it was uncultivated {{and largely}} unoccupied. The first estate crop tried at Magomero was Arabica coffee in 1895, but after poor crops and a {{collapse}} in world coffee prices in 1903, this was abandoned. [...] When Alexander Livingstone Bruce {{came to live}} in Nyasaland, the main estate crop was cotton. In 1908, 1,000 acres of a hardy variety of <b>Upland</b> <b>cotton</b> called Nyasaland Upland was planted at Magomero; this was increased to 5,000 acres by 1914. Cotton required intensive labour throughout its five- or six-month growing season, {{and to ensure that}} sufficient workers were available, estate owners exploited the obligations of a labour tenancy system called thangata. This meant the work done by African tenants on European-owned estates in lieu of rent. Alexander Livingstone Bruce was said to have pioneered the thangata system, and once Magomero started to grow cotton, Bruce, who lived in Nyasaland and had control of the estate operations, instructed his manager to exploit thangata rigorously. When cotton growing started, the Bruce estates increased the labour demand to four or five months a year, mainly in the growing season, leaving tenants little time to grow their food.|$|E
2500|$|Livingstone {{turned to}} cotton from 1903: growing [...] Egyptian cotton was {{unsuccessful}} {{as it was}} more suitable for hotter areas, but from 1906, he developed a hardier variety of <b>Upland</b> <b>cotton</b> called Nyasaland Upland, and in 1908 planted 1,000 acres at Magomero with it; this was increased to 5,000 acres by 1914. Cotton required intensive labour over a long growing period, and Livingstone ensured that 3,000 to 5,000 workers were available throughout its five or six month growing season by exploiting the obligations of the labour tenancy system called thangata. This word originally meant help, such as one neighbour might give another, but it came to mean the work that a tenant on a European-owned estate had to undertake in lieu of rent. Tenants were also required to undertake additional work {{on account of the}} Hut tax which the owner paid on behalf of tenants. Other men worked for wages: they were often unpaid, underpaid or given tobacco instead of cash, and violently coerced by the owners. Although William Jervis Livingstone pioneered the thangata system at Magomero from 1906, once Alexander Livingstone Bruce came to live in Nyasaland in 1908 and control of the estate operations, he instructed Livingstone, his manager, to exploit thangata rigorously to maximise the amount of cotton grown. The A L Bruce Estates increased the labour demand to four or five months a year, mainly in the rainy season, which was also the main growing season for both cotton and food crops, leaving tenants little time to grow their food. Single women tenants and widows were now also required to work.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The Cotton Microsatellite Database (CMD) [URL] is a curated and {{integrated}} web-based relational database providing centralized access to publicly available cotton microsatellites, an invaluable resource for basic and applied research in cotton breeding. Description At present CMD contains publication, sequence, primer, mapping and homology data for nine major cotton microsatellite projects, collectively representing 5, 484 microsatellites. In addition, CMD displays data {{for three of}} the microsatellite projects that have been screened against a panel of core germplasm. The standardized panel consists of 12 diverse genotypes including genetic standards, mapping parents, BAC donors, subgenome representatives, unique breeding lines, exotic introgression sources, and contemporary <b>Upland</b> <b>cottons</b> with significant acreage. A suite of online microsatellite data mining tools are accessible at CMD. These include an SSR server which identifies microsatellites, primers, open reading frames, and GC-content of uploaded sequences; BLAST and FASTA servers providing sequence similarity searches against the existing cotton SSR sequences and primers, a CAP 3 server to assemble EST sequences into longer transcripts prior to mining for SSRs, and CMap, a viewer for comparing cotton SSR maps. Conclusion The collection of publicly available cotton SSR markers in a centralized, readily accessible and curated web-enabled database provides a more efficient utilization of microsatellite resources and will help accelerate basic and applied research in molecular breeding and genetic mapping in Gossypium spp. </p...|$|R
