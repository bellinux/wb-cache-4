40|$|Today’s {{building}} façades are not imaginable {{without the}} building material glass. Modern architects capitalise the transparency and the {{load carrying capacity}} of glass elements {{in the design of}} filigree and light-flooded structures. Priority is thereby given to the maximal transparency and the energy efficiency of the glass façade. In fact, the strategy paper “EU 2020 ” formulated by the European Union has an important impact on the design of glass façade and the energy efficiency will be a focal point in the design of glass façades in future. The optimal combination of transparency and energy efficiency is achieved by using point fitted insulation glass units. Their application in glass façades becomes therefore indispensable in the future. Currently, three different point fitting systems for point fitted insulation glass units exist. They however present several disadvantages concerning their installation procedure and the tightness of the glazing cavity. Additionally, a general design concept for point fitted insulation glass does currently not exist. In consequence, point fitted insulation glass is a non-regulated construction product and requires an approval in individual cases from the national building authorities. A model to proof the structural integrity of a developed point fitted insulation glass unit with a suitable point fitting system and edge seal system is proposed. A state of the art investigation reveals the Fischer <b>undercut</b> <b>anchor</b> to be the most suitable type for the application in insulation glass. A novel design concept for point fitted insulation glass with undercut anchors is developed. The concept considers the determination of the climate loads and proposes a verification procedure for each structural element of the insulation glass unit. For this purpose, an existing climate load model for linearly supported insulation glass is analytically extended to the static system of point fitted insulation glass units with undercut anchors. For the verification of the connection <b>undercut</b> <b>anchor</b> in glass, an existing design method for point fitted single and laminated glazing is extended to point fitted insulation glass. Component tests are conducted on the Fischer anchor and its ultimate load bearing capacity in glass is determined. A calibrated numerical model of the proposed point fitted insulation glass unit with the Fischer anchor is developed for parametric studies. Large scale tests on the proposed new point fitted insulation glass unit are run with the aim to verify the numerical model, the climate load model and the extended design method and to proof the structural integrity of the entire unit. Finally a new point fitted insulation glass unit with a suitable point fitting type and a corresponding novel design concept is developed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the application of}} three-dimensional (3 D) -constitutive models for concrete formulated {{in the framework of}} plasticity theory to structural analyses of anchor devices. For this purpose, two commonly employed concrete material models are considered. The first model, the extended Leon model, is based on one yield surface for the description of compressive and tensile failure of concrete. The second material model is a multisurface plasticity model consisting of three Rankine yield surfaces and a Drucker-Prager yield surface. The predictive capability of the models is demonstrated by means of anchor devices, commonly employed in structural engineering for the connection of steel and concrete members. Such devices induce strongly nonuniform triaxial stress states in the surrounding concrete, ranging from tensile, overcompressive, to confined compressive stress states. In the vicinity of the anchor head, even nearly hydrostatic stress states may occur. The numerical simulations {{on the basis of the}} employed 3 D material models for concrete give insight into the load-carrying behavior of the investigated anchor devices. Two headed studs characterized by different shapes of the anchor head and an <b>undercut</b> <b>anchor</b> are considered. Comparison of the peak loads and failure modes of the respective anchor device predicted by the numerical models with experimental data highlight the strength and weakness of the employed material models. It is shown that some load cases may lead to rather large differences in peak load depending on the choice of material model. These differences are based on the individual properties of the constitutive models for concrete and, hence, detailed knowledge of the model under consideration is essential for giving accurate estimates of the peak load of the anchor device and the failure mode of concrete...|$|E
30|$|Zhang et al. (2001) {{summarized}} {{the results of}} a comprehensive study of anchors in cracked and uncracked concrete led by Dr. Klingner at the University of Taxes, Austin in 1990 s. The tests focused on expansion <b>anchors</b> and <b>undercut</b> <b>anchors</b> that are of interest by nuclear industries. Groups of four anchors were subjected to cyclic moments at a rate similar to that in an earthquake. The tests indicated that the cracks up to 0.25  mm [0.01 in.] did not affect the capacity of tested <b>undercut</b> <b>anchors</b> but caused larger displacements at failure. Meanwhile, the expansion anchors in cracks developed low capacity and in some cases the failure modes changed from concrete breakout (for anchors in uncracked concrete) to pull-out (for anchors in cracked concrete).|$|R

40|$|Anchoring {{elements}} such as headed and expansion studs and grouted or <b>undercut</b> <b>anchors,</b> are often used for local transfer of loads into concrete members. In order {{to better understand the}} failure mechanism, a large number of experiments have been carried out in the past. However, due to the complicated three-dimensional load transfer a very few or no numerical studies have been performed for a number of different fastening situations i. e. influence of the embedment depth, crack-width inftuence (fastening in cracked concrete), influence of the edge distance etc. Therefore, in the present study some results of the axisymmetric and three-dimensional numerical analysis of the headed studs embedded in plane concrete block are presented. Influence of different geometrical and material parameters have been studied employing finite element method and nonlocal microplane model. Comparison between experimental and numerical results indicate reasonable good agreement. Generally it has been observed that the failure mechanism is governed by fracture energy rather than by tensile strength of concrete. As a consequence, the size effect is strong and close to linear elastic fracture mechanics...|$|R
40|$|During an earthquake, {{reinforced}} concrete members {{in a building}} will suffer cracking that oscillates as the building dynamically deforms. Equipment that services the building, such as mechanical and electrical items, are anchored to these components, and therefore will be subjected to this dynamic environment. Despite understanding this practical loading situation, as well as recognizing that anchor load capacity is significantly reduced when an anchor is embedded in cracked concrete, there remains a gap in knowledge regarding the effect of anchorage behavior on nonstructural component response. In particular, the effect of dynamic cyclic cracking coupled with inertia-generated tension load cycling on the anchor and component response has not been studied to date. A new methodology involving experimental equipment and simulation tools is developed for investigating the seismic behavior of anchored nonstructural components and systems that accounts {{for the effects of}} simultaneous anchor tension load cycling and crack cycling on anchor behavior and anchored component response. To support the experimental ingredient of this work, a Cyclic Cracked Inertial Loading Rig (CCILR), Weighted Anchor Loading Laboratory Equipment (WALLE) system, and cracked concrete slabs, are designed and fabricated. Mounting the CCILR and WALLE onto a shake table results in a system that is able to simulate a concrete beam or slab from a building supporting an anchored nonstructural component. System-level shake table tests are conducted on floor mounted model nonstructural components anchored in cyclic cracks using epoxy, expansion, drop-in and <b>undercut</b> <b>anchors</b> to study the effect of a range of anchor types. A nonlinear, lumped hysteresis anchor model is implemented and used to simulate anchor load-displacement response for tension load cycling dominant applications. The anchor model is calibrated against single anchor tests and subsequently extended for use in a system model of the anchored nonstructural components for predicting maximum system response. It was determined that the load-displacement behavior of the anchorage, in particular, the ultimate displacement capacity of the anchor, {{plays an important role in}} the seismic response of tension load cycling dominated floor mounted nonstructural components. The experimental results also support the current code design philosophy for anchors, which specifies that either the anchor or the attachment should be ductile, or the anchor should be designed for a multiple of the expected load demand...|$|R

PREFACE Many structural details in current use by the Texas Sta. te Department of Highways and Public 'l 3 ansporta. tion (SDHPT) involve the use of anchor bolts, sometimes in retrofit applications. Examples are attqa. chment of traffic barriers to structures: attachment of bridge girders to bearing blocks, attachment of end fixtures to precast concrete components, and a. ttachment of steel members to existing concrete. Anchors are of different types: cast,-in-place, grouted, adhesive, expansion, or <b>undercut.</b> These <b>anchors</b> are now designed using procedures wllich are outdated and often erroneous. Recent investigations ha. ve suggested that various Texas SnIiPT designs involving anchor bolts are inconsistent and possibly unconserva. tive. In developing more rational design procedures for such connections, it was necessary to study the behavior of multiple-anchor connections involving flexible as well as rigid baseplates. This report describes such a study. Based on the results of this study, recomnlendations are given for th...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a vacuum-packaged resonant pressure sensor featured with high sensitivity and linearity using dual resonators. The frequency {{difference between these}} two resonators is used to represent pressure, so that the nonlinear responds of each resonator is eliminated and the sensitivity of the sensor is also improved at the same time. The sensitivities of the dual resonators were matched through improved diaphragm uniformity and controlled <b>anchor</b> <b>undercut,</b> which leaded to a better linear performance. With this method, the nonlinear error is reduced from 1. 3 % F. S. to 0. 2 % F. S. over the pressure range from 0 to 250 kPa. Furthermore, to achieve better performance, the micro resonators were wafer-level vacuum packaged with anodic bonding to provide the needed low damping environment and the stable reference pressure. Test results show that the pressure in the vacuum-packaged micro chamber of the sensor is less than 5 Pa and kept for 6 months with no drop...|$|R
40|$|The damage {{observation}} in recent seismic events (L’Aquila 2009, Chile 2010, Christchurch 2011, Tohoku 2011, Emilia 2012) helps {{in the identification}} of the critical aspects related to the response to earthquake of non-structural components (Miranda et al. 2012). Generally these elements are included in buildings and may belong to the architectural system, to the utility system or to the building content. The failure of the non-structural components can represent a significant danger for life safety and leads to relevant economic losses and this also contributes in amounting to a severe impact for the society (Miranda et al. 2012). This thesis contains the results of an experimental campaign which had the aim of evaluating different typologies of post-installed anchors under seismic actions. The mentioned topic is considered of importance for the central role of these devices in anchoring non-structural elements in order to avoid failures and damages which can cause danger for life safety, huge economic loss and lack of functionality in a building after an earthquake occurs. (Taghavi and Miranda 2003; ATC 69 2008). During an earthquake the non-structural components should withstand to relevant inertial forces, transferred through the connection to the structural elements (beams, slabs, columns, walls) or often to other non-structural elements, such as infill walls. In many cases those connections are realized by means of post-installed anchors which should be designed properly in order to ensure a good behaviour to the seismic actions (Makris and Black 2001; Naumoski et al. 2002; Solomos and Berra 2006; Hoehler et al. 2011). Among all the requirements the reliability in terms of failure modes and strength of post-installed anchors results to be fundamental to obtain a valid design in the dynamic field. For instance the design of fire protection systems in schools, medical equipment in hospitals, masterpieces displayed in museums need an in-depth knowledge on the performance of anchors to use. Such knowledge should cover both the resistance for life safety limit state and the admissible displacements that allow the element functionality for serviceability limit state. The purpose of the experimental campaign presented within this research is to study the seismic behaviour of various anchoring systems through shaking table tests. Two cross-shaped structures were built at full scale, one consisted of concrete walls and one of a RC framed structure with masonry infill panels. Two different conditions were investigated in the case of fasteners installed in concrete, namely non-cracked and cracked support. Poroton® hollow bricks were used to build the specimen with masonry infill walls. Tri-axial shaking table tests were designed {{on the basis of the}} standard AC 156 (2010) which provides a test setup for the seismic certification of non-structural components by shaking table tests. The experiments were realized by subsequent signals scaled at a growing ZPA (Zero Period Acceleration) to study the effects induced on the specimens at increasing seismic intensity. The results allowed the overall seismic behaviour of each fastening element to be investigated, especially in terms of failure mode, maximum sustained acceleration and anchor slippage from support. The influence of cracks on these aspects was also deepened for the concrete structural unit. The test plan also allowed a complete comparison among different anchoring methodologies, such as mechanical, chemical and <b>undercut</b> <b>anchors.</b> Some recent studies (Rieder 2009; Watkins 2011; Mahrenholtz et al. 2012) focused on the seismic assessment of metal anchors in concrete by means of shake-table testing, whereas the use of fasteners in masonry and the behaviour of plastic anchors in general were not exhaustively investigated until now (Algin 2007; Sinica et al. 2010). Nevertheless these are two fields of interest because of their widespread presence in constructions. Therefore during the experimental study a particular attention has been paid to the issues of plastic anchors and installations in masonry. ...|$|R
