The poemwhich {{seems to have}} been inspired by Lucretius's Epicurean poem De rerum naturaespouses a Stoic, deterministic <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> universe overseen by a god and governed by reason. The fifth book of the Astronomica features a lacuna, which has led to debate about the original size of the poem; some scholars have argued that whole books have been lost over the years, whereas others believe only a small section of the work is missing.|$|E

25|$|It is {{possible}} by bond valence calculations {{to estimate how}} great a contribution a given oxygen atom is making to the assumed valence of uranium.

25|$|Chinese input {{methods are}} methods that allow a {{computer}} user to input Chinese characters. Most, if not all, Chinese input methods fall {{into one of}} two categories: phonetic readings or root shapes. Methods under the phonetic category usually are easier to learn but are less efficient, thus resulting in slower typing speeds because they typically require users to choose from a list of phonetically similar characters for input; whereas methods under the root shape category allow very precise and speedy input but have a difficult learning curve because they often require a thorough <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> character's strokes and composition.|$|E

This notion is also described as looping effects or feedback effects in cognition and culture, whereby the causal <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> particular social group changes the very character of the group, leading to further change in the phenomenon under investigation.|$|E

50|$|Lakoff {{tries to}} resolve these {{difficulties}} through a model in which liberals and conservatives are shown to have different and contradictory worldviews.

Nonetheless, Lakoff claims {{that all of these}} differences center around the two sides' respective <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single concept - the ideal nuclear family.|$|R
25|$|In {{more complex}} compounds, there is {{additional}} error since electronegativity {{depends on the}} molecular environment of an atom. Also, the energy estimate can be only used for single, not for multiple bonds. The energy of formation of a molecule containing only single bonds then can be approximated from an electronegativity table, and depends on the constituents and sum of squares of differences of electronegativities of all pairs of bonded atoms. Such a formula for estimating energy typically has relative error of order of 10%, but {{can be used to}} get a rough qualitative idea and <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> molecule.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{advances}} in personalized medicine rely on technology that confirms a patient's fundamental biology, DNA, RNA, or protein, which ultimately leads to confirming disease. For example, personalised {{techniques such as}} genome sequencing can reveal mutations in DNA that influence diseases ranging from cystic fibrosis to cancer. Another method, called RNA-seq, can show which RNA molecules are involved with specific diseases. Unlike DNA, levels of RNA can change {{in response to the}} environment. Therefore, sequencing RNA can provide a broader <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> person’s state of health. Recent studies have linked genetic differences between individuals to RNA expression, translation, and protein levels.|$|E
25|$|The {{inverted}} pendulum is {{a classic}} problem in dynamics and control theory and is widely used as a benchmark for testing control algorithms (PID controllers, state space representation, neural networks, fuzzy control, genetic algorithms, etc.). Variations on this problem include multiple links, allowing {{the motion of the}} cart to be commanded while maintaining the pendulum, and balancing the cart-pendulum system on a see-saw. The inverted pendulum is related to rocket or missile guidance, where the center of gravity is located behind the center of drag causing aerodynamic instability. The <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> similar problem can be shown by simple robotics {{in the form of a}} balancing cart. Balancing an upturned broomstick on the end of one's finger is a simple demonstration, and the problem is solved by self-balancing personal transporters such as the Segway PT, the self-balancing hoverboard and the self-balancing unicycle.|$|E
