Coatings for weatherstripping must adhere {{to all of}} these weatherstrip materials.

In vehicles without coated weatherstripping, the weatherstripping is much more likely to cause the above-mentioned issues along with others such as rust following premature failure of the paint. That some cars have non-coated weatherstripping is surprising, given that the cost of the coating is less than US$1 to US$3 per vehicle, whereas the rubber and steel is tens of dollars; an entire car set of weatherstripping may be worth US$100 to US$300 in the total cost of the vehicle, which includes all labor and costs of the manufacturing equipment.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the {{photodegradation}} {{mechanism of}} PMIA under ultraviolet light {{is described in}} detail. Due {{to the presence of}} amide groups, the molecular chains are easily to be broken by exposure to ultra-violet light, which leads to the significant drop of the PMIA’s mechanical performance and meanwhile the fiber’s color becomes dark. To improve the UV resistance performance of PMIA, two methods have been discussed. The first method is melt-mixing, by adding UV absorbers to PMIA, such as benzophenone, triazine, benzotriazole and hindered anime etc. These UV absorbers consume the ultraviolet light’s energy and protect polymeric and other light-sensitive materials from degradation by sunlight or UV. The second method is adding monomers with <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>resistance</b> during the polymerization. This is a promising solution allowing better structure stability of PMIA...|$|E

The mutations in daf- 16 did not alter the reduced fertility of spe- 26 and interestingly a daf- 16 mutant is more fertile than wild type.
