5000|$|For all {{his many}} unlikable and contemptible characteristics, Brent {{is not without}} redeeming merit and is largely {{depicted}} as a tragic figure, increasingly so as the show progresses: a lonely and somewhat forlorn man who places too much value on his <b>unrewarding</b> <b>job.</b> At several points, the audience is prompted to feel sympathetic towards Brent. This {{is especially true in}} the final episode of the second series [...] - [...] as Brent faces redundancy [...] - [...] and in parts of the Christmas special where he is seen struggling with life after losing his job and his fifteen minutes of fame (thus acknowledging that the supposed [...] "documentary" [...] filmed at Wernham-Hogg has been shown on television). These are the few times Brent is seen trying to hold on {{in the face of a}} somewhat bleak situation. Brents most desperate and depressing moment may be when he is banned from turning up unannounced at his old office when he no longer works there. Brent claims that his presence is good for morale and in perhaps his saddest moment he asks all of the staff to come out with him for a drink to which no one responds, his request descends into begging as he offers multiple days as options only to realize that no one wants anything to do with him at all, eventually prompting Tim to take him up on his offer out of pity. Brents future appears happier at the end of the Christmas special, when his lively and attractive blind date appears to genuinely enjoy his company. In the final scene, Brent also succeeds in achieving what he failed to do for the whole series up to that point: he makes the staff laugh. The Christmas special also reveals that Brent owns a pet Labrador retriever called Nelson, which he named after Nelson Mandela. The fact that Brent brought the dog to the office suggests that he may have bought the dog in an attempt to enhance his personal image in the eyes of his former employees and to steal some spotlight from the more well-liked Neil Godwin.|$|E
40|$|Feminist {{philosophers}} do {{not take}} well to criticism, and while many scholars are appalled {{at the idea of}} an academic field adhering to a controversial political philosophy and pursuing a controversial agenda within the academy, very few have been willing to take on the daunting and <b>unrewarding</b> <b>job</b> of examining and criticizing the feminists’ arguments and assumptions. In consequence, a feminist philosophy that is inspiring the successful effort to transform the American academy goes on virtually unchallenged. In this paper I will briefly be discussing some serious moral and pedagogic weaknesses of feminist philosophy. My intentions are to initiate discussion on some important and controversial topics. The hope is that others will enter the fray and that a more open and less diffident debate will ensue...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} few decades, sport {{organizations}} have undergone {{a major change in}} their management practices as they are expected to become more and more formal and professional-like. Despite this pressure, human resource managers should give more attention to the retention function in human resource management systems. As employees are the lifeline of sport organizations, much emphasis should be placed on preventing their voluntary turnover. Utilizing qualitative and inductive grounded theory building methods this study aims to provide invaluable information to sport managers about why employees leave or remain in sport organizations. Given the scant research on turnover and retention in sport organizations, this study addresses the questions: “What factors influence voluntary employee turnover intentions in swimming clubs, and what are the top factors that drive employee retention in such sport organizations?” Data were collected via semistructured interviews with eleven instructors of a local swimming club. The data analysis produced two models, one indicating the possible reasons for voluntary turnover in sport organizations, and the other possible retention factors in those organizations. The findings suggest that a challenging job, unsatisfying work environment, and an <b>unrewarding</b> <b>job</b> were amongst the common reasons for intended turnover of key employees. In contrast, a good person-job fit, well-managed organization, and value of the job were some of the factors that were thought to enhance employee retention. The findings of this study are discussed in the context of extant literature and implications for management practice and future research are described. All in all, the findings of this current study increase understanding about the turnover intentions and retention practices in sport organizations...|$|E
30|$|The delinking {{of public}} {{employment}} and rent distribution would make wealth-sharing broader, less exclusive, less discretionary, {{and much less}} distortionary in terms of labor market incentives. Incentives provided by a citizens’ income would increase citizens’ private employment. With unconditional cash grants, citizens {{would not have to}} take on idle, often <b>unrewarding</b> government <b>jobs</b> to share in the country’s wealth but would be free to pursue their own preferences, including on the private labor market. Although the size of the private employment effect would depend on grant level as well as prevailing wage levels, it is clear that with prospects of an easy public job more remote, at least some citizens would seek other sources of work income.|$|R
40|$|Lean {{construction}} is considered {{from a human}} resource management (HRM) perspective. It is contended that the UK construction sector is characterised by an institutionalised regressive approach to HRM. In the face of rapidly declining recruitment rates for built environment courses, the dominant HRM philosophy of utilitarian instrumentalism does little to attract the intelligent and creative young people that the industry so badly needs. Given this broader context, {{there is a danger}} that an uncritical acceptance of lean construction will exacerbate the industry's reputation for <b>unrewarding</b> <b>jobs.</b> Construction academics have strangely ignored the extensive literature that equates lean production to a HRM regime of control, exploitation and surveillance. The emphasis of lean thinking on eliminating waste and improving efficiency makes it easy to absorb into the best practice agenda because it conforms to the existing dominant way of thinking. 'Best practice' is seemingly judged by {{the extent to which it}} serves the interests of the industry's technocratic elite. Hence it acts as a conservative force in favour of maintaining the status quo. In this respect, lean {{construction is}} the latest manifestation of a long established trend. In common with countless other improvement initiatives, the rhetoric is heavy in the machine metaphor whilst exhorting others to be more efficient. If current trends in lean construction are extrapolated into the future the ultimate destination may be uncomfortably close to Aldous Huxley's apocalyptic vision of a Brave New World. In the face of these trends, the lean construction research community pleads neutrality whilst confining its attention to the rational high ground. The future of lean construction is not yet predetermined. Many choices remain to be made. The challenge for the research community is to improve practice whilst avoiding the dehumanising tendencies of high utilitarianism. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{character}} {{begins by}} narrating {{the present state}} of his life: his <b>unrewarding,</b> superfluous bureaucratic <b>job,</b> the relative wealth he enjoys, and his successes in the drag queen beauty contests. It moves on to his memories of his troubled childhood in the Caribbean Region of Colombia. By the time he has transformed, he enjoys moments of temporary happiness as he wins a contest. This concludes with sadness, as he recalls the solitude and emptiness of his life. The final section of the monologue, from which the title of the play is taken, expresses the nihilism that has come to invade the character's attitudes.|$|R
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1912, {{in search of a}} change from his <b>unrewarding</b> {{clerical}} <b>job,</b> Cardus applied for the post of assistant cricket coach at Shrewsbury School, citing his bowling averages in Manchester club cricket. He reasoned that, by living frugally during the Shrewsbury summers, {{he would be able to}} finance his winter studies of music and literature. His application was successful, and in May 1912 he began his duties. He worked initially under Attewell, a former Nottinghamshire professional, and later under the Yorkshire and England cricketer Ted Wainwright. Cardus established good working relations with both of these, but identified most closely with Cyril Alington, the school's headmaster: [...] "Because of Alington I call myself... an old Salopian". Alington first detected Cardus's intellectual potential when he found him reading a copy of Gilbert Murray's translation of Euripides's drama Medea. In August 1914, in addition to his cricketing duties he became Alington's secretary, after the previous incumbent joined the army at the outbreak of war; Cardus was rejected for military service because of his poor eyesight.|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the findings of}} a study into the experiences of NESB migrant women in the workforce. The fieldwork, which involved interviewing over one hundred immigrant women living and working in Sydney, was carried out between October 1988 and February 1989. The study also involved an extensive review of Australian and international literature on immigrant women in the workforce and the analysis of recent census and labour force survey data. The study focussed particularly on the experiences of newly arrived migrant women and examined many aspects of women 2 ̆ 7 s employment experiences in Australia including the relationship between women 2 ̆ 7 s pre-migration histories, their participation in the workforce in Australia and their domestic and family responsibilities. Although economic and social conditions in Australia have changed considerably in the post-war period, the study found that the continuities in the lives of women immigrants arriving in Australia in the 1950 s and 1960 s and those arriving today were more marked than the differences. It would seem that their place in the economy has altered little, and that employment continues to play the key role in structuring women 2 ̆ 7 s lives despite the development of an increased role for the state through ethnic affairs policies. Little evidence was found to support the theory that immigrants 2 ̆ 7 work force experiences reflect their pre-migration human capital endowments. Instead, we found that women from a variety of different backgrounds finished up, after emigrating to Australia, in similarly low status, unpleasant and <b>unrewarding</b> <b>jobs</b> - jobs which for many represented substantial downward mobility. These women experienced the segmentation of the labour market as a constraining framework, directing them towards certain types of jobs and limiting their opportunities to move out of them. The report presents fresh evidence of immigrant women 2 ̆ 7 s employment-related problems, many of which have been documented previously. Unemployment emerges as the greatest difficulty encountered by newly arrived women in Australia today. In the last chapter, recommendations in the areas of vocational guidance and training, equal employment opportunity, work conditions, women 2 ̆ 7 s participation in trade unions and childcare and family support are made. A reflection on the research methodology used in this study, and alternatives to it, concludes the report...|$|R
5000|$|... "Merck’s {{behavioral}} psychopharmacology screening program finally identified one highly {{promising new}} antidepressant. Code named MK-202, the chemical increased lever-pressing work output under {{a range of}} conditions, in seemingly more adaptive ways than amphetamine. For instance, in the “strained fixed-ratio” test, designed to measure “an animal’s ability to handle an overly large workload with inadequate motivation,” MK-202 performed better than dextroamphetamine. Here, hungry rats were given a drop of condensed milk only after pressing a lever two hundred times {{in response to a}} light signal. However, {{in the middle of their}} heavy and under-rewarded task a second light would turn on intermittently, and if they immediately responded by pressing a second lever they would get a milk drop instantly. Thus, this experiment measured both willingness to do “a particularly long and tedious job” as well as “alertness” to a second stimulus, according to Merck researchers. The rats on amphetamine performed well on the repetitive task but tended to miss the second stimulus; not so the rats on MK-202. Given the similarity between the rat’s situation and the repetitive work that most people must endure to make a living, a drug that increased lever pressing without producing unresponsiveness would seem a likely antidepressant—provided we accept that inefficiency in <b>unrewarding</b> <b>jobs</b> indicates psychiatric depression.""This implicit identification of impaired work efficiency with depressive illness, inscribed in the use of amphetamine-boosted lever pressing as the benchmark that subsequent antidepressants had to meet, applied to the highest level executive type of work also. (The business world is called a “rat race” with reason!) This is evident from another test, designed to measure a rat’s capacity to perform complex tasks. Here, to get a reward, rats had to press a lever rapidly when a white light was on, slowly when a red light was on, and not at all when both lights were on. The rats on amphetamine pressed their levers fast no matter what lights were on, but the rats on MK-202 only pressed fast when high speed was rewarded. In these and a half a dozen other experiments with trained rats subject to diabolically ingenious “reinforcement schedules” (that is, particular programs of reward and punishment), MK-202 outperformed amphetamine for boosting work output, maximizing reward, and minimizing punishment, particularly when tasks were both difficult and unrewarding. A more promising antidepressant drug candidate could hardly be imagined, and in January 1960 the behavioral psychopharmacology unit passed it on for human testing as an antidepressant, with its highestrecommendation." ...|$|R
50|$|Born in Hyde Park, New York, in 1813, he {{was named}} after American naval heroes, Commodores Oliver Hazard Perry, Matthew Perry (naval officer) and Thomas MacDonough. Little is known of his early life, but {{in his early thirties}} he left his <b>unrewarding</b> law office <b>job</b> and routine east coast lifestyle. In 1846, he headed south to New Orleans. There he met {{manifest}} destiny evangelists William McKendree Gwin and Robert J Walker who fervently believed that America should dominate the North American continent. When news of the California gold rush reached New Orleans, Gwin went west with the aim of becoming California's first (Democrat) senator. Collins followed on deciding to mine not gold but the miners. He tried his hand as a lawyer in Sonora. Records reveal that he took part in seven cases, lost six and won the other by default. He turned to business and helped start the American Russian Commercial Company with Gwin. This started with the opportunistic aim of shipping ice from the Arctic to San Francisco.|$|R
