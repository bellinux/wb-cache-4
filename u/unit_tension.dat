40|$|ABSTRACT Comparative {{energetics}} {{of chicken}} latissimus dorsi muscles, tonic anterior (ALD) and phasic posterior (PLD), were investigated by measuring initial heat production. Heat components were analyzed {{in terms of}} the equation: E = A + W + apr(EL) + f(P, t) As the muscles were stretched by increments, heat produced in isometric twitches and tetani decreased in a linear fashion. Two processes are involved: one tension independent, the activation heat, or A; and the other tension dependent, Wi + ap(ZL) + f(P, t). In twitches, A, per <b>unit</b> <b>tension,</b> is equivalent in the PLD and ALD. Tension-dependent heat, per <b>unit</b> <b>tension,</b> is greater in the PLD due to Wi; but tension-time-related heat, f(P, t), per <b>unit</b> <b>tension,</b> is similar in both muscles. In tetanic contractions, differences in A and f(P, t), per <b>unit</b> <b>tension,</b> are attributed to the greater V,. in the PLD. The differences in the energetics of isometric contractions in the PLD and ALD, therefore, can be explained by inherent differences in tension development, compliance, and myosin and reticular ATPase activities. Data from isotonic twitches were quantified by means of the equivalent tension technique. Both muscles exhibited an extra heat associated with shortening, aFp(L). In the PLD, the ratio a/Pot is greater; it is load independent and 12 the value of al/P in both muscles. Enthalpy efficiency, W. + Wil/E, is comparable in both muscles. A Fenn effect is observed only when isotonic energy liberation is compared to a decreasing isometric energy expenditure base line...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn adult {{mammalian}} skeletal muscles, {{fast and}} slow muscle fibers are selectively innervated by single inputs from corresponding motor neuron types, {{giving rise to}} fast and slow motor units. At birth, however, muscle fibers are polyinnervated, and connections between motor neurons and muscle fibers are not as specific as those found in adults. Excess synapses are removed {{during the first few}} postnatal weeks. In addition to changes in the degree of polyinnervation, motor unit types undergo maturation in their contractile properties. In this study, we have investigated the maturation of motor unit types during postnatal synapse elimination in the rabbit soleus muscle. The ratio of twitch tension to tetanic tension in a motor unit is an indication of its contractile type. Our results indicate that during synapse elimination, the twitch/tetanus ratios for fast motor units increase while those for slow motor units decrease. The ratio of motor <b>unit</b> <b>tension</b> at polyinnervated ages to that at singly innervated ages has previously been used to estimate the degree of polyinnervation for fast versus slow muscle fibers. We found that twitch and tetanic tension yield conflicting estimates of polyinnervation. This discrepancy was resolved on the basis of intracellular recordings of endplate potentials. Using latencies to endplate potentials as an indicator of muscle fiber type, we found that fast and slow muscle fibers are polyinnervated to a similar extent during both early and intermediate stages of synapse elimination, suggesting that specific tension, and not polyinnervation, changes differently in fast versus slow muscle fibers. These changes ate consistent with those we found in twitch/tetanus ratios. Furthermore, these intracellular recordings suggest a high degree of specificity at birth, which is further refined during synapse elimination...|$|E
40|$|The {{nervous system}} {{contains}} specific connections reflecting {{different types of}} projection patterns. Some of these projections have a topographic arrangement, while others have a diffuse pattern. Projections from spinal cord motor pools to different muscles are topographic. At a finer scale, patterns of projections within several muscles are topographic. These muscles tend to be flat and/or segmented. This thesis presents {{an investigation of the}} projection pattern in the innervation of the rabbit soleus muscle, which is compact and has only one tendon of origin and one tendon of insertion. Using intracellular recording of endplate potentials, tension overlap between pairs of ventral root filaments, and retrograde labeling of motor neurons following small injections of horseradish peroxidase into different regions within the muscle, it was shown that the soleus receives diffuse innervation from the spinal cord. It is thus likely that topography is related to muscle function, and that it correlates with spatial heterogeneity within muscles. Another type of specificity in connections to muscles is that between fast and slow motor neurons and their corresponding muscle fiber types. These connections form distinct types of motor units. We have investigated the maturation of motor unit types during postnatal synapse elimination. The ratio of motor <b>unit</b> <b>tension</b> at polyinnervated ages to that at singly innervated ages has been used to estimate the degree of polyinnervation for fast versus slow muscle fibers. Twitch and tetanic tension yield conflicting results. This contradiction was resolved using latencies to endplate potentials as an indicator of muscle fiber type. We found that fast and slow muscle fibers are polyinnervated to the same extent during both early and intermediate stages of synapse elimination, implying that specific tension, and not polyinnervation, changes differently in fast versus slow muscle fibers. These changes are consistent with those found in twitch/tetanus ratios. During synapse elimination, the twitch/tetanus ratios for fast motor units increase while those for slow motor units decrease. Furthermore, these intracellular recordings suggest a high degree of specificity at birth, which is further refined during synapse elimination. ...|$|E

40|$|We have {{examined}} the relationship between tension, an intrinsic stimulator of axonal elongation, and the culture substrate, an extrinsic regulator of axonal elongation. Chick sensory neurons were cultured on three substrata: (a) plain tissue culture plastic; (b) plastic treated with collagen type IV; and (c) plastic treated with laminin. Calibrated glass needles were used to increase the tension loads on growing neurites. We found that growth cones on all substrata failed to detach when subjected to two to threefold and in some cases 5 - 10 -fold greater tensions than their self-imposed rest tension. We conclude that adhesion to the substrate does not limit the tension exerted by growth cones. These data argue against a "tug-of-war" model for substrate-mediated guidance of growth cones. Neurite elongation was experimentally induced by towing neurites with a force-calibrated glass needle. On all substrata, towed elongation rate was proportional to applied tension above a threshold tension. The proportionality between elongation rate and tension can be regarded as the growth sensitivity of the neurite to tension, i. e., its growth rate per <b>unit</b> <b>tension.</b> On this basis, towed growth on all substrata can be described by the simple linear equation: elongation rate = sensitivity x (applied tension - tension threshold) The numerical values of tension thresholds and neurite sensitivities varied widely among different neurites. On all substrata, thresholds varied from near zero to greater than 200 mudynes, with some tendency for thresholds to cluster between 100 and 150 mudynes. Similarly, the tension sensitivity of neurites varied between 0. 5 and 5. 0 microns/h/mudyne. The lack of significant differences among sensitivity or threshold values on the various substrata suggest to use that the substratum does not affect the internal "set points" of the neurite for its response to tension. The growth cone of chick sensory neurons is known to pull on its neurite. The simplest cytomechanical model would assume that both growth cone- mediated elongation and towed growth are identical as far as tension input and elongation rate are concerned. We used the equation above and mean values for thresholds and sensitivity from towing experiments to predict the mean growth cone-mediated elongation rate based on mean rest tensions. These predictions are consistent with the observed mean values...|$|E

40|$|Loading–unloading {{tests were}} carried out on uncracked (as {{delivered}} from the factory) and cracked (after the first loading–unloading cycle was completed) grandstand terrace units. The variation of parameters, such as displacements and strains, with the applied load was recorded and presented in a graphical form.

The predominant mode of failure {{was found to be}} cracking initiated at the soffit of the <b>units</b> (<b>tension</b> zone) and mainly around the symmetry line (where maximum bending stresses congregate). These cracks propagated gradually towards the top.

A large portion of the horizontal part of the unit (tread) followed closely the behaviour of the riser, however, to reveal tension rather than compression at the top. This could have some implications for the design of the units. It was concluded that present methods and procedures of evaluating and designing precast concrete terrace units are not integral.

In control mice, motor <b>unit</b> tetanic <b>tension</b> averaged 4. 98 % of whole muscle tension, corresponding to twenty motor units. Two out of fifteen dystrophic mice exhibited an apparent {{decrease in the number}} of motor units, but the data from the remaining thirteen mice indicated no change in relative motor unit size, and hence in the number of motor units. The two mice in which changes were seen were the most severely affected and it is suggested that the apparent reduction in the number of units might be due to some units becoming so small as to be unmeasurable. No evidence was obtained for a population of units with normal characteristics within the dystrophic muscles. There was no clear relationship between tetanic tension and the time to peak tension or to half-relaxation in units from control mice. In dystrophic mice, however, a significant correlation was seen. This possibly reflects two simultaneous effects of the dystrophic process, a loss of tension accompanied by slowing of the twitch...|$|R

40|$|A {{wide range}} of motor unit sizes exists in each frog sartorius, with values of tetanus and twitch {{tensions}} extending over 62 - and 400 -fold ranges, respectively. These differences primarily represent differences in the number, rather than the size, of muscle fibres in each motor <b>unit.</b> Tetanus-to-twitch <b>tension</b> ratios varied markedly between different motor units, ranging from 1. 5 to over 190. Because directly stimulated muscle fibres have tetanus/twitch ratios no larger than 3, it is concluded that high tetanus/twitch ratios arise from recruitment of muscle fibres during the tetanus which respond with only subthreshold depolarization during a twitch. Small motor units, as judged either by their twitch or tetanus tension, were associated with higher tetanus/twitch ratios, suggesting that the average safety margin of a motor unit increases with the motor unit's size. Indeed, when the tetanus/twitch ratio of a motor unit is {{used to determine the}} fraction of fibres in the unit with subthreshold neuromuscular junctions, it is observed that there is a direct linear relationship between the size of the motor unit and its over-all efficacy of synaptic transmission. Measurements of the effects of changes in calcium concentration on motor <b>unit</b> twitch <b>tension</b> confirmed the last conclusion. Furthermore, this analysis revealed that large motor units, although having a {{wide range of}} transmission safety margins, are largely comprised of junctions of uniformly high safety margin. In motor units of smaller size, synaptic strengths become more evenly distributed over a wide range of values. Small motor units had consistently longer twitch rise-times than did larger units. This decrease in rise-time with motor unit size paralleled the decrease in tetanus/twitch ratios, raising questions about the regulation of muscle fibre contraction kinetics...|$|R

40|$|Tension {{developed}} by single motor units and bundles of motor units {{has been recorded}} from the slow, non-twitch portion of the iliofibularis muscle of the toad Bufo marinus. Evidence was sought {{for the presence of}} individual muscle fibres within a motor unit which remained less than fully activated when the axon was maximally stimulated, i. e. at a rate and duration sufficient to produce maximum tension. When two motor units were stimulated separately and together, one at a low rate and the other at a maximal rate, the tension recorded on combined stimulation was greater than the sum of individual tensions, i. e. combined stimulation acted to 'facilitate' tension in a proportion of fibres. Adding the anticholinesterase eserine to the solution bathing the muscle produced a large increase in individual motor <b>unit</b> <b>tensions</b> but a rather smaller increase during combined stimulation of several axons. This suggested that in normal solution, maximally stimulating a single axon left many muscle fibres less than fully activated. When the local anaesthetic lignocaine was added to the bathing solution, tension in response to nerve stimulation fell, presumably because of impulse blockade in small terminal branches of the axon. However tension fell more steeply for single motor units than for combinations of motor units, again, we propose, because single motor units contain a larger fraction of incompletely activated fibres whose tension output depends critically on the level of activation. Overlap between two motor units {{is a measure of the}} proportion of fibres innervated by both axons. When overlap was measured over a range of different muscle lengths and using contractions of different durations, evidence was obtained in support of the notion that tension output of some muscle fibres was less than maximum not only because the fibre received too sparse an innervation to achieve a sufficient over-all level of depolarization but because they had been non-uniformly activated, leading to internal motion within the fibre and a consequent further drop in tension...|$|R

The variation of parameters, such as displacements and strains, with the applied load was recorded and presented in a graphical form. The reduction in stiffness of the units due to cracks was estimated from these graphs. The predominant mode of failure was found to be cracking initiated at the soffit of the <b>units</b> (<b>tension</b> zone) and mainly around the symmetry line (where maximum bending stresses are formed) and their gradual propagation to the top. The strain distribution across the depth of the vertical part of the terrace unit (beam) was found to be predominantly linear, displaying tension at the bottom and compression at the top. However, {{a large portion of the}} horizontal part of the unit (slab) followed closely the behaviour of the beam, to give tension rather than compression at the top. This could have some implications to the design of the units. The deformed shape of the units was significantly more complex than assumed in their initial design; displacing downwards and rotating about a longitudinal horizontal axis and at the same time, warping at the free slab corners, with further implications in their design. A series of finite element models were developed, depicting closely the true behaviour of the units and assisting with the recognition and study of one or two structural conditions that otherwise would not be easy to identify (such as, the formation of a 'bowl' at the central region of the units).

The formulation and numerical implementatio n of the implicit formula is much more complicated because it includes nonlinear iteration procedur e. Furthermore, {{it is not easy}} to show time reversibility in implicit formula. Thus for these reasons, it is necessary to develop explicit formula in MD unit cell simulation. We develop fully flexible explicit Nσ T ensemble MD simulation algorithm. It guarantees the preservation of extended Hamil tonian in real time domain and time reversibility. The numerical implementation is easy and relative ly simple since it does not require iteration process. It is established by using the splitting time integ ration. It separates flexible cell Hamiltonian into several terms corresponding to each Hamiltonian part, so the simple and completely explicit recursion formula was obtained. <b>Unit</b> cell <b>tension,</b> shear test for bulk material tension and shear tests are performed to demonstrate the validity and performance of the present explicit molecular dynamics scheme formulated through the spitting method. We compare the results of the explicit splitting time integration scheme with those of the implicit generalized leapfrog time integration scheme. The proposed explicit NT unit cell simulati on method should serve as a powerful tool in the prediction of the material behavior...|$|R
