25|$|Azali {{failed to}} {{consolidate}} power and reestablish {{control over the}} islands, which {{was the subject of}} international criticism. The African Union, under the auspices of President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa, imposed sanctions on Anjouan to help broker negotiations and effect reconciliation. The official name of the country was changed to the <b>Union</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Comoros</b> and a new system of political autonomy was instituted for each island, plus a union government for the three islands was added.|$|E
25|$|Politics of the Comoros {{takes place}} in a {{framework}} of a federal presidential republic, whereby the President of the Comoros is both head of state and head of government, and of a multi-party system. The Constitution of the <b>Union</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Comoros</b> was ratified by referendum on 23 December 2001, and the islands' constitutions and executives were elected in the following months. It had previously been considered a military dictatorship, and the transfer of power from Azali Assoumani to Ahmed Abdallah Mohamed Sambi in May 2006 was a watershed moment as it was the first peaceful transfer in Comorian history.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> President <b>of</b> Anjouan is <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> Anjouan, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three islands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> <b>of</b> <b>Comoros.</b> <b>The</b> {{position}} was firstly established in 1997 after <b>the</b> Declaration <b>of</b> independence <b>of</b> Anjouan.

2500|$|The Comoros ( [...] ; , [...] ), officially the <b>Union</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Comoros</b> (Comorian: Udzima wa Komori, , [...] ), is a {{sovereign}} archipelago island {{nation in the}} Indian Ocean located at {{the northern end of}} the Mozambique Channel off the eastern coast of Africa between northeastern Mozambique and northwestern Madagascar. Other countries near the Comoros are Tanzania to the northwest and the Seychelles to the northeast. Its capital is Moroni, on Grande Comore. The <b>Union</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Comoros</b> has three official languages – Comorian, Arabic and French. The religion {{of the majority of the}} population is Islam.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2013 the <b>Union</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Comoros</b> {{became known}} for filing a {{referral}} to the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) regarding the events of [...] "the 31 May 2010 Israeli raid on the Humanitarian Aid Flotilla bound for [...] Gaza Strip." [...] In November 2014 the ICC Prosecutor eventually decided that the events did constitute war crimes but {{did not meet the}} gravity standards of bringing the case before ICC. The emigration rate of skilled workers was about 21.2% in 2000.|$|E
2500|$|The Comoros has {{repeatedly}} pressed {{its claim to}} Mayotte before the United Nations General Assembly, which adopted a series of resolutions under the caption [...] "Question of the Comorian Island of Mayotte", opining that Mayotte belongs to the Comoros under the principle that the territorial integrity of colonial territories should be preserved upon independence. As a practical matter, however, these resolutions have little effect {{and there is no}} foreseeable likelihood that Mayotte will become de facto part of the Comoros without its people's consent. More recently, the Assembly has maintained this item on its agenda but deferred it from year to year without taking action. Other bodies, including the Organization of African Unity, the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, have similarly questioned French sovereignty over Mayotte. To close the debate and to avoid being integrated by force in the <b>Union</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Comoros,</b> the population of Mayotte overwhelmingly chose to become an overseas department and a region of France in a 2009 referendum. The new status was effective on 31 March 2011 and Mayotte has been recognised as an outermost region by European Union on 1 January 2014. This decision integrates Mayotte in the French Republic legally « one and indivisible ».|$|E
