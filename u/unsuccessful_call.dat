50|$|The formula applies {{under the}} {{condition}} that an <b>unsuccessful</b> <b>call,</b> because the line is busy, is not queued or retried, but instead really vanishes forever. It is assumed that call attempts arrive following a Poisson process, so call arrival instants are independent. Further, it is assumed that the message lengths (holding times) are exponentially distributed (Markovian system), although the formula turns out to apply under general holding time distributions.|$|E
50|$|The {{call setup}} success rate in {{conventional}} (so-called land-line) networks is extremely high and is significantly above 99.9%. In mobile communication systems using radio channels the call setup success rate is lower and may range for commercial networks between 90% and 98% or higher. The {{main reasons for}} <b>unsuccessful</b> <b>call</b> setups in mobile networks are lack of radio coverage (either in the downlink or the uplink), radio interference between different subscribers, imperfections in {{the functioning of the}} network (such as failed call setup redirect procedures), overload of the different elements of the network (such as cells), etc.|$|E

5000|$|McCormick also {{hosted a}} show in the 1970s called Dialing for Dollars where random Bay Area people were called and asked to guess the [...] "Count and the Amount". The [...] "count" [...] was used to {{determine}} which person would be called. The host would pick a slip of paper from a drum containing pages from local phone books sliced into convenient sizes. At the beginning of the show, the count was determined by spinning two wheels, one of which resulted in a number and the other in [...] "top" [...] or [...] "bottom". If the count was, for instance, 3/top, the host would start {{at the top of the}} slip of phone book and count three numbers down from the top and call the resulting number. The [...] "amount" [...] was the amount of money to be won. It would start at $100 and increase by a fixed amount with every <b>unsuccessful</b> <b>call.</b> The calls were made during commercial breaks while the afternoon movie was being screened.|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} {{framework for}} the efficient evaluation {{of the performance of}} complete sharing (CS) and complete partitioning (CP) resource sharing policies under a newly proposed general channel management strategy for multi-class traffic in Low Earth Orbit-Mobile Satellite Systems (LEO-MSS) is presented. This strategy gives a higher priority to handover calls over new calls by combine the guard channel scheme, the queuing priority scheme and the sub-rating scheme in such a way to reduce the forced termination probability of handover calls with little impact on other system performance measure, such as new call blocking probability and <b>unsuccessful</b> <b>call</b> probability...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop an {{analytical}} threshold-based bandwidth allocation policy for 3 G multi-class cellular networks. We consider {{the effects of}} user mobility when the cellular network supports multiple classes of connections having different QoS bandwidth requirements. The policy gives priority to handoff connections over new calls and prioritizes between different classes of handoff connections according to their QoS constraints by assigning a maximum occupancy, i. e. a threshold, to each connection class. The policy can be modeled as a multidimension Markov chain, and therefore, a product form solution is provided. The QoS metrics – new call blocking probability, handoff call dropping probability, and probability of <b>unsuccessful</b> <b>call</b> completion- are derived. We show numerically that this policy improves the service quality by minimizing handoff dropping probability and maximizing the bandwidth utilization i. e. by minimizing the new call blocking probability. 1...|$|E
50|$|The {{primary reason}} for answer and {{disconnect}} supervision is for billing. The telephone company and the customer need an accurate accounting of calls. It is standard for telephone companies not to charge for unanswered or <b>unsuccessful</b> <b>calls.</b> All call detail records (CDRs) produced should indicate a call was unanswered or unsuccessful, and therefore, incur no charge from the billing system.|$|R

40|$|Survey {{practitioners}} are increasingly {{interested in how}} best to use paradata to improve data collection processes. One particular question is if {{it is possible to}} identify early on during fieldwork sample cases that may require a long time, and therefore a lot of financial and staff resources, until interviewing is completed. More specifically, we aim to identify cases with long <b>unsuccessful</b> <b>call</b> sequences. This paper models call record data predicting final call outcome and length of a call sequence. Separate binary and joint multinomial logistic models for the two outcomes are presented, accounting for the clustering of households within interviewers. Of particular interest is to identify explanatory variables that predict final outcome and length of a call sequence. The study uses data from Understanding Society, a large-scale UK longitudinal survey. The work has implications for responsive and adaptive survey designs. The results indicate that modelling outcome and length of a call sequence jointly improves the fit of the model. Outcomes of previous calls, in particular from the most recent call, are highly predictive. The timing of calls and interviewer observation variables, although significant in the models, only slightly improve the predictive power...|$|E

40|$|Unforeseen user intents {{can account}} for a {{significant}} portion of <b>unsuccessful</b> <b>calls</b> in an automatic voice response system. Discovering these unforeseen semantic intents usually requires expensive manual transcriptions. We propose a method to cluster the acoustics from logged calls by their estimated semantic intents. This is achieved through training a mixture of language models in an unsupervised manner. Each cluster is presented to the application developer with a suggested language model to cover the semantic intent of the data in that cluster. The application developer validates the cluster and its suggested language model, and then updates the application. A quantative evaluation on a corporate voice-dialer application shows that updating the application in this manner yields a relative 13. 4 % reduction in semantic error rate. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are three-fold. The first objective is to determine the awareness of the Muncie household to the generic product.

2500|$|Despite {{the praise}} from the England side, Pietersen {{claimed he was}} dropped from the Natal first team. Pietersen {{felt that this was}} due to the country's racial quota system, in which provincial sides were {{required}} to have at least four black players. Pietersen's view was that players should be judged on merit, and described it as [...] "heartbreaking" [...] when he was left out of the side, although he later reflected [...] "it turned out {{it was the best thing}} that could have happened". Pietersen has since firmly criticised the quota system, which he feels forced him out of the country of his birth. He has also criticised Graeme Smith, who became captain of the South African side in 2003, calling him [...] "an absolute muppet, childish and strange" [...] and that his behaviour [...] "leaves a lot to be desired". Smith opposed this, saying, [...] "I'm patriotic about my country, and that's why I don't like Kevin Pietersen. The only reason that Kevin and I have never had a relationship is because he slated South Africa". Pietersen's outspoken views published in his autobiography, Crossing the Boundary, in September 2006, and in an interview for the South African edition of GQ magazine, led to <b>unsuccessful</b> <b>calls</b> for an ICC investigation regarding bringing the game into disrepute.|$|R
