40|$|The problem {{solution}} on {{influence of}} mobile normal and torque loads on an infinitely long cylindrical shell in elastic inertial half-space has been obtained. The load functions {{are supposed to}} be developed in Fourier series by angular coordinate and Fourier integral by axial coordinate. The movement of shell is described by classical equation of thin shell theory, but elastic half-space is done by elasticity theory dynamic equations in Lame potentials that are solved by means of Fourier integral transformation method. The problem is a model for rock mass deflected mode calculation under inequality of dynamic loads transferred to each of rails in a cylindrical tunnel or under treatment facility's rotary motion in an <b>underground</b> <b>pipework...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{implementation}} of this policy will ensure that Council’s underground services (i. e. water, sewer and stormwater assets) are protected, from damage or loss of access that could be caused {{as a result of}} construction works. This policy is aimed at avoiding:- Structural damage to the water and sewerage pipes, {{as a result of the}} load from the structure being transferred to the underground service. This may cause the pipes to subside or fracture. Subsidence with consequent damage to the structure. Subsidence can occur when a pipeline breaks and the resultant flow of water reduces the bearing capacity of the surrounding soils. Barriers to access to manhole, maintenance shafts and inspection shafts, and the underground service. Future costs that could be incurred by having to remove and then replace structures that have been allowed to be built over or too close to underground services. An inconsistent approach to building over or near <b>underground</b> <b>pipework</b> throughout the Narrabri Shire Council area...|$|E

New building design priorities have been established in Australia that focus on reducing the consumption of both energy and water. The stormwater runoff from commercial buildings is one area in which much potential for improvement has been identified. Gone are the days where the only concern with roof runoff was to ensure its rapid removal from the site. The need to harvest this precious resource has been recognised and new technologies are emerging to resolve this issue. Siphonic roof drainage is a relatively new building services technology which has many benefits over conventional drainage systems. Building designers and architects are specifying siphonic roof drainage systems on an increasing number of commercial and industrial buildings. For example, Sydney Olympic Stadium, the Norman Foster designed Chek Lap Kok airport in Hong Kong and the new International Terminal Buildings at Adelaide and Sydney airports all have siphonic roof systems. The benefits of these systems include, ability to quickly drain high intensity rainfall events, substantial cost reductions, virtual elimination of <b>underground</b> <b>pipework</b> and the opportunities for significant stormwater reuse options. This paper aims to provide an overview of the many benefits that are being realised by planners, building designers, engineers, architects, surveyors, contractors and owners by specifying a siphonic roof drainage system. Furthermore, it will examine the water conservation and reuse options that are possible with siphonic drainage and compare these to conventional roof and property drainage systems...|$|E
40|$|Siphonic roof {{drainage}} systems (SRDS ’ s) have been widespread used now for approximately 40 years and are an efficient method of removing rainwater rapidly from roofs. SRDS ’ s {{are designed to}} run full-bore, resulting in sub-atmospheric system pressures with high hydraulic driving heads and higher system flow velocities than conventionally guttered systems. Hence, SRDS ’ s normally require far fewer downpipes, and the depressurised conditions also mean {{that much of the}} collection pipework can be routed at a high level, thus reducing the extent of any <b>underground</b> <b>pipework.</b> But, they work properly at only one roof run-off rate and therefore suffer from sizing and operational problems including noise and vibration which limit their performance and adoption rate. Climate change is creating situations where normal ranges of rainfall intensity are being frequently exceeded, so the typical:storm ratios (r TS) are large increasing. Current SRDS ’ s typically operate within a small r TS range of 2. This may {{have an impact on the}} future uptake of SRDS ’ s. This paper describes the development of a novel SRDS which includes a small mobile cap at the roof of outlet appears to offer benefits and avoids sizing problems associated with current SRDS ’ s. The cap has the potential to avoid noise associated with making and breaking siphonic action through flow modulation. Laboratory scale tests demonstrate the basic feasibility of the cap system and indicate that the cap functions reliably. This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors. Basic on sizing and design optimiza - tion factors are suggested. The r TS range is increased from approximately 2 to approximately 6. </p...|$|E
