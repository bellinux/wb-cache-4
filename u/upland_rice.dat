5|$|Termites can {{be major}} {{agricultural}} pests, particularly in East Africa and North Asia, where crop losses can be severe (3–100% in crop loss in Africa). Counterbalancing {{this is the}} greatly improved water infiltration where termite tunnels in the soil allow rainwater to soak in deeply, which helps reduce runoff and consequent soil erosion through bioturbation. In South America, cultivated plants such as eucalyptus, <b>upland</b> <b>rice</b> and sugarcane can be severely damaged by termite infestations, with attacks on leaves, roots and woody tissue. Termites can also attack other plants, including cassava, coffee, cotton, fruit trees, maize, peanuts, soybeans and vegetables. Mounds can disrupt farming activities, {{making it difficult for}} farmers to operate farming machinery; however, despite farmers' dislike of the mounds, it is often the case that no net loss of production occurs. Termites can be beneficial to agriculture, such as by boosting crop yields and enriching the soil. Termites and ants can re-colonise untilled land that contains crop stubble, which colonies use for nourishment when they establish their nests. The presence of nests in fields enables larger amounts of rainwater to soak into the ground and increases the amount of nitrogen in the soil, both essential for the growth of crops.|$|E
25|$|To {{address the}} problem of erosion in upland rice-growing regions, the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) {{initiated}} a breeding program for perennial <b>upland</b> <b>rice</b> in the mid-1990s. Within just a few years, the program achieved significant progress. The Perennial <b>Upland</b> <b>Rice</b> project team used populations derived from crossing the rice plant Oryza sativa with two different distantly related perennials in the hopes {{that at least one of}} these strategies would enable genes from the perennial to be moved to the cultivated rice gene pool.|$|E
25|$|Several {{nematode}} species infect rice crops, causing {{diseases such}} as Ufra (Ditylenchus dipsaci), White tip disease (Aphelenchoide bessei), and root knot disease (Meloidogyne graminicola). Some nematode species such as Pratylenchus spp. are most dangerous in <b>upland</b> <b>rice</b> of {{all parts of the}} world. Rice root nematode (Hirschmanniella oryzae) is a migratory endoparasite which on higher inoculum levels will lead to complete destruction of a rice crop. Beyond being obligate parasites, they also decrease the vigor of plants and increase the plants' susceptibility to other pests and diseases.|$|E

25|$|The International Rice Research Institute conducts {{research}} into developing drought-tolerant rice varieties, including the varieties 5411 and Sookha dhan, currently being employed by {{farmers in the}} Philippines and Nepal respectively. In addition, in 2013 the Japanese National Institute for Agrobiological Sciences led a team which successfully inserted the DEEPER ROOTING 1 (DRO1) gene, from the Philippine <b>upland</b> <b>rice</b> variety Kinandang Patong, into the popular commercial rice variety IR64, giving rise to a far deeper root system in the resulting plants. This facilitates an improved ability for the rice plant to derive its required nutrients in times of drought via accessing deeper layers of soil, a feature demonstrated by trials which saw the IR64 + DRO1 rice yields drop by 10% under moderate drought conditions, compared to 60% for the unmodified IR64 variety.|$|E
25|$|The {{central area}} principally {{consists}} of Magallanes loam with streaks of Magallanes clay loam of sandy texture. This {{is recommended for}} diversified farming such as the cultivation of <b>upland</b> <b>rice,</b> corn, sugarcane, vegetables, coconut, coffee, mangoes and other fruit trees. The steep phase should be forested or planted to rootcrops. The eastern side of Cavite consists of Carmona clay loam with streaks of Carmona clay loam steep phase and Carmona sandy clay loam. This type of soil is granular with tuffaceaous material and concretions. It is hard and compact when dry, sticky and plastic when wet. This type of soil is planted to rice with irrigation or sugarcane without irrigation. Fruit trees such as mango, avocado and citrus are also grown {{in this type of}} soil. Guingua fine sandy loam is found along the lower part of Malabon and Alang-ilang River at Noveleta.|$|E

50|$|In United States {{agricultural}} policy, {{a marketing}} loan repayment provision is a loan settlement provision, first {{authorized by the}} Food Security Act of 1985 (P.L. 99-198), that allowed producers to repay nonrecourse loans at less than the announced loan rates whenever the world price or loan repayment rate for the commodity were less than the loan rate.

The positive and statistically significant coefficients of yield (YIELD) and vocational training (VOCT) in the pooled data suggest that welfare of the farming households is positively influenced by the yield and vocational training. In addition, income from rice production (RICINC), and off-farm income (OFFINC) exerted a positive and statistically {{significant effect on the}} households’ welfare in the pooled data and among the sub-population of the <b>upland</b> and lowland <b>rice</b> farming households. The years of formal education (YEDUC) and years of residence in the village, were positive and statistically significant in generating welfare improvement in the pooled data and among the lowland rice farming households.|$|R

2500|$|<b>Upland</b> <b>rice</b> {{is grown}} {{on more than}} [...] in the {{highlands}} of southern China and across southeast Asia. Because it is grown on steeply sloping soil without terracing, severe erosion results, and a given patch of land can economically produce rice for only {{a year or two}} before it must be allowed to return to natural vegetation—only to be cleared and re-sown to rice a few years later. Population increase and agricultural intensification is reducing the fallow period. This is a potent recipe for soil degradation. Were rice a perennial rather than an annual species, its continuously living roots and thick cover of vegetation would prevent such erosion, just as a planting of grass can prevent a roadside slope from washing away. Perennial rice could produce critically needed food year after year on the same plot of land without degrading the soil.|$|E
