In Corsica, a marble slab {{dedicated}} to him and Sergio Cresto was placed at the curve where Toivonen drove out. The memorial place always has an <b>unopened</b> <b>bottle</b> of Martini, which is a reference to Toivonen's Martini-sponsored Lancia factory team. A local resident puts new flowers by the slab every day. In July, the Rally Marca Trevigiana in Italy was titled [...] "Memorial Henri Toivonen" [...] in honour of Toivonen. The rally was stopped after a fatal accident on the fourth stage. In 1988, former rally driver and arguably the most successful female race car driver in history, Michèle Mouton, organised the first Race of Champions to commemorate Toivonen's death. The Race of Champions was originally restricted to rally drivers, but became even more popular {{with the introduction of}} Formula One and NASCAR stars. The Henri Toivonen Memorial Trophy is still awarded to the winner of the individual event every year.|$|E
500|$|RMS Titanic Inc. organizes {{large-scale}} exhibitions {{around the}} world of artifacts retrieved from the wreck site. After minor exhibitions were held in Paris and Scandinavia, the first major exhibition of recovered artifacts {{was held at the}} National Maritime Museum in 1994–95. It was hugely popular, drawing an average of 21,000 visitors a week during the year-long exhibition. Since then, RMS Titanic Inc. has established a large-scale permanent exhibition of Titanic artifacts at the Luxor hotel and casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. The [...] exhibit is the home of the [...] "Big Piece" [...] of the hull retrieved in 1998 and features conserved items including luggage, Titanics whistles, floor tiles and an <b>unopened</b> <b>bottle</b> of champagne. The exhibit includes a full-scale replica of the ship's Grand Staircase and part of the Promenade Deck, and even a mock-up of the iceberg. It also runs a traveling exhibition called Titanic: The Artifact Exhibition which has opened in various cities {{around the world}} and has been seen by over 20 million people. The exhibition typically runs for six to nine months featuring a combination of artifacts, reconstructions and displays of the ship, her passengers and crew and the disaster itself. In a similar fashion to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., visitors are given a [...] "boarding pass" [...] in the name of an individual passenger {{at the start of the}} exhibition.

60|$|It {{was five}} minutes to eight, and dinner had been laid at a little round table {{in the center of}} the room. There was a bowl of pink roses--Sophy's {{favorite}} flower--sent in from the florist's; the table was lighted by a pink-shaded lamp. John went around the room, turning out the other lights, until the apartment was hung with shadows save for the little spot of color in the middle. An <b>unopened</b> <b>bottle</b> of champagne stood in an ice-pail, and two specially prepared cocktails had been placed upon the little side-table. There were no more preparations to be made.|$|E
60|$|Stepping to the water's edge, Geddie hurled the <b>unopened</b> <b>bottle</b> far {{out into}} the sea. It {{disappeared}} for a moment, and then shot upward twice its length. Geddie stood still, watching it. The moonlight was so bright {{that he could see}} it bobbing up and down with the little waves. Slowly it receded from the shore, flashing and turning as it went. The wind was carrying it out to sea. Soon it became a mere speck, doubtfully discerned at irregular intervals; and then the mystery of it was swallowed up by the greater mystery of the ocean. Geddie stood still upon the beach, smoking and looking out upon the water.|$|E

According to the reporter, when questioned as to why she would reimburse the restaurant for a meal that had been paid for by MZM, Harris abruptly terminated the interview, and her spokesman later called and requested unsuccessfully that the story not be printed. The next day, Harris's campaign issued a statement that she had believed her campaign had reimbursed the restaurant, and that she had donated $100 [...] "which will more than adequately compensate for the cost of my beverage and appetizer". Harris also asserted that most {{of the cost of the}} meal was from Wade ordering several <b>unopened</b> <b>bottles</b> of wine to take home, although the management of the restaurant denies ever allowing anyone to take <b>unopened</b> <b>bottles</b> of wine off the premises, saying [...] "Why would we jeopardize our liquor license for the sake of selling a couple bottles of wine?" ...|$|R

60|$|Around him {{the small}} animals {{of the wood}} frolicked, and the jay called inquiringly, but he neither saw nor heard. He was himself but a gasping creature, with reason entirely engaged in the blind {{struggle}} which the physical organism was instinctively making to continue in its wonted ways. All the world and all his desires, save a longing for his fair young wife, were lost out of his mind, and he thought of Bertha only in a dim and formless way--feeling his need of her and dumbly wondering why she did not come. In final, desperate agony, he lifted the phial of strychnine to his lips, hoping that it might {{put an end to}} his suffering; but before this act was completed a sweet, devouring flood of forgetfulness swept over him, his hand dropped, and the <b>unopened</b> <b>bottle</b> rolled away out of his reach. Then the golden sunlight darkened out of his sky, and he died--as the desert lion dies--alone.|$|E

5000|$|The name {{derives from}} the {{distinction}} between types of licence which could be granted—a distinction now repealed in England and Wales, and repealed in Scotland in 2009. In England and Wales, the magistrates would formerly grant either an [...] "off" [...] licence permitting the sale of intoxicating liquor for consumption only off the premises, or an [...] "on" [...] licence permitting sale for consumption on the premises—which permitted, to a limited extent, off sales too: many public houses were permitted off sales, to sell sealed alcoholic drinks (e.g., <b>unopened</b> <b>bottles</b> of wine) for consumption elsewhere. A restaurant licence was an on-licence with a restaurant condition attached. Until 2009, in Scotland the types of licence were Hotel, Public House, Restricted Hotel, Restaurant, Entertainment, Off-Sale, and Refreshment licences. In Northern Ireland, there are numerous types of licence.|$|R
5000|$|A Burton Ale, {{which was}} rather special {{as it was}} never a commercially sold product. It was only given as a gift to Ballantine distributors, executives, and VIPs. It was a strong brew in the barleywine style, aged from 10-20 years in wood prior to <b>bottling.</b> Surviving <b>unopened</b> <b>bottles</b> are still bought, sold, and traded to this day among collectors, more than 60 years after being brewed. Because of the long aging and generous hopping as well as an ABV content {{comparable}} to barleywines, the beer had remarkable keeping qualities. Still, {{it could be argued that}} since the beer was already long aged prior to bottling, it was probably already at its peak when finally bottled. Reports of modern-day tastings indicate that properly handled vintage bottles of this unique beer can still yield a complex (though somewhat faded) taste experience.|$|R

40|$|An {{outbreak}} of Acanthamoeba keratitis, a rare, potentially blinding, corneal infection, was {{detected in the}} United States in 2007; cases had been increasing since 2004. A case-control {{study was conducted to}} investigate the outbreak. We interviewed 105 case-patients from 30 states and 184 controls matched geographically and by contact lens use. Available contact lenses, cases, solutions, and corneal specimens from case-patients were cultured and tested by molecular methods. In multivariate analyses, case-patients had significantly greater odds of having used Advanced Medical Optics Complete Moisture Plus (AMOCMP) solution (odds ratio 16. 9, 95 % confidence interval 4. 8 - 59. 5). AMOCMP manufacturing lot information was available for 22 case-patients, but none of the lots were identical. Three <b>unopened</b> <b>bottles</b> of AMOCMP tested negative for Acanthamoeba spp. Our findings suggest that the solution was not intrinsically contaminated and that its anti-Acanthamoeba efficacy was likely insufficient.

40|$|Background: On 23 May 2012, a {{university}} in Jiangxi, China reported a gastroenteritis outbreak. We investigated the outbreak to identify the agent, source and mode of transmission and to recommend control measures. Methods: A case was defined as any person from the university with onset of diarrhoea (≥ 3 times/ 24 h) from 1 to 31 May 2012. Active case finding was conducted by reviewing university hospital and drug-store records and interviewing students, workers and teachers. We then conducted a case-control study in which we compared food, water and environmental exposure history. Water samples were collected and tested. Results: We identified 417 cases – an attack rate (AR) of 4. 7 % (417 / 8781) for the university. There were 416 student cases (AR = 5. 7 %) distributed across all 11 colleges, five of which were more heavily affected (AR range = 5. 9 %– 14 %). In the case-control study, cases had higher odds of having drunk bottled water (odds ratio [OR] = 4. 1; 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1. 7 – 9. 9), {{and there was a}} dose–response relationship (X 2 trend = 4. 6, P < 0. 05). Drinking boiled bottled water was inversely associated with being a case (OR = " 0. 22," 95 % CI = " 0. 07 – 0. 71). " Eating in any of the three university canteens or drinking water from the city water supply was not associated with being a case. Pathogenic Escherichia coli was isolated from two <b>unopened</b> <b>bottled</b> water specimens and from four student cases. Conclusion: This gastroenteritis outbreak was most likely caused by contaminated bottled water. The company in question has been shut down and no further cases have been reported. Increased regulation of bottled water plants and better coordination between different investigators for future outbreaks is recommended...|$|R

[...] An estimated 300 attendees set up blankets beyond the trellis system, where they could enjoy their own beverages while listening to the concert. The official Chicago policy is that alcohol is permitted throughout Jay Pritzker Pavilion during public performances, but cans and glass bottles are not permitted on the Great Lawn.

2500|$|During {{the trial}} of the conspirators the {{prosecution}} stated that each bomber would board a plane with the [...] "necessary ingredients and equipment". They would then construct the devices mid-flight and detonate them. The hydrogen peroxide [...] would be placed in 500ml plastic bottles of the Oasis and Lucozade soft drinks. A sugary drink powder, Tang, would be mixed with the hydrogen peroxide to colour it to resemble a normal soft drink. Hydrogen peroxide is widely available for use as hair bleach and along with the other ingredients can become explosive if mixed to a specific strength. The mixture would be injected into the bottles with a syringe. The bottle's cap would not have been removed and the hole would have been resealed, thereby allowing the device to resemble a normal, <b>unopened</b> drink <b>bottle</b> when screened by airport security. The use of liquid explosives with dissolved powder is similar to the composition used in the 21 July 2005 London bombings, using hydrogen peroxide and chapatti flour, activated by a detonator.|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{a number}} of cases of {{smuggling}} dissolved cocaine in wine bottles have been reported. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine whether cocaine dissolved in wine can be detected by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1) H MRS) on a standard clinical MR scanner, in intact (i. e. <b>unopened)</b> wine <b>bottles.</b> (1) H MRS experiments were performed with a 3 Tesla clinical scanner on wine phantoms with or without cocaine contamination. The aromatic protons of cocaine displayed resonance peaks in the 7 - 8 ppm region of the spectrum, where no overlapping resonances of wine were present. Additional cocaine resonances were detected in the 2 - 3 ppm region of the spectrum, between the resonances of ethanol and other wine constituents. Detection of cocaine in wine (at 5 mM, i. e. ∼ 1. 5 g/L) was feasible in a scan time of 1 min. We conclude that dissolved cocaine can be detected in intact wine bottles, on a standard clinical MR scanner. Thus, (1) H MRS is the technique of choice to examine this type of suspicious cargo, since it allows for a non-destructive and rapid content characterization.
