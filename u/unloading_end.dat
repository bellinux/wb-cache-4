The experiments {{allow for the}} evaluation of bar-to-concrete slip and splitting crack openings at several points along the anchored bar.

In specimens from the first series without transverse reinforcement, a splitting collapse of the anchorage occurred {{at the onset of the}} slip at the <b>unloaded</b> <b>end</b> of the anchored bar. The opposite was true for all the other specimens, as the transverse reinforcement percentage was such that a pull-out failure of the anchorage occurred.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a new class}} of flight control actuators using Post-Buckled Precompressed (PBP) piezoelectric elements to provide much improved actuator performance. These PBP actuator elements are modeled using basic large deflection Euler-beam estimations accounting for laminated plate effects. The deflection estimations are then coupled to a high rotation kinematic model which translates PBP beam bending to stabilator deflections. A test article using PZT- 5 H piezoceramic sheets built into an active bender element was fitted with an elastic band which induced much improved deflection levels. Statically the bender element was capable of producing <b>unloaded</b> <b>end</b> rotations on the order of ± 2. 6 °. With axial compression, the end deflections were shown to increase nearly 4 -fold. The PBP element was then fitted with a graphite-epoxy aeroshell which was designed to pitch around a tubular stainless steel main spar. Quasi-static bench testing showed excellent correlation between theory and experiment through ± 25 ° of pitch deflection. Finally, wind tunnel testing was conducted at airspeeds up to 120 kts (62 m/s, 202 ft/s). Testing showed that deflections up through ± 20 ° could be maintained at even the highest flight speed. The stabilator showed no flutter or divergence tendencies at all flight speeds. At higher deflection levels, it was shown that a slight degradation deflection was induced by nose-down pitching moments generated by separated flow conditions induced by extremely high angles of attack.

Materials and Methods: Ethical approval {{for this study was}} provided by the local ethics commission, and written informed consent was obtained. Thirty patients (mean age, 35. 4 years +/- 10. 5) with a mean postoperative follow-up period of 29. 1 months +/- 24. 4 were enrolled. A multiecho spin-echo T 2 -weighted sequence was performed at the beginning (early <b>unloading)</b> and <b>end</b> (late <b>unloading)</b> of the MR examination, with an interval of 45 minutes. Mean and zonal region of interest T 2 measurements were obtained in control cartilage and cartilage repair tissue. Statistical analysis of variance was performed. Results: The change in T 2 values of control cartilage (early unloading, 50. 2 msec +/- 8. 4; late unloading, 51. 3 msec +/- 8. 5) was less pronounced than the change in T 2 values of cartilage repair tissue (early unloading, 51. 8 msec +/- 11. 7; late unloading, 56. 1 msec +/- 14. 4) (P =. 024). The difference between control cartilage and cartilage repair tissue was not significant for early unloading (P =. 314) but was significant for late unloading (P =. 036). Zonal T 2 measurements revealed a higher dependency on unloading for the superficial cartilage layer. Conclusion: Our results suggest that T 2 relaxation can be used to assess early and late unloading values of articular cartilage in a clinical setting and that the time point of the quantitative T 2 measurement affects the differentiation between native and abnormal articular cartilage.

Mechanical properties of rocks under stresses should be carefully considered to properly interpret data from geochemical field monitoring. Two samples are uniaxially loaded up to failure, while two others are <b>unloaded</b> at the <b>end</b> of the elastic phase, {{in order to achieve}} the highest compaction of existing pores. Changes in the porosity of deformed samples are evidenced by helium pycnometer and microscopy analyses. Radon and thoron exhalation rates are measured on groups of two samples by alpha spectrometer technique. Results show that tuff samples are characterised by a dual porosity consisting of a macroporosity, given by isolated large pores with sizes from mm‐ up to cm‐scale and a microporosity ranging between microns to hundreds of microns. At the end of the elastic phase pervasive pore collapse is observed, due to the closure of the cm‐scale macropores. This is mirrored by a significant decrease of radon and thoron release. After failure, a further reduction of porosity in the rock adjacent to the fault planes is observed due to extensive closure of both macropores and micropores. At this stage radon and thoron emissions increase. The formation of new exhaling surfaces is the main carrier of the bulk increase of radon and thoron exhalations, strongly prevailing over the densification carried out from the compaction mechanisms.

30|$|Secondly, {{the tissue}} {{localization}} of Hd 3 a protein was examined using transgenic rice plants expressing Hd 3 a-GFP fusion protein {{driven by the}} Hd 3 a promoter. Hd 3 a-GFP was present in vascular tissue from the leaf blade to {{the upper part of}} the stem, the region just below the meristem where nodes are present, and in the inner cone-like region of the SAM. Hd 3 a-GFP protein is thus synthesized in the vascular tissues of leaf blades and transported through the phloem. Hd 3 a protein is then <b>unloaded</b> from the <b>end</b> of the vascular tissue and enters the SAM through cells just beneath the SAM [74]. Essentially, the same localization of Hd 3 a-GFP was observed when other vascular-specific promoters were used to express Hd 3 a-GFP, confirming that Hd 3 a-GFP is translocated from leaf and stem vasculature to the SAM. These observations indicate that Hd 3 a protein is a mobile flowering signal in rice (Fig.  1). The ability of Hd 3 a/FT protein to move long distances is also suggested from a study of the rice phloem sap proteome [4]. Rice phloem sap contains a member of Hd 3 a/FT protein family, FT-LIKE 12, along with RKIP-like proteins RICE CENTRORADIALIS 3 (RCN 3) and MOTHER OF FT 1. Hd 3 a itself was not detected, probably because photoperiod conditions and timing of sampling was not suitable for detection of Hd 3 a. Hd 3 a/FT proteins, however, have been detected in the phloem sap of other plant species. CmFTL 2, a functional ortholog of Hd 3 a/FT in Cucurbita maxima, has also been found in vascular sap and can move through graft unions to promote flowering [47]. Phloem sap obtained from the inflorescence stems of Brassica napus also contained FT protein [14]. These observations provide additional evidence that Hd 3 a/FT proteins are florigens. Evidence from Arabidopsis also supports the florigen activity of FT protein. Phloem-expressed FT-GFP and Myc-tagged FT move to the apex and cause early flowering, but FT protein with nuclear localization signal or 3 xYFP do not, probably because of immobilization [8, 29, 52].|$|R
40|$|Osteoarthritis is a slowly degenerating {{joint disease}} {{with a high}} and still {{increasing}} incidence. The disease is characterized by pain, stiffness, and functional disabilities. Cartilage damage and subchondral bone changes, accompanied by synovial inflammation are causative. Current treatment aims at controlling pain and improving function, and will inevitably lead to surgical interventions, with finally replacement of the joint by an endoprosthesis. There are many factors involved in development and progression of OA,(over) loading playing a mayor role. Overloading can be caused e. g. by obesity, malalignment with a shift of the loading axis, joint instability in case of ligament and/or muscle dysfunction, and focal overloading due to impaired mechanical properties of surrounding cartilage or bone tissue. The {{first part of this}} thesis studies the role of loading in the development of OA with a focus on bone and cartilage interaction. Studying development and treatment of OA requires the use of animal models. The recently developed canine Groove model was compared to human OA. Despite species-specific differences, OA induced changes were similar, making the model suitable for evaluation of the disease. Using this and several other canine models of OA to study early changes in OA, in collaboration with the dept. of orthopedics Erasmus MC, revealed that early in the process of OA thinning of the subchondral plate coincides with cartilage degeneration whereas impairment of subchondral trabecular bone structure is related to unloading of the joint. Thinning of the subchondral plate is suggested to be dependent on soluble mediators originating from the cartilage which is damaged due to overloading. The second part of this thesis studies unloading as a treatment of OA. After an overview of possibilities to unload a joint, there is a focus on <b>unloading</b> joint in <b>end</b> stage OA by use of joint distraction. By placement of a external fixator bridging the joint, the joint is distracted for a few millimeters, avoiding the cartilage surfaces to contact. Biomechanical conditions were created that allow cartilage and bone to repair. By use of the aforementioned canine Groove model a beneficial effect on cartilage quality could be demonstrated. In collaboration with the veterinary department of the UU these structural changes appeared to be accompanied by improved loading (less pain) of the affect joint. A study in patients with severe ankle OA in collaboration with the University of Iowa showed clinical benefits which might be explained by bone repair activity. A final study in patients with severe knee OA in collaboration with the department of orthopedics showed clinical improvement but also cartilage repair, even in severely damaged areas, by use of X-ray, MRI and biomarker analyses. Joint distraction is the first treatment of OA that is able to induce cartilage and bone regeneration in severe end stage OA, accompanied by clear prolonged clinical benefit...|$|R
40|$|Microgravity-related {{bone loss}} in astronauts is a {{well-known}} consequence of space travel. These losses {{are a result of}} the catabolic reaction of the skeleton to unloading. Anti-catabolics like bisphosphonates (BPs) have been used to combat bone loss in osteoporosis patients. Their mechanism of action also makes them a possible treatment for preventing the microgravity induced bone loss experienced by astronauts. There are a variety of BPs on the market, and many choices in treatment administration schedule. In this study, the efficacy of pre-treatment with BPs was evaluated by observing changes in bone densitometry measures, geometry, and mechanical properties over different periods. The periods of interest were the hindlimb unloading (HU) period during which microgravity is simulated and the recovery period following HU. Simulating microgravity is achieved by hindlimb unloading adult rats using the model described by Morey-Holton. Six-month old Sprague-Dawley rats were split into four groups which were ambulatory controls (AC), hindlimb unloading controls (HUC), risedronate pre-treatment (RIS), alendronate pre-treatment (ALN). During the 28 day pre-treatment period, the ALN and RIS groups were administered their respective BP pre-treatments. Following that, all groups except the ambulatory controls underwent a 28 day unloading period. Rats were reambulated and recovered for 56 days after the unloading period. Bones were harvested at baseline (day 0), end of pre-treatment (day 28), <b>end</b> of <b>unloading</b> (day 56), <b>end</b> of recovery (day 112) and analyzed. Ex vivo scans of the distal femur metaphysis (DFM) were taken using both peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) and micro computed tomography (?CT). Cross-section specimens of the DFM were isolated and compressed between two platens to estimate mechanical properties. The results of scans and tests were analyzed to determine if the pre-treatment approach prevented bone loss during HU and throughout recovery. A BP was considered protective if there were significant differences between the HUC group and AC group, but no difference between the AC group and the respective BP group. The resulting data demonstrated that both pre-treatments prevented (HU) related losses that the HUC group experienced in several densitometric and geometric parameters. HUC did not see statistically significant losses in mechanical properties; however, RIS did enhance them as compared to HUC after HU. The AC group experienced losses in cancellous bone at the end of recovery which were likely attributable to age-related decline. When AC was lowest, either both treatment groups or just RIS were significantly better. Both BP groups had enhanced intrinsic mechanical properties at the end of recovery as compared to AC. It was a reoccurring trend that RIS was significantly better than HUC while ALN would differ from neither HUC nor AC. This was true for all mechanical properties, trabecular number, and trabecular spacing after HU. After recovery, the control group (HUC or AC) with the lowest average value varied so this trend in indirect BP group differences becomes less clear. The RIS group had the lowest average densitometric and geometric results in the cortical region. Risedronate seemed to have the stronger effect on cancellous bone and total bone over the unloading period. However, the RIS group?s protection of the cortical region seemed to dissipate by the end of recovery. ALN was only slightly inferior to RIS and still protected bone during HU. Alendronate?s beneficial effects also seemed to persist better than RIS? effects did through the recovery period in both the cortical and cancellous regions. Risedronate was the more effective BP while it persisted, but this was at the cost of inferior retention in the cortical region during recovery. These results suggest that pre-treatment with either BP would be effective at combatting bone loss due to mechanical unloading. Comparisons with the results of other studies, though limited by differences in design, indicate that a pre-treatment approach is as effective in protecting bone as concurrent treatment. In some cases, it appears that the pre-treatment approach may be more effective. Their enhancement of mechanical performance makes BP pre-treatment a promising course of treatment for astronauts. Practical limitations would likely necessitate this BP pre-treatment approach to be tested in combination with aRED in a human spaceflight study. However, this pretreatment approach could first be assessed with a controlled human bedrest study...|$|R
40|$|O crescimento do setor avÃcola, tanto para atendimento ao mercado interno como para exportaÃÃo, tem movimentado o agronegÃcio brasileiro. A cadeia produtiva do frango de corte gera uma variedade e quantidade considerÃvel de resÃduos com as mais distintas caracterÃsticas. No caso dos resÃduos de incubatÃrio, tem-se um volume considerÃvel de {{material}} produzido, com grande potencial poluidor. Considerando a problemÃtica este projeto teve por objetivo o estudo da viabilidade de aproveitamento dos resÃduos de incubatÃrio por meio da co-digestÃo anaerÃbia. Para o ensaio de co-digestÃo foi utilizada uma bateria de 20 biodigestores, confeccionados com tubos de PVC, com capacidade para aproximadamente 60 L cada, simulando um biodigestor tubular horizontal. Os resÃduos foram cedidos pela Cooperativa Agroindustrial Consolata â Copacol e sÃo provenientes das unidades de CafelÃndia â PR (Abate de aves), Nova Aurora â PR (IncubatÃrio de Aves) e Formosa â PR (Unidade Produtora de LeitÃes â UPL). Cinco misturas foram avaliadas, sendo elas: Tratamento 1 : ResÃduo de incubatÃrio drenado + Ãgua do tanque de equalizaÃÃo da agroindÃstria. Tratamento 2 : ResÃduo de incubatÃrio drenado + Ãgua da primeira lagoa anaerÃbia da agroindÃstria. Tratamento 3 : ResÃduo de incubatÃrio fresco + Ãgua da primeira lagoa anaerÃbia do incubatÃrio. Tratamento 4 : ResÃduo de incubatÃrio fresco + Ãgua residuÃria da suinocultura. Tratamento 5 (Misto) : ResÃduos de incubatÃrio fresco + Ãgua da primeira lagoa anaerÃbia do incubatÃrio + Ãgua residuÃria da suinocultura. Cada mistura compÃs um tratamento, o qual foi repetido quatro vezes. Todas as misturas foram processadas em liquidificador. As diferentes misturas foram calculadas de maneira a obter um substrato com 4 % de sÃlidos totais no inÃcio do processo - fase batelada, e com 2 % de sÃlidos totais para fase contÃnua. AlÃm dos materiais avaliados, todos os tratamentos receberam uma porcentagem de 15 % de inÃculo (resÃduo de gado de corte) na fase batelada e fase de adaptaÃÃo do sistema na alimentaÃÃo contÃnua. Primeiramente foi realizado o ensaio em batelada, o que possibilitou definir o ponto de queima do biogÃs nos diferentes tratamentos, bem como a curva de produÃÃo de gÃs, definindo assim, o tempo de retenÃÃo hidrÃulica (TRH) do substrato nos biodigestores. Para a fase contÃnua os biodigestores foram descarregados no final da fase batelada onde o efluente foi peneirado. ApÃs a fraÃÃo lÃquida foi novamente disposta nos biodigestores. A partir desta fase iniciouse o abastecimento continuo onde durante um mÃs os biodigestores alÃm de sua carga diÃria tambÃm receberam uma porcentagem de inÃculo para que houvesse uma adaptaÃÃo do sistema. As anÃlises de caracterizaÃÃo foram realizadas no afluente e efluente dos biodigestores na fase batelada, nos resÃduos separadamente, no afluente e efluente da fase contÃnua como tambÃm no resÃduo retido no biodigestor apÃs fase de abastecimento contÃnuo. Foram utilizadas metodologias especÃficas para as anÃlises, tais como: ST, SV, carbono orgÃnico total, nitrogÃnio (NTK), minerais, pH, condutividade elÃtrica, DQO, bem como o potencial mÃdio de produÃÃo de biogÃs e metano, porcentagem de metano e diÃxido de carbono no mesmo. T 4 apresentou os melhores desempenhos em produÃÃo de biogÃs. Maiores porcentagens de CH 4 na fase batelada foram apresentadas pelo tratamento T 2. Para fase contÃnua as maiores porcentagens foram apresentadas pelos tratamentos T 2, T 4 e T 5. A maior reduÃÃo nos valores de DQO foi observada no tratamento contendo Ãgua residuÃria da lagoa anaerÃbia do frigorifico - T 2. A concentraÃÃo de minerais no efluente dos biodigestores, para todos os tratamentos, agregou ao biofertilizante valor agronÃmico. The {{growth of}} the poultry sector, both to supply the internal market and for export, has moved the Brazilian agribusiness. The productive chain of the broiler generates a considerable variety and quantity of waste with the most distinct characteristics. In the case of hatchery waste, has been a considerable volume of material produced, with high pollution potential. Considering the problems this project aimed to study the feasibility of use of hatchery waste by anaerobic co-digestion. To test the co-digestion was used a battery of 20 digesters made with PVC pipes, with a capacity of about 60 L each, simulating a horizontal tubular digester. The wastes were disposed of by Cooperativa Agroindustrial Consolata - Copacol and are from the units of CafelÃndia - PR (Slaughter of poultry), Nova Aurora - PR (Poultry Hatchery) and Formosa - PR (Unit Production of Piglets - UPL). Five mixtures were evaluated, as follows: Treatment 1 : Residue hatchery drained + Waste water tank agribusiness. Treatment 2 : Residue hatchery drained + water from the first anaerobic pond agribusiness. Treatment 3 : Residue hatchery fresh + water the first anaerobic pond of the hatchery. Treatment 4 : Residue hatchery fresh + swine wastewater. Treatment 5 (Mixed) : Residue hatchery fresh + water the first anaerobic pond of the hatchery + swine wastewater. Each composed a mixture treatment, which was repeated four times. All blends were processed in the blender. The different mixtures were calculated to obtain a substrate with 4 % total solids early in the process - batch phase, and 2 % total solids for solid phase. Besides the materials evaluated, all treatments received a percentage of 15 % of inoculum (cattle waste) during batch and adaptation phase of the system in continuous feeding. First test was performed in batch, {{making it possible to}} define the point of burning the biogas in the different treatments, and the curve of gas production, thus setting the hydraulic retention time (TRH) substrate in the digesters. For the continuous phase digesters were <b>unloaded</b> at the <b>end</b> of the batch phase where the effluent was screened. After, the liquid fraction was again prepared in the digesters. From this phase, began one where supplies still over a month the digesters beyond their daily load also received a percentage of inoculum for there was an adaptation of the system. Analyses were performed to characterize the influent and effluent of the digesters in the batch phase, the waste separately, in the influent and effluent of the continuous phase as well in residue retained in the digester after stage continuous water supply. Specific methodologies were used for analysis, such as: ST, SV, total organic carbon, nitrogen (TKN), minerals, pH, conductivity, COD, and the average potential of biogas production and methane content of methane and carbon dioxide carbon in it. T 4 showed the best performance in biogas production. Higher percentages of CH 4 in the batch phase were presented by the T 2. For the continuous phase, the highest percentages were presented by the T 2, T 4 and T 5. The largest reduction in COD values was observed in plants containing wastewater from the anaerobic pond the fridge - T 2. The concentration of minerals in the effluent of the digesters, all treatments, added to biofertilizer agronomic value...|$|R
