30|$|This paper {{presents}} a new aquathermolysis study of conventional heavy oil in superheated steam. A new high temperature autoclave was designed, where volume and pressure could be adjusted. Aquathermolysis was studied {{on two different}} conventional heavy oil samples <b>under</b> <b>different</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> and temperatures. Experimental results show that aquathermolysis does take place for conventional heavy oil. As reaction time increases, the oil viscosity reduces. However, the reaction will reach equilibrium after {{a certain period of}} time and won’t be sensitive to any further reaction time any more. Analysis shows that, while resin and asphaltenes decrease, saturated hydrocarbons and the H/C ratio increase after reaction. The main mechanism of aquathermolysis includes hydrogenization, desulfuration reaction of resin and asphaltenes, etc.|$|E

The system revealed, for the first time, instantaneous (within 1 min) conversions of Ca(OH) (2) (95. 1 - 100. 0 %) with the volume ratios of ethanol between 10 % and 80 %, indicating that both the water content {{and the expansion of}} the system take effect in the carbonation process. The instantaneous carbonation with 80 % ethanol ratio led to production of 12. 8 % aragonite polymorph. Further examination of this carbonation case <b>under</b> <b>different</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> found that, interestingly and importantly, pure calcite phase was stabilized within a short time (210 min) as compared to those reported in the literature; however, in this period, the system exhibited chameleonic phase transformation between calcite, aragonite, and vaterite, normal to abnormal and vice versa...|$|E
30|$|The {{functional}} properties of nanoparticles are {{heavily dependent on}} their shapes, sizes, and size distribution. Various methods {{have been used to}} prepare carbon spheres, such as chemical vapor deposition [21], templating method [22], pyrolysis of carbon sources [23], and hydrothermal method. Among them, the hydrothermal method is widely used due to its advantages, such as high purity, controllable shape and size, and inexpensive operation [24]. Moreover, the CCS produced by the hydrothermal approach have a hydrophilic surface covered with C–OH groups, which are available for further surface functional modification, as well as the CCS can be easily removed by oxidation at high temperature or by dissolving via enzyme in solution. Therefore, many studies focused on the synthesis of carbon colloids via the hydrothermal approach. For example, Wang et al. [1] were the first to report the hydrothermal synthesis of hard carbon spheres by using sugar as a precursor through heat treatment at 190 °C for 5 h. Li et al. [22] reported that the carbon spheres could be prepared with different sizes from 200 to 1, 500 nm <b>under</b> <b>different</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> (2 – 10 h, at 160 °C). Later, Mi et al. [25] demonstrated a high-temperature method to produce carbon microspheres with size of 1 – 2 μm by heating at 500 °C for 12 h in a sealed autoclave. Despite some successes, limitations still exist in generating monodispersed CCS. This is because it is difficult to control or adjust the concentration of the precursor in a sealed system, which will affect the nucleation and growth, and hence the morphology and size of CCS. Therefore, to develop a simple and efficient method to prepare monodispersed CCS is still challenging.|$|E

40|$|Here {{we report}} {{the use of}} a {{one-step}} process of reactive melt mixing to prepare starch-based superabsorbent polymers (SBSAPs) for the slow release of urea as a fertilizer. A modified twin-rotor mixer, with improved sealing to establish an oxygen-free environment, was used to study the chemical and physical reactions during the melt-processing through monitoring the temperature and torque. The effects of the initiator (ceric ammonium nitrate, or CAN), crosslinker (N,N′-methylene-bisacrylamide, or N,N′-MBA) and saponification agent (NaOH) <b>under</b> <b>different</b> <b>reaction</b> conditions (<b>time,</b> temperature, and shear intensity) were systematically studied. Also investigated was the effect of starch with different amylose content. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) confirmed that using this simple technique, SBSAPs were successfully prepared from either high-amylopectin starch (waxy corn starch) or high-amylose starch (Gelose 50) grafted with AM and crosslinked by N,N′-MBA. Gel strength was evaluated by rheometry, which revealed a significant increase in storage modulus (G′) obtained in the crosslinked high-amylose SBSAP gels. Also, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed a more sophisticated structural network with a smaller pore size in the crosslinked high-amylose gels. Urea as a fertilizer was embedded in the SBSAP gel network, and this network controlled the urea release in water. The release rate of urea depended on the gel strength, gel microstructure and water absorption capacity (WAC) of SAP, which was affected by the reaction conditions and degree of saponification...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} has established that dopamine signals are crucial in orienting behavior to reward. Less is known, however, about the psychopharmacology of task performance under small-reward conditions {{as compared to}} large-reward conditions. The current study {{examined the effects of}} the noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) -receptor antagonist dizocilpine (MK- 801) on <b>reaction</b> <b>time</b> (RT) in a nose-poke task with rats completing an asymmetric reward schedule. In all trials, the rats were required to poke their nose in either the left or the right peripheral hole immediately adjacent to the centre hole when the corresponding light was illuminated. Depending on the stimulus-reward mapping, however, one position was associated with a large reward, while the alternative position was associated with a small reward. Correct performance was required in every trial; if the rat did not make a correct response within 20 s, the trial was aborted, and the same stimulus was presented again on the next trial. In this way, the rat was forced to perform the same visuo-spatial discrimination task <b>under</b> <b>different</b> reward conditions. <b>Reaction</b> <b>times</b> (ms) were faster for large-reward trials than for small-reward trials, replicating previous findings. At a dosage of MK- 801 (0. 04 mg/kg), there was no significant influence of on RT in large-reward trials. In contrast, the same dosage of MK- 801 in small-reward trials produced a decrease in RT as compared to the control condition, implying an improvement of performance. Below 0. 04 mg/kg of MK- 801, a steady decrease of RT in small-trials was seen as a function of dosage. Above 0. 04 mg/kg of MK- 801, the majority of rats failed to perform the task at all, whereas the rats that did manage to perform the criterion of 80 correct trials in a session showed no difference in RT between large- and small-reward trials. These data indicate that the systemic administration of a relatively small dosage of MK- 801 facilitates performance when reward is small. It is suggested that the facilitation {{may be due to the}} reinforcement of mechanisms that work in opposition to response bias. As a corollary, the study provides a useful paradigm to study the voluntary control of unavoidable action...|$|R

40|$|Molecular {{imprinting}} is {{a powerful}} synthetic technique for generating template-defined binding sites in cross-linked polymers. One scientific challenge in molecular imprinting research is to understand the intermolecular interactions leading to molecular complexation {{and the process of}} binding site formation during polymerization. In this work, we present a novel method for studying the molecular imprinting process in precipitation polymerization systems. This method employs solution (1) H NMR and dynamic light scattering (DLS) to investigate the association of template molecules with colloidal particles and the dynamic process of particle growth. Under precipitation polymerization conditions, the colloidal particles formed did not interfere with NMR signals from the soluble components, allowing unreacted monomers and free template to be easily quantified. To examine the process of particle nucleation and growth, DLS was used to measure the hydrodynamic particle size at <b>different</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>times.</b> To corroborate the interpretation of the NMR and DLS results, imprinted nanoparticles were collected at <b>different</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> and their binding characteristics were evaluated using radioligand-binding analysis.
