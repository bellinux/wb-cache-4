25|$|On 25 September 1883, {{a test of}} a {{cable car}} system was held by Liverpool United Tramways and Omnibus Company in Kirkdale, Liverpool. This {{would have been the}} first cable car system in Europe, but the company decided against {{implementing}} it. Instead, the distinction went to the 1884 route from Archway to Highgate, north London, which used a continuous cable and grip system on the 1 in 11 (9%) climb of Highgate Hill. The installation was not reliable and was replaced by electric traction in 1909. Other cable car systems were implemented in Europe, though, among which was the Glasgow District Subway, the first <b>underground</b> <b>cable</b> car system, in 1896. (London, England's first deep-level tube railway, the City & South London Railway, had earlier also been built for cable haulage but had been converted to electric traction before opening in 1890.) A few more cable car systems were built in the United Kingdom, Portugal, and France. European cities, having many more curves in their streets, were ultimately less suitable for cable cars than American cities.|$|E

500|$|Four work-ins {{were held}} during 1984. The first two were by {{apprentices}} from Eastern Electricity Board. Thelnetham Windmill was chosen at {{the project to}} benefit from the Young Person's Development Project for that year. Pakenham Watermill had previously benefited from the project, and its owners, the Suffolk Preservation Trust, had suggested that Thelnetham Windmill would be a good candidate for the scheme. Two separate parties spent a week each at the mill. A mains electricity supply was provided. An <b>underground</b> <b>cable</b> was laid with assistance from British Telecom who were trialling a thrust borer which had been developed at their research facility at Martlesham Heath.

2500|$|A {{number of}} {{experiments}} were tried {{out over the}} next few decades in an attempt to find a better method than horses or mules for propulsion of streetcars. [...] These included an overhead cable car system (an <b>underground</b> <b>cable,</b> such as was eventually developed in San Francisco, was impossible because of the high water table under New Orleans); a walking beam system; peneumatic propulsion; an ammonia locomotive; a [...] "Thermo-specific" [...] system using super-heated water; and the Lamm Fireless engine. [...] Lamm engines were actually adopted and used for a time on the New Orleans and Carrollton line, which had previously used steam locomotives. [...] That line gradually gave up steam locomotives because of the objections of residents along the line to the smoke, soot, and noise. The area between the town of Carrollton and the City of New Orleans was sparsely populated with large swaths of agricultural land when the line was laid out in the 1830s; by the latter 19th century it was almost completely urbanized. [...] Carrollton was annexed to New Orleans in 1874. [...] Due to this increased urbanization, horsecars were used on the entire line.|$|E
2500|$|Ideally, the {{underground}} {{part of the}} assembly should reside {{in an area of}} high ground conductivity. If the <b>underground</b> <b>cable</b> is able to resist corrosion well, it can be covered in salt to improve its electrical connection with the ground. While the electrical resistance of the lightning conductor between the air terminal and the Earth is of significant concern, the inductive reactance of the conductor could be more important. For this reason, the down conductor route is kept short, and any curves have a large radius. If these measures are not taken, lightning current may arc over a resistive or reactive obstruction that it encounters in the conductor. At the very least, the arc current will damage the lightning conductor and can easily find another conductive path, such as building wiring or plumbing, and cause fires or other disasters. Grounding systems without low resistivity to the ground can still be effective in protecting a structure from lightning damage. When ground soil has poor conductivity, is very shallow, or non-existent, a grounding system can be augmented by adding ground rods, counterpoise (ground ring) conductor, cable radials projecting away from the building, or a concrete building's reinforcing bars can be used for a ground conductor (Ufer ground). These additions, while still not reducing the resistance of the system in some instances, will allow the [...] of the lightning into the earth without damage to the structure.|$|E

This paper investigates this thesis reporting results of a Contingent Valuation study conducted in late 2012 in four regions of Germany, which are affected by transmission line development in different ways. In an analysis of 1. 003 household responses a majority of households favours <b>underground</b> <b>cables</b> (about 60 %). Willingness-to-pay, however, relativizes this result. Almost 50 % of households voting for <b>underground</b> <b>cables</b> are not willing to accept an increase in electricity prices to finance cable projects (free riders). The fact that positive willingness-to-pay does not correlate positively with increasing lengths of <b>underground</b> <b>cables</b> in 60 % of cases underlines that cables are not supported unconditionally. All-in-all, the thesis that cables increase acceptance of grid development has to be rejected based on the WTP-evaluation presented in this paper...|$|R
