40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relation}} between managers' wealth concerns {{and the degree of}} conservatism in reported earnings. The nature of accounting causes reported earnings to be inherently untimely. The timeliness is less prominent for gains than for losses, which result is in conservatively reported earnings numbers. Earnings conservatism serves an important purpose, it reduces the likelihood of conflict about the ex-post distribution of a firm's cash flows among parties associating with a firm. Conservatism enables outside parties to learn efficiently about the quality of a firm's manager, which is beneficial for him. <b>Unlike</b> <b>existing</b> <b>research,</b> this paper assumes that managers value the benefits of conflict reduction differently. This paper hypothesizes that a manager's wealth concerns determine the degree of conservatism. The empirical results confirm this hypothesis.

Moreover, it is proven that if the form F is indefinite on T_n and the sequence of the successive L-substitution sets is convergent, then the sequence of sets {SLS^(m) (F) } is negatively terminating, and an algorithm for deciding indefinite forms with a counter-example is obtained. Thus, various effective substitutions for deciding positive semi-definite forms and indefinite forms are gained, which are beyond the weighted difference substitutions characterized by "difference".

40|$|Abstract. The {{expansion}} in mobile phone coverage has changed {{rural and urban}} populations ’ access to information within much of the developing world. In sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, mobile phone technology has reduced communication costs, thereby reducing search costs. Existing evidence suggests that information technology has decreased price dispersion across markets for either highly perishable commodities or for consumer prices. We use micro-level data to estimate the impact of mobile phone coverage on farmers ’ welfare. We merge panel data on producer prices, transport costs and rainfall with detailed data on mobile phone coverage location and dates. Using market pair fixed effects, we find that introducing mobile phone coverage reduces producer price dispersion for cowpeas by 6 percent. This result is robust {{to the use of}} alternative measures of the dependent variable. The effect is stronger for markets that are farther apart and for those linked by unpaved roads, but there is no strong seasonal effect. <b>Unlike</b> <b>existing</b> <b>research</b> on the impact of information technology, these effects do not translate into higher producer prices for farmers but do translate into lower intra-annual price risk. Supplementary farmer and trader-level data suggests that the limited welfareenhancing effects for farmers are driven by relatively limited mobile phone coverage in remote rural areas during the period of analysis.

40|$|DUE TO COPYRIGHT RESTRICTIONS ONLY AVAILABLE FOR CONSULTATION AT ASTON UNIVERSITY LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES WITH PRIOR ARRANGEMENT One of {{the current}} {{research}} trends in Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) involves examining the critical factors for its successful implementation. However, such research is limited to system implementation, not focusing on the flexibility of ERP to respond to changes in business. Therefore, this study explores a combination system, made up of an ERP and informality, intended to provide organisations with efficient and flexible performance simultaneously. In addition, this research analyses the benefits and challenges of using the system. The research was based on socio-technical system (STS) theory which contains two dimensions: 1) a technical dimension which evaluates {{the performance of the}} system; and 2) a social dimension which examines the impact of the system on an organisation. A mixed method approach has been followed in this research. The qualitative part aims to understand the constraints of using a single ERP system, and to define a new system corresponding to these problems. To achieve this goal, four Chinese companies operating in different industries were studied, all of which faced challenges in using an ERP system due to complexity and uncertainty in their business environments. The quantitative part contains a discrete-event simulation study that is intended to examine the impact of operational performance when a company implements the hybrid system in a real-life situation. Moreover, this research conducts a further qualitative case study, the better to understand the influence of the system in an organisation. The empirical aspect of the study reveals that an ERP with pre-determined business activities cannot react promptly to unanticipated changes in a business. Incorporating informality into an ERP can react to different situations by using different procedures that are based on the practical knowledge of frontline employees. Furthermore, the simulation study shows that the combination system can achieve a balance between efficiency and flexibility. <b>Unlike</b> <b>existing</b> <b>research,</b> which emphasises a continuous improvement in the IT functions of an enterprise system, this research contributes to providing a definition of a new system in theory, which has mixed performance and contains both the formal practices embedded in an ERP and informal activities based on human knowledge. It supports both cost-efficiency in executing business transactions and flexibility in coping with business uncertainty. This research also indicates risks of using the system, such as using an ERP with limited functions; a high cost for performing informally; and a low system acceptance, owing to a shift in organisational culture. With respect to practical contribution, this research suggests that companies can choose the most suitable enterprise system approach in accordance with their operational strategies. The combination system can be implemented in a company that needs to operate a medium amount of volume and variety. By contrast, the traditional ERP system is better suited in a company that operates a high-level volume market, while an informal system is more suitable for a firm with a requirement for a high level of variety...|$|E

The continuous monitoring spans the period from 1950 to 2016 (and onward) providing annual information on advertised jobs specified by location and occupation. Job advertisements allow for the adequate measurement of the personnel needs of employers in terms of specific occupational skills because job advertisements usually contain detailed information on job characteristics and the requirements that applicants must meet (Kriesi et al. 2010). Furthermore, the number of job advertisements approximately corresponds to excess demand because the more difficulties employers encounter in finding an appropriate employee, the more advertisements they publish for a vacant job. Therefore, the likelihood of a job being included in the dataset increases when a particular skill demand exceeds supply.

However, if there exist nonlinearities in the measurements, is it still possible to recover sparse or structured signals from the nonlinear measurements? The research of nonlinear CS is devoted to answering this question. In this paper, <b>unlike</b> the <b>existing</b> <b>research</b> angles of nonlinear CS, we study it {{from the perspective of}} mapping decomposition, and propose a new concept, namely, nonlinear CS based on composite mappings. Through the analysis of two forms of a nonlinear composite mapping Phi, i. e., Phi(x) = F(Ax) and Phi(x) = AF(x), we give the requirements respectively for the sensing matrix A and the nonlinear mapping F when reconstructing all sparse signals exactly from the nonlinear measurements Phi(x). Besides, we also provide a special pointwise linearization method, which can turn the nonlinear composite mapping Phi, at each point in its domain, into an equivalent linear composite mapping. This linearization method can guarantee the exact recovery of all given sparse signals even if Phi is not an injection for all sparse signals. It may help us build an algorithm framework for the composite nonlinear CS in which we can take full advantage of the existing recovery algorithms belonging to linear CS. Comment: 16 page...|$|R

The out-of-sample forecasting between July 1995 and June 1997 shows that prior to breakout of the crisis, several indicators including real exchange rates and exports sent frequent warnings to all crisis-hit East Asian countries except the Philippines. This may indicate that a signaling-based early warning system for currency crisis could have been an useful method of forecasting the East Asian crisis. On the other hand, we also find that our forecasting system often generates warning signals during the out-of-sample period between July 1999 and June 2001. Since we have not observed any currency crisis in this region after 1998, these are all false alarms, indicating that our system may be seriously exposed to the type II error.

We also attempt to see if these investors coordinate among themselves to constrain insiders from expropriating corporate resources. We find a significant curvilinear relationship between firm value and the fraction of voting rights owned by insiders. The curve slopes downward until insider ownership reaches approximately between 45 percent and 63 percent, then slopes upward. Empirical results on ownership concentration by minority blockholders do not support the monitoring hypothesis of these investors. Furthermore, the coordinated behavior of the largest two minority blockholders has an increasing (decreasing) impact on firm value when the collective control is located in the lower (higher) range.

Based on the prediction, the cars choose a safe speed and trajectory for themselves. Therefore, the current research on intelligent cars is mainly focused on collision avoidance because of safety. Every year, there are over two million traffic-related deaths worldwide. This number could be dramatically reduced, especially since 94 % of accidents in the U. S. involve human error. In this work, we show the design, development, and testing of an autonomous ground vehicle for testing energy-efficient of Q-learning in robotics. The vehicle platform is based on the Boe-Bot chassis, which is an education shield for Arduino. The Boe-Bot is a common research testbed that encourages the use of low-cost hardware and open-source software. The research platform uses Raspberry pi 2 Model B as its on-board computer for handling Q-Table collision avoidance like processing sensor data and computing deciding actions. The robot is then tested by using a modified Q-Learning algorithm to avoid collisions. We design hardware-friendly software, and the robot can use the same Q-Table as the software.

In order to understand these concepts, the innerworkings of the North American automotive industry will be discussed as examples toexaminethe relationship between interpersonal trust (affective and cognitive) and organizational culture. We provide this atypical conceptual discussion using Social Exchange theory, with a focus on organizational directed social exchanges. While trust is considered a closely associated variable to Social Exchange theory, very rarely is it discussed in terms of cognitive and affective trust {{as is the case in}} this paper, nor is it discussed in terms of its possible net effect on the culture {{of an organization}}. This article takes a broad and conceptual look at <b>existing</b> <b>research</b> and attempts to make some propositions for filling the gaps on how trust could help build organizational culture using a process-based approach <b>unlike</b> <b>existing</b> models that use a content-based approach. Finally,fourkey lessonsare drawn and shared from our analysis...|$|R
