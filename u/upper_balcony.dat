5|$|As the Britannia Restaurant {{takes up}} the full width of the ship on two decks, a 'tween deck, called Deck 3L, was devised to allow {{passengers}} to walk from the Grand Lobby to the Queen's Room without traversing the dining room mid-meal. The deck consists of two corridors that run beneath the <b>upper</b> <b>balcony</b> of the restaurant on Deck 3, and above the main dining area on Deck 2. This is why the balcony of the Britannia has tiers that step up towards the hull. This arrangement is illustrated on the hull {{where there is a}} stack of three rows of windows in the area where the main restaurant sits, the two upper and lower most rows illuminate the dining room, while the centre row serves Deck 3L. There is a similar arrangement through the Royal Court Theatre. As well, the passages that run on either side of Illuminations on Deck 3 ramp upwards to compensate for the change in deck elevation between the entrance to Illuminations and an elevator bank forward of the room.|$|E
5|$|While {{the guests}} search for clues in {{discovering}} the killer's identity, they realise {{that many of}} them had motives for wanting revenge on James Woods. Tom did not take the part of Freddy Krueger in A Nightmare on Elm Street due to James advising him not to, Brian had the pilot of his series messed up by James, and Quagmire lost Cheryl Tiegs due to him, while Consuela the Mexican maid says he molested her nephew, causing him to 'shoot himself in the face'. After reading a notebook belonging to Woods and found in a secret room, Mort Goldman's wife, Muriel, disappears after it is discovered that she was being blackmailed by Woods, causing everyone to suspect her as the culprit. Peter accidentally got Joe knocked out, so organizes the groups, however several of them are separated from each other due to the secret passages. However, Muriel turns up dead soon after by being stabbed in the back with the same knife that killed James, placing suspicion on Priscilla, who also disappeared during the commotion. Jillian's husband, Derek goes to an <b>upper</b> <b>balcony</b> to find a cell phone signal and contact the police, but is soon murdered by the unseen killer with one of Woods's Golden Globe Awards. The guests search everyone's rooms until they locate the bloodstained award and Priscilla's dead body in Tom Tucker's guest room. Tom is thus implicated as the killer and is chased and caught by Peter, Joe, Carl, Dr. Hartman, Quagmire, Seamus, and Mayor Adam West.|$|E
25|$|A new {{multi-storey}} brick theatre {{was erected}} around 1810 {{on what was}} at the time the north side of H Street (now Broad). There was an orchestra section, a first balcony, and an <b>upper</b> <b>balcony,</b> with narrow doorways.|$|E

40|$|In case of fire in an atrium, smoke {{produced}} {{is recognized}} as one of the major hazards for the occupants because of open spaces present in an atrium. The effect of varying the down stand depth at fire compartment on smoke contamination in <b>upper</b> <b>balconies</b> of an atrium has been investigated in this paper. Correlation to predict the smoke contamination in <b>upper</b> <b>balconies</b> of an atrium in the presence of 0. 5 m deep down stand structure has also been developed. This correlation is compared with correlations developed for 1 m deep down stand and without down stand structure by past research. The comparison results showed that when the depth of down stand structure increase, smoke contamination in <b>upper</b> <b>balconies</b> of an atrium also increases. The results also showed that smoke contamination in <b>upper</b> <b>balconies</b> of an atrium decreases when the ratio of w/d increases. The comparison of correlations from 1 m and 0. 5 m deep down stand showed that the difference in smoke contamination increases when w/d < 3. By comparing the correlations from 0. 5 m deep down stand and no down stand, there is very small difference in smoke contamination from both case but it is applicable for w/d < 3...|$|R
40|$|Channel screens {{are used}} to {{restrict}} the smoke from spreading laterally under the first balcony. Effect of channel screens on smoke contamination in atrium <b>upper</b> <b>balconies</b> {{with the presence of}} balcony open upstand and 1 m deep down stand at the fire compartment is investigated in this paper. Fire dynamic simulator (FDS 6) which is a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) software was utilized to conduct the simulation. A comparison between the results of smoke contamination with the presence and omission of channeling screens showed that the height of smoke contamination in atrium <b>upper</b> <b>balconies</b> increased by 90 % in case of no channel screens at the fire compartment are installed. A new correlation obtained from this work is able to predict the height of smoke contamination in atrium <b>upper</b> <b>balconies</b> with the presence of 1 m deep down stand, balcony open upstand and no channel screens...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Whether {{the balcony}} spill plume will rise {{unhindered}} {{as a free}} plume or curl inward and interact with the atrium structure is dependent upon a number of factors. Not all the factors are well investigated and wholly understood, resulting in limited guidance for fire engineers. This article systematically investigates the effects of varying balcony breadths, plume widths, and fire sizes on smoke contamination in <b>upper</b> <b>balconies</b> {{through a series of}} smoke flow experiments conducted using a one-tenth physical scale model representing a six-story atrium building. The scale model simulated a fire in an adjacent compartment connecting to a fully open atrium. Visual observations and temperature measurements of the smoke flows were carried out. From the results, it was established that the extent of smoke contamination in <b>upper</b> <b>balconies</b> increased with decreasing balcony breadths, increasing plume widths, and decreasing fire sizes. Analysis showed that the aspect ratio of plume width to balcony breadth can be used to determine whether smoke contamina-tion of <b>upper</b> <b>balconies</b> will occur. Where contamination is likely, an empirical correlation was developed to determine the minimum height of contamination above the lowest balcony of smoke contamination. *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed...|$|R

500|$|The Alhambra Theatre {{was built}} in 1854 {{on the east side}} of the square, {{dominating}} the site. It temporarily closed two years later when the original owner, Edward Clarke, became bankrupt, but then reopened in 1858 as the Alhambra Palace. It enjoyed a surge in popularity after Queen Victoria and family came to see [...] "Black Eagle – The Horse of Beauty". It burned down in 1882, but reopened the following year. In the early 20th century, the theatre became a popular venue for ballet. It was demolished in 1936 and replaced by the Odeon Cinema. The Empire Theatre of Varieties opened in 1881 on the former site of Savile House, but had a troubled start, closing for a time, until the end of the decade. The theatre had a notorious reputation for high-class prostitutes frequenting the theatre, and in 1894 the London County Council ordered the promenade on the <b>upper</b> <b>balcony</b> to be remodelled. A young Winston Churchill, then a cadet at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, helped destroy canvas screens that had been erected to prevent access to the balcony. The theatre closed in 1927, to be replaced by the Empire Cinema.|$|E
2500|$|In the <b>upper</b> <b>balcony</b> at {{the west}} {{front of the church}} is a rare pipe organ made by the Casavant Frères Company of Canada and {{installed}} in 1953. With approximately 1,700 pipes, it is the third organ that has been used in the church. For its dedication on December 8, 1953, the Sisters of Providence held a brief organ recital featuring Sister of Providence organist and composer Sister Cecilia Clare Bocard, who played her musical composition, [...] "Te Deum Laudamus". The organ was renovated in 1999.|$|E
2500|$|On March 8, 1909, the theater's {{opening night}} {{production}} of George Cohan's Little Johnny Jones was viewed by a sold-out audience. [...] Traditional theater {{played a major}} role in the Bijou's early success, with performances that included Mr. Green's Reception, which starred the Marx Brothers. [...] Between 1914 and 1921, B. F. Keith's company managed the Bijou, and vaudeville became the theater's primary attraction. [...] While African-Americans were only allowed in the theater's gallery (now the <b>upper</b> <b>balcony)</b> on main performance nights, Knoxville Colored High School used the theater for commencement ceremonies in the 1910s, and Knoxville College performed plays at the theater.|$|E
50|$|Prominent {{examples}} are the double chapels at imperial castles and Kaiserpfalzen, {{for example the}} chapel of Nuremberg Castle.

50|$|The first {{classes were}} held in 1950 in the garage/stable building. While many more modern {{buildings}} have been developed on the campus, the mansion, stables, and other outbuildings are still used for educational, administrative, and custodial purposes. The college has made a few changes: converting one of the <b>upper</b> <b>balconies</b> to an office, enclosing the porches, and putting in new vestibule doors. Other than that, the buildings have retained their integrity.|$|R
2500|$|The theatre had {{multiple}} exits: a little known side-door {{was used by}} those in the orchestra and back stage while an <b>upper</b> <b>balcony</b> exit was a clear way out. In the panic of the fire, many people were pushed and fell, and {{they were unable to}} escape. Many people jumped out of the windows of the theatre. Others who were assembled near the window were afraid to do so. The editor of the Richmond Standard, present at the scene, urged people to jump; he, with help from many others on the ground, then heroically saved the lives of many of those who chose to do so.|$|E
2500|$|The next {{theater was}} the Théâtre des Funambules. [...] It was ancient, long, dark and cramped. [...] It {{had been made}} famous in 1828 from portrayals of the sad clown Pierrot by the mime Jean-Gaspard Deburau, whose story is told in the 1945 film The Children of Paradise (Les Infants de Paradis). [...] Next to the Funambules was the Théâtre des Délassements-Comiques, famous for {{vaudeville}} and pantomime, and dancing by beautiful women in costumes as scant as the censors would allow. [...] They performed the Rigolboche, later known as the French can-can. The last theater in the group was Petit Lazary, the least expensive theater in Paris. [...] It offered two shows a day, each of four vaudeville acts, as well as pantomime. [...] For 15 centimes, a spectator could {{have a place in}} the Paradis, the <b>upper</b> <b>balcony.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Enrico Caruso {{once said}} that all it takes for {{successful}} performance of Il trovatore is the four greatest singers in the world. On many different occasions, this opera and its music have been featured in various forms of popular culture and entertainment. Scenes of comic chaos play out over a performance of Il trovatore in the Marx Brothers's film, A Night at the Opera (including a quotation, {{in the middle of}} the Act I Overture, of Take Me Out to the Ball Game). Luchino Visconti used a performance of Il trovatore at La Fenice opera house for the opening sequence of his 1954 film Senso. As Manrico sings his battle cry in [...] "Di quella pira", the performance is interrupted by the answering cries of Italian nationalists in the <b>upper</b> <b>balcony</b> who shower the stalls area below with patriotic leaflets. In Italian Film in the Light of Neorealism, Millicent Marcus proposes that Visconti used this operatic paradigm throughout Senso, with parallels between the opera's protagonists, Manrico and Leonora, and the film's protagonists, Ussoni and Livia. A staging of Act 1, Scene 2 of Il trovatore is featured in Bernardo Bertolucci's 1979 film La Luna.|$|E

5000|$|The gods (UK English), or {{sometimes}} paradise, is a theatrical term, {{referring to the}} highest areas of a theatre such as the <b>upper</b> <b>balconies.</b> These are generally the cheapest seats. One reason for naming the cheapest seats [...] "the gods" [...] is because the theatres have beautifully painted ceilings, often mythological themes, so the cheap seats are up near the gods. Another is that those seated in [...] "the gods" [...] look down upon both {{the players and the}} occupants of more expensive seats, like the Olympian Gods looking down from Mount Olympus upon the lives of mortal men and women.|$|R
