40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{we deal with}} the problem <b>of</b> driving <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> alcohol; which {{is due to the fact}} that alcohol is present in every third traffic accident. We studied <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> alcohol on a person and his or her driving capabilities, how often people drive <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> alcohol, and how often it comes up as a {{secondary}} reason for traffic accidents. We also investigated how drivers <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> alcohol are treated, and how occurrences of such driving could be prevented. At the end, we described some projects and organizations that deal with the prevention of this problem. In the empiric part, we used a quantitative approach to check the most common reasons for driving <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> alcohol. We were also interested in the differences between men and women, and younger and older drivers regarding their opinions on driving <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> alcohol. We were also looking for a connection between experiences <b>of</b> driving <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> alcohol and opinions regarding rising or lowering of allowed concentration of alcohol in the blood. The results show that women rarely drive <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> alcohol, and are more strongly against driving <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> than men. We managed to prove a connection between experiences <b>of</b> driving <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> alcohol and opinions regarding the altering of allowed concentration of alcohol in the blood. There were no significant differences in our sample between younger and older drivers regarding opinions on driving <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> alcohol. ...|$|R

Methods: In 2011, a cross-sectional survey was conducted among patients receiving services at a clinic for sexually transmitted infections in St. Petersburg, Russia. Multinomial logistic regression was used for analysis. Results: Of 299 women, 104 (34. 8 %) and 113 (37. 8 %) reported a history of IPV perpetration and victimization, respectively. Nearly half (47. 1 %) of perpetrators and 61. 1 % of victims reported that the latest IPV event (perpetration and victimization, respectively) was experienced <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> a substance. Factors independently associated with IPV victimization <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> a substance were alcohol misuse and a higher number of lifetime sex partners, whereas only experience of childhood abuse (emotional and physical abuse) was independently associated with IPV victimization that did not occur <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> a substance. Childhood physical abuse, lower age of first sex, sensation seeking, and alcohol misuse were independently associated with IPV perpetration <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> a substance, while only childhood abuse (emotional and physical abuse) was independently associated with IPV perpetration that did not occur <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> a substance.

40|$|Being <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> alcohol at work {{or during}} working hours is dealt with as misconduct. On the other hand, in a case where an {{employee}} suffers from alcoholism, such a case is treated as incapacity due to ill health. The possibility of overlap between the two has contributed to a misconception. Alcoholism cases, are at times, incorrectly treated as misconduct. The same applies to cases <b>of</b> being <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> alcohol where such cases would be treated as incapacity instead of being treated as misconduct. The distinction between alcoholism and being <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> alcohol was made clear in Transnet Freight Rail v Transnet Bargaining Council C 644 / 2009 [2011] ZALCJHB (4 March 2011) where the Labour Court held that employers have an obligation of assisting employees who suffer from alcoholism with counselling and rehabilitation. Such an obligation does not arise when an employee, who is not an alcoholic, comes to work <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> alcohol. Whilst <b>the</b> nature of work is taken into consideration in determining whether an employee is <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> alcohol or not, the major cause of disharmony in the determination is a common defence of having consumed alcohol during a night before and whether the physical observations combined with positive breathalyser test results or on their own are indicative, on the balance of probabilities, that an employee is <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> alcohol or not.

40|$|Abstract — Flexible systems which {{function}} <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> friction {{are very}} common in many applications such as flexible robot arms. The precision motion control of such systems is a difficult task because of the modelling difficulties involved in modelling friction and various flexible modes of the system. This paper presents {{the design of a}} nonlinear adaptive robust controller (ARC) to the precision motion control of a floating oscillator system <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> friction. This system consists of two masses moving on a track <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> friction and coupled by a spring. The floating oscillator acting <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> friction can be used to represent many applications such as hard disk drives and flexible robots where friction is present and the end effector position is to be controlled.
