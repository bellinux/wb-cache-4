The remaining three carriages of the Duke's train were detached and the band's carriage, hauled by Northumbrian, {{set off for}} Manchester with Stephenson driving. Lord Wilton held Huskisson's hands and arms steady, while Lord Colville supported his head {{on his knees and}} tried to cushion him from the vibration of the train. With the train almost <b>unladen</b> and Stephenson running the engine flat-out, the train reached the speed of almost , briefly giving those on board the world speed record.

2500|$|Both Magister and M.15 were wooden aircraft, {{built with}} spruce members with ply covering. [...] The M.15 {{fuselage}} though, was a monocoque structure, much more rounded in cross-section (more {{visible in the}} lower half of the fuselage) than the flat-sided and flat-bottomed Magister. The wings were built around two spruce spars with plywood webs and ribs of spruce and ply, the whole structure plywood-covered and, like the fuselage, sheathed in fabric. The <b>unladened</b> M.15 was over 40% heavier than the Magister.|$|R
25|$|The T.III's {{alternative}} undercarriages {{were both}} fixed, {{with the two}} legs independent of each, avoiding the cross bracing which would have interfered with the bomb or torpedo release. Each mainwheel was on a horizontal axle supported at the outer end by a longitudinal V-strut from the wing underside. There were two more pairs of Vs, one fixed below the wing {{and the other on}} the lower fuselage, angled towards each other to support the inner end of the axle. A tailskid completed the undercarriage. The T.III's twin float undercarriage projected just forward of the nose. The floats were mounted on the fuselage by two sets of N-struts, with diagonal transverse bracing between them, on each float. Both wood and aluminium floats were available. Fitting floats added 243kg (536lb) to the <b>unladened</b> weight and reduced the maximum speed by 11km/h (7mph).|$|R

25|$|Andes {{did make}} her first voyage on 26 September, {{but instead of}} being a {{passenger}} voyage from Southampton to South America it was a short crossing <b>unladen</b> from Belfast Lough to Holy Loch, where on 21 November the Admiralty requisitioned her to be a troop ship. She then went to Liverpool where she arrived on 26 November for modifications. Some of her passenger liner fittings were removed and stored and the remainder were panelled over with plywood.|$|E
25|$|During workdays or peak hours, {{there are}} many {{restricted}} routes on the expressways especially in the Klang Valley and Penang to ease congestion during peak hours in the morning such as Federal Highway (Sungai Rasau–Subang), New Klang Valley Expressway (Shah Alam–Jalan Duta), North–South Expressway Northern Route (Rawang–Bukit Lanjan) and Penang Bridge. Heavy vehicles (except buses and tankers) with laden and <b>unladen</b> heavy vehicles weighing 10,000kg or more {{are not allowed to}} enter the expressway between 6:30 am until 9:30 am on Monday to Friday (except public holidays). A compound fines will be issued to heavy vehicles which flouted the rule.|$|E
25|$|The {{boat was}} {{calibrated}} {{by measuring the}} height of the gunwales above water level at each corner with the boat <b>unladen</b> and then measured again when known weights had been loaded into the boat from an overhead gantry. These measurements were logged in toll-keeper's tables and copies sent to every toll office within the boat's trading range. At toll offices if a toll collector suspected an incorrect waybill (declared cargo) {{the height of the}} four corners of the boat were checked with a gauging stick and averaged to allow for uneven cargo loading. That boat's entry in the gauging table was used to determine the cargo weight. The toll fee was worked out from the weight and cargo type.|$|E
25|$|The GAU-8 {{was created}} as a {{parallel}} program with the A-X (or Attack Experimental) competition that produced the A-10. The specification for the cannon was laid out in 1970, with General Electric and Philco-Ford offering competing designs. Both of the A-X prototypes, the YA-10 and the Northrop YA-9, were designed to incorporate the weapon, {{although it was not}} available during the initial competition; the M61 Vulcan was used as a temporary replacement. Once completed, the entire GAU-8 assembly (correctly referred to as the A/A 49E-6 Gun System) represents about 16% of the A-10 aircraft's <b>unladen</b> weight. Because the gun plays a significant role in maintaining the A-10's balance and center of gravity, a jack must be installed beneath the airplane's tail whenever the gun is removed for inspection in order to prevent the aircraft from tipping rearwards.|$|E
500|$|Mont-Blanc {{was under}} {{orders from the}} French {{government}} to carry her cargo of high explosives from New York via Halifax to Bordeaux, France. At roughly 8:45am, she collided at low speed, of approximately one knot (...) , with the <b>unladen</b> Imo, chartered by the Commission for Relief in Belgium {{to pick up a}} cargo of relief supplies in New York. The resulting fire on board the French ship quickly grew out of control. Approximately 20 minutes later at 9:04:35am, the SS Mont-Blanc exploded.|$|E
500|$|Tenders {{were called}} for in 1836 for design and {{construction}} of a bridge at the village of Hadspen. Five years later the colony's government passed [...] "Reibey's ford act" [...] to facilitate construction of a bridge. The act specified that of the £1500 cost for the bridge, £500 was to be paid by the government, and the remainder by Thomas Haydock Reibey. To recover the costs Reibey was allowed to charge a toll, assisted by a toll house and by turnpikes at the bridge's ends. On construction the toll was mandated as 1d per person, 1s per wagon or carriage, 4d per <b>unladen</b> beast and 1/2d per calf, sheep, pig or lamb. The elder Reibey died before the bridge was completed and his son and executor Thomas Reibey acquired his father's rights, collecting the tolls after the bridge was completed. The toll was {{to run for the}} lesser of 30 years, or whatever time it took to pay for the original bridge construction costs plus an annual 15% interest. The wooden bridge was completed by November 1843, and within {{a little over a year}} the tolls had raised 453pounds. It was known as [...] "Reibey's Bridge" [...] and was narrowfitting only a single wagonwith a single chain each side for safety, a fact that caused the loss of at least one valuable horse.|$|E
2500|$|The airframe, largely made of fiberglass, carbon fiber, and Kevlar, weighed 939 pounds (426kg) when empty. With {{the engines}} included, the <b>unladen</b> {{weight of the}} plane was 2250lb (1020.6kg). However, when it was fully loaded before the {{historic}} flight, it weighed 9,694.5 pounds (4,397kg) due to {{the large amount of}} fuel required for the long-distance flight. The aircraft had an estimated lift-to-drag ratio (L/D) of 27. [...] The canard and wing airfoils were custom-designed, and the aircraft was analyzed using computational fluid dynamics. [...] Vortex generators were added to the canard to reduce sensitivity to surface contamination.|$|E
2500|$|This Manlove Alliott {{design was}} a {{self-propelled}} steam vehicle having a vertical boiler on each end platform {{with the engine}} mounted below the saloon floor. The upper deck had knife-board seats, back to back, with a top canopy and open sides and ends, with modesty rails. The boiler chimneys ran up and through the roof, at each end, serving coke boilers 25½ inches in diameter and [...] high. The two-cylinder steam engine had a piston bore of 7½ inches and a stroke of 9inches. <b>Unladen</b> it weighed 9 tons and was capable of carrying 50 passengers.|$|E
2500|$|The Midland railcar {{used the}} chassis of a Leyland Tiger bus, though once its body was {{constructed}} {{it did not}} look like a bus.

2500|$|Dassault's {{resulting}} prototype, dubbed Mirage IV 01, {{looked a}} lot like the Mirage IIIA, even though it had double the wing surface, two engines instead of one, and twice the <b>unladen</b> weight. The Mirage IV also carried three times more internal fuel than the Mirage III. The aircraft's aerodynamic features were very similar to the III's but required an entirely new structure and layout. This prototype was [...] long, had a [...] wingspan, [...] of wing area, and weighed approximately [...] It was considerably more advanced than the Mirage III, incorporating new features such as machined and chem-milled planks, tapered sheets, a small amount of titanium, and integral fuel tanks in many locations including the leading portion of the tailfin.|$|E
2500|$|The LCHs have {{a maximum}} payload of 180 tons; {{equivalent}} to three Leopard 1 or two M1A1 Abrams tanks, 13 M113 armored personnel carriers, 23 quarter-tonne trucks, or four LARC-V amphibious cargo vehicles. As a troop transport, a Balikpapan class vessel can transport up to 400 soldiers between a larger amphibious ship and the shore, or embark 60 soldiers in six-berth caravans for longer voyages. The vessel's payload affects the range: at 175 tons of cargo, each vessel has {{a range of}} , which increases to [...] with a 150-ton payload, and [...] when <b>unladen.</b> The flat, box-like keel causes the ships to roll considerably in other-than-calm conditions, limiting their ability to make long voyages. The LCHs can mate their bow ramp to the stern loading dock of the RAN's large amphibious warfare ships when operating in the ship-to-shore role.|$|E
2500|$|The LCM2000s were {{designed}} by ADI and were intended to be compatible with the LPAs. The craft were {{to be capable of}} mating with the stern of LPAs in order to transfer vehicles to and from the ships. Two LCM2000s were to be carried on the bow of each LPA, with the craft being lifted out of the water by the amphibious ships' 70 ton crane. The final design was for a -long vessel constructed from aluminium with a maximum displacement of 135 tonnes when fully loaded. The craft were powered by two diesel engines and two water jets which generated a maximum speed of [...] when <b>unladen</b> and [...] fully loaded. The LCM2000s were to carry loads ranging from 35 to 50 tons, including one Leopard 1 tank or up to five ASLAVs; this was three times the cargo which could be embarked in the LCM-8s.|$|E
2500|$|In 1966, {{the toll}} {{for using the}} new {{motorway}} crossing was set at 2s6d (post-decimalisation equivalent £0.125) for all vehicles apart from solo motorcycles which enjoyed a reduced toll of 1s (£0.05). For a small car the bridge toll represented a saving of 7s (£0.35) on the price, at that time 9s 6d (£0.475), of using the ferry crossing. By 1989, the toll had reached £2 each way for goods vehicle having an <b>unladen</b> weight exceeding [...] and passenger vehicles adapted to carry more than 16 passengers and £1 each way for other vehicles. Currency depreciation has been a feature of UK monetary policy in the intervening decades, and the RPI is a widely applied surrogate for the resulting impact of general price inflation: if the Severn toll had increased in line with general inflation since September 1966, when Queen Elizabeth II opened the bridge, the original value of £0.125 would have reached £2.19 each way (or £4.38 one-way) [...]|$|E
2500|$|The Docks were {{constructed}} in two phases. The two northern docks {{were constructed}} between 1800 and 1802 (officially opened on 27 August 1802) for the West India Dock Company to a design by leading civil engineer William Jessop (John Rennie was a consultant, and Thomas Morris, Liverpool's third dock engineer, was also involved; Ralph Walker was appointed resident engineer), {{and were the}} first commercial wet docks in London. British Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger and Lord Chancellor Lord Loughborough were assisted in the foundation stone ceremony on 12 July 1800 by Milligan and Hibbert. The docks were formally opened on 27 August 1802 when the <b>unladen</b> [...] was hauled in by ropes. Echo, a ship laden with cargo from the West Indies, followed. For the following 21 years all vessels in the West India trade using the Port of London were compelled to use the West India docks by a clause in the Act of Parliament that had enabled their construction.|$|E
2500|$|The {{air-cooled}} Villiers 10D [...] engine had a {{unit construction}} three-speed manual gearbox without reverse. This had an output of [...] at 4,400rpm which the manufacturers claimed gave a power-to-weight ratio of [...] per ton <b>unladen.</b> The engine unit sat in an alloy cradle {{ahead of the}} front wheel, together forming part of its support. Both front wheel and engine were sprung {{as part of the}} trailing link front suspension system, which was fitted with a single coil spring and an Andre Hartford friction damper. The rear wheels were rigidly mounted to the body on stub axles with suspension provided by low pressure [...] "balloon" [...] type tyres. Starting was achieved by using a pull handle mounted under the dash panel and connected by cable to a modified kick-start lever on the engine. The steering comprised a system of pulleys and a cable usually referred to as [...] "bobbin and cable", connecting a conventional steering wheel to the front steering unit. The bobbin and cable steering arrangement was replaced by a rack and pinion system in October 1950. Brakes were provided on only the rear wheels; they were conventional drum brakes operated by a system of cables and rods.|$|E
2500|$|The Admiralty placed {{orders for}} 30 LCAs in March 1940. By this time, Thornycroft were {{subcontracting}} with South Coast yacht-builders {{to fill the}} Admiralty's many small boat orders as Thornycroft yards were overtaxed building war-emergency convoy escorts and the like. Some LCAs - Numbers 24-29 and 51 - were fitted with Parsons conversions of the Ford V8, driving propellers similar to the standard type but on a 2:1 gear reduction; these LCAs did [...] at 3,300 revolutions. The standard engine fitted in almost all other craft was the Scripps conversion of the Ford V8. Official trial results for craft built in 1940-1 with this engine show a consistent performance with an <b>unladen</b> speed of [...] at 2,800 revolutions. June saw 64 more LCA orders, and then between late September and March 1941 another 104. These early craft {{did not yet have}} the later standard portside armoured Lewis gun position, but nevertheless, had framed canvas hold covers, scaling ladders mounted on the decks amidships, and various other refinements dropped when mass production got into full swing. The finish and performance of these early LCAs were quite fine, which might be expected as these boats were built in established Thornycroft selected yards, but in circumstances of nightly blackouts, air raids, wartime restrictions, and shortages the LCA building programme was a remarkable achievement.|$|E
2500|$|A {{separate}} {{body of research}} has implicated the posterior superior temporal sulcus {{in the perception of}} intentionality in human action; this area is also involved in perceiving biological motion, including body, eye, mouth, and point-light display motion. One study found increased pSTS activation while watching a human lift his hand versus having his hand pushed up by a piston (intentional versus unintentional action). [...] Several studies have found increased pSTS activation when subjects perceive a human action that is incongruent with the action expected from the actor's context and inferred intention. Examples would be: a human performing a reach-to-grasp motion on empty space next to an object, versus grasping the object; a human shifting eye gaze toward empty space next to a checkerboard target versus shifting gaze toward the target; an <b>unladen</b> human turning on a light with his knee, versus turning on a light with his knee while carrying a pile of books; and a walking human pausing as he passes behind a bookshelf, versus walking at a constant speed. [...] In these studies, actions in the [...] "congruent" [...] case have a straightforward goal, and are easy to explain in terms of the actor's intention. The incongruent actions, on the other hand, require further explanation (why would someone twist empty space next to a gear?), and then apparently would demand more processing in the STS. [...] Note that this region is distinct from the temporo-parietal area activated during false belief tasks. [...] Also note that pSTS activation in most of the above studies was largely right-lateralized, following the general trend in neuroimaging studies of social cognition and perception. Also right-lateralized are the TPJ activation during false belief tasks, the STS response to biological motion, and the FFA response to faces.|$|E
2500|$|The {{main line}} of the canal was {{formally}} opened on 24 June 1817, which was marked by ships on the River Tamar firing a 21-gun salute. A [...] "persistent legend" [...] states {{that much of the}} construction work had been done by French prisoners of war, but the canal committee's annual account of construction progress makes no reference to this. [...] The canal is unusual in that it was built with a gentle slope of about 1ft per mile (20cm per km). This was designed to attract industry to its banks, as it resulted in a flow of water along the canal, which aided the passage of boats towards the quay, and also enabled the powering of waterwheels along the route. Between 1817 and 1819, a [...] extension was constructed to slate quarries and a general wharf at Mill Hill. This cost £8,000, and because {{there was a lack of}} water to supply locks, the difference in level was accommodated by building a counterbalanced, double track inclined plane. Boats were loaded onto cradles, and the loaded boats passing down the incline raised the <b>unladen</b> ones, with three horses assisting if necessary. The incline was relatively shallow, as it was [...] long and only rose by [...] over this length. The rails were of [...] "L" [...] section, made of cast iron, and spaced [...] between the flanges. The cradle was about [...] long and ran on [...] cast iron wheels. The branch appears to have closed around 1831, but in 1844, the owners of a new slate quarry at Mill Hill requested that the company re-open the canal or replace it with a tramway. The canal above the Gunnislake to Tavistock road crossing was relaid as a tramway at a cost of £1,381, but the quarry was not a success, and only shipped slates between 1848 and 1850.|$|E
