[...] "You need to let them <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> need from a scene, but the actors are so much better equipped to deliver that than me", he explained. Fleming considered that using motion capture added authenticity to the characters.

500|$|Issued by Apple Records in the United States in October 1971, [...] "Imagine" [...] {{became the}} best-selling single of Lennon's solo career. It peaked at number {{three on the}} Billboard Hot 100 and reached number one in Canada on the RPM {{national}} singles chart, remaining there for two weeks. Upon its release the song's lyrics upset some religious groups, particularly the line: [...] "Imagine there's no heaven". When asked about the song {{during one of his}} final interviews, Lennon said he considered it to be as strong a composition as any he had written with the Beatles.

Now I <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have to do. Put your political message across with a little honey." [...] In an open letter to Paul McCartney published in Melody Maker, Lennon said that [...] "Imagine" [...] was [...] "'Working Class Hero' with sugar on it for conservatives like yourself". On 30 November 1971, the Imagine LP reached number one on the UK chart. It became the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed album of Lennon's solo career.|$|E

These contacts of March 4 may have been the birth of the toponyms Yucatán and Catoche, whose surprising and amusing history [...] perhaps too amusing to be true [...] is often cited. Be it history or legend, the story is that the Spaniards asked the Indians for the name of the land they had just discovered and on hearing the predictable replies to the effect of [...] "I don't <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> said", [...] "those are our houses" [...] gave the land names based on what they had heard: Yucatán, meaning [...] "I don't understand you" [...] for the whole [...] "province" [...] (or island, as they thought), and Catoche, meaning [...] "our houses", for the settlement and the cape where they had debarked.|$|E
