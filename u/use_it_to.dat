5|$|A {{food web}} is the archetypal {{ecological}} network. Plants capture solar energy and <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> synthesize simple sugars during photosynthesis. As plants grow, they accumulate nutrients and are eaten by grazing herbivores, {{and the energy}} is transferred through a chain of organisms by consumption. The simplified linear feeding pathways that move from a basal trophic species to a top consumer is called the food chain. The larger interlocking pattern of food chains in an ecological community creates a complex food web. Food webs are a type of concept map or a heuristic device {{that is used to}} illustrate and study pathways of energy and material flows.|$|E
5|$|After the Kid {{returns and}} recovers, Rucks gives him another choice: He {{can have the}} Bastion rewind time to before the Calamity {{in the hopes of}} {{preventing}} it, or <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> evacuate the survivors and move on to somewhere safe. Rucks is unsure if there is any way to prevent the Calamity from reoccurring if the time is rewound, as {{there was no way to}} test the process. The game ends either way, showing images of the characters (with the inclusion of Zulf if the player chose to rescue him) flying away or of their lives before the Calamity along with the credits. In the New Game+ mode, which is unlocked after beating the game once, it is hinted that restoring the world didn't prevent the Calamity.|$|E

At The Hub, a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility run by Agent Victoria Hand, it is revealed that a South Ossetian separatist group has built a weapon called the Overkill device, which uses sonic vibrations to trigger other weapons from great distances.

Moments later Ljungberg beat his marker and crossed {{the ball into the}} penalty area, only for Bergkamp to drag his shot wide. United threatened once the game reached the hour mark, winning duels and earning set-pieces. Gabriel Heinze's shot from about 20 yards tested Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann in the 65th minute. Five minutes later Wenger substituted Reyes off in place of Pirès.|$|E

The Aes Sedai work with Rand to interrogate Semirhage, another Forsaken captured {{at the end of}} Knife of Dreams. After being freed by her allies, Semirhage is given a Domination Band, an item used to control male channelers, and locks it around Rand's neck. She and Black Ajah sister Elza Penfell <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> make him torture and attempt to kill his lover, Min Farshaw. Unable to channel, he reaches out and inexplicably accesses the True Power, a different power normally only granted by the Dark One, using it to free himself and kill Semirhage and Elza. After this, he resolves to make himself harder and emotionless. He banishes his adviser Cadsuane Melaidhrin for not securing the Domination Band, promising to kill her if he sees her face again.|$|E

5|$|At Eurocorp New York HQ, Denham and Merit believe Kilo is brain-dead {{and send}} him to be rebooted while they plan to {{retrieve}} Lily's chip and recover useful information on DART 6. Kilo begins to remember his secret past: he learns that Denham led a Eurocorp team to kill his parents and abduct him as a baby because he has genes ideal for becoming an agent. Kilo escapes from his restraints and rescues Lily, who tells Kilo that like him, all of Eurocorp's agents were abducted as children and their memories were modified so they would remain loyal to Eurocorp. Lily created the DART 6 chip, hoping to <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> make the syndicates retain their humanity and care about both chipped and un-chipped civilians, but she realizes she was naïve to think that way.|$|E
5|$|At Moe's Tavern, Moe informs Homer and {{his friends}} {{that one of them}} must be a {{designated}} driver, and Barney loses the choosing draw. After Barney drives the drunken men home in Homer's car, Homer allows him to <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> drive himself home, expecting Barney to return it the following morning. In his distressed state, Barney disappears with the car. Two months later, Barney returns to Moe's Tavern, unable to recall where he left the car. Homer later receives a letter from the New York City government, which informs him that his car has been found parked in the World Trade Center plaza. Homer reveals to the family that he had once been to New York before when he was 17 years old and had a horrible experience. Marge and the children persuade Homer to go retrieve the car and he reluctantly agrees.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of Riven, Atrus equips the player with a trap book—a snare that functions as a one-man prison, yet looks identical to a linking book—and his personal diary. This diary summarizes the history of events leading to the present situation; Atrus cannot explain in depth as he is engaged in rewriting the descriptive book of Riven, {{in an attempt to}} slow its deterioration. The player must enter the Age with no way of leaving, as Atrus cannot risk sending a real linking book to Riven until Gehn is safely imprisoned lest he <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> escape Riven. Instructing the player to capture Gehn in the trap book, find Catherine, and then signal him, Atrus holds out the link book that will transport the player to Riven.|$|E
