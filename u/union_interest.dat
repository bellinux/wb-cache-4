25|$|On February 1, 1968, the New York Central {{was absorbed}} by the Pennsylvania Railroad, forming the new Pennsylvania New York Central Transportation Company that was {{eventually}} renamed the Penn Central Transportation Company, with the NYC's Alfred Perlman as president. Penn Central was quickly saddled with debt when the ICC forced the money-losing New Haven into the railroad in 1969. In addition, the merger was handled in a haphazard manner with no formal merger plan implemented. The two companies' competing corporate cultures, <b>union</b> <b>interest,</b> and incompatible operating and computer systems sabotaged any hope for a success. Additionally {{in an effort to}} look profitable, the board of directors authorized the use of the railroad's reserve cash to pay dividends to company stockholders. Nevertheless, on June 21, 1970 Penn Central declared bankruptcy, the largest private bankruptcy in the United States to that time. Under bankruptcy protection many of Penn Central's outstanding debts owed to other railroads were frozen, while debts owed to Penn Central by the other roads were not. This sent a trickle effect throughout the already fragile railroad industry forcing many of the other Northeastern railroads into insolvency, among them the Erie Lackawanna, Boston and Maine, the Central Railroad of New Jersey, the Reading Company, and the Lehigh Valley.|$|E

A museum named in honor of she and her sister, the Adelaide and Eugenia Gertsyk Museum of Silver Age, was established in Sudak and poetry readings of their work commenced in 1996. In 2006, Natalia K.

A domestic labor <b>union</b> <b>interested</b> in both {{employment and wages}} bargains with a foreign firm and lobbies against foreign imports.

We also conduct comparative statics analysis on wages and lobbying efforts. Copyright 1996 Blackwell Publishers Ltd [...] ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} the cost channel of monetary policy (e. g., Ravenna and Walsh, 2006) into an otherwise standard New Keynesian {{model of a}} two-country monetary union, which is being hit by aggregate, asymmetric and idiosyncratic shocks. The single central bank implements the optimal discretionary monetary policy by setting the <b>union</b> <b>interest</b> rate. The cost channel makes monetary policy less effective in combating in?action, but it is shown that the optimal response to the decline in effectiveness is a stronger use of the instrument. Moreover, we show how {{the sign of the}} spillover effects of idiosyncratic shocks depends on the strength of the cost channel. If the cost channel exceeds a well-defined threshold, then the interest rate turns into a supply-side instrument. cost channel; optimal monetary policy; monetary union; open economy macroeconomics...|$|E
40|$|The {{number of}} {{interest}} organizations (density) varies across policy domains, political issues and economic sectors. This shapes {{the nature and}} outcomes of interest representation. In this contribution, we explain the density of interest organizations per economic sector in the European Union {{on the basis of}} political and economic institutional factors. Focusing on business interest representation, we show that economic institutions structure the ‘supply’ of interest organizations by affecting the number of potential constituents, the resources available for lobbying and the geographical level of collective action of businesses. In contrast, we do not find consistent evidence that political institutions produce ‘demand’ for interest organizations by making laws, developing public policy or spending money. This is in contrast to the extensive evidence that such factors affect lobbying practices. The European <b>Union</b> <b>interest</b> system is (partially) shaped by economic factors, relatively independent from public policy or institutions...|$|E
40|$|The {{political}} economy of the United States during {{the last thirty years}} has been described as neoliberal. Part of the neoliberal turn involves reducing or eliminating income support programs such as AFDC/TANF, waging war against organized labor, and increasingly conservative (i. e., neoliberal) public policies. Following an analysis by Lewis (2001) which showed that wages increased in response to higher average monthly AFDC payments, I update and expand this test of Piven and Cloward 2 ̆ 7 s bargaining power theory of wages by looking at other factors which may influence worker bargaining power: <b>unions,</b> <b>interest</b> rates, policy liberalism, and economic growth.

The alternative is to exclude foreign workers partially or completely from union membership. Exclusion could drive a wedge into the labour movement, eventually weakening its negotiating position.
