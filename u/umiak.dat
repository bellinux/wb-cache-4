5|$|In 1937, Wordie {{organised}} {{an expedition}} to North West Greenland to investigate cosmic radiation at high latitudes and great altitudes. He assembled a team of ten men, nine of whom were from Cambridge University, among them Lethbridge and two other archaeologists. Setting sail in June 1937, Lethbridge undertook excavations of Eskimo sites at Rhyder Island, Cary Island, North West Island, and Isbjörn Island. On returning home in October 1937, {{it was decided that}} various geographical features encountered would be named after team members, and thus two lakes on Baffin Island were named the Lethbridge Lakes. During the trip, Lethbridge became particularly interested in the design of Eskimo boats, resulting in the self-publication of his 11-page booklet, <b>Umiak</b> – the European Ancestry of the 'Women's Boat, in 1937. He followed this with a second book, The Fishermen of Durness (1938), in which he argued that a study of contemporary traditional fishing communities could inform archaeologists more about ancient boat-making and fishing.|$|E

50|$|Skin boats {{dominated}} seafaring {{in places}} that were scarce on wood, including the arctic and subarctic. They were made by stretching skin or leather over frames of wood or bone. These include kayaks and <b>umiaks,</b> coracles and currachs.|$|R
25|$|The account above {{follows the}} H.W. McCurdy Marine History of the Pacific Northwest. A {{somewhat}} different account, with Swenson on the King & Winge with Jochimsen and commanding the <b>umiak</b> that landed on Wrangel Island {{is given by}} Burt McConnell, a contemporary eyewitness, and other sources. The origin of this difference is unclear.|$|E
25|$|In 1914 Hibbard-Swenson Company {{chartered}} {{the newly}} built motor schooner King & Winge to carry relief {{supplies to the}} Belvedere and complete the normal trading run. King & Winge became stuck in the ice near Point Barrow and bent her propeller. The ship was extricated by the revenue cutter Bear on August 22. They met the Belvedere at Point Barrow, delivered the supplies, took on some crewmen from the Elvira, and subsequently put into at Nome August 30. Bear arrived the same day and reported that its attempt to rescue {{the crew of the}} Karluk from Wrangel Island off the northeast Siberian coast had been thwarted by bad weather, ice and low fuel. Stefansson's former secretary Burt McConnell then requested that King & Winge attempt a rescue; this request was reiterated by Captain Bartlett of the Karluk. Swenson set out for Wrangel Island in the King & Winge with A.P. Jochimsen as Master. They stopped at East Cape, Siberia, and picked up an <b>umiak</b> and a party of natives to man it, in case they had to cross ice interspersed with open water. As they approached the beach in the <b>umiak,</b> the native crew was alarmed to see one of the Karluk survivors vigorously pumping a rifle, but Swenson reassured them in their language. They removed a total of twelve expedition survivors from two separate camps. The survivors included an Inupiaq couple and their two children. The survivors were later transferred to the Bear.|$|E
500|$|The {{ship was}} also {{outfitted}} with four whaleboats, [...] long and [...] wide, and a flat-bottomed scow. During his previous Arctic expeditions, Hall came {{to admire the}} Inuit <b>umiak,</b> and brought a similarly constructed collapsible boat which could hold 20men. Food packed on board consisted of tinned ham, salted beef, bread and sailor's biscuit. The men intended to supplement their diet with fresh muskox, seal and polar bear, in order to ward off scurvy.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, {{transportation}} {{was primarily}} by dog sleds (land) and kayaks (water). Sea mammal {{hunting and fishing}} in the Bering Sea region took place from both small narrow closed skin-covered boats called kayaks and larger broad open skin-covered boats called <b>umiaks.</b> Kayaks were used more frequently than <b>umiaks.</b> Traditionally, kayaking and umiaking served as water transportation and sea hunting. Dog sleds are ideal land transportation. Pedestrian transportation is on foot in summer and snowshoes in winter. Only small local road systems exist in Southwest Alaska. Only a few closely adjacent villages are linked by roads. Today, snowmobile or snowmachine travel is {{a critical component of}} winter transport; an ice road for highway vehicles is used along portions of the Kuskokwim River.|$|R
25|$|During the Nome {{gold rush}} {{at the turn}} of the 20th century, Diomede villagers {{traveled}} to Nome along with the gold seekers, even though Nome was not a native village. People from Diomede arrived in <b>Umiaks</b> and stayed in Nome for the summer, trading and gathering items before they returned to their isolated village.|$|R
50|$|In the 1950s, Talirunili {{focused more}} on sculptures. He carved {{migration}} scenes of <b>umiaks,</b> Inuit men and women, hunting scenes and caribou. After a decade of sculpting, he got into printmaking graphics in the 1960s. In all of Joe’s work, sculptures, prints and drawings, he tells stories from his traditions, childhood and people’s lives, camp life, hunting scenes, owls, other animals and his famous “migration” works.|$|R

2500|$|An {{extraordinary}} {{feature of}} the Jensen collection is a [...] <b>umiak,</b> an Inuit boat with a frame constructed of driftwood and covered with walrus skins. This boat was given to Jensen by those inhabiting St. Lawrence Island in the Bering Sea, and he used the boat to circle the island during a native hunt. Other large items include a traditional Inuit home constructed of stones, hides, whalebone, and driftwood {{as well as a}} [...] long sled and a sod house.|$|E

25|$|When Alaska {{was still}} {{connected}} to Siberia over 10,000 {{years ago by}} the Bering Land Bridge, the Little Diomede was not an island, but {{was a part of the}} Beringia and accessible by foot. However, it is unknown if humans visited the grounds of the Little Diomede at that time. Most likely, first visitors to the island came simply by foot on top of the sea ice. Later the <b>Umiaks</b> were used for visiting the neighboring Big Diomede island, whale hunting, fishing, and later, to access mainlands in Alaska and Siberia. Boats made out of driftwood and whale skin are still used today.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} {{stages of the}} Thule tradition: Old Bering Sea Stage, Punuk Stage, and Birnirk Stage. These stages {{represent}} variations of the Thule Tradition as it expanded over time. The Thule Tradition replaced the Dorset Tradition in the Eastern Arctic and introduced both kayaks and <b>umiaks,</b> or skin covered boats, into the archaeological record as well as developed new uses for iron and copper and demonstrated advanced harpoon technology and use of bowhead whales, the largest animal in the Arctic. and spread across the coasts of Labrador and Greenland. It is the most recent “neo-Eskimo” culture.|$|R

50|$|A strong {{maritime}} adaptation {{is characteristic}} of the Thule, and the OBS stage, and then {{can be seen in}} the archaeological evidence. Both Kayaks and <b>umiaks</b> (large skinned boats) appear in the archaeological record for the first time. The toolkits of the people of the time are dominated by polished-slate rather than flaked-stone artifacts, including lanceolate knives, projectile heads, and the ulu transverse-bladed knife. The people also made a crude form of pottery and there was much use of bone and antlers to use as heads on harpoons, as well as to make darts, spears, snow goggles, blubber scrapers, needles, awls and mattocks, also walrus shoulder-blade snow shovels.|$|R
50|$|Eskimos used open boats called <b>umiaks,</b> and {{the smaller}} kayaks, to hunt large sea mammals. Both vessels were made of a {{driftwood}} frame, covered with tightly sewn seal skins. Sleds and dog teams were used for winter travel, and during the summer, dogs were used as pack animals. Women were skilled in basketry and sewing. They stitched and fitted waterproof garments made of animal intestine and fish skins. The Eskimos' everyday clothing of trousers, boots, and coats was sewn from skins and fur, sometimes in complex geometric designs. The coats, which were called parkas, featured an attached hood and a ruff of wolf or bear fur.|$|R
50|$|Archaeological {{projects}} {{in the region have}} suggested human habitation in the region that includes Aasiaat {{as far back as the}} 5th millennium BC. The earliest modern settlers dated to around 1200; these were probably subsistence hunters. These inhabitants hunted harp seals and capelin (ammassaat) near Sydøst Bay in the spring. In the summer, they moved to Nassuttooq for reindeer and halibut. During autumn, the people of Disko Bay returned home to hunt small harp seals. In the winter, the bay froze over, and they hunted narwhals and Beluga whales. These early people designed and built their own kayaks and <b>umiaks</b> when the water freed up; in the winter, they used dogsleds.|$|R

50|$|Peder Olsen Walloe {{was born}} on the Baltic Sea island of Bornholm. In 1739, he came to Greenland as one of five colonists called by Lutheran missionary Hans Egede. He learned to speak the {{language}} Kalaallisut and settled as a trader with permission to operate outside the Godthåb colony. During 1751-53, Walløe explored the southern coasts of Greenland {{on behalf of the}} Danish mission. The aim was to locate the lost Eastern Norse Settlement which was commonly believed to be located on the east coast of Greenland. In August 1751, Walloe left Godthaab in a native boat accompanied by two Danish sailors and two Eskimo rowers. The expedition used <b>umiaks</b> able to navigate in the shallow waters between the coast and the sea ice.|$|R
50|$|Wilhelm August Graah (1793-1863) was a Danish {{naval officer}} and Arctic explorer. Graah had mapped areas of West Greenland when he, in 1828 - 30, was sent on an {{expedition}} to the uninhabited eastern coast with the purpose {{to search for the}} lost Eastern Norse Settlement. The expedition set out from Copenhagen in the brig Hvalfisken, but - once arrived in Greenland - used <b>umiaks</b> able to navigate in the shallow waters between the coast and the sea ice. The expedition reached Dannebrog Islands (65° 18' N), but returned under great suffering and without having reached the inhabited areas in Tasiilaq. Two naturalists participated - the geologist Christian Pingel and the botanist Jens Vahl.Graah published an account of the exploration.|$|R
5000|$|Steller's sea cow was {{described}} as being [...] "tasty" [...] by Steller; the meat {{was said to have}} a similar taste to corned beef, though it was tougher, redder, and needed to be cooked for longer. Due to the sea cow's size, the meat was plentiful, and it lasted a long time, perhaps due the high amount of salt in the animal's diet. This delayed spoiling to some extent, with the salt effectively curing it. The sea cow's fat could be used for cooking and as an odorless lamp oil. The thick, sweet milk of female sea cows could be drunk or made into butter, and the thick, leathery hide could be used to make clothing such as shoes and belts and large skin boats sometimes called baidarkas or <b>umiaks.</b>|$|R
50|$|The open <b>umiak</b> is {{significantly}} {{larger than the}} enclosed kayak which was built to carry one or two men while hunting. Normally 9 or 10 m the <b>umiak</b> would be anywhere from 6 to 10 m and 1.5 - 2 m wide. Hans Egede, a Norwegian-Danish Lutheran missionary to Greenland in 1721, stated {{that he had seen}} umiaks 60 ft long.|$|E
50|$|The skin {{cover on}} an <b>umiak</b> {{will last for}} two or three years, as does an {{aluminum}} boat used in the same way; however, replacing the skin on an <b>umiak</b> is much easier than repairing an aluminum boat. Additionally, the bowhead whale is sensitive to the metallic noise from aluminum boats, and tend to move away under the ice, to avoid them.|$|E

50|$|The {{area was}} one of great {{wildlife}} diversity which may have attracted the normally marine mammal hunting Thule. The island would have helped them ensure a more stable lifestyle with access to alternate food sources. Although {{it is estimated that}} population did not exceed 25 people on the island at a time, more than 3,000 tools and 20,000 bones have been found. The area shows evidence of at least 11 sod houses and there are stone rings and tent remains, which indicates that the island was used both in summer and winter. Although there are few remains today the large number of seal and whale bones suggest that the inhabitants used <b>umiaks</b> and qajaq. In 1860 when Charles Francis Hall visited the area his Inuit guides were able to harvest a large amount of food from there.|$|R
50|$|Between A.D. 900 and A.D. 1100 the Thule Tradition spread westward. The {{efficiency}} of housing was improved as they {{spread to the}} west and hunting methods were improved due to the use of dog sleds, <b>umiaks,</b> and kayaks. This enabled the hunters to travel further to hunt and follow the migration of the large game and sea mammals. After A.D. 1000 the practice of using polished slate for tool making continued to spread to the Aleutian Islands. The methods of pottery making also spread and replaced the Norton tradition in Southern Alaska. There were differences between the areas to which the tradition migrated. Houses in the more eastern region were more above ground and round with stone platforms to sleep on. The shape and support for the buildings came from whale bones. Eastern populations preferred soapstone domestic items instead of pottery and developed the use of dogs to pull sleds.|$|R
50|$|Whaling has {{a greater}} {{emphasis}} in the Punuk stage. Hunters would use <b>umiaks</b> and kill whales in narrow ice leads {{as well as in}} the open sea in the fall. Open sea whaling required skilled leadership, teams of expert boatmen and hunters, and the cooperation of several boats. The whaleboat captain, the umialik, is still a prominent position in Arctic communities today.Chipped stone tools were replaced by ground slate, ivory winged tolls were largely replaced by tridents, and iron-tipped tools were used for engraving. Harpoon styles became simpler and more standardised, as did Punuk art. The Punuk developed their methods of hunting that led to the creation of armor made from bone as well as the technology of the bow and arrow. As well, bone plated wrist guards, the reinforced bow, bird bola, heavy ivory net sinkers, and blunt tipped bird arrows appeared in the Punuk stage.|$|R
