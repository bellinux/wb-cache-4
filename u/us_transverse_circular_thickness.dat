It is a dimension measured along a line or curve in the transverse, normal, or axial directions. The use of the single word pitch without qualification may be ambiguous, {{and for this reason}} it is preferable to use specific designations such as <b>transverse</b> <b>circular</b> pitch, normal base pitch, axial pitch.|$|R

The measured values of the cylinder center-point temperature confirmed the salient point of the heat-transfer analysis which was the prediction that an insulated cylinder would attain a temperature higher than the stagnation temperature of the stream. Good agreement was obtained between the theoretical and the experimental values for the drag coefficient...|$|R

The method replaces the high-voltage sweep component of a conventional streak camera by a TM 110 -mode RF cavity, which performs a <b>transverse</b> <b>circular</b> sweep of the electron bunch in the streak tube through a rotating magnetic field. The proposed method also allows one to overcome the problem of triggering, which is a serious limitation of conventional streak cameras...|$|R
50|$|Hydrostatic skeletons are {{typically}} {{arranged in a}} cylinder. Hydrostatic skeletons can be controlled by several different muscle types. Length can be adjusted by longitudinal muscle fibers parallel to the longitudinal axis. The muscle fibers {{may be found in}} continuous sheets or isolated bundles, and the diameter can be manipulated by three different muscle types: <b>circular,</b> radial, and <b>transverse.</b> <b>Circular</b> musculature wraps around the circumference of the cylinder, radial musculature extends {{from the center of the}} cylinder towards the surface, and transverse musculature arrange in parallel and perpendicular sheets crossing the diameter of the cylinder.|$|R

Satisfactory agreement is obtained with some previously published experimental results, although computed maximum stress concentration factors are generally higher than those obtained experimentally.

Three T-beams with circular openings tested earlier by the authors have been chosen, and a strut-and-tie model was constructed for each beam. A comparison of the theoretical predictions concerning the ultimate strength, mode of failure and the proportion of applied shear carried by the chord members above and below the opening show good agreement with test results. The truss model also explains clearly the role of diagonal reinforcement in relieving concrete distress at the throat section by transferring a significant amount of applied shear across the discontinuity...|$|R
50|$|The muscles {{perpendicular}} to the long axis may be arranged in a <b>transverse,</b> <b>circular,</b> or radial pattern. A transverse arrangement involves sheets of muscle fibers running {{perpendicular to}} the long axis, usually alternating between horizontal and vertical orientations. This arrangement {{is found in the}} arms and tentacles of squid, octopuses, and in most mammalian tongues. A radial arrangement involves fibers radiating out in all directions {{from the center of the}} organ. This is found in the tentacles of the chambered nautilus and in the elephant proboscis (trunk). A circular arrangement has rings of contractive fibers around the long axis. This is found in many mammalian and lizard tongues along with squid tentacles.|$|R

40|$|A two {{dimensional}} (2 D) transient thermal model with line-heat-source {{was developed by}} Finite Element Method (FEM) for laser surface glazing of H 13 tool steel using commercial software-ANSYS 15. The geometry of the model was taken as a <b>transverse</b> <b>circular</b> cross-section of cylindrical specimen. Two different power levels (300 W, 200 W) were used with 0. 2 mm width of laser beam and 0. 15 ms exposure time. Temperature distribution, heating and cooling rates, and the dimensions of modified surface were analysed. The maximum temperatures achieved were 2532 K (2259 °C) and 1592 K (1319 °C) for laser power 300 W and 200 W respectively. The maximum cooling rates were 4. 2 × 107  K/s for 300 W and 2 × 107 K/s for 200 W. Depths of modified zone increased with increasing laser power. From this analysis, it can be predicted that for 0. 2 mm beam width and 0. 15 ms time exposer melting temperature of H 13 tool steel is achieved within 200 - 300 W power range of laser beam in laser surface glazing...|$|R

The pulp fibres were frozen as a suspension, and they were embedded in the washing water. The <b>circular</b> <b>transverse</b> sections of the pulp fibres exhibited various shapes suggesting that the wood chips were successfully separated into independent fibres and the fibres oriented randomly in the suspension.|$|R

5000|$|The bending of {{a muscular}} hydrostat {{can occur in}} two ways, both of which {{require the use of}} {{antagonistic}} muscles. The unilateral contraction of a longitudinal muscle will produce little or no bending and will serve to increase the diameter of the muscular hydrostat because of the constant volume principle that must be met. To bend the hydrostat structure, the unilateral contraction of longitudinal muscle must be accompanied by contractile activity of <b>transverse,</b> radial, or <b>circular</b> muscles to maintain a constant diameter. Bending of a muscular hydrostat can also occur by the contraction of <b>transverse,</b> radial, or <b>circular</b> muscles which decreases the diameter. Bending is produced by longitudinal muscle activity which maintains a constant length {{on one side of the}} structure.|$|R
40|$|Presented herein is a {{canonical}} exact deflection {{expression for}} stepped (or piecewise-constant <b>thickness)</b> <b>circular</b> plates under rotationally symmetric <b>transverse</b> loads. The <b>circular</b> plates may be either simply supported or clamped at the edges. As the plates {{may be very}} thick or certain portions of the optimal design may become rather thick, the significant effect of transverse shear deformation on the deflections cannot be ignored. This effect was taken into consideration in accordance to the Mindlin plate theory. Based on the analytical deflection expression, necessary conditions are derived for the optimal values of segmental lengths and thicknesses that minimize the maximum deflection of stepped circular plates of a given volume. These optimality conditions are solved using the Newton method for the optimal segmental lengths and thicknesses. Local minima are observed for this nonlinear problem at hand and they may pose some difficulties in getting the solutions. The shear deformation effect increases the plate deflections, but interestingly it affects the thickness variation marginally. Department of Applied Mathematic...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{of the origin of}} oblique vortex shedding in the laminar wake of circular cylinders was conducted in the range of Reynolds numbers from 40 to 160. Two <b>transverse</b> <b>circular</b> cylinders were positioned upstream of the main shedding cylinder to control the angle of shedding from the main cylinder. The respective distances between each transverse cylinder and the main cylinder were used to induce oblique shedding of different angles, curved shedding, as well as parallel shedding. Measurements of the mean static pressure distribution in the base region of the cylinder and of the mean spanwise component of the velocity in the wake were taken. These measurements revealed that a non-symmetric pressure distribution, which induced a spanwise flow in the base region of the cylinder, was responsible for the oblique shedding. By using a simple model based on the ratio of the streamwise to the spanwise vorticity components, the angle of shedding was predicted within 2 " of the value measured from flow visualization. The vorticity was simply evaluated from the spanwise and streamwise velocity profiles of oblique vortex streets obtained with the LDV measurement technique. Parallel vortex shedding showed a symmetric pressure distribution with zero spanwise component of the velocity and zero cross-shear in the cylinder base. It was shown that parallel vortex shedding results in a continuous Strouhal-Reynolds number curve...|$|R
40|$|We propose an {{innovative}} linear accelerating structure, particularly suited for hadrontherapy applications. Its two main features are compactness and good power efficiency at low beam velocities: {{the first is}} achieved through a high working frequency and a consequent high accelerating gradient, the second is obtained by coupling several H-mode cavities together. The structure is called CLUSTER, which stands for "Coupled-cavity Linac <b>USing</b> <b>Transverse</b> Electric Radial field". In order to compare the performance of this structure with other hadrontherapy linac designs involving high frequencies, a conceptual study has been performed for an operating frequency of 3 GHz. Moreover a proof of principle has been obtained through RF measurements on a prototype operating at 1 GHz. An accelerator complex using a CLUSTER linac is also considered for protontherapy purposes. The whole complex is called cyclinac and is composed of a commercial cyclotron injecting the beam in a high-frequency linac. Comment: for submission to Nucl. Instr. Meth. ...|$|R

The general mutual admittance expression is evaluated for circular apertures and the mutual coupling calculations are verified experimentally for two <b>transverse</b> electric <b>circular</b> waveguide mode excited apertures. A parametric study of higher order mode aperture fields indicates that the only {{significant change in the}} circular aperture mutual coupling is due to the transverse magnetic mode, which introduces an additional phase shift.

40|$|Hot-wire {{velocity}} {{measurements are}} carried out in a turbulent boundary layer over a rough wall consisting of <b>transverse</b> <b>circular</b> rods, with a ratio of 8 between the spacing (w) of two consecutive rods and the rod height (k). The pressure distribution around the roughness element is used to accurately measure the mean friction velocity (U τ) and the error in the origin. It is found that U τ remained practically constant in the streamwise direction suggesting that the boundary layer over this surface is evolving in a self-similar manner. This is further corroborated by the similarity observed at all scales of motion, in the region 0. 2 ≤y/δ≤ 0. 6, {{as reflected in the}} constancy of Reynolds number (R λ) based on Taylor's microscale and the collapse of Kolmogorov normalized velocity spectra at all wavenumbers. A scale-by-scale budget for the second-order structure function 〈(δu) ²〉 (δu=u(x+r) -u(x), where u is the fluctuating streamwise velocity component and r is the longitudinal separation) is carried out to investigate the energy distribution amongst different scales in the boundary layer. It is found that while the small scales are controlled by the viscosity, intermediate scales over which the transfer of energy (or 〈(δu) ³〉) is important are affected by mechanisms induced by the large-scale inhomogeneities in the flow, such as production, advection and turbulent diffusion. For example, there are non-negligible contributions from the large-scale inhomogeneity to the budget at scales of the order of λ, the Taylor microscale, in the region of the boundary layer extending from y/δ= 0. 2 to 0. 6 (δ is the boundary layer thickness) ...|$|R
