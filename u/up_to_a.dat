5|$|A planet's {{defining}} {{physical characteristic}} {{is that it}} is massive enough for the force of its own gravity to dominate over the electromagnetic forces binding its physical structure, leading to a state of hydrostatic equilibrium. This effectively means that all planets are spherical or spheroidal. <b>Up</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> certain mass, an object can be irregular in shape, but beyond that point, which varies depending on the chemical makeup of the object, gravity begins to pull an object towards its own centre of mass until the object collapses into a sphere.|$|E

5|$|Bird {{migration}} routes {{have been}} studied {{by a variety of}} techniques including the oldest, marking. Swans have been marked with a nick on the beak since about 1560 in England.

The rate of bird migration over the Alps (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> height of 150 m) was found to be highly comparable between fixed-beam radar measurements and visual bird counts, highlighting the potential use of this technique as an objective way of quantifying bird migration.|$|E
