The growth kinetics of spherulites from the molten state and the corresponding <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallization</b> under similar cooling rates are considered.

40|$|The {{thermoluminescence}} (TL) {{characteristics of}} quartz are highly dependent of its thermal history.

However, little is know about the influence <b>of</b> the <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> quartz <b>crystallization</b> on its TL characteristics. In the present study, we evaluate the TL sensitivity and dose response curves of hydrothermal and metamorphic quartz with crystallization temperatures from 209 +/- 15 to 633 +/- 27 degrees C determined through fluid inclusion and mineral chemistry analysis. The studied crystals present a cooling thermal history, which allow the acquiring of their natural TL without influence <b>of</b> heating after <b>crystallization.</b> The TL curves of the studied samples present two main components formed by different peaks overlapped around 110 C and 200 - 400 degrees C. The TL sensitivity in the 200 - 400 degrees C region increases linearly with the <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> quartz <b>crystallization.</b> No relationship was observed between <b>temperatures</b> <b>of</b> quartz <b>crystallization</b> and saturation doses (< 100 Gy). The elevated TL sensitivity <b>of</b> the high <b>temperature</b> quartz is attributed to the control exerted by the <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallization</b> on the substitution of Si(4 +) by ions such as Al(3 +) and Ti(4 +), which produce defects responsible for luminescence phenomena.

The relative abundance of quartz in the earth crust and the easiness to measure TL are advantageous in relation to geothermometry methods based on chemistry of other minerals. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The discrepancy between the experimental data and the field petrologic observations lies {{in the nature of}} the experiments done by Rosenberg (1972). The <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallization</b> was derived from synthesis experiments on the assemblage topaz, qvartz, and mullite or pyrophyllite from oxide mixes. Synthesis experiments are well known to give higher <b>temperatures</b> <b>of</b> stability than equilibrium phase-boundary determinations (Johannes, 1968; Moody, 1976). The few higher temperature (> 600 oC) rever-sals (Fig. 7, Rosenberg, 1972) do not give enough constraint on the slope of the curve to use that curve to extrapolate to lower temperatures. The synthetic mullite-bearing assemblages with topaz may have the proper bulk composition for comparison with the as-semblage topaz*andalusite observed at Hillsborough (Sykes and Moody, 1978), but the crystallization temperature determined from those experiments (Rosenberg, 1972) wrll not be valid for the andalu-site-topaz assemblage for the same reasons as noted above.

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this study was to examine cell {{viability}} after freezing.

The lower temperature range was related to recrystallization that occurred during thawing. Mortality in this temperature range was increased by a high cooling rate and/or high solute concentration in the freezing medium and a low temperature (less than − 70 °C). However, a high rate of thawing prevented yeast mortality in this lower temperature range.

Design/methodology/approach: Samples were thermally cycled between room <b>temperature</b> and increasing <b>upper</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> the thermal cycle and the logarithmic decrement were measured at room temperature.

Research limitations/implications: Redistribution of solute atoms during thermal cycles is the reason for the observed changes in the amplitude dependence of decrement. Thermal stresses arise in the composite at the interfaces between the matrix and the reinforcement owing to a considerable mismatch of the thermal expansion coefficients of the matrix and that of the reinforcement.
