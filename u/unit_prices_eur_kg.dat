40|$|In many product categories, <b>unit</b> <b>prices</b> {{facilitate}} price comparisons across {{brands and}} package sizes; this enables consumers {{to identify those}} products that provide the greatest value. However in other product categories, <b>unit</b> <b>prices</b> may be confusing. This is because {{there are two types}} of <b>unit</b> <b>pricing,</b> measure-based and usage-based. Measure-based <b>unit</b> <b>prices</b> are what the name implies; price is expressed in cents or dollars per unit of measure (e. g. ounce). Usage-based <b>unit</b> <b>prices,</b> on the other hand, are expressed in terms of cents or dollars per use (e. g., wash load or serving). The results of this study show that in two different product categories (i. e., laundry detergent and dry breakfast cereal), measure-based <b>unit</b> <b>prices</b> reduced consumers’ ability to identify higher value products, but when a usage-based <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> was provided, their ability to identify product value was increased. When provided with both a measure-based and a usage-based <b>unit</b> <b>price,</b> respondents did not perform as well as when they were provided only a usage-based <b>unit</b> <b>price,</b> additional evidence that the measure-based <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> hindered consumers’ comparisons.

40|$|That {{displaying}} <b>unit</b> <b>prices</b> leads {{consumers to}} choose lower <b>unit</b> <b>priced</b> product options is well established. However, whether this effect occurs persistently across purchase conditions is unclear, and if so, why? This paper proposes {{that the presence}} of <b>unit</b> <b>prices</b> increases the salience of price in decision making, making consumers more price-sensitive, which in turn activates a greater motivation to select cheaper products. Findings from three experiments show that this motivational effect persists even when <b>unit</b> <b>prices</b> offer little cognitive benefit, such as when product options have identical sizes. Results also show that the motivational effect of <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> operates independently of the cognitive effect, and that an individual's price consciousness moderates the motivational effect. The paper demonstrates that <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> increases consumer price sensitivity in the context of price discounts, extending the generalizability of the <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> effect. 13 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - This paper aims {{to first}} {{investigate}} how <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> affects consumers’ grocery purchase decisions {{and perceptions of}} the shopping task’s information load. The second goal is to test how time pressure enhances the behavioural and perceptual effects of displaying <b>unit</b> <b>prices.</b> Design/methodology/approach - Two on-line experiments were conducted using national samples of shoppers. In Study 1, participants indicated their choices and perceptions in an inter-brand shopping scenario where prepackaged products have conflicting positions on retail <b>price</b> and <b>unit</b> <b>price.</b> In Study 2, participants conducted the same shopping task but now under a condition of time pressure. Findings - Study 1 shows that <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> shifts consumer choices towards the lower <b>unit</b> <b>priced</b> options and improves their perceptions of task information load. Study 2 shows that when consumers are under time pressure, <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> shows stronger effects on choices but not on perceptions. Research limitations/implications - The study comprised a fairly homogenous set of low involvement categories and relatively small assortments in a hypothetical purchase setting. Exploration {{of the role of}} <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> in more complex and more realistic purchase environments pose suitable avenues for future research. Practical implicationsThis study shows that consumers benefit from <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> because it makes it easier for them to find the lower <b>unit</b> <b>priced</b> items and to more quickly complete their shopping task. Retailers will benefit from increased customer satisfaction and possibly an improved store image. Social implications - The study shows that consumers generally benefit from the presence of <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> and that <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> information does not create harmful effects in terms of increasing their information load. Originality/value - This study uses a specifically designed and controlled but nevertheless realistic grocery choice task to study the effects of <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> in an inter-brand context where there are only small differences in size and price. The study contributes to the literature by showing that in such conditions, <b>unit</b> <b>prices</b> help consumers compare the economic losses associated with product options. Their heuristic role is more pronounced when consumers are under time pressure. The study shows that consumers generally benefit from the presence of <b>unit</b> <b>prices.</b> 21 page(s...|$|R

5000|$|The {{benefits}} of <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> {{have been widely}} reported in the literature.

40|$|Economic theory makes three {{predictions}} about consumption and response output in a choice situation: (a) When plotted on logarithmic coordinates, total consumption (i. e., summed across concurrent sources of reinforcement) {{should be a}} positively decelerating function, and total response output should be a bitonic function of <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> increases; (b) total consumption and response output should {{be determined by the}} value of the <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> ratio, independent of its cost and benefit components; and (c) when a reinforcer is available at the same <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> across all sources of reinforcement, consumption should be equal between these sources. These predictions were assessed in human cigarette smokers who earned cigarette puffs in a two-choice situation at a range of <b>unit</b> <b>prices.</b> In some sessions, smokers chose between different amounts of puffs, both available at identical <b>unit</b> <b>prices.</b> Individual subjects' data supported the first two predictions but failed to support the third.

40|$|In {{behavioral}} economics, {{the ratio}} of response requirement to reinforcer magnitude {{is referred to as}} <b>unit</b> <b>price.</b> Previous research with nonhuman subjects has demonstrated that (a) comparable amounts of food are consumed at the same <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> even though different response requirements and reinforcer magnitudes comprise that <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> and (b) increases in <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> decrease food consumption in a positively decelerating fashion. The present study assessed the generality of these findings to the cigarette smoking of 5 human volunteers. During approximately 18 3 -hr sessions, various combinations of response requirement (fixed-ratio 200, 400, and 1, 600) and reinforcer magnitude (1, 2, and 4 puffs per bout) were arranged. Consumption (i. e., the number of puffs) generally was comparable at the same <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> independent of the response requirement and reinforcer magnitude comprising that <b>unit</b> <b>price.</b> In addition, increasing <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> generally decreased consumption in a positively decelerating fashion. These results extend the generality of the unit-price analysis to human cigarette smoking. Moreover, these results further support the position that reinforcer magnitude and response requirement are functionally equivalent and interact to determine consumption. The concept of <b>unit</b> <b>price,</b> by integrating and summarizing the effects of those two operations, provides a more parsimonious explanation of the results than do separate evaluations of the effects of response requirement and reinforcer magnitude...|$|R

40|$|<b>Unit</b> <b>price</b> {{contracting}} is {{a standard}} contracting method for transportation projects. In such contracts, State Department of Transportation (DOT) estimators prepare an Engineer’s estimate of construction cost, {{which is used to}} compare the bids received and select the winning bid. This Engineer’s estimate is mostly dependent on historical bid data available from projects completed by the DOT in the past and experience of an estimator. The estimators adjust the <b>unit</b> <b>prices</b> of construction cost items to reflect project characteristics such as size, quantity of material, location etc. The historical data available to estimators contain <b>unit</b> <b>prices</b> of major construction cost items for some geographic locations where projects have been recently completed. However, the location of an upcoming project is highly likely to be different from any locations of recently completed projects. Hence, the estimator must use <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> data of different project locations to estimate <b>unit</b> <b>prices</b> for an upcoming project at a new location. The reliability of such estimate is questionable since there is no clearly defined procedure or methodology or technique that the estimators may use to adjust <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> for new locations. Geospatial interpolation is a promising method for quantifying the <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> for new locations from known values at various locations. The platform of geographic information systems (GIS) has tools for powerful spatial interpolation using techniques like inverse distance weighting (IDW), kriging, spline, natural neighbor, etc. In this study, the <b>unit</b> <b>prices</b> of five major highway construction pay items from the locational bid data obtained from Iowa Department of Transportation are visualized in GIS environment and spatially interpolated across the geographical map of Iowa using IDW. The difference in estimated and interpolated values of input points gives the error in interpolation and the average error is used to compare the interpolation techniques. Various factors are employed in the techniques to improve the resulting interpolation surface. Lower average error signifies the interpolation surface is better for that particular cost item. The geo-statistical interpolation methods have an interactive layer, which can be used to obtain a <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> at any location by just clicking on that location.
