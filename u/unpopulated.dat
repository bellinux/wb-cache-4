5|$|On 23 March 1992 an F-16A {{lost power}} at 5,500meters {{altitude}} (18,000ft). The pilot survived after aiming the aircraft at an <b>unpopulated</b> area and ejecting {{at an altitude}} of 1,400meters (4,500ft).|$|E
5|$|Because Exmoor was a royal forest, i.e. {{a hunting}} reserve, it was <b>unpopulated</b> in Medieval times. The first {{house on the}} moor was only built at Simonsbath in 1654. It {{was not until the}} 19th century that farms were built around the moor.|$|E
5|$|As far as Westmoreland was concerned, however, all {{he needed}} to know was that the NVA had massed large numbers of troops for a set-piece battle. Making the {{prospect}} even more enticing was that the base was in an <b>unpopulated</b> area where American firepower could be fully employed without civilian casualties. The opportunity to engage and destroy a formerly elusive enemy that was moving toward a fixed position promised a victory of unprecedented proportions.|$|E
5|$|At one time, one {{hurricane}} researcher {{identified a}} tropical storm over Cuba in late August, {{although there was no}} evidence the storm actually existed. There was also a report of a hurricane over Louisiana on October22, although it is unknown if it was related to other storms in the season. There may have been additional unconfirmed tropical cyclones during the season. Meteorologist Christopher Landsea estimates up to six storms were missed from the official database, due to small tropical cyclone size, sparse ship reports, and relatively <b>unpopulated</b> coastlines.|$|E
5|$|During Shadow of the Colossus, {{the player}} {{receives}} little {{information concerning the}} backstories of the characters and their relationships with one another. The game {{takes place in a}} fantasy setting, with most of the game's events occurring within a vast and <b>unpopulated</b> peninsula, known as the Forbidden Land, separated from the outside world by a mountain range to its north and sea to the south and east. The presence of ruins and other ancient structures indicate the area was once a settlement.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Ileana never {{significantly}} impacted land, and no {{tropical cyclone}} warnings or watches for the storm. While near peak intensity, it passed 60mi (100km) {{south of the}} <b>unpopulated</b> Socorro Island; a station on the island recorded sustained winds of 59mph (95km/h), with gusts to 77mph (125km/h). The hurricane dropped heavy rainfall along the Mexican coastline, causing flooding in Nayarit, Jalisco, Colima, Michoacán, and Baja California Sur. High surf from Ileana reached the coast, killing one man near Cabo San Lucas despite warnings not to swim in the ocean.|$|E
5|$|In 1965 Hornchurch Urban District was {{abolished}} and {{its former}} area was transferred from Essex to Greater London, {{to be combined}} {{with that of the}} Municipal Borough of Romford in order to form the present-day London Borough of Havering. In 1993 the Greater London boundary, to the east of Cranham and north of the railway line, was locally realigned to the M25 motorway, returning some mostly <b>unpopulated</b> areas of open land to Essex and leaving North Ockendon as the only part of Greater London outside the bounds of the motorway.|$|E
5|$|Safety and {{security}} required a remote, isolated and <b>unpopulated</b> area. The scientists also wanted a flat area to minimize secondary {{effects of the}} blast, and with little wind to spread radioactive fallout. Eight candidate sites were considered: the Tularosa Valley; the Jornada del Muerto Valley; the area southwest of Cuba, New Mexico, and north of Thoreau; and the lava flats of the El Malpais National Monument, all in New Mexico; the San Luis Valley near the Great Sand Dunes National Monument in Colorado; the Desert Training Area and San Nicolas Island in Southern California; and the sand bars of Padre Island, Texas.|$|E
5|$|The 1868 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was among the}} quietest on record, with only four tropical cyclones recorded. Only three seasons had fewer storms than in 1868, and seven had {{the same number of}} storms. Initially, there were no known storms during the season, although a re-analysis confirmed the activity. All tropical activity occurred within a 45‑day span. There may have been other unconfirmed tropical cyclones during the season. Meteorologist Christopher Landsea estimates up to six storms were missed from the official database, due to small tropical cyclone size, sparse ship reports, and relatively <b>unpopulated</b> coastlines.|$|E
5|$|The 1869 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season was the earliest {{season in the}} Atlantic hurricane database in which {{there were at least}} ten tropical cyclones. Initially there were only three known storms in the year, but additional research uncovered the additional storms. Meteorologist Christopher Landsea estimates up to six storms may remain missing from the official database for each season in this era, due to small tropical cyclone size, sparse ship reports, and relatively <b>unpopulated</b> coastlines. All activity occurred in a three-month period between the middle of August and early October.|$|E
5|$|VT149 heads southeastward {{away from}} the built up village of Granville into a more rural region of the Rutland County town of Pawlet, {{paralleling}} the Mettawee River as it progresses onward. It heads past homes and through a dense forest as it intersects with Bull Frog Hollow Road just after the border. After Bull Frog Hollow Road, the route proceeds eastward through an area dominated by quarries. VT149 continues on, entering a more open area and passing only a few homes before ending at an intersection with VT30 in Blossom Corners, a small, largely <b>unpopulated</b> community within the town of Pawlet.|$|E
5|$|A {{detailed}} {{proposal was}} presented by Oslo Sporveier in August 1996. It {{became clear that}} Berg would not be served by the Ring Line. Many neighbours to {{the route of the}} Sognsvann Line complained about this proposal, stating that they had hoped that the section from Majorstuen to Berg would have been rebuilt as a tunnel. They also argued that it was irrational that the line was running at-grade in densely populated areas, while it would run in a tunnel through the then mostly <b>unpopulated</b> Nydalen. To compensate, Oslo Sporveier stated that they would build noise screens along the line. Also, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration protested to the plans, and stated that funding should be allocated to upgrading Ring 3 to six lanes before public transport investments were made in the area.|$|E
5|$|Although {{situated}} in an <b>unpopulated</b> area, Wotton station was relatively well used. It saw the highest passenger numbers of any {{station on the}} line other than the terminus at Brill railway station and the junction with the main line to London at Quainton Road railway station, and it also carried large quantities of milk from the area's dairy farms. In 1906 the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway (commonly known as the Alternative Route) was opened, crossing the Brill Tramway at Wotton. Although the lines were not connected, a station (also named Wotton) {{was built on the}} new line very near the existing Wotton station; the two stations shared a stationmaster.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{presence}} of vegetation, the earth does not yet contain human or animal life, indicating that the scene represents {{the events of the}} biblical Third Day. Bosch renders the plant life in an unusual fashion, using uniformly gray tints which make it difficult to determine whether the subjects are purely vegetable or perhaps include some mineral formations. Surrounding the interior of the globe is the sea, partially illuminated by beams of light shining through clouds. The exterior wings have a clear position within the sequential narrative of the work as a whole. They show an <b>unpopulated</b> earth composed solely of rock and plants, contrasting sharply with the inner central panel which contains a paradise teeming with lustful humanity.|$|E
5|$|Due to the unanticipated {{relocation}} of Arlene, only one tropical cyclone watch or warninga tropical storm warning for coastal areas from Brownsville to Matagorda on June19was ever {{issued by the}} NHC {{in association with the}} cyclone. Issued 21hours before landfall, the warning was discontinued after the system moved inland. Prior to the warning, Arlene had satisfied the criterion for a tropical storm watch as a developing tropical depression. However, the NHC and various National Weather Service forecast offices opted to delay the watch {{as a result of the}} poorly organized appearance of the cyclone at the time. Given the weak nature of Arlene and the relatively <b>unpopulated</b> extent of coast which it impacted, evacuations were minimal – only fifteen fled from summer homes along Magnolia Beach and Indianola, Texas due to the threat of flooding.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} the GPK was authorised, {{controversy}} raged about the route a railway to England might take. It was plain that Carlisle would be reached from the south; a direct route from Glasgow over the Southern Uplands, the route that {{became known as the}} Annandale line, would involve severe gradients, and pass through almost <b>unpopulated</b> territory. The locomotives available at the time were not thought to be capable of climbing the steep inclines, and rope haulage was put forward by some as the solution. By contrast, a route from Kilmarnock through Cumnock and Dumfries—the Nithsdale line—would have much easier gradients and pass through considerable population centres, bringing in additional traffic. Moreover, the Nithsdale route would be much cheaper to build.|$|E
5|$|Sandgrouse {{have little}} {{interaction}} with people, primarily because most species live in arid <b>unpopulated</b> areas and at low densities. They are not generally sought after as game birds {{as they are}} not especially palatable, although they have on occasion been taken in great numbers at water holes. An attempt to introduce them into Nevada failed {{but they have been}} introduced to Hawaii. No species is considered to be threatened although there have been some localised range contractions, particularly in Europe. A subspecies of the chestnut-bellied sandgrouse, P. e. floweri, was last seen in the Nile Valley of Egypt in 1979. It is thought to be extinct, but the reasons for this are unknown.|$|E
5|$|The People's Army of Vietnam {{had been}} {{utilizing}} {{large sections of}} relatively <b>unpopulated</b> eastern Cambodia as sanctuaries into which they could withdraw from the struggle in South Vietnam to rest and reorganize without being attacked. These base areas were also utilized by the Vietnamese communists to store weapons and other material that had been transported {{on a large scale}} into the region on the Sihanouk Trail. PAVN forces had begun moving through Cambodian territory as early as 1963. In 1966, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, ruler of Cambodia, convinced of eventual communist victory in Southeast Asia and fearful for the future of his rule, had concluded an agreement with the People's Republic of China which allowed the establishment of permanent communist bases on Cambodian soil {{and the use of the}} Cambodian port of Sihanoukville for resupply.|$|E
5|$|The first United States stockade named Fort Lauderdale {{was built}} in 1838, and {{subsequently}} was a site of fighting during the Second Seminole War. The fort was abandoned in 1842, {{after the end of}} the war, and the area remained virtually <b>unpopulated</b> until the 1890s. It was not until Frank Stranahan arrived in the area in 1893 to operate a ferry across the New River, and the Florida East Coast Railroad's completion of a route through the area in 1896, that any organized development began. The city was incorporated in 1911, and in 1915 was designated the county seat of newly formed Broward County.|$|E
5|$|Within {{their limited}} jurisdictions, {{municipalities}} are autonomous, responsible and accountable to their citizens, to the province and their future {{residents in the}} case for the <b>unpopulated</b> Jumbo Glacier Mountain Resort Municipality. Their powers and responsibilities are regulated through the Local Government Act of British Columbia, the Community Charter, and, in the case of Vancouver, the Vancouver Charter. They have the power of a natural person, the power to expropriate, and the power to establish and enforce bylaws. They are able to raise funds through property taxes and user fees, and borrow a limited amount through the Municipal Finance Authority of British Columbia to pay for capital costs.|$|E
5|$|Across eastern Mexico, {{the heavy}} {{rainfall}} caused mudslides and floods, which {{damaged or destroyed}} 90,000houses, and damaged or destroyed about 3,088,000acres (1,250,000hectares) of crop fields; thousands of livestock were also killed. The floods affected 819 Municipalities of Mexico in 17states and the federal district, leaving about 500,000people homeless, of whom half were in Tabasco and Veracruz states. Several ports were closed due to the floods. Although power lines were downed, most electrical systems were not damaged, and power was quickly restored within a week in most areas. A total of 39rivers overflowed, which washed away bridges, roads, dams, and some entire houses, and {{there were thousands of}} landslides, mostly in <b>unpopulated</b> areas. Collectively, 28federal highways and 300rural roads were closed or damaged. The federal highway network sustained damage in 1,237locations as a result of 1,164landslides or mudslides and 28damaged bridges. Damage was estimated at $451.3million (4.3billion pesos).|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Oslo Sporveier {{presented}} {{plans to}} connect the Sognsvann Line to the Grorud Line with a new Ring Line. The company also considered building the ring {{as part of the}} tramway, and have combined operation with both tram and metro on the Sognsvann Line. This was later discarded, despite the higher investment costs with a metro, since the tramway would give higher operating costs and longer travel time. A detailed suggestion was presented by Oslo Sporveier in August 1996. It became clear that Berg would not be served by the Ring Line. Many neighbors to the Sognsvann Line complained about the proposal, stating that they had hoped that the section from Majorstuen to Berg would have been rebuilt as a tunnel. They also argued that it was irrational that the line was running at-grade in densely populated areas, while it would run in a tunnel through the then mostly <b>unpopulated</b> Nydalen.

5|$|In the {{economic}} fields, he {{was influenced by}} the principles of physiocracy, an economic doctrine that considered that nature was the source of wealth. As a result, much of his works and reform proposals at the Consulate were oriented towards improving agriculture, livestock, manufacturing, and free trade. He maintained a fluent contact with the consulates of other cities, developing a view of the viceroyalty as a whole. This led to an increased work in cartography of the largely <b>unpopulated</b> areas of the territory; the maps designed during this period would later prove a great help for José de San Martín during the Crossing of the Andes. He introduced new crops, and promoted the use of local fauna for livestock production. He protected the weaving industry by increasing the production of cotton in Cochabamba, as he considered the local crop to be of similar quality to the cotton from Europe.|$|E
5|$|The Guam National Weather Service office {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm watch for the Marshall Islands shortly after Pongsona developed into {{a tropical storm}}, and a day later watches were issued for Chuuk. On December 5, the service issued tropical storm warnings for parts of the Federated States of Micronesia. As Pongsona became a typhoon, the Guam National Weather Service office issued a typhoon watch for Guam, Rota, Saipan, and Tinian, which was upgraded to a typhoon warning about 23hours prior to the onset of tropical storm-force winds; typhoon warnings were also issued for the <b>unpopulated</b> island of Agrihan. By one day before the typhoon moved through the Mariana Islands, JTWC predicted Pongsona to pass well east of the area. Despite a more westward track than anticipated, forecasts remained stagnant until the morning of December 8, when forecasters reluctantly predicted much greater threat to the Mariana Islands. As a result, many citizens felt they were unprepared and insufficiently warned for the typhoon.|$|E
5|$|The entire park {{is within}} the {{jurisdiction}} of the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming, making it the only federal court district that includes portions of more than one state (Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming). Law professor Brian C. Kalt has argued that it may be impossible to impanel a jury in compliance with the Vicinage Clause of the Sixth Amendment for a crime committed solely in the <b>unpopulated</b> Idaho portion of the park (and that {{it would be difficult to}} do so for a crime committed solely in the lightly populated Montana portion). One defendant, who was accused of a wildlife-related crime in the Montana portion of the park, attempted to raise this argument but eventually pleaded guilty, with the plea deal including his specific agreement not to raise the issue in his appeal.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the hurricane's track, it posed {{little to}} no threat to any major landmasses or {{populated}} islands. During Celia's early development stages, it brought moderate rainfall to parts of Oaxaca and Guerrero; however, no loss of life or structural damage was reported. Beaches in both states {{increased the number of}} lifeguards on duty since the threat of rip currents would remain high for several days. On June22, the Sistema Nacional de Protección Civil (National System of Civil Protection) in the Mexican state of Jalisco raised the alert level to stage two for coastal areas. People were urged to be cautious about venturing out into coastal waters as the storm produced rough seas near the coast. The alert was later expanded upon to include coastal areas of Michoacán and Colima. Although out of the storm's projected path, a precautionary alert was issued for Socorro Island. However, between June22 and 23, the outer bands of the storm brought unsettled weather to France's Clipperton Island. Since this island is <b>unpopulated,</b> the NHC did not issue any warnings for it.|$|E
