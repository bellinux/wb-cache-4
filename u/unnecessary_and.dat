5|$|In 1801 while {{aboard the}} 74-gun HMS Ganges (commanded by Captain Thomas Fremantle, a {{personal}} friend), Brock {{was present at}} the Battle of Copenhagen. His troops were supposed to lead an assault on the forts at Copenhagen. The outcome of the sea battle made such an assault <b>unnecessary,</b> <b>and</b> Brock was able to observe first-hand the tactical brilliance of Lord Nelson. After the battle, Fremantle and Brock celebrated the victory with Nelson. In 1802 Brock and the 49th Foot were ordered to Canada.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} in the 1980 referendum, {{in an attempt to}} build a broad coalition, had sought only the authority to negotiate sovereignty with the Canadian government, and promised a second referendum to ratify the results of any negotiation. Parizeau believed a second referendum was <b>unnecessary</b> <b>and</b> would only encourage the remainder of Canada to use delaying tactics. The draft initial Act featured a question only asking for the authority to declare Quebec sovereign.|$|E
5|$|Works on {{the main}} route were largely {{complete}} by the Autumn of 1906, and {{after a period of}} test running the railway was ready to open in December 1906. As a result of the electrification and resignalling of the DR's surface and sub-surface tracks in 1905, the capacity of the existing route was sufficiently increased that the construction of deep-level tunnels east of South Kensington was <b>unnecessary,</b> <b>and</b> the powers were allowed to lapse.|$|E

5|$|Although {{built and}} {{initially}} operated as two separate stations {{by the two}} companies, the C and the CCE platforms were sufficiently close together that a deep level interchange was constructed between the passages of the two stations with a small ticket office for passengers changing between the lines. Another passage led to lifts that surfaced within the main line station itself. With the entrance within the main line station able to serve both sets of platforms satisfactorily, the separate station buildings were considered <b>unnecessary,</b> <b>and</b> they both closed on 30 September 1914. The CCE building remains (converted for use as an electrical substation), but the C's building was demolished in 1934 to enable the construction of Euston House for the London, Midland and Scottish Railway.|$|E
5|$|Annalee Call was {{originally}} written for Angelina Jolie; although Jolie auditioned, she {{turned down the}} role and Winona Ryder was cast in December 1996. Call had a generally negative critical reception, largely due to a perceived lack of synergy with the film and the franchise. Roger Ebert praised Ryder's acting, but felt {{that she did not}} bring a strong presence or purpose to the film except as a familiar face to younger viewers. Nordling agreed in a 2012 Ain't It Cool News analysis, saying that Call's synthetic origin is <b>unnecessary</b> <b>and</b> her only role is that of a surrogate audience.|$|E
5|$|By {{the start}} of the 20th century, {{developments}} in guns and armour had made most of the Device Forts that remained in service too small to be useful. Modern weapons systems and their supporting logistics facilities such as munitions stores could not fit within the 16th-century designs. A 1905 review of the Falmouth defences concluded that the naval artillery at St Mawes had become superfluous, as the necessary guns could be mounted at combination of Pendennis and newer sites along the coast, and the castle was disarmed. A review in 1913 concluded that keeping naval artillery at Calshot was also <b>unnecessary,</b> <b>and</b> the site was turned into an experimental seaplane station instead.|$|E

5|$|In Tan Liang Joo John, Justice Judith Prakash {{stated that}} this was not a closed list, and that the court is {{entitled}} to take into account all the circumstances of the case which in its view go towards showing bad faith. She also noted that English authorities impose another limit on the content of criticism – that the acts or words in question must neither impute improper motives to nor impugn the integrity, propriety and impartiality of judges or the courts. However, she declined to follow these authorities and averred that to impose such a limit would be <b>unnecessary</b> <b>and</b> potentially over-restrictive of legitimate criticism.|$|E
5|$|On November 20, 1789, New Jersey {{ratified}} {{eleven of}} the twelve amendments, rejecting Article II, which regulated Congressional pay raises. On December 19 and 22, respectively, Maryland and North Carolina ratified all twelve amendments. On January 19, 25, and 28, 1790, respectively, South Carolina, New Hampshire, and Delaware ratified the Bill, though New Hampshire rejected the amendment on Congressional pay raises, and Delaware rejected Article I, which regulated {{the size of the}} House. This brought the total of ratifying states to six of the required ten, but the process stalled in other states: Connecticut and Georgia found a Bill of Rights <b>unnecessary</b> <b>and</b> so refused to ratify, while Massachusetts ratified most of the amendments, but failed to send official notice to the Secretary of State that it had done so.|$|E
5|$|One major anomaly {{remained}} in the railway's operations: the 1889 Regulation of Railways Act had required, amongst other measures, that all British passenger trains be fitted with continuous brakes. McConnel had secured an exemption for the Talyllyn Railway, {{on the basis that}} the low speed of operation meant they were <b>unnecessary</b> <b>and</b> that the cost of compliance would bankrupt the enterprise, {{but by the end of}} the 1990s the Railway Inspectorate was insisting that the Talyllyn be brought into compliance with the act, a little over 100years after it had passed. By 2001, the railway had fitted its entire passenger fleet with the necessary equipment, operated by air brake pumps mounted on the locomotives.|$|E

5|$|Rumination {{syndrome}} is diagnosed {{based on a}} complete history of the individual. Costly and invasive studies such as gastroduodenal manometry and esophageal Ph testing are <b>unnecessary</b> <b>and</b> will often aid in misdiagnosis. Based on typical observed features, several criteria have been suggested for diagnosing rumination syndrome. The primary symptom, the regurgitation of recently ingested food, must be consistent, occurring for at least sixweeks of the past twelve months. The regurgitation must begin within 30minutes of {{the completion of a}} meal. Patients may either chew the regurgitated matter or expel it. The symptoms must stop within 90minutes, or when the regurgitated matter becomes acidic. The symptoms must not be the result of a mechanical obstruction, and should not respond to the standard treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease.|$|E
5|$|This {{operation}} proved <b>unnecessary,</b> <b>and</b> Morgan's {{two divisions}} {{were sent to}} North Africa, while he was directed to plan the invasion of Sardinia. In time this was abandoned in favour of the Allied invasion of Sicily. I Corps headquarters remained in the United Kingdom the whole time, located at 1 Cumberland near Marble Arch, with the headquarters mess in the Lyons Marble Arch Corner House. However, it gained considerable experience in operational planning. Morgan was appointed a Commander of the Order of the Bath on 2 June 1943.|$|E
5|$|While {{defended by}} those {{cultures}} {{in which it}} constitutes a tradition, FGC is opposed by many medical and cultural organizations {{on the grounds that}} it is <b>unnecessary</b> <b>and</b> harmful. Short term health effects may include hemorrhage, infection, sepsis, and even result in death, while long term effects include dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, vaginitis and cystitis. In addition FGC leads to complications with pregnancy, labor and delivery. Reversal (defibulation) by skilled personnel may be required to open the scarred tissue. Amongst those opposing the practice are local grassroots groups, and national and international organisations including WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA and Amnesty International. Legislative efforts to ban FGC have rarely been successful and the preferred approach is education and empowerment and the provision of information about the adverse health effects as well the human rights aspects.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 1950s, Braathens SAFE {{started looking for}} a {{replacement}} for the aging DC-3s and Herons. An order was placed with Fokker for the delivery of their new Fokker F-27 Friendship, a two-engine turboprop with cabin pressurization. Braathens SAFE was the second airline to receive the plane, after Aer Lingus. The first craft, LN-SUN, was delivered in December 1958, with the second, LN-SUO, delivered the following year. They were put into service on the main routes: once daily Oslo–Trondheim, once daily Oslo–Ålesund, twice daily Oslo–Stavanger, including one stopping at Kristiansand, and one trip daily Bergen–Ålesund–Trondheim. The delivery of the Friendships made the Herons <b>unnecessary,</b> <b>and</b> these were sold. The two DC-3s were kept as a reserve, and {{were used for the}} first part of the summer schedules because of late delivery of LN-SUO. They were also used for charter. The airports at Hamar, Farsund and Tønsberg had too short runways for the Friendship, and these destinations were terminated.|$|E
5|$|Grand Teton National Park is {{the only}} U.S. National Park that permits hunting, but only of elk {{in an effort to}} keep the populations of that species regulated. This {{provision}} was included in the legislation that combined Jackson Hole National Monument and Grand Teton National Park in 1950. While some National Parks in Alaska permit subsistence hunting by indigenous natives and a few other National Park Service managed areas allow hunting under highly regulated circumstances, hunting in U.S. National Parks is not generally allowed. In Grand Teton National Park, hunters are required to obtain Wyoming hunting licenses and be deputized as park rangers. Hunting is restricted to areas east of the Snake River and north of Moran, Wyoming, the hunt is permitted only east of U.S. Route 89. Proponents of continuing the elk hunt, which occurs in the fall, argue that the elk herd would become overpopulated without it, leading to vegetation degradation from overgrazing elk herds. Opponents cite that there has been an increase of predators such as the wolf and grizzly bear in Grand Teton National Park, rendering the annual hunt <b>unnecessary</b> <b>and</b> exposing hunters to attacks by grizzly bears as they become accustomed to feeding on remains left behind from the hunt.|$|E
5|$|In 1856, while Tchaikovsky {{was still}} at the School of Jurisprudence and Anton Rubinstein lobbied aristocrats to form the RMS, critic Vladimir Stasov and an 18-year-old pianist, Mily Balakirev, met and agreed upon a {{nationalist}} agenda for Russian music, one that would take the operas of Mikhail Glinka as a model and incorporate elements from folk music, reject traditional Western practices and use exotic harmonic devices such as the whole tone and octatonic scales. They saw Western-style conservatories as <b>unnecessary</b> <b>and</b> antipathetic to fostering native talent. Eventually, Balakirev, César Cui, Modest Mussorgsky, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and Alexander Borodin {{became known as the}} moguchaya kuchka, translated into English as the Mighty Handful or The Five. Rubinstein criticized their emphasis on amateur efforts in musical composition; Balakirev and later Mussorgsky attacked Rubinstein for his musical conservatism and his belief in professional music training. Tchaikovsky and his fellow conservatory students were caught in the middle.|$|E

5|$|In 1982, Waters {{suggested}} a new musical project with the working title Spare Bricks, originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall. With {{the onset of}} the Falklands War, Waters changed direction and began writing new material. He saw Margaret Thatcher's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and <b>unnecessary,</b> <b>and</b> dedicated the album to his late father. Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall. Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire. Michael Kamen, a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall, mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright. The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions.|$|E
5|$|In late 1944, the Australian Government {{committed}} twelve Australian Army brigades {{to replace}} six US Army divisions which were conducting defensive roles in Bougainville, New Britain and the Aitape-Wewak area in New Guinea. While the US units had largely conducted a static defence of their positions, their Australian replacements mounted offensive operations designed {{to destroy the}} remaining Japanese forces in these areas. The value of these campaigns was controversial {{at the time and}} remains so to this day. The Australian Government authorised these operations for primarily political reasons. It was believed that keeping the Army involved in the war would give Australia greater influence in any post-war peace conferences and that liberating Australian territories would enhance Australia's influence in its region. Critics of these campaigns argue that they were <b>unnecessary</b> <b>and</b> wasteful of the lives of the Australian soldiers involved as the Japanese forces were already isolated and ineffective.|$|E
