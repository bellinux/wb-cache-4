5|$|The Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006 {{provides}} for Ofcom to issue licences to radio broadcasters {{for the use}} of stations and wireless telegraphy apparatus. The Act sets out a number of criminal offences relating to wireless telegraphy, including the establishment or use of a wireless telegraphy station or apparatus for the purpose of making an <b>unlicensed</b> broadcast. The financing or participating in the day-to-day running of <b>unlicensed</b> broadcasting is also a criminal offence, as is the supplying of a sound recording for an <b>unlicensed</b> station and advertising through <b>unlicensed</b> stations. The Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006 allows Ofcom to take a number of actions against individuals committing these offences, including power of entry and search and seizure of equipment. It is a criminal offence to obstruct a person exercising enforcement powers on Ofcom's behalf. Furthermore, the Broadcasting Act 1990 provides that anyone convicted of an unlawful broadcasting offence is disqualified from holding a broadcasting licence for five years.|$|E
5|$|An {{investigation}} {{under the}} PRC State Council was announced on 16 November, {{the day after}} the fire, to determine the cause of the blaze. A preliminary finding by investigators concluded that sparks from welding work being done on the building, undertaken by <b>unlicensed</b> welders, ignited scaffolding around the structure, which led to the apartments' destruction. The municipal government also placed the blame on illegal multi-layered subcontracting, and detained four managers from several construction companies. In all, sixteen individuals have been arrested in connection to the fire, as well as four others accused of being <b>unlicensed</b> welders.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} into the fire made a preliminary conclusion that negligence by <b>unlicensed</b> welders on the tenth floor caused the bamboo scaffolding and attached nylon netting to catch fire, which subsequently spread to the entire structure. Shanghai authorities detained eight individuals on 16 November, at least four of whom were accused of being <b>unlicensed</b> welders. As of 19 November, a total of twelve individuals were being held by officials in connection to the blaze, including four more who were detained that day. The four were representatives of Jiayi Building Decoration, a part of renovation contractor Jing'an Construction, Shanghai Jing'an Construction Supervision, and the apartment management company.|$|E
5|$|Chicago {{defensive}} tackle Tank Johnson {{was required to}} request a judge's order to leave the state of Illinois due to an arrest for <b>unlicensed</b> ownership of six firearms and two assault rifles. On January 23, 2007, the judge granted him permission to travel out of state {{to play in the}} Super Bowl.|$|E
5|$|During the 1940s, the Metropolitan Police {{attempted}} {{to crack down}} on illegal gambling held in social clubs along Whitechapel Road. The Brancroft Social Club was based at No.69, and in March 1944, a police raid uncovered <b>unlicensed</b> horse and dog race betting which led to the arrest of the club's owner and 21 patrons.|$|E
5|$|Fewer deck {{officers}} are employed on bulkers than on similarly sized ships of other types. A mini-bulker carries {{two to three}} deck officers, while larger Handysize and Capesize bulkers carry four. Liquid natural gas tankers {{of the same size}} have an additional deck officer and <b>unlicensed</b> mariner.|$|E
5|$|In early 2014, {{as part of}} an {{incentive}} to close <b>unlicensed</b> buildings in the regency, police posted notification that the Kampoeng Rawa site was <b>unlicensed.</b> The manager of Kampoeng Rawa, Agus Sumarno, stated that they had tried to gain permission for their buildings, but both the provincial and regional governments had stated that they were unable to issue it. When the police banner later disappeared, there were reports that the site's management had taken it down, although the management stated that it had fallen under a hard wind. The head of the Semarang Regency Council, Bambang Kusriyanto, stated that he had confirmed Kampoeng Rawa's management had applied for permission and called for the government to process the request expediently. In February 2015, President Joko Widodo called for the issuance of permits to be expedited, citing the site's potential to promote social empowerment.|$|E
5|$|Its {{circulation}} reached several thousand, {{with the}} highest estimates of about 10,000 issues, and copies of it were found from Moscow and Istanbul to Madrid and the United States. With <b>unlicensed</b> copies and shared subscriptions its circulation might have even been several times higher, reaching at the highest estimates close to 100,000.|$|E
5|$|The 1967 Marine Broadcasting Offences Act officially outlawed {{offshore}} stations, but <b>unlicensed</b> radio continued, {{moving from}} ships and sea-based platforms to urban {{areas in the}} latter part of the 1960s (they were already illegal under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1949). During this period, home-made medium wave (and sometimes short wave) transmitters were often constructed inside cheap, expendable biscuit tins.|$|E
5|$|The Mayfair Chapel {{was based}} on Curzon Street. It became a popular place for illegal marriages, {{including}} over 700 in 1742, and was where James Hamilton, 6th Duke of Hamilton married Elizabeth Gunning in 1752. The Marriage Act 1753 stopped the practice of <b>unlicensed</b> marriages. The chapel was demolished in 1899.|$|E
5|$|Two network {{employees}} had been {{questioned by the}} network over the matter, but both denied distributing any copies of the series. <b>Unlicensed</b> DVDs containing the first nine episodes of Underbelly were seized in a raid by police on a business in Melbourne's western suburbs on 11 March 2008. The 41-year-old man arrested faced charges of copyright infringement and of breaking the court order banning broadcast {{of the program in}} Victoria. Along with the Underbelly DVDs, more than 7000 other <b>unlicensed</b> DVDs were uncovered, as well as eight printers and 70 new DVD burners. The group of ingringers contained several members, some of whom had been arrested for offences in the months prior.|$|E
5|$|After a local theatre {{performance}} of Romeo and Juliet, the {{actors in the}} lead roles, suspected of engaging in an affair, are murdered by a cloaked figure. Angel suspects foul play, but everyone else passes it off as an accident. When Angel is called to resolve a neighborhood dispute, he discovers a stash of <b>unlicensed</b> firearms and an old naval mine in an elderly man's shed. Angel confiscates the stash in the police department's evidence room.|$|E
5|$|Bootlegs {{should not}} be {{confused}} with counterfeit or <b>unlicensed</b> recordings, which are merely unauthorised duplicates of officially released recordings, often attempting to resemble the official product as close as possible. Some record companies have considered that any record issued outside of their control, and for which they do not receive payment, to be a counterfeit, which includes bootlegs. However, some bootleggers are keen to stress that the markets for bootleg and counterfeit recordings are different, and a typical consumer for a bootleg will have bought most or all of that artist's official releases anyway.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, under {{pressure}} from Chinese authorities, the Vietnamese government tried two Falun Gong practitioners who had been operating a shortwave radio station and broadcasting information into China. The pair was charged with <b>unlicensed</b> broadcasting, and sentenced to 2 and 3 years in prison. Earlier in the same year, another radio station operated by Falun Gong practitioners in Indonesia, Radio Erabaru, was shuttered under diplomatic pressure from China.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to judicial affairs, Chesney worked to ensure {{good relations with}} his cathedral chapter, and allowed them exemptions from episcopal jurisdiction. He also permitted the clergy of his diocese to remit the payment of chrism money and forwent the traditional annual payment from the archdeacons of the diocese to the bishop. He suppressed <b>unlicensed</b> schools in Huntingdon and employed a number of educated clerks; his acta almost always include one witness entitled magister, and often as many as six.|$|E
5|$|Licensed and <b>unlicensed</b> {{variants}} of Sega consoles {{have been produced}} by third-party companies. In Brazil, Tectoy created and released the Master System 3 Compact, which may function wirelessly with an RF transmitter. An SKU of this console targeted at female gamers, the Master System Girl, was molded in bright pink plastic. A more recent version, released in 2006 in Brazil as the Master System 3 Collection, contains 120 built-in games. Another Master System variant, built as a handheld game console, was released by Coleco in North America in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Micro Machines was {{developed}} because Galoob wanted Codemasters {{to develop a}} game based on their toy brand, although Galoob and Codemasters encountered legal issues with Nintendo over the game being <b>unlicensed.</b> Micro Machines was ported to several systems, and received remakes for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, and GameCube in 2002. Micro Machiness reception was positive, with reviewers praising the originality and two-player mode, although some criticised the sprites on some versions. A sequel, , was released in 1994, and the series was revived in 2016 {{with the release of}} a title for iOS and Android.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft {{reported}} that their security teams and law enforcement were investigating the possibility of Halo 4 content being leaked on the internet in October 2012. Jessica Shea, Community Manager at 343 Industries, warned fans {{to be wary of}} Halo 4 spoilers that were posted on the internet. O'Connor stated at New York Comic Con that leaks of the game and footage would not have any impact on how the game is released or marketed and that <b>unlicensed</b> uploading of high-profile games is inevitable.|$|E
5|$|Motte was a London {{publisher}} {{who took}} over Benjamin Tooke's publishing business, which printed many of Swift's earlier works. In 1726, Swift sent Motte a copy of Gulliver's Travels to be printed anonymously. Motte took great care to protect {{the identity of the}} author, and employed five publishing houses to speed production of the book and avoid <b>unlicensed</b> copying. In 1727, Motte formed his first direct contract with Swift in order to publish Swift's Miscellanies. As part of the contract, Motte paid Tooke for the original copyright to the work.|$|E
5|$|Spider-Man 3 was commercially {{released}} in sixteen territories on May 1, 2007. The film was {{released in}} Japan on May 1, 2007, three days prior to the American commercial release, to coincide with Japan's Golden Week. Spider-Man 3 was also released in China on May 3, 2007 to circumvent market growth of <b>unlicensed</b> copies of the film. The studio's release of a film in China before its domestic release was a first for Sony Pictures Releasing International. By May 6, 2007, Spider-Man 3 opened in 107 countries around the world.|$|E
5|$|The Flames uniform {{received}} mixed reviews. Detractors {{compared the}} uniform to the outfit Ronald McDonald wears. They proved popular with fans, however; the league revealed {{a few days}} before the game that 16,000 Flames jerseys had been sold, compared to about 6,000 Montreal jerseys. Cheaper, <b>unlicensed</b> copies were widely available online and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police worked to stem the sale of counterfeit merchandise that was misrepresented as being authentic.|$|E
5|$|The Tupolev Tu-85 (USAF/DoD {{reporting}} name 'Type 31', NATO reporting name Barge) was a Soviet prototype {{strategic bomber}} {{based on the}} Tu-4, an <b>unlicensed</b> reverse engineered copy of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress. It was the ultimate development of the B-29 family, being over 50% heavier than its ancestor and had nearly double the range. Only two prototypes were built before the program was canceled {{in favor of the}} Tupolev Tu-95 bomber which was much faster and had the same range.|$|E
5|$|The five {{aircraft}} {{modified by}} the factory {{were given the}} Klimov RD-45 engine, the Soviet <b>unlicensed</b> copy of the Nene engine, and all six aircraft were used by the VVS for aircrew familiarization and training. The aircraft completed were later relegated to test duties. One aircraft was used for drone tests and another, redesignated as the Tu-12LL, mounted various pulse jet engines on a pylon above the fuselage.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} may not detain an individual even momentarily without reasonable and articulable suspicion, {{with a few}} exceptions. In Delaware v. Prouse (1979), the Court ruled an officer has made an illegal seizure when he stops an automobile and detains the driver in order to check his driver's license and the registration of the automobile, unless the officer has articulable and reasonable suspicion that a motorist is <b>unlicensed</b> or that an automobile is not registered, or either the vehicle or an occupant is otherwise subject to seizure for violation of law.|$|E
5|$|Theophilus, {{through his}} father, {{applied to the}} Lord Chamberlain during the summer asking {{to have a new}} license issued, but he was refused. Following this, he applied to Charles Lee, the Master of the Revels, and {{received}} a license to perform theatrical shows in return for payment even though the license had no legal authority. This brought about criticism against Lee in the Daily Post dated 29 September 1733 over issuing the licence and called it just a ploy by the actors. On 30 October, the management of the Theatre Royal sent a letter to veteran actor John Mills and other rebels threatening further legal action regarding their <b>unlicensed</b> theatre. After Theophilus responded with a claim that he was acting within the law, the management and John Rich, manager of the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, demanded the courts to shut down the <b>unlicensed</b> theatres. A 5 November hearing set a date for a trial, but the case fell apart before it was ever heard over the technical wording of a law that conflicted with the original request by the licensed theatre managers.|$|E
5|$|This is an {{alphabetical}} list of released {{games for}} the Genesis. Titles listed do not include releases for the Sega CD and Sega 32X add-ons. Included in this list are titles not licensed by Sega, including releases in Taiwan by several developers such as Gamtec, as well as releases by Accolade before being licensed following the events of Sega v. Accolade. This list also includes titles developed by <b>unlicensed</b> third-party developers after the discontinuation of the Genesis, such as Pier Solar and the Great Architects.|$|E
5|$|UK pirate radio, <b>unlicensed</b> illegal broadcasting, {{was popular}} in the 1960s and {{experienced}} another surge {{of interest in the}} 1980s. There are currently an estimated 150 pirate radio stations in the UK. A large proportion of these pirate radio stations operate in London, with significant clusters in Harlesden and the wider London Borough of Brent, Crystal Palace, Stoke Newington, the London Borough of Southwark, the London Borough of Tower Hamlets and London Borough of Lambeth.|$|E
5|$|A 1983 {{industry}} crash, {{caused by}} the market being overrun with low-quality products, prompted {{a higher degree of}} regulation by future console manufacturers: when the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) was launched in the United States in 1985, Nintendo of America instituted requirements and restrictions on third-party developers, including the requirement for all games to be licensed by the company. The console itself also included a lockout chip to enforce this requirement and prevent the console from loading <b>unlicensed</b> games. Such leverage on developers has since become a standard practice among console makers, although Nintendo of America also had stringent content policies, frequently censoring blood, sexual content, and references to religion, tobacco and alcohol from games released on its consoles in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Aalborg had a synagogue, {{built in}} 1854; and the Jewish rabbi Salomon Mielziner served it for 35 years. Services {{were no longer}} offered after Mielziner died, and in 1924 the synagogue was donated to the city government, which began using it to store the city {{archives}} (Stadsarkivet). It was burned down by the Schalburg Corps in April 1945 {{towards the end of}} World War II, destroying its centuries-old Torahs. Anti-semitism continues to exist in Denmark, and in 1999, an <b>unlicensed</b> Nazi radio station began operating from a neo-Nazi stronghold in Fynen, Nørresundby, within Aalborg municipality. The activity has been widely denounced with organized opposition in Aalborg and the rest of Denmark, and in February 1999, 12 anti-fascists were arrested for possession of explosives at their base in Fynen.|$|E
5|$|Although this {{decision}} was a boon to the Stationers, it was short-lived. Following Millar, the right to print The Seasons was sold to a coalition of publishers including Thomas Becket. Two Scottish printers, Alexander and John Donaldson, began publishing an <b>unlicensed</b> edition, and Becket successfully obtained an injunction to stop them. This decision was appealed in Donaldson v Beckett, and eventually went to the House of Lords. After consulting with the judges of the King's Bench, Common Pleas and Exchequer of Pleas, the Lords concluded that copyright was not perpetual, and that the term permitted by the Statute of Anne was the maximum length of legal protection for publishers and authors alike.|$|E
5|$|As of 2012, 57% {{of women}} of childbearing age want to avoid {{pregnancy}} (867 of 1520million). About 222 million women however were not able to access birth control, 53million of whom were in sub-Saharan Africa and 97million of whom were in Asia. This results in 54million unplanned pregnancies and nearly 80,000 maternal deaths a year. Part of the reason that many women are without birth control is that many countries limit access due to religious or political reasons, while another contributor is poverty. Due to restrictive abortion laws in Sub-Saharan Africa, many women turn to <b>unlicensed</b> abortion providers for unintended pregnancy, resulting in about 2–4% obtaining unsafe abortions each year.|$|E
5|$|Dow {{spent the}} early 1840s {{attending}} to his tanning business, but also {{found time to}} encourage individual drinkers to take up abstinence. In 1842, he and his allies succeeded in getting the city government in Portland to require licenses for liquor dealers and to prosecute <b>unlicensed</b> sellers; {{a referendum on the}} question was decided in the prohibitionists' favor later that year. The next year saw the Democrats win election to city government, replacing the more prohibition-friendly Whigs, and many liquor-sellers resumed their trade as prosecutions were deferred indefinitely. Dow kept up his speaking efforts around the state, despite once being assaulted by a man hired by a liquor dealer.|$|E
5|$|Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard is {{a poem by}} Thomas Gray, {{completed}} in 1750 and first published in 1751. The poem’s origins are unknown, but it was partly inspired by Gray’s thoughts {{following the death of}} the poet Richard West in 1742. Originally titled Stanzas Wrote in a Country Church-Yard, the poem was completed when Gray was living near St Giles' parish church at Stoke Poges. It was sent to his friend Horace Walpole, who popularised the poem among London literary circles. Gray was eventually forced to publish the work on 15 February 1751, to pre-empt a magazine publisher from printing an <b>unlicensed</b> copy of the poem.|$|E
5|$|For <b>unlicensed</b> mariners, 2009 {{statistics}} from the American Bureau of Labor Statistics give median earnings for able and ordinary seamen as US$35,810, varying from $21,640 (at the 10th percentile) to $55,360 (at the 90th percentile). This can be compared with 2006 {{statistics from}} the International Labour Organization, giving average yearly earnings for Filipino and Chinese able seamen around $2,000 to $3,000 per year (PHP9,900 per month and CNY3,071 per year). Among licensed mariners, American chief engineers earned a median $63,630, varying from $35,030 to $109,310 while their Filipino counterparts averaged $5,500 per year (PHP21,342 per month).|$|E
5|$|Prior to his arrest, Chandler {{worked as}} an <b>unlicensed</b> aluminum-siding contractor. He testified in his own defense, {{against the advice of}} his attorneys, saying that he had met the Ohio women and had given them directions, but that he never saw them again aside from in {{newspaper}} coverage and on the billboards set up by authorities. Police originally theorized that two men were involved in the murders, but this was discounted once Chandler was arrested. Following his conviction, Chandler was incarcerated at Union Correctional Institution, and, during his seventeen years of incarceration until his execution, he was notable for not having had a single visitor.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{noted the}} quality and craft {{that went into the}} compilation's design. Jaz Rignall (USgamer) was {{impressed}} by the compilation's presentation and balance between frills and efficiency, and Dan Whitehead (Eurogamer) felt that the theatrical theme fit Rare's character. Reviewers considered Rare Replay a high-water mark for video game compilations—Kotaku called it the best since Valve's The Orange Box. On the other hand, Jeremy Parish (USgamer) found the contemporaneous Mega Man Legacy Collection Criterion Collection-style presentation to be a more authentic appreciation of its original material. Chris Plante (The Verge) saw Rare Replay slight hardware improvements and added touches as a viable model for putting retrogames back on the market and slowing the tide of <b>unlicensed</b> downloads.|$|E
