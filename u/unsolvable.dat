5|$|Approximations {{using the}} first few terms of a Taylor series can make {{otherwise}} <b>unsolvable</b> problems possible for a restricted domain; this approach is often used in physics.|$|E
5|$|Some {{philosophers}} take an epistemic {{approach and}} argue that the mind–body problem is currently <b>unsolvable,</b> and perhaps will always remain <b>unsolvable</b> to human beings. This is usually termed New mysterianism. Colin McGinn holds {{that human beings are}} cognitively closed in regards to their own minds. According to McGinn human minds lack the concept-forming procedures to fully grasp how mental properties such as consciousness arise from their causal basis. An example would be how an elephant is cognitively closed in regards to particle physics.|$|E
5|$|The {{relation}} of two fields is {{expressed by the}} notion of a field extension. Galois theory, initiated by Evariste Galois in the 1830s, is devoted to understanding the symmetries of field extensions. Among other results, this theory shows that angle trisection and squaring the circle can not be done with a compass and straightedge. Moreover, it shows that quintic equations are algebraically <b>unsolvable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Though many {{remained}} unimpressed, Oppenheimer appointed Neddermeyer {{the head}} of a new group to test implosion. His group became the E-5 (Implosion) Group, which was part of Captain William S. Parsons' E Division. A gun-type nuclear weapon was the preferred method, but implosion research constituted a backup. Neddermeyer embarked on an intensive series of experiments testing cylindrical implosions. The result was a series of distorted shapes. Progress was made; Neddermeyer and a member of his team, Hugh Bradner, along with James L. Tuck from the British Mission, conceived the idea of explosive lenses, in which shaped charges are used to focus the force of an explosion. Nevertheless, seemingly <b>unsolvable</b> problems with shock wave uniformity brought progress on implosion to a crawl.|$|E
5|$|In {{computational}} complexity theory, 2-satisfiability {{provides an}} example of an NL-complete problem, one that can be solved non-deterministically using a logarithmic amount of storage and that is among the hardest of the problems solvable in this resource bound. The set of all solutions to a 2-satisfiability instance can be given the structure of a median graph, but counting these solutions is #P-complete and therefore not expected to have a polynomial-time solution. Random instances undergo a sharp phase transition from solvable to <b>unsolvable</b> instances as the ratio of constraints to variables increases past 1, a phenomenon conjectured but unproven for more complicated forms of the satisfiability problem. A computationally difficult variation of 2-satisfiability, finding a truth assignment that maximizes the number of satisfied constraints, has an approximation algorithm whose optimality depends on the unique games conjecture, and another difficult variation, finding a satisfying assignment minimizing the number of true variables, is an important test case for parameterized complexity.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{discover}} a wrecked Borg scout ship {{with a single}} survivor: a young Borg drone. Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) insists on treating the surviving Borg despite the concerns of Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart). On Picard's orders, the drone is confined and monitored by security forces at all times and is prevented from contacting the Borg Collective. Chief Engineer Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) and Lt. Commander Data assist Crusher in bringing the Borg back to health. As they {{come to understand the}} workings of the Borg, La Forge and Data postulate an idea of using the Borg drone as a weapon of mass destruction. By implanting an <b>unsolvable</b> geometric formula into his mind and returning him back to the Collective, the formula should rapidly spread (similar to a computer virus) and disable the Borg. Crusher is aghast at this suggestion, considering it equivalent to genocide, while Picard and the other senior crew deliberate on the ethics of this plan.|$|E
25|$|The word {{problem was}} one of the first {{examples}} of an <b>unsolvable</b> problem to be found not in mathematical logic or the theory of algorithms, but in one of the central branches of classical mathematics, algebra. As a result of its unsolvability, several other problems in combinatorial group theory have been shown to be <b>unsolvable</b> as well.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} subfield of recursion theory studies algorithmic unsolvability; {{a decision}} problem or function problem is algorithmically <b>unsolvable</b> {{if there is}} no possible computable algorithm that returns the correct answer for all legal inputs to the problem. The first results about unsolvability, obtained independently by Church and Turing in 1936, showed that the Entscheidungsproblem is algorithmically <b>unsolvable.</b> Turing proved this by establishing the unsolvability of the halting problem, a result with far-ranging implications in both recursion theory and computer science.|$|E

25|$|Confederate {{soldiers}} were also faced with inadequate food rations, {{especially as the}} war progressed. There was plenty of meat in the Confederacy.

Union victory at Vicksburg in 1863 shut off supplies from Texas and the west.|$|E
25|$|The Dutch {{government}} had previously asked Turkish ministers {{to refrain from}} campaigning in the country, fearing that divisive campaign rhetoric would sow divisions within the Turkish community. Prime Minister Mark Rutte claimed that negotiations with the Turkish government to allow a small scale speech by the minister were still ongoing, when Çavuşoğlu publicly threatened with sanctions should ministers be prevented from campaigning. It was these threats that made the situation <b>unsolvable</b> to the Dutch government.|$|E

25|$|But the use {{of stable}} models in answer set {{programming}} {{provides a different perspective}} on such programs. In that programming paradigm, a given search problem is represented by a logic program so that the stable models of the program correspond to solutions. Then programs with many stable models correspond to problems with many solutions, and programs without stable models correspond to <b>unsolvable</b> problems. For instance, the eight queens puzzle has 92 solutions; to solve it using answer set programming, we encode it by a logic program with 92 stable models. From this point of view, logic programs with exactly one stable model are rather special in answer set programming, like polynomials with exactly one root in algebra.|$|E
25|$|Julia Robinson and Yuri Matiyasevich {{showed that}} every Diophantine set has {{dimension}} no greater than 13. Later, Matiyasevich sharpened their methods {{to show that}} 9 unknowns suffice. Although {{it may well be}} that this result is not the best possible, there has been no further progress. So, in particular, there is no algorithm for testing Diophantine equations with 9 or fewer unknowns for solvability in natural numbers. For the case of rational integer solutions (as Hilbert had originally posed it), the 4 squares trick shows that there is no algorithm for equations with no more than 36 unknowns. But Zhi Wei Sun showed that the problem for integers is <b>unsolvable</b> even for equations with no more than 11 unknowns.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to realize that the word problem is in fact solvable for many groups G. For example, polycyclic groups have solvable word problems since the normal form of an arbitrary word in a polycyclic presentation is readily computable; other algorithms for groups may, in suitable circumstances, also solve the word problem, see the Todd–Coxeter algorithm and the Knuth–Bendix completion algorithm. On the other hand the fact that a particular algorithm does not solve the word problem for a particular group does not show that the group has an <b>unsolvable</b> word problem. For instance Dehn's algorithm does not solve the word problem for the fundamental group of the torus. However this group is the direct product of two infinite cyclic groups and so has a solvable word problem.|$|E
25|$|His main asset is his {{practical}} application {{of scientific knowledge}} and inventive use of common items. The clever solutions MacGyver implemented to seemingly <b>unsolvable</b> problemsoften in life-or-death situations requiring him to improvise complex devices {{in a matter of}} minuteswere a major attraction of the show, which was praised for generating interest in the applied sciences, particularly engineering, and for providing entertaining storylines. All of MacGyver's exploits on the show were ostensibly vetted by consulting scientists for the show's writers to ensure a basis on scientific principles (even though, the creators acknowledged, in real life one would have to be extraordinarily lucky for most of MacGyver's ideas to succeed). In the few cases where MacGyver used household chemicals to mix up poisons, explosives or other items deemed too dangerous to be accurately described to the public, details were altered or left vague or an essential component or step was omitted.|$|E
25|$|One of the theorems proved by Ramsey in his 1928 paper On {{a problem}} of formal logic now bears his name (Ramsey's theorem). While this theorem is the work Ramsey is {{probably}} best remembered for, he only proved it in passing, as a minor lemma {{along the way to}} his true goal in the paper, solving a special case of the decision problem for first-order logic, namely the decidability of what is now called the Bernays–Schönfinkel–Ramsey class of first-order logic, as well as a characterisation of the spectrum of sentences in this fragment of logic. Alonzo Church would go on to show that the general case of the decision problem for first-order logic is <b>unsolvable</b> (see Church's theorem). A great amount of later work in mathematics was fruitfully developed out of the ostensibly minor lemma, {{which turned out to be}} an important early result in combinatorics, supporting the idea that within some sufficiently large systems, however disordered, there must be some order. So fruitful, in fact, was Ramsey's theorem that today there is an entire branch of mathematics, known as Ramsey theory, which is dedicated to studying similar results.|$|E
25|$|Croteam used {{an array}} of {{automated}} and in-place tools to help rapidly design, debug, and test the game for playability. In one aspect, they recognized {{in the development of}} a puzzle game was that while puzzles could be designed with specific solutions, the process of creating the video game around the puzzle could create <b>unsolvable</b> situations or unforeseen shortcuts. To address this, they used a bot, developed by Croteam member Nathan Brown who had previously developed bots for other games including the ones incorporated into ports of Serious Sam 3 for consoles. The bot, named Bot, would watch the playthrough of a puzzle by a human player in terms of broad actions such as placing boxes on a switch for the completion of a puzzle. Then, as the puzzle's environment was tuned and decorated, they would have Bot attempt to solve the puzzle, testing to make sure it did not run into any dead-ends. If it did encounter any, Bot reported these through an in-house bug reporting system and then used game cheats to move on and finish out testing, which took between 30 and 60 minutes for the full game. As such, they were able to quickly iterate and resolve such problems when new features were introduced to the game. Overall, Croteam estimates they logged about 15,000 hours with Bot before the release of the public test version, and expect to use similar techniques in future games. They also used human playtesters to validate other more aesthetic factors of the games prior to the title's release.|$|E

500|$|A more {{moderate}} conception has been expounded by Thomas Nagel, {{which holds that}} the mind body problem is currently <b>unsolvable</b> at the present stage of scientific development and that {{it might take a}} future scientific paradigm shift or revolution to bridge the explanatory gap.

500|$|Distinguishing {{between science}} and non-science is {{referred}} to as the demarcation problem. For example, should psychoanalysis be considered science?

[...] However, no unified account of the problem has won acceptance among philosophers, and some regard the problem as <b>unsolvable</b> or uninteresting.

500|$|Srinivasa Ramanujan [...] ( [...] , 22 December 188726 April 1920) was an Indian {{mathematician}} {{who lived}} during the British Rule in India. Though {{he had almost}} no formal training in pure mathematics, [...] he made substantial contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions, including solutions to mathematical problems considered to be <b>unsolvable.</b> Ramanujan initially developed his own mathematical research in isolation; it was quickly recognized by Indian mathematicians. Seeking mathematicians who could better understand his work, in 1913 he began a postal partnership with the English mathematician G. H. Hardy at the University of Cambridge, England. Recognizing the extraordinary work sent to him as samples, Hardy arranged travel for Ramanujan to Cambridge. In his notes, Ramanujan had produced groundbreaking new theorems, including some that Hardy stated had 'defeated [...] completely', in addition to rediscovering recently proven but highly advanced results.|$|E
500|$|Introspectively, {{the world}} of {{conscious}} experience seems to have considerable structure. [...] Immanuel Kant asserted that {{the world as we}} perceive it is organized according to a set of fundamental [...] "intuitions", which include object (we perceive the world as a set of distinct things); shape; quality (color, warmth, etc.); space (distance, direction, and location); and time. Some of these constructs, such as space and time, correspond to the way the world is structured by the laws of physics; for others the correspondence is not as clear. Understanding the physical basis of qualities, such as redness or pain, has been particularly challenging. David Chalmers has called this the hard problem of consciousness. Some philosophers have argued that it is intrinsically <b>unsolvable,</b> because qualities ("qualia") are ineffable; that is, they are [...] "raw feels", incapable of being analyzed into component processes. Other psychologists and neuroscientists reject these arguments. For example, research on ideasthesia shows that qualia are organised into a semantic-like network. Nevertheless, {{it is clear that the}} relationship between a physical entity such as light and a perceptual quality such as color is extraordinarily complex and indirect, as demonstrated by a variety of optical illusions such as neon color spreading.|$|E
