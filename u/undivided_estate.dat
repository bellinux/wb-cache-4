Hillhouse built a wide road, now Hillhouse Avenue, to extend {{to the foot of}} the hill, but planned to use the ridge itself for his own residence, and called the tract [...] "Temple Square." [...] Hillhouse bequeathed the land to his son, James Abraham Hillhouse, who erected a family estate known as Sachem's Wood, a name derived from Hillhouse's supposedly Native American facial features. Hillhouse commissioned a secluded mansion, known by the same name and designed by Ithiel Town at the present-day site of Kline Biology Tower. After Sachem's Wood was completed in 1828, surrounding lots were developed into revivalist mansions, but the large Hillhouse tract remained an <b>undivided</b> <b>estate.</b>|$|E

50|$|Monasteries in {{this area}} were {{historically}} founded mainly by kings, bishops and nobles. There {{were a number of}} reasons individuals might found a monastery, largely self-serving ones: to reserve a burial there, which came with perpetual prayers by the monks on behalf of the founder's soul, sheltering a princess, widow, unmarried or bastard, in the case of kings. Sometimes there were political reasons for founding or protection of a particular monastery; many of the religious houses who protected were located in border areas where battles often raged, such as Castile and León or Navarre, as was the case Matallana monastery (in the Valladolid), or Bujedo-Navarre. Bishops had an interest in building a monastery on which to exercise their authority, especially in the feudal period, as this guaranteed an income. The nobility desired salvation for themselves and his family, plus a demonstration of political influence through sponsoring one of these great works. The monastic vows (poverty, chastity and obedience) were considered an appropriate vocation for younger sons, regardless of the sincerity or otherwise of his vocation, {{in order to reduce the}} likelihood of disputes over the inheritance of the firstborn, who would then hold <b>undivided</b> <b>estates</b> according to the institution of primogeniture. This close identification between the clergy and nobility, both privileged classes, survived as an enduring connection during the Middle Ages and the Modern Age to the end of the ancien regime.|$|R

When he sought a {{partition}} of this Estate his brother, Raja Randhir Singh opted to keep the <b>Estate</b> <b>undivided</b> and, instead, chose to compensate Bikrama Singh. A settled amount was deposited into a Trust which was used to procure a fresh Estate for Bikrama Singh. The lands finally vested in Bikrama Singh in the districts of Sitapur and Rae Bareli in the United Provinces (present day Uttar Pradesh) were formalized by the central government through the Bikrama Singh Estates Act 1883 (an unrepealed Act of the Government of India).|$|R
