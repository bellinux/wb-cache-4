5|$|After the British had withdrawn, the Germans reoccupied {{the battery}} position. Steiner was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Sword from his command bunker, {{so even though}} he was able to get two of his guns back in action, he was unable to direct {{accurate}} fire onto the landings. However, observers with the 736th Infantry Regiment, holding out at La Brèche, were able to direct his guns until that position was neutralised.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Władysław {{gave the}} Russians the border town of Serpeysk and nearby territories, hoping {{to persuade the}} Tsar to join in an anti-Swedish alliance. However, the king was {{ultimately}} unable to overcome objections from the Polish-Lithuanian Sejm, who were unwilling to fight Sweden after the Treaty of Sztumska Wieś. The Russians, <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> benefit in such an alliance, were also unenthusiastic, and the proposed alliance came to nothing.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{intensely}} closeted {{nature of}} Miami's gay community at that time, many voters {{who were not}} swayed by Bryant's rhetoric were persuaded instead by her campaign's point that the law was unnecessary; they were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the problem of discrimination. Unlike blacks or Cubans, {{gay men and lesbians}} were able to find jobs, although they faced dismissal upon their supervisors learning of their sexual orientation. In order to see a complaint through, they would have to remain out, and many lived in constant fear of exposure. Since the advent of second wave feminism earlier in the decade, many lesbians in the U.S. were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> themselves as part of the same community with gay men. Accusations from Save Our Children were almost all directed at the behavior of men. As a result, much of the response by gay men was angry and many lesbians took issue with the misogynistic tone gay men used. However, with Bryant representing a common adversary, {{for the first time in}} years, gay men and lesbians united to work together on the campaign.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} and {{deciding}} game of the 1984 World Series against the San Diego Padres, Kuntz pinch-hit for designated hitter Johnny Grubb {{with the bases loaded}} and the score tied at three. Kuntz hit a pop-up to short right field that Tony Gwynn was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> Second baseman Alan Wiggins made the catch, but was unable to prevent Kirk Gibson from racing home from third with the go-ahead run. The Tigers maintained their lead after that, giving Kuntz an unlikely game-winning RBI.|$|E
5|$|Her cell was 6 × 12ft (1.8 x 3.6m) with no window, {{containing}} a bed, toilet and sink. The jail had 30 cells {{built in a}} U shape, and although detainees could talk to one another, they were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> each other. Her lawyer said the guards behaved professionally, and had not tried to harass or embarrass Manning. She was allowed to walk for up to one hour a day, meals were taken in the cell, and she was shackled during visits. There was access to television when it {{was placed in the}} corridor, and she was allowed to keep one magazine and one book. Because she was in pretrial detention, she received full pay.|$|E

50|$|Similar to Nazi Germany, the U.S.S.R. {{prepared}} {{its citizens}} for war by releasing dramas, such as Sergei Eisenstein's iconic Alexander Nevsky. The U.S.S.R also screened films depicting partisan {{activity and the}} suffering inflicted by the Nazis, such as Girl No. 217, which showed a Russian girl enslaved by an inhumane German family. Films were shown on propaganda trains while newsreels were screened in subway stations to reach those who were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> pay <b>to</b> <b>see</b> films in the theater.|$|R

5|$|More killings take place. Tilde, a {{beautiful}} lesbian journalist, is murdered {{at her home}} along with her lover Marion. Maria, the young daughter of Neal's landlord, is later hacked {{to death with a}} axe after discovering the killer's lair. Neal notices that TV interviewer Christiano Berti has an unusually intense interest in his work. That night, Neal and his Italian assistant Gianni watch Berti's house. Gianni approaches the house alone {{to get a better view}} and sees an assailant hack Berti to death with an axe. However, Gianni is <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the murderer's face.

5|$|The upper tier is {{contoured}} {{to leave}} open {{space in the}} corners of the ground, and the roof is significantly canted inwards. Both of these features are meant to provide as much airflow and sunlight to the pitch as possible. The stadium gives an illusion that supporters in the upper tier {{on one side of the}} ground are <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> supporters in the upper tier opposite. As part of a deal with Sony, the stadium was the first in the world to incorporate HDTV streaming. In the north-west and south-east corners of the stadium are two giant screens suspended from the roof.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in October of each year, Pleione {{along with}} the rest of the cluster can be seen rising in the east in the early morning before dawn. To see it after sunset, one will need to wait until December. By mid-February, the star is visible to {{virtually}} every inhabited region of the globe, with only those south of 66° <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it. Even in cities like Cape Town, South Africa, at the tip of the African continent, the star rises almost 32° above the horizon. Due to its declination of roughly +24°, Pleione is circumpolar in the northern hemisphere at latitudes greater than 66° North. Once late April arrives, the cluster can be spotted briefly in the deepening twilight of the western horizon, soon to disappear with the other setting stars.|$|E

50|$|In The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, {{a player}} can enchant {{multiple}} objects with {{a percentage of}} invisibility which creates 100% invisibility when worn. When combined with 100% stealth, this renders the player completely <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> be <b>seen</b> or heard by enemies. Enchanted invisibility is distinctly different from chameleon which only allows limited camouflage.|$|R

5|$|Delay issues aside, the {{development}} team encountered further {{challenges in the}} creation of the game. Implementing the top-down perspective became a particular issue and resulted in a lot of trial and error. With a true top-down view, players would be <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> characters' faces and bodies. To circumvent this issue, objects in the world were tilted at an angle so that they were more visible in the top-down view. Mouri requested that the game run at sixty frames per second instead of thirty to stabilise the stereoscopic 3D and smoothen movement animations. While doubling the frame rate increased the processing load, it allowed the developers to implement a feature where players could select items by dragging and dropping them from their inventory using the Nintendo 3DS's touchscreen and stylus; at thirty frames per second this feature felt too sluggish for the stylus's movement.|$|E
5|$|The {{session was}} {{disrupted}} when Nakajima {{drove into the}} back-end of Jarvis's car heading into Les Combes corner. Nakajima was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Jarvis because of heavy spray reducing visibility on the Kemmel straight. Nakajima complained of severe back pain and was transported to Verviers hospital where a check-up found he had fractured vertebra. He was deemed unfit {{to take part in}} the race. Toyota's test and reserve driver Kamui Kobayashi was in Japan and unavailable, so the No. 1 car ran as a two-driver operation for the remainder of the event weekend. It missed the second practice session because it required monocoque rebuilding. The No. 8 Audi also missed the second practice session because it was undergoing rear-end repairs.|$|E
5|$|Though {{attending}} Christian Sunday services, Mandela studied Islam. He {{also studied}} Afrikaans, hoping {{to build a}} mutual respect with the warders and convert them to his cause. Various official visitors met with Mandela, most significantly the liberal parliamentary representative Helen Suzman of the Progressive Party, who championed Mandela's cause outside of prison. In September 1970, he met British Labour Party politician Dennis Healey. South African Minister of Justice Jimmy Kruger visited in December 1974, but he and Mandela did not get along with each other. His mother visited in 1968, dying shortly after, and his firstborn son Thembi {{died in a car}} accident the following year; Mandela was forbidden from attending either funeral. His wife was rarely able to see him, being regularly imprisoned for political activity, and his daughters first visited in December 1975. Winnie was released from prison in 1977 but was forcibly settled in Brandfort and remained <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him.|$|E

5|$|While the Marathas were {{fighting}} the Mughals {{in the early}} 18th century, the British held small trading posts in Mumbai, Madras and Calcutta. The British fortified the naval post of Mumbai after they saw the Marathas defeat the Portuguese at neighbouring Vasai in May 1739. In {{an effort to keep}} the Marathas out of Mumbai, the British sent envoys to negotiate a treaty. The envoys were successful, and a treaty was signed on 12 July 1739 that gave the British East India Company rights to free trade in Maratha territory. In the south, the Nizam of Hyderabad had enlisted the support of the French for his war against the Marathas. In reaction to this, the Peshwa requested support from the British, but was refused. <b>Unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the rising power of the British, the Peshwa set a precedent by seeking their help to solve internal Maratha conflicts. Despite the lack of support, the Marathas managed to defeat the Nizam over a period of five years.|$|E
5|$|Fossorial creatures live in {{subterranean}} environments. Many fossorial mammals {{were classified}} under the, now obsolete, order Insectivora, such as shrews, hedgehogs and moles. Fossorial mammals have a fusiform body, thickest at {{the shoulders and}} tapering off at the tail and nose. <b>Unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> in the dark burrows, most have degenerated eyes, but degeneration varies between species; pocket gophers, for example, are only semi-fossorial and have very small yet functional eyes, in the fully fossorial marsupial mole the eyes are degenerated and useless, talpa moles have vestigial eyes and the cape golden mole has a layer of skin covering the eyes. External ears flaps are also very small or absent. Truly fossorial mammals have short, stout legs as strength {{is more important than}} speed to a burrowing mammal, but semi-fossorial mammals have cursorial legs. The front paws are broad and have strong claws to help in loosening dirt while excavating burrows, and the back paws have webbing, as well as claws, which aids in throwing loosened dirt backwards. Most have large incisors to prevent dirt from flying into their mouth.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, the {{railroad}} was {{brought before the}} New Jersey Board of Public Utility Commissioners due to an accident on November 28, 1916, at Kingsland station. Passenger train No. 582, a special train for employees of the Canadian Car Company, had near stopped at Kingsland station. The train never left at any defined time, although averaged around 6:30 in the evening. However, around 6:30that evening, Train No. 479 came in twelve minutes late at {{a high rate of}} speed, and as a result could not slow down fast enough to avoid hitting passengers. At that time, the station had no inter-track fencing to prevent crossing of both Boonton Branch tracks, and because of this, people could board trains from either platform. That day the engineer of Train No. 479 was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the platform or the special train, and {{due to the lack of}} signals, had no information until the train knowing anything until the train left the west portal of Kingsland Tunnel. However, signals were set for west-bound trains if problems were to occur. After the accident, the Board requested the Lackawanna to install a westbound signal to prevent further accidents, while the Canadian Car Company moved its boarding to the company's rail siding.|$|E

5|$|In mid-1944, Raw was {{transferred}} to Egypt and undertook an operational conversion course that prepared him to fly Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bombers in combat. In July that year he was posted to No. 178 Squadron RAF, a British B-24 Liberator unit based near Foggia in southern Italy. While serving with this squadron, Raw took part in operations in the eastern Mediterranean region as well as Hungary, Romania and Yugoslavia. During August 1944 the long-range bomber units controlled by No. 205 Group RAF, including No. 178 Squadron, undertook several risky operations {{as part of the}} Warsaw airlift to supply the Polish Home Army during the Warsaw Uprising. Raw participated in three of these flights. His bomber was the only aircraft to deliver its cargo to Warsaw during a mission on 16August; Raw subsequently received the Polish Cross of Valour in February 1945 for this achievement. One of his other flights to Warsaw was conducted on 1September, but due to bad weather Raw was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the city at the time he dropped the load of supplies.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 30 May, Howe sent a signal to all his captains asking if they {{considered}} their ships ready for combat. All but Caesar replied in the affirmative and Howe pushed his ships after the retreating French. Despite holding the weather gage, Howe's pursuit was soon hampered by descending fog, and <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> or {{come to grips with}} the enemy throughout the whole day, the admiral feared he may have lost his opportunity for battle. However, by 31 May the fog had cleared and the French were still within sight to the north. To the surprise of the British, none of the 26 battleships in the French fleet appeared to show battle damage, whereas many of the British ships were nursing damaged rigging and battered hulls. Villaret had made use of the fog to reorganise his force, losing Montagnard and the frigate Seine to the convoy but gaining the independently sailing battleship Trente-un-Mai and Nielly's squadron of Sans Pareil, Trajan, and Téméraire. Villaret had also dispatched the battered Indomptable for home, escorted by an undamaged French ship.|$|E
5|$|They {{are taken}} {{to the home of}} the queen, which lies near the ruins of the lost city of Kôr, a once mighty {{civilisation}} that predated the Egyptians. The queen and her retinue live under a dormant volcano in a series of catacombs built as tombs for the people of Kôr. There, Holly is presented to the queen, a white sorceress named Ayesha. Her beauty is so great that it enchants any man who beholds it. She, who is veiled and lies behind a partition, warns Holly that the power of her splendour arouses both desire and fear, but he is dubious. When she shows herself, however, Holly is enraptured and prostrates himself before her. Ayesha reveals that she has learned the secret of immortality and that she possesses other supernatural powers including the ability to read the minds of others, a form of telegnosis and the ability to heal wounds and cure illness; she is also revealed to have a tremendous knowledge of chemistry, but is notably <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> into the future. She tells Holly that she has lived in the realm of Kôr for more than two millennia, awaiting the reincarnated return of her lover, Kallikrates (whom she had slain in a fit of jealous rage). Later, when Holly inadvertently and secretly discovers Ayesha in her hidden chamber, he learns that she may have some degree of power to reanimate the dead.|$|E
