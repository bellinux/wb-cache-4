The issue of <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> safety has been investigated through the matter element analysis theory. The chief aim of the present work is to investigate the features of <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> safety. Emphasis {{was placed on the}} construction of a criterion function by which traffic safety achieved a hierarchical system of objectives to be evaluated. The matter element analysis theory was used to create the comprehensive appraisal model of <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> safety. The technique was used to employ a newly developed and versatile matter element analysis algorithm. The matter element matrix solves the uncertainty and incompatibility of the evaluated factors used to assess <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> safety.

40|$|<b>Urban</b> <b>road</b> {{infrastructure}} is daily burdened by heavy traffic volume. Pavement structure roughness observations are significantly more difficult in urban agglomerations than on roads in unpopulated areas. Roughness, expressed by IRI (International Roughness Index), directly affects {{the quality and}} safety of <b>road</b> <b>traffic.</b> Within {{the framework of the}} pavement management in relation to safety and the achievement of the best possible ride comfort, {{it is very important to}} foresee when a road should be reconstructed. The method for quality evaluations of safety and ride comfort on <b>urban</b> <b>roads</b> presented in this paper is based on vehicle vibrations measurements. In the article, measuring of vehicle vibrations was performed on the main <b>urban</b> <b>roads</b> in Zagreb (Croatia). Measurements covered roads with different pavement surface roughness.

40|$|Abstract: Comparing {{to daily}} urban {{commuting}} traffics, intercity traffics are very intermingled with different purposes. Each {{of them may}} have different price elasticity for toll. Therefore, observed traffic flows must be carefully dissolved into several types of traffics, and price elasticity must be captured. In order to grasp the response of <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> <b>traffics</b> to price change, disaggregate behavioral model have been considered as an effective analytical tool. But in case of heterogeneous intercity traffics, survey on sampled individuals {{is very difficult to}} design and consumes much time and money. Fortunately in Japan, automatically detected traffic data have been gathered at many points along expressways and highways. This research is intended to analyze the cross-sectional traffic count of Honshu-Shikoku bridges.

Consequently a large amount of effort is expended in attempts to address this problem, especially in the area of acoustic design of buildings.

Methods: The study was carried out on 16 professional male truck drivers aged 34 – 53 years.

40|$|<b>Urban</b> <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> {{congestion}} {{has been}} a constant problem both in UK and worldwide. Urban road transport authorities collect data from different sources. These data can be effectively utilised with an objective to minimize congestion and its impact. One of the ways for the same can be to find possible congestion in different routes beforehand and then plan accordingly either to reduce the effect or to avoid it entirely. So this project aims to make effective use of existing data to predict journey time for near future e. g. 15 / 30 / 60 minutes ahead for different routes within the <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> network.
