5|$|The fossa has {{the most}} {{widespread}} geographical range of the Malagasy carnivores, and is generally found in low numbers throughout the island in remaining tracts of forest, preferring pristine <b>undisturbed</b> <b>forest</b> habitat. It is also encountered in some degraded forests, but in lower numbers. Although the fossa is found in all known forest habitats throughout Madagascar, including the western, dry deciduous forests, the eastern rainforests, and the southern spiny forests, it is seen more frequently in humid than in dry forests. This may be because the reduced canopy in dry forests provides less shade, and also because the fossa seems to travel more easily in humid forests. It is absent from areas with the heaviest habitat disturbance and, like most of Madagascar's fauna, from the central high plateau of the country.|$|E

25|$|Forest {{type and}} quality change with {{increasing}} altitude. At 2000 meters the natural, <b>undisturbed</b> <b>forest</b> begins to be seen. Above 2500 meters dwarf conifers and rhododendrons predominate {{in the harsh}} “elfin forest”, so called because a lack of topsoil and nutrients means that fully mature trees grow to measure only a few meters in height. Higher still, only the hardiest of plant species are found. At over 3000 meters, Fan Si Pan's summit can only support dwarf bamboo.|$|E
25|$|These hills {{are almost}} {{completely}} covered with open jungle. Lack of water prevents {{the growth of}} large trees and the prevalent vegetation consists of Terminalia, Hardwickia and Pterocarpus. Agriculture is almost non existent apart from isolated patches near villages where subsistence farming is practiced. The Nallamala Forests are probably the largest stretch of <b>undisturbed</b> <b>forest</b> in South India apart from the Western Ghats and were particularly rich in game till the 1970s. A {{large part of the}} forest {{is a part of the}} Nagarjunsagar-Srisailam Tiger Reserve that has a viable tiger population. Leopard sightings too are not uncommon. Many of the adventures of the popular wildlife writer, Kenneth Anderson are set in these forests.|$|E
500|$|This species' prime {{habitat is}} spiny forest, {{a mix of}} sub-arid thorn-scrub and {{deciduous}} woodland that only receives on average [...] of water a year and is covered in sandy soil. The dominant plants in these spiny forests belong to the cactus-like family Didiereaceae (especially Didierea madagascariensis) and more tree-like family Euphorbiaceae (especially Euphorbia stenoclada). Baobab trees are also prevalent. It was formerly believed that the long-tailed ground roller preferred an <b>undisturbed</b> <b>forest</b> habitat, while tolerating small amounts of disturbance. Later studies have concluded that it actually prefers degraded habitat. Despite this, shade is necessary, and the species is not found in deforested habitat or on the shadeless dunes prevalent in its range.|$|E

500|$|The {{species was}} {{historically}} found in mature or old-growth forests in Puerto Rico at all elevations, and in holes, cliffs, and other diverse habitats at lower elevations. The species {{could be found}} at medium elevations in the Guajataca State Forest (until 1910) and the Rio Abajo State Forest (until the 1920s), and at high elevations in the Carite State Forest (until the 1930s). Accounts from the early 1900s describe the parrots traveling away from the Luquillo forest and the Sierra de Cayey towards the main island's coast to find food. At the same time, the species was extirpated from Puerto Rico's smaller islands—Culebra, Vieques and Mona—and became restricted to five locations: two in karst-limestone areas, two in high montane rainforests and one in mangrove forest {{at the foot of}} the El Yunque National Forest. One of these karst regions, located in the northwestern part of Puerto Rico, was identified as a haven for the species. In particular, a region named Valle de las Cotorras (Valley of the Parrots), located between San Sebastián and Morovis, was home to a sizable population. Some amazons survived in small pockets of degraded forest but these proved insufficient to support large colonies. Eventually their natural habitat was reduced to the Cordillera Central and <b>undisturbed</b> <b>forest</b> areas, and by 1940 they were only to be found in primary forest at the Luquillo Mountains in El Yunque National Forest. The species is currently found at elevations between [...] Since the species requires mature forests with open-cavity trees for reproduction, it does not occur in dwarf and secondary forests.|$|E

2500|$|People seldom find {{absolutely}} {{natural environments}} on Earth, and naturalness usually varies in a continuum, from [...] 100% natural in one extreme to 0% natural in the other. More precisely, we can consider the different aspects or components of an environment, {{and see that}} their degree of naturalness is not uniform.

40|$|Abstract The goal of {{this study}} is to analyze the floristic {{patterns}} and the structure of disturbed and <b>undisturbed</b> upland <b>forests,</b> in Permanent Preservation Areas (PPAs) along the Moju river, in the Brazilian state of Pará. Trees with a diameter equal to or larger than 10 cm at 1. 30 m from the ground (DBH) &# 8805; 10 cm were analyzed for the upper stratum. For the middle stratum, individuals with DBH between 4. 99 and 9. 99 cm were sampled. Forty-five families and 221 species were found in disturbed forests, and 43 families and 208 species in <b>undisturbed</b> <b>forests.</b> Floristic similarity was high between strata and between forest types, with values above 50 %. Similarity was highest between middle strata. The most species-abundant families in <b>undisturbed</b> <b>forests</b> were Fabaceae, Sapotaceae, Chrysobalanaceae and Myrtaceae; the species with the highest density there were Eschweilera grandiflora, Licania sclerophylla and Zygia cauliflora. In disturbed forests, the dominant families were Fabaceae, Sapotaceae, Lecythidaceae and Melastomataceae. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index was 3. 21 for <b>undisturbed</b> <b>forests</b> and 2. 85 for disturbed forests. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis did not group the forests by their floristic composition in both upper and middle strata. Overall, the PPA forests along the Moju river, even if disturbed, did not show major floristic changes but substantially change their structural characteristics...|$|R

Some scientists consider the red imported fire ant to be a [...] "disturbance specialist"; human disturbance to the environment may be a major factor behind the ants' impact (fire ants tend to favour disturbed areas). This is shown through one experiment, demonstrating that mowing and plowing in studied areas diminished the diversity and abundance of native ant species, whereas red imported fire ants found on <b>undisturbed</b> <b>forest</b> plots had only diminished a couple of species.|$|E

6000|$|He awoke betimes to {{find himself}} already in the mountains. Buckeye Mills was a straggling settlement, and Clarence prudently stopped any {{embarrassing}} inquiry from his friend by dropping off the wagon with his equipment as they entered it, and hurriedly saying [...] "Good-by" [...] from a crossroad through the woods. He had learned that the nearest mining camp was five miles away, and its direction was indicated by a long wooden [...] "flume," [...] or water-way, that alternately appeared and disappeared on the flank of the mountain opposite. The cooler and drier air, the grateful shadow of pine and bay, and the spicy balsamic odors that everywhere greeted him, thrilled and exhilarated him. The trail plunging sometimes into an <b>undisturbed</b> <b>forest,</b> he started the birds before him like a flight of arrows through its dim recesses; at times he hung breathlessly over the blue depths of canyons where the same forests were repeated a thousand feet below. Towards noon he struck into a rude road--evidently the thoroughfare of the locality--and {{was surprised to find}} that it, as well as the adjacent soil wherever disturbed, was a deep Indian red. Everywhere, along its sides, powdering the banks and boles of trees with its ruddy stain, in mounds and hillocks of piled dirt on the road, or in liquid paint-like pools, when a trickling stream had formed a gutter across it, there was always the same deep sanguinary color. Once or twice it became more vivid in contrast with the white teeth of quartz that peeped through it from the hillside or crossed the road in crumbled strata. One of those pieces Clarence picked up with a quickening pulse. It was veined and streaked with shining mica and tiny glittering cubes of mineral that LOOKED like gold! ...|$|E
60|$|This is one {{of those}} spots so hard for the European naturalist to conceive, where with all the riches of a {{tropical}} vegetation, and partly perhaps from the very luxuriance of that vegetation, insects are as scarce as in the most barren parts of Europe, and hardly more conspicuous. In temperate climates there is a tolerable uniformity in the distribution of insects over those parts of a country {{in which there is a}} similarity in the vegetation, any deficiency being easily accounted for by the absence of wood or uniformity of surface. The traveller hastily passing through such a country can at once pick out a collecting ground which will afford him a fair notion of its entomology. Here the case is different. There are certain requisites of a good collecting ground which can only be ascertained to exist by some days' search in the vicinity of each village. In some places there is no virgin forest, as at Djilolo and Sahoe; in others there are no open pathways or clearings, as here. At Batchian there are only two tolerable collecting places,--the road to the coal mines, and the new clearings made by the Tomóre people, the latter being by far the most productive. I believe the fact to be that insects are pretty uniformly distributed over these countries (where the forests have not been cleared away), and are so scarce in any one spot that searching for them is almost useless. If the forest is all cleared away, almost all the insects disappear with it; but when small clearings and paths are made, the fallen trees in various stages of drying and decay, the rotting leaves, the loosening bark and the fungoid growths upon it, together with the flowers that appear in much greater abundance where the light is admitted, are so many attractions to the insects for miles around, and cause a wonderful accumulation of species and individuals. When the entomologist can discover such a spot, he does more in a mouth than he could possibly do by a year's search in the depths of the <b>undisturbed</b> <b>forest.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Regardless of the {{presence}} of humans in Brazilian forests, titi monkeys customarily venture to dwell in [...] "disturbed" [...] forests (forests that have been cut down or invaded by humans) as long as the food availability is higher than in undisturbed forests. The use of disturbed and <b>undisturbed</b> <b>forest</b> by masked titi monkeys Callicebus personatus melanochir is proportional to food availability. The Atlantic Forest of eastern Brazil has been cut down to 5% of its original state with only 2% of that being <b>undisturbed</b> <b>forest.</b> Their existence is completely dependent on their ability to successfully reside in disturbed forests. However, titis {{do not seem to be}} aware of the difference between a disturbed and <b>undisturbed</b> <b>forest.</b> As previously mentioned, they feed opportunistically and therefore will reside in whatever forest has the most food available.
