5|$|Bipartite verbal {{compounds}} such {{as these}} are not peculiar to any language in particular. They are in fact very common, and may even occur in every language, albeit with varying frequency. English {{has a number of}} complex predicates, include go sightseeing, have breakfast and take (a) bath. The event described by go sightseeing is unable to be described using a single verb sightsee; inflections like sightsaw and sightseen are <b>ungrammatical.</b> An event like take (a) bath, however, may be described by a single verb bathe, but it arguably has a slightly different meaning. Take (a) bath, in any case, is far more common.|$|E
5|$|Early work in {{neurolinguistics}} {{involved the}} study of language in people with brain lesions, to see how lesions in specific areas affect language and speech. In this way, neuroscientists in the 19th century discovered that two areas in the brain are crucially implicated in language processing. The first area is Wernicke's area, which {{is located in the}} posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus in the dominant cerebral hemisphere. People with a lesion in this area of the brain develop receptive aphasia, a condition {{in which there is a}} major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal sentence structure. The second area is Broca's area, located in the posterior inferior frontal gyrus of the dominant hemisphere. People with a lesion to this area develop expressive aphasia, meaning that they know what they want to say, they just cannot get it out. They are typically able to understand what is being said to them, but unable to speak fluently. Other symptoms that may be present in expressive aphasia include problems with fluency, articulation, word-finding, word repetition, and producing and comprehending complex grammatical sentences, both orally and in writing. Those with this aphasia also exhibit <b>ungrammatical</b> speech and show inability to use syntactic information to determine the meaning of sentences. Both expressive and receptive aphasia also affect the use of sign language, in analogous ways to how they affect speech, with expressive aphasia causing signers to sign slowly and with incorrect grammar, whereas a signer with receptive aphasia will sign fluently, but make little sense to others and have difficulties comprehending others' signs. This shows that the impairment is specific to the ability to use language, not to the physiology used for speech production.|$|E
25|$|Clearly, {{the second}} example {{is not a}} grammatically well-formed {{sentence}} in English. A child knows this and does not form sentences {{such as the one}} marked by the asterisk. How does the child know, without being explicitly taught, that the <b>ungrammatical</b> example is, in fact, <b>ungrammatical?</b> From the linguistic perspective being described here, {{the answer to this question}} is that such knowledge pre-exists as part of UG.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that these}} passivized {{sentences}} get progressively more <b>ungrammatical</b> in English {{as they move}} down the accessibility hierarchy; the last two, in particular, are so <b>ungrammatical</b> as to be almost unparsable by English speakers. However, those languages with severe restrictions on which roles can be relativized are precisely those that can passivize almost any position, and hence the last two sentences would be normal in these languages.|$|E
25|$|The omitted subject {{argument}} of the embedded clause must {{correspond to the}} subject (nominative) of the matrix-clause. If it corresponds to the object (accusative), the sentence is <b>ungrammatical.</b>|$|E
25|$|That the {{relative}} acceptability of (11c) {{is related to}} a frequency affect is confirmed {{by the fact that}} ordinarily such sentences are judged to be <b>ungrammatical,</b> as shown in (12).|$|E
25|$|Note {{the use of}} the {{reflexive}} pronoun “se” in (11), {{which is}} required for the sentence to be grammatically correct in French. When the reflexive pronoun is not present, the sentence is <b>ungrammatical.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the <b>ungrammatical</b> (8a), {{the verb}} wàra (to split), follows the {{possessor}} m. Due to possessor switch, the verb {{must be placed}} closer to the possessor. The grammatical (8b) does this by having wàra switch with the possessor.|$|E
25|$|A wh-island {{is created}} by an {{embedded}} sentence which is introduced by a wh-word. Wh-islands are weaker than adjunct islands since extraction is often quite awkward, {{but they are not}} necessarily considered to be <b>ungrammatical</b> by all speakers.|$|E
25|$|The {{examples}} below {{illustrate that}} the same phrase, the table's legs, is regarded as inalienable possession in Italian but not in French: (1b) is <b>ungrammatical</b> (as indicated by the asterisk); French cannot use the inalienable possession construction for a relationship which is alienable.|$|E
25|$|A speaker's {{linguistic}} competence, {{which is}} the knowledge that they have of their language, allows them to easily judge whether a sentence is grammatical or <b>ungrammatical</b> based on intuitive introspection. For this reason, such judgements are sometimes called introspective grammaticality judgements.|$|E
25|$|Subjacency {{says that}} you cannot relate two {{positions}} across two bounding nodes. In (13), {{we see that the}} movement of the wh-expression 'what' was moved past a CP and a TP to get to the Spec CP position- thus this phrase is <b>ungrammatical.</b>|$|E
25|$|If {{explicit}} possessors {{are absent}} (as in (11b) and (12b)), the phrase is <b>ungrammatical.</b> In (11), the possessor ni {{is necessary for}} the inalienable noun nik (arm). In (12), the same phenomenon is found with the inalienable noun ookmis (grandmother), which needs the possessor morpheme n to be grammatical.|$|E
25|$|ASL {{sentences}} {{may have}} up to two marked topics. Possible combinations of topic types are two tm2 topics, two tm3 topics, tm2 preceding tm1, tm3 preceding tm1, and tm2 preceding tm3. Sentences with these topic combinations in the opposite orders or with two tm1 topics are considered <b>ungrammatical</b> by native signers.|$|E
25|$|According to Guéron, {{a benefit}} of this {{hypothesis}} {{is that it is}} consistent with principles of syntactic movement such as locality of selection and c-command. If the position it needs to move to is already filled, as with a transitive verb like see, the possessor cannot raise, and the sentence is correctly predicted as <b>ungrammatical.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} methods that {{successfully}} investigate sentence processing, {{some of which}} include eye tracking, self-paced listening and reading, or cross-modal priming. The most productive method however, is real-time grammaticality judgements. A grammaticality judgement is a test which involves showing participants sentences that are either grammatical or <b>ungrammatical.</b> The participant must {{decide whether or not}} they find the sentences to be grammatical as quickly as possible. Grammaticality is cross-linguistic, so this method has therefore be used on a wide variety languages Grammaticality judgements are largely based on an individuals linguistic intuition, and it has been pointed out that humans have the ability to understand as well as produce an infinitely large number of new sentences that that have never seen before. This allows us to accurately judge a sentence grammatical or <b>ungrammatical,</b> even if it a completely novel sentence.|$|E
25|$|Out of the {{thousands}} of words used in the Zohar, Scholem finds two anachronistic terms and nine cases of <b>ungrammatical</b> usage of words. This proves {{that the majority of the}} Zohar was written within the accepted time frame and only a small amount was added later (in the Geonic period as mentioned).|$|E
25|$|A {{grammatical}} string is {{not necessarily}} meaningful, as exemplified by Chomsky’s famous sentence ‘Colorless green ideas sleep furiously’. However, language speakers can still understand nonsensical string by natural intonation and that speakers are able to recall them more easily than <b>ungrammatical</b> sentences. It is also suggested that speakers {{are supposed to have}} intuitions about grammaticality, which is determined by their competence on that language.|$|E
25|$|Another {{group of}} poets, the Language school (or L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E, after the {{magazine}} that bears that name), have continued and extended the Modernist and Objectivist {{traditions of the}} 1930s. Some poets associated with the group are Lyn Hejinian, Ron Silliman, Bob Perelman and Leslie Scalapino. Their poems—fragmentary, purposefully <b>ungrammatical,</b> sometimes mixing texts from different sources and idioms—can be by turns abstract, lyrical, and highly comic.|$|E
25|$|In {{a similar}} study, Saffran found that adults and older {{children}} (first and second grade children) were also sensitive to syntactical information after exposure to an artificial language {{which had no}} cues to phrase structure other than the statistical regularities that were present. Both adults and children were able to pick out sentences that were <b>ungrammatical</b> at a rate greater than chance, even under an “incidental” exposure condition in which participants’ primary goal was to complete a different task while hearing the language.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the previous example, omission of the marker de is <b>ungrammatical,</b> as in example (29b). The linguistic distance between the possessor and possessee is much smaller for the example in (29b) than in (29a). It {{has been argued that}} omission of de only occurs in kinship relationships, whereas phrasal constructions with a mandatory de encompasses other inalienable possession examples such as body parts. This contradicts the notion that inalienable possession is marked by less linguistic distance between the possessor and possessee.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{constraint}} in Tagalog on {{the position}} {{from which a}} noun can be relativised and in which a gap can appear: A noun {{has to be the}} subject within the relative clause in order for it to be relativised. The phrases in (2) are <b>ungrammatical</b> because the nouns that have been relativised are not the subjects of their respective relative clauses. In (2a), the gap is in direct object position, while in (2b), the gap is in indirect object position.|$|E
25|$|Multiple {{arguments}} against this, by Pylkkänen and by Hole, state otherwise. Pylkkänen's argument, about low applicatives and high applicatives, states {{that on a}} syntax tree level, low applicatives have an applicative morpheme below the verb in a sentence and involve an additional v, or pronoun maker. In looking at the German examples, (40) is deemed <b>ungrammatical</b> due to the possessor-raising and misplacement of the pronoun maker, or lack of a bound variable interpretation. To Pylkkänen, (39) is considered a low applicative sentence, and grammatical.|$|E
25|$|Evidence from {{a series}} of four {{experiments}} conducted by Gomez and Gerken suggests that children are able to generalize grammatical structures with less than two minutes of exposure to an artificial grammar. In the first experiment, 11-12 month-old infants were trained on an artificial grammar composed of nonsense words with a set grammatical structure. At test, infants heard both novel grammatical and <b>ungrammatical</b> sentences. Infants oriented longer towards the grammatical sentences, in line with previous research that suggests that infants generally orient for a longer amount of time to natural instances of language rather than altered instances of language e.g.,. (This familiarity preference differs from the novelty preference generally found in word-learning studies, due to the differences between lexical acquisition and syntactical acquisition.) This finding indicates that young children are sensitive to the grammatical structure of language even after minimal exposure. Gomez and Gerken also found that this sensitivity is evident when <b>ungrammatical</b> transitions are located {{in the middle of the}} sentence (unlike in the first experiment, in which all the errors occurred at the beginning and end of the sentences), that the results could not be due to an innate preference for the grammatical sentences caused by something other than grammar, and that children are able to generalize the grammatical rules to new vocabulary.|$|E
25|$|In first {{syllable}} reduplication, the A-not-A operator copies {{the first}} syllable of the adjacent MWd and moves the reduplicant, the copied syllable, {{to the left}} of the base MWd. Then the negation is inserted between the reduplicant and base to form a grammatical sentence. In fig. (1.a) The A-not-A operator copies the first syllable tao of the MWd taoyan. The reduplicant tao is put at the left of the base taoyan and then the negative constituent bu is inserted in between. In fig. (1.b) *Zhangsan taoyan Lisi-bu-tao is <b>ungrammatical</b> because tao cannot be put to the right of the maximal projection VP, taoyan Lisi.|$|E
25|$|Clarke {{knew the}} {{geography}} of the region {{better than any other}} person of his time, as his office was responsible for every land survey made in East Florida between 1811 and 1821. Clarke profited from the acquisition and resale of large tracts of land, and his landholdings were among the largest in Florida. In his will he distributed more than 33,000 acres to his heirs, as well as several houses and scattered lots. He spoke Spanish fluently, but his writing in the language was <b>ungrammatical.</b> His initials have been given incorrectly by many historians as I. F., confusion arising because the capital Is and Js of his handwriting were indistinguishable. His will shows his given name to have been George John Frederic Clarke.|$|E
25|$|Together {{these studies}} suggest that infants are able to extract a {{substantial}} amount of syntactic knowledge even from limited exposure to a language. Children apparently detected grammatical anomalies whether the grammatical violation in the test sentences occurred at the end or {{in the middle of the}} sentence. Additionally, even when the individual words of the grammar were changed, infants were still able to discriminate between grammatical and <b>ungrammatical</b> strings during the test phase. This generalization indicates that infants were not learning vocabulary-specific grammatical structures, but abstracting the general rules of that grammar and applying those rules to novel vocabulary. Furthermore, in all four experiments, the test of grammatical structures occurred five minutes after the initial exposure to the artificial grammar had ended, suggesting that the infants were able to maintain the grammatical abstractions they had learned even after a short delay.|$|E
25|$|A related finding {{indicates}} that slightly older infants can acquire both lexical and grammatical regularities {{from a single}} set of input, suggesting {{that they are able}} to use outputs of one type of statistical learning (cues that lead to the discovery of word boundaries) as input to a second type (cues that lead to the discovery of syntactical regularities. At test, 12-month-olds preferred to listen to sentences that had the same grammatical structure as the artificial language they had been tested on rather than sentences that had a different (<b>ungrammatical)</b> structure. Because learning grammatical regularities requires infants to be able to determine boundaries between individual words, this {{indicates that}} infants who are still quite young are able to acquire multiple levels of language knowledge (both lexical and syntactical) simultaneously, indicating that statistical learning is a powerful mechanism at play in language learning.|$|E
25|$|On tests between November 1971 and May 1972 Curtiss {{determined}} that Genie viewed non-specific adjectives describing size, such {{as little as}} absolute rather than relative values without superlative or comparative markers. Between January and May 1972 her comprehension of noun-modifier sentences significantly increased and starting in May 1972, after Curtiss replaced the word little with tiny, Genie showed clear comprehension of them. Genie clearly understood both the word more and the suffix -er as comparatives by January 1972, but never used them in her own speech. Prior to 1972 Genie responded to the conjunctions and and or as if they both meant and, but even after recognizing {{there was a difference}} never fully grasped the meaning of or. On tests she showed perfect comprehension of and while correctly responding to the word or fewer than 10% of the time, but she always understood disjunction marked by the word or in everyday conversation. She never attempted to use any other conjunctions, and with one possible highly <b>ungrammatical</b> exception never tried to connect two sentences.|$|E
25|$|Late {{learners}} of L2 perform worse on grammaticality judgment tasks or tests than native speakers {{or early}} acquirers, in that L2 learners {{are more likely}} to accept a sentence that is <b>ungrammatical</b> as grammatical. After the critical period, age of acquisition is no longer supposed to have an effect, and native-like performance is no longer supposed to be achievable. However, {{the idea that there is}} a critical period for the acquisition of syntactic competence, which is reflected by the ability to assess the well-formedness of a sentence, is controversial. On one view, biological or language-specific mechanisms become non-functional after a certain age. On another view, decreased L2 learning ability with age is not inevitable, and can be explained by factors such as motivation, learning environment, pressure, and time commitment. Although there is evidence that supports the claim that speakers outside the L2 mastery age range are not capable of acquiring native-like mastery of a language, there is also evidence supporting the opposite, as well as evidence for young learners not mastering an L2.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, he {{released}} his autobiography, Transformed, which was co-written by Peter Jeffs. It received generally positive reviews: Christianity Magazine said {{the book was}} a [...] "disarmingly honest account of Primus's triumphs and struggles {{on and off the}} pitch" [...] while FourFourTwo described it as [...] "an antidote to the 'me-me-me' tales that weigh down the shelves". Rival football magazine When Saturday Comes was more critical, pointing out its [...] "sometimes <b>ungrammatical</b> and often ponderous style" [...] and going on to say [...] " [...] book is also full of cliches".|$|E
500|$|He {{was a man}} of some education, with {{knowledge}} of French and calligraphy. In signing his accounts for 1621 and 1622 as chamberlain he decorated them with a couplet in French from a romance by Mellin de Saint-Gelais. Quiney writes [...] "Bien heureux est celui qui pour devenir sage, Qui pour le mal d'autrui fait son apprentissage" [...] but the original is [...] "Heureux celui qui pour devenir sage, Du mal d'autrui fait son apprentissage". The original translates into English as [...] "Happy is he who to become wise, serves his apprenticeship from other men's troubles" [...] but Quiney's version [...] "… is <b>ungrammatical</b> and without sense".|$|E
500|$|Furthermore, Johnson {{believed}} that later editors both misunderstood {{the historical context}} of Shakespeare and his plays, and underestimated the degree of textual corruption that the plays exhibit. He {{believed that}} this was because [...] "The style of Shakespeare was in itself perplexed, <b>ungrammatical,</b> and obscure". To correct these problems, Johnson believed that the original works {{would need to be}} examined, and this became an issue in his Proposal. Johnson also believed that an edition of Shakespeare could provide him with the income and recognition that he needed. However, a full edition of Shakespeare would require a publisher to make a large commitment of time and money, so Johnson decided to begin by focusing on a single play, Macbeth.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to receiving contributions directly from France, Românul Literar published translations of poems by Frédéric Mistral (translator: Elena Văcărescu), Jean Moréas (Demetriade) and Albert Samain (Popescu-Polyctet). Other than poetry and fiction, Românul Literar hosted literary and scientific essays, including ones by Caion, Ținc, Ioan Tanoviceanu, Orest Tafrali and others. The journal also enlisted contributions from poet Cornelia [...] "Riria" [...] Gatovschi and her husband, the formerly Junimist historian A. D. Xenopol. Românul Literars founder was especially enthusiastic about Riria. Against mainstream critics, who derided her poetry as stale and <b>ungrammatical,</b> he proclaimed {{the dawn of}} a new era, with Mrs. Xenopol as its herald. Caion, Tocilescu and the Xenopols were members of a small professional association, called [...] "Romanian Society for Arts and Literature".|$|E
500|$|A {{scholar of}} linguistics, Lowell {{was one of}} the founders of the American Dialect Society. He used this {{interest}} in his writing, particularly in The Biglow Papers, presenting a heavily <b>ungrammatical</b> phonetic spelling of the Yankee dialect, a method called eye dialect. In using this vernacular, Lowell intended to get closer to the common man's experience and was rebelling against more formal and, as he thought, unnatural representations of Americans in literature. As he wrote in his introduction to The Biglow Papers, [...] "few American writers or speakers wield their native language with the directness, precision, and force that are common as the day in the mother country". Though intentionally humorous, this accurate presentation of the dialect was pioneering work in American literature. [...] For example, Lowell's character Hosea Biglow says in verse: ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Rosen, {{a novelist}} and poet, {{advocated}} {{the books were}} not suited for children, who {{would be unable to}} grasp the complex themes. Rosen also stated that [...] "J. K.

His overall view of the series was negative – [...] "the Potter saga was essentially patronising, conservative, highly derivative, dispiritingly nostalgic for a bygone Britain", and he speaks of [...] "a pedestrian, <b>ungrammatical</b> prose style". Ursula K. Le Guin said, [...] "I have no great opinion of it. When so many adult critics were carrying on about the 'incredible originality' of the first Harry Potter book, I read it {{to find out what the}} fuss was about, and remained somewhat puzzled; it seemed a lively kid's fantasy crossed with a [...] "school novel", good fare for its age group, but stylistically ordinary, imaginatively derivative, and ethically rather mean-spirited." ...|$|E
