40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the causes of}} Federal Reserve policy errors during the Great Depression. It finds compelling evidence that the Fed developed a flawed strategy during the 1920 s, and continued to <b>use</b> <b>that</b> <b>strategy</b> during the depression. The Fed's strategy relied {{on the behavior of}} member bank borrowing and interest rates as policy indicators. A detailed empirical examination of borrowed reserve demand reveals the errors in the Fed's strategy and helps to explain why the Fed did not undertake vigorous countercyclical policy during the depression.

25|$|While some {{research}} indicates that psychological resilience is a relatively stable personality trait, new research suggests that positive emotions are critical to trait resilience. This {{is not to say}} that positive emotions are merely a by-product of resilience, but rather that feeling positive emotions during stressful experiences may have adaptive benefits in the coping process of the individual. Empirical evidence for this prediction arises from research on resilient individuals who have a propensity for coping <b>strategies</b> <b>that</b> <b>concretely</b> elicit positive emotions, such as benefit-finding and cognitive reappraisal, humor, optimism, and goal-directed problem-focused coping. Individuals who tend to approach problems with these methods of coping may strengthen their resistance to stress by allocating more access to these positive emotional resources. Social support from caring adults encouraged resilience among participants by providing them with access to conventional activities.|$|R

It is noted that Hypothesis Testing Theory (HTT) as proposed by Levine (1966) can provide a guiding framework to study debugging. Experiments 1 and 2 tested the following hypothesis: Given a very simple debugging task for which there is a clearly defined optimal strategy for solution, would people discover and <b>use</b> <b>that</b> <b>strategy.</b> Subjects tended to discover and use the optimal strategy in experiment 1, but not for the slightly more complex task of experiment 2.

40|$|Background: The {{traveling}} salesperson problem (TSP) {{refers to}} a task in which one finds the shortest path when traveling through multiple spatially distributed points. Little {{is known about the}} developmental course of the strategies used to solve TSPs. The present study examined young children’s performance and route selection strategies in one-way TSPs using a city-block metric. A touch screen-based navigation task was applied. Methodology/Principal Findings: Children (39 – 70 months) and adults (21 – 35 years) made serial responses on a touch screen to move a picture of a dog (the target) to two or three identical pictures of a bone (the goals). For all the versions of the tasks, significant improvement in measures of performance was observed from younger to older participants. In TSPs in which a specific route selection strategy such as the nearest-neighbor strategy minimized the total traveling distance, older participants <b>used</b> <b>that</b> <b>strategy</b> more frequently than younger ones. By contrast, in TSPs in which multiple strategies equally led to the minimal traveling distance...|$|R

Acoustic measures of spectral balance, vibrato, duration and intensity were related to the composite ratings using multiple regression analyses.

40|$|Testing a {{software}} artefact using {{every one of}} its possible inputs would normally cost too much, and take too long, compared to the benefits of detecting faults in the software. Instead, a testing strategy is used to select a small subset of the inputs with which to test the software. The criterion used to select this subset affects the likelihood that faults in the software will be detected. For some testing strategies, the criterion may result in subsets that are very efficient at detecting faults, but implementing the strategy [...] deriving a 'concrete strategy' specific to the software artefact [...] is so difficult {{that it is not}} cost-effective to <b>use</b> <b>that</b> <b>strategy</b> in practice. In this thesis, we propose the use of metaheuristic search to derive concrete testing strategies in a cost-effective manner. We demonstrate a search-based algorithm <b>that</b> derives concrete <b>strategies</b> for 'statistical testing', a testing <b>strategy</b> <b>that</b> has a good fault-detecting ability in theory, but which is costly to implement in practice. The cost-effectiveness of the search-based approach is enhanced by the rigorous empirical determination of an efficient algorithm configuration and associated parameter settings, and by the exploitation of low-cost commodity GPU cards to reduce the time taken by the algorithm. The use of a flexible grammar-based representation for the test inputs ensures the applicability of the algorithm {{to a wide range of}} software...|$|R
