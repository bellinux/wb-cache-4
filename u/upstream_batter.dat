40|$|With {{a view to}} {{facilitating the}} {{determination}} of the pressure line within the section of a debris dam, charts have been prepared which give the position of the pressure line in the base and top {{as well as in the}} joints through the points dividing the height of the dam into six equal parts. The distance of the point where the line cuts a horizontal section from the centre of the section is expressed in terms of the <b>upstream</b> <b>batter</b> and the respective ratios of the spillway width and overflow depth to the depth of the section below the spillway, the downstream batter being assumed 0. 2 : 1 and the specific weight of the masonry twice that of the overflowing water...|$|E
60|$|Namgay Doola had {{scrambled}} {{out on the}} jam and was clawing out {{the butt}} of a log with a rude sort of boat-hook. It slid forward slowly as an alligator moves, three or four others followed it, and the green water spouted through the gaps they had made. Then the villagers howled and shouted and scrambled across the logs, pulling and pushing the obstinate timber, and the red head of Namgay Doola was chief among them all. The logs swayed and chafed and groaned as fresh consignments from <b>upstream</b> <b>battered</b> the now weakening dam. All gave way at last in a smother of foam, racing logs, bobbing black heads and confusion indescribable. The river tossed everything before it. I saw the red head go down with the last remnants of the jam and disappear between the great grinding tree- trunks. It rose close {{to the bank and}} blowing like a grampus. Namgay Doola wrung the water out of his eyes and made obeisance to the King. I had time to observe him closely. The virulent redness of his shock head and beard was most startling; and in the thicket of hair wrinkled above high cheek bones shone two very merry blue eyes. He was indeed an outlander, but yet a Thibetan in language, habit, and attire. He spoke the Lepcha dialect with an indescribable softening of the gutturals. It was not so much a lisp as an accent.|$|R
