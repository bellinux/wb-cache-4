40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} method for {{reconfiguring}} Virtual Objects (VOs) during run-time. VOs are semantic descriptions of ICT objects and the associated physical objects and phenomena they observe. VOs also include software modules to expose ICT object functionalities as IoT services for re-use. In our case study we show, by using an analytical model, how the energy efficiency of a wireless battery powered weather station (WS) can be improved. We introduce descriptions of the available operating modes and store them in the WS semantic description. These operating modes of the WS's VO are linked with {{the ability of the}} ICT object to change the compression method used to transmit information during run-time. We evaluate the energy efficiency and latency of three operating modes, namely uncompressed, lossy and lossless modes.

Our goal is to create maps as realistic as possible of the relevant physical contributions which may contribute to the detected signals. This astrophysical modeling is followed by simulations of the measurement process itself by a given instrumental configuration. This will enable a precise determination of what can and cannot be achieved with a particular experimental configuration, and provide a feedback on how to improve the overall design. It is a key step on the way to define procedures for the separation of the different physical processes in the future observed maps.

50|$|MPEG-1 or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III, more {{commonly}} referred to as MP3 (or mp3), is an audio coding format for digital audio. It uses a form of lossy data compression to encode data using inexact approximations and partial data discarding to reduce file sizes, typically by a factor of 10, in comparison with a CD while retaining a sound quality comparable <b>to</b> <b>uncompressed</b> audio. Compared <b>to</b> CD quality digital audio, MP3 compression commonly achieves 75 to 95% reduction in size. MP3 files are thus 1/4 to 1/20 the size of the original digital audio stream. This is important for both transmission and storage concerns. The basis for such comparison is the CD digital audio format which requires 1411.2 kbit/s. A commonly used MP3 encoding setting is CBR 128 kbit/s resulting in file of 1/11 (=9%) {{of the size of the}} original CD-quality file, that is with 91% compression.|$|R

The cars were going far faster over time, particularly with the increased engine capacity rules for 1966 onwards from 1.5 litres <b>uncompressed</b> <b>to</b> 3 litres <b>uncompressed</b> or 1.5 litres compressed. The Montjuic circuit was a first in Grand Prix racing- the circuit was completely Armco-lined. Although safety measures in 1969 were still nearly non-existent compared to today's modern safety standards, these measures were a new step forward to protect drivers from further harm. About half the circuits in Formula One at this time had some safety standards, such as Monaco, Silverstone and Magdalena Mixhuca in Mexico City; although circuits were nearly unchanged from previous years, such as the Nürburgring in Germany and the Clermont-Ferrand circuit in France; both were mountain road circuits {{with all kinds of}} unprotected drop offs and solid obstacles on the sides of both circuits. Another example was the feared Spa-Francorchamps circuit in Belgium. The Belgian Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps was boycotted by many of the drivers because of the extreme danger of the track after an overall inspection of Spa by Jackie Stewart, who was responsible for most of the activities in Formula One {{to try to make it}} safer. He demanded changes to the circuit that the track owners did not want to pay for, so the race was boycotted and eventually cancelled. Spa was included in 1970 after Armco was added to the track.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—An {{approach}} to the direct measurement of perception of video quality change using electroencephalography (EEG) is presented. Subjects viewed 8 -s video clips while their brain activity was registered using EEG. The video signal was either uncompressed at full length or changed from <b>uncompressed</b> <b>to</b> a lower quality level at a random time point. The distortions were introduced by a hybrid video codec. Subjects had to indicate whether they had perceived a quality change. In response to a quality change, a positive voltage change in EEG (the so-called P 3 component) was observed at latency of about 400 – 600 ms for all subjects. The voltage change positively correlated with {{the magnitude of the}} video quality change, substantiating the P 3 component as a graded neural index of the perception of video quality change within the presented paradigm. By applying machine learning techniques, we could classify on a single-trial basis whether a subject perceived a quality change. Interestingly, some video clips wherein changes were missed (i. e., not reported) by the subject were classified as quality changes, suggesting that the brain detected a change, although the subject did not press a button. In conclusion, abrupt changes of video quality give rise to specific components in the EEG that can be detected on a single-trial basis. Potentially, a neurotechnological {{approach to}} video assessment could lead to a more objective quantification of quality change detection, overcoming the limitations of subjective approaches (such as subjective bias and the requirement of an overt response). Furthermore, it allows for real-time applications wherein the brain response to a video clip is monitored while it is being viewed...|$|R
