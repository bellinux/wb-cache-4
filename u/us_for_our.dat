Their skills complemented each other; Stanton, the better orator and writer, scripted many of Anthony's speeches, while Anthony was the movement's organizer and tactician. Stanton once wrote to Anthony, [...] "No power in heaven, hell or earth can separate <b>us,</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> hearts are eternally wedded together." [...] Likewise, when writing a tribute that appeared in The New York Times when Stanton died, Anthony described Stanton as having [...] "forged the thunderbolts" [...] that she (Anthony) [...] "fired." [...] Unlike Anthony's relatively narrow focus on suffrage, Stanton wanted to push for a broader platform of women's rights in general. While their opposing viewpoints led to some discussion and conflict, no disagreement threatened their friendship or working relationship; the two women remained close friends and colleagues until Stanton's death some 50 years after their initial meeting. While always recognized as movement leaders whose support was sought, Stanton and Anthony's voices were soon joined by others who began assuming leadership positions within the movement. These women included, among others, Matilda Joslyn Gage.|$|E

Founder James Abourezk initially was motivated by unfair stereotyping of Arabs in media, anti-Arabism in general and the Abscam sting where Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI") agents posed as Arabs. He brought together more than 60 Arab leaders from around the nation who agreed to form the committee. Abourezk has stated: [...] "When we started up people used to ask us why we started. Now they ask <b>us</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> opinion on things.” ...|$|E

'What have they done to our poor people?' he said after a long silence." [...] He added, [...] "On his return to Moscow, Yeltsin would confess the pain he had felt after the Houston excursion: the ‘pain for all of <b>us,</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> country so rich, so talented and so exhausted by incessant experiments.’” ...|$|E

He said that [...] "subjecting the judiciary to partisan politics is a betrayal of democracy." [...] He also said that the rally was only the beginning, adding: [...] "This is a rebirth for <b>us,</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> country and our children. We will revolt against injustice." [...] He said that the April constitutional referendum that had eliminated the post of prime minister and greatly expanded the powers of the presidency was [...] "unlawful" [...] (the changes take effect in 2019). Because the state of emergency was in place when the referendum was carried out, Kılıçdaroğlu said that [...] "all public resources were exploited to manipulate the outcome".|$|E
2500|$|Romania's President, Klaus Iohannis, {{wrote on}} his Facebook page {{that he was}} [...] "deeply grieved by the tragic events that {{happened}} this evening {{in the center of}} the Capital". He added: [...] "It is a very sad day for all of <b>us,</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> nation and for me personally". He visited the scene, saying safety regulations seem to have been ignored. Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he was cutting short a visit to Mexico to return to Bucharest. On 31 October, the government decreed three days of national mourning, which was the first time in 15 years when three days of national mourning had been decreed in Romania. Halloween concerts and parties scheduled for that evening were cancelled across the country, and a campaign on Facebook urging people to avoid clubs and bars that night, and intended both to show respect to the victims and as a form of protest against inadequate safety precautions in such establishments, garnered over 100,000 supporters.|$|E
