60|$|She, realising, sank {{upon the}} hearth-rug and lay there curled upon herself. She was defeated. But she, too, would never yield. She lay quite {{motionless}} for some time.

60|$|This comes rather {{nearer to}} the mark than the author's {{description}} of a proper administration, {{under the name of}} men of ability and virtue, which conveys no definite idea at all; nor does it apply specifically to our grand national distemper. All parties pretend to these qualities. The present ministry, no favorites of the author, will be ready enough to declare themselves persons of virtue and ability; and if they choose a vote for that purpose, perhaps it would not be quite impossible for them to procure it. But, if the disease be this distrust and disconnection, it is easy to know who are sound and who are tainted; who are fit to restore us to health, who to continue, and to spread the contagion. The present ministry being made <b>up</b> of <b>draughts</b> from all parties in the kingdom, if they should profess any adherence to the connections they have left, they must convict themselves of the blackest treachery. They therefore choose rather to renounce the principle itself, and to brand it with the name of pride and faction. This test with certainty discriminates the opinions of men. The other is a description vague and unsatisfactory.|$|R

Before night, indeed, the squire had sent down to Sidmouth for Dr. Walsham's successor, who said that Aggie was very feverish, and must be kept perfectly quiet for some days. He sent her <b>up</b> a soothing <b>draught,</b> and Mrs. Walsham sat up with her all night. She slept but little, and talked almost incessantly, sometimes rambling a little.|$|R
