5|$|Similar {{results can}} be {{extended}} from closed curves to <b>unbounded</b> curves satisfying a local Lipschitz condition. For such curves, if {{both sides of the}} curve have infinite area, then the evolved curve remains smooth and singularity-free for all time. However, if one side of an <b>unbounded</b> curve has finite area, and the curve has finite total absolute curvature, then its evolution reaches a singularity in time proportional to the area on the finite-area side of the curve, with <b>unbounded</b> curvature near the singularity. For curves that are graphs of sufficiently well-behaved functions, asymptotic to a ray in each direction, the solution converges in shape to a unique shape that is asymptotic to the same rays.|$|E

5|$|Largely {{concerned}} with gender issues, Midas {{comments on the}} definitions of femininity and masculinity {{in the early nineteenth}} century and the developing ideology of separate spheres which encouraged women to restrict themselves to domestic affairs and men to political affairs. Part of the Romantic interest in rewriting classical myths, Midas focuses on challenging patriarchy and satirising the <b>unbounded</b> accumulation of wealth.|$|E
5|$|The {{exponent}} in the |V(H)|O(k)-time algorithm {{cannot be}} lowered significantly: no algorithm with running time |V(H)|o(tw(G) /log tw(G)) exists, assuming the exponential time hypothesis (ETH), {{even if the}} inputs are restricted to any class of graphs of <b>unbounded</b> treewidth.|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} variations of binary search. In particular, fractional cascading speeds up binary {{searches for the}} same value in multiple arrays, efficiently solving a series of search problems in computational geometry and numerous other fields. Exponential search extends binary search to <b>unbounded</b> lists. The binary search tree and B-tree data structures are based on binary search.|$|E
5|$|Every shallow minor of a graph of bounded book {{thickness}} is a sparse graph, whose {{ratio of}} edges to vertices is bounded by a constant that depends {{only on the}} depth of the minor and on the book thickness. That is, in the terminology of , the graphs of bounded book thickness have bounded expansion. However, even the graphs of bounded degree, a much stronger requirement than having bounded expansion, can have <b>unbounded</b> book thickness.|$|E
5|$|If {{ever there}} was a book {{calculated}} to make a man in love with its author, this appears to me to be the book. She speaks of her sorrows, in a way that fills us with melancholy, and dissolves us in tenderness, {{at the same time that}} she displays a genius which commands all our admiration. Affliction had tempered her heart to a softness almost more than human; and the gentleness of her spirit seems precisely to accord with all the romance of <b>unbounded</b> attachment.|$|E
5|$|Later work by Wolfram {{identifies}} the one-dimensional Rule 37R automaton as being particularly interesting in this respect. When {{run on a}} finite array of cells with periodic boundary conditions, starting from a small seed of random cells centered within a larger empty neighborhood, it tends to fluctuate between ordered and chaotic states. However, with the same initial conditions on an <b>unbounded</b> set of cells its configurations tend to organize themselves into several types of simple moving particles.|$|E
5|$|Many {{authors have}} speculated that {{at the core of}} this {{symbolic}} explosion, and in tandem, was the development of syntactic language that evolved through a highly specialized social learning system providing the means for semantically <b>unbounded</b> discourse.

5|$|The play also {{features}} an ambiguous and multifaceted portrayal of scientific knowledge, celebrating it for its humanistic achievements and discoveries, but also warning {{that it can}} do immense harm when {{in the hands of}} the unethical or overambitious. Given these themes, the play is likely Verne's most purely science-fictional work. Structurally, the play evokes the three-part design of Jacques Offenbach's opera The Tales of Hoffmann, in which the hero must choose between love and art. In Journey Through the Impossible, however, the choice is between positive ideals—love, goodness, happiness—and the <b>unbounded</b> scientific ambitions of the sinister Doctor Ox.|$|E

25|$|A {{strengthening}} of this result was proved by Reisch by reducing quantified Boolean formula in {{conjunctive normal form}} to Hex played on arbitrary planar graphs. In computational complexity theory, it is widely conjectured that PSPACE-complete problems cannot be solved with efficient (polynomial time) algorithms. This result limits {{the efficiency of the}} best possible algorithms when considering arbitrary positions on boards of <b>unbounded</b> size, but it doesn't rule out the possibility of a simple winning strategy for the initial position (on boards of <b>unbounded</b> size), or a simple winning strategy for all positions on a board of a particular size.|$|E
