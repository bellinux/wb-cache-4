5|$|Prominent Swedish {{entomologist}} Carl Stål {{named the}} genus Abricta in 1866, {{and it was}} either treated as a subgenus of the genus Tibicen or a genus in its own right. Thus it became known as Tibicen curvicostus, and Abricta curvicosta from 1906. French entomologist Jean Baptiste Boisduval described two specimens collected from Port Jackson as Cicada tephrogaster (later Tibicen tephrogaster) in 1835; this has long been considered a junior synonym. However, {{a review of the}} genus in 2003 showed Abricta to be a disparate group of species, and the Australian members were moved to other genera. Max Moulds conducted a morphological analysis of the genus and found the cicadas split naturally into clades according to biogeographical region. Of the 15Australian species, the floury baker was the earliest offshoot. Unpublished data confirmed it was quite genetically distant from the other 14species, and so it was classified in a new monotypic genus Aleeta, while most of the others were placed in the genus Tryella. The morphological distinction between Aleeta and Tryella is based on two factors: A.curvicosta has a larger forewing size– rarely less than 3.2cm (1.3in) and usually over 4cm (1.6in), whereas Tryella is never above 3.2cm (1.3in); the <b>uncal</b> lobes of Aleetas distinctive male genitalia are downturned at their distal ends, whereas those of Tryella are upturned. The name Aleeta is derived from the Greek aleton meaning flour or meal.|$|E

25|$|In 2003 TCB, a band {{based in}} the Washington area, created a spinoff sound from go-go called bounce beat. Bounce beat is a heavier version of its {{ancestor}} that relies on timbales, drums, keyboards and bass to form its signature sound. At a time when bands like Backyard, <b>UnCalled</b> 4, and Raw Image were moving the genre toward a more driving sound by using a more forceful “breakdown” beat, bounce beat seems, in retrospect, like a natural progression. Still, the music was initially dismissed by all but a core of believers. It took fans time to realize TCB’s innovation wasn’t a rejection of “traditional” go-go, but a shift. Instead of paying homage to the genre’s early greats by copying their style, bounce beat built on a strong foundation and showed that the music still had more ideas to explore, limited only by percussive innovation and imagination. Fans of bounce beat, like the sound itself, tend to be much younger than the traditional go-go crowd. The rototom-dependent subgenre was initially maligned—some called it “noise,” others argued that it wasn’t go-go at all. Criticism of bounce beat was similar to what was said about the trap rap bubbling in other cities around the same time: It was blasted for its sometimes suggestive lyrics, its thwacking beat, its tempos that vacillated between syrupy and frenetic. But over time, bounce beat made inroads.|$|R
2500|$|In <b>uncal</b> herniation, {{a common}} subtype of transtentorial herniation, the {{innermost}} {{part of the}} temporal lobe, the uncus, can be squeezed {{so much that it}} moves towards the tentorium and puts pressure on the brainstem, most notably the midbrain.

This does not put as much pressure on the brainstem as the other types of herniation, but it may interfere with blood vessels in the frontal lobes that are close to the site of injury (anterior cerebral artery), or it may progress to central herniation.

Another dire consequence of increased ICP combined with a space-occupying process is brain herniation (usually <b>uncal</b> or tonsilar).

"At {{the time}} that Henry and Garrard {{analyzed}} and published the Tor Hamar assemblage, it was commonly believed that microburin technique appeared relatively late in the Levantine Epipaleolithic sequence, perhaps being derived from microburin technique in Egypt. Since then, however, several Jordanian sites have produced evidence of microburin technique {{well in advance of}} {{the latter part of the}} Epipaleolithic sequence. These include Wadi Uwaynid 18 and Wadi Uwaynid 14 in the Azraq region of Jordan, with radiocarbon dates between 19 800 and 18 400 <b>uncal.</b> BP, Tor at-Tareeq in the Wadi al-Hasa area of Jordan, with radiocarbon dates between 16 900 and 15 580 <b>uncal.</b> BP, and Tor Sageer, also in the Wadi al-Hasa area, with radiocarbon dates between 22 590 and 20 330 BP. This new evidence clearly documents the use of the microburin technique in the inland Levant during the earliest phases of the Epipaleolithic. Thus, its presence at sites such as Wadi Madamagh and Tor Hamar cannot necessarily be used to link these sites to the Mushabian Complex, a fact also noted by Byrd".|$|E

50|$|Since the {{tentorium}} {{is a hard}} structure, {{if there}} is an expansion of the volume of the brain or its surrounding matter above the tentorium, such as because of a tumour or bleeding, the brain can get pushed down partly through the tentorium. This is called herniation and will often cause an enlarged pupil on the affected side, due to pressure on the oculomotor nerve. Tentorial herniation is a serious symptom, especially since the brainstem is likely to be compressed as well if the intracranial pressure rises further. A common type of herniation is <b>uncal</b> herniation.|$|E
50|$|Kernohan's notch is a {{cerebral}} peduncle indentation associated with {{some forms of}} transtentorial herniation (<b>uncal</b> herniation). It is a secondary condition caused by a primary injury on the opposite hemisphere of the brain. Kernohan's notch is an ipsilateral condition, in that a left-sided primary lesion (in which Kernohan's notch {{would be on the}} right side) evokes motor impairment in {{the left side of the}} body and a right-sided primary injury evokes motor impairment in the right side of the body. The seriousness of Kernohan's notch varies depending on the primary problem causing it, which may range from benign brain tumors to advanced subdural hematoma.|$|E
5000|$|Decerebrate posturing {{indicates}} {{brain stem}} damage, specifically damage {{below the level}} of the red nucleus (e.g. mid-collicular lesion). It is exhibited by people with lesions or compression in the midbrain and lesions in the cerebellum. Decerebrate posturing is commonly seen in pontine strokes. A patient with decorticate posturing may begin to show decerebrate posturing, or may go from one form of posturing to the other. [...] Progression from decorticate posturing to decerebrate posturing is often indicative of <b>uncal</b> (transtentorial) or tonsilar brain herniation. Activation of gamma motor neurons is thought to be important in decerebrate rigidity due to studies in animals showing that dorsal root transection eliminates decerebrate rigidity symptoms.|$|E

50|$|Concussion {{temporarily}} {{changes the}} brain's function.It {{is believed that}} the brain is left in a vulnerable state after concussion and that a second blow is linked to SIS. The actual mechanism behind the catastrophic brain swelling is controversial. A second injury during this time is thought to unleash a series of metabolic events within the brain.Changes indicative of SIS may begin occurring in the injured brain within 15 seconds of the second concussion. Pathophysiological changes in SIS can include a loss of autoregulation of the brain's blood vessels, which causes them to become congested. The vessels dilate, greatly increasing their diameter and leading to a large increase in cerebral blood flow. Progressive cerebral edema may also occur. The increase of blood and brain volume within the skull causes a rapid and severe increase in intracranial pressure, which can in turn cause <b>uncal</b> and cerebellar brain herniation, a disastrous and potentially fatal condition in which the brain is squeezed past structures within the skull.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide {{mathematical}} foundations of a graph transformation language, called <b>UnCAL,</b> using categorical semantics of type theory and fixed points. About twenty years ago, Buneman et al. developed a graph database query language UnQL on the top of a functional meta-language <b>UnCAL</b> for describing and manipulating graphs. Recently, the functional programming community has shown renewed interest in <b>UnCAL,</b> because it provides an efficient graph transformation language which is useful for various applications, such as bidirectional computation. In order to make <b>UnCAL</b> more flexible and fruitful for further extensions and applications, in this paper, we give a more conceptual understanding of <b>UnCAL</b> using categorical semantics. Our general interest {{of this paper is}} to clarify what is the algebra of <b>UnCAL.</b> Thus, we give an equational axiomatisation and categorical semantics of <b>UnCAL,</b> both of which are new. We show that the axiomatisation is complete for the original bisimulation semantics of <b>UnCAL.</b> Moreover, we provide a clean characterisation of the computation mechanism of <b>UnCAL</b> called "structural recursion on graphs" using our categorical semantics. We show a concrete model of <b>UnCAL</b> given by the lambdaG-calculus, which shows an interesting connection to lazy functional programming. Comment: 53 pages, to appear in MSC...|$|E
