The band released two albums in Australia before releasing {{their first}} international effort, High Voltage with vocalist Bon Scott, bassist Mark Evans and drummer Phil Rudd.

Club wrote that [...] "much of this episode {{felt like a}} very deliberate throwback to season one, in some very good ways", and IGN's Robert Canning said that [...] "the overarching storylines on Glee have become far more engaging than {{what we saw in}} the first half of the season". John Kubicek of BuddyTV stated that the episode [...] "does a lot of things right when it comes to the plot", and Billboard Rae Votta described the plot as [...] "consistent and well managed, with believable motivation, response and action all around". However, Jen Chaney of The Washington Post wrote that the episode [...] "brought more narrative developments that didn’t make sense", and Rolling Stone Erica Futterman stated that aside from Martin's scenes, [...] "the rest of the episode found <b>us</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> scatterbrained plot territory". Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times liked the episode and described it as [...] "the kind that makes you belly-laugh and chortle and snicker despite your better judgment".|$|E

Therefore, digging down through this pyramid takes <b>us</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> time. [...] The first temple was begun by the Aztecs the year after they founded the city, and the pyramid was rebuilt six times.

But the policemen pulled us off and threw <b>us</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the car. They pushed the mothers away and drove off, while our mothers were chasing the car, running and crying after us.

Aya told Ritchie Yorke of The Sunday Mail that the difficulties with the label meant the band was unable to maximise its opportunities. He said: [...] "We decided that we'd rather move on now and look at some other possibilities while we're still drawing big crowds ... Unfortunately, the last album was only heard on Triple J and some community stations, so we didn't really reach the mainstream with it. This was despite our hopes that the album might have taken us to another level. It was given great reviews and we really thought the music got <b>us</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> touch with the fans.

2500|$|The Helderberg Plateau {{comprises}} {{a series}} of limestones of early Devonian age {{and is one of}} the most fossiliferous regions in the United States. [...] The park is a window in to New York's geological history, as the rocks here take <b>us</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> time hundreds of millions of years. In the 1800's, some of the world's most renowned pioneering geologists, such as Charles Lyell and Amos Eaton, visited this location due to its robust fossil assemblage. During this time James Hall (paleontologist), New York's first state paleontologist, frequently visited the Heldeberg Escarpment, making observations and documenting the unique fossil assemblage. [...] In the 1930's, Winifred Goldring, New York's state paleontologist and the first female state paleontologist in the nation, continued the work of pioneering geologists and in 1933 wrote a guide to Thacher State Park that is still in use to this day.|$|E
