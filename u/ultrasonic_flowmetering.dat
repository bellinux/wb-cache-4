The velocity range was 5. 5 fps - 25 fps. The triple midradius chord configuration performed extremely well, with maximum errors of 1. 3, and 2. 0 percent of reading, in the normal and abnormal flows, respectively. The double tilted diameter configuration gave maximum errors of 7. 2, and 9. 3 percent of reading in the normal and abnormal flows, respectively. Recommendations for field testing of the two ultrasonic configurations are made. A numerical simulation of <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>flowmetering</b> in an abnormal flow using single, double, and triple midradius chords, and a double tilted diameter was conducted prior to the experimental tests. The simulation showed that the triple midradius chord and double tilted diameter were, respectively, the most accurate and second most accurate of the four trajectories. An amplitude difference between the acoustic signals received at the upstream and downstream transducers, in flowing air, was measured. This amplitude difference is believed to be caused by flow effects. A two-dimensional model was developed to explain the amplitude difference in terms of focusing of the downstream ultrasonic beam and defocusing of the upstream beam, due to velocity gradients. The focusing and defocusing predicted by the model was found to be too small to explain the amplitude difference, however...|$|E

ABSTRACT: An <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>flowmeter</b> could be advantageous over a differential pressure pneumotachograph having a constant error in varying conditions. The in vitro accuracy of ultrasonic tidal volume (VT) estimates for ventilated infants were evaluated. Flow linearity and frequency response were tested, as was the influence of humidity and oxygen content on the accuracy of VT estimates. The linearity was within the 5 % limits between- 350 and 350 mL. sec- 1 and was not affected {{by the presence of}} an endotracheal tube (ET). The frequency response was flat and unaffected by an ET up to 4. 5 Hz. The VT in the range 7 – 100 mL, in air showed a mean error of 0. 1 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) - 0. 2 – 0. 4 %) with a maximum and minimum of 6. 5 and- 3. 5 % respectively. Humidity did not affect accuracy. After calibration in air, the maximal mean error for measurements in pure oxygen was 3. 0 % (95 % CI 1. 9 – 4. 1 %). Repeated measurements over 5. 5 h had a mean error of 0. 4 % (95 % CI- 0. 7 – 0. 1 %).

Sub-optimal adjustment of the mainstream molar mass (MM) signal for temperature and external deadspace may lead to analysis errors in infants with critically small tidal volume changes during breathing. We measured expiratory temperature in human infants at 5 weeks of age and examined the influence of temperature and deadspace changes on FRC results with computer simulation modeling. A new analysis method with optimized temperature and deadspace settings was then derived, tested for robustness to analysis errors and compared with the previously used analysis methods. Temperature in the facemask was higher and variations of deadspace volumes larger than previously assumed. Both showed considerable impact upon FRC and LCI results with high variability when obtained with the previously used analysis model. Using the measured temperature we optimized model parameters and tested a newly derived analysis method, which was found to be more robust to variations in deadspace.
