In 1649 was published the catalogue of the Royal Music Library of King John IV of Portugal containing the best known books of cittern music from foreign composers of {{the sixteenth and seventeenth}} centuries, in which the complexity and technical difficulty of the pieces allow <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that there had been highly skilled players in Portugal.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary with Hume, but {{critical}} of Hume's scepticism, a so-called Scottish school of Common Sense formed, whose basic principle was enunciated by its founder and greatest figure, Thomas Reid:If {{there are certain}} principles, as I think there are, which the constitution of our nature leads <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe,</b> and which we are under a necessity {{to take for granted}} in the common concerns of life, without being able to give a reason for them — these are what we call the principles of common sense; and what is manifestly contrary to them, is what we call absurd.|$|E
25|$|With {{the conquest}} of Italy, {{prepared}} viae were extended from Rome and its vicinity to outlying municipalities, sometimes overlying earlier roads. Building viae was a military responsibility and thus came {{under the jurisdiction of}} a consul. The process had a military name, viam munire, as though the via were a fortification. Municipalities, however, were responsible for their own roads, which the Romans called viae vicinales. The beauty and grandeur of the roads might tempt <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that any Roman citizen could use them for free, but this was not the case. Tolls abounded, especially at bridges. Often they were collected at the city gate. Freight costs were made heavier still by import and export taxes. These were only the charges for using the roads. Costs of services on the journey went up from there.|$|E

25|$|Vallée also {{proposes that}} a {{secondary}} {{aspect of the}} UFO phenomenon involves human manipulation by humans. Witnesses of UFO phenomena undergo a manipulative and staged spectacle, meant to alter their belief system, and eventually, influence human society by suggesting alien intervention from outer space. The ultimate motivation for this deception is probably a projected major change of human society, the breaking down of old belief systems and the implementation of new ones. Vallée states that the evidence, if carefully analyzed, suggests an underlying plan for the deception of mankind by means of unknown, highly advanced methods. Vallée states that {{it is highly unlikely}} that governments actually conceal alien evidence, as the popular myth suggests. Rather, it is much more likely that that is exactly what the manipulators want <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe.</b> Vallée feels the entire subject of UFOs is mystified by charlatans and science fiction. He advocates a stronger and more serious involvement of science in the UFO research and debate. Only this can reveal the true nature of the UFO phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|In 1963 Benoit Mandelbrot {{analyzed}} the variations of cotton prices on a time series starting in 1900. There were two important findings. First, price movements {{had very little}} to do with a normal distribution in which the bulk of the observations lies close to the mean (68% of the data are within one standard deviation). Instead, the data showed a great frequency of extreme variations. Second, price variations followed patterns that were indifferent to scale: the curve described by price changes for a single day was similar to a month’s curve. Surprisingly, these patterns of self-similarity were present during the entire period 1900-1960, a violent epoch that had seen a Great Depression and two world wars. Mandelbrot used his fractal theory to explain the presence of extreme events in Wall Street. In 2004 he published his book on the “misbehavior” of financial markets - The (Mis)behavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Risk, Ruin, and Reward. The basic idea that relates fractals to financial markets is that the probability of experiencing extreme fluctuations (like the ones triggered by herd behavior) is greater than what conventional wisdom wants <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe.</b> This of course delivers a more accurate vision of risk in the world of finance. The central objective in financial markets is to maximize income for a given level of risk. Standard models for this are based on the premise that the probability of extreme variations of asset prices is very low.|$|E

She {{was asked to}} make three demonstration recordings for Charles Koppelman, chairman of EMI Records. After reviewing them, Koppelman declined a crossover attempt, believing Selena should first strengthen her fan base. In a 2007 interview, Behar spoke about the difficulty of recording Selena's English-language debut. He said EMI [...] "had let all of <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that she would record in English, and it just wasn't materializing for whatever reason".

500|$|Rather than {{accepting}} the fugitive slave narratives without question, Blassingame admits to scrutinizing his {{reading of the}} texts. He notes that arguments {{against the use of}} these autobiographies used by historians revolve around reliability: [...] "Many historians refuse to use these accounts because they have felt the fugitive, as the primary sufferer in the institution, was unable to give an objective account of bondage." [...] Still, Blassingame defends his reliance on autobiographies, noting, [...] "The portrait of the institution of slavery which emerges from the narratives is not the simple picture of hell on earth that most historians have led <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> they contain. Instead, the fugitives' plantations are peopled with the same range of heroes and villains, black and white, which one generally finds in the human race."

500|$|If The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock, Gerontion, The Waste Land, and The Hollow Men are Eliot's Inferno, Ash-Wednesday {{seems to}} be Purgatorio, and the Four Quartets {{seems to be}} Paradiso. The Four Quartets {{abandons}} time, as per Dante's conception of the Empyrean, and allows for opposites to co-exist together. As such, {{people are able to}} experience God directly as long as they know that they cannot fully understand or comprehend him. Eliot tries to create a new system, according to Denis Donoghue, in which he is able to describe a Christianity that is not restricted by previous views that have fallen out of favour in modern society or contradicted by science. Eliot reasoned that he is not supposed to preach a theological system as a poet, but expose the reader to the ideas of religion. As Eliot stated in 1947: [...] "if we learn to read poetry properly, the poet never persuades <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> anything" [...] and [...] "What we learn from Dante, or the Bhagavad-Gita, or any other religious poetry is {{what it feels like to}} believe that religion." ...|$|E
500|$|Richard Schickel of Time {{magazine}} praised Zorro as {{a summer}} blockbuster which paid tribute to the classical Hollywood swashbuckler films. [...] "The action in this movie, most of which {{takes the form of}} spectacular stunt work performed by real, as opposed to digitized, people," [...] Schickel stated, [...] "is motivated by simple, powerful emotions of an old-fashioned and rather melodramatic nature." [...] Zorro exceeded Roger Ebert's expectations, who was surprised by the screenplay's display of traditional film craftsmanship. [...] "It's a reminder of the time when stunts and special effects were integrated into stories, {{rather than the other way}} around." [...] Ebert later called The Mask of Zorro [...] "probably the best Zorro movie ever made." [...] Despite giving credit to Anthony Hopkins for his masculine portrayal of an older Zorro, Mick LaSalle, writing in the San Francisco Chronicle, found that the actor's [...] "performance presents a slight problem: The film asks <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that no one has figured out that Zorro and his real-life persona are the same person, even though they are the only guys in Mexico who talk with a British accent." ...|$|E

[...] Benigno wrote that it was [...] "great", but added that it was [...] "not much of a stretch for Amber Riley to hit this one". Berk praised her [...] "amazing voice" [...] and gave the performance four stars out of five, and Goldberg characterized the rendition as [...] "flawless". Other reviewers were more critical, including VanDerWerff, who said that this was the only song in the episode that [...] "really didn't work". Slezak felt that the arrangement used was not distinct enough from the original, though he gave the performance a [...] "B+", as did West, who wrote, [...] "Mercedes looked fantastic and carried herself well, and her voice was as strong as ever but it felt a little lacking." [...] In her [...] "Maria-off" [...] with Rachel, Benigno said they [...] "both kill it", characterized it as [...] "easy but fun", and gave it an [...] "A−", as did Slezak and West, the latter of whom [...] "didn't feel that Mercedes was the clear winner" [...] but thought both singers were [...] "fantastic". Kubicek thought that [...] "Mercedes clearly won" [...] and Flandez maintained that she [...] "clearly outshone her rival", and continued, [...] "You just believe so much of what she sings." [...] Berk agreed, and contrasted the two singers with his rating scale of one to five stars: [...] "Two stars for Rachel, who sang this like Barry Manilow; four for Mercedes, who sang this like she lived it." [...] Futterman had a slightly different take: [...] "Rachel puts on a diva front, but inside she's scared and nervous, while Mercedes is just a diva." [...] However, Hyman thought that the two [...] "were evenly matched", while Canning and Billboard Rae Votta both thought Rachel was the victor; Votta stated, [...] "While the show wants <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> otherwise, Rachel clearly outsang Mercedes". [...] "It's All Over" [...] from Dreamgirls received the most enthusiastic commentary, including an [...] "A+" [...] from West, who wrote [...] "Mercedes was at her best in this performance", a sentiment echoed by Benigno when he awarded the song an [...] "A". Hyman called it [...] "pretty awesome" [...] and Flandez a [...] "cleverly amusing take", while Futterman said Mercedes [...] "fully embraces her inner Effie White" [...] and that the song was [...] "on par with the best of Glee's Broadway songs in terms of plot relevancy and vocal arrangements". She also praised [...] "the first group showtune the New Directions have done" [...] and added, [...] "we want more". Votta characterized it as [...] "a flawless fantasy homage" [...] and stated, [...] "It's the perfect use of the non-realism of [...] "Glee" [...] and the power of musical theater to express a storyline". Kubicek agreed it was [...] "like a real musical" [...] in these regards and praised Mike's short solo, and West liked the segment where Santana confronts Mercedes in the number. Slezak was not enthusiastic about the rendition, and wrote that he wished that the [...] "scene gelled better than it did", and questioned why Mercedes was the character Effie while all the other members of New Directions were themselves. He gave the number a [...] "C+".|$|E
