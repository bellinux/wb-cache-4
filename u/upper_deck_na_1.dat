25|$|From March 2002 to December 2008, Konami's trading {{cards were}} {{distributed}} in territories outside of Asia by The <b>Upper</b> <b>Deck</b> Company. In December 2008, Konami {{filed a lawsuit}} against <b>Upper</b> <b>Deck</b> alleging that it had distributed inauthentic Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG cards made without Konami's authorization. <b>Upper</b> <b>Deck</b> also sued Konami alleging breach of contract and slander. A few months later, a federal court in Los Angeles issued an injunction preventing <b>Upper</b> <b>Deck</b> from acting as the authorized distributor and requiring it to remove the Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG from <b>Upper</b> <b>Deck's</b> website. In December 2009, the court decided that <b>Upper</b> <b>Deck</b> was liable for counterfeiting Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG cards, and it dismissed <b>Upper</b> <b>Deck's</b> countersuit against Konami. Konami is the manufacturer and distributor of the Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG. It runs Regional and National tournaments and continues to release new Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG card products.|$|R

50|$|As {{originally}} built, {{the park}} was criticized by many fans because of {{the height of the}} <b>upper</b> <b>deck.</b> The original architect, HOK Sport (now Populous), wanted to eliminate the overhang problems present in many stadiums built since the 1970s. With this in mind, the <b>upper</b> <b>deck</b> was set back over the lower deck, and the stands rose fairly gradually. While it gave nearly every seat in the upper level an unobstructed view of the field, it also created one of the highest <b>upper</b> <b>decks</b> in baseball. The first row of seats in the <b>upper</b> <b>deck</b> at the new stadium is as far from the field as the highest row of seats in the <b>upper</b> <b>deck</b> at the old stadium. Due to the field being practically at street level, the original <b>upper</b> <b>deck</b> made the park look like a cookie-cutter stadium from the outside. Fans sitting in this area didn't get much chance for relief, as {{it is one of the}} few parks in Major League Baseball that do not allow fans sitting in the <b>upper</b> <b>deck</b> to venture anywhere else in the park, e.g. lower deck concourse.|$|R

The <b>upper</b> <b>deck</b> had twenty-four 60-pounder guns and two long 36-pounder chase guns. Two 3-pood shell guns were mounted fore and aft on revolving platforms. In 1862 her armament was revised and two 60-pounder and the two long 36-pounder guns on her <b>upper</b> <b>deck</b> were removed. Four years later, it was rearranged with two 60-pounders moved from her <b>upper</b> <b>deck</b> to the lower deck and two long 36-pounders moved from the lower <b>deck</b> to the <b>upper</b> <b>deck.</b>|$|R
50|$|One major {{innovation}} of the multi-purpose parks was the cantilevered <b>upper</b> <b>deck.</b> In earlier ballparks, {{the columns}} {{used to support}} the <b>upper</b> <b>decks</b> obstructed the view from some seats in the lower <b>deck.</b> The <b>upper</b> <b>decks</b> were extended upwards and the columns removed. However, even though the extension counterbalanced some of the weight, the <b>upper</b> <b>decks</b> could no longer extend {{as close to the}} field and had to be moved back. Also, the roofs could no longer be as large, and often only covered the top 15 or so rows. This exposed fans to the elements.|$|R
