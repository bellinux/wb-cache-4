5|$|In a 2011 study, {{researchers}} {{tested to}} see if people would willingly choose between instant and delayed gratification by offering them a set amount of (hypothetical) money that they could receive presently, or telling them they could wait a month for more money. Results suggested that willingness to delay gratification depended {{on the amount of}} money being offered, but also showed wide individual variation in the threshold of later reward that was motivating enough to forgo the immediate reward. The subjective value of a reward can also stem from the way one describes the potential reward. As prospect theory states, people are heavily loss-averse. People tend to value a commodity more when it is considered to be something that can be lost or given <b>up</b> <b>than</b> when it is evaluated as a potential gain.|$|E

The designer does this because it is usually more practical to make a dam of material essentially just piled <b>up</b> <b>than</b> to make the material stick together against vertical tension.|$|E
25|$|Operation Battery was {{the name}} given to the amphibious assault planned by the naval service and Givati Brigade against an Egyptian {{artillery}} battery in Isdud. The naval service could not mount such an operation independently as its nascent marine force had been almost entirely destroyed in land combat in Operation Death to the Invader. Plans had to be changed as more infantry soldiers showed <b>up</b> <b>than</b> expected, and an actual landing craft was used instead of boats as planned. The landing craft's crew {{had no knowledge of}} the vessel's specifications and {{did not know how to}} properly operate it.|$|E

25|$|The Coppermine Expedition sailed from Gravesend on 23 May 1819 on a Hudson's Bay Company supply ship, {{after three}} months of planning, and {{immediately}} hit a note of farce. The ship had stopped briefly off the Norfolk coast, where George Back had business to attend to, but before he had returned a favourable wind blew up and the ship sailed off, leaving Back to make his own way to their next stop in Orkney by stagecoach and ferry. A more serious problem arose in Stromness when the expedition, now reunited with Back, attempted to hire local boatmen to act as manhaulers for {{the first part of the}} trek across Canada. The people of Stromness were far less keen to sign <b>up</b> <b>than</b> the navy had anticipated, and only four men were recruited, and even they agreed to go only as far as Fort Chipewyan on Lake Athabasca.|$|E
25|$|Polluted {{groundwater}} is less visible, {{but more}} difficult to clean <b>up,</b> <b>than</b> pollution in rivers and lakes. Groundwater pollution most often results from improper disposal of wastes on land. Major sources include industrial and household chemicals and garbage landfills, industrial waste lagoons, tailings and process wastewater from mines, oil field brine pits, leaking underground oil storage tanks and pipelines, sewage sludge and septic systems. Polluted groundwater is mapped by sampling soils and groundwater near suspected or known sources of pollution, {{to determine the extent}} of the pollution, and to aid in the design of groundwater remediation systems. Preventing groundwater pollution near potential sources such as landfills requires lining the bottom of a landfill with watertight materials, collecting any leachate with drains, and keeping rainwater off any potential contaminants, along with regular monitoring of nearby groundwater to verify that contaminants have not leaked into the groundwater.|$|E
25|$|Fred Tupper (Neil Crone)– The local loudmouth and {{the host}} of a talk show on the local radio station, he often equates Muslims to terrorists who want to take over the country. However, at times he finds himself in the awkward {{position}} of siding with the Muslim community, as evidenced in the first season. A flashback episode revealed that his distrust of Muslims stems more from an unpleasant encounter with Baber than from any deeply held prejudices. His radio rants are primarily a ratings-grabbing persona; while he can be a blowhard jerk on and off the air, he treats pretty much everyone with equal condescension (not just Muslims). By season 3, it is revealed that his objectionable comments {{have more to do with}} habit and keeping ratings <b>up,</b> <b>than</b> any active dislike of Muslims. In fact, when he believes he is dying, he is downright friendly to everyone (including Muslims) and almost declares his love to Fatima. She graciously allows him his dignity when he claims it is in fact her hummus that he loves. Fred Tupper is also a divorcee.|$|E

500|$|Filming for {{the pilot}} began in March, in Vancouver, under the working title Clubhouse. Hawley {{directed}} the episode, with Dana Gonzales serving as cinematographer. Gonzales referenced Kubrick, Malick, and Paolo Sorrentino as influences on the filming style of the show, {{and said it was}} [...] "more about building from the ground <b>up</b> <b>than</b> leveraging the look of [...] universe", with Gonzales not having seen any of the X-Men films. With the series order, the rest of the first season was set to start filming in August 2016, also in Vancouver. Gonzales served as cinematographer on another four episodes of the season, with Craig Wrobleski taking on the role for the other three episode. Both cinematographers previously worked with Hawley on Fargo. Filming for the season was completed by the end of November 2016.|$|E
500|$|Built in 1818, the Gurdon Bill Store is a [...] by [...] -story clapboarded store. The {{walls extend}} higher <b>up</b> <b>than</b> the ceiling to an attic for {{additional}} storage space. The wood-shingled gable roof {{also has a}} smaller pent roof on the front facade that projects about [...] beyond the wall, which is unusual in New England architecture. The foundation of the store is built upon fieldstone and has stone blocks above the ground; the store has a full cellar. The main facade has two large twelve-by-twelve light sliding sash windows {{on the left side}} that can be covered with three-part batten shutters. The main door is a Dutch door with a plain frame and to its right is a smaller six-by-six sash window without a batten shutter. The rear facade is plain and devoid of any windows.

The element of an estranged father-son relationship had previously appeared in Big Fish, similarly directed by Burton and written by August. Warner Bros. and the director held differences over the characterizations of Charlie Bucket and Willy Wonka. The studio wanted to entirely delete Mr. Bucket and make Willy Wonka the idyllic father figure Charlie had longed for his entire life. Burton believed that Wonka {{would not be a}} good father, finding the character similar to a recluse. Burton said, [...] "In some ways, he's more screwed <b>up</b> <b>than</b> the kids." [...] Warner Bros. also wanted Charlie to be a , but Burton resisted the characterization. He wanted Charlie to be an average child who would be in the background and not get in trouble.|$|E

500|$|The [...] season saw teams running [...] "off-throttle blown diffusers", {{which created}} {{downforce}} by forcing fuel through {{the engine to}} produce exhaust gases and directing it over the diffuser when the driver was not applying the throttle. This concept was originally banned in incremental phases, with increasingly restrictive rules on what teams could and could not do, with a full ban to be applied from the 2011 British Grand Prix onwards. However, the incremental ban was controversial, with several teams applying for and receiving permission to circumvent the total ban. After discussion between the FIA and engine manufacturers, the original regulations were restored, with the full ban delayed until 2012. The regulations in 2012 governed {{the design of the}} exhaust with the teams agreeing to strict constraints on the position of the exhaust tailpipe. This resulted in the exhaust exiting the bodywork much higher <b>up</b> <b>than</b> in 2011, and no longer {{in the vicinity of the}} diffuser. Several teams, including Williams and Mercedes used the Young Driver Tests in Abu Dhabi as an opportunity to test parts for the 2012 season in the face of the ban. In October 2011, a clarification to the amended rules was issued, effectively banning [...] "exotic" [...] engine maps; in November, further amendments were introduced, completely banning the practice of blowing exhaust gasses over parts of the car to improve downforce, following a bid by several teams to allow it under certain conditions. Further amendments were made in February 2012 when Mercedes alerted the FIA to a loophole in the regulations that would allow teams to continue using a partially blown diffuser. The FIA responded by re-writing the software governing the engine's Electronic Control Unit to close the loophole.|$|E
