We show that stylolite growth in a rock with a <b>uniform</b> <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> produces different patterns than stylolite growth in a rock with a bimodal grain size distribution. Strong pinning of large heterogeneities produce stylolite structures that are dominated by pronounced teeth, whereas a <b>uniform</b> <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> leads to spikes and a roughness that shows variable wavelengths. We compare the simulated stylolites with natural examples and show that the model can reproduce the real structures.

In a set of 24 simulations we vary the main principle stress on the stylolite in order to test if our model can reproduce the analytically derived stress-scaling proposed by Schmittbuhl et al. (2004). We compare the calculated stresses with the applied stresses and show that the numerical model and the analytical solution are in good agreement.

Both linear analyses show morphological effects due to the spatially varying <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> as well as due to spatially varying bed roughness. The spatial variation of the bed roughness should, according to the analyses, have a counteracting morphological effect in regard to the morphological effects of the spatially variation of the <b>grain</b> <b>size.</b> Application of spatially varying bed roughness resulted for Olesen's experiment in effects according to free and forced excitation.

In that case the dominant <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> for computing depth of scour at foundations at stratified bed conditions is mean diameter of the second layer or next, where the scour stops. To calculate depth of scour near hydraulic structures in flow using <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> d 50 on the top of the river bed and not to take into account stratification of the river bed, can lead to wrong results and considerable damages and losses...|$|R
40|$|DE 19919613 A UPAB: 20001219 NOVELTY - Ultra-finely {{crystalline}} {{silicon nitride}} powder production, by phase transformation of amorphous silicon nitride powder in a liquid phase-forming additive melt under a non-oxidizing atmosphere, is new. USE - For producing ultra-finely crystalline silicon nitride powder useful as starting material for manufacturing sintered non-oxide ceramic components for machine and plant construction, e. g. {{in the vehicle}} industry, as wear parts, as bearings and for knives and other cutting tools. ADVANTAGE - The process produces a powder {{in which the individual}} crystallites have a narrow size range so that a <b>uniform</b> narrow <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> distribution is obtained in the finished sintered product, the finished product exhibiting high strength and fracture toughness, low wear and a very low coefficient of friction...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose to}} test the {{hypothesis}} that heterogeneity of coastal subaerial and subaqueous morphology on many scales is correlated with heterogeneity in surface sediments, which influences the morphodynamic feedback. OBJECTIVES The specific objectives of this work are to: develop and integrate a suite of sensors for efficiently measuring morphology and surface sediment <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> distribution within the surf zone, obtain, modify, and evaluate ONR’s surf zone crawler as a platform for nearshore measurements, test the sensors in the field and obtain measurements of the temporal and spatial variability of sediments and bedforms investigate heterogeneity of morphology {{in the context of the}} local sedimentological conditions. APPROACH Historically, it has been assumed by most nearshore models that beaches are <b>uniform</b> in <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> and relative smooth. Recent studies have found that this is not the case. Ripples and megaripples are observed to be ubiquitous (Nielsen 1981, Gallagher et al. 2003, amoung many others) and to depend on <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> (Ardhuin et al. 2002, Trembanis et al. 2004), cross-shore sand bar migration is better modeled when small changes in <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> are considered (Gallagher et al. 1998), <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> is observed to vary in and around beah cusps, rip current systems, ripples scour depressions and erosional hot spot...|$|R
