5|$|In {{the case}} of '4 Minutes', Tim had a vision from the {{beginning}} of how things should go, especially sonically... When I opened up the session of '4 Minutes', there was so much going on that I knew right away that the hard part would be {{to make sure that the}} vocals would cut through and were right in the pocket. Beginning with working on the vocals was the only way to achieve this. After that I formed all the other parts around the vocals. The other challenge was to make sure that everything in the track sounded clear and that you could hear every instrument, every syllable, every breath. Also, I do almost always work linear in time on a track. It's easier, because when you're done, you're done. So I keep working on section after section, <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> to the end of the track and then I know the whole mix is pretty close.|$|E
500|$|Though DeLonge would joke {{around at}} shows, {{as he would}} with Blink-182, the mood was much different. [...] "With Blink, I cant wait <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> done playing a song so I can say {{something}} stupid. With this band I hardly talk at all," [...] he told Las Vegas Weekly. He expounded upon this in another interview: [...] "It's a much more powerful, emotional experience than it is with Blink. To play songs and have them showcased to where it represents what this kind of music is all about is a welcome experience. It's not about anything but the music itself." ...|$|E
500|$|By July, Allenby was [...] "very {{anxious to}} make a move in September," [...] when he aimed to capture [...] Tulkarm, Nablus and the Jisr ed Damieh bridge across the Jordan River. He stated, [...] "The {{possession}} by the Turks of the road Nablus–Jisr ed Damie–Es Salt is of great advantage to them; and, <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> it, I can't occupy Es Salt with my troops or the Arabs." [...] He hoped the capture of this important Ottoman line of communication from Nablus along the Wadi Fara to the Jordan River at Jisr ed Damieh and on to Es Salt would also [...] "encourage both my own new Indian troops and my Arab Allies." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As soon as possible," [...] said Miss Ponsonby. [...] "Stephen {{was going}} away next week, {{but he says}} he will wait <b>until</b> <b>I</b> can <b>get</b> ready." ...|$|R
5000|$|He made a brief media {{appearance}} on March 30: [...] "I'll take things slowly <b>until</b> <b>I</b> can <b>get</b> through {{a day without}} shaking legs and a pounding heart," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess that's {{what you}} want, but I haven't {{finished}} the Lewis yet. Reckoned I'd wait <b>until</b> <b>I</b> could <b>get</b> {{a bit of}} horseshoe iron for the wedge when the new stores come along." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "In the Dark" [...] was {{directed}} by Ethan Lader. Dev enlisted Lader to make the video as he regularly makes videos for her and The Cataracs. Lader originally contacted her with ideas for the clip, and she soon replied with what she would want in the video. She said, [...] "So we did that back and forth, which he always does with me <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> my point across. ... and then we met up and we got both of our ideas and feelings across. I wanted to be sexy and dark like the song is, in a really interesting way, and we pulled it off, I think." [...] The video was filmed in Los Angeles, California in late-April 2011, just before Dev joined Usher as the opening act for his OMG Tour. Dev took {{more control over the}} [...] "In the Dark" [...] video than previous video shoots as she used to let the director [...] "take a little bit of control" [...] when she was inexperienced in the process. In an interview with Idolator, Dev elaborated on the video's concept, stating that she wanted a dark feel similar to Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland: [...] "I wanted the video to be sexy as well. I wanted it to reflect all the dark aspects of the song, and initially we went in thinking that we'd have an Alice in Wonderland/Tim Burton type of feel." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Plot It Yourself (chapter 13), Wolfe {{makes an}} {{unprecedented}} vow after Archie tells him the killer they seek has killed again. Wolfe hits the desk with his fist, bellows {{in a language}} Archie does not understand, then coldly orders Fritz away when he enters with the beer: [...] "Take it back. I shall drink no beer <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> my fingers around that creature's throat. And I shall eat no meat." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically {{the song}} is about letting loose, being as wild as can be, while she asks ladies to [...] "whip their hair" [...] and [...] "shake haters off". The lyrics have motivational undertones, {{speaking}} of self-love and assurance, and referring to letting your hair down as a representation of this in parts like the line, [...] "Keep fighting <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> there, when I'm down and I feel like giving up/I whip my hair back and forth, I whip it, I whip it real good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say," [...] he said, {{with sudden}} fierceness, [...] "don't you go fooling around that slide <b>until</b> after <b>I</b> <b>get</b> {{the trees in}} and rooted. It's mighty dangerous, and I sure can't afford to lose you now." ...|$|R
6000|$|Clavering smiled. [...] "I {{am afraid}} your wishes wouldn't go quite as far {{in this case}} as they {{generally}} do with me. You and Miss Schuyler can't stay here <b>until</b> <b>I</b> could <b>get</b> a sleigh from Allonby's." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not quite," [...] he answered. [...] "We have thirty-eight shillings. That {{will take}} us back to London, and find us rooms somewhere for the night. We must scrape along somehow <b>until</b> <b>I</b> can <b>get</b> to Deane's offices." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait here <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> back," [...] said Arnold Baxter {{to his son}} and to {{the coach}} driver, and then hurried inside of the building.|$|E
60|$|I got sunburnt and a dizzy {{headache}} and almost seasick. Yet {{the day was}} pleasant. The first few days are always hard, <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> broken in.|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall {{remain as}} I am, Mr. Muir, <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> some tidings of my father. He will {{return in the}} course of the next ten days." ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{the risk}} of seeming prolix, I must say a few more words on this matter. I have special reasons for it. <b>Until</b> <b>I</b> can <b>get</b> you to [...] "let your {{thoughts}} play freely" [...] round this question of the superposition of soils and rocks, {{there will be no}} use in my going on with these papers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Knock off my {{head with}} little apples," [...] he {{declared}} emphatically, striking the fist of one hand into the palm of the other, [...] "if those two men ever escape me! I'll stay here to get them if it takes {{the rest of my}} natural life, and if <b>I</b> don't <b>get</b> them, then <b>I</b> promise you I'll live unnaturally long or <b>until</b> <b>I</b> do <b>get</b> them, or my name's not Charley Le Grant!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hold on, a moment, sir, <b>until</b> <b>I</b> can <b>get</b> this awkward {{glass to}} bear on it.--Ay--now I have her--she's but a speck, at the best--royals and head of top-gallant-sails--no, sir, by George, it's our own cutter, the Active, with her square-sail set, and the heads of her lower sails just rising. I know her {{by the way she}} carries her gaff." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've got all {{the food}} I'm going to take," [...] Jimmy rejoined. [...] "I can load up at Kelshope, but you must wait <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> back." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{spoke in}} a voice in which Lane's ears {{detected}} insincerity. [...] "Be seated, and wait <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> my book," [...] he continued, and left the room.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll hunt that fox <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> him," [...] he said. You see, he didn't know {{anything}} about old Granny Fox; he thought Bowser was following Reddy Fox.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} more {{fortunate}} than I deserved," [...] Anna answered, [...] "but I only meant to stay upon the music hall stage <b>until</b> <b>I</b> could <b>get</b> something better. <b>I</b> am rehearsing now for a new play at the 'Garrick' and I have quite {{made up my mind}} to try and make some sort of position for myself as an actress." ...|$|R
60|$|Thanks to my adventurous past life, I {{have got}} the habit of {{deciding}} quickly in serious emergencies of all sorts. In the present emergency--as I saw it--there were two things to be done. One, to go instantly with help to Browndown: the other, to keep the knowledge {{of what had happened}} from Lucilla <b>until</b> <b>I</b> could <b>get</b> back again, and prepare her for the discovery.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lovely, {{perfectly}} lovely--Pari-Sulay," [...] she panted. [...] "I shall buy it. I'll {{write to}} the Commissioner to-night. And {{the site for the}} bungalow--I've selected it already--is wonderful. You must come over some day and advise me. You won't mind my staying here <b>until</b> <b>I</b> can <b>get</b> settled? Wasn't that squall beautiful? And I suppose I'm late for dinner. I'll run and get clean, and be with you in a minute." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Story be damned!' {{said the}} Time Traveller. 'I want {{something}} to eat. I won't say a word <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> some peptone into my arteries. Thanks. And the salt.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to take the first train for Wichita Falls to-day," [...] {{answered}} his uncle. [...] "I guess you boys can get along here <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right," [...] said Margery, {{accepting}} {{his suggestion}} and seating herself. [...] "Now just wait <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> the oars into the rowlocks, {{and then you}} can push me off." ...|$|E
5000|$|Hutcherson {{also made}} {{frequent}} appearances on Glenn Beck's programs. On December 17, 2013, Beck posted a 10-minute video on his website, {{in which he}} talked in length {{about his relationship with}} Hutcherson. Beck tweeted the same day: [...] "I just spoke to Hutch tonight. He is dying. He promised me that he will wait <b>until</b> <b>I</b> can <b>get</b> there Friday. Pray for his sweet wife and children." [...] Hutcherson would die the next day.|$|R
5000|$|John Prine Live {{was taped}} mostly during a three-day stint at The Coach House in San Juan Capistrano, California. It was {{released}} on Oh Boy Records, Prine's own independent label. As he explained to David Fricke in 1993, Oh Boy needed product: [...] "We didn't have another artist to put out. The idea was to have me and my guitar, telling stories and doing songs - and buying me some time <b>until</b> <b>I</b> could <b>get</b> into the studio again." ...|$|R
60|$|I thought I should 'ave {{gone crazy}} at fust, but I went {{off into the}} office without a word. Some men would ha' knocked 'im down for it, but I made {{allowances}} for 'is state o' mind, and <b>I</b> stayed inside <b>until</b> <b>I</b> see 'im <b>get</b> aboard agin.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not altogether, Tom, I had a sword-thrust in my shoulder; but I {{can do with}} it <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> back, when I {{will get}} you to bandage it for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will take}} you at once to the duchess, but I see that you are quite unfit to walk. Sit down, I beg you, <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> a chair for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, Gif. But don't {{you dare}} {{to let the}} others in on the secret <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> back," [...] {{returned}} the fun-loving Rover boy, and away he sped on his errand.|$|E
6000|$|... "That may be true, mother, {{but it will}} {{scarcely}} be as creditable. My regiment is in Boston, and {{its enemies}} are before Boston; an old soldier like captain Willoughby {{will tell you that}} the major is a very necessary officer to a corps. No--no--my best course is to fall into the current of adventurers who are pushing towards Boston, and appear like one of their number, <b>until</b> <b>I</b> can <b>get</b> an opportunity of stealing away from them, and join my own people." ...|$|R
6000|$|By bedtime Mrs. Clemens had {{reasoned}} me into {{a fairly}} rational and contented state of mind; {{but of course it}} didn't last long. So I went on thinking--mixing it with a smoke in the dressing room once an hour--until dawn this morning. Result--a sane resolution; no matter what your answer to my cable might be, I would hold still and not sail <b>until</b> <b>I</b> should <b>get</b> an answer to this present letter which I am now writing, or a cable answer from you saying [...] "Come" [...] or [...] "Remain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] Thorne added, [...] "the oats {{are about}} ripe, and though I'd rather they had stood another week or so, I'll put the binder into them at sunup to-morrow. The wheat should be nearly ready {{by the time}} I'm through, and I'll hire the help I could have {{borrowed}} if I {{had been able to}} wait a while. I'll have to let up on the haulage contract and work right on, almost without stopping, <b>until</b> <b>I</b> can <b>get</b> the thrashers in; but I'll put the crop on the market before the note is due!" ...|$|R
