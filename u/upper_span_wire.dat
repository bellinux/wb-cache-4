50|$|The {{line was}} {{electrified}} at 500 volts direct current, with power supplied through simple trolley wire supported either from <b>span</b> <b>wires</b> between steel poles (concrete poles between Immingham Town and Immingham Dock), or from side brackets. Current collection was by trolley poles. A separate high-tension feeder on wooden poles ran alongside the line, providing current for dock operation in Grimsby.|$|R
50|$|In its {{original}} form, the Type B was an equal <b>span,</b> <b>wire</b> braced two bay biplane, though the inner bay {{was only about}} half the width of the outer. The two spar fabric covered wings had the same rectangular plan apart from angled tips. There was no stagger, so the three sets of parallel interplane struts were parallel and vertical; the innermost pair defined the centre section and supported the nacelle with the assistance of further cabane struts. The rear spar was ahead of mid-chord, leaving the ribs in the rear part of the wing flexible and allowing roll control by wing warping. A second Type B, the B2 which appeared in August 1911 with similar wings, was six months later modified into a sesquiplane with an <b>upper</b> wing <b>span</b> of 11.6 m, a lower span of 7.30 m and a total wing area of 32 m2. The upper overhang was supported by parallel, outward leaning struts from the bases of the outer interplane struts. Many later Caudron designs were similarly braced sesquiplanes.|$|R
25|$|The {{overhead}} line equipment {{depends on the}} location. If the tracks are close together, central poles with 'steady' arms on each side are used. If the tracks are further apart, poles on either side with <b>span</b> <b>wire</b> are used. With aesthetics in mind a minimum number of traction poles are used and whenever possible the wire is anchored onto neighbouring buildings. Supertram, Sheffield City Council and landlords were in talks to try and hide anchor points {{as much as possible}} and blend them into the structures.|$|R
25|$|The {{number of}} men enlisting {{increased}} considerably, their places being taken by women employed as conductresses, the first starting about October 1915. Some 18 months later a visit {{was made by the}} Manager and others to Glasgow to see women working as tramcar drivers. They formed the opinion that this was not desirable in Nottingham. Track replacements took place during the year on the Arkwright Street, Bulwell and Mapperley sections, while the centre poles were replaced by side poles and <b>span</b> <b>wires</b> on Parliament Street and King Edward Street.|$|R
50|$|In its {{original}} form, the Type C was an equal <b>span,</b> <b>wire</b> braced two bay biplane, though the inner bay {{was only about}} half the width of the outer. The two spar fabric covered wings had the same rectangular plan apart from angled tips. Wing area was 22 m2. There was no stagger, so the two sets of parallel interplane struts were parallel and vertical. The rear spar was ahead of mid-chord, leaving the ribs in the rear part of the wing flexible and allowing roll control by wing warping.|$|R

50|$|Apart {{from its}} tractor engine, the Salon machine {{had the same}} layout as all other Caudron biplane designs from the Type C of 1912 to the G.4 of 1915. Its wings were {{rectangular}} in plan apart from their rounded tips; the <b>upper</b> <b>span</b> was 45% greater than the lower. There was no stagger, so the three sets of parallel interplane struts on each side were vertical. Roll control was by wing warping.|$|R
50|$|The Caudron C.220 basic trainer was {{a single}} bay biplane with two pairs of {{parallel}} interplane struts aided by wire bracing and two pairs of parallel cabane struts between the upper wing and the upper fuselage longerons. The wings were rectangular in plan and of similar chord though the <b>upper</b> <b>span</b> was about 3% greater. The wings were built from spruce and fabric covered. Ailerons were carried on the lower wing only.|$|R
50|$|Examples of {{a racing}} variant {{were built in}} 1910. This had a reduced wingspan, with the <b>upper</b> wing <b>spanning</b> 8.5 m and a {{monoplane}} tail.|$|R
50|$|Although {{replacement}} of the midsection was the single largest change in the $15,000,000 process, many other important improvements were made during the conversion. A major modification was made to the stern, including a new counterbalanced rudder, new stern casting and struts, and new shorter propeller shafts and stern tubes. The latest in fueling and replenishment at sea equipment was also added, including kingposts with outriggers, ram tensioned <b>span</b> <b>wires</b> and high lines, electric hydraulic winches, cargo elevators, helicopter pickup area, and sliding blocks and cargo drop reels at replenishment stations. New electric pumps, larger cargo piping, and double-hose fueling rigs were also added, {{as well as a}} 4,500-kilowatt auxiliary diesel generator plant, and more enclosed stowage space. Habitability was also improved.|$|R

50|$|The Latham E-5 was {{the largest}} of Latham's three big biplane flying boats. The earlier Trimotor and rather similar HB.5 both had only {{slightly}} shorter <b>span</b> <b>upper</b> wing <b>spans</b> but much smaller lower wings; the E-5 was an equal span biplane {{and as a result}} had over 40% more wing area. It also had 60% more power, allowing a 50% increase in gross weight. It was developed by Jean Latham together with Weber and Levavasseur.|$|R

40|$|With {{information}} access {{becoming more}} and more ubiquitous, {{there is a need for}} providing QoS support for communication that <b>spans</b> <b>wired</b> and wireless networks. For the wired side, RSVP/SBM has been widely accepted as a flow reservation scheme in IEEE 802 style LANs. In this paper, we investigate the integration of RSVP and a RSVP-like flow reservation scheme in wireless LANs, as an end-to-end solution for QoS guarantee in wired-cum-wireless networks. We propose WRESV, an RSVP-like flow reservation and admission control scheme for IEEE 802. 11 wireless LAN. Using WRESV, wired/wireless in-tegration can be easily implemented by cross-layer in-teraction at the Access Point. Main components of the integration are RSVP-WRESV parameter mapping, and the initiation of new reservation messages, depending on where senders/receivers are located. In addition, we also propose various optimizations for supporting multicast session, mobility management, and admission control. 1...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{research}} the the effects of conductor wires on transmission tower under wind load, considering the theory of flat cable assumptions, the vibration equation of transmission tower-line system under wind load was deduced.

This paper discusses {{the effect of the}} tower-line interaction on the transmission tower-line system and derives some useful results, which is useful for the future research...|$|R
50|$|By 1985, the MBTA {{was finally}} in a {{position}} to retire its PCCs from the Green Line as the issues plaguing the Boeings were resolved to a point where a majority of the cars operated reliably and the MBTA placed an order for additional light rail cars from Kinki Sharyo, which were delivered the following year. With the PCC cars retired, the Green Line operating fleet had become exclusively pantograph equipped, eliminating the need for the wire frogs that were used to guide the trolley poles' current collectors at switches. The overhead catenary received additional upgrades, the first of which used primarily <b>span</b> <b>wire</b> support from the existing line poles. The second upgrade used many more bracket arms. Due to the added weight of the new overhead construction, side guy wires were added to many existing line poles or a horizontal beam was installed across a pair of line poles.|$|R

2500|$|The G.I was a two bay triplane, the bays {{separated}} by parallel pairs of interplane struts. [...] The wings were unswept and had constant chord and blunt tips. [...] The <b>upper</b> <b>span</b> was {{significantly greater than}} that of the lower wing, so its tips were supported by extra, outward leaning parallel pairs of struts; there was little stagger. Only the upper wing carried ailerons, which had trailing edges projecting behind that of the wing. [...] The ailerons were operated by wires from the ends of long levers, each projecting above and below the wing. [...] The [...] Mercedes D.III six cylinder inline engines were mounted on the lower wing's upper surface in the inner bay and largely uncowled. [...] These drove pusher configuration propellers beyond the trailing edge via long shafts.|$|R
5000|$|After a four-week standdown, Tattnall devoted {{most of the}} {{remainder}} of the year to maintenance and upkeep. On 18 May, the warship embarked Commander, DESRON 12. She twice got underway in June for engineering training and on 8 July conducted three days of sea trials off Jacksonville. On 11 September, the ship held a dependent's cruise a day ahead of commencing an extended maintenance availability. On 18 December, the SPS-40 radar suffered damage when it rotated into <b>span</b> <b>wire</b> rigged for holiday lighting. Although a 23 December fast cruise concluded her availability, the need for a significant amount of work on her underwater hull led to the guided-missile destroyer being towed to Jacksonville Shipyard on 13 January 1987 for three months in drydock. On 9 April, Tattnall left drydock and entered Mayport under tow the following day. The ship occupied herself with inspections, sea trials, and a visit to Jacksonville as part of the [...] "Say No to Drugs" [...] program ahead of her 5 June departure for refresher training at Guatanamo Bay.|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{collision}} while refueling {{from the}} USS Hassayampa off Da Nang about midnight. We were hooked up and fueling when our radar which showed an unknown {{contact with a}} good right bearing drift suddenly painted four contacts showing no lights with about 200 yards separation between each about 2,000 yards ahead. Captain Coston waited {{for less than a}} minute expecting the Senior CO on the oiler (in tactical command) to effect breakaway, and then, with no response from Hassayampa, took tactical command himself and ordered emergency breakaway. I think we used axes to cut through either the <b>span</b> <b>wire</b> or hoses and rolled heavily to starboard. Only seconds later we saw looming about 200 yards ahead one of the four contacts, a barge cabled apparently to other barges, invisible at night with no lights. The oiler cut through the cable between the last two barges, but we had nowhere to go and plowed into (I think) barge number 2. It put a big hole in our bow which the DCA, Ltjg. Wright Nobel Rodman plugged with mattresses. Scared the piss out of me." ...|$|R
30|$|Constructs {{were loaded}} in four-point bending with an <b>upper</b> <b>span</b> of 30  mm {{and a lower}} span of 90  mm in a Material Testing System (MTS) Mini Bionix 858 test frame (MTS Systems, Eden Prairie, MN). The {{specimens}} were subjected to a displacement-controlled test at 1  mm/min until axial deflection of the actuator reached 3  mm before returning back to zero. Loading {{was conducted on the}} equivalent of dorsoventral, right-to-left lateral and ventrodorsal planes. Left-to-right lateral loading was also performed for all constructs as the double-staple construct was not symmetrical. The order in which the planar testing was performed was kept consistent for all of the testing. This took into account the plastic deformation that occurred in the plate tent groups so that the dorsoventral test was performed last. Time, load and displacement data was recorded at 100  Hz and used to calculate stiffness and peak loads.|$|R
40|$|Abstract We study {{constructive}} and resource-bounded scaled dimension as {{an information}} contentmeasure and obtain several results that parallel previous work on unscaled dimension. Scaled dimension for finite strings is developed and {{shown to be}} closely related to Kolmogorov com-plexity. The scaled dimension of an infinite sequence {{is characterized by the}} scaled dimensions of its prefixes. We obtain an exact Kolmogorov complexity characterization of scaled dimension. Juedes and Lutz (1996) established a small span theorem for P/poly-Turing reductions which asserts that for any problem A in ESPACE, either the class of problems reducible to A (thelower span) or the class of problems to which A is reducible (the <b>upper</b> <b>span)</b> has measure 0 in ESPACE. We apply our Kolmogorov complexity characterization to improve this to (- 3) rdorder scaled dimension 0 in ESPACE. As a consequence we obtain a new upper bound on theKolmogorov complexity of Turing-hard sets for ESPACE...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{investigate}} {{the frequency of}} complete sets for various complexity classes within EXP under several polynomial-time reductions {{in the sense of}} resource-bounded measure. We show that these sets are scarce: The sets that are ⩽pnα−tt-complete for NP, the levels of the polynomial-time hierarchy, and PSPACE have p 2 -measure zero for any constant α< 1; The ⩽pnc−T-complete sets for EXP have p 2 -measure zero for any constant c; Assuming MA≠EXP, the ⩽ptt-complete sets for EXP have p-measure zero. A key ingredient is the Small Span Theorem, which states that for any set A in EXP at least one of its lower span (i. e., the sets that reduce to A) or its <b>upper</b> <b>span</b> (i. e., the sets that A reduces to) has p 2 -measure zero. Previous to our work, the best published theorem along these lines held for ⩽pbtt-reductions. We establish it for ⩽pno(1) -tt-reductions...|$|R
