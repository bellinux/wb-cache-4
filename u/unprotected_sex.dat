5|$|HIV is {{typically}} transmitted through <b>unprotected</b> <b>sex</b> or intravenous drug use, {{and is often}} associated with groups such as promiscuous gay men, illicit drug users, and sex workers. For these reasons, and also because of fears of contagion, people living with HIV are frequently subjected to stigma and discrimination. Publicity campaigns around the world have aimed to counter HIV-related prejudices and misconceptions and to replace them with an accurate understanding that helps to prevent new infections. These efforts have been aided by various celebrities – including American basketball star Magic Johnson and South African judge Edwin Cameron – who have publicly announced that they are HIV-positive.|$|E

40|$|Aim The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the attitudes of midwives and gynaecologists at youth health clinics about their own thoughts of risks with <b>unprotected</b> oral <b>sex</b> and testing of orally contagious sexually transmitted infections (STI). The aim was also to investigate the level of knowledge of oral STIs. One further aim was to examine what they thought about the level of knowledge about oral STIs among adolescents and how common <b>unprotected</b> oral <b>sex</b> is within this group and if oral STIs/oral sex is brought up in the form of information or questions during STI-testing. Method Seventy-five youth health clinics all over Sweden were randomly chosen. A questionnaire was sent by mail to the clinics. It included questions about attitudes, knowledge about STIs and information exchange. A midwife or a gynaecologist was asked to fill out the questionnaire. The answers were analysed in the statistical programme SPSS. Results The percentage of answers was 76 % (57 / 75).   One third of the clinics had guidelines for oral STI-testing. Those clinics were more often testing for oral STIs, informing and asking adolescents about oral STIs. Seventy-nine percent responded that they always or sometimes informed adolescents who were tested for STIs about risks with <b>unprotected</b> oral <b>sex.</b> Almost everyone thought that the knowledge about oral STIs was insufficient among health care staff.   Staff working at clinics with guidelines more often thought that they had sufficient knowledge about oral STIs than those without guidelines. All respondents thought <b>unprotected</b> oral <b>sex</b> was common among adolescents. Eight out of ten were in favor of oral STI-testing being performed more often. The overall attitude was that adolescents should be given more information of the risks of STIs when practising <b>unprotected</b> oral <b>sex.</b> Conclusions Practise of <b>unprotected</b> oral <b>sex</b> involves a risk of transmission of oral STIs. Youth health clinics need to be more actively informing adolescents about it. There is a lack of national guidelines for testing of STIs in Sweden. The majority of youth health clinics did not have any local guidelines for oral STI-testing. Guidelines on oral STI-testing are needed for achieving a more evidence-based care in testing and informing about oral STIs. Keywords; Oral sex, STI, testing, midwives, attitudes...|$|R
25|$|<b>Unprotected</b> {{receptive}} anal <b>sex</b> (with an HIV positive partner) is the sex act {{most likely}} to result in HIV transmission. Other infections that can be transmitted by <b>unprotected</b> anal <b>sex</b> are human papillomavirus (HPV) (which can increase risk of anal cancer); typhoid fever; amoebiasis; chlamydia; cryptosporidiosis; E. coli infections; giardiasis; gonorrhea; hepatitis A; hepatitis B; hepatitis C; herpes simplex; Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (HHV-8); lymphogranuloma venereum; Mycoplasma hominis; Mycoplasma genitalium; pubic lice; salmonellosis; shigella; syphilis; tuberculosis; and Ureaplasma urealyticum.|$|R
5|$|HIV {{is spread}} {{primarily}} by <b>unprotected</b> <b>sex</b> (including anal and oral sex), contaminated blood transfusions, hypodermic needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. Some bodily fluids, such as saliva and tears, do not transmit HIV. Methods of prevention include safe sex, needle exchange programs, treating {{those who are}} infected, and male circumcision. Disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both the mother and child antiretroviral medication. There is no cure or vaccine; however, antiretroviral treatment can slow {{the course of the}} disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy. Treatment is recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made. Without treatment, the average survival time after infection is 11years.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} ways in which viruses spread from host to host but each species of virus uses only one or two. Many viruses that infect plants are carried by organisms; such organisms are called vectors. Some viruses that infect animals, {{including}} humans, are also spread by vectors, usually blood-sucking insects. However, direct transmission is more common. Some virus infections, such as norovirus and rotavirus, are spread by contaminated food and water, hands and communal objects and by intimate contact with another infected person, while others are airborne (influenza virus). Viruses such as HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C are often transmitted by <b>unprotected</b> <b>sex</b> or contaminated hypodermic needles. It is important to know how each different kind of virus is spread to prevent infections and epidemics.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the vast}} scope of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, many Malawian men believe that HIV {{contraction}} and death from AIDS are inevitable. Older men in particular often claim that the HIV/AIDS epidemic is a punishment issued by God or other supernatural forces. Other men refer to their own irresponsible sexual behaviors when explaining why they believe that death from AIDS is inevitable. These men sometimes claim that <b>unprotected</b> <b>sex</b> is natural (and therefore necessary and good) when justifying their lack of condom use during sex with extramarital partners. Finally, some men identify as HIV-positive without having undergone testing for HIV, preferring {{to believe that they}} have already been infected so they can avoid adopting undesirable preventative measures such as condom use or strict fidelity. Because of these fatalistic beliefs, many men continue engaging in extramarital sexual relations despite the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Malawi.|$|E

5|$|The most {{effective}} methods {{of birth control}} are sterilization by means of vasectomy in males and tubal ligation in females, intrauterine devices (IUDs), and implantable birth control. This {{is followed by a}} number of hormone-based methods including oral pills, patches, vaginal rings, and injections. Less effective methods include physical barriers such as condoms, diaphragms and birth control sponges and fertility awareness methods. The least effective methods are spermicides and withdrawal by the male before ejaculation. Sterilization, while highly effective, is not usually reversible; all other methods are reversible, most immediately upon stopping them. Safe sex practices, such as with the use of male or female condoms, can also help prevent sexually transmitted infections. Other methods of birth control do not protect against sexually transmitted diseases. Emergency birth control can prevent pregnancy if taken within the 72 to 120 hours after <b>unprotected</b> <b>sex.</b> Some argue not having sex as a form of birth control, but abstinence-only sex education may increase teenage pregnancies if offered without birth control education, due to non-compliance.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{method of}} {{transmission}} reflects {{the prevalence of}} chronic HBV infection in a given area. In low prevalence {{areas such as the}} continental United States and Western Europe, injection drug abuse and <b>unprotected</b> <b>sex</b> are the primary methods, although other factors may also be important. In moderate prevalence areas, which include Eastern Europe, Russia, and Japan, where 2–7% of the population is chronically infected, the disease is predominantly spread among children. In high-prevalence areas such as China and South East Asia, transmission during childbirth is most common, although in other areas of high endemicity such as Africa, transmission during childhood is a significant factor. The prevalence of chronic HBV infection in areas of high endemicity is at least 8% with 10–15% prevalence in Africa/Far East. As of 2010, China has 120 million infected people, followed by India and Indonesia with 40 million and 12 million, respectively. According to World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 600,000 people die every year related to the infection.|$|E

Babe Smith (Annette Badland) offers Abi {{work in the}} pub kitchen, and Abi tells Babe that {{she is able to}} {{turn a blind eye to}} Ben's homosexuality as long as he loves her. However, when Abi finds a present that Ben has got for Paul, she realises he has feelings for Paul and confides in Babe, who helps her to publicly announce that she is pregnant. Ben asks Abi to have a termination but then changes his mind, saying he wants the baby. Abi then goes to Babe, panicking because she has lied and is not really pregnant. When Ben accompanies her to a doctor's appointment, she gets him out of the room and confesses her lie to the doctor, who encourages her to be honest, but she then tells Ben the baby is due in October. Abi plans to get pregnant by Ben, but when he admits he may have caught an STI from a stranger, she is unable to have sex with him, so Babe tells her to get pregnant by another man. Babe forces her into getting drunk, and after a drunk Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard) compliments her, they have <b>unprotected</b> <b>sex.</b> However, Abi does not get pregnant. She decides to tell Ben the truth, but as she is about to do so, he tells her he has caught chlamydia. Abi later tests positive for chlamydia and realises that Lee may have caught it too.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the pattern of}} HIV risk behaviors among male jail detainees. From multivariate analyses of baseline data from an HIV intervention study of ours, we find that: (1) cocaine use, heroin use and multiple sexual partners; and (2) heavy drinking and marijuana are often co-occurring among this population. From pairwise analyses, we find that (1) heroin and IDU (2) <b>unprotected</b> <b>sexes</b> with main, with non-main, and in last sexual encounter are mostly co-occurring.

40|$|Tourism {{destinations}} provide unique {{social contexts}} which foster sexual risk-taking. Banff, Alberta, Canada {{is one such}} destination with high rates of STI and risk-taking, particularly among tourism workers (TWs). Twenty-five TWs (14 women and 11 men) completed a single session intervention designed to promote the consistent and correct use of condoms. The intervention, comprised of motivational and skills-based training {{and the provision of}} a range of high-quality condoms and lubricants, was delivered in a one-to-one format in community settings. Pre- and post-intervention (three weeks following) paper and pencil questionnaires were administered. Sexual experience barriers to condom use significantly decreased (P<. 001) after the intervention and confidence in condom use negotiation (P=. 005) significantly increased. Confidence in using condoms without loss of pleasure (P=. 001) also significantly increased. The number of condom use errors significantly decreased (P<. 001). All except two of the behavioral outcomes were also significant: TWs were more likely to discuss condom use before having sex (P=. 025), more likely to report condom use the last time sex occurred (P=. 005), and more likely to add lubrication to condoms for penile-vaginal sex (P=. 027). Significant changes in frequency of <b>unprotected</b> penile-anal <b>sex</b> and frequency of <b>unprotected</b> penile-vaginal <b>sex</b> were not observed; however a large effect size was observed relative to decreases in <b>unprotected</b> penile-vaginal <b>sex.</b> Together the behavioural outcomes and psychosocial outcomes suggest the potential utility for this single session program to be applied in other tourist destinations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Determinants of {{intended}} {{condom use}} with steady and casual sex partners were examined among Dutch HIVpositive {{men who have}} sex with men (MSM) (N = 296). Given the proposition that safer sex behavior among HIVpositive people is a form of prosocial behavior, the present study extended the general framework of the Theory of Planned Behavior with Schwartz’s norm-activation theory and tested the assumption that personal norms would mediate the effects of other psychosocial factors on intended condom use for anal sex. In addition, it was hypothesized that, depending on the context in which sex occurs, specific motives for <b>unprotected</b> anal <b>sex</b> may have a negative influence on intended condom use and, as such, undermine a prosocial tendency to practice safer sex.

40|$|Men {{who have}} sex with men (MSM) {{continue}} to be disproportionately affected by HIV and AIDS. The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that MSM account for 48 % of all men living with HIV and 53 % of all new HIV infections in the United States in 2007 [1], and the number of incident cases among MSM continue to increase in the U. S. while incidence has been flat or declining for other risk groups [2]. Further, MSM are at elevated risk for HIV infection throughout the world [3]. Several U. S. studies [4 - 6] suggest that <b>unprotected</b> anal <b>sex</b> accounts for the acquisition of most HIV infections among MSM, and situational factors play an important role in understanding sexual risk taking. One such factor is the use of methamphetamine during sex. Methamphetamine, a central nervous system stimulant, has been consistently linked to <b>unprotected</b> anal <b>sex</b> among MSM [7] as well as to acquisition of HIV [8]. Methamphetamine use has distinct, long lasting cognitive effects that can lead to sexual disinhibition and impaired judgment, and is often associated with poor adherence to medication regimens [9 - 11].
