In 2012, after the film was released, Barack Obama, President of the United States, recognized White's work and told her story during a speech to the Clinton Global Initiative.|$|E
5|$|In July 2005, a 6m high stone {{replica of}} Long Ya Men {{was put up}} near its {{original}} site by a joint collaboration involving the Singapore Tourism Board, the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore and the National Parks Board.

5|$|The video {{begins with}} Ryan Key {{lying on his}} bed in an apartment. Suddenly, he gets {{swallowed}} by the bedsheets (this is where the track starts to play). The scene then shifts to Key in another dimension, ending <b>up</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wife of another man. The man notices Key, and he runs away from the man. Hiding in the bathroom, Key escapes through a window, where he ends up on a neighborhood street. Someone dressed in dark clothing gestures to offer him a drink, when Key notices {{he is in a}} bar filled with Asian people. During part of the video, it features the band performing in front of a crowd wearing suits. The chase continues through a hallway, underwater, to a hospital bed, and back. The video is based in a scene of the 1999 film Being John Malkovich, where Cameron Diaz chases Catherine Keener within the subconscious of Malkovich.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the saga}} {{states that the}} forces of Ölvir were {{superior}} in numbers to those of Earl Páll, it also notes that Ölvir's ships were smaller. Ölvir brought his own ship <b>up</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> earl's, where the fighting was the fiercest. One of the earl's chieftains, Ólafr Hrólfsson, attacked Ölvir's smallest ships, and cleared three {{of them in a}} short time. Ölvir urged his men forward and was the first to board Earl Páll's own ship. When he spotted Earl Páll, Ölvir threw a spear at him, and although it was blocked by a shield, the force of the blow knocked the earl onto the deck. With the fall of Earl Páll, a great shout goes up; but just at that moment, one of the earl's best men, Sveinn 'Breastrope', hurled a large stone at Ölvir, hitting him square in the chest and knocked him overboard. Although Ölvir's men dragged him from the water, it was unclear to the battlers whether he lived or not. Ölvir's disheartened men were driven off the earl's ship, and began to withdraw. Ölvir eventually recovered his wits, but was unable to rally his troops—the battle was lost. Earl Páll pursued Ölvir's fleeing fleet into the Pentland Firth, before giving up the chase. Five of Ölvir's ships were left behind, and were captured and manned by the forces loyal to Earl Páll. The earl is later further strengthened by two longships, and his forces swells to twelve ships. The next day, Earl Páll sailed to Shetland, where he destroyed Earl Rögnvaldr's fleet. Although, Earl Rögnvaldr's forces remained on Shetland itself, Earl Páll successfully held onto the earldom. Gray stated that these battles were fought in the year 1136.|$|E

25|$|Generations {{passed and}} the purpose of the monastery was forgotten. A small town named Tristram sprang <b>up</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> monastery's ruins. When King Leoric rebuilt the monastery as a cathedral, Diablo {{manipulated}} its archbishop, Lazarus, to destroy his soulstone prison. Diablo subsequently possessed the king, sending out his knights and priests to battle against peaceful kingdoms, and then possessed the king's son, Prince Albrecht, filling the caves and catacombs beneath the cathedral with creatures formed from the young boy's nightmares.|$|E
25|$|June Hancock {{had also}} grown <b>up</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Midland Works, {{and had never}} worked inside the factory. Her mother died of {{mesothelioma}} in 1982, and June was diagnosed with the cancer herself in 1993. Mrs. Hancock instructed a solicitor shortly after she was diagnosed and the writ was issued on 5 September 1994. The two cases were heard over 6 weeks at Leeds High Court in 1995. Despite being in the terminal stage of her illness, Mrs. Hancock attended court on all but one day of the hearing.|$|E
25|$|One {{should expect}} that a gill {{breathing}} arthropod would modify its gills to breathe air {{if it were}} adapting to terrestrial environments, and not evolve new respiration organs from bottom <b>up</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original and still functioning ones. Then comes the fact that insect (larva and nymph) gills are actually {{a part of a}} modified, closed trachea system specially adapted for water, called tracheal gills. The arthropod trachea can only arise in an atmosphere and {{as a consequence of the}} adaptations of living on land. This too indicates that insects are descended from a terrestrial ancestor.|$|E

500|$|However, {{a grass-roots}} {{democratic}} movement began {{to form in}} the Summer of 1795, consisting of popular societies (clubs) and wijkvergaderingen (precinct meetings), demanding popular influence on the government. A kind of parallel government {{in the form of}} [...] "general assemblies" [...] sprang <b>up</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city governments and the provincial States that repeatedly came into conflict with the established order. In the Fall of 1795 the States-General started to work on a procedure to peacefully replace itself, [...] "by constitutional means", with a National Assembly that would possess full executive, legislative and constituent powers. This project at first met with sharp resistance [...] from the conservatives. In some cases even force was used (as in Friesland and Groningen) to overcome this opposition. The new National Assembly convened in The Hague on 1 March 1796.|$|E

To get over the mountains, the pair rent a helicopter after discovering [...] "to rent a helicopter, you can pay with cash, check, or a jaunty tune".

500|$|... "About a Girl" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Levine from Digital Spy described the song as a [...] "europoppy club pumper with an ear-snagging chorus". He suggested {{it was the}} group's most infectious single since [...] "About You Now", but called it characterless along with the album's other tracks. Fraser McAlpine of BBC regarded the song as a [...] "dancefloor-friendly tune with an insistent chorus that echoes around your head", and compared it to the group's music from previous years. Jon O'Brien of Allmusic described [...] "About a Girl" [...] as a [...] "gloriously sassy uptempo Lady Gaga-esque number that stands <b>up</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> best of their back catalog", and named it the [...] "one saving grace" [...] from the album. Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian admitted that although Sweet 7 was significantly Americanised, the track [...] "escaped with some quirky Britishness intact". The Independent critic Andy Gill criticised the song as a [...] "generic disco stomper" [...] and regarded it as [...] "vacuous".|$|E

500|$|At {{any given}} time, the four contestants who have {{accumulated}} {{the most money}} in their bouts live in [...] "Winners' Row," [...] an area of living quarters set <b>up</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hourglass. They {{are at risk of}} being displaced if someone else outscores them. During a [...] "Winner's Defense" [...] bout, the current [...] "Power Player" [...] chooses one of the four Winners' Row occupants (including himself/herself) to face off against the current Money Chair occupant. The winner claims the loser's entire winnings in addition to his/her own and assumes control of the Money Chair, while the loser is eliminated. In episode one, the Power Player was the contestant with the most winnings; starting with episode two, it was the contestant who had the highest number of correct answers from playing along in Winners' Row that day. Contestants who are defeated in the Winner's Defense bouts lose all winnings they have accumulated. All other defeated contestants, including those displaced from Winners' Row by being out-scored, may try out again for a chance to win their way back into the Money Chair.|$|E
2500|$|Jackson's {{connections}} to the University of Nebraska remain strong. It was Jackson himself that the university contacted when designing its new press box facility—Jackson's advice included a recommendation that it include a separate restroom inside the broadcast booth, as few if any broadcast booths had any suitable restroom facilities. When Jackson broadcast the Nebraska-California game the following season (the debut of the Cornhuskers' new pressbox), he found a restroom in the booth with a sign reading [...] "The Keith Jackson Memorial Bippy." [...] The sign was a joke from Jackson's longtime friend, Nebraska sports information director Don Bryant. The name stuck, and a permanent plaque was put <b>up</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> restroom door that reads [...] "The Keith Jackson Toilet Facility – Dedicated Sept 11, 1999".|$|E
2500|$|The {{rules of}} the UFC were {{modified}} so that only the official [...] "cut men" [...] {{would be allowed to}} have or apply Vaseline to the fighters. The procedures governing the transition from the fighters walk-in to the cage and while in the cage were also changed. Previously, fighters would walk <b>up</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cage, see the cut man who would apply Vaseline, be checked by the referee, and then have an opportunity to speak with or hug their coaches or cornermen before entering the cage. To prevent an opportunity for the fighters to have Vaseline applied illicitly, fighters now must first part from any company, have Vaseline applied by the cut man, be checked by the referee, and then go directly to the cage. Finally, no cornermen will be allowed to have Vaseline in the cage between rounds. In this way, the fighter's contact with Vaseline is fully controlled by the cut men and referee, who work independently of the UFC.|$|E
