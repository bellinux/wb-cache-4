25|$|The next {{relief panel}} has barely survived. It is {{supposed}} that it showed Demeter. She {{is followed by}} Hera, entering the battle in a quadriga. Her four winged horses are identified as the personifications of the four winds, Notos, Boreas, Zephyrus and Eurus. Between Hera and his father Zeus, Heracles is fighting, identified only by a frieze fragment showing a paw of his lion pelt. Zeus is physically especially present and agile. He fights by hurling lightning bolts, sending rain and massed clouds not only against two young Giants but also against their leader, Porphyrion. The next pair of fighters also shows an especially important battle scene. Athena, the city goddess of Pergamon, breaks the Giant Alkyoneus’ contact to the earth, from which {{the mother of the}} Giants, Gaia, emerges. According to legend, Alkyoneus was immortal only as long as he touched the ground, where the power of his mother could flow through him. The eastern frieze concludes with Ares, the god of war, who goes into battle with a chariot and pair of horses. His horses rear <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> winged Giant.|$|E
500|$|Much of the {{attention}} on Maulbetsch focused on his diminutive size and unique running style. [...] At , and , Maulbetsch was a small back, even {{by the standards of}} his day. [...] And his running style saw him bend his torso and propel himself like a projectile into the opposing line. [...] Indeed, he won several nicknames based on his size, running style, and fighting spirit, including the [...] "Human Bullet," [...] "Mauly", the [...] "Human Shrapnel", the [...] "Featherweight Fullback", the [...] "Michigan Cannon Ball," [...] and the [...] "German bullet." [...] Comparisons of Maulbetsch to military armaments were common. [...] In addition to the [...] "bullet", [...] "shrapnel", and [...] "cannonball" [...] nicknames, the Syracuse Herald observed: [...] "Standing <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Krupp gun has its dangers, but it is not to be compared with the dangers of standing in front of Maulbetsch when he is going full speed ahead." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "The Silence" [...] was {{directed}} by Nzingha Stewart before the video for [...] "All Night Long" [...] was shot. The video was shot in black and white, and features Burke in different outfits and dresses, {{as well as in}} a variety of sets with props. It begins with a couple of establishing shots of Burke of her posing with a balloon wearing and in another set where she is sitting on music speakers. Throughout the video, Burke is visibly in a studio with different backdrops, where she is preparing to be photographed. During the first verse, Burke is shown in the two sets while she sings the lyrics. Prior to the first chorus, a new set is introduced of Burke wearing a black dress which exposes all of her back while sitting {{on the floor next to}} a stereo. During the first verse, all three sets show Burke carrying out different tasks with he props, as well as a new set where she sits in front of a white backdrop in a plain white oversized shirt. As the second verse begins, the set of Burke sitting on the floor next to a stereo changes to that of her standing <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> microphone singing the lyrics, with the backdrop of a city skyline. During the second verse, another set is introduced of Burke posing against a stuffed animal. During the bridge, Burke sings the lyrics standing in front of the camera without any props surrounding her; prior to sustaining a long note, Burke has her back to the camera and is nude from the waist up. During the final verse, Burke's anger and desperation is shown to be heightened, as she sings to her herself in the mirror and places more emphasis on her movement. The video ends with the singer nude from the waist up and facing the camera, covering herself with her arms crossed over her chest.|$|E
2500|$|It {{should also}} be noted that Egyptians {{themselves}} did not refer to themselves as [...] "Black" [...] as they had no conception of [...] "race". However, S. O. Y. Keita, a biological anthropologist studying the controversy, finds simplistic political appellations (in the negative or affirmative) describing ancient populations as [...] "black" [...] or [...] "white" [...] to be inaccurate and instead focuses on the ancestry of ancient Egypt as being a part of the native and diverse biological variation of Africa, which includes a variety of phenotypes and skin gradients. Responding to Hawass' assertion in the press that Egyptians were not Black or that Egypt was not an African civilization, Keita claims that Hawass' statement obscures the reality of research in the Nile valley that paints a very complex picture and that most people familiar with this research would not get <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> group to make such a claim so openly.|$|E

60|$|As the {{men were}} already accoutred, the engine left the station on this {{occasion}} {{in less than five}} minutes. The distance was short, so the pace was full speed, and in an incredibly short space of time they drew <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large, handsome shop, from the first-floor windows of which thick smoke and a few forked flames were issuing.|$|E

Louis {{dismissed}} the man and looked {{for a moment or two}} up and down the pavement. His caution appeared to be quite needless, for the thoroughfare was none too well lit, and it was almost empty. Then he entered the cafe, motioning me to follow him.|$|E
60|$|We reached St. Claude at daybreak, and {{following}} Madame's directions, the driver pulled <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large {{house in the}} Avenue du Jura. Again there was the same difficulty in hoisting the unwieldy lady out of the vehicle, but this time, in response to my vigorous pull at the outside bell, the concierge and another man {{came out of the}} house, and very respectfully they approached Madame and conveyed her into the house.|$|E

[...] And when a wily steamer, after sidling along the shore, lay <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> town she became [...] "indistinguishable from the houses," [...] and so was safe because we do not löwestrafe open towns.|$|E

I didn't find him, Baas, {{although}} I heard him. But one of their captains stood <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> watchfire, giving a good shot. My bullet found him, Baas, for he tumbled back into the fire making the sparks fly this way and that. Then I ran and, as you see, got here quite safely." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{feature of}} it which {{impressed}} Ashe most at this moment, however, {{was the fact}} that it looked warm; {{and for the first time}} since the drive began he found himself in a mood that approximated cheerfulness. It was a little early to begin feeling cheerful, he discovered, for the journey was by no means over. Arrived within sight of the castle, the cart began a detour, which, ten minutes later, brought it under an arch and over cobblestones to the rear of the building, where it eventually pulled <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> great door.|$|E
60|$|She stood <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mirror, {{over which}} she lighted a shaded candle, {{and for a}} moment or two her white hands flashed deftly in and out amongst the dark, silky coils of disordered hair. Paul sat down, and taking up a {{magazine}} which he found lying on the divan, tried to concentrate his thoughts upon its contents. But he could not. Every moment he found his eyes and his thoughts straying to that slim, lithe figure, watching the play of her arms and the grace of her backward pose. When she looked suddenly round, on the completion of her task, their eyes met.|$|E

6000|$|They {{had lost}} {{themselves}} somewhere between Oxford Street and Regent Street. The car pulled <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> restaurant which Arnold had certainly never {{seen or heard}} of before. It was quite small, and it bore the name [...] "Café André" [...] painted upon the wall. The lower windows were all concealed by white curtains. The entrance hall was small, {{and there was no}} commissionnaire. Fenella, who led the way in, did not turn into the restaurant but at once ascended the stairs. Arnold followed her, his sense of curiosity growing stronger at every moment. On the first landing there were two doors with glass tops. She opened one and motioned him to enter.|$|E
60|$|The cab drew <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stone {{apartment}} house; and Jill, getting out, passed {{under an}} awning through {{a sort of}} mediæval courtyard, gay with potted shrubs, to an inner door. She was impressed. Evidently the tales one heard of fortunes accumulated overnight in this magic city were true, {{and one of them}} must have fallen to the lot of Uncle Chris. For nobody to whom money was a concern could possibly afford to live in a place like this. If Croesus and the Count of Monte Cristo had applied for lodging there, the authorities would probably have looked on them a little doubtfully at first and hinted at the desirability of a month's rent in advance.|$|E
60|$|We {{had pulled}} <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large villa which stood {{within its own}} grounds. A stable-boy had run out to the horse's head, and {{springing}} down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive {{which led to the}} house. As we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a standing question.|$|E
