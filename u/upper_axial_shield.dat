The encoded MMACHC protein binds intracellular Cbl derivatives with different <b>upper</b> <b>axial</b> ligands and exhibits flavin mononucleotide (FMN) -dependent decyanase activity toward cyano-Cbl as well as glutathione (GSH) -dependent dealkylase activity toward alkyl-Cbls. We determined the structure of human MMACHC·adenosyl-Cbl complex, revealing a tailor-made nitroreductase scaffold which binds adenosyl-Cbl in a "base-off, five-coordinate" configuration for catalysis. We further identified an arginine-rich pocket close to the Cbl binding site responsible for GSH binding and dealkylation activity. Mutation of these highly conserved arginines, including a replication of the prevalent MMACHC missense mutation, Arg 161 Gln, disrupts GSH binding and dealkylation. We further showed that two Cbl-binding monomers dimerize to mediate the reciprocal exchange of a conserved "PNRRP" loop from both subunits, serving as a protein cap for the <b>upper</b> <b>axial</b> ligand in trans and required for proper dealkylation activity. Our dimeric structure is supported by solution studies, where dimerization is triggered upon binding its substrate adenosyl-Cbl or cofactor FMN.

50|$|Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase is {{a member}} of the {{isomerase}} subfamily of adensylcobalamin-dependent enzymes. Furthermore, it is classified as class I, as it is a ‘DMB-off’/’His-on’ enzyme. This refers to the nature of the AdoCbl cofactor in the active site of methylmalonyl CoA. AdoCbl is composed of a central cobalt-containing Corrin ring, an <b>upper</b> <b>axial</b> ligand (β-axial ligand), and a lower axial ligand (α-axial ligand). Both axial ligands are initially bonded to the central cobalt atom. In methylmalonyl-CoA mutase the β-axial ligand is 5’-deoxy-5’-adenosine and is involved in the free radical chemistry of the reaction. The α-axial ligand is 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole (DMB) and is involved in organizing the active site to enable Histidine-610 to bond with Co, instead of DMB (the reason for the ‘DMB-off’/’His-on’ notation). The Histidine-610 residue is critical to enzyme functionality. Its binding increases the rate of homolytic β-axial ligand - Co bond breakage by a factor of 1012.|$|R

We present the structure determination {{of a member}} of the mammalian Cbl-transporter family. The crystal structures of recombinant human and bovine holo-TCs reveal a two-domain architecture, with an N-terminal α 6 -α 6 barrel and a smaller C-terminal domain.

In a second step, the weakly coordinated ligand H 2 O at the <b>upper</b> <b>axial</b> side of added H 2 O-Cbl is displaced by a histidine residue of the α 6 -α 6 barrel. Analysis of amino acid conservation on TC’s surface in orthologous proteins suggests the location of the TC-receptor-recognition site in an extended region on the α 6 -α 6 barrel. The TC structure allows for the mapping of sites of amino acid variation due to polymorphisms of the human TC gene.

40|$|Cobalamin-dependent {{methionine}} synthase (MetH) is a modular {{protein that}} catalyzes {{the transfer of}} a methyl group from methyltetrahydrofolate to homocysteine to produce methionine and tetrahydrofolate. The cobalamin cofactor, which serves as both acceptor and donor of the methyl group, is oxidized once every ≈ 2, 000 catalytic cycles and must be reactivated by the uptake of an electron from reduced flavodoxin and a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet). Previous structures of a C-terminal fragment of MetH (MetHCT) revealed a reactivation conformation that juxtaposes the cobalamin- and AdoMet-binding domains. Here we describe 2 structures of a disulfide stabilized MetHCT (s-sMetHCT) that offer further insight into the reactivation of MetH. The structure of s-sMetHCT with cob(II) alamin and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine represents the enzyme in the reactivation step preceding electron transfer from flavodoxin. The structure supports earlier suggestions that the enzyme acts to lower the reduction potential of the Co(II) /Co(I) couple by elongating the bond between the cobalt and its <b>upper</b> <b>axial</b> water ligand, effectively making the cobalt 4 -coordinate, and illuminates the role of Tyr- 1139 in the stabilization of this 4 -coordinate state.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) catalyzes the {{terminal}} {{step in the}} formation of biological methane from methyl-coenzyme M (Me-SCoM) and coenzyme B (CoBSH). The active site in MCR contains a Ni-F 430 cofactor, which can exist in different oxidation states. The catalytic mechanism of methane formation has remained elusive despite intense spectroscopic and theoretical investigations. On the basis of spectroscopic and crystallographic data, the first step of the mechanism is proposed to involve a nucleophilic attack of the NiI active state (MCRred 1) on Me-SCoM to form a NiIII-methyl intermediate, while computational studies indicate that the first step involves the attack of NiI on the sulfur of Me-SCoM, forming a CH 3 radical and a NiII-thiolate species. In this study, a combination of Ni K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopic (XAS) studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been performed on the NiI (MCRred 1), NiII (MCRred 1 -silent), and NiIII-methyl (MCRMe) states of MCR to elucidate the geometric and electronic structures of the different redox states.

40|$|A {{dissertation}} {{submitted to}} the Faculty of Science, University of the Witwatersrand, in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, April 2013. Density functional theory (DFT) and time dependent-DFT (TD-DFT) was applied to investigate the geometric and electronic properties of cobalamin (Cbl) models. Model compounds of the type, [B–(Co(III) (L) 4 –X) –Y]n+ were used, where B and Y were comprised of the alpha (α) and β axial ligands, (L) 4 represented the equatorial ligand(s) and X was either hydrogen or a substituent of electron donating or withdrawing character, quantified by the Hammett constant (σp), at C 10 of the corrin. All calculations were conducted in the gas phase or implicit solvent medium at the BP 86 / 6 - 31 +G(d,p) level of theory. High-resolution crystal structures of B 12, extracted from the Cambridge Crystal Structural Database (CCSD), were used {{as the source of}} initial coordinates. DFT was used to explore the trans influence of the lower (α) axial ligand, the cis influence of various equatorial ligands and the cis influence of a substituted corrin ring at the C 10 position on the Gibbs free energy (ΔG) and bond dissociation energies (BDEs) of the Co(III) –Cβ bond. Other geometric parameters such as ring distortion, axial bond lengths, equatorial bond lengths and partial charges on the Co metal centre, donor atom of the <b>upper</b> and lower <b>axial</b> ligands as well as the N-donor atoms of the macrocyclic ring are documented and discussed. The use of a broad range of alpha (α) ligands in the cobalamin models from charged and neutral N-donor ligands (NH 3, NH 2 –, NH 2 –, NH 2 F, NHF–, NF 2 –, NH 2 CH 3, NHCH 3, NH(CH 3) 2, N(CH 3) 3), to naturally occurring amino acids or realistic models of their metal-coordinating side chains (methanethiol, dimethylsulfide, cysteine, methanethiolate, glycine, p-aminopyridine, imidazole, histidine, acetate, 2 -propanol, serine and tyrosine), provided significant information on the trans influence of these ligands on the BDE of the Co(III) –C bond (<b>upper</b> <b>axial</b> ligand). The ligands NH 3, NH 2 –, NH 2 –, NH 2 F, NHF–, NF 2 –, NH 2 CH 3, NHCH 3, were used to explore electronic effects while NH 3, NH 2 CH 3, NH(CH 3) 2, and N(CH 3) 3 were used to investigate steric effects. The naturally occurring amino acids or their models focused primarily on exploring why nature chooses an N-donor ligand such as histidine or imidazole instead of an S-donor or O-donor ligand that is also readily available from protein side chains. As the basicity of the α ligand increased in the series NH 2 F < NH 3 < CH 3 NH 2 < (CH 3) 2 NH < (CH 3) 3 N < NHF– < NHCH 3 – < NH 2 – < NF 2 – < NH 2 –(as assessed by the proton affinities) a normal trans influence was observed between the axial ligands. While the Co(III) –C bond was observed to increase in length, the Co(III) –Nα bond length decreased. The weakening of the Co(III) –C bond was paralleled by the decrease in the Co(III) –C BDE. On the other hand, as the steric bulk of the α ligand (NH 3, NH 2 CH 3, NH(CH 3) 2, and N(CH 3) 3) increased (assessed by the molar volume and Tolman cone angle), an inverse trans influence (in other words, simultaneous lengthening or shortening) between the <b>upper</b> and lower <b>axial</b> bonds was observed. The Co(III) –C bond showed a marginal increase in length while the Co(III) –Nα bond length steadily increased as the molar volume of the α ligand increased. Interestingly, the large difference in the Co–Nα bond length from the 5 -coordinate to the 6 -coordinate complex (later referred to as ΔCo–Nα(5 c- 6 c)), paralleled the decrease of the Co(III) –C BDEs. It also became evident from calculations with the amino acids posing as α ligands that the nature of the α ligand (assessed by the absolute chemical hardness (η) of the ligand, with the greater the η value the harder the ligand) {{plays a major role in}} the labilisation of the organometallic bond. As the η of the α ligand increased, the Co(III) –C BDE increased. The trans influence of the α ligands resulted in the strengthening (hard ligand) and weakening (soft ligand) of the Co(III) –C bond, as was affirmed by the electron density at the bond critical point (bcp) of the Co(III) –C bond. The N-donor ligands (described as having an intermediate character as the η- values were between the hard and soft ligands) were found to be catalytically suitable (31. 89 – 32. 45 kcal mol - 1), rather than the soft and hard donor ligands. The trans influence of the latter two ligands on the <b>upper</b> <b>axial</b> bond revealed a weakly and strongly bound alkyl group to the Co metal centre, giving Co(III) –C BDEs values of 29. 39 – 32. 27 kcal mol- 1 and 32. 54 – 34. 96 kcal mol- 1, respectively. In addition to the corrin macrocycle, other equatorial ligands like cobaloxime, corrole, porphyrin, methylcobalt(III) pentaamine, [14 -ane]N 4, [15 -ane]N 4 and [16 -ane]N 4 were used in calculations to explore the cis influence on the labilisation of the Co(III) –C bond. These ligands included saturated and unsaturated cyclic rings. The results showed that the flexibility of the ring increased as the size of the equatorial ligand increased and thus affected the displacement of the Co(III) metal centre from the defined mean plane. This subsequently affected the strength of the organometallic bond, which paralleled the BDEs. The hydrogen atom at C 10 of the corrin ring was substituted by electron donating (CH 3, OH and NH 2) or –withdrawing groups (NO, NO 2, CN, COOH and Br) and the cis influence of these groups on the organometallic bond was investigated. A normal trans influence between the axial ligands was observed. As the electron density from the substitutents increased towards the ring, the Co(III) –C bond strengthened and the Co(III) –Nα bond weakened. The increased electron density from the C 10 substituents influenced the contraction of the Co–Nα bond length. The greater difference in contraction of the Co–Nα bond length from the 5 -coordinate to the 6 -coordinate complex (ΔCo–Nα(5 c- 6 c)) resulted in lower Co(III) –C BDEs. The TD-DFT method was used to generate both the absorption and circular dichroism (CD) spectra where the vertical electronic excited states of Co(III) cobalamin species that differ with respect to their <b>upper</b> <b>axial</b> ligand, including FCbl, ClCbl, BrCbl,SeCNCbl and CH 3 Cbl were calculated. The cis influence for each of the species was analysed within the framework of TD-DFT to assign the major spectral features, in other words, the α/β, D/E and γ bands in the predicted UV-visible spectra. These studies reveal that the “typical” and “atypical” absorption exhibit a high degree of σ-donation from the β-ligand to the Co(III) metal centre and the subsequent destabilisation of the corresponding d-orbitals of Co. Furthermore, as the donor ability of the β ligand increased, the contributions from the antibonding d z 2 orbital to the HOMO increased, leading to a strong Co(III) –Nα σ-antibonding interaction, which is consistent with the observed lengthening of the same bond from FCbl, ClCbl, BrCbl, SeCNCbl to CH 3 Cbl...|$|R
40|$|In its {{deployment}} as {{a pebble}} bed reactor (PBR) critical facility from 1992 to 1996, the PROTEUS facility was designated as HTR-PROTEUS. This experimental program was performed {{as part of}} an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Coordinated Research Project (CRP) on the Validation of Safety Related Physics Calculations for Low Enriched HTGRs. Within this project, critical experiments were conducted for graphite moderated LEU systems to determine core reactivity, flux and power profiles, reaction-rate ratios, the worth of control rods, both in-core and reflector based, the worth of burnable poisons, kinetic parameters, and the effects of moisture ingress on these parameters. One benchmark experiment was evaluated in this report: Core 4. Core 4 represents the only configuration with random pebble packing in the HTR-PROTEUS series of experiments, and has a moderator-to-fuel pebble ratio of 1 : 1. Three random configurations were performed. The initial configuration, Core 4. 1, was rejected because the method for pebble loading, separate delivery tubes for the moderator and fuel pebbles, may not have been completely random; this core loading was rejected by the experimenters. Cores 4. 2 and 4. 3 were loaded using a single delivery tube, eliminating the possibility for systematic ordering effects. The second and third cores differed slightly in the quantity of pebbles loaded (40 each of moderator and fuel pebbles), stacked height of the pebbles in the core cavity (0. 02 m), withdrawn distance of the stainless steel control rods (20 mm), and withdrawn distance of the autorod (30 mm). The 34 coolant channels in the <b>upper</b> <b>axial</b> reflector and the 33 coolant channels in the lower axial reflector were open. Additionally, the axial graphite fillers used in all other HTR-PROTEUS configurations to create a 12 -sided core cavity were not used in the randomly packed cores. Instead, graphite fillers were placed on the cavity floor, creating a funnel-like base, to discourage ordering effects during pebble loading. Core 4 was determined to be acceptable benchmark experiment...|$|R

Six phases of Qualitative Item Review for item development were undertaken and included: identification of extant items, item classification and selection, item review and revision, focus group input on domain coverage, cognitive interviews on individual items, and final revision before field testing [13]. Item response theory (IRT)-based analysis of 11 large datasets supplemented and informed item-level qualitative review of nearly 7000 items from available PRO measures in the item library [12].

40|$|Nickel {{containing}} proteins {{play a role}} {{in several}} important biological processes, including methanogenesis (MCR) and superoxide detoxification (NiSOD). However, nickel is also known to mediate carcinogenesis, probably through a process involving coordination to histone proteins within the nucleosome. Therefore, nickel homeostasis must be tightly regulated. In many bacteria and archaea this function is performed by the Nik system. The NikABCDE protein assembly transports nickel into the cell, the transcription of which is repressed by the nickel binding protein, NikR. ^ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a sensitive probe for geometry and ligand type. A combination of model studies and XAS was used to analyze the structural changes that occur at the nickel sites of the enzymes NiSOD, NikR, and MCR. XAS was also used to identify the mode by which nickel may bind to His residues in histone H 4. ^ Mutagenesis and XAS studies indicate that the high-affinity nickel site in NikR has square planar geometry and has an N 2 OS-donor ligand environment composed of His, Glu and Cys ligands. XAS studies further reveal structural changes that occur upon DNA-binding {{and as a result of}} mutations in the DNA- and Ni-binding domains. These results suggest that there is communication between the DNA- and Ni-binding domains of the protein. ^ Investigation of the active site of MCR in the EPR active forms MCR red 1 and MCRox 1 and in the epr silent, Ni(II) forms MCR silent, and MCRox 1 -silent show that in all four states, nickel is hexacoordinate. The only significant difference being in the nature of the <b>upper</b> <b>axial</b> ligand. Resonance Raman and model studies of the tetrapyrrole cofactor F 430, indicate that activation of MCR involves reduction of a C=N bond that likely primes the enzyme for catalysis. ^ In all known anaerobes, superoxide detoxification is performed by iron containing superoxide reductases (SORs). XAS studies on samples of the reduced and photo-reduced, ‘oxidized’ forms of FeSOR from D. vulgaris were performed to determine the extent to which reduction affects ligation. Data collected on the cyanide adduct of the oxidized form indicated that inhibition involves displacement of a Cys-S ligand. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} of complex molecular architectures in a facile and efficient manner remains an overarching {{goal for the}} chemical sciences. The development of synthetic linchpins, simple compounds {{that are used to}} join complex molecular fragments together, represents a powerful method for improving synthetic efficiency. A major challenge associated with linchpin-based synthetic strategies is the development of chemoselective and atom economic reactions that enable late-stage introduction of the linchpin compound. Chiral propargylic alcohols are versatile synthetic intermediates and their preparation enables entry into a variety of alkyne-based linchpin strategies. Continued optimization of Zn-ProPhenol-catalyzed alkyne addition has {{led to the development of}} practical and general conditions for the asymmetric alkynylation of aldehydes. This methodology operates with relatively low catalyst loading and can avoid the use of excess alkyne and dialkylzinc reagents. The total synthesis of asteriscunolide D was completed in just nine steps using a Zn- ProPhenol-catalyzed asymmetric alkynylation and Ru-catalyzed alkene-alkyne coupling. Other highlights of this protecting-group-free synthesis include the use of a thionium-induced cyclization to form the challenging 11 -membered humulene ring. At the core of this succinct and selective synthetic strategy is the use of methyl propiolate as a strategic linchpin. In just two steps, three new bonds were formed to atoms derived from methyl propiolate and this ultimately enabled the {{construction of}} this structurally challenging natural product. An enantioselective formal total synthesis of aspergillide B has been accomplished using sequential Zn-catalyzed alkyne additions to a masked butane dialdehyde linchpin. This synthesis has led to the development of new conditions for Zn-ProPhenol-catalyzed alkynylation that provide excellent yield and enantioselectivity using just a single equivalent of alkyne. Ru-catalyzed trans-hydrosilylation provides the desired E alkene geometry and also allows chemoselective differentiation of the two double bonds in a subsequent hydrogenation step. This synthetic route provides access to aspergillide B in just 15 steps, using six highly efficient transition metal-catalyzed reactions. Labillarides E-H are a group of diastereomeric oxylipin natural products with very interesting structural features and spectroscopic properties. The development of a Pdcatalyzed allylic alkylation cascade has enabled the rapid construction of the furanopyrone core and alkenyl side chain of these compounds. The use of density functional calculations, in conjunction with spectroscopic data obtained from the truncated labillaride E-H structure, has provided good evidence that labillarides E and G have a 3, 6 -syn configuration, whereas labillarides F and H have a 3, 6 -anti configuration. Subsequent development of the Pd-AA cascade methodology has led to the discovery of a highly regioselective Pd-AA cascade with non-symmetric dihydropyran substrates. The combination of allylic carbonate and anomeric siloxy leaving groups in the dihydropyran substrate enables control of the many regiochemical possibilities in this reaction. Ultimately, annulation proceeds stereoconvergently to give a cisfused furopyran from either cis- or trans-substituted starting material. During the course of this research, the assignment of the remote relative stereochemistry of a number of 3, 6 -dihydro- 2 Hpyran starting materials and side products was achieved through a novel NMR-based analysis of <b>axial</b> <b>shielding</b> magnitudes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a {{protocol}} of inverted drop-tests using a 50 th percentile Hybrid III Anthropomorphic Test Device (ATD) and investigate the influence of angle and velocity at impact on neck injury risk assessment. The tests were based on existing cadaveric experimental protocols for inverted seated positions. In this study selected ATD impact orientations were also assessed in both the sagittal and coronal planes. Twenty-six tests were performed at impact velocities from 1. 4 m. s- 1 to 3. 1 m. s- 1. The drop tests confirmed previously described behaviour of the ATD in axial loading of its head/neck/thorax complex. They also showed a significant influence of the initial impact angle on neck injury criteria currently used by researchers in rollover crashworthiness tests. At 1. 4 m. s- 1, the peak <b>upper</b> neck <b>axial</b> force of 4350 N was reduced by an average 1760 N ± 80 N for configurations with 30 degrees initial impact angle in any plane, compared to a reference inverted vertical configuration. The Nij was also significantly influenced. For a given impact velocity, an out-of-both-planes initial configuration resulted in the highest combined outputs. Based on these results, similar dynamic conditions (intrusion velocity, impact duration) may result in significantly different loadings of the Hybrid III neck...|$|R
