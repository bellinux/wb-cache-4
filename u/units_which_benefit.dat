Although traffic and port activity has declined since the early 90's, losing some of it to the nearby Port Everglades, which overtook Port of Miami in 2007 as Florida's largest cargo port, the port is likely to see a large shift in the other direction after it becomes one of few deep water ports in the United States able to handle the New Panamax ships by 2016. Within the first month of opening, it was reported that congestion in the downtown area had eased.|$|R
40|$|A {{requirement}} for monitoring selected atmospheric constituents on board nuclear powered submarines has been {{met by the}} development of the Central Atmosphere Monitoring System, Mark I. This system employs a mass spectrometer to monitor H 2, H 2 O, N 2, O 2, CO 2, Freon 11, Freon 12, and Freon 114, in addition to an infrared sensor for CO. The CAMS MKI development is discussed, including background, operating fundamentals, principal requirements, functional and physical descriptions, and summarized test results. Each of two prototype units has successfully completed over 9000 hr of operational sea trails, providing the necessary ground work for the manufacture of production units. At the same time, these <b>units,</b> <b>which</b> have <b>benefited</b> extensively from NASA hardware experience, may in turn provide useful data {{for the development of a}} new class of maintainable atmospheric monitoring instrumentation for manned spacecraft...|$|R
40|$|Many animal species, from {{arthropods}} to apes, share food. This paper {{presents a}} new framework that categorizes nonkin food sharing {{according to two}} axes: (1) the interval between sharing and receiving the benefits of sharing, and (2) the currency <b>units</b> in <b>which</b> <b>benefits</b> accrue to the sharer (especially food versus nonfood). Sharers can obtain immediate benefits from increased foraging efficiency, predation avoidance, mate provisioning, or manipulative mutualism. Reciprocity, trade, status enhancement and group augmentation can delay benefits. When benefits are delayed or when food is exchanged for nonfood benefits, maintaining sharing can become more difficult because animals face discounting and currency conversion problems. Explanations that involve delayed or nonfood benefits may require specialized adaptations to account for timing and currency-exchange problems. The immediate, selfish fitness benefits that a sharer may gain through by-product or manipulative mutualism, however, apply to various food-sharing situations across many species and may provide a simpler, more general explanation of sharing...|$|R
40|$|Telecommunication {{industry}} {{is characterized by}} a sharp fall in <b>unit</b> price <b>which</b> highly <b>benefits</b> to consumers. This article aims to identify the main parameters that lead to such a fall. Using a 13 -countries wireless market dataset, it shows that investment actually drives the exponential growth of traffic. As the growth of revenues are much lower, the price of MByte decreases sharply. Telecom operators need some margin to invest. The increased margin increases subscription price, however, in the same time, it also increases investment. The paper shows that the impact on investment highly outweighs the impact on subscription price. As a result, the overall impact of increased margin is the fall of Mbyte price...|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{spray forming}} work {{was based on}} a resistively heated electric holding furnace. The melt then passed through a 3 mm diameter Al2O3 nozzle. However the low flow rate made a high superheat necessary to prevent solidification in the nozzle. The next generation melting procedures in spray forming applications were bottom pour induction <b>units,</b> <b>which</b> offer many <b>benefits.</b> In this system, the melting crucible is directly above the atomiser head with a ceramic nozzle feeding directly from the furnace to the atomiser. A stopper rod runs through the melt {{to the top of the}} pouring nozzle, the rod is withdrawn when the melt reaches the designated temperature for spraying, typically 50 to 150 C above the alloy's liquidus. Alternatively a pre-prepared plug of alloy to block the nozzle is used, and at a specified superheat this plug melts allowing the contents of the furnace to drain through the nozzle. Another problem associated with bottom pour furnaces is the change in flow rate associated with the reducing metalo-static head in the crucible. In some cases, introducing an inert gas overpressure during pouring can compensate for this effect.|$|R
