5000|$|Foodborne illness, {{commonly}} called [...] "food poisoning", {{is caused by}} bacteria, toxins, viruses, parasites, and prions. Roughly 7 million people die of food poisoning each year, with about 10 times as many suffering from a non-fatal version. The two most common factors leading to cases of bacterial foodborne illness are cross-contamination of ready-to-eat food from other uncooked foods and improper temperature control. Less commonly, acute adverse reactions can also occur if chemical contamination of food occurs, for example from improper storage, or use of non-food grade soaps and disinfectants. Food can also be adulterated by a very wide range of articles (known as [...] "foreign bodies") during farming, manufacture, cooking, packaging, distribution, or sale. These foreign bodies can include pests or their droppings, hairs, cigarette butts, wood chips, {{and all manner of}} other contaminants. It is possible for certain types of food to become contaminated if stored or presented in an <b>unsafe</b> <b>container,</b> such as a ceramic pot with lead-based glaze.|$|E
25|$|The Ministry of Munitions {{announced}} {{the explosion in}} the following day's newspaper, and ordered an investigation led by Sir Ernley Blackwell, published on 24 February 1917. A definite single cause of the explosion was not determined, invalidating early theories such as German sabotage or an air-raid, but {{it was found that}} the factory's site was inappropriate for the manufacture of TNT. Management and safety practices at the plant were also criticised: TNT was stored in <b>unsafe</b> <b>containers,</b> close to the plant and the risky production process. The report was not disclosed to the public until the 1950s. Other newspapers, including the New York Times, also reported the explosion.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the types of}} hydrocarbon ingested by children and identify factors associated with hydrocarbons ingestion. Patients and Methods: It was a hospital based case control study in which medical records of sixty seven children with hydrocarbon ingestion, admitted through emergency department between January 2001 to December 2005 of Aga Khan Hospital were reviewed. Variables such as age, sex, types of hydrocarbons, amount ingested, socioeconomic status, family size, number of children, type of containers, trend of ingestion during hot weather, length of stay at hospital along with the outcomes were evaluated. Results: Out of 67 patients, 53 (79 %) were male and 14 (21 %) were female. Majority of children 36 (54 %) were between the ages 2 - 5 years. Kerosene oil 59 (88 %) was the most commonly ingested hydrocarbons. Socio-economically 48 (71 %) children belonged to lower middle class. Children with large family size (> 3 siblings/family) were more commonly affected. Hydrocarbon were mostly 41 (61 %) stored in beverages and mineral water bottles. The accident occurred in 43 (65 %) during summer, whereas 34 (56 %) patients had presented with fever and cough. Consolidation of lungs was found in 38 (56 %) cases. Majority 53 (79 %) of the patients were discharged from the hospital within the first 24 hours of admission. Male, age < 2 years, large family size, poor socioeconomic status, hot weather (afternoon and summer vacations), kerosene oil, <b>unsafe</b> <b>containers</b> were the major factors leading to hydrocarbon ingestion in this study. Conclusion: There {{is a need for}} strategic planning with parent awareness programs to reduce the hydrocarbon poisoning in our children (JPMA 58 : 608; 2008) ...|$|R
40|$|The United Nation's Millennium Development Goal Target 7. C is to "halve, by 2015, the {{proportion}} of the population without sustainable access to safe drinking water". While the UN claimed to have met this goal, {{studies have shown that the}} "improved" sources used as a metric to track progress do not always supply safe water. One example of these improved sources is the piped water in Tamale, Ghana, which is an intermittent system. The question raised and goal of this research is to determine whether this water source is indeed safe. The Ghana Water Company Ltd. in Tamale had handwritten notebooks containing almost ten years of water quality sample data. This data was entered into a computer database so it could be analyzed for seasonal and geographic trends as well as to gain an understanding of overall water quality. From this analysis, it was concluded that seasonal trends do impact the pH and turbidity of source water which influences the water provided to consumers. In addition, 42 % of samples did not comply with accepted World Health Organization guidelines for residual free chlorine concentrations. Total coliform was present in 2 % of samples. Observations of environmental factors made during field work in Tamale found five "no" answers to a sanitary survey indicating at least a medium contamination risk. Overall, these observations indicate that water from the piped network in Tamale is not always safe. Contamination also happens very readily during storage due to high usage of <b>unsafe</b> storage <b>containers</b> in Tamale combined with the low chlorine residuals. by Allison Jean Hansen.

40|$|In the {{logistics}} industry, {{in the case}} of heavy equipment accident one of them caused by the behavior of the operators of heavy equipment <b>unsafe.</b> Semarang <b>Container</b> Terminal has a Rubber Tyred Gantry (RTG) for 16 units. Rubber Tyred Gantry crane (RTG crane) is a type of gantry crane used to stack and take the container to the container yard and includes lift equipment which have a high risk. Semarang Container Terminal has a considerable number of operators and also loading-unloading activities are routine, it is very possible for accidents due to operator Rubber Tyred Gantry behavior. This study aimed to analyze the operation of the operator Rubber Tyred Gantry (RTG) in Semarang Container Terminal. This research is a descriptive qualitative in-depth interviews and observation. The subjects of this study amounted to 10 as key informants and 3 as triangulation informants. The results showed operator RTG have had knowledge of the behavior of safe work in operating RTG appropriate procedures have been defined by the company, operator RTG also have the perception if it should work safe and also had a good attitude at work, operator RTG also coordinate with the tally man who was in under RTG, in coordination with the supervision of the shift and in coordination with other operators during RTG operation, operator RTG own SIO and have training and supported by their supporting facilities related to the operation of the RTG to keep working safe, in addition to the operator RTG also agreed to the rules reward and punishment of the company {{as a consequence of the}} behavior of the operator. The conclusion of this study is the behavior of operator to appropriate RTG operation procedures. But still there are some operators that have not been orderly and often miss communication during operation of the tool. Companies need to provide stricter oversight if there are employees both operator and non-operator if any disciplinary breaches in the field and also need to improve the supporting facilities...|$|R
