5000|$|The first {{conference was}} held in 2003, and has since become one of North America's largest Islamic conferences, {{alongside}} the ISNA convention in the United States. The conference has grown from 3,500 attendees {{in its first year}} to over 20,000 in 2011, making it the largest Islamic conference in Canada. [...] Attendees and speakers attend from around the world, including the United States, Europe and the Middle East. While criticism of the event is seen from both critics of Islam and fundamentalist Muslims, organizers maintain that the event is an attempt to revive Islamic traditions of education, tolerance, and introspection. In May 2010, RIS held its first American conference in Long <b>Beach,</b> California.

40|$|Abstract: This article {{describes}} the formation of reactive oxygen species {{as a result of}} the oxidation of dissolved sulfide by Fe(III) -containing sediments suspended in oxygenated seawater over the pH range 7. 00 and 8. 25. Sediment samples were obtained from across the coastal littoral zone in South Carolina, <b>US,</b> <b>at</b> locations from <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> edge to <b>the</b> forested edge of a Spartina dominated estuarine salt marsh and suspended in aerated seawater. Reactive oxygen species (superoxide and hydrogen peroxide) production was initiated in sediment suspensions by the addition of sodium bisulfide. The subsequent loss of HS-, formation of Fe(II) (as indicated by Ferrozine), and superoxide and hydrogen peroxide were monitored over time. The concentration of superoxide rose from the baseline and then persisted at an apparent steady state concentration of approximately 500 nanomolar at pH 8. 25 and 200 nanomolar at pH 7. 00 respectively until > 97 % hydrogen sulfide was consumed. Measured superoxide was used to predict hydrogen peroxide yield based on superoxide dismutation. Dismutation alone quantitatively predicted hydrogen peroxide formation at pH 8. 25 but over predicted hydrogen peroxide formation at pH 7 by a factor of approximately 102. Experiments conducted with episodic spikes of added hydrogen peroxide indicated rapid hydrogen peroxide consumption could account for its apparent low instantaneous yield, presumably the result of its reaction with Fe(II) species, polysulfides or bisulfite. All sediment samples were characterized for total Fe, Cu, Mn, Ni, Co and hydrous ferric oxide by acid extraction followed by mass spectrometric or spectroscopic characterization. Sediments with the highest loadings of hydrous ferric oxide were the only sediments that produced significant dissolved Fe(II) species or ROS as a result of sulfide exposure...|$|R
50|$|Gorson {{went on to}} head {{production}} companies {{based in}} New York; working {{in the areas of}} film production, soundtrack & post-production supervision, and concert production. He then relocated to Los Angeles where he assumed the position of feature producer for Dreamstreet, Inc., with offices at Universal and Paramount, and working with directors such as Tony Scott, Taylor Hackford and Andrei Konchalovsky. Gorson has multiple feature film credits as producer. These include Cronos, directed by Guillermo Del Toro and shot by Academy Award winner Guillermo Navarro; its many awards include the Cannes Film Festival Grand Prix of Critic's Week and 9 Ariel del Oro awards (Mexico's Academy Awards). Better Watch Out!, directed by Monte Hellman and starring Robert Culp and Richard Beymer, was produced by Gorson from a story by Hellman, Gorson and Carlos Lazlo; it was distributed by Carolco/LIVE Entertainment with cable rights through HBO. He was a producer of the historical epic Cabeza de Vaca, directed by Nicolas Echevarria and made for American Playhouse Theatrical Films (US), IMCINE (Mexico) and Producciones Iguana (Mexico); the film had its world premiere in competition <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Berlin Film Festival. He is credited as executive producer (for US post-production) on Timur Bekmambetov's groundbreaking 2005 film Night Watch. That film broke all box office records in Russia. He had a long-running creative relationship with the late Jamaican Filmmaker Perry Henzell (The Harder They Come) and is credited as a producer on Henzell's recently completed film No Place Like Home. His recent documentary The Roots of Reggae (produced with Wayne Jobson) had its <b>U.S.</b> premiere <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Palm <b>Beach</b> Film Festival. A new documentary project A Filmmaker's Odyssey had its international film festival premiere September, 2015.|$|R
