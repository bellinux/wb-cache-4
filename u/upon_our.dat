5|$|Kailua, now {{the capital}} of Owhyhee, was {{the seat of the}} {{government}} of the group after the conquests of the renowned Kamehameha I., who, it will be remembered, died here. It is situated within a wide bay, with a safe roadstead and good anchorage. It has a very few more inhabitants than some of the larger villages in the island, though much frequented by the natives living in the vicinity, on account of its being the centre of their civil and religious affairs. It has, however, four stone buildings and a fort. The buildings are, the residence of the governor; that of the parent of the missionaries, Mr. Thurston, whom we have had already occasion to name; and two places of worship. Immediately <b>upon</b> <b>our</b> arrival, we called to pay our respects to the governor, Kapeau, a native chief, who received us with good-humoured frankness, and ordered a room in the government-house to be prepared for our reception and residence; in order, as he said, that we might be as near to him as possible during our stay in the place. We were not long installed, before the hospitable chief came to pay us a visit, and, as it happened to be a bright moonlight night, he invited us to go at once in his company, to inspect the fort, which was in front of his residence, and which in passable English he called the right arm of his strength. We found it consist of a single battery commanding the bay, with twelve pieces of cannon of not very large calibre.|$|E

25|$|When Louis XVIII died, she was {{received}} at Court more frequently. Her granddaughter remembered seeing her grandmother {{talking with the}} Duchess of Angoulême, during the King’s visit to Naples, in 1827, at the castle, where Charles X, rested his hand <b>upon</b> <b>our</b> heads, asking each of us our age, he chatted a few moments with our grandmother and inquired about her interests.|$|E
25|$|After {{the raid}} there were worries in April about the still very badly {{undermanned}} west coast and Chief of Staff George Marshall discussed a possible {{attack by the}} Japanese <b>upon</b> <b>our</b> plants in San Diego and then a flight by those Japs down into Mexico after they have made their attack. So Secretary Stimson asked State to touch base with their people south of the border, and Marshall flew to the West Coast on 22 May.|$|E

25|$|In {{things that}} pertain to {{celestial}} glory {{there can be}} no forced operations.

We cannot be crowded into matters, however great might be the blessing attending such procedure. We cannot be forced into living a celestial law; we must do this ourselves, of our own free will. And whatever we do in regard to the principle of the United Order, we must do it because we desire to do it.|$|E
25|$|We felt keenly {{that while}} the miraculous events of the {{founding}} of the State of Israel had found fitting expression {in the other Conservative siddurim} the more difficult experience of the Holocaust had yet to find an appropriate place in our prayers, Therefore, we composed a Nahum prayer for Yom Ha-shoah, inspired by that which appeared in Siddur Va-ani Tefillati of the Masorti Movement in 1998. In an insert into the Amidah, similar to that used traditionally on Tisha B'Av, we seek God's comfort in light of our people's losses in Europe during the Holocaust. We felt the need, beyond that, to acknowledge on a daily basis the enormous effect that the Holocaust has had <b>upon</b> <b>our</b> people. At the end of Tahanun papers, in a prayer which reflects our suffering, we added reference to the anguish we still feel.|$|E
25|$|It {{must surely}} have a deplorable effect <b>upon</b> <b>our</b> Allies {{to be told}} by an ex-Cabinet Minister that the Palestine Administration do not like Jews, {{and that there are}} enough anti-Semites in Great Britain to back up the Hitler policy and spirit. This {{suggestion}} is a complete reversal of the truth. If a comparison is to be made with the Nazis, it is surely those who wish to force an imported régime upon the Arab population who are guilty of the spirit of aggression and domination. Lord Wedgwood's proposal that Arabs should be subjugated by force to a Jewish régime is inconsistent with the Atlantic Charter, and that ought to be told to America. The second principle of that Charter lays down that the United States and ourselves desire to see no territorial changes that do not accord with the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned; and the third principle lays down that they respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of Government under which they will live.|$|E

25|$|The German {{occupation}} of the Czech areas of Czecho-Slovakia on the Ides of March, in total contravention of the Munich Agreement that had been signed {{less than six months}} before, infuriated British and French public opinion and lost Germany all sympathy. Such was the state of public fury that it appeared possible for several days afterwards that the Chamberlain government might fall due to a backbench rebellion. Even Ribbentrop's standard line that Germany was only reacting to an unjust Versailles treaty, and really only wanted peace with everyone, which had worked so well in the past, failed to carry weight. Reflecting the changed mood, the Conservative M.P Alfred Duff Cooper {{wrote in a letter to}} The Times:"Some of us are getting rather tired of the sanctimonious attitude which seeks to take <b>upon</b> <b>our</b> shoulders the blame for every crime committed in Europe. If Germany had been left stronger in 1919 she would sooner have been in a position to do what she is doing today". Moreover, the British government had genuinely believed in the German claim that it was only the Sudetenland that concerned them, and that Germany was not seeking to dominate Europe. By occupying the Czech parts of Czecho-Slovakia, Germany lost all credibility with its claim to be only righting the alleged wrongs of Versailles.|$|E

500|$|Furthermore, {{the loss}} of Nanking did not force China to capitulate as Japan's leaders had predicted. Even so, buoyed by their victory, the Japanese {{government}} replaced the lenient terms for peace which they had relayed to the mediator Ambassador Trautmann prior to the battle with an extremely harsh set of demands that were ultimately rejected by China.

Eulogizing Irving before the Massachusetts Historical Society in December 1859, his friend, the poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, acknowledged Irving's role in promoting American literature: [...] "We feel a just pride in his renown as an author, not forgetting that, to his other claims <b>upon</b> <b>our</b> gratitude, he adds also that of having been the first to win for our country an honourable name and position in the History of Letters".|$|E
