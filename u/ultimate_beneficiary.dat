50|$|On 20 May 1905, {{three months}} after Louis Huth’s death, a {{significant}} part of his collection of eighteenth and nineteenth-century paintings was sold at Christie’s. The sale did not include any works by Whistler, although some of them had already been sold, but did include a large number by Watts, although not his portrait of Mrs Huth. Her portrait by Whistler is {{in the collection of the}} Viscount Cowdray having apparently been sold to Weetman Pearson, 1st Viscount Cowdray, in 1923 (a year before Louis' widow died) by Edward Huth, a nephew of Louis Huth. In that regard, Louis' will is instructive. Louis and Helen Huth had no children. Louis left £100,000 to his partners in the firm of Frederick Huth and Co., which included two nephews (one of them being Edward Huth) and one great-nephew (Frederick Huth Jackson), albeit Louis' widow, Helen, took a life interest in the income from that sum; she also received £4,000 and the London house in Mayfair, as well as certain other personal effects at Possingworth and Mayfair. Louis bequeathed her a life-interest in the family portraits (those at Possingworth and at Mayfair) and in the furniture and pictures at the house in Mayfair; upon her death the family portraits were to become the property of Louis' nephew, Edward Huth. Given her life-interest in the family portraits, Helen How must have agreed with her late husband's nephew Edward, the <b>ultimate</b> <b>beneficiary</b> of the family portraits, that he could sell her portrait by Whistler to Viscount Cowdray the year before Helen died. Edward would have been required also to agree to Helen’s private sale to Sir Hugh Lane of one of her portraits by George Watts, who gave it to the Dublin City Gallery in 1908. Helen's death resulted in the 'termination of life interest' and the artworks remaining with her were sold in April 1925.|$|E
5000|$|The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) accused NPF {{accountant}} Rojoa {{of conspiracy}} with Lesage. Charged with embezzlement and money laundering, Lesage involved two top {{managers of the}} MCB. He was later granted immunity by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC). Attempts were made to challenge the immunity since {{it had not been}} granted or confirmed by the Director of Public Prosecution. As the investigation unfolded, ICAC identified the main beneficiary as London-based Mauritian businessman Teeren Appassamy. Money was credited to accounts of ten companies and five persons including Appassamy, the alleged master swindler. They are Ravi Ramdewar, his solicitor; former civil servant and consultant to the Mauritius Commercial Bank, Dev Manraj, his companies’ director; economist Donald Ha Yeung, his agent; and his brother, Tamby Appasamy. They, as well as MCB top managers, were provisionally charged. Teeren Appasamy pointed MCB General Manager, Pierre-Guy Noël, as the banker he had dealings with. The latter was charged of having “willfully and criminally conspired with Robert Lesage and Teeren Appasamy to engage in several transactions involving a sum of Rs 36 million”. This charge was later struck out on a technicality. MCB's Assistant General Manager, Philippe A. Forget was charged with “failing to report a suspicious transaction” as file manager for two companies of Teeren Appasamy. Philippe Forget, also a major shareholder of the prominent newspaper L'Express (Mauritius), was arrested and released on bail. Charges against Forget were eventually changed and then struck out. The fraud action was soon followed by a claim by MCB in Mauritius against Mauritius Union Assurance (MUA) under its insurance policies. MUA in turn claimed against its reinsurers, Dornoch Ltd., and others. On 19 January 2005 the reinsurers rejected MUA's claim because of negligent misstatement, non-disclosure, and deceit. They later served proceedings against MUA and MCB. The allegations of misrepresentation made against MUA and MCB were [...] "based upon answers given in a Lloyds bankers policy proposal form signed by officers of MCB to the effect that it was a well run orthodox banking business when in fact it was nothing of the sort." [...] MUA and MCB appealed to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, and their appeal was dismissed. In March 2005, a report by NTan Advisory Corporate (Singapore) was published in Le Mauricien. The report commissioned by the Bank of Mauritius, outlined unlawful banking practices at the Mauritius Commercial Bank. In October 2008, after reviewing evidence gathered by ICAC, the Director of Public Prosecution Gérard Angoh decided not to retain criminal charges against Lesage. In September 2009, ICAC initiated criminal action against the Mauritius Commercial Bank, as a corporate entity represented by Pierre-Guy Noël. MCB was charged to [...] "wilfully, unlawfully and criminally fail to take such measures as are reasonably necessary, to wit : implementation of proper internal control systems and procedures, to ensure that services offered by it, to wit : in relation to the fixed deposit accounts held on behalf of the National Pensions Fund, were not capable of being used by a person to facilitate the commission of a money laundering offence. On 30 June 2010, in the civil action brought about by MCB against Lesage and others, Judges Paul Lam Shang Leen and Nirmala Devat of the Commercial Division of the Supreme Court, found that Lesage could not be believed and held him liable for the Rs 880 million fraud at the MCB. The justices ordered him to refund Rs 436 million to the bank. The co-defendant and <b>ultimate</b> <b>beneficiary</b> of the fraud, Teeren Appasamy, was ordered by the Court to pay the bank a sum of Rs 305 million. Donald Ha Yeung, was exonerated of all blame by the judges. Lesage appealed to the Supreme Court of Mauritius, but his appeal was denied on a technicality. He then appealed directly to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London, UK, the highest court of appeal. On Dec. 20, 2012, Lord Kerr and four other Law Lords allowed Lesage's appeal, quashing the decision of the Supreme Court of Mauritius and ordering a new trial [...] "free from the taint of unfairness and bias" [...] before a differently constituted court.|$|E
