This manuscript version is made available under the CC-BY-NC-ND 4. 0 license [URL] To apply the Masmali tear ferning (TF) grading scale on non-dry eye (NDE) and dry eye (DE) subjects to test {{the validity of the}} grading scale in practice, and to describe the grading scale range for NDE and DE. Method: Forty NDE subjects (20 males, 20 females) and 40 DE subjects (23 males, 17 females) ranging in age from 19 to 53 years (mean ± SD: 25. 3 ± 5. 5) with no other ocular disease, no contact lens wear, and not pregnant or breastfeeding were recruited. McMonnies scores were <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>subject</b> <b>grouping.</b> Phenol red thread (PRT) and slit-lamp test were used. A tear sample was collected from right eye, which was then dried to produce a ferning pattern, that was observed using a digital microscope, and graded. Results: Mean McMonnies, PRT and TF grade in NDE subjects were 7. 1 ± 3. 8, 27. 4 ± 4. 3 mm and 0. 78 ± 0. 40, respectively. Median McMonnies, PRT and TF grade in DE subjects were 16. 5 ± 3. 0, 9. 0 ± 2. 0 mm and 2. 3 ± 1. 48, respectively. In NDE subjects, grades 0. 0 – 1. 8 were observed (82. 5 % Grade 0. 0 – 1. 00). Grades 2. 0 – 4. 0 were observed in DE subjects (72. 5 % Grades 2. 0 – 3. 0). For all subjects, there were large correlations between TF grade and PRT (r = − 0. 79), PRT and McMonnies (r = − 0. 60), and TF and McMonnies (r = 0. 73). Conclusions: The Masmali TF grading scale showed good validity in describing the TF patterns. Grades ≥ 2 can be classified as abnormal patterns. The TF test {{has the potential to be}} used in the clinic...|$|R

This study develops and utilizes a new algorithm <b>for</b> <b>grouping</b> <b>subjects</b> such that a global attitude change score is derived from the attitude change scores on each CMAQ subscale. By evaluating global attitude change in addition to the more specific attitude change on each subscale, {{it might be possible to}} better comprehend the effects of crew resource management training on pilot attitudes...|$|R

Male predominance among the patients was noted to be greater at ages 40 - 69 years than at other ages and greater for tumours of the upper two thirds of the stomach than for tumours that arose distally...|$|R
