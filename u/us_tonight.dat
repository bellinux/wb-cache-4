In 1999 President Clinton awarded Bentsen the Presidential Medal of Freedom, {{one of the}} nation's highest honors given to civilians.

40|$|The Boyd School of Law is {{a vibrant}} place, and our {{trajectory}} continues to move {{strongly in the}} right direction. One {{of the things that}} has been so important to us is the excellent support we have received from so many in and around Nevada. An example of that support brings <b>us</b> together <b>tonight.</b> The Wiegand Foundation has endowed a professorship at the Law School to support the study of tax law. I am fortunate to be the current holder of that professorship. This address is the first formal event memorializing the Wiegand Foundation’s support for scholarship and for Law School. My thanks and the School’s thanks to the Wiegand Foundation for its support and for what that support will enable. Our topic is simplification of the federal tax law, particularly the federal income tax. Simplification has been called the “Holy Grail” of tax policy. Like the Grail, simplification is both important and elusive. Quests for both are easy to start but difficult to bring to successful conclusion. We will consider the topic from five perspectives. First, the federal income tax is now our main tax, and it probably will continue to be. So, our attention should be on fixing the income tax to the greatest extent possible. Second, in fixing the income tax, simplification should be a high priority. Third, effective simplification requires putting heavy emphasis - far more than it receives today - on administrability. Fourth, we 2 ̆ 7 ll consider precedents: examples of administrability-based income tax provisions already in the Code. Finally, I’ll offer three administrability-based simplifying income tax reforms that could be effected immediately...|$|R

Production on the album then moves on to a senual midtempo ballad, [...] "Silhouette" [...]The song sees Sparks using her falsetto vocals by channeling Mariah Carey's earlier work adopting her [...] "most agile coos". Sparks takes it to the bedroom in speaks of the descriptive and intimate moments she is sharing with her lover [...] " [...] There's no space between <b>us</b> / <b>Tonight</b> we'll be seamless / Painting perfect pictures of what's going on in this bed / Insatiable shadows revealed by the candles / You and me and our silhouette".|$|R

Most of these characters have broken or unfulfilled dreams, and the pianist's job is to help them [...] "forget about life for a while," [...] as the lyrics state. The pianist makes money when the patrons [...] "sit at the bar, and put bread in my jar, and say, 'Man, what are you doin' here?" [...] The chorus, in bar-room sing-along style, comes from the bar patrons themselves, who say, [...] "Sing us a song, / You're the piano man; / Sing <b>us</b> a song <b>tonight.</b> / Well, we're all in the mood for a melody, / And you've got us feeling all right." [...] As for the lyrics, Joel admitted that with their 5-lines grouping, they were more in the form of a limerick than a typical poem.|$|R
