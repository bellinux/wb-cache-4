40|$|A novel {{approach}} {{for the development}} of wideband models that take into account the parasitic effects of all interconnecting components along complete signal paths in system-in-package (SiP) modules at RF/microwave frequencies is presented. In order to develop these models, the multilumped modeling technique was used. So far, multilumped modeling has been applied only to <b>uniform</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>lines,</b> where only the fundamental mode of propagation e. g., transverse electromagnetic (TEM) or quasi-TEM, is present. However, SiP modules are very complex structures, consisting almost entirely of geometrical discontinuities that excite higher-order modes (HOMs). So, unlike in <b>uniform</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>lines</b> where only a single wave mode exists, there is a combination of TEM/quasi-TEM modes and HOMs in SiP modules. Consequently, prior to applying multilumped modeling in this work, a novel technique for defining the boundaries of all discontinuities in SiP modules was first developed. Based on these boundaries, the signal path was segmented and each segment efficiently characterized, taking into consideration electromagnetic coupling (EM) between neighboring segments. The validated models for each segment were then cascaded to generate a wideband model for the entire path. This model was also experimentally validated, and used to perform numerous signal integrity (SI) investigations at the pre-layout phase, from which design guidelines to keep SI effects within acceptable limits were derived...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an iterative and adaptive perturbation technique {{for the analysis}} of nonuniform transmission lines. Place-dependent variations of the per-unit-length parameters are interpreted as perturbations with respect to their average values along the line. This allows casting the governing equations for the corresponding perturbations of the voltages and currents as those of a <b>uniform</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>line</b> with distributed sources. Therefore, standard transmission line theory is used to calculate these perturbation terms. Specifically, perturbations of increasing order are computed iteratively starting from the solution of the unperturbed line. The accuracy is adaptively adjusted by setting a threshold on the convergence of the solution. The algorithm turns out to be simple to implement and very accurate, yet faster than traditional approaches based on the discretization of the line into uniform sections. The technique is validated through the analysis of several nonuniform transmission line structures of relevance in EMC applications, namely uniformly and nonuniformly twisted wire pairs as well as a cable bundle with lacing cords...|$|E
40|$|The "indoor" {{access network}} is {{characterized}} by several branches and impedance mismatches that cause many reflections. In the present paper, {{a new way of}} modeling the transfer function of a power line is proposed. The proposed model starts by considering the power line channel as a <b>uniform</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>line.</b> This allows the power line channel to be described as a cascade of simple two-port networks, each of which may be easily described with its transmission matrix. This approach allows us to model in the frequency domain any power line channel, regardless of its topology, by considering as special two-port networks any series or shunt impedances (i. e., branches) present along the line. This approach also implies the validity of the TEM approximation. It is possible to prove that this assumption is valid assuming correct mode excitation, which differs from conventional twisted pair. In so doing, the usual problems encountered in the time-domain characterization of the power line channel as a multipath channel can be avoided. Interestingly, the transmission matrices approach allows us also to show the existence of a particular symmetry of the power line channel that was not previously revealed [5]...|$|E

TLTs have been found to possess far wider bandwidth and much greater transmission efficiencies by arranging the windings of the TLT to have <b>uniform</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>line</b> properties. In general, these devices are widely used for matching networks for antennas and amplifiers in the HF and VHF bands [3], and their low losses (a fraction of a dB) make them especially useful in high power circuits [4]. Typical structures for TLTs consist of parallel wires [5], coaxial cable, or bifilar twisted wire pairs [6, 7], with the latter being popular as the characteristic impedance can easily be determined by the wire diameter, the insulation thickness, and to some extent, the twisting pitch [7, 8]. In the case of coaxial cable transmission line with the correct characteristic impedance for the TLT, the theoretical high frequency bandwidth limit is reached when the cable length comes into the order of a half wavelength (λ/ 2), with the overall achievable bandwidth being about a decade [6]. By introducing magnetic materials such as powdered iron or ferrite [9, 10] to the TLT, both the low frequency limit and the high frequency limit are improved [6], and when low loss, high permeability ferrites are used along with good quality semi-rigid coaxial cable, bandwidths of four decades or more are achievable [11].

Such a device is also useful in miniaturized microwave subsystems containing mixers, balanced amplifiers and phase shifters. The balun topology consists of a TEE section high pass filter (HPF) and a transmission line low pass filter (LPF) fed with a Wilkinson hybrid power divider. These filters have supplementary (i. e. 180 degree) differential phase characteristics and their slopes have been adjusted via computer to maintain this relationship over an octave band. Lumped capacitors and resistors, plus transmission line inductors are the quasi-lumped elements used in this realization. This type of network is planar and can be readily fabricated as a monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) or a thin-film hybrid microwave integrated circuit (MIC). Initial element values are obtained using a single frequency design based on Image Parameters. The HPF consists of a number of identical cascaded, lumped TEE sections and the LPF is a 90 degree <b>uniform</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>line.</b> Perfect isolation has been assumed. Next, a three-port phase optimization of the entire balun was then performed over an octave frequency band. Insertion loss was then examined.

This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} technique {{for the design}} of N-way conical line power combiners, which offers significant advantages over existing axially symmetric combining techniques. A full analytical study of conical transmission lines is done, and evaluated results are presented. These include a proof of the cutoff frequency equation, and plots of the field patterns, of higher order modes which are unavailable in literature. A coaxial fed conical line combiner for 10 inputs is proposed, designed and evaluated. The design technique relies on the <b>uniform</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>line</b> characteristics of the conical lines to eliminate the need for complex full wave optimisation, typically needed {{in the design of the}} more commonly used radial line combiners. Circuit models are instead employed to achieve a wide matched bandwidth by using optimised stepped impedance coaxial lines to feed the combining structure. The prototype developed at X-band displays more than an octave bandwidth with a return loss of better than - 14. 5 dB. Using tapered line matching sections increases the power handling capability of the combiner by eliminating sharp edges, and allows for tolerance insensitive manufacture of the structure by widening conductor spacings. Such a 10 -way prototype is developed at X-band which displays a - 18. 7 dB return loss bandwidth of 47 % with very low losses. A study is done to determine the limitations on the design of general N-way combiners, and the results are incorporated into the design technique. The full process is demonstrated by the design and simulation of a 30 -way combiner at Ku-band which displays a simulated - 20 dB return loss bandwidth of 34 %. The design technique is simple to execute and requires very little full wave analysis.
