40|$|Abstract [...] Murabahah {{contract}} is an <b>unconditional</b> <b>contract</b> of sale between the seller and buyer, where the goods, cost price, markup and payment date are clearly defined, agreed and documented. The important element {{is that the}} price in murabahah should be mutually agreed upon based on the cost and margin. This paper aims to discuss the above costs (direct and indirect) from shariah {{point of view and}} recommend the opinion which can be applied in modern murabahah transaction. This paper is a concept paper where the data from the views of shariah was gathered regarding to cost used in trading and comparison with the conventional financial cost has been made to show the direct and indirect cost in murabahah financing is accepted on unaccepted by the Shariah. The study found that the direct and indirect cost in murabahah financing is accepted by the Shariah, however it is only recommended for the cost which contributes to the product. I...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} it is {{demonstrated}} that voluntary bargaining over a collective decision under asymmetric information may well lead to ex post efficiency if the default decision is non-trivial. It {{is argued that}} the default decision may {{be interpreted as a}} 'simple' contract that the parties have written ex ante. This result is used in order to show that simple <b>unconditional</b> <b>contracts</b> which are renegotiated may allow the hold-up problem to be solved, even if the parties' valuations are private information. ...|$|R
40|$|We take {{a dynamic}} {{perspective}} on insurance markets under adverse selection and study a generalized Rothschild and Stiglitz model where agents may differ {{with respect to}} the accidental probability and their expenditure levels in case an accident occurs. We investigate the nature of dynamic insurance contracts by considering both conditional and <b>unconditional</b> dynamic <b>contracts.</b> An <b>unconditional</b> dynamic <b>contract</b> has insurance companies offering contracts where the terms of the contract depend on time, but not on the occurrence of past accidents. Conditional dynamic contracts make the actual contract also depend on individual past performance (like in car insurances). We investigate whether allowing insurance companies to offer dynamic insurance contracts results in Pareto- improvements over static contracts. Our main results are as follows. When agents only differ in their accidental expenditures, then dynamic insurance contracts yield a welfare improvement only if dynamic contracts are conditional on past performance. When, however, agents' expenditures differ just a little bit dynamic insurance contracts are strictly Pareto improving even for <b>unconditional</b> dynamic <b>contracts...</b>|$|R
40|$|We take {{a dynamic}} {{perspective}} on insurance markets under adverse selection and study a dynamic {{version of the}} Rothschild and Stiglitz model. We investigate the nature of dynamic insurance contracts by considering both conditional and <b>unconditional</b> dynamic <b>contracts.</b> An <b>unconditional</b> dynamic <b>contract</b> has insurance companies offering contracts where {{the terms of the}} contract depend on time, but not on the occurrence of past accidents. Conditional dynamic contracts make the actual contract also depend on individual past performance (such as in car insurances). We show that dynamic insurance contracts yield a welfare improvement only if they are conditional on past performance. With conditional contracts, the first-best can be approximated if the contract lasts long. Moreover, this is true for any fraction of low-risk agents in the population.

40|$|The {{literature}} on the licensing of an innovation has mainly focused on some speci c contract types. We show {{within the framework of}} a fairly general model that removing these contractual limitations will lead to extreme market outcomes. Speci cally, we nd that when the patentee can employ observable contracts that can condition on market entry, it can achieve the monopoly outcome. Furthermore, when the patentee can only use <b>unconditional</b> quantity forcing <b>contracts,</b> it captures the entire market, albeit not at monopoly price, via a single licensee. Our results point out to the signi cance, and perhaps the particularity, of observable, nonrenegotiable contracts...|$|R
40|$|Among attorneys, judges, {{and legal}} academics, there is virtual {{consensus}} that the widespread use by business firms of standard-form contracts in their dealings with consumers has completely eliminated bargaining in consumer contracts. I believe that this perception is false, that rather than precluding bargaining and negotiation, standard-form contracts in fact facilitate bargaining and are a crucial instrument in the establishment and maintenance of cooperative relationships between firms and their customers. On this view, which I elaborate below, firms use clear and <b>unconditional</b> standard form <b>contract</b> terms not because they will insist upon those terms, but because they have given their managerial employees the discretion to grant exceptions from the standard-form terms on a case-by-case basis. In practice, acting through its agents, a firm will often provide benefits to consumers who complain beyond those that its standard form obligates it to provide, and it will forgive consumer breach of standard-form terms. Firms do this because they {{have an interest in}} building and maintaining cooperative, value-enhancing relationships with their customers. Were firms legally required to extend such benefits or forgiveness-as would result either from judicial invalidation of the tough standard-form performance terms or legislatively mandated generous standard-form performance terms-then both firms and their customers would be worse off...|$|R
