50|$|Engraving is {{a process}} that {{requires}} a design to be cut into a plate made of a relatively hard material. It is a technology with a long history and requires significant skill and experience. The finished plate is usually covered in ink, and then the ink is removed from all of the <b>un-etched</b> portions of the plate. The plate is then pressed into paper under substantial pressure. The result is a design that is slightly raised {{on the surface of the}} paper and covered in ink. Due to the cost of the process and expertise required, many consumers opt for thermographic printing, a process that results in a similarly raised print surface, but through different means at less cost.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} on polymer optical fibre (POF) has caught considerable attention and interests {{due to its}} great potential for sensing applications. Aiming at single-mode polymer optical fibre Bragg grating (POFBG) for high sensitivity sensing applications, etched POF is focussed in this research. The techniques and properties of etched single-mode POFs and their applications for high sensitivity sensors are investigated in this thesis. In this research, we established {{for the first time}} that solvent etching can lead to a significant change in the material properties of the fibre such as Young's modulus and thermal expansion coefficient. Experimental results demonstrated that the material properties of the POF can be significantly changed when the POF diameter is reduced by solvent etching. We have found that the etching induced changes in the POF material property can lead to the inscription of better quality gratings. It is experimentally demonstrated that gratings based on etched POF exhibit higher reflectivity with a shorter exposure time compared to <b>un-etched</b> ones. The property change observed is also beneficial to enhance the intrinsic sensitivity of FBG inscribed in etched POFs towards various sensing parameters. It is experimentally confirmed that the sensors based on etched POFs exhibit enhanced intrinsic sensitivity compared to <b>un-etched</b> ones. We have also proposed and demonstrated a simple and cost effective sensing configuration for simultaneous sensing based on a POFBG pair, with one grating in the etched and the other in the <b>un-etched</b> region of POF. The POFBG pair is inscribed using a single phase mask and by tuning the strain in the fibre. Moreover, the intrinsic hydrostatic pressure sensitivity of single-mode POFBG is tested for the first time and the measured sensitivity is 0. 20 pm/kPa. It is many times higher than silica-based FBGs, confirming what we would expect in POFBG. We have also investigated the viscoelastic behaviours of POFBG under static and dynamic excitations and observed time-dependent hysteresis behaviour with different applied strain. In summary, this thesis research paves the way towards the development of high quality, high sensitivity etched POFBGs that can be utilized in a wide range of sensing applications...|$|E
40|$|Self etching primers, due to ease of manipulation, {{have been}} {{extensively}} used in recent years. These self etching primers containing a relatively weak acid, may not provide an optimal bond strength. The {{purpose of the}} present in-vitro investigation was to evaluate the effects of 37 % phosphoric acid application prior to applying self etching primers on composite bond strength. In this experimental study a total of 48 premolar and molar teeth, free of caries, filling, abrasion, crack or other dental defects were selected. The extracted teeth were immediately stored in physiologic serum and divided randomly into two equal groups (n= 24). Each group was also divided into two subgroups of twelve teeth each as follows: Subgroup A: enamel was not acid-etched, subgroup B: enamel was acid-etched (group I). Subgroup C: dentin was not acid- etched, subgroup D: dentin was acid-etched (group II). In acid-conditioned groups, water rinsing was followed by the application of a bonding agent (Etch & Primer 3), however for non-acid-treated groups, just the bonding agent was used. Then composite resin blocks (1. 5 × 2 mm and 2. 5 mm in diameter) were formed and light cured at all directions for 40 seconds, following this the specimens were placed in an Instron universal testing machine to determine shear bond strength. The data were analyzed by t-test. Results showed that no statistically significant differences were between the mean values of etch and <b>un-etch</b> enamel (P= 0. 232), similarly those of etch and <b>un-etch</b> dentin (P= 0. 148). In this investigation we concluded that acidic components employed in self-etching primers were of weak type, but self-etching primers could be used without phosphoric acid conditioning...|$|R

By slightly etching the ZnO nanowires prior to mu c-Si : H deposition, mu c-Si : H films were coated uniformly on the surface of ZnO nanowires.

The process of fabrication demonstrates an optimized etching based method to fabricate single mode fiber (SMF) optic sensors in specified constant time and temperature. We propose a single mode optical fiber based temperature sensor, where the temperature sensing region is obtained by etching its cladding diameter over small length to a critical value. It is observed that the light transmission through etched fiber at 1550 nm wavelength optical source becomes highly temperature sensitive, compared to the temperature insensitive behavior observed in <b>un-etched</b> fiber for the range on 30 ºC to 100 ºC at 1550 nm.

To confirm that the material properties of etched polymer fibre can be modified and its sensitivity enhanced, sensing characteristics of different etched POFBGs for pressure, strain and temperature are investigated. From the experimental results, we show that the sensors based on etched polymer fibres exhibit a higher sensitivity and they are more desirable than the <b>un-etched</b> ones for biomedical applications.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} optional phosphoric acid etching on the shear bond strength (SBS) of two self-etch adhesives to enamel and dentin. Material and MethodsNinety-six bovine mandibular incisors were ground flat to obtain enamel and dentin substrates. A two-step self-etch adhesive (FL-Bond II) and a one-step self-etch adhesive (BeautiBond) were applied with and without a preliminary acid etching to both the enamel and dentin. The specimens were equally and randomly assigned to 4 groups per substrate (n= 12) as follows: FL-Bond II etched; FL-Bond II un-etched; BeautiBond etched; BeautiBond <b>un-etched.</b> Composite cylinders (Filtek Z 100) were bonded onto the treated tooth structure. The shear bond strength was evaluated after 24 hours of storage (37 &# 176;C, 100 % humidity) with a testing machine (Ultra-tester) at a speed of 1 mm/min. The data was analyzed using a two-way ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey's test with a significance level of p< 0. 05. A field emission scanning electron microscope {{was used for the}} failure mode analysis. ResultsBoth adhesives evidenced a significant decrease in the dentin SBS with the use of an optional phosphoric acid-etching step (p< 0. 05). Preliminary phosphoric acid etching yielded significantly higher enamel SBS for FL-Bond II (p< 0. 05) only, but not for BeautiBond. FL-Bond II applied to <b>un-etched</b> dentin demonstrated the highest mean bond strength (37. 7 &# 177; 3. 2 MPa) and BeautiBond applied to etched dentin showed the lowest mean bond strength (18. 3 &# 177; 6. 7 MPa) among all tested groups (p< 0. 05). ConclusionThe use of a preliminary acid-etching step with 37. 5 % phosphoric acid had a significant adverse effect on the dentin bond strength of the self-etch adhesives evaluated while providing improvement on the enamel bond strength only for FL-Bond II. This suggests that the potential benefit that may be derived from an additional etching step with phosphoric acid does not justify the risk of adversely affecting the bond strength to dentin...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{synthesis}} and characterization of Ge-Te-Sb (GST) thin films. The films were deposited using a Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) method and mainly characterized with XRD, SEM, AFM and TEM. For amorphous and polycrystalline films, <b>un-etched</b> Si(100) was used. The amorphous films showed a similar crystallization behavior as films deposited with sputtering and evaporation techniques. When depositing GST on <b>un-etched</b> Si(100) substrates at elevated substrate temperatures (130 - 240 °C), polycrystalline but highly textured films were obtained. The preferred growth orientation was either GST(111) or GST(0001) depending on if the films were cubic or hexagonal. Epitaxial films were prepared on crystalline substrates. On KCl(100), a mixed growth of hexagonal GST(0001) and cubic GST(100) was observed. The hexagonal phase dominates at low temperatures whereas the cubic phase dominates at high temperatures. The cubic phase is accompanied with a presumed GST(221) orientation when the film thickness exceeds ~ 70 nm. Epitaxial films were obtained with deposition rates as high as 250 nm/min. On BaF 2 (111), only (0001) oriented epitaxial hexagonal GST films are found, independent of substrate temperature, frequency or deposition background pressure. At high substrate temperatures there is a loss of Ge and Te which shifts the crystalline phase from Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 towards GeSb 2 Te 4. GST films deposited at room temperature on BaF 2 (111) were in an amorphous state, but after exposure to an annealing treatment they crystallize in an epitaxial cubic structure. Film deposition on pre-cleaned and buffered ammonium fluoride etched Si(111) show growth of epitaxial hexagonal GST, {{similar to that of}} the deposition on BaF 2 (111). When the Si-substrates were heated directly to the deposition temperature films of high crystal-line quality were obtained. An additional heat treatment of the Si-substrates prior to deposition deteriorated the crystal quality severely. The gained results show that PLD can be used as a method in order to obtain high quality epitaxial Ge-Sb-Te films from a compound target and using high deposition rates...|$|E

40|$|Microfluidics is a {{promising}} {{technology that is}} used extensively in biomedical devices, so called lab-on-a-chip devices. These devices harness a network of microchannels to mix, react, and conduct fluid flow. Most microchannel fabrication methods produce a stochastic surface roughness with heights ranging in the micro- to nano- scale. This inherent, stochastic roughness can potentially be harnessed to enhance microfluidic operations. Previous research on rough surfaces in microfluidics has focused on periodic, micro-scale obstructions, not of any stochastic nature. The purpose {{of this research is}} to characterize the effect of stochastic nano-scale surface roughness on microfluidic flow using very large-scale direct numerical simulations (DNS) and micro- particle image velocimetry (micro-PIV). The two studies are focused on a microchannel with one of the walls, the bottom surface, which has a manufactured surface roughness using a hydrofluoric-acid (HF) etching process. The rough surface is scanned by an optical profilometer, and the exact topography is imported as the bottom surface of the computational microchannel. HF-acid etched glass and <b>un-etched</b> glass surfaces are directly compared to each other. In the first study, the DNS simulations are compared to micro-PIV experiments for a Newtonian fluid (water). The flow regime was laminar, diffusion dominated and limited to Re 3 ̆c 10. The second study used a longer microchannel relative to the first study that was made possible by stitching together consecutive profilometer surface scans. This study only used simulations to study the effect of nano-scale roughness on microfluidic flow (with the previous study forming a basis for model validation). In the future, the study will be extended to Newtonian as well as non-Newtonian (shear-thinning) fluids in the same flow regime as the first study. Overall, we have shown that an experimentally validated and experimentally driven three-dimensional computational study for microfluidic stochastic surface roughness is possible. Additionally, we have shown that the stochastic nature of the surface roughness and its effect on fluid flow can be characterized with numerous tools including velocity-perturbation contours, autocorrelation length (ACL), and energy spectra analysis. The different analyses illustrated the effect of the rough surface in different ways. Velocity-perturbation contours showed that both the etched and <b>un-etched</b> rough surfaces produced very small velocity structures (eddies) very near the rough surface that merge to form larger structures as the height above the rough surface increases. The velocity-perturbation contours revealed an increase in the magnitude of the velocity perturbations by an order of magnitude by using the etched glass, which was directly caused by the increase in roughness height from HF etching. The ACL analyses also showed how the surface roughness produces small perturbation structures that merge and persist well into the midplane of the microchannel. Energy spectra analyses revealed a transfer of energy caused by the structures of the rough surfaces. Notably for the same Reynolds number, the etched surface produced velocity-perturbation structures that contained more energy and persisted higher into the microchannel compared to the <b>un-etched</b> surface. This research has shown that a chemical etching surface treatment and other stochastic rough surfaces, even at the nano-scale, have an effect on microfluidic flow that can be characterized and potentially be harnessed across a range of fluid flow rates. Devices that use microchannels such as lab-on-a-chip medical devices can therefore be tuned and optimized for their respective applications such as reagent mixing, bubble creation and transport, fluid transport, and cell manipulation using stochastic surface roughness...|$|E

30|$|In this paper, the {{formation}} of Ga droplets on photo-lithographically patterned GaAs (100) and {{the control of the}} size and density of Ga droplets by droplet epitaxy using molecular beam epitaxy are demonstrated. In extension of our previous result from the journal Physical Status Solidi A, volume 209 in 2012, the sharp contrast of the size and density of Ga droplets is clearly observed by high-resolution scanning electron microscope, atomic force microscope, and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry. Also, additional monolayer (ML) coverage is added to strength the result. The density of droplets is an order of magnitude higher on the trench area (etched area), while the size of droplets is much larger on the strip top area (<b>un-etched</b> area). A systematic variation of ML coverage results in an establishment of the control of size and density of Ga droplets. The cross-sectional line profile analysis and root mean square roughness analysis show that the trench area (etched area) is[*]approximately[*]six times rougher.

40|$|As {{semiconductor}} lithography {{is pushed}} to smaller dimensions, process yields tend to suffer due to subwavelength topographical imaging effects. Three dimensional or “thick mask ” effects result in {{such things as}} a pitch dependent best focus and, for alternating phase shift masks (AltPSMs), an intensity imbalance between etched and <b>un-etched</b> features. Corrective mask structures such as the dual trench AltPSM have been introduced to compensate for such intensity imbalances. In this work, the compensation of thick mask effects is explored using the manipulation of the pupil wavefront through the addition of spherical aberration. The wavefront has been experimentally varied through the manipulation of the lens aberration {{in a state of}} the art full field scanner. Results reveal that the influence of spherical aberration on best focus is predictable, allowing focus deviation through pitch to be tuned. Simulations further predict that aberration manipulation can provide compensation for thick mask effects by increasing the useable depth of focus for a particular set of features on both AltPSM and thicker film attenuated PSM masks. Such pupil wavefront correction has the potential to compensate for mask topography by matching thick mask effects to those of thin masks...|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} Ga+-focused ion beam (FIB) about {{functional}} properties of continuous and nanostructured piezoelectric thin films of {{lead zirconate titanate}} (Pb(ZrxTi 1 -x) O 3) was investigated. A suitable way to fabricate piezoelectric nanocapacitors was studied, based on the amorphous or crystallized state of the film before etching. Strong modification of structural and electrical behavior for area exposed to ion irradiation is observed when the film is etched in the crystallized state. Both the implantation of Ga+ ions and the film amorphization highlighted by Raman spectroscopy and Kelvin force microscopy analyses can explain this result. The piezoactivity detected by piezoresponse force microscopy is fully destroyed even after a post-annealing treatment. In the case of amorphous etched film, no significant degradation is observed. The latter process is used to successfully fabricate Pb(ZrxTi 1 -x) O 3 -based nanocapacitors by means of FIB method. In 50 -nm-size capacitors, the local electromechanical behavior is measured at similar level that the one obtained for the <b>un-etched</b> film, evidencing no manifest sidewall effect or FIB-induced damages.

30|$|The {{fabrication}} of epitaxial QNSs is inherently {{dependent on the}} size, shape, and density of initial liquid phase metal droplets (MDs) and consequently, {{the control of the}} density and size of MDs becomes an essential research focus. The control of droplets on planar substrates has been somewhat widely studied[9 – 23, 36, 37]; however, the {{fabrication of}} MDs on patterned surfaces lacks its investigation. This very naturally puts the control of MDs on patterned substrate as an attractive and essential research topic. In this paper, therefore, in extension of our previous results[38, 39], we extend the results of the sharp contrast of the size and density of Ga MDs on photo-lithographically patterned GaAs (100) by D-E approach using MBE. As evidenced by 3 -D atomic force microscope (AFM) and high-resolution scanning electron microscope (SEM), the sharp contrast of the size and density of Ga MDs is clearly observed, showing an order magnitude higher density on the trench area (the etched area). Conversely, the size is much larger on strip top area (the <b>un-etched</b> area). By systematically varying the monolayer (ML) coverage, we demonstrate the control of size and density of Ga MDs on patterned GaAs (100) surface. The atomic surface roughness is around six times higher on the trench area (etched area) based on the cross-sectional line profile and root mean square (RMS) roughness analysis. The sharp contrast of size and density of Ga MDs is discussed in terms of surface adatom diffusion.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This study {{examines}} {{the effects of}} feldspar contamination of different extent (by fluoro-silicic acid etching for different time periods and mixing pure quartz with different percentage of <b>un-etched</b> grains) on blue-light stimulated luminescence (BLSL) of quartz (38 - 63 µm) for Chinese loess. In particular, the De values and the shape of growth curves will be examined. The results show that: (1) The De determined using feldspar in Chinese loess is obviously underestimated, and infra-red stimulated luminescence (IRSL) has a greater underestimation than BLSL. For aliquots with no fluorosilicic acid etching, an IRSL De underestimation of ~ 30 % is observed for a sample with an ex-pected age of ~ 22 ka, ~ 19 % underestimation for BLSL, and ~ 10 % for post-IR BLSL. For quartz BLSL, the contamination of feldspar, which has not dissolved by fluorosilicic acid etching, will inevi-tably lead to age underestimation. We suggest that the IR-checking should be performed for every single aliquot. An aliquot should be excluded from the final De calculation if obvious IRSL signal was observed. (2) For the sample under examination blue LED stimulation can reset both IRSL and BLSL signals of feldspars, while IR stimulation cannot reset the BLSL of feldspars. (3) For multiple-mineral aliquot the growth curve shape of the post-IR BLSL {{is different from that}} of the IRSL, and within 25 Gy it is identical to that of the pure quartz BLSL.

The species investigated were F, Br, Na, Si, Sri, In, O, Cl, S and Te, and {{for the purpose of}} comparison, some of the structures were investigated in their as-grown state. It has been shown that while Si concentration profiles are similar to those for structures grown on glass, Na was more than one order of magnitude lower when sapphire was used as substrate instead of glass. This demonstrates that Na diffused from the glass substrate. Moreover, the overall Na concentration in structures with and without CdCl 2 treatment showed that Na also originated from the CdCl 2, which is in accordance with our recently reported studies of impurities in CdCl 2. The concentration of Br was found to be at least 10 times higher in the etched structures compared to the <b>un-etched</b> ones, especially near the CdTe surface where there was a clearly resolved diffusion profile. In the CdTe active layer, the concentration of F was about 4 x 10 (15) cm(- 3) with a relatively flat level but with surface segregation following heat treatment. Finally, the potential diffusion of Sri and In from the sputtered SnO 2 /ITO:F TCO layer into the CdTe active layer was investigated. It was found that there was no measurable diffusion of Sri from the SnO 2 layer into CdTe. Moreover, the SnO 2 layer {{played an important role in}} preventing the diffusion of In from the In-containing TCO layer...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the capacity of}} seven self-etching adhesives (SEAs) to demineralize ground enamel in comparison with traditional phosphoric acid etchant (PAE) using SEM and statistical analysis. Materials and methods: 80 caries-free extracted human third molars were divided into 8 groups (n = 10). Enamel bur-cut surfaces were prepared and, strictly following the manufacturers’ instructions, treated with three priming agents of two-step self-etching adhesives: Aqua Resulcin Prime (Group 1); Peak™ (Group 2); Clearfil Protect Bond (Group 3); four one-step self-etch (all-in-one) adhesives, G-Bond (Group 4); Artegral One (Group 5); Clearfil S 3 Bond (Group 6); Adper Easy Bond (Group 7); and phosphoric acid etching (Control group). The etch patterns for the SEA systems were determined by rinsing off the material with water, acetone and alcohol. A minimum of 15 specimens was used for each group. Morphology matches were made between each SEA system and PAE by means of ultrastructural SEM analysis and were computed using the Kruskal–Wallis test (P < 0. 05). Results: SEM images showed that two-step-self-etching adhesives (Groups 1 – 3) produced a regular pattern over a considerable surface area and depth, not concerning, however, the prismless layer of enamel in the fissure space; one-step self-etch adhesives (Groups 4 – 7) demonstrated similar morphological features; an uneven demineralization pattern was observed in the PAE group with <b>un-etched</b> prismless enamel in {{the depth of the}} fissures. The Kruskal–Wallis test demonstrated no statistically significant difference among the groups (P = 0. 43). Conclusions: Despite the enamel etching pattern being similar for all SEAs used, two-step self-etching systems containing phosphate derivative monomers were the most efficient self-etching agents with a more homogeneous and regular pattern of demineralization when compared to the traditional PAE...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSilicon-on-insulator (SOI) {{offers an}} {{unprecedented}} miniaturization capability and unique potential compatibility with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. Specifically, the SOI platform with 220 nm thick Si layer {{is widely used}} {{for the implementation of}} state-of-the-art photonic circuits. However, recent studies suggest that thicker Si layers may be advantageous in terms of performance, and fabrication tolerances. Nevertheless, efficiently coupling light to and from SOI circuits with Si thickness of a few hundred nanometers is challenging regardless the specific value chosen. Grating couplers are a promising solution that provide robust alignment tolerances and allow wafer-scale device testing. The coupling efficiency is mainly limited by back reflections, mode mismatch between the radiated field and the optical fiber mode, and power loss due to radiation to the substrate. The back reflections and mode-mismatch limitations are typically alleviated by apodization techniques. We have recently shown that by interleaving the standard full (220 nm) and shallow etch (70 nm) trenches in a 220 nm thick silicon layer, power loss to the substrate can be reduced below 5 %, independent of the bottom oxide thickness. Here we present a novel geometry relying on this blazing effect to minimize power loss to the substrate in grating couplers implemented on 300 nm thick Si-wires with two etch depths of 150 nm and 300 nm. We remove the previously used <b>un-etched</b> region between the full and shallow trenches, resulting in a step-like profile. This new configuration increases grating strength, halving its length, while maintaining directionality in excess of 90 %. This way, we can implement apodization techniques to yield an overlap between the radiated field and the fiber mode larger than 90 % (~ 75 % for non-apodized structure). We also implement a, single-step sub-wavelength transition region that ensures back-reflections below 5 % in a 100 nm bandwidth. 5...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{influence}} of geometrical and operating parameters on the electrical characteristics of dc microcavity discharges provides insight into their controlling physics. We present here results {{of such a}} study on silicon-based microcavity discharge devices carried out in helium at pressure ranging from 100 to 1000 Torr. Different micro-reactor configurations were measured. The differences include isolated single cavities versus arrays of closely spaced cavities, various cavity geometries (<b>un-etched</b> as well as isotropically and anisotropically etched), various dimensions (100 or 150 μm cavity diameter and 0 - 150 μm depth). The electrode gap was kept constant in all cases at approximately 6 μm. The applied electric field reaches 5 × 107 Vm− 1 which results in current and power densities up to 2 Acm− 2 and 200 kWcm− 3, respectively. The number of microcavities and the microcavity depth are shown {{to be the most}} important geometrical parameters for predicting breakdown and operation of microcavity devices. The probability of initiatory electron generation which is volume dependent and the electric field strength which is depth dependent are, respectively, considered to be responsible. The cavity shape (isotropic/anisotropic) and diameter had no significant influence. The number of micro-discharges that could be ignited depends on the rate of voltage rise and pressure. Larger numbers ignite at lower frequency and pressure. In addition, the voltage polarity has the largest influence on the electrical characteristics of the micro-discharge of all parameters, which is due to both the asymmetric role of electrodes as electron emitter and the non-uniformity of the electric field resulting in different ionization efficiencies. The qualitative shape of all breakdown voltage versus pressure curves can be explained in terms of the distance over which the discharge breakdown effectively occurs as long as one understand that this distance can depend on pressure...|$|E
40|$|Schlosser Forge Co. forges low {{pressure}} turbine (LPT) cases from the nickel based superalloy 718 Plus using the ring rolling forging process. Schlosser has been experiencing low room temperature ductility {{problems in a}} number of their 718 Plus LPT cases. LPT cases are required to pass a 4 D tensile test at room temperature with a minimum of 15 percent elongation. The ductility problem was reduced by increasing the forging temperature from 1825 ˚F to 1850 ˚F. Analysis was performed on 718 Plus samples taken from forged LPT cases that failed the room temperature ductility requirement and ones that passed the requirement. The analysis required conducting grain size measurements and delta phase volume fraction measurements to relate these microstructural characteristics to low room temperature ductility. Samples of 718 Plus were mounted and polished for metallography in accordance with ASTM E 3 - 11. Samples were etched with modified Kalling’s reagent for 3 minutes and grain size measurements were taken per ASTM E 112 - 10. Grain sizes varied only slightly between the low and acceptable ductility samples, with an average grain diameter of 44. 9 μm. Grain size variation was not contributing to the low room temperature ductility problem. The samples were then re-polished to remove the previous etch and re-etched with modified Kalling’s for 30 seconds. The 30 second etch allowed the delta phase precipitates to be revealed while leaving the grain boundaries <b>un-etched.</b> Volume fraction measurements of the delta phase precipitates were taken per ASTM E 562 - 11. Results showed the low ductility sample contained the highest amount of delta, about 7. 5 percent by volume. The amount of delta was found to be inversely proportional to ductility as well as forging temperature...|$|E
