5|$|The {{architecture}} of the Windows Push Notification Service {{is similar to that}} of its predecessor, in that it consists of servers and interfaces that generate, maintain, store, and authenticate <b>unique</b> <b>identifiers</b> (called Channel URI Identifiers) for all devices that register to use the service. When a device enrolls to receive data and notification information using the WNS, it first sends a device registration request to WNS network. The WNS network acknowledges the request, and responds with the device's unique Channel URI Identifier. Typically, the device will then send its identifier to a server owned by the developer so that it can be stored and used for sending notifications. When the app developer wishes to transmit a notification or other WNS data to the device, it will transmit a POST request to the WNS network. The network will acknowledge and authenticate the request. If the authentication succeeds, the data to be transmitted is enqueued and then sent to the device from the WNS network using the Channel URI Identifier.|$|E

25|$|From late 1970, British Railways {{started to}} apply new numbers to {{locomotives}} and multiple units {{based on the}} TOPS classification system, the first classes {{to be dealt with}} being the LNER-design EM1 type (TOPS class 76) and the AL3 and AL4 types of AC electric locomotives (TOPS classes 83 and 84). The format of these numbers is xxxyyy, where xxx is the class number and yyy the unique identifier for that locomotive or unit. All locomotive classes have <b>unique</b> <b>identifiers</b> that commence at xx001, except classes 43 (High Speed Train power cars, originally classified as multiple-unit vehicles), 97 and 98 (departmental and steam locomotives). Multiple unit classes are treated differently, because an attempt has been made to give units working within the same region or sector <b>unique</b> <b>identifiers</b> (for more information see British Rail Regional Multiple Unit Numbering). In recent years, unit numbers have also been tied in with the numbers of the carriages within a unit (e.g. 150201 is formed of carriages 52201 and 57201). As a result, very few multiple unit classes commence from xxx001.|$|E

25|$|PubMed Central (PMC) {{is a free}} digital {{repository}} that archives publicly accessible full-text scholarly {{articles that}} have been published within the biomedical and life sciences journal literature. As {{one of the major}} research databases within the suite of resources that have been developed by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), PubMed Central is much more than just a document repository. Submissions into PMC undergo an indexing and formatting procedure which results in enhanced metadata, medical ontology, and <b>unique</b> <b>identifiers</b> which all enrich the XML structured data for each article on deposit. Content within PMC can easily be interlinked to many other NCBI databases and accessed via Entrez search and retrieval systems, further enhancing the public's ability to freely discover, read and build upon this portfolio of biomedical knowledge.|$|E

[...] This problem cannot occur if each version of each library is uniquely identified and each program references libraries only by their full <b>unique</b> <b>identifiers.</b> [...] The [...] "DLL hell" [...] problems with earlier Windows versions arose from using only the names of libraries, which were not guaranteed to be unique, to resolve dynamic links in programs.

2500|$|The Internet is {{a global}} network that {{comprises}} many voluntarily interconnected autonomous networks. It operates without a central governing body. The technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols (IPv4 and IPv6) is an activity of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise. To maintain interoperability, the principal name spaces of the Internet are administered by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). ICANN is governed by an international board of directors drawn from across the Internet technical, business, academic, and other non-commercial communities. ICANN coordinates the assignment of <b>unique</b> <b>identifiers</b> for use on the Internet, including domain names, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, application port numbers in the transport protocols, and many other parameters. Globally unified name spaces are essential for maintaining the global reach of the Internet. [...] This role of ICANN distinguishes it as perhaps the only central coordinating body for the global Internet.|$|E

2500|$|The DOI system offers persistent, semantically-interoperable {{resolution}} to related current data and is {{best suited to}} material {{that will be used}} in services outside the direct control of the issuing assigner (e.g., public citation or managing content of value). It uses a managed registry (providing social and technical infrastructure). It does not assume any specific business model for the provision of identifiers or services and enables other existing services to link to it in defined ways. Several approaches for making identifiers persistent have been proposed. The comparison of persistent identifier approaches is difficult because they are not all doing the same thing. Imprecisely referring to a set of schemes as [...] "identifiers" [...] doesn't mean that they can be compared easily. Other [...] "identifier systems" [...] may be enabling technologies with low barriers to entry, providing an easy to use labeling mechanism that allows anyone to set up a new instance (examples include Persistent Uniform Resource Locator (PURL), URLs, Globally <b>Unique</b> <b>Identifiers</b> (GUIDs), etc.), but may lack some of the functionality of a registry-controlled scheme and will usually lack accompanying metadata in a controlled scheme. The DOI system does not have this approach and should not be compared directly to such identifier schemes. Various applications using such enabling technologies with added features have been devised that meet some of the features offered by the DOI system for specific sectors (e.g., ARK).|$|E
