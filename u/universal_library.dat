Thanos uses information from the robot to plot against and battle Tyrant, the first creation of Galactus turned destroyer. When trapped in an alternate dimension, Thanos employs {{the aid of the}} brother of Ka-Zar, Parnival Plunder and later the Hulk to escape, although both attempts are unsuccessful. Thanos is eventually freed and comes into conflict with Thor, aligning himself with Mangog in a scheme to obtain powerful mystical and cosmic talismans which will allow him to destroy all life in the universe, and during their battles Thanos decimates the planet Rigel-3.|$|E
2500|$|Theodor Holm [...] "Ted" [...] Nelson (born 1937) is an American {{sociologist}} and [...] philosopher. In 1960 {{he founded}} Project Xanadu {{with the goal}} of creating a computer network with a simple user interface. Project Xanadu was to be a worldwide electronic publishing system using hypertext linking that would have created a <b>universal</b> <b>library.</b> In 1963 he coined the terms [...] "hypertext" [...] and [...] "hypermedia". In 1974 he wrote and published two books in one, Computer Lib/Dream Machines, that has been hailed as [...] "the most important book in the history of new media." [...] Sadly, his grand ideas from the 1960s and 1970s never became completed projects.|$|E
2500|$|Mosterín {{acquired}} {{his initial}} logical formation at the Institut für mathematische Logik und Grundlagenforschung in Münster (Germany). He published {{the first modern}} and rigorous textbooks of logic [...] and set theory [...] in Spanish. He has worked on topics of first and second order logic, axiomatic set theory, computability and complexity. He has shown how the uniform digitalization of each type of symbolic object (such as chromosomes, texts, pictures, movies or pieces of music) can be considered to implement a certain positional numbering system. This result gives a precise meaning {{to the notion that}} the set of natural numbers constitutes a <b>universal</b> <b>library</b> and indeed a universal data base. Mosterín has edited the first edition of the complete works of Kurt Gödel in any language. Together with Thomas Bonk, he has edited an unpublished book of Rudolf Carnap on axiomatics (in German). He has also delved in the historical and biographical aspects of the development of modern logic, as shown in his original work on the lives of Gottlob Frege, Georg Cantor, Bertrand Russell, John von Neumann, Kurt Gödel and Alan Turing, intertwined with [...] a formal analysis of their main technical contributions.|$|E

2500|$|Gessner {{has been}} {{described}} as the father of modern scientific botany and zoology, and the father of modern bibliography. To his contemporaries he was best known as a botanist. Despite his traveling ways and the job of maintaining his own gardens, Gesner probably {{spent most of his time}} inside his own extensive library. He listed among his History of Animals sources more than 80 Greek authors and at least 175 Latin authors, as well as works by German, French, and Italian authors. He even attempted to establish a [...] "universal library" [...] of all books in existence. The project might sound strange to the modern mind, but Gessner invested tremendous energy in the project. He sniffed through remote libraries along with the collections of the Vatican Library and catalogs of printers and booksellers. By assembling this <b>universal</b> <b>library</b> of information, Gessner put together a database centuries before computers would ease such work. He cut relevant passages out of books, grouped the cuttings by general theme, subdivided the groups into more specific categories, and boxed them. He could then retrieve and arrange the cuttings as needed. In the words of science writer Anna Pavord, [...] "He was a one-man search engine, a 16th-century Google with the added bonus of critical evaluation." ...|$|E

By applying the indicators to an exhaustive enumeration of minimal <b>universal</b> <b>libraries,</b> two dual asymmetrical operations, Logic Implication “⇒ ” and Half XOR “< ” are found to consistently outperform their symmetrical counterparts, NAND and NOR. Our expressiveness metrics bring support to the conjecture that asymmetrical operators are significantly more expressive that their well studied symmetric counterparts, omnipresent in various circuit design tools.

40|$|The {{development}} of in vitro antibody selection technologies has allowed overcoming some limitations inherent to the hybridoma technology. In most cases, large repertoires of antibody genes have been assembled to create highly diversified libraries allowing {{the isolation of}} antibodies recognizing virtually any antigen. However, these <b>universal</b> <b>libraries</b> might not allow the isolation of antibodies with specific structural properties or particular amino acid contents that are rarely found in natural repertoires. Purpose-oriented libraries specially designed to incorporate desired characteristics have been successfully used. However, the workload required for library construction has limited the attractiveness of this approach {{compared to the use}} of large <b>universal</b> <b>libraries.</b> We have developed an approach to capture synthetic or natural diversity into the complementarity determining regions 3 (CDR 3) of human antibody repertoires using Type IIS restriction enzymes. In this way, we generated several libraries either biased in amino acid content or towards long CDRH 3 loops. The latter were successfully used to identify antibodies inhibiting the enzymatic activity of horseradish peroxidase, whereas libraries enriched in histidines allowed for the isolation of antibodies binding to human Fc in a pH-dependent manner. These libraries indicate that tailored diversification of CDR 3 is sufficient to generate purpose-oriented libraries and isolate antibodies with uncommon properties...|$|R
