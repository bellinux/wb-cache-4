They often lacked satisfactory educational resources on their reservations, undermining their pursuit of marketable skills. The economic disparity between the village and <b>urban</b> <b>schools</b> resulted in imposing many social barriers on aborigines, which prevent many from moving beyond vocational training. Students transplanted into <b>urban</b> <b>schools</b> face adversity, including isolation, culture shock, and discrimination from their peers. The cultural impact of poverty and economic marginalization has led to an increase in alcoholism and prostitution among aborigines.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, primary {{education}} reform {{had become one}} of the top priorities in the People's Republic of China. About 160million Chinese people had missed all or part of their education because of the Cultural Revolution in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and in 1986 the National People's Congress enacted a law calling for nine years of compulsory education. By 1993, it was clear that much of the country was making little progress on implementing nine-year compulsory education, so the 1993–2000seven-year plan focused on this goal. One of the major challenges educators faced was the large number of rural schoolchildren dropping out to pursue work. Another issue was a large urban–rural divide: funding and teacher quality were far better in <b>urban</b> <b>schools</b> than rural, and urban students stayed in school longer.|$|E

Given the impact teacher responsiveness has on academic achievement, pre-service teacher preparation programs must provide curriculum and field experiences that work to dispel the misconceptions and negative dispositions inhibiting effective teaching practices, positive student-teacher relationships, and successful learning environments (Haberman, 2000). Restructured pre-service teacher preparation programs can nurture culturally responsive teaching practices beneficial to the <b>urban</b> <b>school</b> context where novice and pre-service teachers lack exposure and maintain unchallenged knowledge (Milner, 2012).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} current liability insurance practices for professional school corporation personnel in Indiana. Fifty rural and fifty <b>urban</b> <b>school</b> corporations were surveyed with regard to: (1) number and character of suits against school corporations or professional. school corporation personnel, (2) amount of current liability insurance protection carried by school corporations, (3) degree of legal representation of school corporations and school corporation personnel, and (4) opinions of respondents about educational malpractice. An instrument developed to gather data elicited responses from 52 percent of urban and 6 - 8 percent of rural school corporations in the sample. An analysis of data was completed to test two null hypotheses with regard to: (1) need for liability insurance and (2) employment of legal counsel. Additional data were compiled arid reported descriptively in order to draw conclusions regarding the current status of personal liability insurance protection within Indiana school corporations. Findings of the study included:Urban school corporations had a significantly greater need for liability insurance as measured by number of suits involving school corporations or professional school corporation personnel. Respondents from 57. 7 percent of <b>urban</b> <b>school</b> corporations reported involvement in at least thirty liability actions between 1972 and 1977. Respondents from 26. 5 percent of rural school corporations reported involvement in ten liability actions between 1972 and 1977. Negligence and personal injury were grounds most often reported for school related liability actions, especially in actions involving <b>urban</b> <b>school</b> corporations. Judgments rendered against rural school corporations were settled for an average of $ 9, 975. Judgments against <b>urban</b> <b>school</b> corporations were settled for an average of $ 14, 506. Written teacher dismissal policies had been established by 58. 8 percent of rural and 88. 5 percent of <b>urban</b> <b>school</b> corporations. Results of a Chi-Square test indicated that no significant difference existed between rural and <b>urban</b> <b>school</b> corporations in the employment of legal counsel. <b>Urban</b> <b>school</b> corporations pay more than twice the yearly fee for legal services dealing with personal liability than rural school corporations. Legal counsel provided by school corporations would not represent employees from almost 40 percent of Indiana school corporations in liability litigation. <b>Urban</b> <b>school</b> corporations provide for more types of liability, greater amounts of coverage, and larger deductibles for liability insurance than rural counterparts. Deductibles in excess of $ 1, 000 were obtained on 16. 9 percent of all coverages with deductibles purchased by rural school corporations and on 52. 6 percent of all coverages with deductibles purchased by <b>urban</b> <b>school</b> corporations. Four rural and nine <b>urban</b> <b>school</b> corporations reported deductibles of $ 10, 000. Amount of annual premium paid varies with type and amount of coverage, amount of deductible, school corporation enrollment, number of school officials and number of school employees covered. Rural school corporations were providing liability insurance protection at an average premium rate of $ 1. 20 per student enrolled. <b>Urban</b> <b>school</b> corporations were providing liability insurance protection at an average premium rate of $ 1. 17 per student enrolled. School officials and employees from rural school corporations which have not been involved in liability actions tend to be less wary of implications of educational malpractice than school officials and employees from <b>urban</b> <b>school</b> corporations or from rural school corporations which have been involved in liability actions.

A preference certificate from the student's parish is required for each student with their application for enrolment at the school. Under the Act, the school may enrol [...] "non-preference" [...] students but the enrolment of such students is restricted to 5% of the total roll.
