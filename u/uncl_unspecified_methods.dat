In this chapter, entitled ‘The Science of Speech Sounds’ (Lautlehre), the author has described the phonetic system of the Lithuanian dialect of the Eastern Prussian Highlanders: articulation of vowels, diphthongs and consonants; accentuation and the influence of accent on the quantity of vowels; vowel alternations in the root of the words and the main principles of the composition of sounds, i. e. hiatus, elision, variations of the word endings. Schleicher has also given a comprehensive description of the features of the Eastern Prussian dialects. Most of Schleicher’s propositions are valuable for modern phonetics. He managed to discern the subtle characteristics of sounds, to describe thoroughly sound distinctions and to understand the complexity of the phonetic system of the language which was a foreign language to him.

Classical decision modeling techniques require elicitation of too many parameter estimates and their conditional (joint) probabilities, and have not therefore been applied {{to the problem of}} identifying high-performance, cost-effective combinations of clinical options for diagnosis or treatments where many of the objectives are unknown or even <b>unspecified.</b> <b>Methods</b> We designed a Java-based software resource, the Clinical Decision Modeling System (CDMS), to implement Naïve Decision Modeling, and provide a use case based on published performance evaluation measures of various strategies for breast and lung cancer detection. Because cost estimates for many of the newer methods are not yet available, we assume equal cost. Our use case reveals numerous potentially high-performance combinations of clinical options for the detection of breast and lung cancer. Results Naïve Decision Modeling is a highly practical applied strategy which guides investigators through the process of establishing evidence-based integrative translational clinical research priorities. CDMS is not designed for clinical decision support. Inputs include performance evaluation measures and costs of various clinical options. The software finds trees with expected emergent performance characteristics and average cost per patient that meet stated filtering criteria. Key to the utility of the software is sophisticated graphical elements, including a tree browser, a receiver-operator characteristic surface plot, and a histogram of expected average cost per patient. The analysis pinpoints the potentially most relevant pairs of clinical options ('critical pairs') for which empirical estimates of conditional dependence may be critical. The assumption of independence can be tested with retrospective studies prior to the initiation of clinical trials designed to estimate clinical impact. High-performance combinations of clinical options may exist for breast and lung cancer detection. Conclusion The software could be found useful in simplifying the objective-driven planning of complex integrative clinical studies without requiring a multi-attribute utility function, and it could lead to efficient integrative translational clinical study designs that move beyond simple pair wise competitive studies. Collaborators, who traditionally might compete to prioritize their own individual clinical options, can use the software as a common framework and guide to work together to produce increased understanding on the benefits of using alternative clinical combinations to affect strategic and cost-effective clinical workflows. </p...|$|R

Das formas extrapulmonares (25. 773 casos; 17, 8 %), a pleural foi a mais referida (12. 545 casos; 48, 7 %). A incidência (por 100. 000 habitantes) de todas as formas diminuiu, (49, 7 em 1998 e 44, 6 em 2005; R² = 0, 898; p OBJECTIVE: To {{analyze the}} {{epidemiological}} characteristics of and trends regarding {{the incidence of}} pleural TB. METHODS: This was a retrospective descriptive study of TB cases reported between 1998 and 2005 and compiled from the Epidemiological Surveillance Tuberculosis System (Epi-TB database). RESULTS: A total of 144, 347 new cases of TB were reported during the period studied. Pulmonary TB was the predominant form (118, 575 cases; 82. 2 %). Among the extrapulmonary forms (25, 773 cases; 17. 8 %), pleural TB was the form most often reported (12, 545 cases; 48. 7 %). For all forms, the incidence (per 100, 000 population) decreased (from 49. 7 in 1998 to 44. 6 in 2005; R² = 0. 898; p < 0. 001), whereas the incidence of pleural TB remained stable (4. 1 in 1998 and 3. 8 in 2005; R² = 0. 433; p = 0. 076). The highest incidence of pleural TB was found among males (2 : 1) aged from 30 to 59 years.

Efficiencies of removal of beryllium contamination from typical painted surfaces were tested by wipe sampling without a wetting agent, with water-moistened wipe materials, and by methanol-moistened wipes. Analysis indicated that methanol-moistened wipe sampling removed about twice as much beryllium/oil-film surface contamination as water-moistened wipes, which removed about twice as much residue as dry wipes.

40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} problems, {{involving the}} solution of the Euler equations of motion, are presently almost exclusively solved using an Euler formulation. This requires the generation of a spatial grid over which the problem is discretized. The grid generation process adds to the complexity to the problem being solved, {{especially in the case of}} complex body-shapes with flow discontinuities, such as shock waves and sliplines. ALso, the Euler formulation is difficult to use for the aerodynamic problems of unspecified geometry. A Lagrangian formulation permits to avoid the complexity of a grid generation while making it possible to obtain very accurate results. This Lagrangian formulation use the stream function and Lagrangian distance to represent the flow instead of the Cartesian coordinates. Thus, the streamlines become coordinate lines in the Lagrangian formulation, which can easily represent complex body-shapes and sliplines, and is also more suitable to solve complex problems involving bodies of <b>unspecified</b> geometry. This <b>method</b> was tested and validated against several test problems of specified geometry, including the supersonic flows with shock waves in a duct with a circular arc bump and past airfoils, as well as the flow in a nozzle. The solutions obtained with this Lagrangian method were found to be very accurate, displaying a high at a computational efficiency (actually providing second-order accuracy at a computational load of a first order solution). Then, this Lagrangian method has been used to solve several aerodynamic problems with geometrically-unspecified body-shape, such as (i) the determination of the geometry of a bump corresponding to a specified pressure distribution in supersonic flow, and (ii) the design of the geometry of a supersonic nozzle, based on the reflection-suppression condition, for a specified uniform flow at exit...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, the {{development}} of follow-on biological products (biosimilars) has received increasing attention. The dissertation covers statistical methods related to three topics of Non-inferiority (NI), Bioequivalence (BE) and Equivalence in demonstrating biosimilarity. For NI, {{one of the key}} requirements is constancy assumption, that is, the effect of reference treatment is the same in current NI trials as in historical superiority trials. However if a covariate interacts with the treatment arms, then changes in distribution of this covariate will result in violation of constancy assumption. We propose a modified covariate-adjustment fixed margin method, and recommend it based on its performance characteristics in comparison with other methods. Topic two is related to BE inference for log-normal distributed data. Two drugs are bioequivalent if the difference of a pharmacokinetics (PK) parameter of two products falls within prespecified margins. In the presence of <b>unspecified</b> variances, existing <b>methods</b> like two one-sided tests and Bayesian analysis in BE setting limit our knowledge on the extent that inference of BE is affected by the variability of the PK parameter. We propose a likelihood approach that retains the unspecified variances in the model and partitions the entire likelihood function into two components: F-statistic function for variances and t-statistic function for difference of PK parameter. The advantage of the proposed method over existing methods is it helps identify range of variances where BE {{is more likely to be}} achieved. In the third topic, we extend the proposed likelihood method for Equivalence inference, where data is often normal distributed. In this part, we demonstrate an additional advantage of the proposed method over current analysis methods such as likelihood ratio test and Bayesian analysis in Equivalence setting. The proposed likelihood method produces results that are same or comparable to current analysis methods in general case when model parameters are independent. However it yields better results in special cases when model parameters are dependent, for example the ratio of variances is directly proportional to the ratio of means. Our research results suggest the proposed likelihood method serves a better alternative than the current analysis methods to address BE/Equivalence inference...|$|R

Current treatments (embolization and stent graft [SG] explantation) are associated with lack of efficacy or high perioperative morbidity and mortality. This study evaluated an alternative technique that combines sacotomy, ligation of patent back-bleeding vessels, and SG preservation for T 2 L or <b>unspecified</b> endoleak repair. <b>Methods</b> This multicenter study in France included 28 patients (27 men; median age, 78  years). Twenty-one patients (75 %) had a bifurcated SG (including 3 fenestrated SGs) and seven (25 %) had an aortouniiliac SG (2 for ruptured aneurysm). Unsuccessful embolization had been performed in 10 patients (36 %). Four patients (14 %) presented sac enlargement with no endoleak visible on computed tomography. The origin of the endoleak remained unspecified in three patients 3 (11 %). The median diameter of the aneurysmal sac was 78  mm (vs 55  mm at the time of endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair) after a median follow-up of 24  months. Results A transperitoneal approach was used in 21 patients (75 %) and a retroperitoneal approach was used in seven (25 %). A guidewire was placed in the supraceliac aorta in 14 patients, and an occlusion balloon was temporarily inflated in six. Aortic cross-clamping was performed in five patients. T 2 Ls were identified in 26 patients, and associated with a distal type I endoleak in 1 patient, a type III endoleak in 3, and a type IV endoleak in 1. Two patients presented with endotension. All the endoleaks were treated successfully, with a mean operating time of 120  minutes and a mean blood loss of 450  mL. One SG was explanted 12  days after the procedure because of early infection. One patient died during SG explantation for an aortoduodenal fistula 26  months after the endoaneurysmorrhaphy. During a median follow-up of 24  months, the control computed tomography scan showed shrinkage of the aneurysmal sac with stable diameters in all patients. No missed T 2 Ls, no recurrence of T 2 L, and no SG migration or disjunction was observed. Conclusions Obliterating endoaneurysmorrhaphy with SG preservation can be considered as an alternative to SG removal in cases of persistent T 2 L responsible for aneurysmal sac enlargement after embolization failure. By avoiding extensive dissection for surgical aortic cross-clamping, minimizing hemodynamic changes, and reducing blood loss and operating time, this procedure can be performed even in patients initially considered unfit for surger...|$|R
