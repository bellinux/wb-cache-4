For the design and analysis of the study, the Sustainable Livelihoods Approach and a socio- technical perspective were used. The main drivers for SHSs were found to be improved economy, increased study opportunities for children and improved indoor environment from cutting out kerosene use. On the other hand, the main barrier for further spreading was the up-front cost of the SHS. Furthermore, though awareness of SHS is high, the lack of marketing of SHSs acts as another barrier.

40|$|Abstract — Most of the {{familiar}} protocols use single server for storing all the needed information to authenticate a <b>user.</b> <b>Maintenance</b> of security is of primary importance in any computing environment. Safe and effective authentication mechanism and evaluation methods of the entity are of utmost importance for the grid users to facilitate legitimate utilization of resources. It improves the legal user's credit rating and shields the system from illegal users. However {{the efficiency of the}} grid systems still requires improvement as exchanging certificates and verifying validity are compulsory. These systems are also infested by masquerade attacks. In this paper, we propose a resilient Authentication Architecture for Security, where authentication is based on strengthening parameters like variance and product. When a single server is compromised, a large number of user passwords, will be exposed. Our proposed approach uses an authentication protocol in order to improve the security in grid environment. The protocol utilizes fundamental concepts of triangle. Based on the parameters of the triangle the user authentication will be performed. In the proposed protocol, the password is interpreted and alienated into more than two units and these units are stored in two different servers. The privilege of accessing the requested resources is obtained by the user only when the combined authentication scheme from both the servers authenticates the user. The main advantage of utilizing the authentication protocol in computing is that an adversary user cannot attain the access privilege by compromising a single consolidated server {{because of the fact that}} split password is stored in two different servers. For flexibility and reusability this authentication mechanism is hosted as service in grid environment. Keywords-Two – Server Authentication, grid security, Attacks. I...|$|E

MAINBOT aims at using already available robotic solutions to deploy innovative systems {{in order to}} fulfill project industrial objectives: to provide a means to help measuring several physical parameters in multiple points by autonomous robots, able to navigate and climb structures, handling sensors or special non destructive testing equipment. MAINBOT will validate the proposed solutions in two solar plants (cylindrical-parabolic collectors and central tower), that are very demanding from mobile manipulation point of view mainly due to the extension (e. g. a thermal solar plant of 50 Mw, seven hours of storage, with 400 hectares, 400. 000 mirrors, 180 km of absorber tubes, 140 m tower height), the variability of conditions (outdoor, day-night), safet y requirements, etc. The objective is to increase the efficiency of the installation by improving the inspection procedures and technologies. Robot capabilities are developed at different levels: (1) Simulation: realistic testing environments are created in order to validate the algorithms developed for the project using available robot, sensors and application environments.

40|$|This {{project and}} {{research}} {{has resulted in}} the development of a World Wide Web (WWW) based testing system. WEBassess can be accessed and used from any point in the world that has a connection to the WWW. The WEBassess system allows for the creation and completion of tests through the WWW interface. Scoring and feedback of submitted tests is completely automated, allowing students to see their test result immediately, including visual indicators for correct and incorrect answers. These test results may then be viewed by academic staff, showing complete test details, such as unit code, test title, score, percentage, date and time of test submission plus correct and incorrect answers. Through the logging of this information into the WEBassess database, profiles can be derived, indicating which students are having the most difficulty with certain questions. This information is stated against a student 2 ̆ 7 s identification number. The entire WEBassess system can be administered through a consistent WWW interface, including the addition, deletion and maintenance of pools of questions. <b>User</b> <b>maintenance</b> is also included in this administration module, allowing for the addition, deleting and alteration of Admin, Staff and Student level users. Security is implemented in the form of passwords linked to specific user identification details. A WEBassess user is presented with only the screens which their level of access allows, be it Administration (Admin), Staff or Student. The WEBassess system has been developed using a variety of software and hardware tools, the most crucial of these being an application called Lasso (Blueworld Inc, 1997) and the Filemaker Pro 3 (Claris Corporation, 1997) relational database. The Lasso application communicates with the Filemaker Pro database via a WWW server. The WEBassess system has been designed as a tool for student knowledge testing and feedback, rather than as a traditional assessment and scoring device. Features found in the WEBassess system have been created to comply with specific requirements for Edith Cowan University staff and students, whilst other features have been derived from similar testing systems currently in use on the WWW. The WEBassess system is presently at the level of preliminary user testing, from which initial changes to the system have already taken place. Several future developments for the system are envisaged, to be implemented after a prolonged period of end-user testing on the finalised program...|$|E
