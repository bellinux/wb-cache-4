30|$|The closet {{works to}} ours are in [16, 17] where many {{vehicles}} collect their congestion indices [16] or travelling times [17] on road segments and {{return them to}} a single-source vehicle to determine the path with shortest travelling time or least traffic congestion to a destination. Essentially, a source vehicle specifies routes of interest and broadcasts a query message. Each node in the routes of interest rebroadcasts the query at most once and keeps the reverse path entry to its immediate query sender. Each node then unicasts its congestion index or traveling time over the current road segment back to the source vehicle. So, the source vehicle can estimate the average congestion index or average travelling time of individual road segments and determine the best path. In [16], a node also caches the congestion index in a received unicast response message to prevent unnecessary rebroadcasts. Since all nodes must return the information directly to the source, the amount of overheads and collisions can become significant especially <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> query sessions or user traffic.|$|R

40|$|The neo-empiricist {{theories}} of concepts, supported by Prinz (2002), Barsalou (2008) {{and by the}} huge community of cognitive psychology, forecast that conceptual system is formed starting from segmentation, flexible and context-sensitive, of portions of perceptions and actions, concerning the objects with the concepts relating to. Subsequently these mobile constructs (coinciding with neutral pattern activation), extracted from interaction with external objects, are reactivated and reused when contextual conditions stimulate it. These theories explain well the formation of conceptual classes, concerning actions in concrete objects and situations, while they seem to fail if we speak about their universality and normativity: they don’t explain abstract concepts, like justice or democracy, nor what class of normative relations exists between concepts themselves and their carrier.
