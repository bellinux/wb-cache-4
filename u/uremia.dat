5|$|Given {{the events}} {{happening}} in Cuba at the time, Betances thought that his diplomatic work {{was more important}} than ever. However, his failing health (he had <b>uremia,</b> and since his lungs could not exchange oxygen properly this put extra burden to his heart and kidneys) prevented Betances from performing further diplomatic work from France on behalf of Puerto Rico or Cuba. His illness, which lasted more than a year, prevented him from performing medical work, and forced the Party to approve a stipend for Betances during his long illness, until his death.|$|E
5|$|However, Ruiz died in Valparaíso, Chile {{soon after}} his arrival in the country. He {{reportedly}} had <b>uremia</b> and a urethral obstruction, both of which deteriorated into Fournier gangrene, which killed him soon after. Later speculation that Ruiz had been poisoned or killed has been countered by three facts: that Ruiz's brother, Mariano Ruiz Quiñones (who was the coordinator of the revolution in Curaçao), died of the same condition soon after (suggesting a genetic predisposition to it), that Betances had used a catheter on Ruiz before he left Saint Thomas to bring him some relief from his condition, and that Betances published a medical article in France twenty years later, in 1887, that discussed the condition, out {{of what he had}} described as many years of second-guessing what could have been done to save Ruiz's life.|$|E
5|$|Prepatellar {{bursitis}} {{is caused}} by either a single instance of acute trauma to the knee, or repeated minor trauma to the knee. The trauma can cause extravasation of nearby fluids into the bursa, which stimulates an inflammatory response. This response occurs in two phases: The vascular phase, in which the {{blood flow to the}} surrounding area increases, and the cellular phase, in which leukocytes migrate from the blood to the affected area. Other possible causes include gout, sarcoidosis, CREST syndrome, diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, <b>uremia,</b> and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Some cases are idiopathic, though these may be caused by trauma that the patient does not remember.|$|E
5|$|Many more {{hotels and}} {{restaurants}} were constructed in the remaining years of Boeckling's tenure, including Hotel Cedars, White House Hotel, Crystal Rock Castle, and Crystal Gardens Ballroom. The Cyclone, a rickety and rough coaster, was built in 1926. Cedar Point continued to update its ride attractions, replacing the Racer, the Circle Swing, and many other rides {{to make way for}} a Shoot-the-Chutes water ride, a Tilt-A-Whirl, and fun houses such as Noah's Ark and Bluebeard's Palace. Boeckling's health began to deteriorate in the late 1920s. In 1931, Boeckling became confined to a wheelchair, but he continued to oversee park operations, and was pushed around Cedar Point by an employee or relative. His condition worsened, however, and he eventually had to remain indoors. Boeckling died on July 24, 1931 from <b>uremia.</b> His portrait in the lobby of Breakers Hotel was draped in black. Flags in the resort and on the G.A. Boeckling steamboat were lowered to half mast.|$|E
5|$|Other {{laboratory}} abnormalities {{may suggest}} poisoning, especially {{the presence of}} a metabolic acidosis, particularly if it is characterized by a large anion gap. Large anion gap acidosis is usually present during the initial stage of poisoning. However, acidosis has a large number of differential diagnosis, including poisoning from methanol, salicylates, iron, isoniazid, paracetamol, theophylline, or from conditions such as <b>uremia</b> or diabetic and alcoholic ketoacidosis. The diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning should be considered in any patient with a severe acidosis. Urine microscopy can reveal needle or envelope-shaped calcium oxalate crystals in the urine which can suggest poisoning; although these crystals may not be present until the late stages of poisoning. Finally, many commercial radiator antifreeze products have fluorescein added to enable radiator leaks to be detected using a Wood's lamp. Following ingestion of antifreeze products containing ethylene glycol and fluorescein, a Wood's lamp may reveal fluorescence of a patient’s mouth area, clothing, vomitus, or urine which can help to diagnose poisoning.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{advancement}} of modern medicine, acute kidney injury {{was referred to as}} uremic poisoning while <b>uremia</b> was contamination of the blood with urine. Starting around 1847, <b>uremia</b> came to be used for reduced urine output, a condition now called oliguria, which was thought to be caused by the urine's mixing with the blood instead of being voided through the urethra.|$|E
25|$|Renal disease. Patients {{who have}} <b>uremia</b> often have poor or absent appetite, {{vomiting}} and nausea. This can cause weight loss.|$|E
25|$|Before modern treatments, the 2-year {{mortality}} {{was over}} 90% and average survival five months. Death usually resulted from <b>uremia</b> or respiratory failure.|$|E
25|$|Severity and {{prognosis}} {{of pneumonia}} {{can be estimated}} from CURB65, where C=Confusion, U= <b>Uremia</b> (>7), R=Respiratory rate >30, B= BP<90, 65= Age>65.|$|E
25|$|Possible {{cognitive}} executive functioning {{issues associated}} with <b>uremia</b> condition of end state kidney disease. This may affect memory, ability to plan effectively, and keeping to schedules.|$|E
25|$|Urea accumulates, {{leading to}} {{azotemia}} and ultimately <b>uremia</b> (symptoms ranging from lethargy to pericarditis and encephalopathy). Due to its high systemic circulation, urea is excreted in eccrine sweat at high concentrations and crystallizes on skin as the sweat evaporates ("uremic frost").|$|E
25|$|Cimetidine is {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of tubular creatinine secretion. Creatinine is a metabolic byproduct of creatine breakdown. Accumulation of creatinine is associated with <b>uremia,</b> but the symptoms of creatinine accumulation are unknown, as they are hard to separate from other nitrogenous waste buildups.|$|E
25|$|Because he {{was using}} morphine, many older sources {{describe}} London's death as a suicide, and some still do. This conjecture {{appears to be a}} rumor, or speculation based on incidents in his fiction writings. His death certificate gives the cause as <b>uremia,</b> following acute renal colic.|$|E
25|$|Scott {{collapsed}} and fell {{again in his}} law office on March 14, 1958, and {{was rushed to the}} hospital. He died on March 24, with his son George at his side. The cause of death was <b>uremia.</b> His wife and six of his children survived him.|$|E
25|$|In a textbook, Carl Braun, Semmelweis's {{successor}} {{as assistant}} {{in the first}} clinic, identified 30 causes of childbed fever; only the 28th of these was cadaverous infection. Other causes included conception and pregnancy, <b>uremia,</b> pressure exerted on adjacent organs by the shrinking uterus, emotional traumata, mistakes in diet, chilling, and atmospheric epidemic influences.|$|E
25|$|AKI {{may lead}} to a number of complications, {{including}} metabolic acidosis, high potassium levels, <b>uremia,</b> changes in body fluid balance, and effects on other organ systems, including death. People who have experienced AKI may have an increased risk of chronic kidney disease in the future. Management includes treatment of the underlying cause and supportive care, such as renal replacement therapy.|$|E
25|$|Suffering {{from high}} blood pressure, Wynter relinquished his post of LGA on 19 September 1944. The {{next day he}} {{was placed on the}} Supernumerary List pending retirement. He was {{admitted}} to the 115th General Hospital in Heidelberg, Victoria where he died on 7 February 1945. The medical officer listed the cause of death as <b>uremia</b> and hypertension. He was buried with military honours in Springvale cemetery.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} noted that the {{sorbitol}} added to sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS, used {{in the treatment of}} hyperkalemia) can cause complications in the GI tract, including bleeding, perforated colonic ulcers, ischemic colitis and colonic necrosis, particularly in patients with <b>uremia.</b> Risk factors for sorbitol-induced damage include immunosuppression, hypovolemia, postoperative setting, hypotension after hemodialysis, and peripheral vascular disease. SPS-sorbitol should therefore be used carefully in the management of hyperkalemia.|$|E
25|$|Gompers' health {{went into}} serious decline {{starting}} in February 1923, when a serious bout of influenza {{sent him to}} the hospital, sidelining him from work for six weeks. No sooner had he recovered from the flu than he was stricken by a case of bronchitis that laid him low again. By June 1924 Gompers, who suffered from diabetes, could no longer walk without assistance, and he was hospitalized again, this time suffering from congestive heart failure and <b>uremia.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1868, Pasteur {{suffered}} a stroke that paralysed {{the left side of}} his body, but he recovered. A stroke or <b>uremia</b> in 1894 severely impaired his health. Failing to fully recover, he died on September 28, 1895, near Paris. He was given a state funeral and was buried in the Cathedral of Notre Dame, but his remains were reinterred in the Pasteur Institute in Paris, in a vault covered in depictions of his accomplishments in Byzantine mosaics.|$|E
25|$|Art Tatum died on November 5, 1956, at Queen of Angels Medical Center in Los Angeles, from {{complications}} of <b>uremia</b> (as {{a result of}} kidney failure). He was originally interred at Angelus Rosedale Cemetery in Los Angeles, but was moved by his wife, Geraldine Tatum, to the Great Mausoleum of Glendale's Forest Lawn Cemetery in 1991, so she could ultimately be buried next to him, although his headstone was left at Rosedale to commemorate where he was first laid to rest.|$|E
25|$|The {{physical}} examination is {{the examination of}} the patient for medical signs of disease, which are objective and observable, in contrast to symptoms which are volunteered by the patient and not necessarily objectively observable. The healthcare provider uses the senses of sight, hearing, touch, and sometimes smell (e.g., in infection, <b>uremia,</b> diabetic ketoacidosis). Four actions are the basis of {{physical examination}}: inspection, palpation (feel), percussion (tap to determine resonance characteristics), and auscultation (listen), generally in that order although auscultation occurs prior to percussion and palpation for abdominal assessments.|$|E
25|$|Pericardial effusion* is a {{collection}} of fluid in the pericardium. It is usually serosanguinous (bloody fluid). Serosanguinous accumulation can be caused by cancer, usually hemangiosarcoma or a heart base tumor, idiopathic pericarditis. Rare causes include trauma, clotting disorders, and left atrial rupture. Serous accumulation is rare and caused by heart failure, peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic hernias, <b>uremia,</b> pericardial cysts, or hypoalbuminemia. Rarely pericardial effusion can be caused by infection and consist of pus. An echocardiogram should be done prior to draining the fluid, if possible, to identify the cause (e.g., tumor). Drainage of the fluid (pericardiocentesis) relieves the clinical signs and, in the case of idiopathic pericarditis, can be curative.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Leland Chapman—a {{colleague}} of Fishbaugh—was {{called in to}} give a second opinion; he recognized {{that she was not}} suffering from an inflamed gallbladder, but was in the end stages of kidney failure. On June 6, Harlow said that she could not see Powell properly and could not tell how many fingers he was holding up. That evening, Harlow was taken to Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles, where she slipped into a coma. The next day at 11:37am, Harlow died in the hospital at the age of 26. In the doctor's press releases, {{the cause of death was}} given as cerebral edema, a complication of kidney failure. Hospital records mention <b>uremia.</b>|$|E
25|$|She {{returned}} to Paris in 1916 and made two short films on patriotic themes, {{one based on}} the story of Joan of Arc, the other called Mothers of France. Then she embarked on her final American farewell tour. Despite the threat of German submarines, she crossed the Atlantic and toured the United States, performing in major cities including New York and San Francisco. Bernhardt was diagnosed with <b>uremia,</b> and had to have an emergency kidney operation. She recuperated in Long Beach, California, for several months, writing short stories and novellas for publication in French magazines. In 1918, she {{returned to}} New York and boarded a ship to France, landing in Bordeaux on 11 November 1918, the day that the armistice was signed ending the First World War.|$|E
25|$|Hemolytic-uremic {{syndrome}} (or haemolytic-uraemic syndrome), abbreviated HUS, is {{a disease}} characterized by a triad of hemolytic anemia (anemia caused by destruction of red blood cells), acute kidney failure (<b>uremia),</b> and a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia). It predominantly, but not exclusively, affects children. Most cases are preceded by an episode of infectious, sometimes bloody, diarrhea acquired as a foodborne illness or from a contaminated water supply caused by , other non-O157:H7 E. coli serotypes, Shigella, and Campylobacter. A variety of viruses have also been implicated as a causative agent. It is now {{the most common cause}} of acquired acute renal failure in childhood. It is a medical emergency and carries a 5–10% mortality rate; of the remainder, the majority recover without major consequences, approximately 30% suffer residual renal injury. The primary target appears to be the vascular endothelial cell. This may explain the pathogenesis of HUS, in which a characteristic renal lesion is capillary microangiopathy.|$|E
25|$|Action {{myoclonus}} {{is characterized}} by muscular jerking triggered or intensified by voluntary movement or even the intention to move. It may be made worse by attempts at precise, coordinated movements. Action myoclonus is the most disabling form of myoclonus and can affect the arms, legs, face, and even the voice. It {{is often associated with}} tonic-clonic seizures and diffuse neuronal disease such as post-hypoxic encephalopathy, <b>uremia,</b> and the various forms of PME, although, in the case of focal cerebral damage, the disease may be restricted to one limb. This type of myoclonus often is caused by brain damage that results from a lack of oxygen and blood flow to the brain when breathing or heartbeat is temporarily stopped. Over-excitement of the sensorimotor cortex (cortical reflex myoclonus) or reticular formation (reticular reflex myoclonus) is also a cause of action myoclonus. Serotonin and GABA neurotransmitters are thought to cause this lack of inhibition, which is a possible explanation as to why improvements are made with the administration of serotonin precursors. Systems involved include the cerebellodentatorubral, pyramidal, extrapyramidal, optic, auditory, posterior columns and gracile and cuneate nuclei, spinocerebellar tracts, motor neurons of cranial nerves and anterior horns, and muscle fibers.|$|E
2500|$|In early January 1725, Peter {{was struck}} {{once again with}} <b>uremia.</b> Legend has it that before lapsing into {{unconsciousness}} Peter asked for a paper and pen and scrawled an unfinished note that read: [...] "Leave all to..." [...] and then, exhausted by the effort, asked for his daughter Anna to be summoned.|$|E
2500|$|The biographer Stasz writes, [...] "Following London's death, for {{a number}} of reasons, a biographical myth {{developed}} in which he has been portrayed as an alcoholic womanizer who committed suicide. Recent scholarship based upon firsthand documents challenges this caricature." [...] Most biographers, including Russ Kingman, now agree he died of <b>uremia</b> aggravated by an accidental morphine overdose.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the popular}} {{conception}} of Dmitri as a frail {{man who had}} suffered all his life from chronic tuberculosis, he was {{for most of his}} life a very active sportsman, excelling at polo, horse racing, tennis, and bobsledding. His doctors in London and Davos estimated that he first contracted tuberculosis around 1929, which ran a chronic course, but he had not had it previously. He entered Sanatorium [...] "Schatzalp" [...] on 2 September 1939, the day after the German invasion of Poland, and remarked in a letter to his sister that he had never before spent a single night in any kind of hospital or medical institution. His cause of death remains unknown since there is no cause listed on his death certificate, and all of Schatzalp's medical records were destroyed after the conversion of the sanatorium into a hotel in the 1950s. His son believed he had died of tuberculosis, and his cousin Prince Michael Feodorovich of Russia cited <b>uremia,</b> and his [...] New York Times obituary cited <b>uremia</b> as well. Rumours of murder sprang up locally but have never been substantiated, and there was no police investigation.|$|E
2500|$|A widower since December 1929, Bianu {{died in his}} Bucharest home on February 13, 1935, {{after an}} episode of <b>uremia.</b> His body was laid in state at the Academy, and the Faculty of Letters marked the {{occasion}} by suspending courses for the day. He was buried alongside Alexandrina Bianu in Plot 54 of Bellu cemetery. In his obituary piece, the Cultural League's Iorga referred to Bianu as [...] "the Academy's titular god". Bianu's personal book collections, comprising some 1,400 volumes, was bequeathed to the Academy Library.|$|E
2500|$|The PFA-100 (Platelet Function Assay-100) is {{a system}} for {{analysing}} platelet function in which citrated whole blood is aspirated through [...] a disposable cartridge containing an aperture within a membrane coated with either collagen and epinephrine or collagen and ADP. These agonists induce platelet adhesion, activation and aggregation leading to rapid occlusion of the aperture and cessation of blood flow termed the closure time (CT). An elevated CT with EPI and collagen can indicate intrinsic defects such as von Willebrand disease, <b>uremia,</b> or circulating platelet inhibitors. The follow up test involving collagen and ADP is used to indicate if the abnormal CT with collagen and EPI {{was caused by the}} effects of acetyl sulfosalicylic acid (aspirin) or medications containing inhibitors.|$|E
2500|$|In 1922, {{she began}} rehearsing a new play by Sacha Guitry, called Un Sujet de Roman. On {{the night of}} the dress rehearsal, she collapsed, going into a coma for an hour, then awakened with the words, [...] "when do I go on?" [...] She recuperated for several months, with her {{condition}} improving; she began preparing for a new role as Cleopatra in Rodogune by Corneille, and agreed to make a new film by Sasha Guitry called La Voyante, for a payment of 10,000 francs a day. She was too weak to travel, so a room in her house on Boulevard Pereire was set up as a film studio, with scenery, lights, and cameras. However, on 21 March 1923, she collapsed again, and never recovered. She died from <b>uremia</b> on the evening of 26 March 1923. Newspaper reports stated she died [...] "peacefully, without suffering, in the arms of her son". The following day, 30,000 people attended her funeral to pay their respects, and an enormous crowd followed her casket from the Church of Saint-Francoise-de-Sales to Pere Lachaise Cemetery, pausing for a minute of silence outside her theater. The inscription on her tombstone is the name [...] "Bernhardt".|$|E
2500|$|Some ANAs {{appear in}} {{several types of}} disease, {{resulting}} in lower specificity of the test. For example, IgM-rheumatoid factor (IgM-RF) {{have been shown to}} cross-react with ANA giving falsely positive immunofluorescence. Positive ANA as well as anti-DNA antibodies have been reported in patients with autoimmune thyroid disease. ANA can have a positive test result in up to 45% of people with autoimmune thyroid conditions or rheumatoid arthritis and up to 15% of people with HIV or hepatitis C. As per Lupus Foundation of America, [...] "about 5% of the general population will have a positive ANA. However, at least 95% {{of the people who have}} a positive ANA do not have lupus! A positive ANA test can sometimes run in families, even if family members have no evidence of lupus." [...] On the other hand, they say, although 95% of the patients who actually have lupus test positive for ANA, [...] "Only a small percentage have a negative ANA, and many of those have other antibodies (such as anti-phospholipid antibodies, anti-Ro, anti-SSA) or their ANA converted from positive to negative from steroids, cytotoxic medications, or <b>uremia</b> (kidney failure)." ...|$|E
50|$|Classical {{signs of}} <b>uremia</b> are: {{progressive}} weakness and easy fatigue, {{loss of appetite}} due to nausea and vomiting, muscle atrophy, tremors, abnormal mental function, frequent shallow respiration and metabolic acidosis. Without intervention via dialysis or kidney transplant, <b>uremia</b> due to renal failure will progress and cause stupor, coma and death. Because <b>uremia</b> is mostly a consequence of kidney failure, its {{signs and symptoms of}}ten occur concomitantly with other signs and symptoms of kidney failure. Below is a table showing more of the principal signs and symptoms of <b>uremia.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{detailed}} and accurate history and physical will help determine if <b>uremia</b> is acute or chronic. In {{the cases of}} acute <b>uremia,</b> causes may be identified and eliminated, leading to higher chance for recovery of normal renal function, if treated correctly.|$|E
