5000|$|By {{reducing}} the amount of heat from the exhaust being lost into the <b>underbonnet</b> area. This reduces the <b>underbonnet</b> temperature and consequently lowers the intake manifold temperature, increasing power. This also has positive side effect of preventing heat-sensitive components from being damaged. Furthermore, keeping the heat in the exhaust gases speeds these up, therefore reducing back pressure as well.|$|E
5000|$|Lowering the <b>underbonnet</b> temperature, {{which has}} the effect of {{lowering}} the engine intake temperature, therefore increasing the power. This is often done by installing a type of thermal insulation (normally a heatshield, thermal barrier coating or other type of exhaust heat management) on or around the exhaust manifold. This ensures that more heat is diverted out and away from the <b>underbonnet</b> area.|$|E
50|$|External changes included: new grilles in {{the front}} bumper to improve the air intake for engine {{compartment}} cooling; a redesigned bonnet (hood) with new lateral air slats to further assist <b>underbonnet</b> ventilation; an adjustable roof spoiler above the tailgate; new five-bolt wheels with the same design of the rally cars; and a new single exhaust pipe.|$|E
50|$|In 1985, Rover Group {{made the}} {{decision}} to develop a new electronic engine management system in-house, and from its inception, the system was intended to be flexible enough for use with future engine designs. It was also intended to improve quality and reliability, and to consume less power and occupy less <b>underbonnet</b> space than previous engine management systems. The system first became available in 1989, when it was fitted to the Austin Montego 2.0L. Over the next seven years, the system appeared on cars across Rover's model lineup, including the Mk VI and Mk VII Mini and the MG F / MG TF. It was also paired with Rover engines used by other marques, such as the Series 1 Lotus Elise and several Caterham models using the Rover K-series engine.|$|E
5000|$|Beginning {{with the}} first E36 M3s delivered, BMW racers began {{pressuring}} BMW for a homologation version with which to compete against Porsche 911s in sports-car racing. A homologation version is a car with special modifications from the factory that are allowed in racing as [...] "production" [...] cars, if enough cars are made and sold.In 1995, BMW relented and offered the M3 Lightweight. The major changes to the car were to lower the weight for racing. The cars came without a radio (although the speakers were installed and the car pre-wired for the radio), air conditioning, leather seats, tool kit, or a sun roof. The doors have aluminum skins. There is no <b>underbonnet</b> insulation blanket and the trunk only has carpet on the floor. The under body insulation is thinner and there is special carpeting to lower weight. Overall the changes added up to 200 lb less than a standard M3.|$|E
