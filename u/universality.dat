5|$|The biggest {{challenge}} {{to the notion of}} the <b>universality</b> of attachment theory came from studies conducted in Japan where the concept of amae plays a prominent role in describing family relationships. Arguments revolved around the appropriateness of the use of the Strange Situation procedure where amae is practiced. Ultimately research tended to confirm the <b>universality</b> hypothesis of attachment theory. Most recently a 2007 study conducted in Sapporo in Japan found attachment distributions consistent with global norms using the six-year Main and Cassidy scoring system for attachment classification.|$|E

40|$|All {{dark matter}} {{structures}} appear {{to follow a}} set of <b>universalities,</b> such as phase-space density or velocity anisotropy profiles, however, the origin of these <b>universalities</b> remains a mystery. Any equilibrated dark matter structure can be fully described by two functions, namely the radial and the tangential velocity distribution functions (VDF), and when we will understand these two then we will understand all the observed <b>universalities.</b> Here we demonstrate that if we know the radial VDF, then we can derive and understand the tangential VDF. This is based on simple dynamical arguments about properties of collisionless systems. We use a range of controlled numerical simulations to demonstrate the accuracy of this result. We therefore boil {{the question of the}} dark matter structural properties down to understanding the radial VDF. Comment: 8 pages, 6 figures, to appear in Ap...|$|R

40|$|Kernel {{methods have}} been widely applied to machine {{learning}} and other questions of approximating an unknown function from its finite sample data. To ensure arbitrary accuracy of such approximation, various denseness conditions are imposed on the selected kernel. This note contributes {{to the study of}} universal, characteristic, and $C_ 0 $-universal kernels. We first give simple and direct description of the difference and relation among these three kinds of <b>universalities</b> of kernels. We then focus on translation-invariant and weighted polynomial kernels. A simple and shorter proof of the known characterization of characteristic translation-invariant kernels will be presented. The main purpose of the note is to give a delicate discussion on the <b>universalities</b> of weighted polynomial kernels...|$|R

5|$|Special {{relativity}} {{is defined}} {{in the absence of}} gravity, so for practical applications, it is a suitable model whenever gravity can be neglected. Bringing gravity into play, and assuming the <b>universality</b> of free fall, an analogous reasoning as in the previous section applies: there are no global inertial frames. Instead there are approximate inertial frames moving alongside freely falling particles. Translated into the language of spacetime: the straight time-like lines that define a gravity-free inertial frame are deformed to lines that are curved relative to each other, suggesting that the inclusion of gravity necessitates a change in spacetime geometry.|$|E
40|$|Comments on the {{original}} article by Peter Rober & Lucia De Haene (see record 2014 - 13242 - 002). Rober and De Haene note the limits, even regressive effects, of using the framework of cultural competence {{and the importance of}} recognising <b>universalities</b> in human nature. In their article, Rober and De Haene propose a view of intercultural family therapy in which the unresolvable dialectical tension between differences and <b>universalities</b> is central. Rober and De Haene remind us of the complexity of the issues. But, note the current author, with complexity also comes a requirement to be clear about how we talk about it. Rober and De Haene use the terms ‘shared humanity’, ‘human being’, ‘universality’ and ‘the universal’. The present author thinks that this calls for clarification...|$|R

5|$|When the French Government first {{investigated}} {{the idea of}} overhauling their system of measurement, the concept of <b>universality</b> was put into practice in 1789: Maurice de Talleyrand, acting on Condorcet's advice, invited John Riggs Miller, a British parliamentarian and Thomas Jefferson, the American Secretary of State to George Washington, {{to work with the}} French in producing an international standard by promoting legislation in their respective legislative bodies.

5|$|During the 2009 {{parliamentary}} {{debate on the}} right to vote's status, Thio Li-ann proposed that, to avoid doubt, the right should be specifically set out in the Constitution.

As it is an ordinary statute, it can be altered with a simple parliamentary majority by future governments seeking to amend or restrict voting rights. Thio said that expressing the right to vote clearly in the Constitution would allow aspects of that right such as voter secrecy and the <b>universality</b> and equality of votes to be protected from unjust manipulation.|$|E

40|$|The {{domain of}} inquiry was generic and {{professional}} cultural care meanings {{and practices of}} Finnish women in birth. The purpose was to discover culture care diversities and <b>universalities</b> of generic and professional care of Finnish women in birth. Discovery of the epistemic and ontological dimensions of women 2 ̆ 7 s health and well being related to providing culture care was held {{to contribute to the}} body of transcultural nursing knowledge. Previous transcultural nursing studies of birthing in different cultures with a care focus was held as essential to understand health care practices and well being. The need exists for further indepth studies of care meanings and practices for women of diverse cultures and will significantly encourage holistic and humanistic care. Leininger 2 ̆ 7 s theory of Culture Care with the ethnonursing and audiovisual research methods, was used to study the generic and professional care meanings and practices. Several enablers were used to obtain indepth knowledge about Finnish birthing practices from the holistic emic and etic perspectives. The data were obtained by using observation and reflection in the active participation in the birth experiences of ten Finnish women identified as key informants. In the analysis of data, Leininger 2 ̆ 7 s Phases of Ethnonursing Analysis for Qualitative Data was used for a systematic and indepth ethnonursing investigation. Major themes identified in the generic care practices were found to be comfort care and physical care; themes identified in the professional care practices were found to be ritualized care and anticipatory care. Although many <b>universalities</b> were found to exist in the generic and professional care meanings and practices, the diversity that was identified existed in the satisfaction expressed with the birth experience. This indepth knowledge of the generic and professional care meanings and practices, the cultural care dimensions of the Finnish culture, and the cultural diversities and <b>universalities</b> that exist in the findings will assist nurses in planning and providing culturally congruent care-important implications as our world becomes more culturally diverse...|$|R
