The entire road from Main Street in Church Hill to Ingleside was built in 1915 with a width of [...] The portion from Church Hill to Roberts Station was constructed as a macadam road, and the section from Roberts Station through Ingleside was paved with concrete. MD 19 was among the highways signed when the commission first signed highways numerically in 1927, as was MD 313, which met MD 19 in the center of Ingleside. The highway was widened along its entire length between 1948 and 1950. MD 313 was reconstructed and relocated to the east of Ingleside starting in 1949, and when its bypass was completed in 1951, MD 19 was extended to its current eastern terminus. The highway was resurfaced with bituminous concrete over its entire length later that year. US 213 (now MD 213) through Church Hill was resurfaced with bituminous concrete in 1968. MD 19 was then extended over US 213 to its current western terminus after US 213's bypass of Church Hill was completed in 1970. Main Street in Church Hill was given an <b>urban</b> <b>reconstruction</b> starting in 2003.|$|E

Therefore the needs of covering ad-hoc demand and performing a close-range <b>urban</b> terrain <b>reconstruction</b> with miniaturized and relatively inexpensive sensor platforms are constantly growing. Using (miniaturized) unmanned aerial vehicles, (M) UAVs, {{represents one of the}} most attractive alternatives to conventional large-scale aerial imagery. We cover in this paper a four-step procedure of obtaining georeferenced 3 D urban models from video sequences. The four steps of the procedure - orientation, dense <b>reconstruction,</b> <b>urban</b> terrain modeling and geo-referencing - are robust, straight-forward, and nearly fully-automatic. The two last steps - namely, urban terrain modeling from almost-nadir videos and co-registration of models - represent the main contribution of this work and will therefore be covered with more detail. The essential substeps of the third step include digital terrain model (DTM) extraction, segregation of buildings from vegetation, as well as instantiation of building and tree models. The last step is subdivided into quasiintrasensorial registration of Euclidean reconstructions and intersensorial registration with a geo-referenced orthophoto. Finally, we present reconstruction results from a real data-set and outline ideas for future work...|$|R

40|$|This article {{critically}} {{discusses the}} recent {{growing interest in}} and regained 'respectability' of the Situationist International and related urban cultural, architectural and political movements. It engages particularly with the present reinvention of the Situationist Movement and argues that the rediscovery of the 'Situationist City' celebrates an intellectualized, aestheticized and de-politicized version that is particularly oblivious to the political and revolutionary theories and programmatic emancipatory urban agenda that underpinned the Situationist movement. We shall argue that this aestheticized reappropriation of selected parts of the Situationist legacy reinforces exactly what the Situationists actively criticized and tried to undermine. At the same time, intellectual and cultural attention is diverted away from the active <b>urban</b> <b>reconstructions</b> that try to confront the totalizing presence of the spectacle and breathe the spirit that Guy Debord and his friends pioneered in the 1950 s and 1960 s. We shall attempt to connect this rediscovery of the 'Situationist City' and the urban imaginations of the time to the theoretical and political insights, particularly those of Guy Debord, that developed in tandem with their concern with {{the production of a}} new way of living, one that revolved squarely around recapturing the urban.

40|$|Highway {{infrastructures}} in North America have surpassed {{their service}} life, and the transportation developments are shifting from {{construction of new}} highways to reconstruction of existing facilities. Elevated <b>urban</b> highway <b>reconstruction</b> projects involve complex geometry and limited space available which lead to spatio-temporal conflicts. Additionally, maintaining acceptable flow of traffic without compromising safety in highway construction zones is another major issue for planners. Overall, the phasing of construction work in such projects is complicated due to the structural complexity, large number of involved contractors, independent resource utilization planning by each contractor, and the vast number of activities that will be taking {{place at the same}} time. This research proposes a new methodology by integrating 4 D modeling and simulation in the planning and scheduling phases of elevated <b>urban</b> highway <b>reconstruction</b> projects to detect spatio-temporal conflicts. A sequence assessment approach using a deterministic 4 D model is presented to define the order in which the segments should be constructed or demolished. The result of this step is a sequence which will be used as the process chain for simulation techniques. Then, a probabilistic 4 D model is introduced by linking the 3 D model of the project with generated probabilistic schedules from Monte-Carlo and Discrete Event simulations. The proposed approach is capable of identifying scenarios with the highest potential of conflict and calculating the probability associated with each scenario. The benefits of the proposed approach are highlighted, and the feasibility of the proposed methods is explored through three case studies. ...|$|R
