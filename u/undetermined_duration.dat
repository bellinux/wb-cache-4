40|$|An {{important}} element that may support the work control without legal contracts {{refers to the}} flexicurity – a modern concept that develops within many countries members of E. U. and where is combined as balance solution on the work market, the flexibility under different aspects with security and/or safety of the work place 1. (There are cases when the employee avoids {{the conclusion of a}} work contract with normal duration of 8 continuum hours per day). For this reason there will be considered the examination of the flexibility degree stipulated in the standard contracts (contract with <b>undetermined</b> <b>duration</b> and with full norm) regarding the notices terms, costs and the procedures regarding the individual or collective dismissals, inclusively even the definition „ abusive dismissals”, this one being from historic point of view the key- element of the security of the work place for the employees. labour market, flexisecurity, employment...|$|E
40|$|In {{the work}} of the {{contemporary}} Barcelonan writer, Enrique Vila-Matas, space and time are brought together through significant metaphors, as one of its narrative characteristics is the space-time connection and the unusual of those metaphors. One of the relevant metaphors is that of the island and it is related to the voyage and especially with Ulysses’s main figure. Also it is connected with that of the vanished continent, Atlantis. Another metaphor is that of the chamber around which the character travels without having to move and the examples could go on. These metaphors are related with the correspondent timelines, whether it’s the <b>undetermined</b> <b>duration,</b> or the achrony, or the multichrony. This type of metaphors is very important in Vila-Matas’s novels, as they constitute the knots of his literary Network and we may refer to a constructive strategy in his novels, a typical strategy of Transmodernism, {{that is one of the}} poetics of the contemporary global society...|$|E
40|$|Summary The {{relationship}} between {{the size of the}} primary tumour upon initial treatment and the incidence of distant metastasis {{during the course of the}} disease was investigated using data from 2648 breast cancers treated at the Institut Gustave Roussy between 1954 and 1972. This analysis suggests the existence for each tumour of a critical volume (threshold) at which the first remote metastasis is initiated. The correlation between the size of the primary tumour and the probability of metastatic dissemination was assessed as well as the influence on this correlation of two prognostic indicators: histological grade and number of involved lymph nodes. It was found that the threshold volume is strongly correlated with the number of involved lymph nodes and the histological grading. Until 25 years ago, it was believed that growth of human tumours was both unpredictable and rapid. Consequently it was assumed intuitively that the duration of their apparent life was either short or consisted of a period of dormancy, of <b>undetermined</b> <b>duration,</b> followed by rapid growth. Collins et al., (1956) were probably the first to stud...|$|E
40|$|Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections may be {{initiated}} by multiple infectious particles, {{resulting in a}} genetically heterogeneous viral population, or by a single particle, leading to a clonal population in the initial stage of infection. To determine which of these scenarios is most common, we evaluated the genetic diversity of HCV quasispecies in 12 seronegative subjects with primary infection following community exposures, six acutely infected recipients of HCV-seropositive blood transfusions and six seropositive individuals with infections of <b>undetermined</b> <b>durations.</b> RNA isolated from plasma and a region of the HCV envelope gene including the first hypervariable region (HVR- 1) was reverse transcription-PCR amplified and subcloned, and multiple plasmid clones were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that all HCV variants clustered by individuals. Genetic distances among HCV variants within recently infected subjects ranged from 1 to 7. 8 %. On {{the basis of the}} estimated mutation rate of HCV in vivo and the Taq polymerase error rate, primary infection viral quasispecies were classified as genetically heterogeneous when the maximum sequence divergence between genetic variants in the same person was > 3 %. Heterogeneous quasispecies were detected in 4 of 12 preseroconversion subjects, 1 of 6 transfusion recipients, and 4 of 6 seropositive subjects. The high level of viral quasispecies genetic diversity found in at least a third of recently infected individuals is consistent with the transmission of multiple infectious particles. Community-acquired HCV infection, predominantly the result of needle sharing by injection drug users, therefore appears to be frequently initiated by the successful transmission of multiple viral variants...|$|R
40|$|Abstract in <b>Undetermined</b> The {{expected}} <b>duration</b> {{of initial}} antiparkinson monotherapy before {{the need for}} supplementation is not clearly defined for routine practice. The {{aim of this study}} was to define the length of L-dopa (L- 3, 4 -dihydrophenylalanine) and dopamine agonist monotherapy. The duration of monotherapy and discontinuation rates were investigated in a natural observational setting by plotting Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Out of 345 patients, 180 (52. 2 %) received L-dopa and 165 (47. 8 %) received a dopamine agonist as initial monotherapy. Half of the patients starting L-dopa received supplementary therapy within 3. 6 years (95 % confidence interval, 3. 2 - 4. 6), significantly longer than for dopamine agonist monotherapy (half required a second agent at 2. 3 years [2. 0 - 2. 9]; P = 0. 00017). Discontinuation of L-dopa therapy was 1 %. Dopamine agonists were stopped (due to side-effects like impulse control disorders [6 %], somnolence [4 %] and light-headedness [3 %]) in 20 % over four years. The duration and tolerability of L-dopa and dopamine agonists as initial Parkinson's disease monotherapy are defined in this study; this may form part of the information exchange with patients...|$|R
40|$|During a 9 -month {{study of}} {{patients}} being evaluated for coccidioidomycosis, 1 or more serum samples {{were obtained from}} 138 patients with an illness suggestive of recent infection. In this group, standard immunodiffusion tests of unconcentrated sera were positive for 25; 49 additional patients had at least 1 reactive test result by newer enzyme-linked serologic tests. At least 11 of these 49 patients had coccidioidomycosis as determined by culture or subsequent standard serologic tests. Patients with coccidioidomycosis identified only by newer tests had fewer or milder clinical abnor-malities than did patients in whom the disease was detected by standard tests. For 31 other patients with illness of a chronic or <b>undetermined</b> <b>duration,</b> newer tests detected only 10 more than the 18 identified by standard tests, suggesting that later {{in the course of}} illness, standard testing gains in sensitivity for coccidioidal infection. The presence of complement-fixing (CF) and tube precipitin (TP) anticoccidioidal antibodies in sera are considered specific. markers of coccidioidomycosis [1 - 5]. In an attempt to increase the sensitivity of serologic diagnosis, Meridian Diagnostics (Cincinnati) developed an ELISA (Premier Coccidioides EIA kit) for the qualitative detection of IgM and IgG coccidioidal antibodies [6 - 8]. Unfortunately, studies that compared the new ELISA with older tests provided little clinical information. Thus, the value of these tests early in the course of illness is not clear. We have used an ELISA to demonstrate antibodies against a 33 -kDa cell wall antigen purified from developing spherules of Coccidioides immitis [9]. Here we compare several procedures in relation to disease manifestations of coccidioido-mycosis, especially those of initial respiratory tract infection...|$|E
