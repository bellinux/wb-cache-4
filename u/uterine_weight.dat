40|$|The {{objective}} was to conduct a comparative study of estrogenic activity of alcoholic extract of fruits of Solanum xanthocarpum with diethylstilbestrol in bilaterally ovariectomized young albino rats using <b>uterine</b> wet <b>weight,</b> <b>uterine</b> glycogen content and uterine histology as parameters of assessment. Materials and Methods: Bilaterally overiectomized albino rats were divided into five groups (n= 7) receiving different treatments, consisting of vehicle (distilled water), ethanolic extract of fruits of Solanum xanthocarpum at three different doses (viz., 100, 200, 400 mg/kg body weight) and standard drug diethylstilbestrol (DES) at a dose of 2 mg/kg body weight. All drugs were administered orally daily for 7 days. Estrogenic activity was assessed by taking <b>uterine</b> wet <b>weight,</b> <b>uterine</b> glycogen content, and uterine histology as parameters of assessment. Results: The results proved the estrogenic activity of extracts for dose 200 & 400 mg/kg body weight by exhibiting the significant (p< 0. 05 & p< 0. 01) result for various parameters like <b>uterine</b> wet <b>weight,</b> <b>uterine</b> glycogen content and uterine histology.

50|$|Similarly to {{estradiol}} and estrone, catechol estrogens possess estrogenic activity. 2-Hydroxylated catechol estrogens {{are weak}} and possibly antiestrogenic estrogens, whereas their 4-hydroxylated counterparts are more potent in their estrogenic activity.

40|$|The estrogenic {{potential}} of lavender oil was evaluated in a percutaneous uterotrophic bioassay in immature female rats. Four groups of 10 immature female rats each {{were randomly selected}} on postpartum day (PPD) 16. During the 3 -day treatment period (PPDs 19 - 21), the immature rats were separated from the dams, caged in groups of 5 in a litter box for 6 hours, and administered the vehicle control article (corn oil) or lavender oil at 20 or 100 mg/kg per day. All dosages were administered as a 5 mL/kg volume in a Hilltop Chamber (25 mm diameter; absorbent material removed) placed on the shaved back of each immature rat, and secured with micropore tape and Vetrap. A positive control group was gavaged twice daily with 2. 5 mg/kg per day of 17 a-ethinyl estradiol. Daily observations included viability, clinical signs, body weights, and body weight gains. All rats were euthanized 24 hours after {{the third and final}} treatment, the uteri and ovaries were removed, and the paired ovaries and wet and blotted <b>uterine</b> <b>weights</b> were recorded. No unscheduled deaths occurred. No skin reactions were observed. Both dosages of lavender oil significantly reduced body weight gains after the third day of treatment, but terminal body weights and mean absolute and relative <b>uterine</b> <b>weights</b> did not differ significantly from vehicle control values. Positive controls showed significant increases in body weight and increased mean absolute and relative <b>uterine</b> <b>weights</b> as expected. Based on these data, lavender oil, at dosages of 20 or 100 mg/kg, was not active in the rat uterotrophic assay and gave no evidence of estrogenic activity...|$|R

50|$|Coumestrol {{has been}} shown to {{accelerate}} the onset of puberty in mice. Exposure to coumestrol immediately after birth resulted in an initial increase in <b>uterine</b> <b>weight.</b> However, continued exposure inhibited the growth of the uterus and decreased levels of estrogen receptors within uterine tissue. The rats also showed altered vaginal development including cornification and metaplasia of vaginal tissue, and delayed opening of the vagina. When neonatal female mice were treated with coumestrol, similar reproductive irregularities occurred, and at 22 months old, atypical collagen distribution was observed in the uterine wall. When 2 day old male Wistar rats are injected with coumestrol daily, they exhibit a decrease in size in the lumens of their seminiferous tubules and germ cells go through increased rates of apoptosis. When bulls graze on pastures containing coumestrol, metaplasia occurs in the prostate and bulbourethral glands, and sperm maturation is suppressed. Female cows that consumed alfalfa experienced lower pregnancy rates and spontaneous abortions, as well as abnormal estrogen levels during pregnancy. A high coumestrol diet has also been shown to induce early development of the vulva and udder of female lambs. In addition to these anatomical abnormalities, exposure to coumestrol has also been shown to alter the estrus cycle of a number of animals, including cows and sheep, resulting in lower rates of fertility.|$|E

It is well established that decidualization is regulated by estrogens and progesterone (P). The present study investigated the role of pituitary hormones in this re-sponse. Decidualization produced by the bilateral intrauterine injection of 100 p 1 sesame oil was compared in ovariectomized (OVX) and hypophysectomized (HYPOX) -OVX rats. All animals were treated with a sequence of I 7 a-estradiol (E 2) and P that in OVX rats supported decidualization. As assessed by <b>uterine</b> <b>weights</b> 5 days after uterine stimulation, decidualization was much greater in OVX than in HYPOX-OVX rats (geometric mean <b>uterine</b> <b>weights</b> of 1539 and 376 mg, respectively).

40|$|Recently, {{many studies}} have {{investigated}} potential estrogenic compounds in the human diet. Several of these investigations have studied cow milk, a mainstay of the diets of both young and old.

Regardless, the majority of these studies have concluded that the levels of estrogens in milk are too low to have a physiological effect. However, a recent study found that commercial 1 % cow milk was uterotrophic in rats, suggesting that it contained biologically significant levels of estrogen. Using the rat model, we tested milk samples from commercial sources and with varying fat content for estrogenic activity. Ovariectomized female rats were given milk ad libitum for a period of 2 wk. After 12 d of treatment, rats were tested sequentially in an open field and an elevated plus maze to determine any effect of milk on anxiety levels.

40|$|<b>Uterine</b> <b>weight</b> and {{glycogen}} content {{were measured}} at {{stages of the}} estrous cycle and in the gravid and nongravid horns of unilaterally pregnant rats. The response of these parameters to administration of a purified preparation of porcine relaxin (relaxin B) was assessed during the estrus-diestrus interval and at Day 15 of gestation. Both <b>uterine</b> <b>weight</b> and glycogen content were greatest at proestrus and estrus and lowest at diestrus- 1; when 0. 1 mg of relaxin was administered beginning at estrus and injected over a 24 h period, the decline in <b>uterine</b> <b>weight</b> and glycogen was retarded. During gestation <b>uterine</b> <b>weight</b> declined prior to implantation and increased rapidly thereafter to a peak at Day 22 beyond which uterine size decreased through parturition. Uterine glycogen content followed similar increases except that the peak occurred on Day 23 and was sharply defined in advance of parturition at which time a rapid decline was observed. The increases in <b>uterine</b> <b>weight</b> and glycogen were significantly greater in the gravid horn than in the nongravid horn, and {{on the day of}} parturition both horns exhibited the highest glycogen concentration in the myometrium alone.

The {{purpose of the present}} study is to investigate anti-GnRH immunization as a practical alternative to surgical castration for female pigs. Thirty-six Chinese female crossbred pigs (Chinese YananxYorkshire) were selected from 12 litters, three pigs from each litter, at the age of 10 - 13 weeks. One pig from each litter was immunized with 62. 5 g d-Lys 6 -GnRH-tandem-dimer peptide conjugated to ovalbumin in Specol adjuvant at Week 0 (0 week post-vaccination, wpv), and a booster vaccination was given 8 weeks later (8 wpv). Its intact and castrate littermates (surgically castrated at the time of weaning, i. e. at 6 weeks of age) were administered the vehicle and served as controls. Antibody titers, serum LH and inhibin A were determined at the day of first vaccination, every 4 weeks thereafter and at the day of slaughter (18 wpv). At slaughter, ovaries were inspected for the presence of follicles and corpora lutea, and ovarian and <b>uterine</b> <b>weights</b> were recorded. Ten of twelve immunized pigs responded well to the immunization (immunocastrated animals), while the remaining two pigs responded poorly (nonresponders). Antibody titres in immunocastrated animals steadily increased after immunization, became maximal at 12 wpv and remained high until slaughter. Serum LH levels were reduced (P< 0. 05) in immunocastrated pigs as compared to intact controls and surgical castrates. Serum inhibin A levels decreased after vaccination, and equaled surgical castrate levels from 8 wpv until the end of the experiment. Ovarian and <b>uterine</b> <b>weights</b> (1. 3 +/- 0. 2 and 43. 9 +/- 11. 4 g, respectively; mean+/-S. E. M.) were significantly lower (P< 0. 05) in immunocastrates than in intact controls (9. 4 +/- 1. 1 and 390. 9 +/- 67. 2 g, respectively). Antibody titers were significantly lower (P< 0. 05) in nonresponders than in immunocastrated pigs from 12 wpv to slaughter. Ovarian and <b>uterine</b> <b>weights</b> were similar in nonresponders and in intact controls. Macroscopically, no follicular structures were found in ovaries of immunocastrated pigs, while large follicles or corpora lutea were observed in the ovaries of both nonresponders and intact controls.

Methods: We examined prospectively data from 461 consecutive TLHs performed by a single surgeon between August 2004 and August 2014 at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sirai Hospital, Carbonia, and at the Department of Gynecologic Oncology, Businco Hospital, Cagliari, Italy. Demographic and surgical data were stratified by <b>uterine</b> <b>weight</b> (range 90 – 5500  g) into four groups: 800  g. Outcomes examined included blood loss, operative time, intraoperative and postoperative complications, and duration of hospital stay.

Mode of estimated blood loss {{in both groups}} was 200  ml (range 50 – 800). BMI and <b>uterine</b> <b>weight</b> were significantly different between two groups (P[*]<[*] 0.05 and p[*]<[*] 0.01 respectively). Average <b>uterine</b> <b>weight</b> of LASH and TLH groups were 373  g (range 60 – 1940) and 172  g (range 46 – 780). Patients who underwent TLH had no complications. In the LASH group 3 (3 / 109) 2.7 % complications noted.|$|E
3000|$|Results: TLH for voluminous <b>uterine</b> fibroids <b>weighting</b> 500 to 800 grams (our {{experience}} is under 50 cases of TLH) raised problems of surgical technique {{and we had}} to find individual intraoperatory solutions [...]. The surgical techniques described in materials and method allowed us to reduce the operatory time also facilitating the extraction.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, calbindin-D 9 k (CaBP- 9 k), a potent {{biomarker}} for screening estrogen-like environmental chemicals in vivo and in vitro, was adopted {{to examine the}} potential estrogen-like property of the following parabens: propyl-, iso-propyl-, butyl-, and isobutylparaben. Immature female rats were administered for 3 days from postnatal day 14 to 16 with 17 a-ethinylestradiol (EE, 1 mg/kg body weight [BW]/day) or parabens (62. 5, 250, and 1000 mg/kg BW/day). In uterotrophic assays, significantly increased uterus weights were detected in the EE-treated group and in the groups treated with the highest dose of isopropyl-, butyl-, and isobutylparaben. In addition, these para-bens induced uterine CaBP- 9 k messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels, whereas cotreatment of parabens and fulvestrant, a pure estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist, completely reversed the paraben-induced gene expression and increased <b>uterine</b> <b>weights...</b>|$|R
40|$|Summary. Twice daily {{injections}} of purified ovine and human FSH {{were used to}} inves-tigate the control of ovarian follicle development in hypogonadotrophic hypogonadal (hpg) mice. Treatment for 5 days with doses greater than 3 pg resulted in {{a significant increase in}} the total number of growing follicles and the development of antral follicles. This was associated with increases in <b>uterine</b> <b>weights</b> and vaginal opening, indicating that steroidogenesis had also been stimulated. Further studies of the effects of com-bined {{injections of}} FSH and LH, linked with morphological analysis of ovarian inter-stitial cells, suggested that any contribution of background or contaminating LH to the effects of the FSH injections was minimal. It therefore appears that, in mice, FSH alone is capable of stimulating an increase in the initiation of follicle growth, of triggering the development of antral follicles, and supporting ovarian steroidogenesis...|$|R
