500|$|Gunn had a [...] "fantastic {{rapport with}} the Norwich supporters". As a player, he liked [...] "to tease the crowd during the game". Before each half of a match, Gunn would run toward his goal and pretend to attempt to headbutt the crossbar. Gunn {{says this is a}} habit he began as a youngster, and cannot {{remember}} how or why he began to do it. Norwich fans noticed it soon after his arrival at the club and, in Gunn's words, [...] "would wait <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to about the 18-yard line and then start a small [...] "Wooo..." [...] which would build into a full-blown [...] "WOOOO ... AH!" ... I loved it and came close to smacking my head against the woodwork a couple of times". [...] During play, he would cup his ear, which would prompt shouts of [...] "Bryan, Bryan, give us a wave".|$|E
500|$|For authenticity, several British and German actors {{portrayed the}} British sailors and Nazi soldiers, whose {{dialogue}} was mostly in German. Trevor Goddard, who portrayed the First British Crewman, is English, while Madison Mason, who played Captain Yip Harburg, is American; he affected an English accent for the part. William B. Davis' dialogue was entirely in German, a language {{which he did}} not speak. He later explained, [...] "I certainly didn't realize I was going to be speaking a lot of German <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> the script, which just said 'CSM (in German)'." [...] To successfully learn his lines, one of the German cast members recorded all of Davis' dialogue onto a cassette. Davis was given the cassette two weeks before shooting and phonetically memorized his lines; he noted that the method [...] "seemed to work pretty well—at least to non-German-speaking people! It was a little more challenging because there were some real German speakers on the show, which I thought was a little unfair." [...] The only main cast member of The X-Files who already spoke German was Mitch Pileggi. Pileggi had studied in Germany; he had to re-write many of his lines as they made no sense {{in the context of the}} scenes. The tagline that usually appears after the opening credits of every episode, [...] "The Truth is Out There", was translated into German: [...] "Die Wahrheit ist irgendwo da draußen".|$|E
2500|$|Popper has said, [...] "I was a bleeding-heart liberal, <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> a job," [...] and {{describes}} himself as [...] "a libertarian who is a Republican when pushed.". Popper summed up his political position by saying [...] "I believe in freedom for markets and freedom for individuals, so I guess that makes me a libertarian." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rousey has {{discussed}} how she dealt with body {{image in the}} past and her struggle with it. She explained, [...] "When I was in school, martial arts made you a dork, and I became self-conscious that I was too masculine. I was a 16-year-old girl with ringworm and cauliflower ears. People made fun of my arms and called me 'Miss Man'. It wasn't <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> older that I realized: these people are idiots. I'm fabulous." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, Bannon was {{deployed}} to the Persian Gulf {{to assist with}} Operation Eagle Claw during the Iran hostage crisis. The failure of the mission marked {{a turning point in}} his political world-view from largely apolitical to strongly Reaganite, which was further reinforced by the September 11 attacks. Bannon has stated that, [...] "I wasn’t political <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> into the service and saw how badly Jimmy Carter f---ed things up. I became a huge Reagan admirer. Still am. But what turned me against the whole establishment was coming back from running companies in Asia in 2008 and seeing that Bush had f---ed up as badly as Carter. The whole country was a disaster." ...|$|E
2500|$|The world's fastest {{sprinter}} and runner Usain Bolt, {{who is from}} Jamaica (in the West Indies), once replied {{while being}} asked about who were his heroes {{when he was a}} child: [...] "When I was really small I loved the Pakistan cricket team. Waqar Younis {{was one of the greatest}} bowlers ever, and I was a bowler so I really enjoyed watching him. I was a big Pakistan fan <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> older, when I noticed that I should actually support my home team." [...] When asked what if there was a match between Pakistan and Windies, Bolt remarked [...] "I would still have supported Pakistan, that’s what I’m saying – when I was little, it was all about Pakistan." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fiennes {{stated that}} he had two weeks to shoot the climactic {{showdown}} scene where he is gloating over a terrified Harry, played by Daniel Radcliffe. Fiennes said with a chuckle: [...] "I have no doubt children will be afraid of me now if they weren't before." [...] In preparation, he read the novel Goblet of Fire, but jokingly conceded: [...] "I was only interested in my scene, and I {{had to go through}} thousands and thousands of other scenes which I did, dutifully, <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to my scene and I read it many, many, many, many, many times and that was my research." [...] Fiennes reprised his role as Voldemort in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 and Part 2.|$|E
2500|$|As {{possible}} {{evidence that}} the [...] "sexual song" [...] theory was created later, songwriter LaBostrie was quoted as saying, [...] "Little Richard didn't write none of 'Tutti Frutti'. I'll tell you exactly how I came to write that. I used to live on Galvez Street and my girlfriend and I liked {{to go down to}} the drug store and buy ice cream. One day we went in and saw this new flavor, Tutti Frutti. Right away I thought, 'Boy, that's a great idea for a song'. So I kept it in the back of my mind <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to the studio that day. I also wrote the flip side of 'Tutti Frutti', 'I'm Just A Lonely Guy', and a spiritual, 'Blessed Mother', all in the same day." [...] LaBostrie was still receiving royalty checks on the average of $5,000 every three to six months from the song in the 1980s.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, Executive Producer Louise Berridge {{decided to}} {{reintroduce}} the character 8 {{years after she}} had last appeared. Auditions were held to cast the role to a professional actor; however, auditionees were not informed which character they were auditioning for. The first audition was a group workshop of 30 auditionees, who were asked to perform improvisations. After whittling down potential actors from 500 to 4, {{the second stage of}} the audition process was an interview with EastEnders Casting Director. The auditionees were asked to perform a monologue {{in front of a camera}} and do a screen test with one of the actors already in the show, Christopher Parker, who played Spencer Moon. 17-year-old actress Scarlett Johnson was cast: [...] "At the second audition they gave me a monologue to read, but they'd been really careful about it. They hadn't said what the character's name was, they didn't give away anything in the monologue that might tell me who I was auditioning for. So I didn't know <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> the part who I was going to be playing--I'd been guessing for ages!" [...] Asked how she felt when she knew she was playing Vicki Fowler, a character linked to the show's early history who is the daughter of 2 prominent original characters, Johnson said: [...] "I felt very honoured, but it was quite scary. I knew there'd be a lot of people out there with expectations of what she'd be like. But it's good fun actually. It means you don't have to introduce yourself to everyone. You can really play with that [...] My family are EastEnders addicts, we've watched it our whole lives. I remember the first Vicki, I remember Michelle and I definitely remember Dirty Den! My knowledge of the show really helped a lot, because I didn't have to do any research into the character. When I joined the show, I felt like I was meeting the actors for a second time. I'd already met them in my home on TV, then I had to actually meet them in real life!" [...] The character made her reappearance in January 2003, turning up unexpectedly at her grandmother Pauline's (Wendy Richard) house.|$|E

[...] Then he raised his voice, [...] "Boys, here is a warm lodging for you for the night, and tobacco galore for your pipes; and, for those who haven't got them, cigars.

60|$|You {{return to}} your books in the wrong temper, the water trickles down your nose, runs in rivulets down your back.

6000|$|But [...] "faint heart {{never won}} fair lady;" [...] and so I went on, and on, <b>until</b> <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> a Miss Clopper, a {{tolerable}} rich navy-contractor's daughter, {{into such a}} way, that I really don't think she could have refused me. Her brother, Captain Clopper, was in a line regiment, and helped {{me as much as}} ever he could: he swore I was such a brave fellow.|$|R

5000|$|Fitch herself, in an Amazon.com blog dated December 4, 2007, said, [...] "Paint It Black {{started as}} a gothic little short story, which became the {{emotional}} core of the book, like a secret windowless room {{at the heart of}} a haunted mansion. Then I built outwards from that room, into the outer life of the book, <b>until</b> <b>I</b> finally <b>got</b> the beginning, and then the ending, which is the doorway out, into the sun." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you see, Rupert, I did {{not know}} {{at the time that the}} {{sergeant}} was who he was, and still believed the woman's story to be true. Besides, I had gone my own way, and did not mean to see any of you again <b>until</b> <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> on and could do without assistance.

The machine came over the right way up, and I fell off the top plane and into my seat with a bump.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who {{told you}} that?" [...] Sam said. [...] "If I staid, {{it was because}} I knowed it wouldn't be long <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> the upper hand of the gang, an I've done it." ...|$|E

60|$|A great anger stayed {{me in my}} sorrow. I {{would no}} longer tarry under Mrs. Temple's roof, though the world without were a sea or a desert.

The thought of leaving Nick was heavy indeed; and when he ran {{to me in the}} dark hall and threw his arms around me, it needed all my strength to keep from crying aloud.|$|R
60|$|It may be here objected that I {{ought not}} to have felt so sure as I did of the woman's guilt, <b>until</b> <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> more {{evidence}} against her. The knife might have been stolen from her, supposing she was {{the person who had}} snatched it out of the engraver's hands, and might have been afterward used by the thief to commit the murder. All very true. But I never had a moment's doubt in my own mind, from the time when I read the damnable line in the engraver's book.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} quite shaken down yet," [...] he said, [...] "and do not press {{you to come}} over to see me <b>until</b> <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> {{everything}} into order.
