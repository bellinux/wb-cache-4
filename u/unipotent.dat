25|$|Lusztig {{classified}} all the irreducible {{characters of}} G'F by decomposing such a character into a semisimple character and a <b>unipotent</b> character (of another group) and separately classifying the semisimple and <b>unipotent</b> characters.|$|E
25|$|The <b>unipotent</b> {{characters}} can {{be found}} by decomposing the characters induced from the cuspidal ones, using results of Howlett and Lehrer. The number of <b>unipotent</b> characters depends only on the root system {{of the group and}} not on the field (or the center). The dimension of the <b>unipotent</b> characters can be given by universal polynomials in the order of the ground field depending only on the root system; for example the Steinberg representation has dimension q'r, where r is the number of positive roots of the root system.|$|E

There are 23 families with 1 character, 18 families with 4 characters, 4 families with 8 characters, and one family with 39 characters (which includes the 13 cuspidal <b>unipotent</b> characters).|$|E

40|$|We give a {{complete}} set of generators for the discrete exceptional U-duality groups of toroidal compactified type II theory and M-theory in d ≥ 3. For this, we use the DSZ quantization in d = 4 as originally proposed by Hull and Townsend, and determine the discrete group inducing integer shifts on the charge lattice. It is generated by fundamental <b>unipotents,</b> which are constructed by exponentiating the Chevalley generators of the corresponding Lie algebra. We then extend a method suggested by the above authors and used by Sen for the heterotic string to get the discrete U-duality group in d = 3, thereby obtaining a quantized symmetry in d = 3 from a d = 4 quantization condition. This is studied first in a toy model, corresponding to d = 5 simple supergravity, and then applied to M-theory. It turns out that, in the toy model, the resulting U-duality group in d = 3 is strictly smaller than the one generated by the fundamental <b>unipotents</b> corresponding to all Chevalley generators. However, for M-theory, both groups agree. We illustrate the compactification to d = 3 by an embedding of d = 4 particle multiplets into the d = 3 theory. ...|$|R

The condition holds for {{all but a few}} types of rank 1 groups. A fairly straightforward simplification of Lubotzky’s definition of a cusp of a lattice is the key step to our results.

In the second part, we prove an S-adic version of the Oppenheim type problem for pairs. The proof uses S-adic dynamics and strong approximation. We also discuss a conjecture due to A. Gorodnik about�finding optimal conditions which ensure density for pairs in dimension greater than three.

25|$|Sox family: The Sox {{family of}} {{transcription}} factors {{is associated with}} maintaining pluripotency similar to Oct-3/4, although it is associated with multipotent and <b>unipotent</b> stem cells in contrast with Oct-3/4, which is exclusively expressed in pluripotent stem cells. While Sox2 was the initial gene used for induction by Yamanaka et al., Jaenisch et al., and Thomson et al., other transcription factors in the Sox family {{have been found to}} work as well in the induction process. Sox1 yields iPS cells with a similar efficiency as Sox2, and genes Sox3, Sox15, and Sox18 also generate iPS cells, although with decreased efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Multipotency or multidifferentiative potential, {{which is}} the ability to {{generate}} progeny of several distinct cell types, (for example glial cells and neurons) as opposed to unipotency, {{which is the}} term for cells that are restricted to producing a single-cell type. However, some researchers do not consider multipotency to be essential, and believe that <b>unipotent</b> self-renewing stem cells can exist. These properties can be illustrated with relative ease in vitro, using methods such as clonogenic assays, where the progeny of a single cell is characterized. However, it is known that in vitro cell culture conditions can alter the behavior of cells, proving that a particular subpopulation of cells possesses stem cell properties in vivo is challenging, and so considerable debate exists as to whether some proposed stem cell populations in the adult are indeed stem cells.|$|E
25|$|Stem {{cells are}} {{characterized}} by their ability to self-renew for a prolonged time and still maintain the ability to differentiate along one or more cell lineages. Stem cells may be <b>unipotent,</b> multipotent, or pluripotent, meaning they can differentiate into one, multiple, or all cell types, respectively. Pluripotent stem cells can become cells derived {{from any of the}} three embryonic germ layers. Stem cells have the advantage over glial cells because they are able to proliferate more easily in culture. However, it remains difficult to preferentially differentiate these cells into varied cell types in an ordered manner. Another difficulty with stem cells is the lack of a well-defined definition of stem cells beyond hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Each stem cell 'type' has more than one method for identifying, isolating, and expanding the cells; this has caused much confusion because all stem cells of a 'type' (neural, mesenchymal, retinal) do not necessarily behave in the same manner under identical conditions.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the following problem: Given a unital CŁ-algebra A {{and a collection of}} elements S in the identity component of the invertible group of A, denoted inv 0 (A), characterize the group of finite products of elements of S. The particular CŁ-algebras studied in this paper are either unital purely infinite simple or of the form (A K) +, where A is any CŁ-algebra and K is the compact operators on an infinite dimensional separable Hilbert space. The types of elements used in the factorizations are <b>unipotents</b> (1 + nilpotent), positive invertibles and symmetries (s 2 ≥ 1). First we determine the groups of finite products for each collection of elements in (A K) +. Then we give upper bounds on the number of factors needed in these cases. The main result, which uses results for (A K) +, is that for A unital purely infinite and simple, inv 0 (A) is generated by each of these collections of elements. 0. Introduction.

40|$|In this paper, {{which is}} a sequel of [PSV], we develop a {{completely}} elementary approach to calculations in Chevalley groups G = G(Φ; R) of types Φ = E 6 and E 7 over a commutative ring R using only the weight diagrams (alias, crystal graphs) of their minimal modules. After an elementary construction of a crystal base we explicitly describe action of root subgroups and of the extended Weyl group, multilinear invariants, equations defining the orbit of the highest weight vector and Freudenthal tranvections. As an illustration of our methods we give the first complete a priori proof of the central step in the method of decomposition of <b>unipotents</b> (see [VPS], [V 2], [VP], [SV], [VPe]) for these cases. Namely we prove that any singular column v is stabilised by a non-trivial Freudenthal transvection of a certain type (`fake root unipotent') {{and that there are}} in fact enough of those to generate the whole elementary group of type Φ over R as the v ranges over the columns of a mat [...] ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we show how {{polynomial}} walks {{can be used}} to establish a twisted recurrence for sets of positive density in Z^d. In particular, we prove that if Γ≤GL_d(Z) is finitely generated by <b>unipotents</b> and acts irreducibly on R^d, then for any set B ⊂Z^d of positive density, there exists k ≥ 1 such that for any v ∈ k Z^d one can find γ∈Γ with γ v ∈ B - B. Our method does not require the linearity of the action, and we prove a twisted recurrence for semigroups of maps from Z^d to Z^d satisfying some irreducibility and polynomial assumptions. As one of the consequences, we prove a non-linear analog of Bogolubov's theorem [...] for any set B ⊂Z^ 2 of positive density, and p(n) ∈Z[n], with p(0) = 0 and deg(p) ≥ 2, there exists k ≥ 1 such that k Z⊂{ x - p(y) | (x,y) ∈ B-B }. Unlike the previous works on twisted recurrence that used recent results of Benoist-Quint and Bourgain-Furman-Lindenstrauss-Mozes on equidistribution of random walks on automorphism groups of tori, our method relies on the classical Weyl equidistribution for polynomial orbits on tori.
