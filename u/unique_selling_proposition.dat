40|$|International audienceThe {{transformation}} from Fordist society to a liberal-productivist model of society touched regional development paradigms {{and the position}} of mountain areas since the 1990 s. It was linked with a renaissance of Schumpeter’s thesis of the “creative destruction” which he attributed to technical and commercial innovations {{in the sense of}} economic prosperity. This paradigm of a new entrepreneurial understanding of regions substituted the former welfare state paradigm of everlasting growth and general redistribution by trickling down effects. The new model offers new possibilities for those groups of social actors and regions which are able to develop distinctive features as uniqueness and <b>unique</b> <b>selling</b> <b>propositions</b> to show a high performance on global markets. In this sense “marginality” which is a characteristic for several mountain areas can be an “innovative” feature but at the price of losing this characteristic.

50|$|Although {{research}} in a niche market {{may result in}} changing a product {{in order to improve}} differentiation, the changes themselves are not differentiation. Marketing or product differentiation is the process of describing the differences between products or services, or the resulting list of differences. This is done in order to demonstrate the unique aspects of a firm's product and create a sense of value. Marketing textbooks are firm on the point that any differentiation must be valued by buyers (a differentiation attempt that is not perceived does not count). The term <b>unique</b> <b>selling</b> <b>proposition</b> refers to advertising to communicate a product's differentiation.|$|E

Small companies traditionally face various constraints due to their size and resources, but SME producers in the food sector face a particularly turbulent environment, including increased international competition and globalization of the production and consumption of food, shifting consumer trends and food policy developments. Changes in the wider environment demand that small food companies reassess their traditional focus on local markets and look for further opportunities through growth and innovation.

Empirical studies concerning the migration motivations show {{that it is not}} only labor market but also soft locational factors of the social environment, nature and landscape that are of high importance: A majority of the population is willing to move or rather stay at a special place because of such soft locational factors. This study examines the impact of regional marketing projects on the development of regions from the perspectives of inhabitants and tourists as well as general attributes to measure a region’s attractiveness from the perspective of high potentials. We argue that those projects that fit to the region and its <b>unique</b> <b>selling</b> <b>propositions</b> contribute to positioning and building location brand value.

Consequently, one should increase the awareness of marketing activities and regions and focus on soft locational factors while establishing and positioning a region brand...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} some of {{the challenges}} of developing health tourism in the Balkan region. It focuses on eleven countries, namely Albania, Bosnia and Hercegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Macedonia, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia and Turkey. Although the region {{has a long history}} and traditions of health tourism including balneology and spas, it has been difficult to develop destinations and facilities beyond domestic, state-supported tou-rism. The reasons for this are numerous, including instability and conflict, political mismanagement and corruption, lack of funding, limited infrastructural development, poor levels of service, and inadequate marketing. In order to research further the challenges and opportunities for health tourism in the Balkan region, a two-round Delphi study was undertaken with health tourism experts from or with a special interest in the Balkan region. They were asked to identify the main <b>unique</b> <b>selling</b> <b>propositions</b> for health and wellbeing; to suggest products and destinations; to comment on existing and desired collaborations in health and wellbeing; and to explain the main challenges and opportunities for developing health tourism in the region.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine associative- and {{instrumental}} benefit differentiation based on secondary associations as part of brand positioning. The field of brand positioning has been subject to extensive research, however, differentiation based on secondary associations and differences between instrumental- and associative benefit differentiation has received less attention. Instrumental benefit differentiation relates to benefits that are linked directly to product performance, while associative benefit differentiation relates to indirect benefits that evoke associations of consumption contexts, feelings, and emotions. We look at how the differentiation strategies vary in effectiveness with regard to creating positive brand attitude and their ability to generate benefit associations. We conducted a classical experiment on a convenience sample (N = 294) by utilizing six questionnaires to collect our data. Our research reveals that associative- and instrumental benefit differentiation does not differ in their positive effect on brand attitude, and that the associative strategy generates more benefit associations than the instrumental strategy. The results thus contradict the fundamental view of <b>unique</b> <b>selling</b> <b>propositions</b> and imply that brands could successfully acheive positive brand attitude with both differentiation strategies. Further, an associative benefit differentiation strategy should lead to a richer, more positive, and more sustainable network of associations. We failed to detect that the number of benefit associations positively mediates the effect of differentiation strategy on brand attitude. This could imply that one exposure is not sufficient in order to reveal such a relationship...|$|R

40|$|In Scotland, as elsewhere, {{tourism is}} {{explicitly}} {{used as a}} tool for regional development. This can be confirmed by the re-distributive effects on tourism spending, spread of tourist activities and attractions. Nowadays the concept of food tourism is better understood by society than previously, due to increased emphasis on <b>unique</b> <b>selling</b> <b>propositions</b> by many destinations and sophistication of the consumer. Despite this increasing awareness, the concept still needs to be understood from a supplier perspective within a regional framework. The aim of this research is to investigate and examine the role of food tourism from a supplier perspective within East Lothian. The theoretical framework which informed the study was located in the literature central to tourism product development and residents within a community, competitive advantage, regional solidarity and identity, different concepts of food tourism, authenticity, culture and the visitor experience. As such a range of perspectives on food tourism were offered which explains the range of suppliers chosen for the study. A qualitative study of eight suppliers of food tourism within East Lothian was conducted, semi- structured confidential interviews were recorded and the analysis of transcripts using a constant comparative method was driven by the theoretical framework. Concepts such as authenticity, visitor experience, local foods, marketing, regional identity, integration, motivation and sustainability were explored. The results provide an account of experiences that indicate that food tourism assumes many roles within a regional framework. The results also facilitate the development of a conceptual framework that summarises these divergent roles. Findings of this study led to the idea of concepts; Tastescapes, Smellscapes, Soundscapes, Touchscapes and Landscapes which seem to be symbolic of East Lothian. Such conclusions are important for understanding the relevance of food tourism to destinations and provide recommendations for future research...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{industries}} are become {{more open to}} conduct part of their research outside of their own companies. The industries can work together with an independent research institute like NELF Contract Research Organization (NELFCRO), the problem owner of the case that is used in this thesis research. The management of NELFCRO {{is aware of the}} emergence of many potential partnerships between contract research organizations and the industries. Moreover, the management considers improving NELFCRO’s acquisition process in order to successfully enter the market. According to NELFCRO’s experience, the acquisition phase of NELFCRO usually {{takes a lot of time}} before the customer makes a decision to cooperate. NELFCRO’s management mentions that a significant percentage of company’s time is used for reducing perceived barriers and negative thought of the customer towards NELFCRO. In order to assist NELFCRO to improve their acquisition process, this research was initiated. The main research question of this thesis is: “How can the acquisition process of NELFCRO be improved by integrating theory from academic literature and practice from NELFCRO employees’ perspective?” To answer this question, this research was conducted in different phases, namely analysis and synthesis phases. As part of the analysis phase, context analysis and concept analysis were carried out. In the context analysis phase, interviews of NELFCRO’s employees and NELFCRO’s flyer analysis were conducted. The main results of this phase are the company context which emphasized the perceived positive aspects and perceived negative aspects of NELFCRO based on its employees’ perspective. Next to the context analysis, a concept analysis was conducted by a literature study on acquisition process in order to develop the ground of this research. The results of this literature study are theoretical framework of acquisition process and list of aspects that are theoretically involved in acquisition process. As part of synthesis phase, the integration of the context analysis result and the concept analysis result were carried out. Validation of the research results on context analysis and concept analysis were conducted. The validation was part of the focus group activity with NELFCRO’s employees as participants. The focus group was also aimed to enrich the concept of the integrated frameworks and NELFCRO’s context with new ideas. The main result of the synthesis research phase is an integrated matrix of theoretical framework and NELFCRO’s context. This matrix was used to analyze the NELFCRO’s perceived aspects, which are closely related to acquisition process. Furthermore, it was used to generate possible <b>unique</b> <b>selling</b> <b>propositions</b> (USPs) of NELFCRO. Then, possible solutions to generate company’s proposed-USPs were discussed and some recommendations were generated. In this research phase, the validation of the research results was carried out. Also, in the focus group, NELFCRO’s employees were involved to think together about their company’s acquisition case based on the research result. To conclude, as the answers to the main question, the acquisition process can be improved by making NELFCRO’ employees aware of their perceived positive aspects and making them focus on those perceived positive aspects of the company. These perceived positive aspects of the company are possible to become NELFCRO’s <b>unique</b> <b>selling</b> <b>propositions</b> (USPs). These USPs are important to be emphasized to the potential customer, especially in the acquisition process. Beside the perceived positive aspects, emphasis could be given to the improvement of the company’s perceived negative aspects into more positive aspects, eventually making them potential company’s USPs. Besides the recommendations that are generated from the discussion on possible solution for NELFCRO, further recommendations are also presented in the end of the research. The results of this research can be used as the start for further study of NELFCRO in its acquisition process.
