25|$|Futures are margined {{daily to}} the daily spot price of a forward with the same {{agreed-upon}} delivery price and <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> (based on mark to market).|$|E
25|$|When the {{deliverable}} commodity {{is not in}} plentiful supply (or when it {{does not}} yet exist) rational pricing cannot be applied, as the arbitrage mechanism is not applicable. Here {{the price of the}} futures is determined by today's supply and demand for the <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> in the future.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to note that one who exercises a put option, does not necessarily need to own the <b>underlying</b> <b>asset.</b> Specifically, one does not need to own the underlying stock in order to sell it. The reason for this is that one can short sell that underlying stock.|$|E

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 68 - 71. This study {{covers the}} period from 1990 to 1997 and investigates the {{relationship}} between the volume and value of index futures trading for the three main share indices and the volatility of the <b>underlying</b> <b>assets</b> on the JSE. The results of the regression tests indicate significant positive relationships between futures trading activity and the volatility of the <b>underlying</b> <b>assets</b> for the All Gold Index and the Industrial Index. This suggests that increased futures trading is associated with increased volatility in the <b>underlying</b> <b>assets.</b> The relationships were not significant for the All Share Index. The results support the hypothesis that index futures trading increases the volatility of the <b>underlying</b> <b>assets...</b>|$|R
2500|$|An asset-backed {{security}} (ABS) is {{a security}} whose income payments and hence value {{are derived from}} and collateralized (or [...] "backed") by a specified pool of <b>underlying</b> <b>assets.</b> The pool of assets is typically a group of small and illiquid assets which are unable to be sold individually. Pooling the assets into financial instruments allows them {{to be sold to}} general investors, a process called [...] securitization, and allows the risk of investing in the <b>underlying</b> <b>assets</b> to be diversified because each security will represent a fraction of the total value of the diverse pool of <b>underlying</b> <b>assets.</b> The pools of <b>underlying</b> <b>assets</b> can include common payments from credit cards, auto loans, and mortgage loans, to esoteric cash flows from aircraft leases, royalty payments and movie revenues.|$|R
25|$|On January 17, 2006, CDS Indexco and Markit {{launched}} ABX.HE, {{a synthetic}} asset-backed credit derivative index, {{with plans to}} extend the index to other <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> types other than home equity loans. ABS indices allow investors to gain broad exposure to the subprime market without holding the actual asset-backed securities.|$|E
25|$|Note that, due to {{the path}} {{dependence}} of funding, a futures contract is not, strictly speaking, a European-style derivative: the total gain or loss of the trade depends {{not only on the}} value of the <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> at expiry, but also on the path of prices on the way. This difference is generally quite small though.|$|E
25|$|The {{owner of}} an option may on-sell the option to a third party in a {{secondary}} market, in either an over-the-counter transaction or on an options exchange, depending on the option. The market price of an American-style option normally closely follows that of the underlying stock, being {{the difference between the}} market price of the stock and the strike price of the option. The actual market price of the option may vary depending on a number of factors, such as a significant option holder may need to sell the option as the expiry date is approaching and does not have the financial resources to exercise the option, or a buyer in the market is trying to amass a large option holding. The ownership of an option does not generally entitle the holder to any rights associated with the <b>underlying</b> <b>asset,</b> such as voting rights or any income from the <b>underlying</b> <b>asset,</b> such as a dividend.|$|E

25|$|There {{may also}} be a special class which absorbs early {{repayments}} in the <b>underlying</b> <b>assets.</b> This is often the case where the <b>underlying</b> <b>assets</b> are mortgages which, in essence, are repaid whenever the properties are sold. Since any early repayments are passed on to this class, it means the other investors have a more predictable cash flow.|$|R
25|$|A further, often ignored, risk in {{derivatives}} such as {{options is}} counterparty risk. In an option contract this {{risk is that}} the seller won't sell or buy the <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> as agreed. The risk can be minimized by using a financially strong intermediary able {{to make good on}} the trade, but in a major panic or crash the number of defaults can overwhelm even the strongest intermediaries.|$|E
25|$|Principal: Sukuk investors (in theory) {{share the}} risk of the <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> and may not get all their initial {{investment}} (the face value of the sukuk) back. (The value payable to the Sukuk-holder on maturity should be the current market value of the assets or enterprise and not the principal originally invested, according to Taqi Usamani.) Bond investors are guaranteed the return of their initial investment/principal. In practice some sukuk are issued with repurchase guarantees.|$|E
25|$|Forwards do {{not have}} a standard. They may transact only on the {{settlement}} date. More typical would be for the parties to agree to true up, for example, every quarter. The fact that forwards are not margined daily means that, due to movements in the price of the <b>underlying</b> <b>asset,</b> a large differential can build up between the forward's delivery price and the settlement price, and in any event, an unrealized gain (loss) can build up.|$|E

25|$|Unlike an option, {{both parties}} of a futures {{contract}} must fulfill the contract on the delivery date. The seller delivers the <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> to the buyer, or, {{if it is}} a cash-settled futures contract, then cash is transferred from the futures trader who sustained a loss to the one who made a profit. To exit the commitment prior to the settlement date, the holder of a futures position can close out its contract obligations by taking the opposite position on another futures contract on the same asset and settlement date. The difference in futures prices is then a profit or loss.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{corporate}} bonds, most securitizations are amortized, {{meaning that}} the principal amount borrowed is paid back gradually over the specified term of the loan, rather than in one lump sum at the maturity of the loan. Fully amortizing securitizations are generally collateralised by fully amortizing assets, such as home equity loans, auto loans, and student loans. Prepayment uncertainty is an important concern with fully amortizing ABS. The possible rate of prepayment varies widely {{with the type of}} <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> pool, so many prepayment models have been developed to try to define common prepayment activity. The PSA prepayment model is a well-known example.|$|E
25|$|For many {{classes of}} options, {{traditional}} valuation techniques are intractable {{because of the}} complexity of the instrument. In these cases, a Monte Carlo approach may often be useful. Rather than attempt to solve the differential equations of motion that describe the option's value in relation to the underlying security's price, a Monte Carlo model uses simulation to generate random price paths of the <b>underlying</b> <b>asset,</b> each of which results in a payoff for the option. The average of these payoffs can be discounted to yield an expectation value for the option. Note though, that despite its flexibility, using simulation for American styled options is somewhat more complex than for lattice based models.|$|E

25|$|The seller may grant {{an option}} to a buyer as part of another transaction, such as a share issue {{or as part of}} an {{employee}} incentive scheme, otherwise a buyer would pay a premium to the seller for the option. A call option would normally be exercised only when the strike price is below the market value of the <b>underlying</b> <b>asset,</b> while a put option would normally be exercised only when the strike price is above the market value. When an option is exercised, the cost to the buyer of the asset acquired is the strike price plus the premium, if any. When the option expiration date passes without the option being exercised, then the option expires and the buyer would forfeit the premium to the seller. In any case, the premium is income to the seller, and normally a capital loss to the buyer.|$|E
25|$|Derivative {{contracts}} are leveraged positions whose value is volatile. They are usually more volatile than their <b>underlying</b> <b>asset.</b> This {{can lead to}} credit risk, in particular counterparty risk: {{a situation in which}} one party to a trade loses such a large sum of money that it is unable to honor its settlement obligation. In a safe trading environment, the parties to a trade need to be assured that the counterparties will honor the trade, no matter how the market has moved. This requirement can lead to complex arrangements like credit assessments and the setting of trading limits for each counterparty, thus removing many of the advantages of a centralised trading facility. To prevent this, a clearing house interposes itself as a counterparty to every trade, in order to extend a guarantee that the trade will be settled as originally intended. This action is called novation. As a result, trading firms take no risk on the actual counterparty to the trade, but instead the risk falls on the clearing corporation performing a service called central counterparty clearing. The clearing corporation is able to take on this risk by adopting an efficient margining process.|$|E
25|$|Expiry (or Expiration in the U.S.) is {{the time}} and the day that a {{particular}} delivery month of a futures contract stops trading, as well as the final settlement price for that contract. For many equity index and Interest rate future contracts (as well as for most equity options), this happens on the third Friday of certain trading months. On this day the t+1 futures contract becomes the t futures contract. For example, for most CME and CBOT contracts, at the expiration of the December contract, the March futures become the nearest contract. This is an exciting time for arbitrage desks, which try to make quick profits during the short period (perhaps 30 minutes) during which the underlying cash price and the futures price sometimes struggle to converge. At this moment the futures and the underlying assets are extremely liquid and any disparity between an index and an <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> is quickly traded by arbitrageurs. At this moment also, the increase in volume is caused by traders rolling over positions to the next contract or, in the case of equity index futures, purchasing underlying components of those indexes to hedge against current index positions. On the expiry date, a European equity arbitrage trading desk in London or Frankfurt will see positions expire in as many as eight major markets almost every half an hour.|$|E
