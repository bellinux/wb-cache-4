40|$|Phytophthora spp. de Bary {{are being}} {{increasingly}} recognised as pathogens that cause tree death, without necessarily having any {{clear understanding of}} how this happens. Suggested mechanisms include: •	 extensive fine-root necrosis especially on wet or drought prone sites, leading to reduced water <b>uptake,</b> <b>crown</b> decline and death, e. g. Phytophthora quercina T. Jung infection of European oaks; •	 root and stem cankers resulting from phloem invasion and cambial death, leading to death of basal buds and carbon starvation of the root system, e. g. Phytophthora alni Brasier & S. A. Kirk infection of alders; •	 xylem invasion, leading to reduced conduction, hydraulic failure and death, e. g. Phytophthora ramorum Werres, De Cock & Man in ‘t Veld infection of tanoaks; and •	 hormonal imbalance and/or damage from toxins, e. g. Phytophthora cinnamomi Rands infection of eucalypts. These possible mechanisms are reviewed, together with different hypotheses of why trees die, and the predisposing environmental stresses that contribute to tree death. Extensive xylem invasion provides a mechanistic explanation of how death occurs, but is the least frequently reported symptom of Phytophthora infection...|$|E
40|$|The {{synergic}} effect of Cyclopentane (CP) and Tetra-n-butyl Ammonium Bromide (TBAB) on the hydrate-based carbon dioxide (CO 2) separation from IGCC (Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle) syngas is investigated {{by measuring the}} gas uptake and the power X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns in this work. The CF with CP/TBAB solution ratio of 5 vol% added into the 0. 29 mol% TBAB solution can remarkably increase the gas uptake at 4. 0 MPa and 274. 65 K. The PXRD patterns of the semi-clathrate (Sc) hydrate and structure II (sII) hydrate are obtained for the CP/TBAB/gas/H 2 O system. The {{synergic effect}} of the CF and the TBAB includes two aspects: On one hand, the CF molecules housed in the hollow centers of the large cavities together with TBAB cations (TBA(+)) make the sc hydrate more stable. On the other hand, the TBA(+) displaced out of the large cavities by the CF molecules make the ionization reaction of TBAB in the solution going toward the reverse direction. Thus, the more TBAB molecules exist in the solution and form the more sc hydrate, resulting in the considerable increase of the gas <b>uptake.</b> <b>Crown</b> Copyright (C) 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{establish}} {{the effects of}} the 1995 insurance system reform on dental utilisation. STUDY DESIGN: Four categories of patients experiencing homogeneous insurance changes - public/private insurance with and without additional private dental insurance [...] were analysed. The reform was hypothesised to increase dental expenditure for the Sickfund with (S+), and privately insured with (P+) and without (P-) additional dental insurance. Sickfund insured without additional dental insurance (S-) were not expected to change dental expenditure. Volume effects were also hypothesised per insurance group. These eight hypotheses were tested using longitudinal dental utilisation data of regularly attending adult dental patients: 91 general dental practitioners provided 803 utilisation records. RESULTS: The expected increase by S+ of dental expenditure was corroborated by the results. The three other hypotheses regarding dental expenditure were not supported by the results. The hypotheses regarding volume of dental services were partially supported. The S+ significantly increased their <b>uptake</b> of <b>crowns.</b> The S- showed constant <b>uptake</b> of <b>crowns,</b> endodontics and extractions as expected. The results for P+ and P- showed the constant uptake of restorations. The P+ group also showed the hypothesised significant increase in endodontics. CONCLUSIONS: Having additional dental insurance did not seem to influence the use of dental care in this population of regular attending adult patients. The basic health insurance (Sickfund or private) seemed to have an effect on dental utilisation. The results indicate an association of (expected) treatment need and the application for additional dental insurance...|$|R
40|$|Pinus halepensis Mill. is a Mediterranean pioneer forest {{species with}} shade {{intolerance}} features. The {{purpose of this}} study is to better understand how stand fertility and allelopathic properties of adult trees influence shade acclimation of saplings. Crown growth and morphological plasticity were studied under different light, fertilization, and allelopathic conditions in a nursery experiment. We tested whether shade-acclimation capacity increases with fertilization, and is affected by autotoxicity due to pine leachates. We examined stem diameter, and crown characteristics (length, width, shape and density) in a factorial experiment with two levels for each tested factor: light (full and 20 % reduced light), fertilization (low and high rate of NPK fertilizer) and allelopathy (control and allelopathic leachates uptake). In our study, shading induced a significantly higher crown length, width and surface. Fertilization strongly increased crown length and vertical expended crown shape (the ratio crown length/crown width). Leachates <b>uptake</b> reduced <b>crown</b> length and density, highlighting an autotoxicity phenomenon. We concluded that P. halepensis saplings presented a shade avoiding syndrome and that the crown shade-acclimation response increased with fertilization but was severely compromised by autotoxicity. We finally discuss the role of fertilization and allelopathy in early P. halepensis acclimation ability...|$|R
