5|$|The {{launch of}} Soyuz TM-19, {{carrying}} the EO-16 crew, was delayed {{due to the}} unavailability of a payload fairing for the booster that was to carry it, but the spacecraft eventually left Earth on 1 July 1994 and docked two days later. They stayed only four months to allow the Soyuz schedule to line up with the planned space shuttle manifest, and so Polyakov greeted a second resident crew in October, prior to the <b>undocking</b> of Soyuz TM-19, when the EO-17 crew arrived in Soyuz TM-20.|$|E
5|$|The next NASA {{astronaut}} {{to stay on}} Mir was Michael Foale. Foale and Russian {{mission specialist}} Elena Kondakova boarded Mir from Atlantis on mission STS-84. The STS-84 crew transferred 249 items between the two spacecraft, along with water, experiment samples, supplies and hardware. One of the first items transferred to Mir was an Elektron oxygen-generating unit. Atlantis was stopped three times while backing away during the <b>undocking</b> sequence on May 21. The aim was to collect data from a European sensor device designed for future rendezvous of ESA's Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) with the International Space Station.|$|E
5|$|The EO-13 crew {{departed}} on 22 July, {{and soon}} after Mir passed through the annual Perseid meteor shower, during which the station was hit by several particles. A spacewalk was conducted on 28 September to inspect the station's hull, but no serious damage was reported. Soyuz TM-18 arrived on 10 January 1994 carrying the EO-15 crew (including Valeri Polyakov, who was to remain on Mir for 14 months), and Soyuz TM-17 left on 14 January. The <b>undocking</b> was unusual in that the spacecraft was to pass along Kristall {{in order to obtain}} photographs of the APAS to assist in the training of space shuttle pilots. Due to an error in setting up the control system, the spacecraft struck the station a glancing blow during the manoeuvre, scratching the exterior of Kristall.|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{point out}} that kennel clubs with breed {{standards}} that do not make allowance for uncropped or <b>undocked</b> dogs put pressure on owners and breeders to continue the practice. Although the American Kennel Club (AKC) says {{that it has no}} rules that require docking or that make <b>undocked</b> animals ineligible for the show ring, standards for many breeds put <b>undocked</b> animals at a disadvantage for the conformation show ring. The American breed standard for boxers, for example, recommends that an <b>undocked</b> tail be [...] "severely penalized." ...|$|R

25|$|After a crew {{farewell}} Endeavour undocked {{from the}} ISS at 17:26 UTC. Unlike most other launches, hatch closure, which happened at 15:08 UTC, and <b>undocking</b> {{happened on the}} same day due to the extended delay in launching and the arrival of the Progress 34 cargo craft. After <b>undocking</b> Hurley began a fly around of the station giving the shuttle crew an opportunity to photograph the station's current configuration in all directions. Then a final separation burn was completed at 3:09pm EDT.|$|E
25|$|Shuttle {{crew members}} were awakened at 06:29 UTC. <b>Undocking</b> {{operations}} began {{about an hour}} before the separation of the shuttle and the Space Station. The two spacecraft undocked at 09:53 UTC. The total docked time was 6 days, 17 hours and 2 minutes. After <b>undocking,</b> Wilmore piloted Atlantis to a point about 450 feet ahead of the station, then, began a flyaround. Once the flyaround was completed, Atlantis performed separation burns to increase the distance between the shuttle and the ISS and left the Space Station complex area at about 10:36 UTC.|$|E
25|$|The STS-135 crew {{returned}} the MPLM back to Atlantis's payload bay on flight day 12, closed the hatches between the Space Station and the Shuttle {{and prepared for}} next day's <b>undocking.</b>|$|E

25|$|At 17:43 UTC, Atlantis’ astronauts bid {{farewell}} to the Station's crew inside the Harmony module and crossed the threshold into the shuttle. The hatches between space shuttle and the International Space Station were closed at 18:12 UTC {{in preparation for the}} Atlantis’ <b>undocking.</b> The hatch closure ended 5 days, 23 hours and 44 minutes of joint time between Atlantis and the station crews. Atlantis crew used their first hour separated from the station crew to get ready for <b>undocking.</b> They checked out rendezvous tools and set up a centerline camera and carried out leak checks on the Orbiter Docking System (ODS).|$|E
25|$|Discovery {{conducted}} {{its final}} <b>undocking</b> from the ISS on Flight Day 12, and its last fly-around preceded the final {{separation from the}} station. A late inspection of Discoverys Thermal Protection System was conducted using the OBSS, before the OBSS was berthed.|$|E
25|$|Space Shuttle Discovery {{successfully}} undocked {{from the}} International Space Station (ISS) at 12:52 UTC (08:52 EDT). Discovery was docked to the ISS for 10 days, 5 hours and 8 minutes. After Discovery {{departed from the}} ISS, pilot Jim Dutton {{took control of the}} shuttle and performed a fly around of the space station. The <b>undocking</b> was preceded by a farewell ceremony, where shuttle commander Alan Poindexter and station commander Oleg Kotov said farewells on behalf of their crews. After <b>undocking</b> the shuttle crew stowed the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS) and the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS) since they will not be needed {{for the rest of the}} flight. The crew was also informed that Discoverys heat shield was cleared for re-entry into Earth's atmosphere.|$|E

25|$|Shortly after hatches {{between the}} two {{spacecraft}} were closed, the crew returned to Atlantis. They carried out tasks {{to prepare for the}} <b>undocking</b> from the Space Station. Ferguson and Hurley installed the centerline camera while hatch leak checks were still under way. Hurley and Walheim also checked out the rendezvous tools.|$|E
25|$|During the Mission Status briefing, Alibaruho {{expressed}} how pleased {{the teams}} {{on the ground}} were with the successful deployment of the arrays, and commended the crew on the deployment activities. Mission Management Team Chairman LeRoy Cain noted that the team {{was working on a}} revised timetable to allow critical experiment samples to return to earth safely. The samples need to be kept in a cold environment, and in the event weather delayed the landing, the team evaluated the best way to preserve the samples. The team approved a revised flight plan that allows Discovery to delay hatch closure and <b>undocking</b> slightly, to allow the samples to be kept inside the station's freezer longer, while still protecting the landing date of 28 March. Instead of closing the hatch the night before <b>undocking,</b> the hatch would be closed on the same day, flight day eleven.|$|E
25|$|Ground {{engineers}} {{declared that}} a minor ring misalignment on Atlantis' Orbiter Docking System (ODS) {{is of no}} issue. They cleared the system for <b>undocking</b> and redocking with the space station—a safe haven scenario which would only be initiated in the event Atlantis has {{to return to the}} ISS. The docking ring had lost alignment during ring extension on flight day 2.|$|E

25|$|In {{their final}} day of joint operations, the two crews had some off-duty time, spoke to reporters, and shared a Thanksgiving Day meal together. Following the meal, the crews worked on last minute transfers, and {{gathered}} in the Harmony node to bid farewell. The hatches between the two vehicles were closed 23:31 UTC, with the crew of Endeavour reviewing the procedures and tools they would use the next day for <b>undocking,</b> scheduled for 14:47 UTC.|$|E
25|$|Just {{before the}} crew {{prepared}} to go for sleep, CAPCOM Megan McArthur notified them that the flight controllers thought that the GPC-4 failure {{was caused by a}} single event upset (teams on the ground listed a Coronal Mass Ejection as one of three potential contributing factors) and that GPC-4 was a healthy machine. Furthermore, she mentioned that the plan was to assign systems management (SM) to GPC-4 the next morning and if no further problems arose, it was to be kept for <b>undocking.</b>|$|E
25|$|On STS-131, {{the docking}} target on the ISS was {{enhanced}} with reflectors, {{to allow for}} the characterization of the Orion Rel-Nav sensors' performance during STS-134's rendezvous and proximity operations with the ISS. These proximity operations were tested during approach and docking, <b>undocking,</b> flyaround (time permitting), and during a modified separation from the ISS. During the modified separation, the crew performed a series of re-rendezvous burns that put the orbiter on an Orion-like rendezvous profile. Afterwards, instead of re-docking to the ISS, the crew performed a full separation.|$|E

25|$|Each {{permanent}} crew {{is given}} an expedition number. Expeditions {{run up to}} six months, from launch until <b>undocking,</b> an 'increment' covers the same time period, but includes cargo ships and all activities. Expeditions 1 to 6 consisted of 3 person crews, Expeditions 7 to 12 were reduced to the safe minimum of two following {{the destruction of the}} NASA Shuttle Columbia. From Expedition 13 the crew gradually increased to 6 around 2010. With the arrival of the American Commercial Crew vehicles {{in the middle of the}} 2010s, expedition size may be increased to seven crew members, the number ISS is designed for.|$|E
25|$|A dock {{can allow}} some laptop {{computers}} {{to become a}} substitute for a desktop computer, without sacrificing the mobile computing functionality of the machine. Portable computers can dock and undock hot, cold or standby, depending on {{the capabilities of the}} system. In a cold dock or undock, one completely shuts the computer down before docking/undocking. In a hot dock or undock, the computer remains running when docked/undocked. Standby docking or <b>undocking,</b> an intermediate style used in some designs, allows the computer to be docked/undocked while powered on, but requires that it be placed into a sleep mode prior to docking/undocking.|$|E
25|$|On flight day 12, {{space shuttle}} Discovery {{successfully}} undocked from the International Space Station at 19:26 UTC. After <b>undocking,</b> the shuttle backed out and performed a fly around of the ISS. The space shuttle then performed 2 separation burns using its thrusters. After the separation burns, astronauts Kevin Ford, José Hernández and Christer Fuglesang used the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS) {{to inspect the}} shuttle's Thermal Protection System (TPS). When they completed that task the OBSS was berthed on the starboard sill of the payload bay and the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS) was powered down.|$|E
