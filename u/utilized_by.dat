5|$|Cyclone Amara brought stormy {{conditions}} to Rodrigues in December2013. Amara {{was the first}} named storm in the southwest Indian Ocean during the later half of 2013, and developed from a disturbance within the monsoon trough on December14. The following day, the system attained tropical depression status. Despite its ill-defined organization, the depression was able to continue strengthening, reaching moderate tropical storm status on December16 as it tracked southwest. Situated in a favorable atmospheric environment, a period of rapid intensification ensued after Amara reached tropical cyclone status on December18. After fluctuating in strength, the cyclone peaked with maximum sustained winds of 205km/h (125mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 933mbar (hPa; 27.55inHg) on December21, making it an intense tropical cyclone based on the intensity scale <b>utilized</b> <b>by</b> Météo-France. Shortly after, wind shear strengthened as Amara tracked southeast, resulting in a weakening phase. The shearing effects caused the cyclone to rapidly decay, and by December23, Amara degenerated into a remnant low.|$|E

5|$|In {{the northwestern}} Atlantic, the roughtail {{stingray}} is listed under Least Concern; {{it is not}} targeted or <b>utilized</b> <b>by</b> commercial fisheries, though inconsequential numbers are captured incidentally in trawls and on demersal longlines. Historically, it was sometimes ground up for fertilizer. In the Mediterranean, intensive fishing occurs in the habitat of the roughtail stingray, and it is caught incidentally by artisanal and commercial fishers using trawls, longlines, gillnets, and handlines. Though no specific data is available on this species, declines of other species and its intrinsic susceptibility to depletion have led it to be assessed as Near Threatened in the region. In the southwestern Atlantic, the roughtail stingray and other large rays are heavily fished using demersal trawls, gillnets, longlines, and hook-and-line; this fishing pressure is liable to increase due to growing commercial interest in using large stingrays for minced fish products. Anecdotal reports suggest that landings of this species are decreasing, leading to a regional assessment of Near Threatened.|$|E
