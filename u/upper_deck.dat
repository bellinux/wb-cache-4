5|$|General Admirals {{armament}} {{was made}} and installed in Russia. Her battery deck carried thirty-six 60-pounder muzzle-loading guns and four long 36-pounder chase guns. The <b>upper</b> <b>deck</b> had twenty-four 60-pounder guns and two long 36-pounder chase guns. Two 3-pood shell guns were mounted fore and aft on revolving platforms. In 1862 her armament was revised and two 60-pounder and the two long 36-pounder guns on her <b>upper</b> <b>deck</b> were removed. Four years later, it was rearranged with two 60-pounders moved from her <b>upper</b> <b>deck</b> to the lower deck and two long 36-pounders moved from the lower deck to the <b>upper</b> <b>deck.</b>|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1915, {{the main}} deck 6-inch guns of the Monmouth-class ships {{were moved to}} the <b>upper</b> <b>deck</b> and given gun shields; their casemates were plated over to improve the ships' seakeeping. The 12-pounder guns {{displaced}} by the transfer were repositioned elsewhere. At {{some point in the}} war, three 3-pounder anti-aircraft guns were installed on the <b>upper</b> <b>deck.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bobby Bonilla {{hit one of}} {{the only}} 13 home runs ever hit into the <b>upper</b> <b>deck</b> of Three Rivers Stadium, and one of the six to the right-field side. Willie Stargell is the all-time leader in <b>upper</b> <b>deck</b> shots at the stadium, hitting four of the {{remaining}} five right-field blasts; Mark Whiten hit the other. The left-field <b>upper</b> <b>deck</b> had been reached by Jeff Bagwell twice, and Bob Robertson, Greg Luzinski, Howard Johnson, Glenallen Hill and Devon White (his home run struck the facade) once each.|$|E

5|$|By Day 20 {{the forward}} {{part of the}} bow was in {{position}} and the hull plating was well underway. By Day 55 all of the <b>upper</b> <b>deck</b> beams were in place and by Day 83 the <b>upper</b> <b>deck</b> plates were in position. By Day 125 (4 February) the hull was finished.|$|E
5|$|The 747 {{line was}} further {{developed}} with {{the launch of}} the 747-300 in 1980. The 300 series resulted from Boeing studies to increase the seating capacity of the 747, during which modifications such as fuselage plugs and extending the <b>upper</b> <b>deck</b> over {{the entire length of the}} fuselage were rejected. The first 747-300, completed in 1983, included a stretched <b>upper</b> <b>deck,</b> increased cruise speed, and increased seating capacity. The -300 variant was previously designated 747SUD for stretched <b>upper</b> <b>deck,</b> then 747-200 SUD, followed by 747EUD, before the 747-300 designation was used. Passenger, short range and combination freighter-passenger versions of the 300 series were produced.|$|E
5|$|The first 747-100s {{were built}} with six <b>upper</b> <b>deck</b> windows (three per side) to {{accommodate}} upstairs lounge areas. Later, as airlines {{began to use}} the <b>upper</b> <b>deck</b> for premium passenger seating instead of lounge space, Boeing offered a ten-window <b>upper</b> <b>deck</b> as an option. Some early -100s were retrofitted with the new configuration. The -100 was equipped with Pratt & Whitney JT9D-3A engines. No freighter version of this model was developed, but many 747-100s were converted into freighters. A total of 167 747-100s were built.|$|E

50|$|The early trams had open <b>upper</b> <b>decks,</b> {{a form of}} roll top {{retractable}} cover, {{known as}} the 'Kennington roof' was trialled on the roofless trams in 1904; these were not totally successful, and fixed roofs were installed from 1906 onwards. From 1919 the drivers positions and the balcony's of the <b>upper</b> <b>decks</b> began to be enclosed.|$|R

5|$|Two 274-millimetre Modèle 1870 {{guns were}} mounted in barbettes on the <b>upper</b> <b>deck,</b> one {{gun at the}} forward corner of the battery, with the {{remaining}} six 274-millimetre Modèle 1870 guns on the battery deck below the barbettes. Eight 138-millimetre Modèle 1870 guns were on the <b>upper</b> <b>deck,</b> fore and aft of the barbettes, and on the battery deck.|$|E

5|$|Rossia {{returned}} to Kronstadt, arriving on 8 April 1906, {{where she was}} given a lengthy refit that was finished in 1909. Her engines and boilers were reconditioned, her mainmast was removed and she received additional six-inch guns. Six more guns in lightly armored casemates were added on the <b>upper</b> <b>deck,</b> positioned on each side in the intervals between the main-deck six-inch guns. In addition the bow gun {{was moved to the}} <b>upper</b> <b>deck</b> to allow it to fire to each side. This increased the ship's broadside by four guns.|$|E

5|$|A {{collectable}} {{card game}} {{based on the}} Shaman King series was produced by Tomy in Japan and released in the United States by <b>Upper</b> <b>Deck</b> in 2005. <b>Upper</b> <b>Deck</b> originally planned a mass market release of the game for January 2005, however, it was later announced that Blockbuster Video would have exclusive rights to sell the game from January 28 to February 15, 2005, after which it would be released to other retailers. In an interview with Upper Deck's Director of Brand and New Product Development, Cory Jones stated {{that it was the}} television show's underperformance and later cancellation which led to the cancellation of the trading card game.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} in the war, the main deck six-inch guns of the Devonshire-class ships were moved to the <b>upper</b> <b>deck</b> and given gun shields. Their casemates were plated over to improve {{seakeeping}} and the four 3-pounder guns displaced by the transfer were landed.|$|E

5|$|The {{armament}} of the Hector-class ships {{was intended}} to be 32 smoothbore, muzzle-loading 68-pounder guns, 15 on each side on the main deck and one each fore and aft as chase guns on the <b>upper</b> <b>deck.</b> This was modified during Hectors construction to four rifled 110-pounder breech-loading guns mounted on the <b>upper</b> <b>deck</b> and twenty-four 68-pounders on the broadside. Valiant, due to the delays in her construction and a shortage of guns, never received any of these guns. The breech-loading guns were a new design from Armstrong and much was hoped for them. To partially alleviate their overweight condition the ships were not fully armed and only received four 110-pounders on the <b>upper</b> <b>deck</b> and twenty 68-pounders on the main deck behind armour. Firing tests carried out in September 1861 against an armoured target, however, proved that the 110-pounder was inferior to the 68-pounder smoothbore gun in armour penetration and repeated incidents of breech explosions during the Battles for Shimonoseki and the Bombardment of Kagoshima in 1863–64 caused the navy to withdraw the gun from service shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|A major {{accident}} {{occurred at the}} bridge in August 1931. The paddle steamer E.R.O. struck the lift span of the bridge. The span had not been raised to a high enough level, causing it to clip {{the top of the}} steamer's funnel and rip apart the <b>upper</b> <b>deck.</b> High pressure steam was released during the accident causing some onlookers to believe the boat was on fire. It was at first thought the captain would be found amongst the wreckage of the <b>upper</b> <b>deck,</b> but he had been navigating the boat from the lower deck at that time. The captain displayed considerable skill; he immediately realised that further raising of the span despite being given the all clear meant it was not quite high enough. And through his actions as the boat progressed downstream caught in the current, he prevented the boat becoming stuck at the bridge.|$|E
5|$|Both {{ships were}} rearmed {{in the late}} 1860s with 14 seven-inch and 2 eight-inch rifled muzzle-loading guns. The new guns were heavier so fewer could be carried. On both ships the eight-inch guns were mounted {{amidships}} on the main deck on the broadside {{and a pair of}} seven-inch guns were mounted on the <b>upper</b> <b>deck</b> as fore and aft chase guns. Eight of the remaining seven-inch guns were also placed on the main deck on the broadside where they were protected by the ship's armour, but one pair was on the main deck further aft where they were not protected by armour. The two ships differed where the last pair of seven-inch guns was positioned: Defence mounted them on the main deck, forward of the armour, while Resistance mounted hers on the <b>upper</b> <b>deck.</b>|$|E

5|$|By February 1916, all of {{the lower}} casemates for her six-inch guns had been plated over and six {{of them had been}} remounted on the <b>upper</b> <b>deck</b> so they could be used in heavy weather. Several twelve-pounders had to be removed {{to make room for the}} six-inch guns.|$|E
5|$|During her Royal Navy {{service as}} HMS President, she was {{initially}} rated at 50 guns, {{although she was}} at this stage armed with 60 guns—thirty 24-pounders (10.9kg) on the <b>upper</b> <b>deck,</b> twenty-eight 42-pounder (19kg) carronades on the spar deck, plus two more 24-pounder guns on the forecastle. In February 1817, she was again re-rated, this time to 60 guns.|$|E
5|$|In October 1963, London Transport ordered five {{double decker}} buses {{based on the}} Ford Thames Trader chassis for special duties, taking cyclists through the Dartford Tunnel. These had a lower deck {{purpose-built}} for carrying bicycles, with <b>upper</b> <b>deck</b> seats for cyclists. Access was via a stairwell to the <b>upper</b> <b>deck</b> starting several feet above {{the level of the}} road, accessible from special platforms built {{at either end of the}} tunnel; there was also a ladder built into the side of the bodywork for access elsewhere. The design was criticised for failing to protect any passenger from falling off the vehicle, and running costs were estimated at £2,550 per month, with only £45 revenue. The service was reduced to one bus in April 1964 and then cancelled in 1965, to be replaced by the current transfer service. One of these buses has been preserved.|$|E
