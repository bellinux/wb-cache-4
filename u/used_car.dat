5|$|Biden's {{father had}} been very well-off earlier in his life, but {{suffered}} several business reversals {{by the time his}} son was born. For several years, the family had to live with Biden's maternal grandparents, the Finnegans. When the Scranton area went into economic decline during the 1950s, Biden's father could not find enough work. In 1953, the Biden family moved to an apartment in Claymont, Delaware, where they lived for a few years before moving to a house in Wilmington, Delaware. Joe Biden Sr. was then more successful as a <b>used</b> <b>car</b> salesman, and the family's circumstances were middle class.|$|E

Chapman and Cleese also wrote for the long-running television comedy series Doctor in the House, and both appeared on a one-off television special, How to Irritate People alongside Brooke-Taylor and Michael Palin. One of Cleese and Chapman's sketches, featuring a <b>used</b> <b>car</b> salesman refusing to believe a customer's model had broken down, became {{the inspiration for the}} Dead Parrot sketch.

5|$|Cordray has the {{distinction}} of being an undefeated five-time champion and Tournament of Champions semifinalist on Jeopardy! In 1987, he won $45,303 from the show, which he used to pay law school debt, to pay taxes and to buy a <b>used</b> <b>car.</b> The total winnings came from $40,303 in prize money during his five-contest streak and $5,000 for a first round win on the Tournament of Champions. His campaign for public office in 1990 precluded him from participating in the Super Jeopardy! elimination tournament of champions. ABC, the network that carried the tournament, had a policy against political contestants appearing on the show (excluding Celebrity Jeopardy!). He did, however, compete in the Battle of the Decades tournament, appearing in the show aired February 5, 2014, but finished second to aerospace consultant Tom Nosek. Because of his duties as a federal employee, however, he turned down the $5,000 consolation money he won in the match.|$|E

30|$|This study {{considers}} the vehicle lifetimes and markets of both new and <b>used</b> <b>cars</b> and develops an automobile life-cycle input–output framework that {{considers the}} lifetimes and market shares of <b>used</b> <b>cars.</b> I <b>used</b> the <b>car</b> sales data during 1993 – 2014 (JADA 2015), a 2005 environmental input–output table (National Institute for Environmental Studies 2010), and the vehicle lifetime density function estimated by Kagawa et al.

By applying {{the data sets}} to a life-cycle assessment framework proposed in this study, I {{address the question of}} how market expansion and lifetime extension of <b>used</b> <b>cars</b> affect life-cycle CO 2 emissions through the entire economy. From the results, this study examines whether introducing a demand policy with a focus on <b>used</b> <b>cars</b> would increase environmental benefits.|$|R

40|$|This study reports an {{investigation}} of psychological factors influencing student behavior to reduce <b>using</b> <b>cars</b> for traveling to campus {{from the perspective of}} the Norm Activation Model, with the addition of students’ car access, and <b>car</b> <b>use</b> habits for traveling to campus. Students from three different university campuses completed a survey on their car commuting behavior. Results indicated that a <b>car</b> <b>use</b> habit, awareness of consequences, and ascription of responsibility explain 63 % variance of personal norm. Personal norms explain 47 % variance of the behavioral intention. In turn, behavioral intention, <b>car</b> <b>use</b> habit, and <b>car</b> access explains 54 % of the variance of actual <b>car</b> <b>use.</b> A <b>car</b> <b>use</b> habit and ascription of responsibility were the strongest factors that influence personal norms, and <b>car</b> <b>use</b> habit was the strongest factors that influence actual <b>car</b> <b>use</b> behavior, while <b>car</b> access significantly influence <b>car</b> <b>use</b> habit and actual <b>car</b> <b>use</b> behavior. Implications of these findings are that in order to alter the <b>use</b> of <b>car,</b> universities should implement both structural and psychological intervention. To be effective interventions should be design to removing opportunities for enactment of <b>car</b> <b>use</b> habit, also to enhance the sense of responsibility towards the negative impact of <b>car</b> <b>use...</b>|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{model the}} resale value of private <b>used</b> <b>cars</b> in Fiji. We {{consider}} Toyota and Nissan cars {{which are the}} two relatively prominent brands in Fiji. Drawing on a sample of 175 Toyota <b>used</b> <b>cars</b> and 108 Nissan <b>used</b> <b>cars</b> over the period January 2012 to December 2012 from Car 4 Sale. com. fj website, and using ordinary least squares method, we explore the elasticity coefficients of key determinants of the resale values of private <b>used</b> <b>cars.</b> Our results show that for Toyota cars, the resale value is positively affected by model year and transmission type (manual or automatic) and negatively affected by mileage. For Nissan cars, the resale value is positively influenced by the engine capacity and model year and negatively affected by the mileage. Subsequently, both brands of <b>used</b> <b>cars</b> resale value behave similar {{with respect to the}} model year and mileage, and somewhat differs with engine capacity and transmission types...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the potential environmental benefits in Costa Rica of increasing the relative tax rate on imported <b>used</b> <b>cars.</b> Analysis of this policy instrument has been chosen because Costa Rican fiscal policy has traditionally favoured the import of <b>used</b> <b>cars.</b> Moreover, a tax which differentiates between new and <b>used</b> <b>cars</b> can be a good proxy for taxes based directly upon emission levels. The results of the simulation reveal considerable environmental benefits in terms of nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide emissions. ...|$|R
