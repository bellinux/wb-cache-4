40|$|Abstract. The laser {{weldability}} of {{austenitic stainless}} steel (ASS) is good because of the material’s high absorptivity and favourable microstructure. There can be <b>a</b> slight possibility <b>of</b> solidification cracking at high welding speeds and low Crekv/Niekv ratios. Test welds were <b>welded</b> with <b>a</b> Yb:YAG disc laser. The test material was 3. 2 mm EN 1. 4404 2 H C 700 type stainless steel plate which was work hardened by cold rolling. The test materials were welded with different heat inputs ranging from 0. 024 kJ/mm to 0. 12 kJ/mm and with 300 mm and 200 mm focal lengths. The weld seams were square-groove welded as butt weld without filler material. The edges of the groove were made by mechanical or laser cutting. The hardness profiles from cross-sections of the welds were measured with a Vickers microhardness tester using 200 g weight. The mechanical properties were tested with tensile tests. The welds were classified with radiographic verification by an accredited laboratory. <b>A</b> number <b>of</b> the <b>welds</b> were fatigue tested with a bending fatigue tester. The mechanical properties (Rp 0. 2 %, Rm) of the laser welds were almost {{the same as in}} the base material except at the highest heat input. In the radiographic classification, the welds which were welded to the laser-cut edge were classified as class B (accepted). The other welds were classified as class D or C (rejected). The main reasons for the rejection of welds made on mechanically cut edges were lack <b>of</b> penetration or <b>undercut</b> <b>of</b> the <b>weld.</b> <b>A</b> problem with mechanically cut edges, and hence the welds, is that they can be non-square and bent edge. Fatigue tests and tensile tests gave no evidence of solidification cracking in the microstructure of the solidified parts of the welds...|$|R

A product is affected by quality <b>of</b> <b>welding.</b> <b>A</b> set <b>of</b> evaluation methods for welding operators is pro-posed in this paper, based on a theoretical analysis, to assure the quality <b>of</b> product. <b>A</b> new index using a cat-egorical quantity expression to evaluate the welding performance is proposed. The mathematical relationship of welding performance, number of bad welds and the maximum tolerable number of bad welds are derived. Then, the best estimators and the deviations of this in-dex are statistically inferred. Finally, a procedure and criteria are proposed to evaluate the performance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>welding</b> operator. This evaluation method can be used in decision-making for the selection <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>welding</b> operator. Besides, it can also be used as an analytical tool to evaluate and improve the <b>welding</b> ability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>welding</b> technician and the <b>welding</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>welding</b> operator...|$|R

40|$|The article {{contains}} basic information {{associated with the}} impact of the FSW process parameters on the forming <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>weld</b> while friction welding of aluminium casting alloys. Research was conducted using specially made samples containing <b>a</b> rod <b>of</b> casting alloy mounted in the wrought alloy in the selected area of FSW tool acting. Research has thrown light on the process of joining materials of significantly dissimilar physical properties, such as casting alloys and wrought alloys. Metallographic testing <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>weld</b> area has revealed the big impact of welding conditions, especially tool rotational speed, on the degree of metal stirring, grain refinement and shape factor <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>weld.</b> <b>As</b> the result <b>of</b> research it has been stated that at the high tool rotational speed, the metals stirring in <b>a</b> <b>weld</b> is significantly greater than in case of welding at low rotational speeds, however this fails to influence the strength <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>weld.</b> Plastic strain occurring while welding causes very high refinement of particles in the tested area and changing of their shape towards particles being more equiaxial. In the properly selected welding conditions it is possible to obtain joints of correct and repeatable structure, however {{in the case of the}} accumulation of cavities in the casting alloy the FSW process not always eliminates them...|$|R

In this article, it is offered to add nanopowder to the components <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>welding</b> electrode through liquid glass at the stage of its production. This will help to enhance the arc stability and increase the strength <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>weld</b> joint, which will in its turn {{have a positive effect}} both {{on the quality of the}} weld joint and on the safety of the construction in general.

40|$|Residual {{stress is}} a {{critical}} element in determining the integrity of parts and the lifetime of welded structures. It is necessary to estimate the residual stress <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>welding</b> zone because residual stress is {{a major reason for}} the generation of primary water stress corrosion cracking in nuclear power plants. That is, it is necessary to estimate the distribution of the residual stress in welding of dissimilar metals under manifold welding conditions. In this study, a cascaded support vector regression (CSVR) model was presented to estimate the residual stress <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>welding</b> zone. The CSVR model was serially and consecutively structured in terms of SVR modules. Using numerical data obtained from finite element analysis by a subtractive clustering method, learning data that explained the characteristic behavior of the residual stress <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>welding</b> zone were selected to optimize the proposed model. The results suggest that the CSVR model yielded a better estimation performance when compared with a classic SVR model...|$|R

40|$|In any {{fabrication}} industry Submerged Arc Welding (SAW) {{is used as}} a {{heavy metal}} deposition rate welding process. The process is characterized by the use of granular flux blanket that covers the molten weld pool during operation. Protection through atmospheric contamination of the weld bead and slower cooling rate, achieved by this arrangement can enhance mechanical properties of the weldment. Selection of process parameters has great influence on the quality <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>welded</b> connection. Welding input parameters play a very significant role in determining the quality <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>weld</b> joint. The joint quality can be defined in terms of properties such as weld-bead geometry, mechanical properties, and distortion. Generally, all welding processes are used with the aim <b>of</b> obtaining <b>a</b> <b>welded</b> joint with the desired weld-bead parameters, excellent mechanical properties with minimum distortion.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyse the performances of two controllers such as Hysteresis control (HC) and proportional integral (PI) control to control saturation level in the magnetic core <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>welding</b> transformer in <b>a</b> middle-frequency direct current (MFDC) resistance spot welding system(RSWS). It consists <b>of</b> <b>an</b> input converter, <b>welding</b> transformer, and <b>a</b> full-wave rectifier mounted at the transformer secondary. The unequal ohmic resistances of the two transformer’s secondary circuits and the different characteristics of the diodes of output rectifier certainly lead to the magnetic core saturation which, consequently, causes the unwanted spikes in the transformer’s primary current and over-current protection switch-off. The goal is to analyse the performance of both controllers in terms of transients, total harmonic distortion(THD) and variations in primary current and flux in the magnetic core <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>welding</b> transformer <b>of</b> highly nonlinear system of RSWS. The simulation study has been done in Matlab/Simulink environment and presented performance analysis.

40|$|The {{methods for}} {{reproducing}} fine grained {{heat affected zone}} of high Cr steel for creep test were investigated. This research was motivated by the need for reproducing uniform FGHAZ to investigate the creep damage process and untangle the coupling between thermal aging and cavitation (nucleation, growth, and coalesce), {{and the influence of}} states of stress. The two methods for producing FGHAZ were weld simulator and heat treatment in furnace. The microstructures, hardness, and creep rupture time under 923 K/ 100 MPa were investigated and compared with the actual FGHAZ <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>weld</b> joint. The FGHAZ specimens, re-produced by heat treatment in furnace, were also crept and compared with that of the base metal at 923 K/ 110 MPa and 100 MPa. It was found that (1) both the re-produced FGHAZ showed the similar microstructures and hardness as that of actual FGHAZ <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>welded</b> joint, (2) both the re-produced FGHAZ demonstrated the similar creep rupture time and it was shorter than that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>weld</b> joint, and (3) in comparison with the base metal, the creep test of FGHAZ, reproduced by heat treatment in furnace, shows a short transitional period and early occurrence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tertiary stage.
