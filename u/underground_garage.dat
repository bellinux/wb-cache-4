5|$|In 1939, {{plans for}} an <b>underground</b> <b>garage</b> at Union Square were given to Pflueger for {{political}} reasons.

The concept of an <b>underground</b> <b>garage</b> below a city park was influential: New York builder Robert Moses requested copies of Pflueger's plans (little changed from Applegarth's) and Pershing Square in Los Angeles was excavated and rebuilt in 1952 along the same lines.|$|E
