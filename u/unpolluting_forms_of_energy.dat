50|$|T.Ohta {{suggested}} that the concept <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> quality may be more intuitive if one considers examples where the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> remains constant but the amount <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> flowing, or transferred is varied. For instance if we consider only the inertial <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy,</b> then the <b>energy</b> quality <b>of</b> a moving body is higher when it moves with a greater velocity. If we consider only the heat <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy,</b> then a higher temperature has higher quality. And if we consider only the light <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> then light with higher frequency has greater quality (Ohta 1994, p. 90). All these differences in energy quality are therefore easily measured with the appropriate scientific instrument.|$|R

50|$|Energy- The {{physical}} but non-material inputs of production. We {{can place}} different <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> onto {{a scale of}} utility depending on how useful it is for creating a product. Due to the law <b>of</b> entropy, <b>energy</b> tends to decrease in utility over time. (e.g. Electricity, a very useful <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy,</b> is used to run a machine that builds a stuffed bear. In the process, however, electricity is converted to heat, a less useful <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy).</b> Like matter, energy can neither be created nor destroyed, and thus {{there is also an}} upper limit to the total amount useable energy.|$|R
