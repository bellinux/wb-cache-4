5|$|In 2001, <b>Usher</b> {{began dating}} TLC member Chilli Thomas, and their {{relationship}} lasted for two years. In 2003, <b>Usher</b> started working on the album which would become Confessions, which contained songs inspired by the personal lives of <b>Usher</b> and his collaborators. The songs about infidelity and pregnant mistresses were inspired not by Usher's private life, but by Jermaine Dupri's own personal challenges at the time. Dupri deliberately intended to create an air of mystery about <b>Usher,</b> and arouse fans' curiosity about {{how much of the}} infidelity story was Usher's own confession. The unintended result of this was to arouse Thomas's suspicions about <b>Usher.</b> They broke up in December 2003.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} premièred on August 26, 2010 on Vevo, and was {{directed}} by Hiro Murai. The video begins in a club environment, with misplaced furniture and a shattered glass bottle. The scene goes in reverse motion, people instantly appear, frozen in a raving action. As the scene is still reversing a DJ is spinning his booth, and the shattered glass bottle forms into its original state, the clubbers and the scene then start to move in forward but slow motion and the song begins with <b>Usher</b> approaching from a set of stairs. <b>Usher</b> sings and dances, whilst moving past clubbers who are still moving in slow motion whilst he is in moving normally. Once the chorus comes in, the clubbers begin dancing and raving in normal motion, periodically slowing down; <b>Usher</b> is krumping pass them, {{moving on to the}} next scene. <b>Usher</b> slides into a room with a large lit up window as a back drop. He performs choreography backed-up by female dancers for the second verse, and then returns to the original room with the second chorus coming in. A similar scene is involved to the first chorus, but this time <b>Usher</b> is dancing with the clubbers, who are still alternating in motion speed. Pitbull then begins his verse, and is sat in a V.I.P. area with three females, with the camera alternating between him, the clubbers and <b>Usher.</b> The video ends with its final scene, in a dance off, with <b>Usher</b> dancing adjacent to some of the clubbers. Once the climax of the chorus comes in, <b>Usher</b> jumps in the air and starts freely dancing along with the clubbers, with everyone in the same motion speed; <b>Usher</b> is primarily crip-walking. <b>Usher</b> and the clubbers then perform a final organised choreography, mainly krumping, and the video ends.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} <b>Usher</b> {{flickering}} {{on a television}} in a room, before we see him in a scene dancing with blue flashing lights, and will.i.am. is shown in a similar room with red flashing lights. <b>Usher</b> is then shown with female background dancers in a white room. In the scene he dons a pair of glasses which show the dancers performing through the lens. <b>Usher</b> then dances outside {{in front of a}} concrete wall, with male background dancers appearing as shadows. As will.i.am. performs his verse, he and <b>Usher</b> are seen in their corresponding rooms with flashing lights. After this, <b>Usher</b> puffs a cigar and dances with male background dancers in an arena-like area, whilst he is also joined by female dancers with flashing lights on the floor, with the video ending with <b>Usher</b> shown on the flashing television.|$|E

Directed by his mother, <b>Usher</b> joined the local church youth choir in Chattanooga, when he was nine years old. There, his grandmother discovered his ability to sing, although it was not until <b>Usher</b> joined a singing group that she considered he could sing professionally.

Gentlemen <b>Ushers</b> to The Queen are generally appointed from retired military, naval {{and air force}} officers (and occasionally civilians) for irregular and infrequent attendance at royal events.

Occasionally they may be called upon to attend an event (e.g. a memorial service) as the monarch's representative. <b>Ushers,</b> who are unpaid, retire at 70, when they may become Extra Gentlemen <b>Ushers.</b> They are, in some respects, the equivalent to the Military Social Aides to the US President, who attend on some 2 to 4 afternoons a month to assist visitors to the White House.|$|R
