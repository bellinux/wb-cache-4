40|$|This {{study was}} carried out in order to {{investigate}} the effects of different types of resins and also their mixtures on the impregnated paper properties. In this regard, pure <b>urea</b> <b>resin</b> (100 %), mixture of melamine and <b>urea</b> <b>resins</b> with various combinations (60 / 40 and 70 / 30 and 50 / 50), mixture of nano-fiber cellulose ratios of 1, 2 and 3 percent with <b>urea</b> <b>resin</b> and pure PVA (100 %) were used to impregnate of newsprint basic paper of Mazandaran wood and paper industries. Immersion of samples in the impregnation step were done in two time of 5 and 10 seconds. Next, melamine resin was used for surface coating and then absorption of resin in the impregnation and coating process measured. Results showed that in the impregnation step with pure urea (100 %), in the respect of absorption rate and surface properties of melamine paper, the best time of impregnation was obtained 10 seconds. In the combined treatment, adding up to 30 % melamine to <b>urea</b> <b>resin,</b> as impregnation step resin, offers better properties in terms of stain resistance, cigarette resistance, resistance to cracking and resistance to hot water steam for impregnatedmade paper. By adding nanocellulose up to 1 % in impregnation resin, better properties is obtained for melamine paper. Also, PVA as impregnation resin, can be offer similar quality to pure urea in the resulting melamine papers...|$|R

40|$|Timber {{structures}} {{have been}} used in construction for a long time. The main subjects of this thesis are the reinforcement of timber beams with carbon fiber, the determination of deformations in reinforced beams, and the determination of beam strength by bending in accordance with the LST EN 408. Specimens of three different types – 36, 48, and 56 mm wide – as well as three types of glue intended for gluing them – polyurethane <b>glue,</b> epoxy <b>resin,</b> and experimental melamine <b>urea</b> formaldehyde <b>resin</b> <b>glue</b> – were chosen for the test. The latter glue was used only in tests with 48 mm beams. The tests performed with beams of 48 mm width have shown that the strength of a beam inset with carbon fire increases by 6, 15 per cent when using polyurethane glue, 2, 52 per cent when using epoxy resin, and 2, 99 per cent when using melamine urea formaldehyde glue. The reinforced beam strength is compared with the average strength of the 48 mm wide solid wood beam. In further tests, the latter beams are treated as a reference point. Other tests were performed on 36 mm wide beams: when insetting the carbon fiber with the use of polyurethane glue, an increase of 0, 55 per cent in strength was witnessed, while <b>gluing</b> with epoxy <b>resin</b> caused a decrease of 13, 35 per cent in strength. Tests with 56 mm wide beams have shown an increase of 7, 99 per cent in strength when gluing with polyurethane glue and an increase of 6, 73 percent in strength when <b>gluing</b> with epoxy <b>resin.</b> Two types of research were performed in the thesis: in the first case, the carbon fiber was inset in the middle part of the beam; in the second case, the fiber was inset in {{the lower part of the}} beam. The strength of 36 mm wide beams was compared as well: it became apparent that the insetting of carbon fiber using polyurethane glue makes no impact on the beam strength. However, the results are quite the opposite when using the epoxy resin. With carbon fiber strip on the bottom of the beam, the beam strength increased by 20, 31 per cent. When bending the beam, the greatest tensile strength was witnessed on the bottom of the beam; therefore, this increase in beam strength can be explained by the presence of the carbon fiber strip in that very position. During the tests, a specific amount of beams was chosen for a measurement of beam deformation. After the tests it became apparent that the deformations distributed very evenly. In thinner 36 mm beams the deformations fluctuate up to 27 mm, while the thicker beams have deformations up to 18, 5 mm in width. After performing the research, certain recommendations are given...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study to elucidate the mechanisms of the flame spread over a filter paper permeated with an adhesive. For this study, two typical adhesives used for general purposes are adopted. One is polyvinyl acetate resin, and the other is <b>urea</b> <b>resin.</b> The flame spread rates and temperature profiles near leading flame edges were measured. Also, thermogravimetric analyses of the samples were performed. It was found that flame spread depends strongly on the pyrolysis reaction of the permeated adhesive. The highest pyrolysis temperature is of the pure filter paper, and the pyrolysis temperature decreases with the increase of either of permeated adhesives. Also, the flame spread rate decreases with the increase of the permeated adhesive. The decrease of the heat flux from the gas phase to the sample surface is inferred to be a main cause to decrease the flame spread rate with the increase of the amount of the permeated polyvinyl <b>resin.</b> For <b>urea</b> <b>resin,</b> establishment of a residual carbon layer is inferred to be a main cause of the flame spread rate reduction. Carbon-dioxide ejection during pyrolysis reaction, which is inferred through the thermogravimetric analyses, is supposed to enhance the flame spread rate reduction...|$|R

In this study, a series of N-doped microporous carbon materials were synthesized from low cost and widely available <b>urea</b> formaldehyde <b>resin</b> co-polymerized with furfuralcohol. These N-doped microporous carbons showed tunable surface area in the range of 416 – 2273  m 2  g− 1 with narrow pore size distribution within less than 1  nm and a high density of the basic N functional groups (2.93 – 13.92  %).

At 1  atm, N-doped carbons activated at 600  °C with KOH/UFFC weight ratio of 2 (UFFA- 2 - 600) showed the highest CO 2 uptake of 3.76 and 1.57  mmol g− 1 at 25 and 75  °C, respectively.|$|R
