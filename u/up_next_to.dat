Keown jumped <b>up</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> Van Nistelrooy and brought his arms {{down hard on}} the Dutchman's back, while Lauren pushed Van Nistelrooy in the back and Parlour and Cole offered verbal abuse. Van Nistelrooy did not react and was escorted away by Manchester United captain Roy Keane, but the incident escalated away from the two of them.

Ashley tells Mary Margaret that all she wants is to be with Sean. Mary Margaret understands since her own romantic arrangement is not ideal.

David shows <b>up</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> give Mary Margret her Valentine, but mistakenly gives her Kathryn's. Mary Margaret says she thought if two people were meant to be together they would find a way, but maybe she and David need another way. She tells him he should probably go home.|$|E
5|$|The North American {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Chris Milk and filmed in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in March 2005. The music video, however, was discarded by the record label, though this version won four Annual MVPA Awards. The video begins with Bedingfield waking <b>up</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> a boombox, dressing, brushing her teeth and leaving her home with the boombox. While performing {{on a beach in}} New York City, she kicks her boombox, which comes alive and begins to dance, and she leaves the beach and walks down the street.

5|$|The {{town was}} well defended and fortified, as Navarro had {{prepared}} a {{defense in depth}} with several concentric rings of trenches, barricades and fortifications. However, unknown to the defenders, the insurrectionists had with them significant supplies of dynamite and foreign experts from other guerrilla wars, including Boer Gen. Ben Viljoen and the grandson of the famous Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Garibaldi II (news dispatches from the battle also mention {{the participation of the}} future star of many Hollywood Westerns, Tom Mix). In order to counteract the formidable defenses, the rebels developed an effective strategy that managed to circumvent Navarro's well-placed machine-gun nests and street barricades. Rather than attacking through the streets, the rebels used the dynamite to blow the walls of the adobe houses that were huddled <b>up</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> each other, which allowed them to proceed through the city house by house.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Kesha waking <b>up</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> her love interest; she then {{proceeds}} {{to run away}} while being chased by the man. Kesha walks through the desert while split scenes of her are shown where she is riding an elephant and wearing a tiger mask while crawling around in the sand. They are later seen on a boat singing and pretending to row while digitally animated water is added. It then cuts to a scene of all animation in which Kesha is portrayed as a mermaid. The mermaid and the man share a kiss; the video then jumps to a scene on a rocky hillside with Kesha walking around the sand with the man standing above on a rock. The video then cuts to another scene where Kesha is covered in glow in the dark body paint while dancing around in a cave with a python around her neck. The video ends with Kesha and her lover sitting around a campfire while still in the desert.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Ryan Key {{lying on his}} bed in an apartment. Suddenly, he gets {{swallowed}} by the bedsheets (this is where the track starts to play). The scene then shifts to Key in another dimension, ending <b>up</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the wife of another man. The man notices Key, and he runs away from the man. Hiding in the bathroom, Key escapes through a window, where he ends up on a neighborhood street. Someone dressed in dark clothing gestures to offer him a drink, when Key notices {{he is in a}} bar filled with Asian people. During part of the video, it features the band performing in front of a crowd wearing suits. The chase continues through a hallway, underwater, to a hospital bed, and back. The video is based in a scene of the 1999 film Being John Malkovich, where Cameron Diaz chases Catherine Keener within the subconscious of Malkovich.|$|E

5|$|When all mission {{objectives}} are completed, the player {{is given the}} option to make a hyperspace jump to end the level. This may be postponed in order to gather more resources or build more ships. When the hyperspace jump is initiated, all fighters return to the mothership while larger ships line <b>up</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> it, and blue rectangles pass over the ships and teleport them to the next level. The player retains their fleet between levels, {{and the difficulty of}} each mission is adjusted to a small extent based on how many ships are in the player's fleet {{at the beginning of each}} level. In multiplayer games, the objective is typically to destroy the enemy motherships, though other battle-oriented victory conditions are available. The mothership is capable of movement, and as there are no levels, the research done at the research vessel follows a technology tree with each upgrade or ship design taking a set amount of time, rather than also being dependent on a plot point. Multiple maps are available, as are options to turn off the need to research technologies or fuel consumption for smaller ships.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the saga}} {{states that the}} forces of Ölvir were {{superior}} in numbers to those of Earl Páll, it also notes that Ölvir's ships were smaller. Ölvir brought his own ship <b>up</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the earl's, where the fighting was the fiercest. One of the earl's chieftains, Ólafr Hrólfsson, attacked Ölvir's smallest ships, and cleared three {{of them in a}} short time. Ölvir urged his men forward and was the first to board Earl Páll's own ship. When he spotted Earl Páll, Ölvir threw a spear at him, and although it was blocked by a shield, the force of the blow knocked the earl onto the deck. With the fall of Earl Páll, a great shout goes up; but just at that moment, one of the earl's best men, Sveinn 'Breastrope', hurled a large stone at Ölvir, hitting him square in the chest and knocked him overboard. Although Ölvir's men dragged him from the water, it was unclear to the battlers whether he lived or not. Ölvir's disheartened men were driven off the earl's ship, and began to withdraw. Ölvir eventually recovered his wits, but was unable to rally his troops—the battle was lost. Earl Páll pursued Ölvir's fleeing fleet into the Pentland Firth, before giving up the chase. Five of Ölvir's ships were left behind, and were captured and manned by the forces loyal to Earl Páll. The earl is later further strengthened by two longships, and his forces swells to twelve ships. The next day, Earl Páll sailed to Shetland, where he destroyed Earl Rögnvaldr's fleet. Although, Earl Rögnvaldr's forces remained on Shetland itself, Earl Páll successfully held onto the earldom. Gray stated that these battles were fought in the year 1136.|$|E

25|$|One {{should expect}} that a gill {{breathing}} arthropod would modify its gills to breathe air {{if it were}} adapting to terrestrial environments, and not evolve new respiration organs from bottom <b>up</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the original and still functioning ones.

The arthropod trachea can only arise in an atmosphere and {{as a consequence of the}} adaptations of living on land. This too indicates that insects are descended from a terrestrial ancestor.|$|E
