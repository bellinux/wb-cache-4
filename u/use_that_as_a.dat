500|$|Lisa {{plays the}} {{baritone}} saxophone, and some episodes <b>use</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> plot device. According to Matt Groening, the baritone saxophone {{was chosen because}} he found the thought of an eight-year-old girl playing it amusing. He added, [...] "But she doesn't always play a baritone sax because the animators don't know what it looks like, so it changes shape and color from show to show." [...] One {{of the hallmarks of}} the show's opening sequence is a brief solo Lisa plays on her saxophone after being thrown out of music class.

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Neil Cross. Before he started writing Cross did not know Connie was the mole from the {{previous}} episode, so he included it {{to help with the}} storyline. The character was originally intended to be killed {{by the end of the}} last episode, but Cross kept her alive until the end of the finale. He wanted her killed off at this episode, as he was the one who created Connie in the sixth series, and felt it gratifying to kill off a character he created. In writing the plot, Cross was inspired by the Rupert Walters script for [...] "Frequently Asked Questions" [...] from the third series, which revealed a series of weapons caches throughout the United Kingdom set up by the Russians during the Cold War; Cross wanted to <b>use</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> way to introduce the nuclear suitcase bomb.

500|$|By {{the end of}} 1882, Riley's {{finances}} {{began to}} improve dramatically, thanks largely to the income from his performances. During 1883 he began writing his [...] "Boone County" [...] poems by the pseudonym [...] "Benjamin F. Johnson of Boone." [...] The poems were almost entirely written in dialect and emphasized topics of rural life during the early nineteenth century, often employing nostalgia and the simplicity of country life as elements. [...] "The Old Swimmin'-Hole" [...] and [...] "When the Frost Is on the Punkin'" [...] were the most popular, and helped earn the entire series critical acclaim. The topics were popular with readers, reminding many of them of their childhood. Merrill, Meigs & Company (later renamed Bobbs-Merrill Company) approached Riley to compile the poems into a book. Riley agreed and printing of his first book began in August 1883, titled [...] "The Old Swimmin'-Hole and 'Leven More Poems". The book's popularity necessitated a second printing {{before the end of}} the year. During this period Riley determined that his most popular poems were those on topics of rural life, and he began to <b>use</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> common theme throughout his future work.|$|E

500|$|Most of {{the lyrics}} were written by Manson as she {{included}} and filtered some of her bandmates' ideas on songwriting. [...] "It was a very do-it-yourself, homemade thing {{when it comes down}} to it", Erikson explained; [...] "We all pitch in. Shirley had just as many comments on the guitar parts or the sound of the guitars as anybody else, and likewise, if we don't like a lyric, we say it right away." [...] Many songs have a more optimistic view in life, inspired by Manson overcoming a desire to quit music after the death of her mother and realizing how important her work is to her. Darker themes still appear as Manson described herself as [...] "enthusiastic and passionate, but I do see death marching toward me." [...] "Blood for Poppies" [...] came [...] "from a lot of things", Manson said; [...] "It's really an analogy for a story I read about Afghanistan and the opium wars over there ... it's from a few stories, one about a platoon of soldiers in Afghanistan and the other about the opium wars. I <b>use</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> backdrop for a story about maintaining sanity in an out-of-control place." [...] " [...] remaining sane, when faced with insanity", she added. [...] "I Hate Love" [...] criticized [...] "the commercialized idea of love and what pain that puts us through" [...] along with [...] "knowing that there will be no more torture in your life than really, truly loving somebody who doesn't love you back." [...] Manson also incorporated some self-confidence and knowledge of her personality achieved during acting classes, in which she accepted that [...] "was never going to be the cheerleader or the beautiful, conventional girl who fits in everywhere." ...|$|E
2500|$|Recurring {{elements}} {{center on}} one of five primary themes. The first deals with life on the island. A running gag is the castaways' ability to fashion {{a vast array of}} useful objects from bamboo and other local material. Some are simple everyday things, while others are stretches of the imagination. Russell Johnson noted in his autobiography that the production crew enjoyed the challenge of building these props. Some bamboo items include framed huts with thatched grass sides and roofs, along with bamboo closets strong enough to withstand hurricane-force winds and rain; the communal dining table and chairs, pipes for Gilligan's hot water, a stethoscope, and a pedal-powered car. Many scenes occur at the dining table, where the castaways enjoy a large number of dishes that Ginger and Mary Ann prepare while the radio provides news and entertainment. Gilligan and the Skipper often catch fish, and the island has citrus trees to avoid scurvy and a good supply of fresh water to drink and to prepare tropical drinks[...] While most are explained due to the Professor (or occasionally Gilligan's) ingenuity, sometimes they are also explained due to the being washed up on shore or falling off cargo ships. Naturally, despite their obvious skill and inventiveness, the castaways never quite manage to put together a functional raft out of bamboo (or repair the holes in the Minnow, though the entire ship fell apart in the eighth episode, [...] "Goodbye Island"). In the television movie Rescue from Gilligan's Island, the castaways tie all their huts together and <b>use</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> raft for escape, taking advantage of a tsunami's propulsion.|$|E
2500|$|Congressman Peter T. King {{made his}} likely {{candidacy}} clear in December 2008, partly {{to mention that}} he was not challenging former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani as the latter was not in the running and partly to counter the wave of publicity for Caroline Kennedy. By January 2009, King was still deliberating over whether he would run, with the main factor being whether he could raise the estimated millions he would need. [...] National Republican Senatorial Committee Chair John Cornyn was said to support King, which could keep other Republican contenders out of play. [...] However, Cornyn has reportedly met with former Governor George Pataki to discuss his potential candidacy, which other Republicans were advocating. [...] In June 2009, due to an appointment to the House Intelligence Committee, King said he was much less likely to run. [...] As August 2009 closed, King announced officially that he would not run, saying: [...] "Senator Gillibrand generates neither strong support nor opposition. This makes it virtually impossible for me to raise the campaign funds I would need to overcome the built-in Democratic registration advantage and the countless millions of dollars which the Democrats will make available to Senator Gillibrand." [...] In September 2009, Giuliani reiterated that he had no interest at all in running for the Senate seat, [...] though, much like Andrew Cuomo's anticipated desire to run for governor, it did not stop speculation that Giuliani might change his mind, and by October 2009, speculation continued that Giuliani would run for the Senate seat, particularly if Cuomo ran for governor. On November 19, 2009, the New York Daily News reported Giuliani would not run for Governor, and in fact would run for the Senate for fill out {{the last two years of}} the Clinton term, then <b>use</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> springboard for another presidential run. [...] However, a Giuliani spokesperson quickly dismissed the notion that any such plan was in place, saying [...] "When Mayor Giuliani makes a decision about serving in public office, he will inform New Yorkers on his own." [...] On November 26, 2009, Mayor of Larchmont Liz Feld said she's considering running for the seat.|$|E

You can stand in Vienna and toss a biscuit into Kaltenleutgeben, with a twelve-inch gun. You can run out thither at any time of the day; you go by phenomenally slow trains, and yet inside of an hour you have exchanged the glare and swelter of the city for wooded hills, and shady forest paths, and soft cool airs, and the music of birds, and the repose and the peace of paradise.|$|E
