60|$|The gospel seed {{which the}} apostle sowed in those rich, luxurious, clever, learned, Romans, {{was like the}} seed which fell on thorny ground; and the cares and pleasures of this life, and the deceitfulness or riches, sprang up, and choked the word, and it {{remained}} unfruitful. But the gospel seed which was sown among our poor, wild, simple, ignorant forefathers, was the seed which fell on an honest and good heart, and took root, and brought forth fruit, some thirty, some fifty, and some one hundred fold. Epiphany came late to us--not for three hundred years after our Lord's birth: but, when it came, the light which it brought remained with us, and lights <b>us</b> even <b>now</b> <b>from</b> <b>our</b> cradle to our grave: and so again was fulfilled the Scripture, which says, that God chooses the weak things of this world to confound the strong; the foolish to confound the wise; yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought the things which are, that no flesh should glory in his presence.|$|R

30|$|The {{thesis that}} a re-conceptualisation of time can offer us new {{structural}} perspectives is instructive. The {{beginning of the}} 20 th Century heralded a caesura in natural sciences, and especially in physics, that is almost entirely unreflected in future research. As stated above, we are calling this into question purely for practical reasons. Adopting a concept of time based on simultaneity and uncertainty theories (Planck, Bohr, Einstein, Heisenberg et al.) as proposed in Luhmann’s evolution theory perspective on organisations, may be highly abstract in theory, but it has heavy practical repercussions. The fact that {{the consequences of this}} shift, which is now almost one hundred years old, have not yet been fathomed makes it all the more urgent that we do so <b>now.</b> <b>From</b> <b>our</b> point of view, the “catch-up modernism” that could refer here to presentism is thus not an implosion of the profession, but a momentous turning point - befitting a discipline that tends toward sudden leaps in conceptional consolidation.|$|R
40|$|Two {{hundred years}} ago in Great Britain, the {{political}} system was dominated by electoral power exercised through rotten boroughs, a system characterized by institutionalized corruption - these electoral boroughs were owned by local elites, and voting was restricted {{to a handful of}} people. Whilst industrially she was the wonder of the world, the political system in Great Britain was restricted, corruption was the norm, and it seemed impossible to imagine that such an ancient system could be changed. By the time of the Reform Act of 1832 however, Britain had already been going through a process of constitutional change lasting for hundreds of years – it is only <b>now,</b> <b>from</b> <b>our</b> position of 20 / 20 hindsight, that we choose to interpret all of the events since the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215 as if it were some seamless whole, an inevitable process that would lead to the position of superior moral governance that we appear to think we are in now...|$|R
