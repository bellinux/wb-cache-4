40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of <b>unsolicited</b> <b>credit</b> ratings on {{seasoned}} equity offering (SEO) underpricing in China using issuer <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> data of listed companies on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges for the period 2002 to 2009. Our findings suggest that, after controlling for other factors, a SEO firm in China with a <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> is able to reduce its SEO underpricing, on average, by 11. 89 % to 14. 33 %. In addition, we find that the underpricing of an SEO firm that receives a speculative-grade <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> is not significantly different from an SEO firm with an investment-grade rating. Thus, SEO firms appear to benefit from receiving an <b>unsolicited</b> <b>rating.</b> In general, <b>credit</b> ratings reduce information asymmetry and hence leave less money on the table when raising capital. This may lead firms to actively solicit credit ratings in the future, especially those who plan to access the capital markets...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies show}} that the {{unsolicited}} ratings of S&P and Fitch are lower than the solicited ratings assigned by these two agencies. The unsolicited ratings of S&P and Fitch are based on publicly available information for a firm. However, no previous study has examined the unsolicited ratings of Moody's because Moody's does not disclose whether its ratings are solicited or unsolicited. Using Moody's solicited and unsolicited ratings collected from a survey of Japanese firms, we find that <b>unsolicited</b> <b>credit</b> ratings are still lower than solicited ratings even though firms with unsolicited ratings provide Moody's with some degree of inside information. We also compare the unsolicited ratings of S&P with those of Moody's and find that Moody's ratings are no different than those assigned by S&P although S&P's unsolicited ratings are based on public information. Therefore, we conclude that, regardless of the rating agency, unsolicited ratings are lower than solicited ratings because firms with unsolicited ratings provide incomplete private information to <b>rating</b> agencies. <b>Credit</b> <b>rating</b> agencies, <b>unsolicited</b> ratings, Moody's, JEL Classification: G 10, JEL Classification: G 20...|$|R

40|$|Background: No <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> {{methodology}} currently {{exists for}} any of South Africa’s sub nationals. Aim: To develop a generic, quantitative <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> methodology for the Department of Health and the Department of Education combined, as well as specific quantitative <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> methodologies, for each department, individually. Setting: A comparison between generic and specific subnational <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> methodologies to assess which fits the South African subnational environment best. Studies and results obtained from other nations were used to construct the approach. Methods: In a typical <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> methodology, both quantitative and qualitative information is considered. In South Africa (as a developing economy), the quantitative information equates to a smaller portion of the final <b>credit</b> <b>rating.</b> A generic quantitative <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> methodology, as well as specific <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> methodologies, was developed. The appropriateness of these generic and specific models was tested with regards to prediction accuracies using Red, Amber or Green (RAG) statuses on a traffic light series. An illustration of the predicted versus actual ranks is provided, {{as well as an}} example to illustrate how model-predicted RAG statuses, based on quantitative information, may be overlaid with more recent qualitative information to derive a final ranking. Results: A generic, quantitative <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> methodology for the Departments of Health and the Department of Education combined was developed, as well as specific <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> methodologies for each department separately. The specific subnational <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> methodology outperformed the generic methodology considerably; more precisely, the generic models predicted a maximum of 50 % of the new cases correctly as opposed to the specific Health and Education models’ 78 %. Conclusion: The primary contribution {{of this study was to}} develop and compare generic and specific subnational <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> methodologies. A further contribution was to test the appropriateness of these models’ prediction accuracies using RAG statutes.
