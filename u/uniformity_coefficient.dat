50|$|Filter {{selection}} is reliant {{on a number}} of variables such load, duration, shape, size and distribution of the substance desired to be filtered. Ideally if the medium is too large, filtrate will be of a poor quality as it will fail to collect particulates within its matrix. Conversely if the medium is very small, solids will accumulate {{on the surface of the}} cartridge causing close to immediate blockages. In regards to the shape using grains that are round in shape have the tendency to erode due to the pressure the inlet stream may possess on the system, whereas grains that are flat (may increase surface area) however may float out of the system during backwash. Particles which are high on Moh’s scale of hardness and have a relatively large specific gravity are often recommended to be used as particle media. The softer and lighter the material is, the more susceptible it is to erosion and fluidisation. Thus particles such as silica and sand are often used as they are affordable however are resistant to the high flows of the incoming fluid.The <b>uniformity</b> <b>coefficient</b> is a measure of the uniformity of the material used within the filter. It is a ratio of a sieve pore that allows 60% of the material through in comparison to a pore size that allows 10% of material through. The closer the ratio is to one, means the closer the particles are in size. An ideal system would have a coefficient between 1.3 and 1.5 and must not exceed 1.7. Anything less than 1.3 is an indication that it is unnecessary to the system and may result in higher costs without providing any additional form of optimisation. Beyond 1.5 indicates that the system may experience a greater pressure drop and as mentioned may result in clogging, seeping of waste flow and reduced filtration rate.As a guideline it is recommended that the smallest particles used within depth filters should be placed at least 150 mm from the outlet stream to prevent fluidisation.|$|E

The system was designed to perform indoor tests for low and medium pressure sprinklers using a two radii collector pattern. The data acquisition system consisted of a PC/AT 386 computer connected to an A/D converter which received signals from 16 collector-transducer devices. The measuring principle of those collectors was to use the output of load cells to estimate the volume accumulated inside each collector Four tests of the Naan 501 -U sprinkler were conducted to evaluate the system performance. Weight readings were taken at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min during each test. The average volume weight readings taken {{at the end of}} the tests (120 min) were compared to volume values estimated rising a digital scale. Those readings were used to create an overlapping grid pattern for a 6 m (19. 7 ft) x 6 in (19. 7 ft) sprinkler spacing. Statistical parameters and <b>uniformity</b> <b>coefficients</b> were calculated for both methods (DAS and scale). Sprinkler discharge and operating pressure were monitored by transducers connected to the system. No statistical differences were found between recording methods (P < 0. 05).
