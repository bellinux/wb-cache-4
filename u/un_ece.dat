The scope of the relevant tests becomes wider and the requirements, especially {{in the range of}} safety, reliability and comfort, become higher. Of particular significance, are in recent years, tests concerning electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) of whole vehicles and their subassemblies. A survey of basic standardized EMC test methods is presented in the paper. Moreover, an alternative test method of vehicle immunity worked out by authors is proposed.

This equipment essentially affects the safety of the driver and passengers as well as the driving comfort. In order to fulfill the growing requirements in the range of vehicles safety and reliability, conducting of numerous tests of the electrical/electronic e quipment, including tests of electromagnetic compatibility, are necessary. As is known, EMC tests are e xpensive and difficult to reach, mainly due to the necessity of employing very expensive absorber-lined shielded test chambers.

Furthermore, the spatial variance of the metal bioaccumulation is analysed with regard to sampling site-specific and regional land characteristics.

In this study, the suitable development method for each design stage from a component to complete body structure was considered to make a well-established development process of a bus body structure for rollover safety. For the efficient approach of the concept design stage, a numerical model based on the plastic hinge theory was used instead of detailed shell models. After setting up the concept design for the component size and geometry, the shell model was used to confirm and optimize the whole structure composition.
