5|$|The {{stability}} of the IPK is crucial because the kilogram underpins much of the SI system of measurement as it is currently defined and structured. For instance, the newton {{is defined as the}} force necessary to accelerate one kilogram at one metre per second squared. If the mass of the IPK were to change slightly, so too must the newton by a proportional degree. In turn, the pascal, the SI unit of pressure, is defined in terms of the newton. This chain of dependency follows to many other SI units of measure. For instance, the joule, the SI unit of energy, is defined as that expended when a force of one newton acts through one metre. Next to be affected is the SI <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>power,</b> the watt, which is one joule per second. The ampere too is defined relative to the newton, and ultimately, the kilogram.|$|E

25|$|For {{semiconductor}} devices {{used in a}} variety of consumer and industrial electronics, the idea of thermal resistance simplifies the selection of heat sinks. The heat flow between the semiconductor die and ambient air is modeled as a series of resistances to heat flow; there is a resistance from the die to the device case, from the case to the heat sink, and from the heat sink to the ambient air. The sum of these resistances is the total thermal resistance from the die to the ambient air. Thermal resistance is defined as temperature rise per <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>power,</b> analogous to electrical resistance, and is expressed in units of degrees Celsius per watt (°C/W). If the device dissipation in watts is known, and the total thermal resistance is calculated, the temperature rise of the die over the ambient air can be calculated.|$|E

500|$|In 1833 Gauss {{pointed out}} the {{possibility}} of equating this force with its mechanical equivalent. This proposal received further support from Wilhelm Weber in 1851. The electromagnetic (or absolute) system of units was one of the two systems of units identified in the BAAS report of 1862 and defined in the report of 1873. In this system, current is defined by setting the magnetic force constant [...] to unity and potential difference is defined {{in such a way as}} to ensure the <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> calculated by the relation [...] is identical to the <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> required to move a mass of one gram a distance of one centimetre in one second when opposed by a force of one dyne. The electromagnetic units of measure were known as the abampere, the abvolt, the abcoulomb and so on.|$|E

2500|$|Central station {{electric}} power generating provided power more efficiently and at lower cost than small generators. The capital and operating cost per <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> were also cheaper with central stations. The {{cost of electricity}} fell dramatically in {{the first decades of}} the twentieth century due to the introduction of steam turbines and the improved load factor after the introduction of AC motors. As electricity prices fell, usage increased dramatically and central stations were scaled up to enormous sizes, creating significant economies of scale.

50|$|During {{the early}} part of the twentieth century, the French {{introduced}} their own <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> - the poncelet, which was defined as being the power required to raise a mass of 100 kg against standard gravity with a velocity of 1 m/s giving a value of 980.665 W. However, many other European countries defined their <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> (the Pferdestärke in Germany, the paardekracht in the Netherlands and the cavallo vapore in Italy) using 75 kg rather than 100 kg, which gave a value of 735.49875 W (about 0.985 HP). Eventually, the poncelet was replaced with the cheval vapeur, which was identical to equivalent <b>units</b> <b>of</b> measure in neighbouring countries. In 1977, these units, along with the stere and the livre (and amongst others, the German pfund) were proscribed by EEC Directive 71/354/EEC which required EU member states to standardise on the International System <b>of</b> <b>Units</b> (SI) and therefore to use the watt and its multiples.|$|R
