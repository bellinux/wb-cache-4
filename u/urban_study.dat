5000|$|The {{study of}} cities has changed {{dramatically}} from the 1800s over time, with new frames of analysis being applied {{to the development of}} urban areas. The first college programs were created to observe how cities were developed based off anthropological research of ghetto communities. In the mid-1900's, <b>urban</b> <b>study</b> programs expanded beyond just looking at the current and historical impacts of city design and began studying how those designs impacted the future interactions of people and how to improve city development through architecture, open spaces, the interactions of people, and different types of capital that forms a community.|$|E

The buzzing malls and their customers seem to flow in a rhythm that sets the pace, but looking at the salesperson the mall comes to a standstill for a brief moment, they wait for service the customer. Nitsch takes those moments of great authenticity when the salesperson feel unobserved, waiting, lost in thought or deep in conversation, staring at nothing and the mall holds its breath for a moment. Peter Nitsch catches glimpses of human individuality in a seemingly glamorous and commercial world that is built upon manpower, manpower and manpower.|$|E

It was published as Een stad in verval: Amsterdam omstreeks 1800, demografisch, economisch, ruimtelĳk (A city in decline: Amsterdam around 1800, demographic and economic space). This quantitative <b>urban</b> <b>study</b> was characteristic of his scholarly approach: {{he chose to}} focus not on Amsterdam's greatness, but on a period of decline, believing that such a focus could yield useful insights. He contributed to collective volumes and journals, publishing articles on aspects of crime and justice history in both Dutch and English. In 1992 he published In een land van justitie: Criminaliteit van vrouwen, soldaten en ambtenaren in de 18e-eeuwse Republiek (In a land of justice: Criminality of women, soldiers and civil servants in the eighteenth-century Dutch Republic).|$|E

He installed a series of exhibits on progressively broader geographic themes as one ascended the tower — first the world on the ground floor, then Europe, the English-speaking countries, Scotland, and Edinburgh — with the camera obscura itself continuing to project a real-time image of the city at the very top. People {{from all walks of life}} were invited to come to the tower to study and learn about their city.|$|E

After his parents' divorce, {{he lived with his}} mother, Dolores, and two brothers, Stanley and Sydney, in Detroit, Michigan where his mother was a social worker for the Detroit Public Schools. During the summer, de Jongh would return to St. Thomas to assist in his father's law firm. De Jongh, graduated from Detroit Catholic Central High School in 1976. After his graduation he attended Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio. During his college career he held work-study jobs in Detroit, Houston, Philadelphia and St. Thomas and completed an <b>urban</b> <b>study</b> program that involved travel to the United Kingdom, Yugoslavia and The Netherlands. He earned an economics degree from Antioch College in Ohio. De Jongh graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Antioch College in 1981.|$|E
50|$|Miller {{attended}} Baylor University {{and studied}} Communications, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1966. Following his graduation from Baylor and marriage to Kathryn Buffington, Miller entered the Metropolitan <b>Urban</b> <b>Study</b> Program in New York City directed by Bill Webber of East Harlem Protestant Parish. While {{participating in the}} study program, Miller also worked for WCBS NewsRadio 880. In 1968, the Millers moved to Austin, Texas where Miller served as an associate minister of First Baptist Church. It was there in March, 1969 that Miller met Peter, Paul and Mary and convinced them to allow him to make a documentary of their music and activism. That documentary, called The Song is Love, was among the first films made on Peter, Paul and Mary. The film, shot and directed by Tobe Hooper, aired on PBS for ten years starting in Easter 1970. The Song is Love was a major fund-raising event for PBS during the seventies.|$|E
5000|$|Le Corbusier, as always, was rhapsodic {{about his}} project; “It {{will be a}} city of trees,” he wrote, “of flowers and water, of houses as simple as those {{at the time of}} Homer, and of a few splendid edifices of the highest level of modernism, where the rules of {{mathematics}} will reign.”. [...] His plan called for residential, commercial and industrial areas, along with parks and a transportation infrastructure. In the middle was the capitol, a complex of four major government buildings; the Palace of the National Assembly, the High Court of Justice; the Palace of Secretariat of Ministers, and the Palace of the Governor. For financial and political reasons, the Palace of the Governor was dropped well into the construction of the city, throwing the final project somewhat off-balance. From the beginning, Le Corbusier worked, as he reported, “Like a forced laborer.” He dismissed the earlier American plan as “Faux-Moderne” and overly filled with parking spaces roads. His intent was to present what he had learned in forty years of <b>urban</b> <b>study,</b> and also to show the French government the opportunities they had missed in not choosing him to rebuild French cities after the War. His design made use of many of his favorite ideas; an architectural promenade, incorporating the local landscape and the sunlight and shadows into the design; the use of the Modulor to give a correct human scale to each element; and his favorite symbol, the open hand; (“the hand is open to give and to receive'.”) He placed a monumental open hand statue in a prominent place in the design.|$|E

However, much of the existing research in this emergent public health field is hindered by methodological limitations, including: population and site homogeneity, reliance on self-report measures, aggregated measures of PA, and inadequate statistical modeling. As an integral component of multi-country collaborative research, the Understanding the Relationship between Activity and Neighbourhoods (<b>URBAN)</b> <b>Study</b> seeks to overcome these limitations by determining the strengths of association between detailed measures of the neighborhood built environment with PA levels across multiple domains and body size measures in adults and children.

A current need in comparative <b>urban</b> <b>study</b> is universal conceptualization of these complex concepts. Empirical confirmation of explanations for these concepts requires, at minimum, their valid, comparative measurement in differing regional and national contexts. Uni-versal dimensions of these concepts guide the development of systematic, cumulative inquiry {{in the field of}} comparative urban politics. Most work in urban politics is toward explanation for urban policy. ’ In this regard, typically, we include urban socio-economic characteristics and such political variables as demand-making and conflict, decision-making and power structure, and intergovernmental relations. Curiously, the concept of urban policy is essentially undeveloped. ’ Consequently, it is difficult to evaluate comparative research findings on urban policy variations even within the relatively homogeneous United States...|$|E
