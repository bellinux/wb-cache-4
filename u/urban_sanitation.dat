Lastly, the conclusion comes that willing participation of community people should be made a priority if Nigerian cities will experience sustainable environmental sanitation...|$|R

Among the achievements is {{a substantial increase in}} access to water supply and sanitation between 1990 and 2010, nearly universal metering, and increased investment in wastewater treatment since 2007. Among the challenges are continued widespread water pollution, poor service quality, low access to improved sanitation in rural areas, poor sustainability of rural water systems, insufficient cost recovery for <b>urban</b> <b>sanitation,</b> and the declining availability of foreign grant and soft loan funding as the Vietnamese economy grows and donors shift to loan financing. The government also promotes increased cost recovery through tariff revenues and has created autonomous water utilities at the provincial level, but the policy has had mixed success as tariff levels remain low and some utilities have engaged in activities outside their mandate.|$|E

25|$|Distinct {{characteristics}} of urban planning from {{remains of the}} cities of Harappa, Lothal, Dholavira, and Mohenjo-daro in the Indus Valley Civilisation (in modern-day northwestern India and Pakistan) lead archeologists to interpret them as the earliest known examples of deliberately planned and managed cities. The streets {{of many of these}} early cities were paved and laid out at right angles in a grid pattern, with a hierarchy of streets from major boulevards to residential alleys. Archaeological evidence suggests that many Harrapan houses were laid out to protect from noise and to enhance residential privacy; many also had their own water wells, probably both for sanitary and for ritual purposes. These ancient cities were unique in that they often had drainage systems, seemingly tied to a well-developed ideal of <b>urban</b> <b>sanitation.</b> Cities laid out on the grid plan could have been an outgrowth of agriculture based on rectangular fields.|$|E

As of 2011, Mysore gets 42.5milliongallons water per day. Mysore sometimes faces water crises, mainly {{during the summer months}} (March–June) and in years of low rainfall. The city has had an underground drainage system since 1904. The entire sewage from the city drains into four valleys: Kesare, Malalavadi, Dalavai and Belavatha.

In November 2008 the {{government}} of India launched a national <b>urban</b> <b>sanitation</b> policy {{with the goal of}} creating what it calls [...] "totally sanitized cities" [...] that are open-defecation free, safely collect and treat all their wastewater, eliminate manual scavenging and collect and dispose solid waste safely. As of 2010, 12 states {{were in the process of}} elaborating or had completed state sanitation strategies on the basis of the policy. 120 cities are in the process of preparing city sanitation plans. Furthermore, 436 cities rated themselves in terms of their achievements and processes concerning sanitation in an effort supported by the Ministry of Urban Development with the assistance of several donors. About 40% of the cities were in the [...] "red category" [...] (in need of immediate remedial action), more than 50% were in the [...] "black category" [...] (needing considerable improvement) and only a handful of cities were in the [...] "blue category" [...] (recovering). Not a single city was included in the [...] "green category" [...] (healthy and clean city). [...] The rating serves as a baseline to measure improvements in the future and to prioritize actions. The government intends to award a prize called Nirmal Shahar Puraskar to the best sanitation performers.|$|E

[...] In 2009 the government introduced the policy of “socialization” or “equitization” of water supply companies through Prime Minister Instruction 854/2009.
