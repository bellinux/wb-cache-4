25|$|Actually, all {{bodies are}} {{electrified}}, but may appear not electrified {{because of the}} relatively similar charge of neighboring objects in the environment.

500|$|Howe and {{his troops}} began to arrive outside New York Harbour {{and made an}} uncontested landing on Staten Island to the west in early July. Howe, whose orders from Lord George Germain, the Secretary of State {{responsible}} for directing the war from Westminster, were fairly clear that he should avoid conflict {{before the arrival of}} reinforcements, then waited <b>until</b> <b>those</b> reinforcements arrived in mid-August, along with the naval commander, his brother Richard. This delay proved to be somewhat costly, since the Americans used this time to improve fortifications on northwestern Long Island (at Brooklyn Heights along the East River shoreline) and increased the size of their Continental Army with additional militia. After moving most of his army by amphibious barges across the Verazzano Narrows to southwestern Long Island without opposition, he attacked the American positions on 27 August in {{what became known as the}} Battle of Long Island. [...] In a well-executed manoeuvre, a large column led by Howe and Clinton passed around the American left flank, through the lightly guarded Jamaica Pass far to the east, (a ridge of hills running east to west bisected the island, with a series of lower entrances that were all guarded by Continentals except inexplicably to the farthest east at Jamaica), catching the Patriots off-guard and routing the Americans from their forward positions back into the entrenchments on Brooklyn Heights. [...] Despite the urging of Clinton and others, Howe decided against an immediate assault on these fortifications, claiming [...] "the Troops had for that day done handsomely enough." [...] He instead began siege operations, methodically advancing on the entrenched Americans. This decision allowed General Washington to successfully orchestrate a nighttime strategic withdrawal across the East River on the night of 29–30 August, aided by a thick morning fog. Historian George Bilias notes that had Howe attacked Brooklyn Heights, the capture of even half of Washington's army, and possibly Washington himself, might have had a significant effect on the rebellion. Some officers, notably General Clinton, were critical of Howe's decision not to storm the American works. Howe was knighted as a reward for his victory on Long Island.|$|E
