2500|$|Stacking is {{the second}} game, {{following}} Costume Quest, to come from Double Fine that was initially created during an [...] "Amnesia Fortnight" [...] event during Brütal Legends development period. Tim Schafer had used the Fortnight during a time where the fate of Brütal Legends publication was unclear, dividing the company into four teams to prototype smaller games. The game's creator and project lead is Lee Petty, {{who had been the}} art director for Brütal Legend. Petty had wanted to create a contemporary adventure game, maintaining the characters and stories while reinventing the normal point-and-click interface used for such games. After observing his daughter playing with matryoshka dolls, he realized that the dolls themselves could be the characters, the inventory, and the action verbs at the same time. Petty and Schafer later reflected that the use of dolls, a common toy, would help to make the game appealing to the casual player, as they would quickly understand the mechanics of stacking and <b>unstacking,</b> while still having an allure for hardcore players with deeper gameplay mechanics. The idea of using these dolls would later be of benefit in production, as the basic structure of the doll model in the game's engine could easily be reused for the more than one hundred unique dolls within the game. Schafer assisted in helping Petty to write the game's story and to design some of the puzzles. Schafer estimated the total budget for the game at $2 million.|$|E

5000|$|Features {{like the}} <b>unstacking</b> {{of cities and}} city districts lead {{directly}} to support this approach, since some districts and city improvements depend specifically on what available terrain is nearby. Such changes were also the result of design choices made by Civilization Vs lead designer Jon Schafer during its development, such as the <b>unstacking</b> of player units. These changes in Civilization V exposed other weak areas of the core gameplay of the series, specifically how cities were simply seen as places to dump improvements and Wonders with {{little effect on the}} map, according to producer Dennis Shirk.|$|E
50|$|Internal-loops (also termed {{interior}} loops) in RNA {{are found}} where the double stranded RNA separates due to no Watson-Crick base pairing between the nucleotides. Internal-loops differ from Stem-loops as they occur in {{middle of a}} stretch of double stranded RNA.

50|$|Binding of {{the enzyme}} induces a {{conformational}} {{change in the}} DNA, bending it by about 50°. DNA bending results in the <b>unstacking</b> of the bases, widening of the minor groove, and compression of the major groove.

5000|$|As voltage is applied, the anions (and {{negatively}} charged sample molecules) migrate toward the positive electrode (anode) {{in the lower}} chamber, the leading ion is Cl− ( [...] high mobility and high concentration); glycinate is the trailing ion (low mobility and low concentration). SDS-protein particles do not migrate freely at {{the border between the}} Cl− of the gel buffer and the Gly− of the cathode buffer. Friedrich Kohlrausch found that Ohm's law also applies to dissolved electrolytes. Because of the voltage drop between the Cl− and Glycine-buffers, proteins are compressed (stacked) into micrometer thin layers. [...] The boundary moves through a pore gradient and the protein stack gradually disperses due to a frictional resistance increase of the gel matrix. Stacking and <b>unstacking</b> occurs continuously in the gradient gel, for every protein at a different position. For a complete protein <b>unstacking</b> the polyacrylamide-gel concentration must exceed 16% T. The two-gel system of [...] "Laemmli" [...] is a simple gradient gel. The pH discontinuity of the buffers is of no significance for the separation quality, and a [...] "stacking-gel" [...] with a different pH is not needed.|$|E
5000|$|Heat {{denaturation}} of DNA, {{also called}} [...] melting, causes the double helix structure to unwind to form single stranded DNA. When DNA in solution is heated above its melting temperature (usually more than 80 °C), the double-stranded DNA unwinds to form single-stranded DNA. The bases become <b>unstacked</b> and can thus absorb more light. In their native state, {{the bases of}} DNA absorb light in the 260-nm wavelength region. When the bases become <b>unstacked,</b> the wavelength of maximum absorbance does not change, but the amount absorbed increases by 37%. A double strand DNA dissociating to single strands produces a sharp cooperative transition.|$|R

40|$|Freeze-fracture {{replicas of}} the {{photosynthetic}} prokaryote Prochloron sp., collected at Coconut Island, Hawaii, show that the thylakoids are differentiated into stacked and <b>unstacked</b> regions much like the thylakoids of green algae and higher plants. On the exoplasmic (E) fracture face, the particle density is greater in stacked regions (≈ 3100 particles/μm 2) than in <b>unstacked</b> regions (≈ 925 particles/μm 2). On the complementary protoplasmic (P) fracture face, the particle density is lower in stacked regions (≈ 2265 particles/μm 2 than in <b>unstacked</b> regions (≈ 4980 particles/μm 2). The histogram of the diameters of E face particles in <b>unstacked</b> regions shows a single broad peak centered at 80 Å. In stacked regions, four distinct peaks, at 75, 105, 130, and 160 Å, are observed. These size classes are virtually identical to those found on E faces of thylakoids of the green alga Chlamydomonas and of greening pea chloroplasts. In the latter systems, the different size classes of E face particles are believed to represent photosystem II units surrounded by variable amounts of chlorophyll a/b light-harvesting complex. We propose that the same interpretation applies to the thylakoids of Prochloron, which contain a similar chlorophyll a/b complex. Our results add to the evidence supporting {{the view of the}} chlorophyll a/b complex as both a light-harvesting complex and a membrane adhesion factor. The similarity of the architecture of the thylakoids of Prochloron to that of green algal and plant chloroplasts also provides additional evidence of an evolutionary relationship between Prochloron and the chloroplasts of green plants...|$|R

5000|$|Since {{the call}} stack is {{organized}} as a stack, the caller pushes the return address onto the stack, and the called subroutine, when it finishes, pulls or pops the return address off the call stack and transfers control to that address. If a called subroutine calls {{on yet another}} subroutine, it will push another return address onto the call stack, and so on, with the information stacking up and <b>unstacking</b> as the program dictates. If the pushing consumes all of the space allocated for the call stack, an error called a stack overflow occurs, generally causing the program to crash. Adding a subroutine's entry to the call stack is sometimes called [...] "winding"; conversely, removing entries is [...] "unwinding".|$|E
5000|$|A pallet {{inverter}} or {{pile turner}} is {{a machine that}} is used to turn over pallets whilst still loaded with products. The reasons for needing to turn over a pallet are varied, but one main reason is the need to replace a broken or inappropriate pallet without <b>unstacking</b> the whole load. Sometimes a manufacturer simply needs to turn their products to stop their contents settling. In some industries, it is necessary to transfer goods from one type of pallet to another [...] - [...] for example, when plastic pallets are used for on-site storage and wooden pallets are used for shipping. Pallet inverters can be built into production lines or be used as a stand-alone product.

40|$|Wild-type {{chloroplast}} membranes from Chlamydomonas reinhardi exhibit four {{faces in}} freeze-etchreplicas: the complementary Bs and Cs faces are found where the membranes are stacked together; the complementary Bu and Cu faces {{are found in}} <b>unstacked</b> membranes. The Bs face carries a dense population of regularly spaced particles containing the large, 160 ± 10 A particles {{that appear to be}} unique to chloroplast membranes. Under certain growth conditions, membrane stacking does not occur in the ac- 5 strain. When isolated, these membranes remain <b>unstacked,</b> exhibit only Bu and Cu faces, and retain the ability to carry out normal photosynthesis. Membrane stacking is also absent in the ac- 31 strain, and, when isolated in a low-salt medium, these membranes remain <b>unstacked</b> and exhibit only Bu and Cu faces. When isolated in a high-salt medium, however, they stack normally, and Bs and Cs faces are produced by this in vitro stacking process. We conclude that certain particle distributions in the chloroplast membrane are created {{as a consequence of the}} stacking process, and that the ability of membranes to stack can be modified both by gene mutation and by the ionic environment in which the membranes are found...|$|R

5000|$|In flashback, Niall (Thomas Nelstrop), a {{local news}} reporter, recalls visiting his mother's grave, as he smartens up in a toilet mirror. His {{colleague}} Tammy (Sally Bretton) {{knocks on the}} toilet door to hurry him up and as they walk to the car she instructs him {{on the art of}} the 'death-knock': knocking on the doors of the recently bereaved to obtain quotes and pictures of the deceased for the newspaper. Niall's poor track record has put his job on the line and Tammy has been detailed to improve his hit-rate. When they reach the house of Mrs Wright, who has lost her son in a car accident, Niall goes in first while Tammy waits outside. Before Niall can introduce himself and launch into his spiel that Tammy has prepared for him, Mrs Wright (April Nicholson) interrupts him - [...] "I know who you are" [...] - and ushers him into the house. There she ropes him into <b>unstacking</b> the dishwasher as Niall tries in vain to broach the subject of the bereavement against the sound of a fire alarm which has been set off by the cigarette Mrs Wright is smoking. Mrs Wright appears baffled by Niall's requests for pictures and instead offers him some soup telling him they will look at some pictures [...] "in the morning", much to Niall's surprise. She then leads him upstairs to the bedroom and encourages him to get some rest. Trapped in the bedroom, Niall examines the dead boy's belongings and finds himself playing with his toys. Meanwhile, Tammy waits outside taking a phone call from her boss at the newspaper, to whom she explains that Niall [...] "is still in there, so he must be doing alright". Whilst playing with a light sabre, Niall knocks off a shelf-load of items and as he picks them up, he finds a photo of the dead boy. Mrs Wright, alerted by the noise, appears behind him and embracing Niall, she tells him: [...] "it's been a long day: time for bed." [...] Tammy knocks at the door and attempts to talk to Mrs Wright about the accident in which her son was killed, but Mrs Wright replies that her son is in his room and that there must be some mistake. Closing the door, she is nonetheless shaken by Tammy's insistence that her son is dead and she climbs the stairs to the bedroom where she finds Niall tucked up fast asleep in her son's bed. She kisses him on the cheek and switches out the light.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Base <b>unstacking</b> in {{template}} strands, when {{accompanied by}} strand slippage, {{can result in}} deletion mutations during strand extension by nucleic acid polymerases. In a GCCC mutation hot-spot sequence, which was previously identified to have a 50 % probability of causing such mutations during DNA replication by a Y-family polymerase, a single-base deletion mutation could result from such <b>unstacking</b> of any one of its three template cytosines. In this study, the intrinsic energetic differences in <b>unstacking</b> among these three cytosines in a solvated DNA duplex overhang model were examined using umbrella sampling molecular dynamics simulations. The free energy profiles obtained show that cytosine <b>unstacking</b> grows progressively more unfavorable as one moves inside the duplex from the 5 ′-end of the overhang template strand. Spontaneous strand slippage occurs in response to such base <b>unstacking</b> {{in the direction of}} both the major and minor grooves for all three cytosines. Unrestrained simulations run from three distinct strand-slipped states and one non-strand-slipped state suggest that a more duplexlike environment can help stabilize strand slippage. The possible underlying reasons an...|$|E

40|$|Photosystem II is {{vulnerable}} to light damage. The reaction center-binding D 1 protein is impaired during excessive illumination and is degraded and removed from photosystem II. Using isolated spinach thylakoids, we investigated the relationship between light-induced <b>unstacking</b> of thylakoids and damage to the D 1 protein. Under light stress, thylakoids were expected to become unstacked so that the photodamaged photosystem II complexes in the grana and the proteases could move on the thylakoids for repair. Excessive light induced irreversible <b>unstacking</b> of thylakoids. By comparing the effects of light stress on stacked and unstacked thylakoids, photoinhibition of photosystem II {{was found to be}} more prominent in stacked thylakoids than in unstacked thylakoids. In accordance with this finding, EPR spin trapping measurements demonstrated higher production of hydroxyl radicals in stacked thylakoids than in unstacked thylakoids.

5|$|Holliday {{junctions}} {{may exist}} {{in a variety of}} conformational isomers with different patterns of coaxial stacking between the four double-helical arms. Coaxial stacking is the tendency of nucleic acid blunt ends to bind to each other, by interactions between the exposed bases. There are three possible stacking conformers: an <b>unstacked</b> form and two stacked forms. The <b>unstacked</b> form dominates in the absence of divalent cations such as Mg2+, because of electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged backbones of the strands. In the presence of at least about 0.1 mM Mg2+, the electrostatic repulsion is counteracted and the stacked structures predominate. As of 2000, it was not known with certainty whether the electrostatic shielding was the result of site-specific binding of cations to the junction, or the presence of a diffuse collection of the ions in solution.|$|R

The rate of branch migration varies dramatically with ion concentration, with single-step times increasing from 0.3−0.4 ms with no ions to 270−300 ms with 10 mM Mg2+.
