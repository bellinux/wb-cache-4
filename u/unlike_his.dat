5|$|Jefferson {{recorded}} slave births in his Farm Book. <b>Unlike</b> <b>his</b> {{practice in}} recording births of other slaves, {{he did not}} note the father of Hemings' children.|$|E
5|$|Michael Hui (許冠文) as The Landlord (包租公): The mentor of Thongs and Octopus {{for over}} 20 years. <b>Unlike</b> <b>his</b> trainees, the Landlord does not spend {{his share of}} the loot, instead stashing it in a safe in his home.|$|E
5|$|Tusshar Kapoor as Ramakanth, Suryakant's {{brother and}} a writer {{for one of his}} {{forthcoming}} films. He is attracted to Silk but, <b>unlike</b> <b>his</b> brother, is empathetic towards her.|$|E
60|$|Louis {{interrupted}} me; it was <b>unlike</b> him. <b>His</b> little gesture {{showed that}} he was very nearly angry.|$|R
50|$|<b>Unlike</b> in <b>his</b> later collaborations, Seghers is {{believed}} to have added flower garlands to existing paintings by Domenichino during his residence in Rome.|$|R
60|$|Daylight {{was now the}} centre. The {{kerosene}} lamps above flung high {{lights from}} the rash of sweat on his forehead. The bronze of his cheeks was darkened by the accession of blood. His black eyes glittered, and his nostrils were distended and eager. They were large nostrils, tokening his descent from savage ancestors who had survived by virtue of deep lungs and generous air-passages. Yet, <b>unlike</b> MacDonald, <b>his</b> voice was firm and customary, and, <b>unlike</b> Kearns, <b>his</b> hand did not tremble when he wrote.|$|R
5|$|<b>Unlike</b> <b>his</b> contemporaries Ferdinand Tönnies and Max Weber, {{he focused}} not on what motivates {{the actions of}} {{individuals}} (an approach associated with methodological individualism), but rather {{on the study of}} social facts.|$|E
5|$|Albert Victor's brother, Prince George, Duke of York, now {{second in}} line to the throne, evidently became close to May during their shared period of mourning, and Queen Victoria still favoured May as a {{suitable}} candidate to marry a future king. In May 1893, George proposed, and May accepted. They were soon deeply in love, and their marriage was a success. George wrote to May every day they were apart and, <b>unlike</b> <b>his</b> father, never took a mistress.|$|E
5|$|Alexander was erudite and patronized both {{arts and}} sciences. However, {{he had little}} {{interest}} in sports or the Olympic games (<b>unlike</b> <b>his</b> father), seeking only the Homeric ideals of honour (timê) and glory (kudos). He had great charisma and force of personality, characteristics which made him a great leader. His unique abilities were further demonstrated by the inability of any of his generals to unite Macedonia and retain the Empire after his death—only Alexander had the ability to do so.|$|E
50|$|<b>Unlike</b> Estrada, <b>his</b> {{running mate}} in 2013, three-term {{incumbent}} vice mayor Isko Moreno is term limited as he served for three consecutive terms. He {{is running for}} the Senate.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Unlike</b> of <b>his</b> {{previous}} compilation album Grandes Éxitos, {{this album}} {{is a collection}} of Chayanne ballads with a new song [...] "Contra Vientos y Mareas" [...] by Franco De Vita.|$|R
50|$|Pulse Demon is {{an album}} by the Japanese noise {{musician}} Merzbow. <b>Unlike</b> Venereology, <b>his</b> previous album for Release, this album is not inspired by heavy metal. Outtakes from this album are included on Merzmorphosis.|$|R
5|$|At {{the base}} of the rank pyramid were the common soldiers: pedes (infantryman) and eques (cavalryman). <b>Unlike</b> <b>his</b> 2nd-century counterpart, the 4th-century soldier's food and {{equipment}} was not deducted from his salary (stipendium), but was provided free. This is because the stipendium, paid in debased silver denarii, was under Diocletian worth far less than in the 2nd century. It lost its residual value under Constantine and ceased to be paid regularly in mid-4th century.|$|E
5|$|Emperor Xingzong died in 1055. His eldest son, Yelü Hongji (who {{would later}} be known by the name Emperor Daozong of Liao), assumed the throne having already gained {{experience}} in governing while his father was alive. <b>Unlike</b> <b>his</b> father, Emperor Daozong did not face a succession crisis. While both Ji Dian and Zhong Yuan remained alive, and both had the political influence {{to interfere with the}} succession process, neither did.|$|E
5|$|Garamond is {{the name}} of a {{character}} in the Wii game Super Paper Mario. He appears in the world of Flopside (the mirror-image of Flipside, where the game begins). He is a prolific and highly successful author, <b>unlike</b> <b>his</b> Flipside counterpart, Helvetica (a probable recognition of the relative suitability of the two fonts for use in book typesetting).|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{made into}} a poem at last, such a pretty one," [...] said Babie. [...] "And {{he says he will}} be wiser all his life for finding things turn out so <b>unlike</b> all <b>his</b> expectations." ...|$|R
50|$|However, <b>unlike</b> many of <b>his</b> {{contemporary}} officers, Nogi expressed {{no interest}} in pursuing politics.|$|R
50|$|<b>Unlike</b> some of <b>his</b> other albums, {{the album}} had more kid-friendly humor on it.|$|R
5|$|Gavaskar {{made his}} One Day International (ODI) debut against England at Headingley in 1974. <b>Unlike</b> <b>his</b> Test career, his ODI career was less illustrious scoring 3,092 runs {{at an average}} of 35.13. Gavaskar's solitary century in ODIs came in the {{penultimate}} innings of his career—against New Zealand—during the 1987 Cricket World Cup where he scored 103 runs in 88 balls; the performance ensured India's victory, which earned him a man of the match award.|$|E
5|$|Henry was Catherine's {{favourite}} son. <b>Unlike</b> <b>his</b> brothers, {{he came to}} {{the throne}} as a grown man. He was also healthier, though he suffered from weak lungs and constant fatigue. His interest in the tasks of government, however, proved fitful. He depended on Catherine and her team of secretaries until the last few weeks of her life. He often hid from state affairs, immersing himself in acts of piety, such as pilgrimages and flagellation.|$|E
5|$|Hoffman {{paid for}} his middle nephew's {{business}} classes at the Academy of Commerce until his 1912 graduation, and arranged his hiring by the stock exchange soon after. <b>Unlike</b> <b>his</b> older brother Imre, {{who worked at the}} exchange in Budapest for all his life, Kertész had little interest in the field. He was drawn to illustrated magazines and to activities like fishing and swimming in the Danube River near his uncle's property.|$|E
60|$|Juliette, awed, terrified, {{was gazing}} {{at her father}} with great, {{wondering}} eyes. He seemed <b>unlike</b> himself. <b>His</b> face wore a curious expression of ecstasy and of hatred, also of hope and exultation, whenever he looked steadily at her.|$|R
5000|$|Margaret, Boden's wife, often {{contributed to}} his portraits, with their efforts having been {{described}} as [...] "a joint operation". Boden was upset that, <b>unlike</b> him, <b>his</b> wife was never elected {{a member of the}} Royal Society of Portrait Painters.|$|R
25|$|After {{the end of}} his Worcestershire career, Bent played minor {{counties}} cricket for Herefordshire in 1992, and <b>unlike</b> in <b>his</b> first-class days proved quite {{effective as}} a bowler, taking three or four wickets in an innings on a number of occasions.|$|R
5|$|In 1758, Johnson {{began to}} write a weekly series, The Idler, which ran from 15 April 1758 to 5 April 1760, {{as a way to}} avoid {{finishing}} his Shakespeare. This series was shorter and lacked many features of The Rambler. <b>Unlike</b> <b>his</b> independent publication of The Rambler, The Idler was published in a weekly news journal The Universal Chronicle, a publication supported by John Payne, John Newbery, Robert Stevens and William Faden.|$|E
5|$|Lützow {{graduated}} with his Abitur (university-preparatory high school diploma) on 31 March 1931 from the Schulpforta, {{a boarding school}} for academically gifted students. <b>Unlike</b> <b>his</b> brothers, who both pursued a naval career, Lützow joined the Reichswehr (Army of the Weimar Republic) following his graduation from school. This decision had been influenced by his mother's youngest brother, Eberhard Kinzel, at the time {{an officer in the}} Reichswehr and later General der Infanterie (General of the Infantry) in the Heer (German Army).|$|E
5|$|Paper Trail is {{the sixth}} studio album by American hip hop {{recording}} artist T.I., released September 30, 2008, on Grand Hustle Records and Atlantic Records. He {{began to write}} songs for the album as he awaited trial for federal weapons and possession charges. <b>Unlike</b> <b>his</b> past albums, he wrote his lyrics down on paper, which he had not done since his debut album, I'm Serious (2001).|$|E
50|$|<b>Unlike</b> many of <b>his</b> comrades, Abu Ibrahim {{survived the}} revolt and was {{reportedly}} alive as of 1972.|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, he {{generally}} sets out his moral anecdotes {{in chronological order}} (<b>unlike,</b> say, <b>his</b> Roman contemporary Suetonius) and is rarely narrow-minded and unrealistic, almost always prepared to acknowledge {{the complexity of the}} human condition where moralising cannot explain it.|$|R
50|$|The symphony is scored {{for a large}} {{orchestra}} {{consisting of}} approximately 100 musicians. <b>Unlike</b> in <b>his</b> later symphonies, Mahler does not use the entire ensemble in every movement. Several instruments {{are used in the}} last movement only, especially in the woodwinds and brass.|$|R
5|$|Scholars {{have long}} speculated about the {{influence}} – if any – of Hamnet's death upon William Shakespeare's writing. <b>Unlike</b> <b>his</b> contemporary Ben Jonson, who wrote a lengthy piece {{on the death of}} his own son, Shakespeare, if he wrote anything in response, did so more subtly. At the time his son died, Shakespeare was writing primarily comedies, and that writing continued until a few years after Hamnet's death, when his major tragedies were written. It is possible that his tragedies gained depth from his experience.|$|E
5|$|That same year, he {{illustrated}} the pro-occupation book Zóó zag Brussel de Dietsche Militanten under the pen name Kaproen. In the 1970s Willy denied rumors, based on drawing style, {{that he had}} been the real artist behind Kaproen, but in 2010 these allegations were confirmed after an investigation demanded by his own family. <b>Unlike</b> <b>his</b> partners, Vandersteen was later not persecuted for his part in publishing the antisemitic drawings, which were considered collaboration with the Nazis.|$|E
5|$|The King's {{body was}} taken to Athens on the Amphitrite, escorted by a {{flotilla}} of naval vessels. For three days the coffin of the King, draped in the Danish and Greek flags, lay in the Metropolitan Cathedral in Athens before his body was committed to a tomb at his palace in Tatoi. <b>Unlike</b> <b>his</b> father, the new king, Constantine, was to prove less {{willing to accept the}} advice of ministers, or that of the three protecting powers (Britain, France and Russia).|$|E
5000|$|Volpone - One of {{the oldest}} foxes in the forest and Voracious' father. Is {{occasionally}} left with the unpopular task of babysitting Ghengis. Like Voracious, he looks {{different from the other}} foxes. Though <b>unlike</b> him, <b>his</b> appearance is of a brown coyote.|$|R
50|$|At {{first he}} {{exhibited}} {{as a guest}} with the Tvrdošíjni group of painters, and later had several solo shows and even exhibited {{his work at the}} des Artistes Indépendants Salon des indépendants in Paris, where <b>unlike</b> in <b>his</b> native country it was a great success.|$|R
5000|$|La Tour is {{best known}} for the nocturnal light effects which he {{developed}} much further than his artistic predecessors had done, and transferred their use in the genre subjects in the paintings of the Dutch Caravaggisti to religious painting in <b>his.</b> <b>Unlike</b> Caravaggio <b>his</b> religious paintings lack dramatic effects. He painted these in a second phase of his style, perhaps beginning in the 1640s, using chiaroscuro, careful geometrical compositions, and very simplified painting of forms. His work moves during his career towards greater simplicity and stillness—taking from Caravaggio very different qualities than Jusepe de Ribera and his Tenebrist followers did.|$|R
