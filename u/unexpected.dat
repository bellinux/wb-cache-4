5|$|THSRC has {{established}} a system to respond to natural disasters and <b>unexpected</b> intrusion onto the right-of-way, called DWS (Disaster Warning Systems). This system consists {{of a network of}} sensors installed along the rail route to detect <b>unexpected</b> situations such as earthquakes, strong winds, heavy rainfall, floods, landslides, and intrusions. In case of an <b>unexpected</b> situation, the DWS will send signals to the OCC (Operation Control Center) immediately; it will also activate contingency measures {{to ensure the safety of}} the passengers and trains, including decelerating or stopping trains in the affected area.|$|E
5|$|Valiente had {{a strong}} dislike of <b>unexpected</b> visitors, and would often refuse to answer the door to those who knocked unannounced.|$|E
5|$|With iOS 10.2.1, Apple made {{improvements}} to reduce occurrences of <b>unexpected</b> shutdowns {{that a small}} number of users were experiencing with their iPhone. iOS 10.2.1 already has over 50% of active iOS devices upgraded and the diagnostic data we've received from upgraders shows that for this small percentage of users experiencing the issue, we're seeing a more than 80% reduction in iPhone 6s and over 70% reduction on iPhone 6 of devices unexpectedly shutting down. We also added the ability for the phone to restart without needing to connect to power, if a user still encounters an <b>unexpected</b> shutdown. It {{is important to note that}} these <b>unexpected</b> shutdowns are not a safety issue, but we understand it can be an inconvenience and wanted to fix the issue as quickly as possible. If a customer has any issues with their device they can contact AppleCare.|$|E
5|$|Adrenal {{tumors are}} {{commonly}} found as incidentalomas, <b>unexpected</b> asymptomatic tumors found during medical imaging. They {{are seen in}} around 3.4% of CT scans, {{and in most cases}} they are benign adenomas. Adrenal carcinomas are very rare, with an incidence of 1 case per million per year.|$|E
5|$|Advanced {{methods of}} loading were not {{foreseen}} when the ships were designed. While the new processes are more efficient, loading {{is more difficult}} to control (it can take over an hour just to halt the operation), occasionally resulting in overloading the ship.

5|$|Although Kirchner {{was known}} to have health problems, his death was <b>unexpected,</b> and had {{a great impact on}} the {{politics}} of Argentina. Kirchner died at an early age, while still being a highly influential figure in politics, despite not being president at the time. Presidents Manuel Quintana, Roque Sáenz Peña and Roberto María Ortiz died in office, but none of them had a political clout comparable to that of Kirchner. President Juan Perón had a similar power and died in office, but his death was not <b>unexpected,</b> as he had already reached the life expectancy of the time. Other figures of the history of Argentina who achieved great political clout, such as José de San Martín, Juan Manuel de Rosas, Julio Argentino Roca, Carlos Pellegrini and Hipólito Yrigoyen, all died when they were already retired from politics, or even abroad.|$|E
5|$|An <b>unexpected</b> {{adverse effect}} of {{daylight}} saving time {{may lie in the}} fact that an extra part of morning rush hour traffic occurs before dawn and traffic emissions then cause higher air pollution than during daylight hours.|$|E
5|$|An <b>unexpected</b> {{bonus of}} the Bruneval raid was the Germans' {{efforts to improve}} defences at Würzburg {{stations}} and prevent similar attacks. The radars were surrounded by rings of barbed wire which increased their visibility from the air, making them easier to target prior to Operation Overlord.|$|E
5|$|Despite the <b>unexpected</b> {{failure of}} Thunderbirds Are Go on its release in December 1966, the United Artists {{distributors}} authorised a sequel, to be budgeted at £300,000.

5|$|The verb {{systems and}} pronouns {{recorded}} by Baudrimont is peculiar in several ways. Apart from his problem of eliciting the citation form of verbs {{as opposed to}} participles, he lists pronouns and possessive pronouns that appear to contain Romani roots and an <b>unexpected</b> auxiliary.|$|E
5|$|There is, however, {{one notable}} exception. In most implementations, COALESCE evaluates its {{parameters}} {{until it reaches}} the first non-NULL one, while NVL evaluates all of its parameters. This is important for several reasons. A parameter after the first non-NULL parameter could be a function, which could either be computationally expensive, invalid, or could create <b>unexpected</b> side effects.|$|E
