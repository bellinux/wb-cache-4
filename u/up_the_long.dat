5|$|The Lerwick Up Helly Aa is one {{of several}} fire festivals held in Shetland {{annually}} in the middle of winter -- it is always started on the last Tuesday of January. The festival is just over 100 years old in its present, highly organised form. Originally, a festival held to break <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> nights of winter and mark the end of Yule, the festival has become one celebrating the isles' heritage and includes a procession of men dressed as Vikings and the burning of a replica longship.|$|E
5|$|Three stars make <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> narrow {{triangle}} {{that gives}} the constellation its name. The brightest member is the white giant star Beta Trianguli of apparent magnitude 3.00, lying 127 light-years distant from Earth. It is actually a spectroscopic binary system; the primary is a white star of spectral type A5IV with 3.5 times the mass of our sun that is beginning to expand and evolve off the main sequence. The secondary is poorly known, but calculated to be a yellow-white F-type main-sequence star around 1.4 solar masses. The two orbit around a common centre of gravity every 31 days, and are surrounded by a ring of dust that extends from 50 to 400AU away from the stars.|$|E

25|$|In {{the days}} before calculators, people would use {{mathematical}} tableslists of numbers showing the results of calculation with varying argumentsto simplify and speed up computation. Tables of logarithms and trigonometric functions were common {{in math and science}} textbooks. Specialized tables were published for applications such as astronomy, celestial navigation and statistics. Methods of numerical approximation existed, called prosthaphaeresis, that offered shortcuts around time-consuming operations such as multiplication and taking powers and roots. Astronomers, especially, were concerned with methods that could speed <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> series of computations involved in celestial mechanics calculations.|$|E
25|$|Krabi Krabong or Combat with Short and Long Sticks {{and with}} Swords These dances are {{inspired}} by types of combat that were typical of Thailand, in which either sticks or swords are used. The skillful use of the short stick depends on the agility of the fighter, who must attack and always remain close to his opponent, while the combatant who takes <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> stick must maintain a critical distance from his rival to use his weapon effectively. The art of sword fighting has been practiced in Thailand {{since the beginning of}} time, and, traditionally, a ceremonial dance is performed prior to combat.|$|E

25|$|Her track career faltered {{early in}} 1994 from severe leg injury but Coaches Timothy and Lawrence Athill coached her {{back onto the}} track. Later that year she began working as the Director of Academic Advisement at the University of Albany. However, she again took <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> jump in {{seriousness}} the following year, moving to Eugene, Oregon to work {{under the tutelage of}} Elżbieta Krzesińska – a Polish Olympic champion and former world record holder in the event. Williams came second in the long jump behind Jackie Joyner-Kersee at the 1995 USA Indoor Track and Field Championships and thus qualified for the 1995 IAAF World Indoor Championships. In her first major international appearance, she came fourth in her qualifier but did not reach the final. She greatly improved the following year, winning the US Indoor title with a best of 6.79m and then improving this further to 7.01m at the US Olympic Track Trials. She was runner-up at the trials to Joyner-Kersee but as a top three finisher she gained automatic qualification into the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. On her Olympic debut on home soil she failed to record a mark, fouling three times, and was eliminated from the competition.|$|E
500|$|After enclosure, [...] "civilisation {{came to the}} Fell". This {{began with}} the {{building}} of a new road. The only major road through Gateshead Fell was that which followed the same route of the ancient turnpike road which ran through what is now Sheriff Hill (today this is Old Durham Road/Sheriffs Highway). The turnpike road was very steep and was deemed rather unsatisfactory:Why should coaches have to labour <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> hill from Newcastle to the top of Gateshead Fell, and then go down the steep descent to the Coach & Horses inn just before Birtley, while those coming from the south had to climb and descend the hills in reverse?

500|$|Based {{in a large}} farmhouse, the Cwm {{included}} two houses, called [...] "Upper Cwm" [...] and [...] "Lower Cwm". They were divided by a walled forecourt and during their prime each was able to generate £60 (equivalent to £ in [...] ) annually in rents from its own land. At one time, Cwm had a library, and some 150 volumes were confiscated and removed to Hereford Cathedral Library. The original buildings were mostly demolished in 1830 and the existing structure dates from soon afterwards, is {{on the site of}} the now demolished 17th-century house that held the Jesuit college and incorporates part of it. Enough remains of the original house half-way <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> range of hills which slope down to the Monnow to trace the life led by its Jesuit inmates in the penal times. Originally a shooting box, and subsequently a farmhouse, it is Grade II listed, together with the terrace in front of the house, and the retaining wall to the side, which contains rare bee boles. There is a wood in the area known as Cwm Wood today.|$|E

5000|$|Importantly for {{the story}} of Square No. 15, L'Enfant feared that <b>the</b> <b>longest</b> avenues, {{especially}} Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, would challenge elements of his design strategy, and therefore he created small angles at the larger intersections to break <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>longest</b> avenues. Among <b>the</b> most dramatic changes to the map, Rhode Island Avenue no longer crossed through Square No. 15 at the perfect angle that {{it had in the}} L'Enfant plan, and as such was eliminated from Washington, DC.|$|R

He rolled over into a dive, leveled off a few feet above the track and flew head-on towards the train as the engineer repeatedly sounded the whistle. At the last moment Mantz pulled up, did a [...] "victory roll" [...] and flew away. This sort of dangerous stunt was fairly common during the early era of loosely regulated flying in the 1920s but the train's passengers included ranking officers coming to March Field {{to participate in the}} graduation ceremonies and Mantz was subsequently dismissed from the army.

2500|$|SBVT {{also points}} to the {{narration}} of a subsequent event in Tour of Duty (pp.188–189).

[...] He goes on to quote Kerry's reflections in his notebook: [...] "A cocky feeling of invincibility accompanied us <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>Long</b> Tau shipping channel because we hadn't been shot at yet, and Americans at war who haven't been shot at are allowed to be cocky." [...] SBVT argues that this journal entry shows that the December 2 incident could not have involved enemy fire. Others argue that Kerry was referring to ambushes, a common misfortune for Swift Boats which Kerry had not yet suffered, or to the crew collectively, as he used the term [...] "we" [...] instead of [...] "I", {{and most of his}} crewmembers clearly had been [...] "shot at" [...] before.|$|E
