40|$|Previous {{studies of}} music fan culture have largely {{centered}} on the diverse range of subcultures devoted to particular genres, groups, and stars. Where studies have moved beyond the actual music and examined the fashion, concerts, and collecting ephemera such as vinyl records and posters, they have tended to remain closely allied to notions of subcultural distinction, emphasizing hierarchies of taste. This paper shifts the focus in music fan studies beyond the appreciation {{of the music and}} discusses the popular fan practice of collecting souvenir pins produced and sold by the Hard Rock Café (HRC) within a framework of fan tourism. Traveling to and collecting <b>unique</b> <b>pins</b> from locations across the globe creates a fan dialogue that centers on tourism and the collecting practices associated with souvenir consumption. Collectors engage in practices such as blogging, travel writing, and administration that become important indicators of their particular expression of fandom: pin collecting. Membership requires both time and money; recording visits around the world and collecting <b>unique</b> <b>pins</b> from every café builds fans' cultural capital. This indicates an internationalization of popular fandom, with the Internet acting as a connective virtual space between local and national, personal and public physical space. The study of HRC pin collecting and its fan community suggests that HRC enthusiasts are not so because they enjoy rock music or follow any particular artist but due to the physical ephemera that they collect and the places and spaces they visit...|$|R

Arbitrary dislocations, parameterized by the homotopy group of the D-torus, are injected as initial conditions and quantitatively followed as the equation evolves in real time. We show that for strong diffusion the results for dislocation climb velocity are similar for the dodecagonal and the hexagonal patterns, but that for weak diffusion the dodecagonal pattern exhibits a <b>unique</b> <b>pinning</b> of the dislocation reflecting its quasiperiodic structure. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a Josephson junction system installed with a finite length inhomogeneity, either of micro-resistor or micro-resonator type. The {{system can be}} modelled by a sine-Gordon equation with a piecewise-constant function to represent the varying Josephson tunneling critical current. The existence of pinned fluxons depends {{on the length of}} the inhomogeneity, the variation in the Josephson tunneling critical current and the applied bias current. We establish that a system may either not be able to sustain a pinned fluxon, or - for instance by varying the length of the inhomogeneity - may exhibit various different types of pinned fluxons. Our stability analysis shows that changes of stability can only occur at critical points of the length of the inhomogeneity {{as a function of the}} (Hamiltonian) energy density inside the inhomogeneity - a relation we determine explicitly. In combination with continuation arguments and Sturm-Liouville theory, we determine the stability of all constructed pinned fluxons. It follows that if a given system is able to sustain at least one pinned fluxon, a microresistor has exactly one pinned fluxon, i. e. the system selects one <b>unique</b> <b>pinned</b> stable pinned configuration, and a microresonator has at least one stable pinned configuration. Moreover, it is shown that both for micro-resistors and micro-resonators this stable pinned configuration may be non-monotonic - something which is not possible in the homogeneous case. Finally, it is shown that results in the literature on localised inhomogeneities can be recovered as limits of our results on micro-resonators. © 2011 Cambridge University Press...|$|R

50|$|Because only {{a single}} set of LEDs, all having a common anode or cathode, can be lit {{simultaneously}} without turning on unintended LEDs, Charlieplexing requires frequent output changes, through a method known as flickering. When flickering is done, not all LEDs are lit quite simultaneously, but rather one set of LEDs is lit briefly, then another set, then another, and eventually the cycle repeats. If it is done fast enough, they will appear to all be on, all the time, to the human eye (persistence of vision). In order for a display to not have any noticeable flicker, the refresh rate for each LED must be greater than 50 Hz. Suppose 8 tri-state pins are used to control 56 LEDs through Charlieplexing, which is enough for 8 7-segment displays (without decimal points). Typically 7-segment displays are made to have a common cathode, sometimes a common anode, but {{without loss of generality}} suppose it is a common cathode. All LEDs in all 8 7-segment displays cannot be turned on simultaneously in any desired combination using Charlieplexing. It is impossible to get 56 bits of information directly from 8 trits (the term for a base-3 character, as the pins are 3-state) of information, as 8 trits fundamentally comprises 8 log23, or about 12.7 bits of information, which falls far short of the 56 bits required to turn all 56 LEDs on or off in any arbitrary combination. Instead, the human eye must be fooled by use of a flicker. Only one 7-segment display, one set of 7 LEDs can be active at any time. The way this would be done is for the 8 common cathodes of the 8 displays to each get assigned to its own <b>unique</b> <b>pin</b> among the 8 I/O ports. At any time, one and only one of the 8 controlling I/O pins will be actively low, and thus only the 7-segment display with its common cathode connected to that actively low pin can have any of its LEDs on. That is the active 7-segment display. The anodes of the 7 LED segments within the active 7-segment display can then be turned on in any combination by having the other 7 I/O ports either high or in high-impedance mode, in any combination. They are connected to the remaining 7 pins, but through resistors (the common cathode connection is connected to the pin itself, not through a resistor, because otherwise the current through each individual segment would depend on the number of total segments turned on, as they would all have to share a single resistor). But to show a desired number using all 8 digits, only one 7-segment display can be shown at a time, so all 8 must be cycled through separately, and in a 50th of a second for the entire period of 8. Thus the display must be refreshed at 400 Hz for the period-8 cycle through all 8 segments to make the LEDs flash no slower than 50 times per second. This requires constant interruption of whatever additional processing the controller performs, 400 times per second.|$|E

40|$|In planta {{analysis}} of protein {{function in a}} crop plant could lead to improvements in understanding protein structure/function relationships as well as selective agronomic or end product quality improvements. The requirements for successful in planta analysis are a high mutation rate, an efficient screening method, and a trait with high heritability. Two ideal targets for functional analysis are the Puroindoline a and Puroindoline b (Pina and Pinb, respectively) genes, which together compose the wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) Ha locus that controls grain texture and many wheat end-use properties. Puroindolines (PINs) together impart soft texture, and mutations in either PIN result in hard seed texture. Studies of the PINs' mode of action are limited by low allelic variation. To create new Pin alleles and identify critical function-determining regions, Pin point mutations were created in planta via EMS treatment of a soft wheat. Grain hardness of 46 <b>unique</b> <b>PIN</b> missense alleles was then measured using segregating F 2 :F 3 populations. The impact of individual missense alleles upon PIN function, as measured by grain hardness, ranged from neutral (74 %) to intermediate to function abolishing. The percentage of function-abolishing mutations among mutations occurring in both PINA and PINB was higher for PINB, indicating that PINB is more critical to overall Ha function. This is contrary to expectations in that PINB is not as well conserved as PINA. All function-abolishing mutations resulted from structure-disrupting mutations or from missense mutations occurring near the Tryptophan-rich region. This study demonstrates the feasibility of in planta functional {{analysis of}} wheat proteins and that the Tryptophan-rich region {{is the most important}} region of both PINA and PINB...|$|E
40|$|We {{classify}} elementary particles {{according to}} their behaviour under {{the action of the}} full inhomogeneous Lorentz group. For fundamental fermions, this approach leads us to delineate fermions into eight basic families or `types', corresponding to the eight simply connected double covering groups of the inhomogeneous Lorentz group (the `pin' groups). Given this classification, it is natural to ask whether or not fermion type determines a superselection rule. It is also important to determine what observable effects fermion type might have; for example, can the type of a given fermion be determined by laboratory experiments? We address these questions by arguing that if multiple fermion types really did occur in nature, then it would be mathematically equivalent and also much simpler to think of the different types as being different states of a single particle, which would be a particle which lived in the direct sum of Hilbert spaces associated with the different particle types. In the language of group theory, these are pinor supermultiplets. We discuss the possible experimental ramifications of this proposal. In particular, following work of J. Giesen, we show that the symmetries of the electric dipole moment of a particle would be definitely affected by this proposal. In fact, we show that {{it would be possible to}} use the electric dipole moment of a particle to determine the type.
