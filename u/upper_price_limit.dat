This is because we are going to derive several price limits which refer to different information scenarios with respect to the DM’s preferences, but to the same decision problem. In particular, a price exceeding (falling short of) a lower (<b>upper)</b> <b>price</b> <b>limit</b> is itself a lower (<b>upper)</b> <b>price</b> <b>limit.</b> However, the tighter the price limits, i.e., the smaller the range [π, π], the more useful is the screening stage.|$|E

The trading and DR scenario activate both, the pricing and the DR shifting function. For the upper bound scenario, DR shifting is activated, and pricing is enforced.
