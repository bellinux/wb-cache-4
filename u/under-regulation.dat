[...] Highlighting the example of twelve-year-old Brook Bates, whose 2006 liposuction surgery made national headlines, the film contemplates how the indoctrination of children to perpetuate unhealthy habits will supersede laying the blame on personal accountability.|$|E
50|$|Research {{on whether}} or not {{paternal}} sensitivity has an effect on the security of father-child attachment has produced mixed results. Some studies have shown significant correlations between paternal sensitivity and secure father-child attachments. One study suggests that a father’s sensitivity while playing with his child is as important to the child-father attachment relationship as maternal sensitivity during caregiving is for the child-mother attachment relationship. Furthermore, one study has found that the harm of a father’s frightening behaviours on a child’s future development can be mitigated if the father also has high levels of paternal sensitivity. Having a father who is both insensitive and exhibits frightening behaviours during infancy has been linked to emotional <b>under-regulation</b> at the age of 2 as well as attention problems at the age of 7. However, other studies have failed to find a correlation between paternal sensitivity and infant-father attachment.|$|E

At the same time he bears no responsibility with respect to {{the enterprise}} or its physical property. It has often been said that the owner of a horse is responsible. If the horse lives he must feed it. If the horse dies he must bury it. No such responsibility attaches to a share of stock. The owner is practically powerless through his own efforts to affect the underlying property... Physical property capable of being shaped by its owner could bring to him direct satisfaction apart from the income it yielded in more concrete form. It represented an extension of his own personality. With the corporate revolution, this quality has been lost to the property owner much as it has been lost to the worker through the industrial revolution.’ AA Berle and GC Means, The Modern Corporation and Private Property (1932) Book I, ch IV, 64 The Wall Street Crash saw the total collapse of stock market values, as shareholders realized that corporations had become overpriced. They sold shares en masse, meaning meant companies found it hard to get finance. The result was that thousands of businesses were forced to close, and they laid off workers. Because workers had less money to spend, businesses received less income, leading to more closures and lay-offs. This downward spiral began the Great Depression. Berle and Means argued that <b>under-regulation</b> was the primary cause in their foundational book in 1932, The Modern Corporation and Private Property. They said directors had become too unaccountable, and the markets lacked basic transparency rules. This led directly to the New Deal reforms of the Securities Act of 1933 and Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. A new Securities and Exchange Commission was empowered to require corporations disclose all material information about their business to the investing public. Because many shareholders were physically distant from corporate headquarters where meetings would take place, new rights were made to allow people to cast votes via proxies, on the view that this and other measures would make directors more accountable. Given these reforms, a major controversy still remained about the duties that corporations also owed to employees, other stakeholders, and the rest of society. After World War Two, a general consensus emerged that directors were not bound purely to pursue [...] "shareholder value" [...] but could exercise their discretion for the good of all stakeholders, for instance by increasing wages instead of dividends, or providing services {{for the good of the}} community instead of only pursuing profits, if it was in the interests of the enterprise as a whole. However, different states had different corporate laws. To increase revenue from corporate tax, individual states had an incentive to lower their standards in a [...] "race to the bottom" [...] to attract corporations to set up their headquarters in the state, particularly where directors controlled the decision to incorporate. [...] "Charter competition", by the 1960s, had led Delaware to become home to the majority of the largest US corporations. This meant that the case law of the Delaware Chancery and Supreme Court became increasingly influential. During the 1980s, a huge takeover and merger boom decreased directors' accountability. To fend off a takeover, courts allowed boards to institute [...] "poison pills" [...] or [...] "shareholder rights plans", which allowed directors to veto any bid - and probably get a payout for letting a takeover happen. More and more people's retirement savings were being invested into the stock market, through pension funds, life insurance and mutual funds. This resulted in a vast growth in the asset management industry, which tended to take control of voting rights. Both the financial sector's share of income, and executive pay for Chief Executive Officers began to rise far beyond real wages for the rest of the workforce. The Enron scandal of 2001 led to some reforms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (on separating auditors from consultancy work). The global financial crisis of 2007 led to minor changes in the Dodd-Frank Act (on soft regulation of pay, alongside derivative markets). However, the basic shape of corporate law in the United States has remained the same since the 1980s.|$|E

In this study, both <b>under-regulation</b> and over-regulation of affect and positive and negative somatoform and psychoform dissociative experiences were assessed. BPD and SoD diagnoses were confirmed or ruled out in 472 psychiatric inpatients using clinical interviews and clinical multidisciplinary consensus. Affect dysregulation and dissociation were measured using self-reports. <b>Under-regulation</b> (but not over-regulation) of affect was moderately related to positive and negative psychoform and somatoform dissociative experiences. Although both BPD and SoD can involve dissociation, there is a wide range of intensity of both somatoform and psychoform dissociative phenomena in patients with these diagnoses. Compared with other groups, SoD patients more often reported low levels of dissociative experiences and reported fewer psychoform (with or without somatoform) dissociative experiences. Compared with the other groups, patients with both BPD and SoD reported more psychoform (with or without somatoform) dissociative experiences. Evidence was found for the existence of 3 qualitatively different forms of experiencing states. Over-regulation of affect and negative psychoform dissociation, commonly occurring in SoD, can be understood as inhibitory experiencing states. <b>Under-regulation</b> of affect and positive psychoform dissociation, commonly occurring in BPD, can be understood as excitatory experiencing states. The combination of inhibitory and excitatory experiencing states commonly occurred in comorbid BPD + SoD.

40|$|Emotion {{over-regulation}} {{in infancy}} has seldom {{been the focus}} of empirical research. This study analysed the specificities of overregulation when compared with <b>under-regulation</b> (maladaptive) and adaptive regulation by testing its association with attachment, dyadic emotional interaction, and temperament. The sample consisted of 52 low-risk mother–infant dyads. During a home visit, dyadic emotional interaction was assessed in the daily routines and free play of 10 -month-old infants. The infant’s emotion regulation was assessed using the Shape Sorter Task, and a temperament questionnaire was completed by the mother. Attachmentwas assessed at 12 or 16 months using the Strange Situation. As hypothesized, (i) emotion overregulation (versus adaptive regulation) was predicted by a lower quality of dyadic emotional interaction and marginally by avoidant attachment; (ii) over-regulation (versus <b>under-regulation)</b> was predicted by avoidant attachment; and (iii) the predictive role of avoidant attachment was substantiated after controlling for another measure of mother–infant interaction. Contrary to expectations, temperament did not distinguish between emotion regulation styles. The link between over-regulation and lower quality of mother–infant emotional interaction and avoidant attachment was demonstrated. There is empirical support to the claim {{that it is possible to}} identify emotion overregulation in infancy and that it is a maladaptive style of emotion regulation.

40|$|We {{develop a}} theory of {{self-control}} based on the dual process approach of Hare, Camerer and Rangel (2009).

The model has testable implications that depart form traditional analyses of temptation, self-control, hyperbolic discounting and cue triggered behavior. First, choices can be affected by distractors or other tasks orthogonal to the decision. Second, the like-lihood of consuming a tempting good endogenously depends on environmental cues and, in particular, on how tempting the good is expected to be.

40|$|Objective Ephedrine is {{not only}} efficacious in the {{treatment}} of numerous ailments, but also {{has a long history of}} misuse. Research was needed to examine ephedrine policy over time in order to determine potential regulatory flaws that allowed misuse to continue. Methods This review is based on primary literature derived from systematic searches of historical and scientific archives, as well as grey literature. Results Ephedrine managed to pass through numerous regulatory loopholes within seventy years. Despite warnings of misuse over the latter half of the century, ephedrine, and its herbal source, ephedra, were regulated in a piecemeal fashion and remained easily available to the public. Health authorities have struggled to control ephedrine, as an amphetamine "look-alike," as a methamphetamine precursor, as a dietary supplement, and as a medication. Despite being a potentially dangerous stimulant, <b>under-regulation</b> was perhaps more problematic than the substance itself. Conclusions Tighter control of all ephedrine products, drugs and dietary supplements alike, might have prevented adverse outcomes and allowed this substance to remain available in a safer manner.

40|$|The present paper {{discusses}} {{the advantages and}} disadvantages of centralising regulatory competencies in the European telecommunications sector. As we demonstrate, political economy suggests that an over- rather than an <b>under-regulation</b> of telecommunications markets has to be expected. This tendency has been strengthened by the allocation of competencies under the new regulatory framework which endows the European Commission with far reaching veto rights under the so-called article 7 procedure. In order to delimit the risk of over-regulation through institutional safeguards, it should be easier for regulators to deregulate than to regulate a market. Current suggestions and ambitions by the Commission to extend its veto right or to even establish a European regulator for telecommunications should be dismissed. Instead, we suggest limiting the Commission’s veto rights to (a) markets, in which regulation creates significant international externalities and (b) cases, where national regulators do not move into the direction of deregulation. If, however, a national regulator decides to deregulate a market, the Commission’s ex ante veto right should be abandoned (but ex post intervention by the Commission still be possible) in order not to hamper deregulation which tends to be the desired result, in principle...|$|E

Limitations of the ARI were addressed by increasing its numerical resolution and generalizing the parameter space. In 16 healthy subjects, recordings of ABP (Finapres) and CBF velocity (ultrasound Doppler) were performed at rest, before, during and after 5 % CO(2) breathing, and for six repeated thigh cuff maneuvers. The unconstrained model produced lower predictive error (p < 0. 001) than the original model. Unconstrained parameters (K'-D'-T') were significantly different from K-D-T but were still sensitive to different measurement conditions, such as the <b>under-regulation</b> induced by hypercapnia. The intra-subject variability of K' was significantly {{lower than that of}} the ARI and this parameter did not show the unexpected occurrences of zero values as observed with the ARI and the classical value of K.

40|$|Globally, {{groundwater}} {{is by far}} {{the largest}} store of liquid freshwater, making it a key component of a secure water supply. However, {{over the past few decades}} the amount of usable groundwater available around the world has rapidly decreased. This depletion is caused primarily by mismanagement (e. g., overpumping, contamination, and <b>under-regulation),</b> but also by reduced natural recharge due to climate change and urbanization. Management of groundwater resources is particularly challenging for the nearly 600 aquifers that are transboundary, meaning that they extend across international political borders. To understand how governance mechanisms can reduce water insecurity in transboundary groundwater contexts, we review key literature from what we view as the most relevant fields: groundwater management, water security, international water law and international water governance. We then formulate a set of recommendations for improved groundwater governance that can address the specific physical nature of groundwater systems, enhance water security, and apply to transboundary groundwater settings. We argue that groundwater governance in transboundary contexts requires processes that (1) enhance context-specific and flexible international mechanisms; (2) address the perpetual need for groundwater data and information; (3) prioritize the precautionary principle and pollution prevention, in particular; (4) where appropriate, integrate governance of surface and subsurface water and land; and (5) expand institutional capacity, especially of binational or multinational actors...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} {{the paradox of}} prudential <b>under-regulation</b> in an economy that adopts financial reform, a reform which exposes the economy to future financial crises. There is individual-uncertainty about the crisis incidence, and the probability of the crisis is updated sequentially applying Bayesian inference. Costly regulation can mitigate the probability of the crisis. We identify conditions where the regulation level supported by the majority is positive after the reform, but below the socially optimal level. Tranquil time, when the crisis would not take place, reduces the regulation intensity. If the spell of no crisis is long enough, the regulation level may drop to zero, {{despite the fact that}} the socially optimal regulation level remains positive. The less informative is the prior regarding the probability of a crisis, the faster will be the drop in regulations induced by a no-crisis, good luck run. The challenges facing the regulator are aggravated by asymmetric information, as is the case when the public does not observe regulator’s effort. Higher regulator effort, while helping avoiding a crisis, may be confused as a signal that the environment is less risky, reducing the posterior probability of the crisis, eroding the support for costly future regulation. The other side of the regulation paradox is that crisi...|$|E
40|$|Regulating {{emerging}} industries is challenging, even controversial at times. <b>Under-regulation</b> {{can result}} in safety threats to plant personnel, surrounding communities, and the environment. Over-regulation may hinder innovation, progress, and economic growth. Since one typically has limited understanding of, and experience with, the novel technology in practice, {{it is difficult to}} accomplish a properly balanced regulation. In this work, we propose a control and coordination policy called soft regulation that attempts to strike the right balance and create a collective learning environment. In soft regulation mechanism, individual agents can accept, reject, or partially accept the regulator’s recommendation. This non-intrusive coordination does not interrupt normal operations. The extent to which an agent accepts the recommendation is mediated by a confidence level (from 0 to 100 %). Among all possible recommendation methods, we investigate two in particular: the best recommendation wherein the regulator is completely informed and the crowd recommendation wherein the regulator collects the crowd’s average and recommends that value. We show by analysis and simulations that soft regulation with crowd recommendation performs well. It converges to optimum, and is as good as the best recommendation {{for a wide range of}} confidence levels.

40|$|Rules, regulations, and {{policies}} {{are the basis}} of civilized society and are used to coordinate the activities of individuals who {{have a variety of}} goals and purposes. History has taught that over-regulation (too many rules) makes it difficult to compete and <b>under-regulation</b> (too few rules) can lead to crisis. This implies an optimal number of rules that avoids these two extremes. Rules create boundaries that define the latitude an individual has to perform their activities. This paper creates a Toy Model of a work environment and examines it with respect to the latitude provided to a normal individual and the latitude provided to an insider threat. Simulations with the Toy Model illustrate four regimes with respect to an insider threat: under-regulated, possibly optimal, tipping-point, and over-regulated. These regimes depend up the number of rules (N) and the minimum latitude (Lmin) required by a normal individual to carry out their activities. The Toy Model is then mapped onto the standard 1 D Percolation Model from theoretical physics and the same behavior is observed. This allows the Toy Model to be generalized to a wide array of more complex models that have been well studied by the theoretical physics community and also show the same behavior. Finally, by estimating N and Lmin {{it should be possible to}} determine the regime of any particular environment. Comment: 6 pages, 5 figures, submitted to IEEE HS...|$|E
30|$|Our {{starting}} point is the observation that development in a society, as defined above, cannot occur {{without the use of}} scarce resources. This economic principle of the scarcity of resources is the necessary condition that motivates choice, and holds equally true for most social and political variables as well. A social entity like a church is influenced in its decisions by the scarcity of resources it controls to the same extent as a profit maximizing firm even if its motivations and the nature of its output may be different. The local church may, for example, consider its output to be a vector comprising the promotion of religiosity, providing shelter and food to the homeless, and educating children. The extent to which this output grows over time (that is, the church develops) will always be constrained by the revenues it is able to collect, the assets it has in place, the availability of pastors, and so on. In the absence of regulation (e.g., laws over property rights and the enforcement of contracts) that controls the exploitation of scarce resources, the competitive drive to exploit these limited resources would result in their rapid depletion and, consequently, lead to a growth path that is unsustainable. This market failure is the tragedy of the commons, and given the broad definition of development under consideration, it is an inevitable logical consequence of the <b>under-regulation</b> of society’s resources.|$|E

40|$|Cell {{competition}} {{describes the}} result of a mechanism of fitness comparison undertaken by cells inhabiting the same tissue, that leads to the elimination of the weakest cells and, in the physiology, to the formation of a homogeneous organ. Over the years, many molecules have been identified that are involved in cell competition and among them MYC oncoprotein: from Drosophila to mammals, cell populations characterised by higher expression of MYC induce apoptotic death of the neighbours, allowing the fittest to acquire an advantage in space occupancy. My work defined the presence of markers of MYC-mediated cell competition in primary and secondary human carcinomas and demonstrated through experiments in human cancer cell lines that MYC modulation is per se sufficient to induce competitive behaviours in both genetically distant and identical cells. Noteworthy, MYC <b>under-regulation</b> in the fittest cell line is sufficient to undermine its competitive status, suggesting a role for MYC-mediated cell competition in the selective growth of tumour clones and, as a consequence, in cancer evolution. In addition, I was able to demonstrate a functional cooperation between MYC and p 53 in this phenomenon. The data obtained in the Drosophila model, where MYC over-expressing and MYC knock-down clones have been induced within a growing tumour, suggest that MYC-mediated cell competition is normally at work in these malignant cells, and it shapes cancer evolution through the elimination of the less fit cells (with lower levels of MYC) and the expansion of the most performant ones (with higher levels of MYC), demonstrating an evolutionary role played in defining the composition {{and the size of the}} final mass...|$|E
40|$|Because {{we live in}} a {{world of}} {{national}} laws and international business activity, the regulation of a single transaction can be affected by several different legal regimes. Within domestic systems, even if sub-units such as the states of the United States exist, there is a central government authority that can regulate such transactions. In the international arena, the problems are more difficult. There is no supranational authority able to impose international standards; attempts at harmonization must overcome greater differences in culture and legal tradition; and national lawmakers are often resistant to any form of international rulemaking. How, then, should international cooperation proceed? There is no simple answer to this question. Different legal issues require different solutions, and even within a single issue there is often strong disagreement about how to proceed. Nevertheless, the business of international cooperation must proceed. Business activity crosses national borders, and the law has no choice but to deal with that activity. Even if there is no international cooperation or coordination, domestic laws will interact with international activity affecting business decisions and human welfare. Under this laissez-faire system, each jurisdiction proceeds as it wishes, without concern for the policies of other jurisdictions. Without some coordination on choice of law rules, however, a system of this sort will almost always lead to overlapping jurisdictions, conflicting legal regimes, and over-regulation. The existing antitrust law regime fits this description. International transactions are subject to the simultaneous regulation of domestic regulators in many countries, and each national regulator operates independently.

40|$|Financial {{markets are}} given to excesses and if a boom/bust {{sequence}} progresses beyond a certain point, it will never revert to where it came from. Instead of acting like a pendulum, financial markets have recently acted more like a wrecking ball, knocking over one economy after another. ” - A testimony before the US House Banking Committee, Sep, 1998. There are three parts to this paper. The first part examines the time series behaviour of the equity indices of ten countries. Using Robinson (1995 a) ’s modified GPH estimator and Robinson (1994 a) ’s average periodogram estimator for the differencing parameter, we have detected that not all the financial series exhibit long range dependence. Non-detection of long memory lends support to imposition of policies to block free capital flows. The results suggest that Indonesia has a stronger case to restrict capital flows than Malaysia. In the second part, we attempt to determine the degree of the contagion effects. This {{has important implications for}} diversification of portfolio risks as the increased co-dependence of asset prices increases risk in the short-term. Using correlations of equity indices across markets, we can get an indication of the severity of the contagion. The evidence suggests that these effects increased significantly and systematically as the Asian crisis worsen shortly after it started on 2 July 1997. The third part discusses the implications of the results for fund management. We argue that new regulations and hedge fund techniques have contributed to large capital flows that cause severe damage to economies. In the interim period of <b>under-regulation</b> of “leverage” and before the establishment of a new international financial architecture, adopting hedge fund’s market neutral or zero investment techniques may be a way to preserve Asian capital...|$|E
40|$|Contemporary {{critiques of}} {{globalization}} processes often {{focus on the}} potential leveling of regulatory standards and the export by the United States of neoliberal norms of deregulation and market facilitation. This Article, in contrast, examines the extrajurisdictional impact of EU data protection policy {{on the behavior of}} private parties in the United States, leading to a ratcheting up of U. S. privacy standards. The Article takes a socio-legal approach, exploring the many ways in which the EU Directive on the Processing of Personal Data affects U. S. practice through changing the stakes of US. players-including regulators, businesses, privacy advocates, lawyers, and privacy service providers-and thereby changing the playing field in the United States on which competing interest groups clash. In examining the interaction of EU law, US. practice, and international trade rules, the Article finds that WTO law, rather than constraining the Directive 2 ̆ 7 s extra-jurisdictional impacts, provides the EU with a shield against U. S. retaliatory threats, thereby further facilitating a trading up of data privacy standards. The Article concludes by examining the conditions under which cross-border exchange can lead to a leveraging up of social protections such as data privacy standards. These include: the desire for firms to expand their markets, subjecting themselves to foreign regulatory policy; European states 2 ̆ 7 ability to enhance their bargaining power by acting collectively, using the large EU market as leverage to change foreign standards; the nature of data privacy protection as a luxury good demanded by residents of relatively wealthy, more powerful jurisdictions; the externalities of U. S. <b>under-regulation</b> of privacy protection, legitimizing EU intervention; and the constraints of WVTO supranational trade rules on U. S. unilateral retaliatory threats. While the Article focuses on the issue of data privacy, its analysis applies to broad areas of law affected by economic globalization...|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis comprises {{a study of}} three aspects of inflation targeting and monetary policy in 7 OECD countries that {{were the first to}} introduce inflation targeting as well as the U. S. and the Eurozone who do not pursue an explicit inflation targeting strategy. The first chapter finds that transparency which often has accompanied the inflation targeting strategy of central banks has not helped the private sector to better predict the future policy interest rate. Furthermore, no significant improvement was observed after inflation targeting was introduced. The private sector’s forecast of the policy rate is better in the non-inflation targeting countries. By estimating the Taylor using GMM in chapter two, it can be shown that most of the inflation targeting countries do not focus more on controlling inflation than they focus on decreasing the output gap- which is what one would expect to find. The exception is New Zealand who seems to be the only country to run a “hard core” inflation targeting strategy. The estimated coefficients show that most of the inflation targeting countries have been focusing roughly equally on promoting output and controlling inflation and in some cases even more on stimulating output then on controlling inflation. This brings attention to the arguments of two famous monetary policy economists i. e. Svensson and Taylor. Taylor blames the house price bubble in the U. S. on too loose monetary policy. Svensson argues that monetary policy is not to blame but, instead, financial <b>under-regulation</b> is. After investigating both arguments empirically it is possible to conclude that even though loose monetary policy created the foundation of extensive house price increases, it is the lack of regulation in the financial sector that caused the global financial crisis...|$|E
40|$|This article explores how {{speculative}} bubbles {{undermine the}} effectiveness of securities regulations and spawn epidemics of securities fraud. A brief historical survey demonstrates that stock market bubbles almost invariably coincide with epidemics of securities fraud, and provides a compelling argument that the outbreak of fraud in the Enron era did not stem merely from factors unique to the 1990 s, but from the dynamics of an asset price bubble as well. Drawing on perspectives from securities law practice and economic theory, the article argues that bubbles dilute the deterrent effect of antifraud rules and promote deregulation. Both effects alter the calculus of securities law compliance for public companies and market intermediaries. In turn, diluted regulations and deregulation further fuel a bubble 2 ̆ 7 s expansion. The article creates a basic model for how bubbles promote deregulation. During the formation a bubble, three interrelated cycles - the business cycle, the cycle of investor confidence and the regulatory cycle - generate feedback for each other (by stimulating excessive economic growth, investor trust in {{the integrity of the}} market and deregulation). When a bubble bursts, these three cycles reverse and generate negative feedback (through recession, a collapse of investor trust and re-regulation). The interaction of these cycles creates the potential for a perverse pattern of <b>under-regulation</b> or deregulation as bubbles form - the moment when more oversight is needed - and re-regulation {{in the aftermath of a}} bubble - once the economy and investor trust have already been damaged. The article also explores how the dynamics of a bubble can undermine the deterrent effect of anti-fraud rules on securities issuers and market intermediaries by distorting the rational calculus of compliance, potentially exacerbating behavioral biases and raising information and agency costs...|$|E
40|$|Successive {{episodes of}} {{financial}} crises {{raise the question}} of whether international financial law is insufficiently robust to support global financial stability. International financial law can be characterized today as a set of “soft law” rules and standards adopted voluntarily and differentially by individual states and lacking any real international enforcement mechanism. The pre- 2009 system of international financial regulation failed to check financial excesses in globalized financial markets. Liberalization and globalization led to <b>under-regulation</b> accompanied by lack of accountability mechanisms and brought the failure of international financial institutions and systemic instability. The crisis that commenced in 2008 -the most severe blow to the international financial system since 1929 -calls for a fundamental re-design of regulatory standards, financial risk prevention and management mechanism and the international financial architecture. This study argues that a hard-law based international financial law (based on the enforcement of regulations) is essential for maintaining global financial stability as the existing soft-law based financial regulatory architecture failed not only to prevent and manage the crisis in 2008 but also in checking those financial excesses committed by the de-regulatory and liberal regimes which threatened global financial stability, the discipline of international financial law and its regulatory institutions. This study thus argues that a law-based enforcement mechanism for international financial regulation is essential for global financial stability. This research questions the fundamental basis of the existing international financial architecture (soft law) and explores the need for a compliance-based model (based on legitimacy of regulations and accountability of the regulatory bodies) in the international financial system. In so doing, this thesis proposes fundamental changes and alternative perspectives to the existing framework of international financial law which is in need of a fundamental re-design as has been proved by recurring episodes of financial disruptions. published_or_final_versionLawDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|After the 2008 recession, it is {{difficult}} to imagine that the public is investing billions of dollars in publicly traded entities with little regulation of board conflicts and no fiduciary duty protections. Yet, that is precisely the case for more than $ 284 billion of investments. Investors have flocked to publicly traded limited partnerships (LPs) and limited liability companies (LLCs), collectively known as master limited partnerships (MLPs), because many are high-performing energy companies with a tax preference. MLP market capitalization, while only $ 14 billion in 2000, topped $ 284 billion as of February 2016, and more initial public offerings are on the horizon. Dazzled by the possibility of high yields, individual investors are likely unaware that they do not enjoy the same fiduciary duty protections that apply to stockholders of publicly traded corporations. Delaware corporate law offers significant investor protections largely flowing from an unwaivable duty of loyalty. In contrast, Delaware’s alternative entity scheme permits the waiver of all fiduciary duties in LP and LLC agreements. Publicly traded LPs are also exempt from listing rules that normally require independent board members. Even where special committees vet conflicted transactions, committee members may have affiliations with the MLP’s corporate sponsor and owe conflicting duties to the sponsor and the limited partners. Scholars suggest that “uncorporate” substitutes could theoretically mitigate the absence of fiduciary duties, but empirical research shows that publicly traded MLPs rarely adopt such substitutes. The realities of the MLP marketplace leave investors with only the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which is not a substitute for traditional fiduciary duties. This Article exposes the many obstacles investors have faced in obtaining remedies under MLP agreements. It argues that Contractarian theories or legal diversification constructs do not justify the <b>under-regulation</b> of publicly traded MLPs. This Article recommends reinstating the duty of loyalty for MLPs and ending the LP exception from board independence requirements...|$|E
40|$|Thrombin is {{a tightly}} {{regulated}} serine protease that acts at the terminus {{of the blood}} coagulation cascade, performing proteolytic activation of platelets and converting soluble fibrinogen into insoluble fibrin. In complex with thrombomodulin, thrombin acts as an anticoagulant by activating protein C. The strict regulation of thrombin is essential to organism survival, as <b>under-regulation</b> of clot formation results in amplified blood loss and over-regulation leads to pathological clot formation. In human health, hemophilia, pulmonary emboli, venous thrombi, myocardial infarctions and ischemic strokes are all tied to the misregulation of thrombin. Structurally, thrombin consists of a double [Beta]-barrel core that is conserved {{among members of the}} trypsin-like protease family with extended active site loops that are not conserved. Recent evidence has suggested that the regulation of thrombin is tied much more to dynamics than previously thought and NMR is the ideal method of study. Chapter II outlines the process of isotopic labeling, expression, refolding, activation and purification of recombinant thrombin from E. coli. Once this barrier was overcome, the next hurdle in the study of thrombin by NMR was resonance assignments, discussed in Chapter III. Results from resonance assignment of thrombin with PPACK occupying its active site vs. the S 195 M mutant representing apo-thrombin showed major chemical shift perturbations between the forms and a large degree of resonance line broadening that abrogated the signal, an effect that was mostly abolished upon active site ligation by PPACK. In Chapter IV, using a combined NMR and computational approach (performed by P. Gasper and P. Markwick of the McCammon lab) the dynamics of PPACK- thrombin are characterized and the solution ensemble is modeled. The results indicate that even with the active site occupied by PPACK, thrombin undergoes a large degree of structural fluctuations on timescales ranging from picoseconds all the way to milliseconds. The equivalent study was undertaken on S 195 M-thrombin as discussed in Chapter V. As compared to PPACK-thrombin, the apo-like S 195 M-thrombin, apo-thrombin displays a remarkable degree of dynamics in the [mu]s-ms timescale. These results reinforce the paradigm shift towards an ensemble view of thrombin activity states and substrate recognitio...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} was {{to provide}} a systematic exploration of the nature and distribution of dysfunctional affect regulation, its associated phenomena, and retrospectively reported potentially traumatizing events in 475 patients diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD), somatoform disorder (SoD), comorbid BPD+SoD, and a psychiatric comparison group (PC) to provide a baseline against which to compare the hypothesized elevations in dysfunctional self and affect regulation. Whereas some patients react to adversities with inhibited experiencing and social withdrawal, others react hyper-emotionally and tend to cling to a significant other to alleviate stress and regulate to base-line. Van Dijke described dysfunctional self and affect regulation as operating in vicious cycles that approach the long-term sequelae of trauma-by-primary-caretaker from a developmental perspective. Activation of dysfunctional regulation seems to follow trauma-by-primary-caretaker associated negatively biased cognitive-emotional information processing. However, when potentially neutral situations are processed and evaluated as threatening or potentially harmful, dysfunctional regulation is activated false positively. Consequently, this may result in interpersonal misunderstanding and disappointments, which in turn condition and uphold the insecure attachment representation/ working models eventually turning into dysfunctional regulation vicious circles. The present studies demonstrated that dysfunctional regulation presents in patients in three qualitatively different forms: Inhibitory-, Excitatory-, and combined Inhibitory & Excitatory (IE) -regulation. Symptoms include disturbances in self-regulation across several domains of functioning including affective, cognitive, somatic, relational, reflective, executive, behavioral, and psycho-physiological functioning. However, no disorder-specific form of dysfunctional affect regulation or dissociation was found. Adults who were exposed to potentially traumatizing events by primary caretaker during childhood often demonstrate complex psychological disturbances that are not fully captured by the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) diagnosis. In an attempt to capture the complex symptom presentation that includes not only posttraumatic stress symptoms, but also other symptoms reflecting disturbances predominantly in affective and interpersonal self-regulatory capacities, dissociation, somatization, and shattered or altered basic beliefs, Complex PTSD (CPTSD) was introduced as a clinical syndrome for adults. This disorder fundamentally involves the focus of this study: Dysfunctional affect regulation and dissociation. Childhood trauma-primary-caretaker plays a role in both over- and <b>under-regulation</b> of affect depending on the type and developmental epoch of the traumatization in psychiatrically-impaired adults, specifically in BPD. Also, CPTSD can be distinguished from BPD and/or SoD. By including patients of both genders and other diagnoses as well as BPD, the present study demonstrated that CPTSD is not exclusively or always found with (and therefore not synonymous with) BPD. The combined results of this dissertation suggest that further clinical and research studies are needed in order to further the development of empirically-based clinical assessment and treatment protocols for trauma-related self and affect dysregulation in adults with a range of Axis I and II psychiatric disorders. Also, disorder-specific assessment and treatment methods and guidelines for BPD, SoD and severe affective, and anxiety, may be enhanced by the addition of approaches focused on the types of dysfunctional affect- and self regulation that were identified and examined in the present studies...|$|E
