40|$|To ensure network-centric {{and other}} systems provide {{relevant}} capability to the C 2 user, effort {{needs to be}} expended in understanding the requirements, designing the appropriate solution, developing the capability and implementing for acceptance. The cognitive systems engineering and the software systems engineering communities struggle with the difficulties of understanding a domain and its challenges and then handing research results to designers and developers so that shared understanding {{of the problem and}} possible solutions exists. They also struggle with the more frustrating challenge of a developed system being implemented but not enthusiastically embraced by the end-user. Participatory Design (PD) has a goal of engaging researchers, designers, developers, practitioners and end-users in all of the various activities leading to the successful development and implementation of systems. PD is an <b>umbrella</b> <b>methodology</b> which includes studies, theories, conferences and practices (Muller and Kuhn, 1993; Kensing and Blomberg, 1998; Madsen, 1999). This paper will discuss two methods which embrace participatory concepts. The first is Elicitation by Critiquing (EBC) and the second is Value Elicitation.

40|$|The {{world is}} {{becoming}} increasingly focused on an imperative {{to reduce the cost}} of services. Managers at this cutting edge of practical organizational development are trying many ways to achieve this. The major focus of this research uses a systems psychodynamic approach to investigate the role taken up by part-time contract managers in an Australian university. These part-time roles frequently fail in the longer term. This approach provides an understanding of the unconscious group dynamics that may cause the role to fail. The study considers contract managers {{with a wide range of}} skills and experience. It also looks at the organization&rsquo;s understanding of the contract management role. The researcher was an insider researcher for the first part of the study, then an outsider researcher. During the outsider period, case study research of other change activities, consideration of dissimilar cultures between the client and contractor were undertaken, as well as completion of an organizational role analysis. It was expected that a method for implementing the contract management role would be trialled. However, when the researcher moved from an insider to an outsider researcher this proved impossible. This seemed to result from a loss of authority and the participants engaging psychological defenses. Nevertheless an implementation methodology is developed which relies on a comparison between the research and a previous change activity. The research used action research as an <b>umbrella</b> <b>methodology.</b> As the research progressed the potential for organizational role analysis to form the key change activity developed. However, refusal to continue as part of the research by one powerful participant raised the anxieties of other participants. Consequently the role analysis was used as a research method only. An hypothesis has been developed that considers the interaction of two simultaneously held roles. When a role is given to a person, the person then takes the role depending on the way it is conceptualised in their mind. When a person takes up a role in a single system there is limited scope for other systems to influence that role. The research hypothesises that a second system may be taken in two ways: as a system integrated into a single functional simple system or as a complex system and role where the simple roles act as influencers. In this case the simple roles act unconsciously to collapse the complex role. This is often regarded as the contract manager neglecting their role. The research then used the complex system and role hypothesis as well as a review of culture clash to propose a way forward. Organizational role analysis is proposed as a tool to achieve conscious and unconscious congruency of a system-in-the-mind of a group. It has the capacity to collaboratively identify a suitable organizational system, to identify and understand the conflicting issues of two organizational cultures and to achieve congruency in the minds of the organizations members...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Obesity {{and dental}} caries are global public health {{problems}} which can impact in childhood {{and throughout the}} life course. In simple terms, childhood dental caries and body weight are linked via the common risk factor of diet. An association between dental caries and obesity has been described {{in a number of}} studies and reviews. However, similarly, a relationship has also been noted between low body weight and caries experience in children. This protocol will provide the framework for an umbrella review to address the following question: Does the available evidence support a relationship between dental caries experience and body weight in the child population? Methods This review protocol outlines the process to carry out an umbrella systematic review which will synthesise previous reviews of childhood dental caries experience and body weight. An <b>umbrella</b> review <b>methodology</b> will be used to examine the methodological and reporting quality of existing reviews.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 University of Washington Abstract Tracing Hybrid Collectives of Illness, War, and Medicine in Twentieth- and Twenty-First Century Narratives of Illness Barbara J. Simons Chair of the Supervisory Committee Professor Monika Kaup, Chair English “Varieties {{of warfare}} and war-related illnesses, mental and physical,” is the red thread that organizes this dissertation. My study compares and {{contrasts}} illness narratives (fiction and non-fiction) from modernism {{and the early}} twentieth century with texts of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries to better understand the psychologies of war trauma and techniques of narration from opposite sides of the twentieth century. In narratives about traditional and nontraditional warfare, I analyze how the social is deconstructed by the powerful mediators of illness and death and has to be reassembled in new forms of social organization. By tracing real connections across realms of existence normally separated by fields of study, I analyze the connections between medicine, literature, and the events related to war and its history. The compelling strength of this dissertation is the comparative breadth of its perspective. The methodologies I deploy are not normally engaged in conversation with each other: the “narrative medicine” of medical practitioners, the “narratives of illness” of cultural and formalist literary critics and humanist scholars, and “medical intertextual” investigation that links literary, medical, and social texts. Moreover, my literary analysis is consistently based on historicized readings, such as of shell shock and PTSD and of the medical quarantine. As my <b>umbrella</b> <b>methodology</b> to justify such a procedure, I rely on Bruno Latour’s Actor-Network Theory in an effort to trace hybrid networks that bridge “narrative medicine” and fictional and non-fictional literary representations of mental breakdown and physical diseases linked to social disruptions caused by modern warfare. My aim is to exceed the boundaries of individual patient narratives (pathographies) by connecting them with other illness narratives in order to complicate and thus redefine the meaning of “illness narratives. ” Furthermore, I study the artistic innovations in narrative renditions of the experiences of illness and profoundly altered mental states to enrich literary studies about formal techniques of representation. In Chapter 1, I juxtapose Virginia Woolf’s modernist novel, Mrs. Dalloway, to Vera Brittain’s personal memoir, Testament of Youth, to compare fictional and non-fictional narratives about the rich lifeworlds of war-related illness and suffering of World War I. As a Latourian scholar, my focus is on the varieties of hybrid actor networks among soldiers, civilians, and health care providers amidst the reorganization of society for modern war, with its calamitous effects on mental health and physical well-being. Based on my findings, I argue that shell shock was a human rebellion against the unlivable situation of modern industrial warfare. While “rebellious”—as is important to note—shell shock was often an ineffective and self-destructive escape into illness. For some individuals, shell shock precipitated a profound personal transformation in their quest for a new state of health. Indeed, the rebellion of shell shock opposed the official master narrative of modern industrialized warfare, according to which the medical diagnoses of “war neuroses” were not neutral scientific diagnoses, but medical instruments of the military system to discipline and treat soldiers in order to return them to the front. This chapter argues that the modernist literary, non-fictional, and philosophical works by Virginia Woolf, Vera Brittain, and Martin Heidegger selected here constitute counter-narratives of authenticity that challenge the veracity of the world of modern warfare as constructed by official nationalist and imperialist narratives. Moreover, Testament of Youth offers an alternative model for the fruits of melancholia and the workings of grief. Brittain’s autobiography derives its value not as an “individual pathography” but as the story of one life lived in acknowledgement and affirmation of our frailties, our mortality, and our shared responsibility for one another. In Chapter 2, I study early twenty-first century nonfictional anthropological representations of the experiences of war and PTSD, Fields of Combat: Understanding PTSD among Veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan by Erin P. Finley and Breaking Ranks: Iraq Veterans Speak Out Against the War by Matthew Gutmann and Catherine Lutz, and one novel, Sparta, by Roxana Robinson. As a Latourian scholar, I distinguish the hybrid actor-networks that connect the two purist realms of medicine (objective; facts) and the self (subjective; the power of memory in the form of flashbacks). As I show, the contemporary diagnosis of PTSD (like {{the early twentieth century}} diagnoses of war neuroses) is founded on a rhetorical maneuver of purification that isolates mental trauma from the warfare that generates it; in short, PTSD is a disembodied, abstracted concept of the mind—an instance of a scientific artifact that Latour calls a “factish”—under the make-believe control of psychiatry. But real trauma produces hybrids connected to multiple sites that cannot be discounted as externalities. To counter the medical segregation of (mental) illness from politics, I trace the empirical connections in the actual “assemblages” between the psychological suffering of U. S. soldiers and their combat experiences to reconsider “PTSD” as a complex hybrid that proliferates in response to war and its structural violence. Through the sharp contrasts I draw between the techniques of narration in each text, I show that opposing views about PTSD are based on conflicting answers to a much larger question: Is the human mind accurately understood as a machine or as part of an immensely complex, adaptive, and embodied living organism? Having debunked “PTSD” as a reductive biomedical diagnosis that erases moral concerns from the conversation, I propose my solution: A new version of PTSD that restores the “matters of concern” of veterans themselves via an ecological concept of the mind that replaces biological determinisms. In Chapter 3, health and illness and the dying process are connected to nontraditional modes of warfare: In Blindness, when the population becomes white-blind, the government’s internment of the white-blind in medical quarantines makes war on the contagious people, not the microbe. In Death with Interruptions, the suspension of death is an allegory about the (mis) application of the critical care technology developed in war medicine to the civilian world in the end-of-life care of the terminally ill. Both novels are anti-realist fables that defamiliarize disease and death as fantastic conditions that are inaccessible to the medical/clinical gaze. In Blindness, I argue that rather than serving the purpose of protecting the public health, the location of the quarantine for the white-blind in an abandoned mental asylum unmasks the real carceral nature of medical quarantine as a distant successor to Foucault’s eighteenth century asylum for the insane. Indeed, the ostensible gesture of restoring health to the body politic is exposed as the internment of the white-blind in a twentieth century concentration camp, as aptly characterized in Agamben’s Homo Sacer. Blindness undercuts the master narrative for the containment of infectious disease, Patricia Wald’s “outbreak narrative. ” After the universal spread of white-blindness, the small society led by the doctor’s wife “reassembles the social” in new patterns of organization amidst accelerating chaos and disequilibrium. In Death with Interruptions, the deconstruction of traditional social life with the proliferation of the dying is narrated alongside the reinvention of the social among the dying and their families. In my allegorical reading, I argue there is a parallel between the novel’s fantastic suspension of death and the ontological condition of prolonged dying on the life-support machines of modern medicine that reveals the hubris of epistemological assumptions about the human capacity to control time and space through technological knowledge...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Although meta-analyses support {{associations}} between obesity and several cancers, {{some of the}} claimed associations may be flawed due to inherent biases. We evaluated strength {{and validity of the}} evidence for adiposity and risk of cancer development and mortality using an <b>umbrella</b> review <b>methodology.</b> Methods: Design: An umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Data sources: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane database of systematic reviews and manual screening. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies: Systematic reviews or meta-analyses of observational studies that evaluated the association between indices of adiposity and risk of developing or dying from cancer. Main Outcomes: Primary analysis focused on cohort studies exploring associations for continuous contrasts of adiposity. Data synthesis: The evidence was graded into strong, highly suggestive, suggestive or weak after applying criteria that included the statistical significance of the random effects summary estimate and of the largest study in a meta-analysis, the number of cancer cases, between-study heterogeneity, 95 % prediction intervals, small study effects, excess significance bias and sensitivity analysis with credibility ceilings. Results: 204 meta-analyses investigated {{associations between}} seven indices of adiposity and the development or death from 36 primary cancers and their sub-types. Of the 95 meta-analyses that included cohort studies and used a continuous scale to measure adiposity, 12 (13 %) associations for nine cancers demonstrated strong evidence. Elevated BMI was associated with a higher risk of developing oesophageal adenocarcinoma, colon and rectal cancer in men, biliary tract, pancreatic, endometrial cancer in pre-menopausal women, kidney cancer and multiple myeloma. Weight gain and waist to hip circumference ratio were associated with a higher risk of post-menopausal breast cancer in women who have never used hormone replacement therapy and endometrial cancer, respectively. Conclusions: Although the association of adiposity with cancer risk has been extensively studied, associations for only nine cancers were graded with strong evidence. Other associations could be genuine, but there is still substantial uncertainty about them. In an era where obesity is becoming one of the greatest public health problems, evidence on the strength of the associated risks may allow finer selection of individuals at higher risk of cancer, who could be targeted for personalized prevention strategies...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: There is {{considerable}} {{debate about the}} strength {{and quality of the}} evidence base which underpins principles of good design of the lived environment and the causal pathways to good mental and physical health. In England, there has been no single source of summary evidence to guide good practice. The University of the West of England (UWE) was commissioned by Public Health England (PHE) to provide a UK focused evidence review which PHE adapted into a more ‘user-friendly' version to help public health professionals working with planners in local government to support planning decisions which can promote health Methods: UWE conducted an umbrella literature review to assess existing review level evidence. Unlike traditional systematic reviews, umbrella reviews involve a ‘rapid review' approach to evidence synthesis to produce an evidence overview in relatively short time. Key objectives were to: 1) assess the impact of the built and natural environment on health in five key domains. · appraise the quality and strength of the available evidence, using an agreed grading system; 2) use the findings of the review to develop a series of diagrams illustrating the linkages between planning principles, impact and health related outcomes, 3) use UK focused evidence and case studies, wherever possible. Results: Umbrella literature reviews bring together a wide range of evidence to explore what is known about a topic to guide decisions of policy makers. The results of the project are a series of practical diagrams that illustrate the linkages, and strength of evidence, between spatial planning and health based on the findings from the umbrella literature review of the impacts of the built environment on health for each 5 domains of: built environment topics: neighbourhood design, housing, healthy food, natural and sustainable environment, and transport. The full research study upon which the diagrams were based are also publicly available. Discussion: Although there is much guidance supporting action on the built and natural environment to improve health outcomes, the evidence base is still a matter of debate amongst the scientific and the practitioner communities. Using <b>umbrella</b> review <b>methodology</b> to examine the strength of the evidence of these health impacts, we developed a series of diagrams that illustrate the linkages and strength of evidence in five domains [...] These are intended to support public health and planning professionals when considering the health impacts of proposed local planning developments. We will present the findings of the review and summary diagrams for the five domains...|$|R
40|$|Aims: With the {{increase}} in the number of systematic reviews available, a logical next step to provide decision makers in healthcare with the evidence they require has been the conduct of reviews of existing systematic reviews. Syntheses of existing systematic reviews are referred to by many different names, one of which is an umbrella review. An umbrella review allows the findings of reviews relevant to a review question to be compared and contrasted. An umbrella review 2 ̆ 7 s most characteristic feature is that this type of evidence synthesis only considers for inclusion the highest level of evidence, namely other systematic reviews and meta-analyses. A methodology working group was formed by the Joanna Briggs Institute to develop methodological guidance for the conduct of an umbrella review, including diverse types of evidence, both quantitative and qualitative. The aim of this study is to describe the development and guidance for the conduct of an umbrella review. Methods: Discussion and testing of the elements of methods for the conduct of an umbrella review were held over a 6 -month period by members of a methodology working group. The working group comprised six participants who corresponded via teleconference, e-mail and face-to-face meeting during this development period. In October 2013, the methodology was presented in a workshop at the Joanna Briggs Institute Convention. Workshop participants, review authors and methodologists provided further testing, critique and feedback on the proposed methodology. Results: This study describes the methodology and methods developed for the conduct of an umbrella review that includes published systematic reviews and meta-analyses as the analytical unit of the review. Details are provided regarding the essential elements of an umbrella review, including presentation of the review question in a Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome format, nuances of the inclusion criteria and search strategy. A critical appraisal tool with 10 questions to help assess risk of bias in systematic reviews and meta-analyses was also developed and tested. Relevant details to extract from included reviews and how to best present the findings of both quantitative and qualitative systematic reviews in a reader friendly format are provided. Conclusions: Umbrella reviews provide a ready means for decision makers in healthcare to gain a clear understanding of a broad topic area. The <b>umbrella</b> review <b>methodology</b> described here is the first to consider reviews that report other than quantitative evidence derived from randomized controlled trials. The methodology includes an easy to use and informative summary of evidence table to readily provide decision makers with the available, highest level of evidence relevant to the question posed...|$|R
40|$|Education {{was one of}} the {{sectors that}} was being {{decentralized}} except 6 sectors (Defense, Security, Foreign Affair, Justice, Finance, and Religious Affair) that are still under the management of the central government, centralized. During the decentralization of education, the mechanism of education planning has become difficult and complicated. This is due to the complexity of the procedure that the plan has to go through; a long process, starting from the preparation of supporting data until the final stage of deciding the most appropriate programs and activities for the country. Besides, this process has to involve all stakeholders of education, the approval from the parliament must be obtained so that the proposed budget can be funded. The main objectives of this research are two fold. First, to make better or to improve the education planning mechanism at the Directorate for Development of Junior Secondary Education (DDJSE). Second, through improved planning, to expand the scope of service to the citizens of the country so that every citizen in Indonesia will have an equal access to Junior Secondary Education (JSE) and {{to improve the quality of}} JSE in Indonesia. To achieve these research objectives, practitioner research was used as an <b>umbrella</b> of research <b>methodology</b> with action research as the main research method. Data were collected by using data collection methods: questionnaires, observations, interviews, and document analysis from related sources. The research was done from 2004 until 2008. This research involved all of the staff from the DDJSE, some staff from provincial and district education office, and other stakeholders of education. The involvement of all level of education staffs was aimed to find the most appropriate plan that suitable for all three levels of education offices. Whatever happens in one of the three levels of education offices will affect the other education offices. During this research, the following actions were conducted as part of the education planning process: creation of current and complete data (EMIS), development of evaluation criteria for effective decentralized education planning, bottom up planning, coordination and synchronization, development of clear division of labour in education planning among the layer of education bureaucracy based on government regulation number 38 / 2007, capacity building, participation decision making, intensive and regular monitoring and evaluation. At the end of the research completion, the researcher concluded that effective education planning had significantly increased the access to and the quality of JSE from year to year. The increase in access to JSE is shown by the significant improvement in Gross Enrolment Rate (GER) at JSE. The improvement of the quality of JSE is shown by the constant increase in students scores at the National Examination (UN). This research does not claim to be the only reason for the success of the DDJSE, but through this Research by Project there is clear improvement in JSE in Indonesia. In addition, the research approach, results, and strategies have been very valuable for the DDJSE in improving the access and quality of JSE in Indonesia...|$|R
