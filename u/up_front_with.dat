5|$|Both clubs {{lined up}} in a {{traditional}} 4–4–2 formation: a four-man defence (comprising two centre-backs and left and right full-backs), four midfielders (two in the centre, and one on each wing) and two centre-forwards. Wenger opted to pair Gilles Grimandi with Vieira in midfield and Wiltord <b>up</b> <b>front</b> <b>with</b> Henry, leaving Bergkamp on the substitutes' bench. Ashley Cole played in defence, ahead of Sylvinho, who did not feature in the matchday squad. For Liverpool, Houllier named Owen in the starting line-up, and chose Šmicer and Murphy to play in midfield. Gary McAllister, Patrik Berger and Fowler began the final as substitutes.|$|E
25|$|In {{his first}} year as a {{full-time}} professional, Larsson scored 34 goals for Helsingborg and his partnership <b>up</b> <b>front</b> <b>with</b> veteran striker Mats Magnusson helped the side win promotion to the top Swedish division, the Allsvenskan. His star continued to rise the following year, as he netted 16 goals to help Helsingborg to a respectable mid-table finish.|$|E

He played {{alongside}} his Corinthian colleagues Tip Foster (also making his international debut) and Gilbert Smith <b>up</b> <b>front,</b> <b>with</b> William Oakley in defence. Wilson scored after three minutes, but Wales equalized through Billy Meredith and the match finished 1–1. He retained his {{place for the}} next England match, against Scotland on 7 April.

25|$|He {{scored on}} the final day of the season against Wimbledon – it was his only senior goal of that campaign. By that game United were Premiership champions and Robson finally won the league {{championship}} medal that he had been trying to gain since his days at West Bromwich Albion some 15 years earlier. It was not just injuries that were restricting the 36-year-old Robson's first-team chances. Eric Cantona had been signed during the 1992–93 campaign and played <b>up</b> <b>front</b> <b>with</b> Mark Hughes, while Hughes's former strike-partner Brian McClair had been converted into a midfielder. This counted against Robson and the biggest blow came in the summer of 1993 when United signed Nottingham Forest's Roy Keane, but even this did not quite signal the end for Bryan Robson at Manchester United.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{win against}} Sunderland, Spurs played Wigan {{in a home}} fixture. In what would become an {{historic}} fixture, Tottenham won 9–1. Redknapp chose to start with Peter Crouch <b>up</b> <b>front</b> <b>with</b> Defoe, and the move paid off as Spurs took the lead after a Crouch header from an Aaron Lennon cross that put Spurs 1–0 up at half-time. The second half entered the record books as Spurs scored eight goals, five coming from Defoe. Other goals came from Lennon and Niko Kranjčar, along with a David Bentley free-kick, originally given as a Chris Kirkland own goal before the dubious goal panel awarded the effort to Bentley. It became Tottenham's biggest ever Premier League win, the second biggest in Premier League history, and {{only the second time}} any team had scored nine goals in the Premier League since its inception in 1992. Defoe also got himself in the record books, becoming only the third player to score five goals in a Premier League match, the others being Andy Cole and Alan Shearer.|$|E

Carpentier, who qualified in 25th, was observed speeding after he exited pit road and was limited to one lap time. On his run, he went up onto the track's dirty side in turn two and removed his foot from the accelerator pedal.

500|$|New manager Colin Appleton used Swan in {{all four}} playing {{position}} within the first fourteen days of the 1989–90 campaign; his time in goal came when goalkeeper Iain Hesford was injured in a defeat to Bournemouth and {{had to leave the}} field at half-time. Appleton failed to control his players, and with his team bottom of the division, he was sacked in October – much to the amusement of Swan and the team. His replacement Stan Ternent managed to instil the discipline necessary to get the best performances out of Swan and the other 'big characters' at the club. Ternent dragged Swan off just fifteen minutes into his first match as manager, but calmed the fury of his player when he explained the change was a tactical one. Ternent then put Swan <b>up</b> <b>front</b> <b>with</b> Andy Payton, and the pair put in a 28-goal haul in the league between them – with Swan claiming eleven of these despite missing fifteen games with anterior cruciate ligament damage in his knee. Following his recovery Swan played in defence, and the [...] "Tigers" [...] managed to save their second tier status and finish in mid-table.|$|E
500|$|Villa's form {{continued}} into the 2006–07 season, with the striker forming a partnership <b>up</b> <b>front</b> <b>with</b> former Real Madrid star Fernando Morientes. Between them, Villa and Morientes netted 43 goals in all competitions. That year also saw Villa debut in the UEFA Champions League; his first match was a qualifying match, coming on as a late substitute in a 1–0 first leg loss against Red Bull Salzburg. He went on to start the second leg and scored in a 3–0 win which saw Valencia qualify for the Champions League group stages. Crucial goals against Roma and Shakhtar Donetsk helped Valencia qualify for the knockout stages, where they faced Inter Milan. Villa scored a free-kick goal in the first leg away from home, while one of Inter's defenders complained that Villa had [...] "made us look like idiots, all on his own". Valencia went through to the quarter-finals, where they faced Chelsea. Villa featured in both games but {{failed to make the}} score sheet as Valencia were knocked out by the London team 3–2 on aggregate.

Despite this, Cole managed to score seven goals before leaving for Blackburn Rovers after falling behind to the formidable partnership of Van Nistelrooy and Solskjær, forcing him into a [...] "super sub" [...] role.|$|E

In October 1986, Manilow, along with Bruce Sussman, Tom Scott, and Charlie Fox, went to Washington, D.C. for two days of meetings with legislators, including lunch with then Senator Al Gore (D-TN). They were there to lobby against a copyright bill put forward by local television broadcasters that would mandate songwriter-producer source licensing of theme and incidental music on syndicated television show reruns and would disallow use of the blanket license then in effect. The songwriters said without the blanket license, artists would have to negotiate <b>up</b> <b>front</b> <b>with</b> producers individually, without knowing if a series would be a success. The license now pays according to a per-use formula. Manilow said that such a bill would act as a precedent for broadcasters {{to get rid of}} the blanket license entirely.|$|E
2500|$|Between {{leaving the}} Moments and joining The Small Faces, Steve Marriott joined The Checkpoints. Chris Clements: [...] "He {{actually}} approached us (The Checkpoints) {{and said he}} needed to fulfill some gigs that were pending. This was in 1965, he was {{with us for a}} couple of months. We rehearsed at The Kentish Drovers in the Old Kent Road in South London. He got us to learn James Brown numbers, which at the time we weren't very up in. One particular memory sticks in my mind. When we rehearsed with him, he almost spoke the words of the song, rather than sang the words. He was listening to us, making sure we got the backing right, so he didn't put himself out vocally. But when we did the first gig with him, out came this fantastic soul voice, we all looked at each other, and our mouths fell open! When doing the gigs, we would pick him up outside the Brewery in Romford road Essex. He always had a small case with his harmonicas in. His harmonica playing was excellent. Our transport at that time was a converted ambulance, and Steve would always sit <b>up</b> <b>front</b> <b>with</b> the owner driver, (a man in his early 50s) rather than sit in the back talking to us. He {{seemed to me to be}} a bit of a loner. Even when I had a conversation with him, he always seemed to be looking past me, as though in a hurry to be somewhere else. He was quite a heavy smoker as I recall. We did various venues in Essex, around the Basildon area. He had no guitar, he would use our lead guitarist's red Fender Strat. Steve would put many guitar breaks in the James Brown songs. So we would all huddle around our drummer Gary Hyde who would watch Steve. When Gary stopped, we stopped, when Gary started, we started, so by using those tactics the gigs went well. We had photos taken at the various venues at that time, I wish someone would dig them out from wherever, I would love to see them." ...|$|E
