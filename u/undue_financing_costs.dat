40|$|In {{this paper}} we study interdependencies between {{corporate}} {{foreign investment and}} the capital structure of banks. By committing to invest predominantly at home, firms can reduce the credit default risk of their lending banks. Therefore, banks can refinance loans to a larger extent through deposits thereby reducing firms’ effective <b>financing</b> <b>costs.</b> Firms thus {{have an incentive to}} allocate resources inefficiently as they then save on <b>financing</b> <b>costs.</b> We argue that imposing minimum capital adequacy for banks can eliminate this incentive by putting a lower bound on <b>financing</b> <b>costs.</b> However, the Basel II framework is shown to miss this potential. financial contracting, multinational corporations, internal capital markets...|$|R
40|$|This paper hypothesizes {{that hot}} {{convertible}} debt windows represent periods with lower convertible debt-related <b>financing</b> <b>costs.</b> Supporting this premise, {{we find that}} the stock price impact of Western European convertible debt announcements is significantly less negative during hot convertible windows. Importantly, this result holds while controlling for equity market, straight debt market and macroeconomic conditions. In addition, stockholders are less sensitive to issuer- and issue-specific <b>financing</b> <b>costs</b> during hot convertible markets. Overall, these findings indicate that hot convertible markets represent windows of opportunity for convertible debt issuance. Firms with high idiosyncratic <b>financing</b> <b>costs</b> act accordingly by timing their convertible offering during a hot market. JEL classification: G 14; G 3...|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} offered diverse {{contractual}} forms of alliance, {{in which the}} supply chain partners coordinate their decisions for greater joint performance in an entirely self-interested way. Prior literature implicitly assumes free inventory financing. However, this assumption is questionable in the real marketplace. Firms frequently finance their working capital {{from a variety of}} credit sources, such as banks, and incur positive costs of the funds for inventory. Surprisingly, the impact of inventory <b>financing</b> <b>costs</b> on supply chain coordination has not been sufficiently investigated by supply chain academics. We address this issue by explicitly assuming capital-constrained agents and positive inventory <b>financing</b> <b>costs.</b> Specifically, we consider four extensively discussed coordination mechanisms for investigation: (i) all-unit quantity discount, (ii) buybacks, (iii) two-part tariff, and (iv) revenue-sharing. We show that, under the assumption of positive inventory <b>financing</b> <b>costs,</b> these contracts fail to achieve joint profit maximization if each agent relies on direct financing from a financial institution. Positive <b>financing</b> <b>costs</b> call for trade-credit in order to subsidize the retailer's <b>costs</b> of inventory <b>financing.</b> Using trade-credit in addition to the contracts, the supplier fully coordinates the supply chain for the largest joint profits. Moreover, positive inventory <b>financing</b> <b>costs</b> make revenue-sharing less profitable than the other three contracts. We present three different schemes for coordination in a decentralized supply chain, using buybacks, quantity discount, and two-part tariff, respectively. We also derive the optimal trade-credit rate not only for the supplier's profit, but also for joint supply chain profit.

40|$|Part I of this {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} effect of <b>financing</b> <b>costs</b> on {{the efficiency of the}} T-bill futures market. The cost-of-carry model is used and three types of <b>financing</b> <b>costs</b> are selected as proxies for RP (repurchase agreement) rates. The results suggest that the cost-of-carry model assuming a constant RP rate is unreliable in explaining the pricing of T-bill futures. A search for "true" <b>financing</b> <b>costs</b> shows that such <b>financing</b> <b>costs</b> could be a nonlinearly weighted rate of the term RP rate (or the 90 -day-maturity T-bill rate) and the federal funds rate. Theoretically implied RP rates in the year of 1983 are also generated for comparisons. Part II examines the impact of inflation uncertainty on the futures-forward rate differential. The cost-of-carry model assuming a constant RP rate ignores the future fluctuations of <b>financing</b> <b>costs.</b> A "risk premium" could arise due to inflation uncertainty. This part provides evidence that there exists a systematic relationship between the daily futures-forward rate differences and the inflation rate. Part III provides a theoretical treatment of the optimal arbitrage investment under uncertainty and of equilibrium pricing in the T-bill futures market. A dynamic stochastic programming model shows that a "myopic" property exists in the T-bill futures market in the sense that expectations of the future one-period price movements do not exert an impact on the current optimal arbitrage investment decision under uncertainty. It shows, however, that such a "myopic" property is not pure in that expectations of <b>financing</b> <b>costs</b> in the next period affect the investment decision in the current period. Equilibrium pricing of the T-bill futures is obtained under arbitrage arguments. It shows that an equilibrium price is achieved {{at the point where the}} expected current one-period arbitrage profits are zero when cost-of-carry is required, even in a multi-period setting...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we employ firm-level data {{to analyze}} {{to what extent}} {{financing}} conditions of non-financial corporations in the Euro Area depend on country-specific factors, in particular the respective country's government bond yield and the share of non-performing loans to the corporate sector. Moreover, we assess whether this relationship has changed during the European debt crisis.

However, the further increase of corporate <b>financing</b> <b>costs</b> in stressed Euro area countries during the year 2012 can not be explained by these yields, but by the share of non-performing loans.

40|$|This paper bridges the {{gap between}} {{investment}} timing options and investment-cash flow sensitivities of financially constrained firms. In a real options model with costly external financing we derive optimal investment timing as a trade-off of present and expected future <b>financing</b> <b>costs.</b> While a pure-quantity constrained firm always overinvests in investment states, we find that <b>financing</b> <b>costs</b> can induce both voluntary delay and acceleration of investment, and we show that both investment volume and investment-cash flow sensitivities are non-monotonic in financing constraints. For high- and low-liquidity firms, we find that sensitivities are increasing in con-straints, and that both dimensions of constraints, namely liquidity constraints and capital market frictions inducing <b>financing</b> <b>costs,</b> have similar effects on investment. In contrast, the effects are ambiguous for firms with intermediate liquidity. JEL Classification: G 31, G 3...|$|R

Further comparative static analysis shows: the bank’s profit decreases with its <b>financing</b> <b>cost,</b> and the bank will require higher loan rate and less collateral with its <b>financing</b> <b>cost</b> increasing; Decreasing transaction cost and better legal environment will facilitate the bank to require more collateral and lower loan rate...|$|R
40|$|This paper studies optimal {{monetary}} and fiscal policy {{in a small}} open economy. Two forces in the economy impose orthogonal restrictions on <b>financing</b> <b>costs</b> across governments. The first force requires constant <b>financing</b> <b>costs</b> across governments to have time consistent optimal policy of hours. The second force always asks for time-varying <b>financing</b> <b>costs</b> across governments {{in order to have}} time consistency optimal policy of consumption and real money balances. Thus, optimal {{monetary and}} fiscal policy is time inconsistent. However, if preferences (and/or productivity) satisfy certain conditions, the former force disappears and optimal monetary and fiscal policy becomes time consistent. The results hold with both flexible exchange rate regimes and fixed exchange rate regimes. The latter indicates that a credible fixed exchange rate regime does not help render optimal policy time consistent. ...|$|R

Schmidt-Eisenlohr (2011) shows that this choice is relevant as it allows firms to trade off differences in <b>financing</b> <b>costs</b> and contract enforcement across countries and thereby has large effects on aggregate trade flows. This paper extends the model to allow for product complexity and uses data from the World Bank Enterprise Survey to test the main predictions. In line with the model, {{a larger share of}} international sales is paid after delivery (Open Account) if enforcement is weak and <b>financing</b> <b>costs</b> are low in the source country.

The strategy involves direct local currency borrowing from National Provident Funds for multinational firms' investments in Asian-Pacific countries and the use of local currency sales revenue for servicing the debt. The strategy outlined satisfies the preferences of all the participants involved.

However, uncertainty about future financing opportunities also induce firms to rationally time the equity market, even if they have no immediate needs for cash. The stochastic financing conditions have rich implications for investment and risk management: (1) investment can be decreasing in financial slack; (2) firms may invest less as expected future <b>financing</b> <b>costs</b> fall; (3) investment-cash sensitivity, marginal value of cash, and firm's risk premium can all be non-monotonic in cash holdings; (4) speculation (as opposed to hedging) can be value-maximizing for financially constrained firms. ...|$|R

Furthermore, the cohorts born during recessions pay higher <b>financing</b> <b>costs</b> and use smaller amounts of bank loans, even after their creditworthiness is controlled for.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{a model of}} (irreversible) investment under uncertainty for a firm facing external <b>financing</b> <b>costs.</b> Such a firm prefers to fund its investment through internal funds, so that the firm’s optimal investment policy and value now depend {{on the size of}} its retained earnings. We show that the standard real options results are significantly modified when there are external <b>financing</b> <b>costs.</b> Investment and abandonment hurdles are higher in the presence of external <b>financing</b> <b>costs,</b> and most importantly the investment hurdle is highly non-monotonic in the firm’s internal funds: when these are sufficient to cover capital expenditures then the investment hurdle is decreasing in the size of internal funds. But when they fall short then the firm’s invest-ment policy becomes more and more conservative when it accumulates cash, as it has stronger incentives to postpone its investment until the point where it has sufficient internal funds to entirely cover its investment outlays. Our analysis brings out the sub-tle interactions between sources of funds (external, internal, and prospective retained earnings once the investment is undertaken) and the optimal timing of investment...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the practice of "tying," which occurs when an underwriter lends to an issuer {{around the time of}} public securities offering in order to secure underwriting business. We examine the following questions: (i) How far do investment banks compete directly in tying? (ii) How does tying affect issuers, and in particular, their <b>financing</b> <b>costs?</b> (iii) Why do underwriters tie lending to underwriting? We find that investment banks engage in a substantial amount of tying, contrary to concerns that they are disadvantaged by tying practices. We find that tying allows firms to reduce their <b>financing</b> <b>costs,</b> as tied issuers receive lower underwriter fees on seasoned equity offerings and discounted loan yield spreads. These results are robust to matching methodology developed by Heckman, Ichimura, and Todd (1997, 1998). Lower <b>financing</b> <b>costs</b> are consistent with informational economies of scope from combining lending with underwriting. From the underwriters' perspective, we find that tying helps build relationships that augment an underwriter's expected investment banking revenues by increasing the probability of receiving both current and future equity underwriting busines...|$|R
