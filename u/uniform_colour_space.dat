To perform this transformation, digitized colour images offour natural scenes were described by their colour point distributions in the CIELUV <b>uniform</b> <b>colour</b> <b>space.</b> A {{new set of}} images was created by varying the chroma value of each pixel while lightness and hue-angle were kept constant. In three experiments, subjects judged the perceptual quality, colourfulness and naturalness of all images on a ten-point numerical category scale. Results indicate that both image quality and naturalness are non-monotonically related to colourfulness with an optimum near the original image. In general, a linear relation is found between perceptual image quality and naturalness...|$|E

We {{address the issue of}} spatial and temporal uniformity in the acquisition system. In a surface grading application it is crucial to ensure the uniform response of the system through time and space. All the results presented for surface grading were obtained using real data from the ceramic tile industry. The VxC TSG database is public and can be accessed at www. disca. upv. es/vision/vxctsg. We present a method based on soft colour-texture descriptors computed in perceptually <b>uniform</b> <b>colour</b> <b>spaces.</b> The method is parameterized and the involved factors are studied using two statistical procedures; experimental design and logistic regression. Although it is not a new theoretical contribution, we have found and demonstrate that a simple set of global colour and texture statistics, together with well-known classifiers, are powerful enough to meet stringent factory requirements for real-time and performance. Also the method is compared with two other approaches from the scientific literature; Colour Histograms and Centile-LBP.

Since {{the adoption of}} the color spaces CIELAB and CIELUV by the CIE in 1976, several other uniform spaces have been developed. We studied most of these spaces and evaluated their uniformity for small as well as larger color differences- Therefore, several criteria have been defined based On color discrimination data and appearance systems. The main difference between color spaces based on discrimination data and spaces that model appearance systems is reflected in a different size of the chroma distance unit compared with the lightness unit, If spaces based on the same kind of data (discrimination data or appearance systems) are compared with each other, they are all almost equally uniform. BFD(l:c), for example, is said to be more uniform than CMC(l:c), but, based on confidence intervals of 65 %, there is no significant difference between them. if the proposed color difference formula of the CIE is compared with these distance functions, it also performs equally well. The SVF space and OSA 90 space on the other hand should be better than OSA 74.

40|$|The {{following}} research elaborates {{on some of}} the 'semantic' and 'algorithmic' aspects of the categorization process for thc colour domain. The structure of colour categories is argued to resemble the structure of Ihe distribution of colours in the perceived world. This distribution can be represented as colour statistics in some perceptual and approximately <b>uniform</b> <b>colour</b> <b>space</b> (e. g., the CIELUV colour space). We propose that the process of colour categorization is determined by a trade-off between (1) accuracy in representation of perceived colours and (2) simplicity of the category system. Colour categorization can be represented through the grouping of colour statistics by clustering algorithms (e. g., K-means). These assumptions are analysed on the basis of colour statistics of 630 natural images in the CIELUV colour space...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Reliable colour constancy by industry for colour conducted to quantify metamerism. and metamerism indices are highly desired quality control. Two experiments were the degree of colour constancy and In the colour constancy experiment, 240 wool samples were prepared and scaled using a magnitude estimation method {{by a panel of}} 5 experienced observers under sources D 65, A and TL 84. 2 corresponding data sets derived from the experimental results were used to test various chromatic adaptation transforms. The results clearly show that the BFD transform gave the most precise prediction than the other transforms. Attempts were also made to derive 4 new transforms from four independent data sets. These gave similar performance as that of the BFD, but overcome the BFO's problem (incapable of predicting some of the high saturated colours). Hence, these transforms should be used with confidence for predicting the degree of colour constancy. This experimental results were also used to test various <b>uniform</b> <b>colour</b> <b>spaces</b> and <b>colour</b> appearance models. The Hunt 94 model gave the most precise prediction to the colourfulness and hue results. Modification was made to its lightness scale for improving the fit. In the metamerism experiment, 76 pairs of wool samples were prepared and assessed with 20 observations using a grey scale under 7 sources: D 65, A, TL 84, TL 83, P 27, W and WW. The experimental results were used to test 3 types of illuminant metamerism indices derived here. It was found that calculating colour difference using 3 colour difference formulae, i. e. CMC, BFD and CIE 94 gave the most precise prediction to the visual results. The degree of precision is quite satisfactory in comparison with typical observer precision. A new standard deviate observer (SDO) was also derived. This together with the CIE SDO and 1964 Observer were tested using the author's and the Obande's data. The results showed that the new SDO predicted results more accurate than those from the other two CIE Observers. An Observer Metamerism Index (OMI) was also derived to indicate the degree of metamerism based upon the new SDO. The results showed that the new SDO was more suitable for indicating the degree of observer metamerism...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} robust {{methods for}} determining {{the order of a}} sequence of stripes captured in an uncoded structured light scanning system, i. e. where all the stripes are projected with <b>uniform</b> <b>colour,</b> width and <b>spacing.</b> A single bitmap image shows a pattern of vertical stripes from a projected source, which are deformed by the surface of the target object. If a correspondence can be determined between the projected stripes and those captured in the bitmap, a spatial measurement of the surface can be derived using standard rangefinding methods. Previous work has uniquely encoded each stripe, such as by colour or width, in order to avoid ambiguous stripe identification. However, colour coding suffers due to uneven colour reflection, and a variable width code reduces the measured resolution. To avoid these problems, we simplify the projection as a uniform stripe pattern, and devise novel methods for correctly indexing the stripes, including a new common inclination constraint and occlusion classification. We give definitions of patches and the continuity of stripes, and measure the success of these methods. Thus we eliminate the need for coding, and reduce the accuracy required of the projected pattern; and, by dealing with stripe continuity and occlusions in a new manner, provide general methods which have relevance to many structured light problems...|$|R

Clinical effectiveness of the method was demonstrated on 62 clinical burn wound images obtained from digital colour photographs, yielding an average classification success rate of 82 % compared to expert classified images. ...|$|E

The issue of how to understand, and how to meaningfully display this type of data has been gaining interest since its development as a noninvasive investigative tool [1]. Several schemes have been developed, usually aimed at the display of the spatial geometric structure of each voxel characterized by its eigenvectors. However these efforts have used colour merely as a visualization device, without regard to an underlying metric structure between voxels. At the same time, some work has been developed on analyzing whole-brain structure using independent component analysis, making use of similarity between tensors to identify separated overall structures, e. g. for de-noising of spatial features. In this paper we consider using colour to understand these separated structures, mapping a true metric giving a similarity measure between tensors into a perceptually <b>uniform</b> <b>colour</b> <b>space,</b> so that colour difference corresponds to true difference.
