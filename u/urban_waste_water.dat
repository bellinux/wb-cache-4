25|$|The lack of {{wastewater}} treatment {{in some cities}} and towns discharging wastewater into sensitive areas is another matter of concern. In January 2008 the European Commission sent France a final warning alerting it {{that it will be}} taken to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) for the second time and possibly face fines unless it quickly brings its waste water treatment up to EU standards. France is not complying with the 1991 EU directive on <b>urban</b> <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> treatment. The deadline for treating all wastewater covered by the directive was 31 December 2000. In 2004 the European Court of Justice (ECJ) condemned France for failing to designate eleven areas as sensitive and for inadequate treatment facilities in a number of settlements which discharge their waste waters into these areas. The ECJ also found that 121 settlements breached the directive by discharging their waste waters into previously designated sensitive areas. In 2006 France designated the eleven areas as sensitive. However, 140 settlements – including the city of Paris – continue to discharge into these sensitive areas. With regard to the 121 settlements discharging into the previously designated sensitive areas France proceeded to rearrange them into 164 settlements, resulting in some settlements no longer meeting the threshold level of 10,000 residents at which the directive applies. The Commission considers such rearranging of settlements to avoid compliance with the directive unacceptable. In November 2009 it referred the matter to the ECJ.|$|E

The operating cost function of 103 plants shows that {{an increase in the}} sizes of the smaller ones generates strong economies of scale. A minimum efficient size at about 100, 000 inhabitants, however, inhibits the creation of large monopolies at a local level and allows to maintain indirect competition. Among the explanatory variables of the costs, the pollution load of the <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> takes on a high statistical significance and suggests environmental prevention. The recent introduction of advanced treatments is expensive, but their costs are balanced by a notable improvement in the pureness of the effluent.

40|$|<b>Urban</b> <b>waste</b> <b>waters</b> {{will often}} contain viruses, {{including}} human (and, topically, avian) viruses.

Presently there is some limited evidence that, even in predominantly matrix flow aquifers such as the Birmingham sandstone aquifer, viable human viruses can be transported to depths of at least 40 m. Horizontal transport distances are (even) less certain, but laboratory studies suggest survival times of < 2 years. To gain the knowledge necessary to develop rules for operation of AR schemes, a four-stranded approach is proposed: (i) field experimentation on a borehole array using bacteriophage as surrogates for human viruses; (ii) laboratory experimentation on intact cores; (iii) monitoring of virus concentrations at multi-level piezometers and pumping wells; and (iv) modelling. Work to date has concentrated on establishing the basic design of the field experiments, and has included hydraulic testing and checking for virus presence in the groundwaters of the test site...|$|R
2500|$|Portugal's {{membership}} of the European Community in 1986 and the EU <b>Urban</b> <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> framework directive of 1991 triggered a series of reforms undertaken {{by the government of}} then Prime Minister Cavaco Silva in order to modernize the sector, to improve service quality and to effectively use EU funds destined to the sector.

2500|$|Achievements Until {{the early}} 1980s, {{there was not}} a single {{municipal}} wastewater treatment plant in China. In that year, the country’s first municipal wastewater treatment plant was built in the city of Nanjing. Subsequently, China engaged in what is possibly the largest wastewater treatment investment program in history. It has been estimated that in 2006 there was sufficient capacity to treat 52% of municipal residential wastewater. According to the State Environmental Protection Agency the rate of urban wastewater treatment reached 57% in that year. The government's goal to achieve a level of 60% for treatment of municipal wastewater by 2010 was surpassed. [...] By 2010, 77.5% of domestic waste water was treated. Between 2001 and 2004, the number of cities that charge wastewater tariffs has increased from 300 to 475 out of 661 cities. According to the Notice on the Construction Plan for the Nation's <b>Urban</b> <b>Waste</b> <b>Water</b> Treatment and Recycling Facilities presented in the 12th Five-Year Plan by the General Office of the State Council, which was promulgated on May 4, 2012, the waste water treatment rate in the PRC will further improve by 2015.

40|$|In New Caledonia, the benthic {{communities}} {{living in}} the coral reef lagoon around Noumea city are subjected to regular shifts from oligotrophic conditions typical of lagoon waters to nutrient enrichment due to <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> inputs. The influence of ammonium pulses on microphytobenthos production was experimentally tested under varying light intensities {{in the vicinity of}} Noumea. Benthic oxygen, ammonium and silicon fluxes at the sediment-water interface were measured in situ using benthic enclosures. Three ammonium concentrations were tested. Gross primary production was doubled with a 13. 8 mu mol 1 (- 1) ammonium concentration increase. Fitted PI curves showed that maximum production (F-max) was linearly related to ammonium concentration, but not the optimal irradiance (I-k). Silicon fluxes were characterized by dissolution in the absence of light, a process that declined with increasing illumination. These results were attributed to microphytobenthos activity, mainly diatoms that are nutrient-limited and strongly reactive to ammonium inputs. Production may result from a multiplication of cells, but migration up to the water sediment interface may also be involved. Oxygen consumption was also significantly influenced by ammonium concentration as a positive linear relationship with added ammonium concentration was established. Even during short-term experiments, ammonium enrichment stimulated photoautotrophic production, increasing the energy available to heterotrophs. Furthermore, microbenthic activities as well as nitrate production were increased by ammoniaoxidizing bacteria able to grow chemolithotrophically at the expense of oxygen. Therefore, in the study area, pulses of <b>urban</b> <b>waste</b> <b>waters</b> resulted in a decrease of plant-related autotrophy in benthic communities. (c) 2004 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The {{scope of}} present {{paper is to}} carry out a model study on the lake Averno, a nearly water closed basin {{polluted}} by <b>waste</b> <b>waters</b> of nearby communities and by agricultural activities. Lake Averno is a natural basin in the Phlegrean Fields region about 15 km west of Naples (Italy). This lake was formed {{as a consequence of the}} collapsing of a large volcano, named Archiflegreo, which was active until historic times. The area around Phlegrean Fields presents signs of thermo-mineral spring streams (at Bagnoli, Pozzuoli and Lucrino) and natural (at Averno and Fusaro) spring streams (Martini et al. 1991; Celico et al. 1992). The water flowing into Lake Averno is essentially soft, with an average a flow rate of 42 dm 3 /s during the rainy seasons and almost zero in the summer months. The water basin is nearly elliptic (1000 m long and 700 m wide), covering a 0. 54 km 2 surface, and is 34 m deep at the center, with a total water volume of roughly 6. 000. 000 m 3. A canal which is almost 1 km long links the lake to the sea, carrying both spring and rain waters to the Lucrino coast in the Gulf of Pozzuoli (Cortini and Scandone 1987). The discharge into the sea trough this canal and the sedimentation constitute outputs of lake pollutants. Around the crater terraces with citrus fruits and vineyards are irrigated with the lake water. However Lake Averno is heavily polluted by the <b>urban</b> <b>waste</b> <b>waters</b> from overflows of the collector that carries residual waters into the Cuma Plant...|$|R

40|$|Lake Nemi is an {{interesting}} case of anthropogenic overexploitation which has caused its progressive environmental deterioration in the past decades. On this lake historical data about the trophic situation are available from 1975 to 1984. The research performed in 2002 - 03, about {{ten years after the}} diversion of <b>urban</b> <b>waste</b> <b>waters,</b> concerned a biological investigation on the phyto- and zooplanktonic communities, integrated with a physico-chemical analysis. The aims of our study are to evaluate the current water quality of the lake and compare it with the water quality observed in 1982 - 1983, when all biotic and abiotic components indicated a heavily compromised hypereutrophic condition. The water quality data and the comparison with a previous study point out that the biological aspects have partially changed (increased number of Cyanobacteria and phytoplanktonic taxa, particularly Clorophyta and Dinophyta; zooplankton composition changed at a species level, with the appearance of taxa associated to light trophic conditions), and the physico-chemical conditions significantly improved. The mean transparency, dissolved oxygen, nutrients and chlorophyll-a concentrations have all improved. Mean annual temperature at different depths increased, probably due to differences in climatic period and the lowering of the lake surface level (from 32. 5 to 27. 5 m in 1982 and 2002, respectively). Our results indicate a general improving trend in water quality is taking place since the diversion of <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> discharges.

A recent increase in <b>urban</b> <b>waste</b> <b>waters</b> from Chioggia town, as well as dockyards, shipping and fishing activities, affect this part of the lagoon. The aim of this study was to investigate the total mercury (THg) incidence in sediments and Nassarius reticulatus gastropods in order to assess its distribution and evaluate the level of contamination. THg concentration measured in bottom sediments ranged between 0. 1 and 3. 4 mg/kg d. wt. The enrichment factor (EF) showed high values (avg. 30, max 49) near the dockyards of Chioggia; the lowest (avg. 9, max 17) were found in the coastal marine sediments near the port entrance of the southern basin. THg in marine scavenger gastropods accumulated in N. reticulatus with concentrations falling within the range of 0. 3 – 1. 3 mg/kg d. wt. A positive correlation was found between THg concentration in sediments and in N. reticulatus in all sites, excluding the dockyards. A first local cause for mercury pollution might be attributed to the antifouling paints used in great quantity inthe recent past near the town of Chioggia. Moreover, fine suspended sediments associated with tidal flushing are suggested as possibly being the vehicle for pollutant dispersal from the Marghera industrial area to the whole of Venice’s lagoon...|$|R
