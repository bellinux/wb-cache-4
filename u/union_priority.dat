50|$|Black lung is {{actually}} a set of conditions and until the 1950s its dangers were not well understood. The prevailing view was that silicosis was very serious but it was solely caused by silica and not coal dust. The miners' union, the United Mine Workers of America, realized that rapid mechanization meant drills that produced much more dust, but under John L. Lewis they decided not to raise the black lung issue because it might impede the mechanization that was producing higher productivity and higher wages. <b>Union</b> <b>priorities</b> were to maintain {{the viability of the}} long-fought-for welfare and retirement fund, which would be sustained by higher outputs of coal. After the death of Lewis, the union dropped its opposition to calling black lung a disease and realized the financial advantages of a fund for its disabled members.|$|R

The study is {{based on interviews with}} union representatives and key informants in Norway, Ireland, and Canada. The main argument we make is that the reorientation of <b>union</b> <b>priorities</b> and the willingness to engage in innovative strategies that has characterized hotel unionism in Toronto and Dublin is not detectable in the case of Oslo. This might be a result of the relatively strong position Norwegian trade unions have in national industrial relations, but can at the same time leave local hotel unions vulnerable as they are facing low unionization levels and corporate restructuring which they are unable to tackle effectively...|$|R
40|$|Allergic {{rhinitis}} (AR) {{and asthma}} represent global health problems for all age groups. Asthma and rhinitis frequently coexist {{in the same}} subjects. Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) was initiated during a World Health Organization workshop in 1999 (published in 2001). ARIA has reclassified AR as mild/moderate-severe and intermittent/persistent. This classification closely reflects patients 2 ̆ 7 needs and underlines the close relationship between rhinitis and asthma. Patients, clinicians, {{and other health care}} professionals are confronted with various treatment choices for the management of AR. This contributes to considerable variation in clinical practice, and worldwide, patients, clinicians, and other health care professionals are faced with uncertainty about the relative merits and downsides of the various treatment options. In its 2010 Revision, ARIA developed clinical practice guidelines for the management of AR and asthma comorbidities based on the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. ARIAis disseminated and implemented inmore than 50 countries of the world. Ten years after the publication of the ARIA World Health Organization workshop report, it is important to make a summary of its achievements and identify the still unmet clinical, research, and implementation needs to strengthen the 2011 European <b>Union</b> <b>Priority</b> on allergy and asthma in children...|$|E

In our analyses we have included once all 6320 mapped habitat with Nardus grasslands. Under 1950 – 2000 climate scenario, both models exhibited high AUC values (> 0. 9). The predicted geographical distribution of Mesophilous oligotrophic mountain pasture and Subalpine oligotrophic pastures coded as VNG and PON habitat modeled by Maxent and BIOCLIM shows differences between the modeling approaches, with Maxent predicting smaller areas (12 % less) of suitable habitat than BIOCLIM. For the future climate scenario (double CO 2) the surface with PON+VNG decreases by 31 % for Maxent and 26 % for BIOCLIM. However both models show significant shifts of the Nardus habitat due to climate change. The distribution maps obtained indicate vulnerability areas to biodiversity loss and of interest to be monitored. The output of models will contribute to the Black Sea Catchment Observation Systems to be further accessible to scientists, decision-makers and the general public...|$|E

40|$|Within European <b>Union</b> <b>priorities,</b> the {{problematic}} of available water sources have paid attention {{through the development}} of an integrated policy to reduce and control pressures and consequently leakage. In drinking pipe systems Pressure Reducing Valves (PRV) are used as dissipative devices for pressure control through a localized pressure drop. The use of micro-turbines or pumps operating as turbines (PT) seem to be an alternative and sustainable solution to either control the pressure as well to produce energy. This type of solution generally well accepted within renewable energy sources can be adopted as a mitigation method to control the systems loss, in particular the excess available energy which would be dissipated and the rupture occurrence. The existence of high topographic gradients are favorable to adopt these solutions, avoiding the use of high pressure pipe classes with the consequent minimization of costs and the benefit associated to energy yielding, which although depends on the daily consumptions is always a guaranteed energy.

In line with the European <b>Union</b> <b>priorities</b> in this matter, this project has been designed to identify and tackle the indicators that raise a red ag about which individuals or communities are being radicalised and recruited to commit violent acts of terrorism. Therefore, the main goals of this project will be twofold: On the one hand, it is needed to identify the main features and characteristics {{that can be used to}} evaluate a risk situation, to do that a risk assessment methodology studying how to detect signs of radicalisation (e. g., use of language, behavioural patterns in social networks [...] .) will be designed.

The innovative aspect of this project is to not offer just a methodology on risk assessment, but also a tool that is build based on this methodology, so that the prosecutors, judges, law enforcement and other actors can obtain a short term tangible results.
