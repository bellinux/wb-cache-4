25|$|The {{timing of}} the Jovian {{satellite}} eclipses was also used to calculate an observer's longitude <b>upon</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth.</b> By knowing the expected time when an eclipse would be observed at a standard longitude (such as Greenwich), the time difference could be computed by accurately observing the local time of the eclipse. The time difference gives the longitude of the observer because every hour of difference corresponded to 15° around the Earth's equator. This technique was used, for example, by Giovanni D. Cassini in 1679 to re-map France.|$|E

25|$|Richard Carrington, {{an amateur}} astronomer, moved to Redhill in 1852, {{and built a}} house and observatory. Dome Way, where Redhill's only tower block stands, is named after it.

Here in 1859 he made astronomical observations that first corroborated the existence of solar flares {{as well as their}} electrical influence <b>upon</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> and its aurorae.

In the story mode, Fate confronts Green Arrow and Black Canary in Gorilla City, and they lose to him but manage to take the helmet off, allowing Kent {{to regain control of}} his actions. Kent warns them of an incoming threat towards their planet. After putting the helmet back on, Fate later confronts Batman and Superman in Brainiac's ship. Kent, {{under the influence of the}} helm, believes Brainiac should be allowed to ravage the planet as it would restore order and undo the chaos brought about by Batman and Superman's war. After one of the two defeats him, Superman destroys the helmet, severing Nelson's connection to the Lords of Order. He tries to warn Batman and Superman to stop their feud to prevent the Lords of Order from imposing their will <b>upon</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> before he is impaled and captured by Brainiac.
