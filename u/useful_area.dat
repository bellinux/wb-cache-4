2500|$|New {{design of}} {{anti-bacterial}} medications is of continuing importance in scientific research as bacterial antibiotic resistance to common antibiotics increases. [...] A specific metabolic protein that uses FAD (Complex II) {{is vital for}} bacterial virulence, and so targeting FAD synthesis or creating FAD analogs could be a <b>useful</b> <b>area</b> of investigation. Already, scientists have determined the two structures FAD usually assumes once bound: either an extended or a butterfly conformation, in which the molecule essentially folds in half, resulting in the stacking of the adenine and isoalloxazine rings. [...] FAD imitators {{that are able to}} bind in a similar manner but do not permit protein function could be useful mechanisms of inhibiting bacterial infection. [...] Alternatively, drugs blocking FAD synthesis could achieve the same goal; this is especially intriguing because human and bacterial FAD synthesis relies on very different enzymes, meaning that a drug made to target bacterial FAD synthase would be unlikely to interfere with the human FAD synthase enzymes.|$|E

Further, we know very well about the applications of fractal sets in cryptography and other <b>useful</b> <b>areas</b> in our modern era. In this paper, we deal with generalization of s-convexity, approximate convexity and the results of Bernstein and Doetsch [20]. The concept of s-convexity and rational s-convexity was introduced by Breckner and Orbán [21]. In 1978 Breckner and Orbán [21] and Hudzik and Maligranda [22] proved that s-convex functions are nonnegative when 0 < s < 1; moreover, the set of s-convex functions increases as s decreases.|$|R
