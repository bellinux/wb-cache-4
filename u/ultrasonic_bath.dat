50|$|The third {{method is}} {{microwave}} synthesis of Bioglass, {{which has been}} gaining attention in recent years. Microwave synthesis is a rapid and low-cost powder synthesis method in which precursors are dissolved in water, transferred to an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>bath,</b> and irradiated. The resulting amorphous powder is then filtered, dried at 80 °C, and calcined at 700 °C. The advantages to this technique include the short reaction time {{and the ability to}} modify the reaction environment to produce nano-phase powders.|$|E

50|$|X-rays {{can be used}} to {{chemically}} analyze dinosaur eggshell. This technique requires pure shell samples, so {{the fossil}} must be completely free of its surrounding rock matrix. The shell must then be further cleaned by an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>bath.</b> The sample can then be bombarded by electrons emitted by the same sort of probe used by scanning electron microscopes.

50|$|Grinding is {{abrasion}} of {{the surface}} of interest by abrasive particles, usually diamond, that are bonded to paper or a metal disc. Grinding erases saw marks, coarsely smooths the surface, and removes stock to a desired depth. A typical grinding sequence for ceramics is one minute on a 240-grit metal-bonded diamond wheel rotating at 240 rpm and lubricated by flowing water, followed by a similar treatment on a 400-grit wheel. The specimen is washed in an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>bath</b> after each step.|$|E
50|$|Polishing is {{abrasion}} by free abrasives {{that are}} suspended in a lubricant and can roll or slide between the specimen and paper. Polishing erases grinding marks and smooths the specimen to a mirror-like finish. Polishing on a bare metallic platen is called lapping. A typical polishing sequence for ceramics is 5 - 10 minutes each on 15-, 6- and 1-µm diamond paste or slurry on napless paper rotating at 240 rpm. The specimen is again washed in an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>bath</b> after each step. The {{three sets of}} specimens in Fig. 3 have been sawed, embedded, ground and polished.|$|E
40|$|We report our {{experiences}} {{in the evaluation of}} ultrasonic cleaning processes of objects made with additive manufacturing techniques, specifically three-dimensional (3 D) printers. These objects need to be cleaned of support material added during the printing process. The support material can be removed by dissolution in liquids with or without ultrasonic cavitation. Distinctive stages in the cleaning processes were found for two different liquids (water and NaOH solutions). The combination of ultrasound and high concentration of NaOH has the best results for support material dissolution in the particular conditions studied. The sonication of cleaning processes in <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>baths</b> is typically a slow process. Here we show the advantages of using an ultrasonic horn to clean the surface of small parts and holes more effectively. We introduce a Cleaning Challenge Device design to be used for the universal evaluation of cleaning performance of different equipment or processes, and specifically for <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>baths.</b> The results and conclusions can be of use for different cleaning situations besides 3 D printed parts, such as when deciding which protocol has a better performance or comparing different equipment...|$|R

5000|$|Fast ChIP (qChIP): The fast ChIP assay {{reduced the}} time by {{shortening}} two steps in a typical ChIP assay: (i) an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>bath</b> accelerates the rate of antibody binding to target proteins—and thereby reduces immunoprecipitation time (ii) a resin-based (Chelex-100) DNA isolation procedure reduces the time of cross-link reversal and DNA isolation. However, the fast protocol is suitable only for large cell samples (in the range of 106~107). [...] Up to 24 sheared chromatin samples can be processed to yield PCR-ready DNA in 5 hours, allowing multiple chromatin factors be probed simultaneously and/or looking at genomic events over several time points.|$|E
50|$|Recently {{ultrasonic}} assisted synthesis {{and microwave}} assisted synthesis is gaining attention {{as they can}} help to reaction {{in a short time}} and can modify the reaction environment to produce nano phase powders. It is a rapid and low cost powder synthesis method for powders.For synthesis, the precursors were dissolved in de-ionized water and transferred to the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>bath.</b> The irradiation time was varied to obtain the optimum synthesis condition. Microwave operation was performed in a second batch of powders after the ultrasonic irradiation. The obtained amorphous powder was washed in de-ionized water and filtered.

40|$|AIMS To use a {{sensitive}} forensic test to measure blood contamination of used Siqveland matrix bands following routine cleaning and sterilisation procedures in general dental practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen general dental {{practices in the}} West of Scotland participated. Details of instrument cleaning procedures were recorded for each practice. A total of 133 Siqveland matrix bands were recovered following cleaning and sterilisation and were examined for residual blood contamination by the Kastle-Meyer test, a well-recognised forensic technique. RESULTS: <b>Ultrasonic</b> <b>baths</b> {{were used for the}} cleaning of 62 (47 %) bands and retainers and the remainder (53 %) were hand scrubbed prior to autoclaving. Overall, 21 % of the matrix bands and 19 % of the retainers gave a positive Kastle-Meyer test, indicative of residual blood contamination, following cleaning and sterilisation. In relation to cleaning method, 34 % of hand-scrubbed bands and 32 % of hand-scrubbed retainers were positive for residual blood by the Kastle-Meyer test compared with 6 % and 3 % respectively of ultrasonically cleaned bands and retainers (P less than 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: If Siqveland matrix bands are re-processed in the assembled state, then adequate pre-sterilisation cleaning cannot be achieved reliably. <b>Ultrasonic</b> <b>baths</b> are significantly more effective than hand cleaning for these items of equipment...|$|R

30|$|Once {{the size}} {{clusters}} are {{selected by the}} MesoQ mass filter, they are accelerated by applying a bias voltage (Vb) to a substrate in a high vacuum with a base pressure of 10 - 8 Torr. The nanoparticles were deposited onto silicon wafer. The substrates were cleaned in successive <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>baths</b> of acetone and isopropyl alcohol. The depositions were performed at room temperature without any heating and were applied different bias voltages (3 and 6 kV). The nanoparticle size was controlled by regulating the magnetron power, gas flow (Ar and N 2), and aggregation zone length. These parameters were varied to produce particles of different sizes onto the substrate.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to analyse {{clinically}} failed and retrieved implants prior to and after cleaning by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray induced photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) as compared to unused controls. Six different chemical and physical techniques for cleaning of contaminated titanium implants were evaluated: 1) rinsing in absolute ethanol for 10 min, 2) cleaning in <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>baths</b> containing trichloroethylene (TRI) and absolute ethanol, 10 min in each solution, 3) abrasive cleaning for 30 s, 4) cleaning in supersaturated citric acid for 30 s, 5) cleaning with continuous CO 2 -laser in dry conditions at 5 W for 10 s, 6) cleaning with continuous CO 2 -laser in wet conditions (saline) at 5 W for 10 s. SEM of failed implants showed the presence of contaminants of varying sizes and XPS showed almost no titanium but high carbon signals. XPS of unused titanium implants showed lower levels of titanium as previously reported, probably due to contamination of carbon which increased with time in room air. Cleaning of used implants in citric acid followed by rinsing with deionized water for 5 min followed by cleaning in <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>baths</b> with TRI and absolute ethanol gave the best results with regard to macroscopical appearance and surface composition. However, as compared to the unused implants the results from an element composition point of view were still unsatisfactory. It is concluded that further development and testing of techniques for cleaning of organically contaminated titanium is needed. © Munksgaard 1998. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

30|$|This study {{investigated}} the dispersion stability of functionalized TiO 2 nanoparticles in the transformer oil-based nanofluids, their AC breakdown strength and thermos-physical property, which were prepared through stirring, <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>bath,</b> and probe processes.

40|$|Possible {{drawbacks}} of microreactors are inefficient reactant mixing due to {{the predominance}} of laminar flow and clogging (when solid-forming reactions are performed or solid catalyst suspensions are used).
