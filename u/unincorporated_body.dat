500|$|In Re Finger, Goff J made a {{distinction}} between gifts to incorporated bodies and gifts to unincorporated bodies. When a gift is to an <b>unincorporated</b> <b>body,</b> it must be treated, whatever the wording, {{as a gift to}} that body's purpose. This is because unincorporated bodies cannot possess things. If the body has ceased to exist but the purpose continues, the gift has not failed. Incorporated bodies on the other hand can possess property, and as such, as said by Buckley J in Re Vernon's Will Trust, [...] "A bequest to a corporate body ... takes effect simply as a gift to that body beneficially, unless there are circumstances which show that the recipient is to take the gift as a trustee." ...|$|E
500|$|Failures {{that lead}} to an {{application}} for cy-près are of two sorts; subsequent failure, where the trust, constituted properly, failed {{after a period of}} action, and initial failure, where the trust fails at creation. Subsequent failure cases are designed to have the charity's funds applied to more effective purposes, and as such money already donated to the charity cannot be returned to the next of kin of the original money; in Re Wright, it was said that [...] "once money has been effectually dedicated to charity... the testator's next of kin or residuary legatees are for ever excluded". Schemes for initial failure, on the other hand, ask the court to decide whether the gifts should be returned to the testator's estate and next of kin or be applied to a new purpose under cy-près. When deciding if a gift has failed, there is a distinction made between gifts to unincorporated bodies and incorporated bodies, as laid down in Re Vernon's Will Trust. This is because gifts to an <b>unincorporated</b> <b>body</b> must be treated as gifts to that body's purpose, not to the body itself, since unincorporated bodies cannot hold property. As such, the gift does not revert to the next of kin because even if the body is dissolved, the gift's purpose is (presumably) still valid.|$|E
2500|$|Under Article 6.3 of the FIA Sporting Regulations, [...] "the {{constructor}} of {{an engine}} or chassis {{is the person}} (including any corporate or <b>unincorporated</b> <b>body)</b> which owns the intellectual rights to such engine or chassis". The title of Formula One World Champion Constructor is awarded to the car [...] "make" [...] that has scored the most points {{during the course of}} the season, where a car's make takes into account both engine and chassis. Hence, if a car's chassis and engine constructor are the same entity (e.g. Ferrari, Toyota, BRM etc.) then the make is simply the name of that one constructor. However, where the chassis and engine are constructed by different entities the car's make comprises both (e.g. McLaren-Mercedes, Lotus-Climax etc.), with the name of the chassis constructor being placed before that of the engine constructor. As both engine and chassis are included in the make name, chassis run with different engines (e.g. Lotus-Ford, Lotus-BRM) are counted as two separate makes and points are scored separately. Up until the 1979 season, most seasons saw only the highest-scoring driver in each race for each constructor contributing points towards the World Constructors' Championship. The World Constructors' Championship title is awarded to the constructor of the chassis of the make that scores the most points. For this reason, this list only considers chassis constructors.

2500|$|The German Evangelical Society {{appealed the}} {{decision}} to the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia. [...] It gave three grounds for appeal: 1) That the court in equity had erred in finding the PHC properly incorporated under the 1860 charter; 2) that the court in equity had erred in denying a November 17, 1892, motion to amend the countersuit; and 3) that the court in equity had erred when it found that non-members of the Society were voting members of the PHC. The Court of Appeals, however, dismissed {{the first and third}} grounds. Under the rules of the court, the Society (as appellant) was required to have printed the testimony and proceedings of the initial court. The Society had declined to do so, and the court of appeals concluded that it could not find in favor of the appellant without any printed record. The key question in answering the remaining issue, the court of appeals said, was whether the 1886 entity calling itself the [...] "German Evangelical Society" [...] was, in fact, the same voluntary, <b>unincorporated</b> <b>body</b> which formed the PHC in 1860. The court said it was not and could never be, since {{as a matter of law}} it was a completely new entity. The charter of 1860, as amended, gave no voting rights to any outside organization, only to lotholders. Nor did the charter require lotholders to be members of the German Evangelical Society, whether the society of 1860 or the newly incorporated body of 1886. The court in equity, then, was right in denying the November 17, 1892, motion to amend, for this motion would have given the 1886 body voting rights and standing in the PHC annual meeting. The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the Court of the District of Columbia in Equity on February 5, 1894.|$|E

50|$|A license can be {{terminated}} {{on the death}} of the licensee, the licensee becoming bankrupt, the licensee becoming a patient under the Mental Health Act 1959, a bankruptcy deal under the Bankruptcy Act 1914 in which the license is given to a trustee or a deal under the Deeds of Arrangement Act 1914 in which the licensee's license is handed to a trustee. Such provisions cover both individual, <b>unincorporated</b> <b>bodies</b> and partnerships who are license holders. These provisions do not cover corporate bodies, because following consultations the Government became aware that the liquidation and winding-up of a corporate body would pose problems with licensing, largely because the body continues to trade through a liquidator.|$|R
50|$|In 1932, Larkin helped {{establish}} the Australian Air Convention {{as a means}} of forming national aviation policies. In December 1933, this <b>unincorporated</b> non-governmental <b>body</b> distributed 1,300 copies of a circular, including one mailed to Shepherd's successor, Sir George Pearce.

5000|$|The failure caused little initial {{surprise}} {{or anger}} as shop floor Convenor and Pensions Trustee Bob Duncan had long assured workers that {{whatever happened to}} the Company their pensions were safe. Unfortunately and unknown to Duncan, the official advice on which this was based on simply wasn't true. As one of four Judicial Review litigants, Duncan played a key part in Dr Ros Altmann’s eventually successful Pensionstheft campaign. Invited to give evidence before the Public Administration Select Committee, Duncan blamed the government’s misleading information. The Committee agreed. Once the Independent Trustee revealed {{the full extent of the}} pension loss in January 2002, Apax’s alleged role in the collapse of the company came under scrutiny. Three separate complaints were made, all rejected on the grounds of jurisdiction leading Dr Ashok Kumar MP to tell Parliament that [...] "Some serious joined-up thinking is needed on all these issues". [...] Duncan complained to OPRA but this organisation at that time could only investigate alleged wrongdoing by Trustees and notoriously lacked effectiveness The regulator did say that the complaint contained information which [...] "might be of interest to the DTI" [...] though a dossier submitted via Patricia Hewitt under Section 447 the Companies Act 1985 was rejected as the DTI could not investigate <b>unincorporated</b> <b>bodies</b> such as pension schemes, an investigation was unlikely to be effective, and complaints were best handled by the Pensions Ombudsman.|$|R
40|$|Part 1 of the Finance Act (1909 - 10) {{introduced}} {{a series of}} duties on land including a 20 % tax on {{the increase in the}} incremental value of land. This was payable on its transfer, sale or lease or on the death of the owner. Corporate and <b>unincorporated</b> <b>bodies</b> were to pay the tax every fifteenth years and there was to be a tax of 0. 2 % per annum on the capital value of unimproved land where building had been held back for speculative purposes. These new taxes required the creation of a fiscal cadastre in order to provide a definitive valuation of each piece of land on a specific date as a baseline against which subsequent increases in value could be measured and taxes levied. This was the first national fiscal cadastre for the UK compiled by professional valuers using modern valuation techniques. The paper examines how the fiscal cadastre was compiled, including the organisation that had to be created for the purpose. In the event the duties were never collected. Political changes brought to power a government that was opposed to the duties and they were abolished, but not until after the fiscal cadastre had been created. The UK does not have a general cadastre and at that time did not have compulsory land registration. The study of how the fiscal cadastre was created helps to identify which were the preconditions that supported it. In drawing up the fiscal cadastr...|$|R

50|$|The CCF is an <b>unincorporated</b> <b>body</b> {{established}} by a management company {{under which the}} participants by contractual arrangements participate and share in {{the property of the}} fund as co-owners (specifically tenants in common). It is modelled on the Luxembourg Fonds commun de placement or FCP structure. Although the CCF could only be established as a UCITS when it was originally introduced in 2003, a non UCITS CCF can now be established pursuant to the Investment Funds, Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2005, which was enacted in June 2005.|$|E
5000|$|... "Individual" [...] {{is defined}} as {{including}} a partnership or other <b>unincorporated</b> <b>body,</b> but not corporations registered at Companies House or created by an Act of Parliament or Royal Charter, such as the BBC. The definition also excludes [...] "corporations sole", such as certain government ministers and bishops. Under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965, industrial and provident societies are considered corporate bodies and thus excluded from the Act, but friendly societies and trade unions are unincorporated and thus qualify. In contrast, however, the definition of [...] "person" [...] includes both individuals and incorporated bodies.|$|E
50|$|The CCF is {{constituted}} {{under contract}} law by a deed (called a deed of constitution). The {{parties to the}} deed of constitution are the management company and the custodian, and the deed is executed under seal. The assets of the CCF will be entrusted to a custodian for safekeeping {{in the same manner}} as applies in the case of other funds authorised by the Central Bank of Ireland. As an <b>unincorporated</b> <b>body,</b> the CCF will not have separate legal personality. As a co-owner, each investor will hold an undivided co-ownership interest as a tenant in common with the other investors.|$|E
50|$|Holders of {{a license}} {{are obliged to}} inform the Director General {{when there is a}} change made within the office of a {{corporate}} licensee, an <b>unincorporated</b> <b>body</b> or a partnership. This must be done within 21 days of the change occurring. Details of new licenses are published in the Consumer Credit Bulletin, the weekly journal of the Office of Fair Trading. A license lasts for 3 years beginning with the date specified on the license, not the date of its issue. A person who engages in activities that require a license when he does not have one commits a criminal offence. In addition, those agreements he makes are considered unenforceable unless the Director General directly intercedes.|$|E

5000|$|In most Australian {{states and}} territories, a similar set of laws allows not-for-profit {{associations}} to become legal entities with {{a limit to}} the liability of their members. An {{example of such a}} law, the Associations Incorporation Act that is in force in South Australia, allows {{for the creation of a}} legal entity able to buy and sell land and in general, enter into legally binding contracts. [...] Many clubs and societies begin life as an <b>unincorporated</b> <b>body</b> and seek to attain incorporated status to protect its members from legal liability and in many cases to seek government financial assistance only available to an incorporated body. Clubs and societies wishing to incorporate must meet the provisions of the relevant state act and lodge their constitution with the corresponding state government authority.|$|E
5000|$|Worldcon, or more {{formally}} The World Science Fiction Convention, is {{a science}} fiction convention that has been held each year since 1939 (except for the years 1942 through 1945, during World War II). It is the annual convention of the World Science Fiction Society (or WSFS), an <b>unincorporated</b> <b>body</b> whose members are defined as [...] "all people who have paid membership dues to the Committee of the current Worldcon" [...] (i.e., that are either upcoming or currently under way). These members of WSFS vote both to select {{the site of the}} Worldcon two years in advance and to select the winners of the Hugo Awards, which are presented at the convention.

5000|$|The 2007 Super Aguri {{is based}} on a re-worked RA106 chassis used by Honda F1 in the 2006 Formula One season. It has been the basis of a {{complaint}} filed by Spyker F1 against Super Aguri F1. [...] It is believed that the protest is related to articles 2.1, 2.2 and 6.3 of the F1 sporting regulations. [...] Article 6.3 of the F1 sporting regulations states: [...] "The constructor of an engine or rolling chassis is the person (including any corporate or <b>unincorporated</b> <b>body)</b> which owns the intellectual property rights to such engine or chassis." [...] Since Super Aguri owns the intellectual property rights, they claim that the car is within the rules. Indeed, the Honda F1 RA106 was sold to PJUU Inc, and Super Aguri F1 acquired the rights through them and thereafter modified the package to meet the technical regulations for the 2007 season.|$|E
5000|$|There is {{also another}} {{issue of the}} team's {{possible}} violation of the Concorde Agreement. Both Spyker and Williams claim that Super Aguri (and both Red Bull teams) have broken Schedule 3 of the Agreement which states: [...] "A constructor is a person (including any incorporated or <b>unincorporated</b> <b>body)</b> who owns the intellectual property rights to the rolling chassis it currently races, and does not incorporate in such chassis any part designed or manufactured by any other constructor of F1 racing cars except for standard items of safety equipment, providing that nothing in the Schedule 3 shall prevent {{the use of an}} engine or gearbox manufactured by a person other than the constructor of the chassis." [...] Spyker and Williams believe that if the SA07 does indeed use components designed by Honda, they would be in violation of the Concorde Agreement. The issue is yet to be clarified and the FIA will not be permitted to take action against a team curtailing the Concorde Agreement until the issue has been resolved in a court of law. Super Aguri maintains their innocence in this issue, though the matter is still of great contention.|$|E
