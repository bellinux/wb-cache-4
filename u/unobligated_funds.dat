40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act of 1990 (CARE Act), administered by the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), was enacted {{to address the needs}} of jurisdictions, health care providers, and people with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) and their family members. In December 2006 the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Modernization Act of 2006 reauthorized CARE Act programs for fiscal years 2007 through 2009. In July 2007, the House of Representatives passed H. R. 3043, the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2008, which contains a hold-harmless provision covering funding for urban areas that receive funding under the CARE Act. This bill has not been passed by the Senate. Under the CARE Act, funding for Eligible Metropolitan Areas (EMA) and Transitional Grant Areas (TGA) is primarily provided through three categories of grants: (1) formula grants that are awarded based on the case counts of people with HIV/AIDS living in an urban area; (2) supplemental grants that are awarded on a competitive basis based on an urban area's demonstration of need, including criteria such as HIV/AIDS prevalence; and (3) Minority AIDS Initiative (MAI) grants, which are supplemental grants awarded on a competitive basis for urban areas to address disparities in access, treatment, care, and health outcomes. The CARE Act includes a hold-harmless provision that limited the decrease that an EMA could receive in its formula funding for fiscal year 2007 to 5 percent of the fiscal year 2006 formula funding it would have received if the revised urban area allocations required by the Modernization Act of 2006 had been in place in fiscal year 2006. For fiscal years 2008 and 2009, the hold-harmless provision provides that an EMA will receive at least 100 percent of the amount of its formula funding for fiscal year 2007. However, no limitation applies to the decrease in total formula, supplemental, and MAI funding that an EMA can receive. As Congress considers appropriations for CARE Act programs for fiscal year 2008, on July 27, 2007, and September 11, 2007, Congress asked us to (1) provide historical information on the funding levels identified during the appropriations process for CARE Act grants to urban areas as compared to fiscal year 2008 CARE Act funding levels proposed as part of the fiscal year 2008 appropriations process in the House of Representatives; (2) examine how the proposed hold-harmless provision from H. R. 3043 would impact funding for urban areas under the proposed funding levels; (3) determine whether any urban areas receive funding based on the number of both living and deceased HIV/AIDS cases; (4) provide sources that address the amount of CARE Act <b>funding</b> <b>unobligated</b> by urban areas, states, and territories; and (5) provide sources that address the number of people on AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) waiting lists. ...|$|R

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "DOD has identified DAWDF as a key tool used to address gaps in the acquisition workforce through additional hiring and training initiatives. For example, DOD officials noted they used DAWDF funds to hire about 5, 855 new acquisition staff through fiscal year 2011 and enabled the Defense Acquisition University to provide 19, 000 additional classroom seats, among other improvements. However, DODs ability to effectively execute hiring and other initiatives has been hindered by delays in the DAWDF funding process {{and the absence of}} clear guidance on the availability and use of related funds.

40|$|Westinghouse Savannah River Company (Westinghouse) is {{responsible}} for managing the Department of Energy`s (Department) surplus facilities at the Savannah River Site (Site). In Fiscal Year (FY) 1996, the Site had 162 surplus facilities and anticipated that 118 more would become surplus within the next 5 years. The objective of this audit {{was to determine whether}} the Savannah River Operations Office (Operations Office) and Westinghouse had economically and promptly deactivated, decontaminated, and disposed of surplus facilities at the Site. Departmental regulations require that surplus facilities be deactivated, decontaminated, and disposed of economically and promptly. However, Westinghouse only disposed of one facility and did not completely deactivate or decontaminate any of the 162 facilities identified as surplus at the Site in FY 1996. This occurred because the Operations Office did not compile a Site-wide list, establish priorities, or provide sufficient funding for the deactivation, decontamination, and disposal of surplus facilities. As a result, the Department incurred unnecessary costs for the surveillance and maintenance of surplus facilities. For example, the Department could have avoided annual costs of about $ 1. 3 million in surveillance and maintenance costs by spending $ 1. 2 million to perform a deactivation project on the P-Reactor process-water storage tanks. The Operations Office could have funded the project out of its unobligated FY 1996 operating funds. However, it returned the <b>unobligated</b> <b>funds</b> to the Department`s Headquarters {{at the end of the}} fiscal year.

40|$|This {{report has}} been {{prepared}} to closeout a NASA grant to Mississippi State University (MSU) for research into situation awareness (SA) and automation in the advanced commercial aircraft cockpit. The grant was divided into two obligations including $ 60, 000 for the period from May 11, 2000 to December 25, 2000. The information presented in this report summarizes work completed through this obligation. It also details work to be completed with {{the balance of the}} current obligation and <b>unobligated</b> <b>funds</b> amounting to $ 50, 043, which are to be granted to North Carolina State University for completion of the research project from July 31, 2000 to May 10, 2001. This research was to involve investigation of a broad spectrum of degrees of automation of complex systems on human-machine performance and SA. The work was to empirically assess the effect of theoretical levels of automation (LOAs) described in a taxonomy developed by Endsley & Kaber (1999) on naive and experienced subject performance and SA in simulated flight tasks. The study was to be conducted {{in the context of a}} realistic simulation of aircraft flight control. The objective of this work was to identify LOAs that effectively integrate humans and machines under normal operating conditions and failure modes. In general, the work was to provide insight into the design of automation in the commercial aircraft cockpit. Both laboratory and field investigations were to be conducted. At this point in time, a high-fidelity flight simulator of the McDonald Douglas (MD) 11 aircraft has been completed. The simulator integrates a reconfigurable flight simulator developed by the Georgia Institute of Technology and stand-alone simulations of MD- 11 autoflight systems developed at MSU. Use of the simulator has been integrated into a study plan for the laboratory research and it is expected that the simulator will also be used in the field study with actual commercial pilots. In addition to the flight simulator, an electronic version of the Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT) has been completed for measuring commercial pilot SA in flight tasks. The SAGAT is to be used in both the lab and field studies. Finally, the lab study has been designed and subjects have been recruited for participation in experiments. This study will investigate the effects of five levels of automation, described in Endsley & Kaber's (1999) taxonomy and applied to the MD- 11 autoflight system, on private pilot performance and SA in basic flight tasks by using the MD- 11 simulator. The field study remains to be planned and executed...|$|E
40|$|Remote {{artisanal fishing}} {{communities}} {{in the developing world}} remain highly dependent on declining marine resources. Despite this, many internationally funded fisheries development projects seek to increase catch rates and commercialise artisanal fisheries as part of livelihood development projects. Such an approach tends to increase pressure on local fisheries and contribute to further declines in fish stocks. In order to mitigate this negative outcome, the integration of a supplemental livelihood such as marine tourism has been suggested. This approach {{is based on the assumption}} that participation in the tourism sector has the potential to benefit both the resource and those dependent on the resource. This research investigated the perspectives and knowledge of members of three remote fishing communities in two areas of the northern region of Luzon, Philippines. This exploratory qualitative project utilised phenomenological inquiry as the main research instrument. Perception-­based data that focused on livelihood satisfaction, perceptions of the current state of marine resources, tourism awareness and willingness to engage in tourism as a livelihood diversification were collected from 42 fisherfolk via face to face interviews. Additional information was gathered from five key informants that represented key stakeholders, including local and foreign tour operators, NGOs, international aid agencies and fisheries management at the government level. More specifically, key informants were asked to identify costs and benefits of tourism as a livelihood diversification strategy as well as provide examples of its application. This research revealed that the fisherfolk participants were generally satisfied with their current livelihoods and, therefore, did not express a desire to shift livelihoods. This sentiment appears to be a result of currently being able to 'make ends meet', albeit through resource overexploitation and the use of illegal fishing methods. Further, key findings, primarily the gross under awareness of tourism within remote artisanal fishing communities, suggested that the current approach to tourism development requires modification. However, the high social value associated with the idea of receiving visitors by fisherfolk enforced the viability of tourism as a diversification strategy. Most importantly, the data from two key informants documented two potential successful surf-riding tourism development projects from the private sector that have worked to engage fisherfolk in the tourism sector. Elements from these modes were combined to suggest a contributory tourism development model based on social entrepreneurship and resource conservation components. This new model proposes the privatisation of livelihood diversification through small-scale tourism development in the context of fisheries. In light of the suggested privatisation, it is further recommended that direct conservation and enforcement of the resource be prioritised with the resulting <b>unobligated</b> <b>funds</b> from international aid efforts. The application of the suggested model aims to significantly reduce the current development project timelines and budgets, provide growth in the private sector through social entrepreneurship, provide accessible diversification opportunities for fisherfolk and provide a conservation strategy for the natural resources, and thus, provide long-term protection for the dependent communities...|$|E
