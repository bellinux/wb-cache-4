5|$|Another {{quantum effect}} that predicts the {{occurrence}} of faster-than-light speeds is called the Hartman effect; <b>under</b> <b>certain</b> conditions the time needed for a virtual particle to tunnel through a barrier is constant, regardless of {{the thickness of the}} barrier. This could result in a virtual particle crossing a large gap faster-than-light. However, no information can be sent using this effect.|$|E
5|$|Around the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, it was found that <b>under</b> <b>certain</b> conditions a fast-moving charged particle caused a condensation of supersaturated water vapor along its path. In 1911, Charles Wilson used this principle to devise his cloud chamber so he could photograph the tracks of charged particles, such as fast-moving electrons.|$|E

Six forms of external tapas are—fasting, control of appetite, accepting food <b>under</b> <b>certain</b> conditions, renunciation of delicious food, sitting and sleeping in lonely place and renunciation of comforts. Six forms of internal tapas are—atonement, reverence, rendering of service to worthy ones, spiritual study, avoiding selfish feelings and meditation.|$|E
5|$|Russell {{argues that}} naked power arises within a {{government}} <b>under</b> <b>certain</b> social conditions: when {{two or more}} fanatical creeds are contending for governance, and when all traditional beliefs have decayed.

5|$|Some {{antioxidant}} supplements may promote {{disease and}} increase mortality in humans <b>under</b> <b>certain</b> conditions. Hypothetically, free radicals induce an endogenous response that protects against exogenous radicals (and possibly other toxic compounds). Free radicals may increase life span. This increase may be prevented by antioxidants, providing direct evidence that toxic radicals may mitohormetically exert life extending and health promoting effects.|$|E

5|$|The Brander–Spencer {{model is}} an {{economic}} model in international trade originally developed by James Brander and Barbara Spencer in the early 1980s. The model illustrates a situation where, <b>under</b> <b>certain</b> assumptions, a government can subsidize domestic firms to help them in their competition against foreign producers {{and in doing so}} enhances national welfare. This conclusion stands in contrast to results from most international trade models, in which government non-interference is socially optimal.|$|E

5|$|Unlike the {{warships}} of Antiquity, Byzantine and Arab ships did not feature rams, and {{the primary}} means of ship-to-ship combat were boarding actions and missile fire, {{as well as the}} use of inflammable materials such as Greek fire.

Despite an eventual compromise allowing patient lawsuits to go to state courts <b>under</b> <b>certain</b> circumstances and heavy lobbying in favor of Fletcher's bill by President George W.

5|$|As {{a spiritual}} {{successor}} to Rare's 1997 hit GoldenEye 007, Perfect Dark shares many gameplay similarities with its predecessor and runs on a upgraded {{version of its}} engine. The game features a single-player mode that requires players to complete a series of missions <b>under</b> <b>certain</b> difficulty settings. It also features a range of multiplayer options, including a co-operative mode and traditional deathmatch settings. Perfect Dark was developed {{over the course of}} three years and is technically one of the most advanced games for the Nintendo 64, offering an optional high resolution graphics mode, widescreen support, and Dolby's surround sound. A Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak is required to access the game's single-player mode and most of the multiplayer features.|$|E
5|$|Church {{belief in}} {{the resurrection of the}} body led to a {{prohibition}} against cremation that was pastorally modified at the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s under limited circumstances, but those conditions have been largely ignored even by the clergy. According to the Catechism, burial of the dead is a corporal work of mercy that must treat the body with respect and love (e.g. scattering of cremated remains, burial in an unmarked grave, etc. are forbidden in the Catholic Church). Organ donation after death and organ transplants <b>under</b> <b>certain</b> terms, also autopsies for legal and scientific reasons are permitted.|$|E
