5|$|Like other pterosaurs, Pteranodon {{probably}} {{took off}} from a standing, quadrupedal position. Using their long forelimbs for leverage, they would have vaulted themselves into the air in a rapid leap. Almost all of the energy would have been generated by the forelimbs. The <b>upstroke</b> of the wings would have occurred when the animal cleared the ground followed by a rapid down-stroke to generate additional lift and complete the launch into the air.|$|E
5|$|As in {{the wings}} of modern birds, the flight {{feathers}} of Archaeopteryx were somewhat asymmetrical and the tail feathers were rather broad. This implies that the wings and tail were used for lift generation, but {{it is unclear whether}} Archaeopteryx was capable of flapping flight or simply a glider. The lack of a bony breastbone suggests that Archaeopteryx was not a very strong flier, but flight muscles might have attached to the thick, boomerang-shaped wishbone, the platelike coracoids, or perhaps, to a cartilaginous sternum. The sideways orientation of the glenoid (shoulder) joint between scapula, coracoid, and humerus—instead of the dorsally angled arrangement found in modern birds—may indicate that Archaeopteryx was unable to lift its wings above its back, a requirement for the <b>upstroke</b> found in modern flapping flight. According to a study by Philip Senter in 2006, Archaeopteryx was indeed unable to use flapping flight as modern birds do, but it may well have used a downstroke-only flap-assisted gliding technique.|$|E
5|$|The {{wings of}} bats are much thinner and consist of more bones {{than that of}} birds, {{allowing}} bats to maneuver more accurately and fly with more lift and less drag. By folding the wings inwards towards their body on the <b>upstroke,</b> they use 35% less energy during flight than birds. The membranes are delicate, ripping easily; however, the tissue of the bat's membrane is able to regrow, such that small tears can heal quickly. The surface of their wings is equipped with touch-sensitive receptors on small bumps called Merkel cells, also found on human fingertips. These sensitive areas are different in bats, as each bump has a tiny hair in the center, making it even more sensitive and allowing the bat to detect and collect information about the air flowing over its wings, and to fly more efficiently by changing the shape of its wings in response.|$|E

5|$|The {{wings of}} bats are much thinner and consist of more bones than {{the wings of}} birds, {{allowing}} bats to maneuver more accurately than the latter, and fly with more lift and less drag. By folding the wings in toward their bodies on the <b>upstroke,</b> they save 35 percent energy during flight. The membranes are also delicate, ripping easily; however, the tissue of the bat's membrane is able to regrow, such that small tears can heal quickly. The surface of their wings is equipped with touch-sensitive receptors on small bumps called Merkel cells, also found on human fingertips. These sensitive areas are different in bats, as each bump has a tiny hair in the center, making it even more sensitive and allowing the bat to detect and adapt to changing airflow; the primary use is to judge what the most efficient speed to fly at is, and possibly also to avoid stalls. Insectivorous bats may also use tactile hairs while performing complex manouvres while attempting to capture prey in-flight.|$|E
25|$|Since {{there are}} two wing strokes (the <b>upstroke</b> and downstroke) in each cycle of the wing movement, the kinetic energy is 2×43=86erg. This is about {{as much energy as}} is {{consumed}} in hovering itself.|$|E

25|$|WPW is {{commonly}} diagnosed {{on the basis}} of the electrocardiogram in an asymptomatic individual. In this case, it is manifested as a delta wave, which is a slurred <b>upstroke</b> in the QRS complex that is associated with a short PR interval. The short PR interval and slurring of the QRS complex are actually the impulse making it through to the ventricles prematurely (across the accessory pathway) without the usual delay experienced in the AV node.|$|E
25|$|In {{individuals}} with WPW, electrical {{activity that is}} initiated in the SA node travels through the accessory pathway, {{as well as through}} the AV node to activate the ventricles via both pathways. Since the accessory pathway does not have the impulse slowing properties of the AV node, the electrical impulse first activates the ventricles via the accessory pathway, and immediately afterwards via the AV node. This gives the short PR interval and slurred <b>upstroke</b> of the QRS complex known as the delta wave.|$|E
25|$|Aconitine can {{interact}} with the voltage-dependent sodium-ion channels, which are proteins in the cell membranes of excitable tissues, such as cardiac and skeletal muscles and neurons. These proteins are highly selective for sodium ions. They open very fast to depolarize the cell membrane potential, causing the <b>upstroke</b> of an action potential. Normally, the sodium channels close very rapidly, but the depolarization of the membrane potential causes the opening (activation) of potassium channels and potassium efflux, which results in repolarization of the membrane potential.|$|E

25|$|Several {{contrary}} {{claims have}} been made against that the flight capabilities of Confuciusornis. The first of these regarded problems to attain a steep flight path due to a limited wing amplitude. In Senter's {{of the position of}} the shoulder joint, a normal <b>upstroke</b> would be impossible precluding flapping flight entirely. Less radical is the assessment that {{due to the lack of}} a keeled sternum and a high acrocoracoid, the Musculus pectoralis minor could not serve as a M. supracoracoideus lifting the humerus via a tendon running through a foramen triosseum. This, coupled with a limited <b>upstroke</b> caused by a lateral position of the shoulder joint, would have made it difficult to gain altitude. Some authors therefore proposed that Confuciusornis used its large thumb claws to climb tree trunks. Martin assumed that it could raise its torso almost vertically like a squirrel. Daniel Hembree however, while acknowledging that tree climbing was likely, pointed out that the rump was apparently not lifted more than 25° relative to the femur in vertical position, as shown by the location of the antitrochanter in the hip joint. Dieter S. Peters considered it very unlikely that Confuciusornis climbed trunks as turning the thumb claw inwards would stretch the very long wing forwards, right in the path of obstructing branches. Peters sees Confuciusornis as capable of flapping flight but specialised in soaring flight.|$|E
25|$|Confuciusornis has {{traditionally}} been assumed {{to have been a}} competent flier based on its extremely long wings with strongly asymmetrical feathers. Other adaptations for improved flight capabilities include: a fused wrist, a short tail, an ossified sternum with a central keel, a strut-like coracoid, a large deltopectoral crest, a strong ulna and an enlarged second metacarpal. The sternal keel and deltopectoral crest (which provides a more powerful <b>upstroke)</b> are adaptations to flapping flight in modern birds, indicating that Confuciusornis may have been capable of the same. However, it may have had a different flight stroke due to being incapable of rotating its arm behind the body, and its relatively smaller sternal keel indicates that it likely was not capable of flight for extended periods of time.|$|E
25|$|Another {{interesting}} {{feature of}} insect flight {{is the body}} tilt. As flight speed increases, the insect body tends to tilt nose-down and become more horizontal. This reduces the frontal area and therefore, the body drag. Since drag also increases as forward velocity increases, the insect is making its flight more efficient as this efficiency becomes more necessary. Additionally, by changing the geometric angle of attack on the downstroke, the insect is able to keep its flight at an optimal efficiency through as many manoeuvres as possible. The development of general thrust is relatively small compared with lift forces. Lift forces {{may be more than}} three times the insect's weight, while thrust at even the highest speeds may be as low as 20% of the weight. This force is developed primarily through the less powerful <b>upstroke</b> of the flapping motion.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Unidirectional {{conduction}} block (UCB) and reentry {{may occur}} {{as a consequence of}} an abrupt tissue expansion and a related change in the electrical load. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate critical dimensions of the tissue necessary for establishing UCB in heart cell culture. Methods: Neonatal rat heart cell cultures with cell strands of variable width emerging into a large cell area were grown using a technique of patterned cell growth. Action potential <b>upstrokes</b> were measured using a voltage sensitive dye (RH- 237) and a linear array of 10 photodiodes with a 15 μm resolution. A mathematical model was used to relate action potential wave shapes to underlying ionic currents. Results: UCB (block of a single impulse in anterograde direction — from a strand to a large area — and conduction in the retrograde direction) occurred in narrow cell strands with a width of 15 (SD 4) μm (1 - 2 cells in width, n = 7) and there was no conduction block in strands with a width of 31 (8) μm (n = 9, P < 0. 001) or larger. The analysis of action potential waveshapes indicated that conduction block was either due to geometrical expansion alone (n = 5) or to additional local depression of conduction (n = 2). In wide strands, action potential <b>upstrokes</b> during anterograde conduction were characterised by multiple rising phases. Mathematical modelling showed that two rising phases were caused by electronic current flow, whereas local ionic current did not coincide with the rising portions of the <b>upstrokes.</b> Conclusions: (1) High resolution optical mapping shows multiphasic action potential <b>upstrokes</b> at the region of abrupt expansion. At the site of the maximum decrement in conduction, these peaks were largely determined by the electrotonus and not by the local ionic current. (2) Unidirectional conduction block occurred in strands with a width of 15 (4) μm (1 - 2 cells...|$|R
25|$|The wing-assisted incline running (WAIR) {{hypothesis}} {{was prompted by}} observation of young chukar chicks, and proposes that wings developed their aerodynamic functions {{as a result of}} the need to run quickly up very steep slopes such as tree trunks, for example to escape from predators. This makes it a specialized type of cursorial ("from the ground up") theory. Note that in this scenario birds need downforce to give their feet increased grip. But early birds, including Archaeopteryx, lacked the shoulder mechanism by which modern birds' wings produce swift, powerful <b>upstrokes.</b> Since the downforce WAIR depends on is generated by <b>upstrokes,</b> it seems that early birds were incapable of WAIR. Because WAIR is a behavioural trait without osteological specializations, the phylogenetic placement of the flight stroke before the divergence of Neornithes makes it impossible to determine if WAIR is ancestral to the avian flight stroke or derived from it.|$|R
25|$|Insects gain kinetic energy, {{provided}} by the muscles, when they accelerate. When the wings begin to decelerate {{toward the end of}} the stroke, this energy must dissipate. During the downstroke, the kinetic energy is dissipated by the muscles themselves and is converted into heat (this heat is sometimes used to maintain core body temperature). Some insects are able to utilize the kinetic energy in the upward movement of the wings to aid in their flight. The wing joints of these insects contain a pad of elastic, rubber-like protein called resilin. During the <b>upstroke</b> of the wing, the resilin is stretched. The kinetic energy of the wing is converted into potential energy in the stretched resilin, which stores the energy much like a spring. When the wing moves down, this energy is released and aids in the downstroke.|$|E
25|$|In Robinson's model, {{both the}} {{downstroke}} and the <b>upstroke</b> {{would have been}} powerful. In 1982, she was criticised by Samuel Tarsitano, Eberhard Frey and Jürgen Riess, who claimed that, while the muscles at {{the underside of the}} shoulder and pelvic plates were clearly powerful enough to pull the limbs downwards, comparable muscle groups on the top of these plates to elevate the limbs were simply lacking, and, had they been present, could not have been forcefully employed, their bulging carrying the danger of hurting the internal organs. They proposed a more limited flying model in which a powerful downstroke was combined with a largely unpowered recovery, the flipper returning to its original position by the momentum of the forward moving and temporarily sinking body. This modified flying model became a popular interpretation. Less attention was given to an alternative hypothesis by Stephen Godfrey in 1984, which proposed that both the forelimbs and hindlimbs performed a deep paddling motion to the rear combined with a powered recovery stroke to the front, resembling the movement made by the forelimbs of sea-lions.|$|E
25|$|Fossils of Confuciusornis {{show that}} it had an {{exceptionally}} large humerus (upper arm bone). Near its shoulder-end this was equipped with a prominent deltopectoral crest. Characteristically this crista deltopectoralis was with Confuciusornis pierced by an oval hole which may have reduced the bone's weight or enlarged the attachment area of the flight miscles. The furcula or wishbone, like that of Archaeopteryx, was a simple curved bar lacking a pointed process at the back, a hypocleidum. The sternum (breastbone) was relatively broad and had a low keel which was raised at the back end. This bony keel {{may or may not}} have anchored a larger, cartilaginous, keel for enlarged pectoral muscles. The scapulae (shoulder blades) were fused to the strut-like coracoid bones and may have formed a solid base for the attachment of wing muscles. The orientation of the shoulder joint was sideways, instead of angled upward as in modern birds; this means that Confuciusornis was unable to lift its wings high above its back. According to a study by Phil Senter in 2006, the joint was even pointed largely downwards meaning that the humerus could not be lifted above the horizontal. This would make Confuciusornis incapable of the <b>upstroke</b> required for flapping flight; the same would have been true for Archaeopteryx.|$|E

50|$|Digital imaging {{velocimetry}} {{was used}} to capture rufous hummingbird wing movements on film, enabling determination that the bird supports its body weight during hovering primarily by wing downstrokes (75% of lift) rather than by <b>upstrokes</b> (25% of lift).
