5000|$|In {{the realm}} of the United Kingdom {{unsolicited}} goods are goods delivered to an individual with a view to the individual acquiring them, but where the individual has no reasonable cause to believe that they were delivered for legitimate business and had not previously agreed to acquire them. These were regulated under the Unsolicited Goods Act 1971 but the Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000 are stricter in every respect rendering the 1971 Act largely redundant from a consumer law perspective, although there is no express repeal. However the said distance selling regulations only apply to consumers so a business receiving the goods on an unsolicited basis would {{need to look at the}} 1971 Act. Also with effect from 14 June 2014 the distance regulations are replaced by The Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 which include a new s 29A added to the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 making it clear the consumer may keep unsolicited goods. The 2008 regulations prohibit as a criminal offence various <b>unfair</b> <b>advertising</b> and marketing practices and in paragraph 29 of Schedule 1 make it a criminal offence to engage in [...] "Demanding immediate or deferred payment for or the return or safekeeping of products supplied by the trader, but not solicited by the consumer, except where the product is a substitute supplied in accordance with regulation 19(7) of the Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000 (inertia selling)".|$|E
5000|$|In December, 1942, {{announcement}} {{was made of the}} sale of Winter Street Corp., the holding company for Shepard family interests, to General Tire and Rubber for $1.24 million. Winter Street was the corporate parent of the Yankee Network Inc. which owned the Colonial Network and four AM and two FM stations. Winter Street was controlled by trusts set up for two of the children of founder John Shephard Jr., John Shephard III, general manager of WNAC and Yankee, and Robert Shephard, who managed the family's remaining department store in Providence. The transactions, and the closing of the Shepard Stores location in Boston, were viewed as a strategy to convert the elder Shepard's assets to cash. John Shepard III remained with the station as general manager under a five-year contract. Later that same month, the FCC approved the transaction after securing an affidavit from General Tire's president that [...] "no better deal" [...] would be offered the tire company to buy [...] "time, facilities and services" [...] on Yankee Network stations, and that General Tire would [...] "never" [...] use its ownership to gain an <b>unfair</b> <b>advertising</b> advantage over competitors. Some 40 years later, the company was forced to exit broadcasting for reasons including illegal reciprocal trade agreements. In addition to WNAC and the two networks. the sale included WEAN, Providence; WAAB, Worcester; WICC, Bridgeport, Conn. and experimental FM stations in Paxton, Massachusetts and Mt.

40|$|The {{subject of}} my {{doctoral}} thesis is {{the analysis of}} the judicial treatment of <b>unfair</b> <b>advertising.</b> The aim of the thesis is to offer a systematic outlook on the legal environment of advertising from a private and a public law perspective. The legal definition of advertising is given in the Advertising Regulation Act, which can be regarded as the most important public act governing <b>unfair</b> <b>advertising</b> and in the Act on the Operation of Radio and Television Broadcasting, which regulates advertising in television, radio and internet broadcasting. All these definitions belong to the public law area. On the other hand, the definition of unfairness {{can be found in a}} private law act, namely in the Commercial Code (Act No. 513 / 1991 Coll.). The unfairness of competition (indirectly of <b>unfair</b> <b>advertising</b> as well) is defined with a general clause against unfair competition. As a result of these definitions, <b>unfair</b> <b>advertising</b> could be understood as the activity, which fulfils the legal definition of advertising and at the same time fulfils the general clause against unfair competition. The thesis consists of three extensive chapters. The first chapter describes the history of <b>unfair</b> <b>advertising</b> and the current legal regulation of this subject from an international, a European and a national perspective.

40|$|A {{competitive}} marketplace for goods, {{services and}} associated credit {{is in no}} small measure dependent upon the existence of adequately informed consumers. Consumers who are ignorant of the full nature, quantity and price of items sold, or credit available, in the market cannot make a rational purchasing decision. Chapter I endeavours to place the topic of consumer information in socio-economic perspective, considers the necessity for government intervention in the marketplace and outlines basic objectives of consumer protection legislation. Chapter II is devoted to business self regulation with emphasis being placed upon the codes of advertising practice. While it is recognised that self regulatory schemes exhibit considerable potential to advance the consumer interest, self regulatory codes of conduct and practice suffer through incomplete subscription to such codes and through inadequate sanctions for enforcement. This dictates that self regulation alone is not enough and that legislative intervention and control is essential. The consumer is accorded a comprehensive and diverse bundle of rights by statute and at common law and Chapter III examines {{the nature and extent of}} the consumer's remedies as against an advertiser, seller, etc. Given the dependence of substantive rights on procedural rights, it is argued that the real measure of benefit conferred lies in the ease of implementation of these rights, or otherwise. Consideration is given to small claims tribunals as important low cost forums for the settlement of disputes and to class and representative actions. Chapter IV discusses statutory control of advertising in New Zealand and liberal reference is made to the regulation of advertising in the United States where considerable development has occured in the fields of corrective advertising and advertisement substantiation. It is suggested that New Zealand could benefit by the promulgation of rules designed to achieve these ends. Furthermore, it is pointed out that control over the genus of <b>unfair</b> <b>advertising</b> is at best partial and it is suggested that the legislature take appropriate steps to remedy deficiencies in this area. The disclosure of information outside the advertising arena is examined in Chapter V and, in particular, attention is focused on the mandatory disclosure regime introduced by the Credit Contracts Act 1981 and on packaging and labelling laws. The valiant efforts of organisations such as the Consumers' Institute who disseminate much useful information relating to goods, services and credit, is discussed. In conclusion it is argued that various measures be implemented to improve the quantity and quality of information available in the New Zealand market and to this end it is proposed that a new Consumer Information Act be enacted. It is also submitted that this legislation, and other consumer protection legislation, be administered under the umbrella of a Consumer Affairs Department...|$|E

40|$|In an {{exploration}} of intellectual property and fashion, {{this article examines the}} question of the intermediary liability of online auction-houses for counterfeiting. In the United States, the illustrious jewellery store, Tiffany & Co, brought a legal action against eBay Inc, alleging direct trademark infringement, contributory trademark infringement, false <b>advertising,</b> <b>unfair</b> competition and trademark dilution. The luxury store depicted the online auction-house as a pirate bazaar, a flea-market and a haven for counterfeiting. During epic litigation, eBay Inc successfully defended itself against these allegations in a United States District Court and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Tiffany & Co made a desperate, unsuccessful effort to appeal the matter to the Supreme Court of the United States. The matter featured a number of interventions from amicus curiae — Tiffany was supported by Coty, the Fashion Designer's Guild, and the International Anticounterfeiting Coalition, while eBay was defended by publicly-spirited civil society groups such as Electronic Frontier Foundation, Public Citizen, and Public Knowledge as well as Yahoo!, Google Inc, Amazon. com, and associations representing telecommunications carriers and internet service providers. The litigation in the United States can be counterpointed with the fusillade of legal action against eBay in the European Union. In contrast to Tiffany & Co, Louis Vuitton triumphed over eBay in the French courts — claiming its victory as vindication of the need to protect the commercial interests and cultural heritage of France. However, eBay has fared somewhat better in a dispute with L’Oréal in Great Britain and the European Court of Justice. It is argued that, in a time of flux and uncertainty, Australia should follow the position of the United States courts in Tiffany & Co v eBay Inc.
