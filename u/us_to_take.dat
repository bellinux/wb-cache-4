5|$|In early 1944 the Currans {{were part}} of a group of British {{scientists}} invited to go to the <b>US</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> part in the Manhattan Project – the Allied project to develop an atomic bomb. They joined the British Mission at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory in California, headed by Mark Oliphant, a distinguished Australian scientist that Joan knew from the Cavendish Laboratory. Oliphant also acted as de facto deputy to Ernest Lawrence, the director of the Radiation Laboratory. The mission of the laboratory was to develop the electromagnetic isotope separation process to create enriched uranium for use in atomic bombs.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century {{following}} the Louisiana Purchase, Texas, particularly southeastern Texas, {{had become an}} increasing point of contention between Spain and the United States. Various failed attempts, such as the Long Expedition, were made by groups from the <b>U.S.</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> control of parts of Texas, resulting in some temporary settlements near the bay including Perry's Point near modern Anahuac. Texas State Historical Association. Spanish authorities began efforts to colonize Texas to help protect its claim to the territory. Hoping to spur settlement, the Spanish government granted land to pioneers from the United States, including Moses Austin.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} the winter {{came at a time}} of heavy {{government}} spending with 15per cent of the GDP being spent on the armed forces and large expenditure on the new National Health Service and post-war reconstruction. This made the currency less stable and, coupled with the emergence of the dollar as the currency of choice for foreign reserves, led the government to slash the Bretton Woods official exchange rate from $4.03 to $2.80. This was a major event in Britain's decline from superpower status. With the country struggling to feed its people at home and those it was responsible for in war-torn Europe, it also caused the <b>US</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a greater interest in Europe and push through the Marshall Plan for assistance to Britain and the continent. In addition, the winter is cited as the reason for the emigration of thousands of British people, particularly to Australia. The winter as a whole was less cold than the winter of 1963 but more snow was recorded.|$|E

25|$|In {{supporting}} an Austrian {{war with}} Serbia, Germany's leaders knew {{the risks of}} a general war. As the historian Fritz Fischer pointed out, this could be proven by Jagow's request to know the full itinerary of Wilhelm's North Sea cruise before the Austrian ultimatum was presented because:"Since we want to localize the conflict between Austria and Serbia, we must not have the world alarmed by His Majesty’s returning prematurely; on the other hand, His Majesty must be within reach, in case unpredictable developments should force <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> important decisions, such as mobilization.

25|$|The Choctaw {{coalesced}} as {{a people}} in the 17th century, and developed three distinct political and geographical divisions: eastern, western and southern. These different groups sometimes created distinct, independent alliances with nearby European powers. These included the French, based on the Gulf Coast and in Louisiana; the English of the Southeast, and the Spanish of Florida and Louisiana during the colonial era. During the American Revolution, most Choctaw supported the Thirteen Colonies' bid for independence from the British Crown. They never went to war against the United States but they were forcibly relocated in 1831-1833, {{as part of the}} Indian Removal, in order for the <b>US</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> over their land for development by European Americans.|$|E

25|$|Looking {{for ways}} around the deadlock, Henry Tizard sent Archibald Vivian Hill to the <b>US</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{a survey of}} US {{technical}} capability {{in order to better}} assess what technologies the US would be willing to exchange. This effort was the start on the path that led to the famous Tizard Mission in late August 1940. Ironically, by the time the Mission was being planned, the Norden had been removed from the list of items to be discussed, and Roosevelt personally noted this was due largely to political reasons. Ultimately, although Tizard was unable to convince the US to release the design, he was able to request information about its external dimensions and details on the mounting system so it could be easily added to British bombers if it were released in the future.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the main}} {{characters}} of McCarthyism was John Peurifoy, who was sent as the ambassador of the United States to Guatemala, as {{this was the first}} country in the American sphere of influence after World War II that included elements openly communists in his government. He came from Greece, where he had already done considerable anticommunist activity, and was installed as ambassador in November 1953, when Carlos Castillo Armas was already organizing his tiny revoucionary army. After a long meeting, Peurifoy made it clear to President Arbenz that the US was worried about the communist elements in his government, and then reported to the Department of State that the Guatemalan leader was not a communist, but that surely a Communist leader would come after him; furthermore, in January 1954 he told Time magazine: American public opinion could force <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> some measures to prevent Guatemala from falling into the orbit of international communism.|$|E
25|$|For many, the {{decision}} whether to keep or change their birth {{name is a}} difficult one. This process is expedited for newly married persons in that their marriage certificate, in combination with identification using their married name, is usually accepted {{as evidence of the}} change, due to the widespread custom, but the process still requires approaching every contact who uses the old name and asking them to use the new. Unless the statutes where the marriage occurred specify that a name change may occur at marriage (in which case the marriage certificate indicates the new name), the courts have officially recognized that such a change {{is a result of the}} common law right of a person (man, woman, and sometimes child) to change their name. However, men encounter more difficulties in changing their last names. There were some early cases which held that under the common law, a woman was required (in the <b>U.S.)</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> her husband's name, but newer cases overturned those. Women do not have to change their names by law.|$|E

25|$|Despite Bryan's {{tremendous}} energy, McKinley and the Republicans {{were too}} strong to defeat. The GOP invested {{ten times as}} much money into the campaign as did Bryan's Democratic Party. While Bryan declared “Imperialism to be the paramount issue,” he had difficulty differentiating his platform {{from that of the}} Republican party. While he argued for the <b>US</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> on the role of a protectorate to the Philippines, the Republicans argued that annexation of the Philippines would eventually lead to independence. With the issue of imperialism being defined in these vaguely similar terms, the Republicans' “full dinner pail” platform of a strong American industrial economy proved to be more important to voters than questions of the morality of annexing the Philippines. Bryan held his base in the South, a one-party Democratic region where virtually only white men voted, since the effective disenfranchisement of most blacks {{at the turn of the}} century, but lost part of the West; McKinley retained the populous Northeast and Midwest and rolled up a comfortable margin of victory. McKinley won the electoral college with a count of 292 votes compared to Bryan's 155. Bryan's hold on his party was weakened, while his erstwhile allies the Populists had virtually disappeared from the arena.|$|E
25|$|With {{the share}} price down to $7, the John A. Hartford Foundation finally came to the {{conclusion}} that it could no longer wait for a turnaround. Erivan Haub, owner of the German Tengelmann Group, expressed interest. Born in 1930, Haub studied retailing in the U.S. after World War II and built his family's grocery business into a 2,000-store chain with annual sales of the equivalent of $2 billion. Although still having a home in Germany, his children were born in the United States. Haub agreed to pay $7.375 per share for 42% of A's stock. Haub also quietly bought other shares until he owned 50.3% in February 1981. Scott did not renew his five-year contract; Haub hired James Wood to become chairman. Wood, an Englishman who was the same age as Haub, previously ran the American Grand Union supermarket chain. Many executives recruited by Scott left A they were replaced by Wood's associates from Grand Union. In Germany, Tengelmann had considerable success with Plus stores; they were smaller units featuring low price private-label products along with a limited assortment of meats and produce. A opened several divisions of Plus stores in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> advantage of A's manufacturing plants and numerous small stores. However, the concept failed to win American customers who were attracted to other chains offering low prices on national brands.|$|E
