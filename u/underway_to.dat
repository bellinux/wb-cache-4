5|$|Efforts are <b>underway</b> <b>to</b> {{develop new}} drugs. Some of these involve {{targeted}} therapies against the cancer cells' molecular mechanisms. Others aim {{to target the}} highly resistant cancer stem cells. Still others aim to affect the non-neoplastic stroma and microenvironment of the tumor, which is known to influence cell proliferation and metastasis. A further approach {{involves the use of}} immunotherapy, such as oncolytic viruses.|$|E

5|$|Outside Taiwan, POJ {{is rarely}} used. For example, in Fujian, Xiamen University uses a romanization known as Bbánlám pìngyīm, based on Pinyin. In other areas where Hokkien is spoken, such as Singapore, the Speak Mandarin Campaign is <b>underway</b> <b>to</b> {{actively}} discourage people from speaking Hokkien or other non-Mandarin varieties {{in favour of}} switching to Mandarin instead.|$|E

5|$|By 1920, {{what would}} become DE 4 existed as a county road. The road from Stanton to Wilmington was paved four years later and the portion west of Stanton was paved by 1936. In 1936, work was <b>underway</b> <b>to</b> improve the road between Stanton and Newport by {{widening}} and resurfacing it, with completion a year later. In 1957, Maryland Avenue between Silview and Boxwood Road was widened to four lanes and the one-way pair along Market Street and Justis Street in Newport was established.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} {{preceding}} {{the siege of}} Venice, {{it was believed that}} the Ottoman Empire had preparations <b>underway</b> <b>to</b> attack Malta. This suspicion became stronger when a well-groomed man, who had approached the Order to serve as engineer and offer his wealth of knowledge about fortifications, disappeared shortly after having surveyed Malta's fortifications. Consequently, the Order began its preparations to counter any possible attack by the Ottoman army.|$|E
5|$|Efforts are <b>underway</b> <b>to</b> {{determine}} how the extra chromosome 21 material causes Down syndrome, as currently this is unknown, and to develop treatments to improve intelligence in those with the syndrome. One hope is to use stem cells. Other methods being studied {{include the use of}} antioxidants, gamma secretase inhibition, adrenergic agonists, and memantine. Research is often carried out on an animal model, the Ts65Dn mouse.|$|E

5|$|Many {{species of}} birds are {{economically}} important as food for human consumption and raw material in manufacturing, with domesticated and undomesticated birds (poultry and game) being important sources of eggs, meat, and feathers. Songbirds, parrots, and other species are popular as pets. Guano (bird excrement) is harvested {{for use as a}} fertiliser. Birds prominently figure throughout human culture. About 120–130 species have become extinct due to human activity since the 17th century, and hundreds more before then. Human activity threatens about 1,200 bird species with extinction, though efforts are <b>underway</b> <b>to</b> protect them. Recreational birdwatching {{is an important part of}} the ecotourism industry.|$|E
5|$|The natural poison fluoroacetate (Compound 1080) is {{commonly}} used in Australia to control introduced pests such as European rabbits, foxes, feral predators, and wild dogs such as dingoes. The poison is extremely toxic to introduced pests, but less so to native animals as it is found naturally in many Australian plants. However, juvenile quolls may be susceptible to the poison. Research is <b>underway</b> <b>to</b> determine {{whether the number of}} quolls protected from predators may be less than those killed by the poison.|$|E
5|$|The {{road through}} the San Luis Rey Valley was planned {{as early as}} 1889, and was {{constructed}} during the early 20th century. It {{was added to the}} state highway system in 1933, while the condition of the highway continued to improve. The San Luis Rey Mission Expressway was eventually constructed during the 1990s and 2000s, and efforts were <b>underway</b> <b>to</b> extend the expressway east to I-15 during the 2010s.|$|E

5|$|There is no unique {{generally}} accepted {{system at the}} higher taxonomic levels and there are frequent name changes at every level, from species upwards. Efforts among researchers are now <b>underway</b> <b>to</b> establish and encourage usage of a unified and more consistent nomenclature. Fungal species can also have multiple scientific names depending on their life cycle and mode (sexual or asexual) of reproduction. Web sites such as Index Fungorum and ITIS list current names of fungal species (with cross-references to older synonyms).|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, several {{projects}} went <b>underway</b> <b>to</b> {{improve the}} city water {{available to the}} tenants of Four Seasons Mall. Nearby Northwood Lake {{was included in the}} projects; as several channels between the lake and the mall had eroded. The channels affected in the projects provided water to nearly 285 acres of land in Plymouth. Several initiatives such as ponding, stream restoration, and flow restriction were considered {{to improve the quality of}} the water. In mid 2015, all of the improvement projects were finalized following two years of channel work.|$|E
5|$|After {{ownership}} of the Meridian Main Street {{was transferred to the}} Alliance for Downtown Meridian in late 2007, the two organizations, along with the Meridian Downtown Association, spearheaded the downtown revitalization effort. The Alliance serves as an umbrella organization, allowing the other two organizations to use the its support staff and housing, and in turn the Alliance serves as a liaison between the organizations. Plans were <b>underway</b> <b>to</b> renovate the Threefoot Building, but newly elected Mayor Cheri Barry killed the plans in early 2010. Today, the Alliance helps to promote further development and restoration downtown; its goal is to assist businesses such as specialty shops, restaurants, and bars because these help downtown become more active during the day and at night. The Meridian Downtown Association is primarily focused on increasing foot traffic downtown by organizing special events, and the Meridian Main Street program supports existing businesses downtown.|$|E
50|$|NCDOT {{approved}} the Eastern Roxboro Bypass, a four-lane highway from US Hwy 501 south intersection of Old Durham Road to NC Hwy. 49 north. This project has yet <b>to</b> get <b>underway</b> due <b>to</b> funding.|$|R

5|$|After some {{discussion}} he was persuaded to disembark {{so that the}} Helmuth could continue operations. Leaving demolition parties aboard the cargo vessels, Ritchie then took the Helmuth further downriver to check for other shipping, but the small ship grounded on a sandbar. Assuming the route was blocked, {{he returned to the}} two cargo ships on one of the expedition's small launches. It was at this stage, whilst conducting a final inspection, that he made the discovery {{of a large number of}} empty ammunition cases and discarded bullets in the holds of the cargo ships. Deducing that the German crew had armed themselves before they left their vessels, he suspected preparations were <b>underway</b> <b>to</b> ambush his force when it attempted to leave the harbour.|$|E
5|$|Even before Carpathia {{arrived in}} New York, efforts were getting <b>underway</b> <b>to</b> {{retrieve}} the dead. Four ships chartered by the White Star Line succeeded in retrieving 328bodies; 119 were buried at sea, while the remaining 209 were brought ashore to the Canadian port of Halifax, Nova Scotia, where 150 {{of them were}} buried. Memorials were raised in various places– New York, Washington, Southampton, Liverpool, Belfast and Lichfield, among others– and ceremonies were held {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic to commemorate the dead and raise funds to aid the survivors. The bodies of most of Titanics victims were never recovered, and the only evidence of their deaths was found 73years later among the debris on the seabed: pairs of shoes lying side by side, where bodies had once lain before eventually decomposing.|$|E
5|$|Following White's retirement, the Oak Room {{continued}} to operate under Reid, albeit {{with a new}} menu where the prices were reduced by between a third to a half. The majority of the staff remained with Reid, with Jeff Galvin installed as the new head chef, until he left to run the restaurant L'Escargot in May 2000. MPW Criterion was wound up on 11 September 2001; by which time planning was already <b>underway</b> <b>to</b> close the Oak Room, which took place on 15 February 2002. By this time, there were 15 other kitchen staff, and a further 15 front of house staff. There was some added difficulty for calculating the redundancy packages for the staff since {{none of them had}} written contracts, and were only calculated from the period when the restaurant was owned by the MPW Criterion company; this reduced Reid's total service from nine years to four.|$|E
