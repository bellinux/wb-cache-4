5|$|Little {{is known}} about Shvarn and his rule, but historians believe he was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> control of all Lithuania, and ruled only over its {{southern}} portions. He died in 1269 or 1271 in Galicia.|$|E
5|$|The same year, Philip invaded Pergamon; {{although}} <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the easily defended city, in {{part due}} to precautions taken by Attalus to provide for additional fortifications, he demolished the surrounding temples and altars.|$|E
5|$|Furious {{that his}} army had been <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Moscow, Hitler {{dismissed}} his commander-in-chief, Walther von Brauchitsch, on 19 December 1941, and took personal {{charge of the}} Wehrmacht, effectively taking control of all military decisions. Additionally, Hitler surrounded himself with staff officers {{with little or no}} recent combat experience.|$|E

50|$|When the Kosovo War ended, on 12 June 1999, the {{majority}} of Serbs who were living in Kosovo at that time, were forced to flee, {{and those who were}} <b>unable</b> <b>to,</b> <b>took</b> refuge and hid themselves in the Prizren Seminary, where they were fed and protected by the UN peacekeeping Kosovo Force, until a place for them to settle was found. Serbs hiding in the Seminary were sent for Serbia in August 1999. After the refugee Albanians returned to Prizren, they burned and damaged Serbian buildings, including the Seminary.|$|R
50|$|Danny pitches {{the idea}} of a sailing trip to their group of friends. This plan refers back to their {{childhood}} fantasies of being adventurers and pirates. However, Danny's friends have obligations and claim they are <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> just <b>take</b> off.|$|R
5|$|Smallpeice and Slattery were {{praised by}} Guthrie in 1964, when the airline {{reported}} a {{profit for the}} 1963–1964 financial year, commenting that he was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> credit for the performance and this his predecessors were {{largely responsible for the}} improved financial performance of the airline.|$|E
5|$|A dry track during Q2 {{saw the two}} Mercedes drivers fastest, Rosberg four-tenths of {{a second}} faster than Hamilton. Fernando Alonso failed {{to make it into}} Q3, the seventh time that season. He had missed the last part of {{qualifying}} seven times over the entire course of his Ferrari stint in the five previous seasons. Daniel Ricciardo was eliminated in 14th place, meaning that he - like Button - was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the full extent of his ten-place grid penalty.|$|E
5|$|Davidson had an {{interrupted}} lead-in to the Tests. He injured himself while batting in {{his sixth}} match, against the MCC, and was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> any further {{part in the}} match. He was out of action for two weeks but recovered {{in time for the}} First Test at Trent Bridge. He had scored 46 runs at 11.50 and took 13 wickets at 20.92during his preparation.|$|E
50|$|In 1216, a {{group of}} rebel barons invited the future Louis VIII of France <b>to</b> come and <b>take</b> the English crown. He had some success {{breaching}} the walls, but was <b>unable</b> ultimately <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the castle (see The First Barons' War).|$|R

5|$|For {{people who}} are unwilling or <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{medication}} regularly, long-acting depot preparations of antipsychotics {{may be used to}} achieve control. They reduce the risk of relapse to a greater degree than oral medications. When used in combination with psychosocial interventions, they may improve long-term adherence to treatment. The American Psychiatric Association suggests considering stopping antipsychotics in some people if there are no symptoms for more than a year.|$|E
5|$|Governor Moore {{received}} formal {{notification concerning}} the hostilities, and he organized and led a force against Spanish Florida. 500 English colonial soldiers and militia, along with 300 Indians, captured and burned {{the town of}} St. Augustine in the 1702 Siege of St. Augustine. The English were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the main fortress and withdrew when a Spanish fleet arrived from Havana. In 1706, Carolina successfully repulsed an attack on Charles Town by a combined Spanish and French amphibious force sent from Havana.|$|E
5|$|He {{took part}} in {{qualification}} for the 2002 World Cup, scoring twice in a 6–0 win against Bulgaria. After finishing second in their qualifying group, the Czech Republic played a two-legged playoff against Belgium. Rosický was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> part in the first game, a 1–0 loss, due to suspension; in the second match, {{he played in the}} 1–0 loss as Belgium qualified for the 2002 World Cup at the Czechs' expense.|$|E

5|$|The NPL did {{not have}} the {{expertise}} to build a machine like ACE, so they contacted Tommy Flowers at the General Post Office's (GPO) Dollis Hill Research Laboratory. Flowers, the designer of Colossus, the world's first programmable electronic computer, was committed elsewhere and was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> part in the project, although his team did build some mercury delay lines for ACE. The Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) was also approached for assistance, as was Maurice Wilkes at the University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|The Tobruk {{garrison}} received {{supplies from}} the Royal Navy and Rommel was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the port. This failure was significant; his front line positions at Sollum {{were at the}} end of an extended supply chain that stretched back to Tripoli and was threatened by the Tobruk garrison. The substantial commitment required to invest Tobruk prevented him from building up his forces at Sollum, making further advances into Egypt impractical. By maintaining possession of Tobruk, the Allies had regained the initiative.|$|E
5|$|With James Wilder {{leaving the}} game after {{aggravating}} his rib injury, the Buccaneers were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> advantage of Green Bay Packers quarterback Randy Wright's three interceptions. Wright completed 18 of 29 passes for 238 yards, with a career-best three first-half touchdowns. The win {{was only the}} Packers' second of the season. The loss left the Buccaneers' defense in last place in the league, despite their having spent four of their first five draft picks on defensive players.|$|E
50|$|The {{election}} also {{witnessed the}} election of Britain's first Jewish MP; the Liberal Lionel de Rothschild in the City of London. Members being sworn in were however required to swear the Christian Oath of Allegiance, meaning Rothschild was <b>unable</b> actually <b>to</b> <b>take</b> his seat until {{the passage of the}} Jews Relief Act in 1858.|$|R
60|$|Stephen nodded; {{looking to}} Rachael for an explanation, {{which she was}} quite <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> give him; <b>took</b> the candle, went downstairs, {{and in a few}} moments returned, {{lighting}} Louisa into the room. She was followed by the whelp.|$|R
50|$|On May 4, 1961, Hank Thomas {{joined the}} first Freedom Rider group. Originally, {{he was not}} going to participate, but his roommate, who was {{supposed}} to join the event, got sick and was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> attend. Thomas <b>took</b> his place.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} {{children}} were killed, injured or orphaned by the violence. Organisations such as Citizens' Initiative reported that the violence resulted in the disturbance of children's studies {{and that there was}} a lack of counselling. Students at Gujarat University were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> examinations, which were cancelled due to the chances of disruption. While other schools in the state had to postpone or cancel exams, it was reported that some schools held examinations under police protection. It was also reported that many students were forced to leave their studies due to lack of funds or to earn a livelihood because they had lost income-earning members of their families.|$|E
5|$|Academic {{journals}} and conferences, however, {{have continued to}} comment on the theme of race within the game. In 2011, Andre Brock from Games and Culture said that the game drew from well-established racial and gender stereotypes, saying that the African people were only ever depicted as savage, even before transitioning into zombies. Writing for the Digital Games Research Association in 2011, Geyser and Tshabalala noted that racial stereotyping had never been in intention of Capcom, though compared their depiction of Africa to that of the 1899 novel Heart of Darkness. Post-colonial Africa, they opined, was portrayed as being <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> care of itself, and at the mercy of Western influences.|$|E
5|$|Between 1145 and 1146 Stephen {{made another}} attempt to seize Wallingford, but was again <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the castle despite {{building}} a powerful counter-castle to the east, opposite Wallingford at Crowmarsh Gifford, and building castles to the west at Brightwell, South Moreton and Cholsey. He returned with larger forces in 1152, reestablishing the counter-castle at Crowmarsh Gifford and building another one overlooking Wallingford bridge, and settled his forces down to starve the castle out. Brien, supported by Miles' son, Roger of Hereford, who had also become trapped in the castle, attempted {{to break through the}} blockade, but without success.|$|E

President Olexander Turchynov said on 30 April: [...] "I {{would like}} to say frankly that at the moment the {{security}} structures are <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> swiftly <b>take</b> the situation in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions back under control", and that security forces [...] "tasked with the protection of citizens" [...] were [...] "helpless". On 7 April an [...] "anti-terrorist" [...] operation against militants was started in Luhansk and Donetsk self-proclaimed republics.|$|R
50|$|With his stated {{intent to}} capture the {{strategic}} city of Acapulco de Juárez, Morelos {{decided that it was}} vital <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the high ground at the Cerro del Veladero as this mountain surrounded the entire port city. Morelos sent 700 men, under the command of Captain Rafael Valdovinos, <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the mountain. Valdovinos was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> initially <b>take</b> the mountain and was dislodged by royalist forces, losing his position on the mountain. Whilst these actions were taking place, the Guerrero brothers, Bravo and Vicente, arrived at the battle and bolstered the rebel forces with their own soldiers.|$|R
50|$|His health {{deteriorated}} {{after his}} time {{serving in the}} Crimean War at which point he became addicted to both opium and chloroform. Destitute and <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> work, he <b>took</b> lodgings with a Mr Walter Rochfort a pharmacist, at 1 Kensington Park Gardens in Notting Hill, London.|$|R
5|$|Debate exists {{over the}} {{significance}} and {{outcome of the}} battle. The German forces destroyed many Soviet tanks and temporarily degraded the striking power of the 5th Guards Tank Army, but they were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Prokhorovka or break through into open ground before developments elsewhere forced the termination of Operation Citadel. For the Soviet side, the massive armoured attack of 12 July failed to destroy the II SS-Panzer Corps, but succeeded in exhausting the Germans and eventually contributed to checking their advance. Thus, neither the 5th Guards Tank Army nor the II SS-Panzer Corps accomplished their objectives for 12 July.|$|E
5|$|Funds were {{provided}} {{for the purchase of}} a 6-inch (150mm) refracting telescope from T. Cooke & Sons. The dome was originally designed to mount a small transit, and the lengthy telescope, over 2 metres long, had a limited field of view though the dome's opening. A large stone pillar was constructed inside the tower, raising the telescope to bring it closer to the dome and improve its field of view. Unfortunately, the new telescope was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> part in the transit measurements due to bad weather, and missed the 1895 Transit of Mercury for the same reason.|$|E

Her father found himself <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> care of all of his children and various friends and relations then offered to take them in.|$|E
5|$|Palmer {{begins by}} {{defending}} {{the claim that}} animals have moral standing, and then surveys three key approaches to animal ethics; utilitarian approaches, animal rights approaches, and capabilities approaches. All are lacking, she argues, as they are fundamentally capacity-oriented, and thus <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> properly <b>take</b> account of human relationships to animals. However, her approach leans more strongly towards a Regan-inspired rights view. She next identifies different kinds of relations humans may have with animals: affective, contractual and, most significantly, causal.|$|R
50|$|The Kansas City Wizards {{put an end}} {{to their}} two-game losing streak, and Houston Dynamo got another point, as the two teams battled to a 1 - 1 draw in a game marred by yellow cards and missed {{opportunities}} at Robertson Stadium. Dynamo picked up a point on FC Dallas, who fell to D.C. United, but for the second consecutive game, they were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> fully <b>take</b> advantage in extending their lead in the Western Conference.|$|R
