50|$|Torilis is a genus {{of plants}} which are known {{generally}} as the <b>hedge</b> <b>parsleys.</b> They are native to Eurasia and North Africa {{but have been}} introduced to other continents. T. arvensis is quite widespread in North America but is facing population decline in the UK.|$|R
50|$|The {{monotypic}} genus Yabea {{contains the}} single species Yabea microcarpa, {{which is known}} by the common names California <b>hedge</b> <b>parsley</b> and false carrot. It is similar in appearance to other species of wild carrot and relatives. It is native to western North America, including the western United States, British Columbia and Baja California. It grows in many types of habitat.|$|R
40|$|A new canopy {{training}} system (“bent canopy”) {{is widely used}} in greenhouse rose production. The bent canopy consists of a <b>upright</b> <b>hedge</b> and a mat of bent shoots between the hedges. The idea of this heterogeneous canopy is to utilize radiation that falls into the aisle space. A radiative transfer model was developed for a bent canopy. Diffuse and direct light distribution and absorption were simulated by calculating the path length of attenuated light through the canopy. Assimilation rates of sunlit and shaded leaf area were then calculated in relation to position within the canopy and time of day. Numerical integration of the sunlit and shaded assimilation rates over the respective leaf area index (LAI), leaf age, and over the day yielded diurnal course of canopy photosynthesis. The geometry of the canopy was described by hedge height and width, depth and width of the bent canopy, row direction, leaf angle, and leaf area density (LAD). The simulation indicated that bent canopy system is less sensitive to row direction than the conventional hedgerow canopy and that the desired LAD of the bent portion {{was related to the}} LAD of the <b>upright</b> <b>hedges...</b>|$|R
50|$|The 'Old Wood' {{containing}} the ice {{house has a}} good plant diversity {{due to the fact}} that it is long established and relatively undisturbed, unlike the park's plantations which are of a comparatively recent origin. Chapelholms wood shows a similar high biodiversity. Plants such as dog's mercury, tussock grass, bluebells and honeysuckle are indicators of old deciduous woodlands. Snowdrops are a highlight of spring in the park. A few specimen trees from the estate days survive, especially sycamores (Acer pseudoplatanus) or plane trees as they are traditionally known in Scotland. The park is one of the relatively few sites in Scotland where the <b>upright</b> <b>hedge</b> bedstraw (Galium album) grows.|$|R
50|$|Torilis arvensis is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the parsley family known by the common names spreading hedgeparsley, tall sock-destroyer and common <b>hedge</b> <b>parsley.</b> It is native to parts of Europe and it is known elsewhere, such as North America, as an introduced species and a common weed. It grows in many types of habitat, especially disturbed areas. It is an annual herb producing a slender, branching, rough-haired stem up to a meter in maximum height. The alternately arranged leaves are each divided into several pairs of lance-shaped leaflets up to 6 centimeters long each. The leaflet is divided or deeply cut into segments or teeth. The inflorescence is a wide open compound umbel of flower clusters on long, slender rays. Each flower has five petals which are unequal in size and are white with a pinkish or reddish tinge. Each greenish or pinkish fruit is 3 to 5 millimeters long and is coated in straight or curving prickles.|$|R
50|$|Torilis japonica, the erect hedgeparsley, {{upright hedge-parsley}} or Japanese <b>hedge</b> <b>parsley,</b> is a plant {{species in the}} genus Torilis. Japanese Hedgeparsley is {{considered}} both an annual and biennial plant in the carrot family depending on the biogeographical location. This means Japanese Hedgeparsley can complete its life cycle in either one or two growing seasons depending on habitat. Japanese Hedgeparsley is typically found in areas with disturbed soils, pastures, margins, open woodland, near waste sites, or right-of-way habitats. It can withstand a variety of habitats, thriving in partial and full shaded areas, but also withstanding habitats with full sunlight penetration. It is considered an aggressive invasive species in North America; invading {{a wide range of}} habitats due to its environmental tolerance and tendency to outcompete native vegetation. This species is considered a threat in several areas that causes problems relating to overall environmental health and stability. Aside from its environmental implications, T. japonica has potential to fight several cancers through a terpene it produces called Torilin, extracted from its fruits.|$|R
50|$|Alternaria Leaf Blight is a foliar {{disease of}} carrots {{caused by the}} fungus Alternaria dauci. Alternaria dauci is {{included}} in the porri species group of Alternaria, which is classified for having large conidium and a long, slender filiform beak. Because many of the members of this group have similar morphology, Alternaria dauci has also been classified as formae specialis of carrots, or A. porri f. sp. dauci. It has been well established that the host range of this disease is on cultivated and wild carrot, but it has also been claimed that Alternaria dauci has the ability to infect wild parsnip, celery, and parsley. A study in 2011 by Boedo et al. evaluated the host range of Alternaria dauci in a controlled environment and concluded that several non-carrot species could constitute alternate hosts, such as Ridolfia segetum (corn parsley) and Caucalis tenet (<b>hedge</b> <b>parsley).</b> Despite their findings, reports of A. dauci colonization on non-carrot hosts continues to be debated because the use of Koch's Postulates on recovered isolates of A. dauci is challenging and is rarely reported; in addition, few reports are often made of such infections in field settings.|$|R
