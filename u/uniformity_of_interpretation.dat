50|$|The {{need for}} this kind of court in Europe became {{apparent}} with the Ancien Régime's difficulties in maintaining both <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation</b> and supremacy of the central laws against local privileges and rights. This kind of court first appeared during the French Revolution. The original French courts were initially much more like a legislative body than a judicial one. During his conquests, Napoleon greatly influenced Italian legal theory, and the Court of Cassation was formed using many imported French ideas.|$|E

Nineteen such units are recognised, as follows: Tenuicostatum Chronozone, Paltum Subchronozone (paltum), Clevelandicum Subchronozone (crosbeyi, clevelandicum), Tenuicostatum Subchronozone (tenuicostatum), Semicelatum Subchronozone (semicelatum, antiquum), Serpentinum Chronozone, Exaratum Subchronozone (elegantulum, exaratum, elegans), Falciferum Subchronozone (pseudoserpentinum, falciferum), Bifrons Chronozone, Commune Subchronozone (ovatum, commune, athleticum), Fibulatum Subchronozone (turriculum, braunianus, vortex), Crassum Subchronozone (crassum-bifrons, crassum-semipolitum). The presence of shared taxa permits detailed correlations to be established with submediterranean zonal schemes in more southerly areas of Europe and an equilibration of zonal boundaries across the region is therefore proposed, providing a <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation</b> for the European Lower Toarcian. </p...|$|E

40|$|The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, {{like many}} {{multilateral}} conventions, has no supra-national institution to resolve controversies that arise {{with respect to}} interpretation of the Convention. As a result, interpretation of the treaty [...] an aspect of International law [...] is left to national judges in the national courts. In {{the context of the}} Abduction Convention, which establishes a mechanism for cooperation among countries to deter and remedy parental abduction internationally, Professor Silberman argues that the need for <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation</b> is critical and she proposes a variety of tools for achieving such uniformity. She stresses the need for the acceptance of 2 ̆ 2 autonomous concepts 2 ̆ 2 divorced from national law as an approach to interpretation, the desirability of looking to foreign precedents in attempting to develop a global jurisprudence, and an increased and more robust role for the Hague Conference itself with respect to these issues of interpretation...|$|E
40|$|Respondents to computer-administered surveys don't always {{interpret}} ordinary {{words and}} phrases uniformly; clarification dialog can help improve <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation,</b> and thus survey data quality. Here we explore two approaches to the interfaces for web-based questionnaires that could {{increase the number of}} occasions when helpful clarification is provided. One approach is to increase respondents ’ sensitivity to the possibility of conceptual misalignment by rewording questions so that they include part of the definition of the key concept(s). We found that under some circumstances this led to increased requests for the full definition, suggesting that respondents recognize the potential for conceptual misalignment. Another approach is to build respondent models so that a mixed-initiative survey system can determine when respondents are confused and volunteer clarification. Such models can vary in their specificity from generic respondents to groups of respondents (stereotypic models) to models of individual respondents. Our data show both potential benefits and pitfalls to this approach, and they begin to map out the territory for dialog in systems that collect data from users, as opposed to systems that provide data to users. Our data also begin to help determine the circumstances under which more sophisticated survey dialog systems with Natural Language generation and comprehension abilities are needed...|$|E

40|$|Hidden {{underneath}} the racy death penalty issues in Kansas v. Marsh lurks a seemingly dull procedural issue addressed only in separate opinions by Justices Stevens and Scalia: whether the Court should {{have heard the}} case in the first place. As he did in three cases from the Court’s 2005 term, Justice Stevens argued in Marsh that the Court has no legitimate interest in reviewing state court decisions that overprotect federal constitutional rights. Instead, the Supreme Court should exercise its certiorari power to tip the scales against states and in favor of individuals. Granting certiorari in Marsh, Stevens argued, was not motivated by a desire to create <b>uniformity</b> in <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> federal law, but was motivated by “[n]othing more than an interest in facilitating the imposition of the death penalty. ” Justice Scalia vehemently disagreed, writing that Stevens’s argument rested on a “misguided view of federalism” and ignored the need for integ-rity and <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> federal law. He believes that would create a “crazy quilt,” in which each state could interpret the federal Constitution as it saw fit so long each such interpretation gave individuals more protection than necessary...|$|R

40|$|The second {{language}} acquisition (SLA) literatureover the past 30 yearshas seen miscellaneous <b>interpretations</b> and applications <b>of</b> the term ‘fossilisation’. This, {{on the one}} hand, {{is a sign of}} improvement in the general understanding of the theoretical construct. On the other hand, however, the lack <b>of</b> <b>uniformity</b> in <b>interpretation</b> and application creates confusion, which can be counterproductive to {{second language}} theory and practice. In this article,I will unveil and discuss some major conceptual and methodological issues surrounding fossilisation. I will show that fossilisation is no longer a monolithic concept as it was three decades ago but rather one tied up with various manifestations of failure in L 2 learning, and thus that any attempt to explain fossilisation by way of a singular explanation will prove to be inadequate. I also argue that in constructing theories of SLA, fossilisation remains a central issue to be confronted and explained, hence the need to develop principled approaches to investigating it...|$|R

40|$|The <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> wheat seed {{emergence}} is {{an important}} characteristic used to evaluate cultivars, cultivation mode and field management. Currently, researchers typically investigated the <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> seed emergence by manual measurement, a time-consuming and laborious process. This study employed field RGB images from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to obtain information related to the <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> wheat seed emergence and missing seedlings. The calculation {{of the length of}} areas with missing seedlings in both drill and broadcast sowing can be achieved by using an area localization algorithm, which facilitated the comprehensive evaluation <b>of</b> <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> seed emergence. Through a comparison between UAV images and the results of manual surveys used to gather data on the <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> seed emergence, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) was 0. 44 for broadcast sowing and 0. 64 for drill sowing. The RMSEs of the numbers of missing seedling regions for broadcast and drill sowing were 1. 39 and 3. 99, respectively. The RMSEs of the lengths of the missing seedling regions were 12. 39 cm for drill sowing and 0. 20 cm 2 for broadcast sowing. The UAV image-based method provided a new and greatly improved method for efficiently measuring the <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> wheat seed emergence. The proposed method could provide a guideline for the intelligent evaluation <b>of</b> the <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> wheat seed emergence...|$|R
5000|$|With the {{unlikely}} {{prospects for a}} national court of tax appeals, a number of commentators have argued for going back to a ‘’Dobson’’ era approach with great deference given by the circuit courts, {{as well as other}} courts of original jurisdiction to Tax Court decisions to the extent the decisions address the law rather than factual issues. Professor Shores, for instance, argues that, short of a national court of tax appeals that would provide consistent decisions about what the tax law means, substantial improvement in the level of consistency would be provided by the appellate courts adopting the ‘’Dobson’’ approach of great deference to Tax Court decisions. [...] While Shores takes the view that the Tax Court is more likely to correctly interpret federal tax laws than generalist courts, he appears to prize <b>uniformity</b> in <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> the tax code as the primary virtue to be sought, quoting with favor a view that “it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than it be settled right.” ...|$|R
