Four studies were conducted to examine the extent o which forgiving could be predicted with relationship-level ariables <b>uch</b> <b>as</b> satisfaction, commitment, and closeness; offense-level variables <b>uch</b> <b>as</b> apology and impact of the offense; and social-cognitive ariables <b>uch</b> <b>as</b> offunder-focused empathy and rumination about he offense.

The measure demonstrated a variety of desirable psychometric properties, commending its use for future research. As predicted, empathy, apology, rumination, and several indexes of relationship closeness were associated with self-reported forgiving. The concept of forgiving, although not a traditional focus of personality and social psychology, has been of passing theoreti-cal and empirical interest o the discipline for 40 years.
