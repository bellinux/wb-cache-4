5000|$|Current {{situation}} {{that have led}} to this sudden moves is reported to be by influence of film studios in India and courts who have regularly issued orders in the favor for them. Often these are done with the contracted lawyers of film studios approach courts in regular intervals ahead and after a movie's release seeking preventive blocks on the URLs they compile and list. This lists in reality are unprofessionally and [...] "poorly compiled and often block is sought on full websites just on the basis of whims and fancies". [...] "Once this order are issued, the copies of the order along with the list of URLs to be blocked go to DoT, which then they pass an order to internet service providers to block these sites". The interesting part here is that once a URL is blocked it remains blocked, even years after the release of the film without an expiry.

5000|$|<b>Under</b> <b>copyright</b> <b>laws</b> of many countries, {{anyone with}} the intent to remix an {{existing}} work is liable for lawsuit because the laws protect the intellectual property of the work. However, current copyright laws are proving to be ineffective at preventing sampling of content. On the other hand, fair-use does not address a wide enough range of use-cases and its borders are not well established and defined, making usage under [...] "fair use" [...] legally risky. Lessig argues {{that there needs to be}} a change in the current state of copyright laws to legalize remix culture, especially for fair-use cases. He states that [...] "outdated copyright laws have turned our children into criminals." [...] One proposition is to adopt the system of citation used with book references. The artist would cite the intellectual property she sampled which would give the original creator the credit, as is common with literature references. As tools for doing so Lawrence Lessig proposed the Creative Commons licenses which demand for instance Attribution without restricting the general use of a creative work. One step further is the Free content movement, which proposes that creative content should be released under free licenses. The Copyright reform movement tries to tackle the problem by cutting for instance the excessive long copyright terms, as it was debated by scholar Rufus Pollock.|$|E
