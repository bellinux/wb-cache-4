5|$|Detective J.D. LaRue (Kiel Martin) {{attempts}} to woo Davenport using {{less and less}} ethical means, eventually calling {{her back to the}} precinct to pick up her lost client even though he was never found. When she realizes his ruse, she pours a cup of hot coffee in his lap. <b>Undercover</b> <b>officer</b> Belker (Bruce Weitz) arrests a bald-headed pickpocket at the hostage situation and processes him at the precinct. Belker's proclivity for biting the ankles of perpetrators redeems itself in this episode. Desk Sergeant Phil Esterhaus (Michael Conrad) confides in Fay about his teen-age sweetheart, Cindy. When officers Hill (Michael Warren) and Renko (Charles Haid) respond to a domestic situation, their police car is stolen, and they are shot after walking into a rundown building while trying to find a phone to call in the theft.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, a {{campaign}} to rid New York City of gay bars was in full effect by order of Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr., who {{was concerned about the}} image of the city in preparation for the 1964 World's Fair. The city revoked the liquor licenses of the bars, and undercover police officers worked to entrap as many homosexual men as possible. Entrapment usually consisted of an <b>undercover</b> <b>officer</b> who found a man in a bar or public park, engaged him in conversation; if the conversation headed toward the possibility that they might leave together—or the officer bought the man a drink—he was arrested for solicitation. One story in the New York Post described an arrest in a gym locker room, where the officer grabbed his crotch, moaning, and a man who asked him if he was all right was arrested. Few lawyers would defend cases as undesirable as these, and some of those lawyers kicked back their fees to the arresting officer.|$|E

25|$|On 6 November 1990, Chikatilo {{killed and}} {{mutilated}} a 22-year-old woman, named Svetlana Korostik, in woodland near Donleskhoz station. While leaving the crime scene, he was observed by an <b>undercover</b> <b>officer.</b> The policeman observed Chikatilo approach a well and wash {{his hands and}} face. When he approached the station, the <b>undercover</b> <b>officer</b> noted that Chikatilo's coat had grass and soil stains on the elbows. Chikatilo also had a small red smear on his cheek. To the officer, he looked suspicious. The only reason people entered woodland near the station {{at that time of}} year was to gather wild mushrooms (a popular pastime in Russia), but Chikatilo was not dressed like a typical forest scavenger; he was wearing more formal attire. Moreover, he had a nylon sports bag, which was unsuitable for carrying mushrooms. The policeman stopped Chikatilo and checked his papers, but had no formal reason to arrest him. When the policeman returned to his office, he filed a routine report, containing the name of the person he had stopped at the station.|$|E
5000|$|He {{was accused}} of {{misleading}} MP's in a Select Committee report on the G20. He incorrectly informed them that no <b>undercover</b> police <b>officers</b> were operating after an MP raised concerns {{about the use of}} agent provocatuers. Later it was revealed that 25 <b>undercover</b> <b>officers</b> were deployed and were mixing with demonstrators. Once this was revealed, Broadhurst claimed that the deployment of <b>undercover</b> <b>officers</b> was unknown to him, and that the plainclothes officers (some of whom were filmed with extended batons) were [...] "evidence gatherers".|$|R
50|$|One {{member of}} the Iron Horsemen was shot in a gunfight with Cincinnati Police on September 18, 2010.

25|$|Both Lester and Foster {{were arrested}} at the {{residence}} and {{were charged with}} aggravated robbery and aggravated kidnapping. Upon search of the residence the officers found a few legally owned handguns and small amounts of marijuana. They alleged they had evidence of other illegal activities. Both men were jailed and held in lieu of 3 million dollar bonds. Other than the charges stemming from the club's unmasking of the <b>undercover</b> <b>officer,</b> however, no other charges have been filed.|$|E
25|$|On August 6, 2010, various {{media outlets}} {{released}} {{a transcript of}} conversations between an RCMP undercover operator and Pickton in his holding cell. While the RCMP censored the undercover officer's name {{throughout most of the}} document, his name was left uncensored in several portions of the document that the RCMP released to the public. This uncensored version was available to the public, through Global News, CTV News, and the Vancouver Sun, for about an hour before being pulled and re-edited. It is not known the extent of the damage this mistake caused the <b>undercover</b> <b>officer.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Olson {{was accused}} of {{stalling}} federal U.S. Department of Justice mediation between the MPD and hometown civil rights groups focused around North Minneapolis. Unpopular with Mayor R. T. Rybak, Olson was ousted in 2003 and William McManus was appointed, former chief of Dayton, Ohio, and former assistant chief in Washington, D.C. His tenure was intended to reverse Olson's past actions. McManus worked on improving internal promotions and politics within the department to achieve racial equality in officer ranks. The attempted overhaul of Internal Affairs and greater attention over policing did generate larger respect for the department from communities of color and even gang members. However, his support was split in the Council, and though personally endorsed, he conflicted with Mayor Rybak over promotions and {{the handling of the}} 2003 Duy Ngo incident, in which Ngo, an <b>undercover</b> <b>officer,</b> was shot by another officer. In early 2006, facing an uncertain reconfirmation for a second three-year term, McManus sought and accepted the police chief position in San Antonio, Texas.|$|E

50|$|The Independent on Sunday {{reported}} in 2014 that the police's Professional Standards Directorate was examining potential criminal offences by <b>undercover</b> <b>officers</b> {{at the time}} of a police raid on Elm Guest House in June 1982. The raid took place while two officers were at the premises posing as guests. A former masseur, Lee Towsey, then aged 16 (that is, under the homosexual age of consent at the time), alleged he had sex with two <b>undercover</b> <b>officers</b> at the guest house.|$|R
50|$|During October 2011 activists {{from the}} group exposed Robert Lambert, whom they had known as Bob Robinson, as being a former <b>undercover</b> police <b>officer</b> who had {{infiltrated}} the group. Following a number of court cases that centred on Lambert and other <b>undercover</b> police <b>officers,</b> in 2014 and 2015 the Metropolitan Police apologised and paid substantial compensation to eight women who had discovered they had had intimate relationships with <b>undercover</b> <b>officers,</b> including Lambert. The police admitted that the relationships had been “abusive, deceitful, manipulative and wrong”.|$|R
500|$|... "Exit Through the Kwik-E-Mart" [...] is {{the fifteenth}} {{episode of the}} twenty-third season of the American {{animated}} television sitcom The Simpsons. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 4, 2012. In the episode, Bart is punished by Homer after letting a rabbit loose in the house. He gets revenge on his father by spray-painting images of him with the word [...] "dope" [...] all over Springfield. Street artist Shepard Fairey encounters Bart one night and offers him a gallery show of Bart's artworks. However, Chief Wiggum suddenly appears during the show and arrests Bart for covering the town in graffiti. It turns out that Fairey is an <b>undercover</b> <b>officer</b> working for Wiggum.|$|E
500|$|Homer {{initially}} {{refuses to}} attend Bart's show because he discovers the artwork {{is an insult}} to him, but changes his mind after Bart apologizes and writes [...] "I'm sorry" [...] on the hood of Homer's car. At the show, Chief Wiggum and the Springfield Police Department suddenly appear to arrest Bart for making graffiti throughout the town. It is revealed that the gallery show is a sham and that Fairey is an <b>undercover</b> <b>officer</b> who helped the police identify Bart as the graffiti artist that had been spray-painting Springfield. Since Bart is just a boy, he is not sent to jail. Instead, he is punished by once again being locked up in the rabbit cage. When Bart tells Wiggum that he has to go to the bathroom, Wiggum covers the cage with the blanket and finds Bart gone when he removes the blanket from the cage.|$|E
500|$|In {{the final}} {{black-and-white}} sequence, {{prompted by the}} caller, Leonard meets with Teddy, an <b>undercover</b> <b>officer,</b> who has found Leonard's [...] "John G," [...] Jimmy, and directs Leonard to the abandoned building. When Jimmy arrives, Leonard strangles him and takes {{a photo of the}} body. As it develops, the black-and-white transitions to the final color sequence. Leonard swaps clothes with Jimmy, hearing him whisper [...] "Sammy." [...] As Leonard has only told Sammy's story to those he has met, he suddenly doubts Jimmy's role. Teddy arrives and asserts that Jimmy was John G, but when Leonard is undeterred, Teddy reveals that he helped him kill the real attacker a year ago, and he has been using Leonard ever since. Teddy points out that since [...] "John G" [...] is common, he will cyclically forget and begin again and that even Teddy himself has a [...] "John G" [...] name. Further, Teddy claims that Sammy's story is Leonard's himself, repressing the memory to escape guilt.|$|E

500|$|An {{article in}} the local press {{describing}} Zappa as [...] "the Movie King of Cucamonga" [...] prompted the local police to suspect that he was making pornographic films. In March 1965, Zappa was approached by a vice squad <b>undercover</b> <b>officer,</b> and accepted an offer of $100 to produce a suggestive audio tape for an alleged stag party. Zappa and a female friend recorded a faked erotic episode. When Zappa was about {{to hand over the}} tape, he was arrested, and the police stripped the studio of all recorded material. The press was tipped off beforehand, and next day's The Daily Report wrote that [...] "Vice Squad investigators stilled the tape recorders of a free-swinging, a-go-go film and recording studio here Friday and arrested a self-styled movie producer". Zappa was charged with [...] "conspiracy to commit pornography". This felony charge was reduced and he was sentenced to six months in jail on a misdemeanor, with all but ten days suspended. His brief imprisonment left a permanent mark, and was central to the formation of his anti-authoritarian stance. Zappa lost several recordings made at Studio Z in the process, as the police only returned 30 out of 80 hours of tape seized. Eventually, he could no longer afford to pay the rent on the studio and was evicted. Zappa managed to recover some of his possessions before the studio was torn down in 1966.|$|E
500|$|By 2005, Nesbitt {{had become}} {{tired of the}} formula and {{threatened}} to quit unless {{the structure of the}} series was changed. He was made a creative consultant and suggested that Murphy keep one undercover role for a full series, instead of changing into a new guise every episode. This new dramatic element to the series was intended to make it a closer representation of real-life undercover work. Alongside his research with former <b>undercover</b> <b>officer</b> Peter Bleksley, Nesbitt hired a personal trainer and grew a handlebar moustache to change Murphy's physical characteristics and tone down the [...] "cheeky chappie" [...] persona that the audience had become accustomed to from his roles. With his trainer, he worked out three times a week, boxing and doing circuits and weights. After the first new episode was broadcast, Sarah Vine wrote in The Times, [...] "In the past, when attempting a nasty stare or a hard face, Nesbitt has never managed much more than a faintly quizzical look, hilarity forever threatening to break out behind those twinkly Irish eyes. But here, it's different. He genuinely has the air of a man who means business." [...] The refreshed series marked another milestone in Nesbitt's career; he describes it as [...] "a big moment" [...] in his life. Murphy's Law was not recommissioned for a sixth series, which Nesbitt attributed to the damage done to the fifth series ratings when it was scheduled opposite the popular ITV drama Doc Martin.|$|E
2500|$|Following the shooting, Hammond's {{passenger}} {{was issued}} a summons {{for possession of}} [...] of marijuana. Police allege that she had planned {{to sell it to}} an <b>undercover</b> <b>officer</b> who had set up the deal.|$|E
50|$|Police {{harassment}} and entrapment {{of gay men}} was an issue that King was passionate about. In the late 1980s he led efforts {{to change the way}} police officers treated gay men and to stop <b>undercover</b> <b>officers</b> from entrapping gay men.|$|R
50|$|For example, if <b>undercover</b> <b>officers</b> coerced a {{potential}} suspect into manufacturing illegal drugs to sell them, the accused could use entrapment as a defense. However, if a suspect is already manufacturing drugs and police pose as buyers to catch them, entrapment usually has not occurred.|$|R

[...] He allegedly wanted to kill at least 30 people and was also considering targeting an office building in Alexandria, a restaurant, or a synagogue. [...] He is said to have expressed interest in gunning people down [...] "face-to-face." ...|$|E
2500|$|At around 8:20p.m. on July 26, 2015, Hammond, with Morton as his passenger, {{drove his}} 2001 Honda Civic through {{a parking lot}} of a Hardee's restaurant, where the pair were texted by the <b>undercover</b> <b>officer.</b> Tiller was sent as backup for the <b>undercover</b> <b>officer,</b> and when Tiller arrived, he pulled his vehicle in behind Hammond's car in an attempt to block Hammond's escape. According to Tiller's account, Tiller {{approached}} Hammond's car, ordering him to show his hands. Hammond (who was 19 years old and weighed 121 pounds {{at the time of his}} death) [...] panicked and began to drive away from the scene. Tiller claims that Hammond accelerated turning toward [...] the officer, although this is not supported by the dashcam video. Tiller then fired two rounds from his [...]45 caliber handgun at close range through the open driver's side window of Hammond's car as Hammond tried to flee. Bullets struck Hammond in the left chest and left front shoulder. According to a police report, Tiller feared being run over by Hammond's vehicle when he backed it up and then pulled forward toward the officer. As seen in the dashcam video, Tiller was never in the path of Hammond's vehicle. Police contend that Hammond was under the influence of cocaine at the time of his death. However, in a lawsuit filed against Tiller and the Seneca Police Department, testimony suggests that cocaine was planted on Hammond's body after he had been shot and dragged from his car.|$|E
5000|$|The United States, Canada, and Mexico {{had a major}} trilateral {{summit meeting}} {{regarding}} SPP at the Château Montebello in Montebello, Quebec.

The summit is noteworthy because a short 5:23 video uploaded to YouTube led to the eventual police admission of the use of <b>undercover</b> <b>officers</b> disguised as protesters at the summit. Critics charged that the <b>undercover</b> <b>officers</b> were agents provocateurs sent to disrupt the protest by inciting violence.
