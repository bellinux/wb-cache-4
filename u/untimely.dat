5|$|Critics {{compared}} Kilmer to British Catholic writers Hilaire Belloc and G. K. Chesterton—suggesting {{that his}} reputation might {{have risen to}} the level where {{he would have been}} considered their American counterpart if not for his <b>untimely</b> death.|$|E
5|$|On December 4, 2013, The Fast and the Furious team {{released}} a tribute video to Paul Walker after the actor's <b>untimely</b> death, which contained excerpts from Coming Home.|$|E

5|$|After Chitrangada's death {{his young}} brother Vichitravirya was crowned king, while Bhishma ruled {{on his behalf}} (under Satyavati's command) until Vichitravirya grew up. Vichitravirya married the princesses of Kashi-Kosala: Ambika and Ambalika, who were won by Bhishma in a Swayamvara (marriage choice). The childless Vichitravirya met with an <b>untimely</b> death from tuberculosis.|$|E
5|$|Flight 007 {{has been}} the subject of ongoing {{controversy}} and has spawned a number of conspiracy theories. Many of these are based on the suppression of evidence such as the flight data recorders, unexplained details such as the role of a USAF RC-135 surveillance aircraft, the <b>untimely</b> destruction of the U.S. Air Force's King Salmon radar data, or merely Cold War disinformation and propaganda.|$|E
5|$|Michael {{was almost}} 16 {{when his father}} fell fatally ill; the annual trip to Denmark was cancelled. On 1 November 1894, Alexander III died at the <b>untimely</b> age of 49. Michael's eldest brother, Nicholas, became Tsar, and Michael's {{childhood}} was effectively over.|$|E
5|$|Even before Diarmait's demise, the Uí Chennselaig {{began to}} fight amongst {{themselves}} in a struggle that was almost certainly an after-effect of Diarmait's sons' <b>untimely</b> deaths. Specifically, the seventeenth-century Annals of the Four Masters, and the eleventhfourteenth-century Annals of Inisfallen reveal that Domnall battled {{against the forces of}} his own first cousin once removed, Donnchad mac Domnaill Remair (died 1089), before Diarmait's ally, Toirdelbach Ua Briain, King of Munster (died 1086), was able to intervene and restore order in the Kingdom of Leinster.|$|E
5|$|His {{resting place}} {{is at the}} Patriotic Martyrs' Cemetery, in Pyongyang. Today, Cho is {{regarded}} as the founding father of North Korean socialist realist poetry, or indeed poetry in general, or even North Korean literature as a whole. In the mid-1950s many Soviet Koreans, including Cho's close friends, were discredited in purges. According to Gabroussenko, Cho's <b>untimely</b> death in 1951 may have spared him his reputation from that loss of official recognition. With the exception of a period in the 1970s when Cho's name was barely mentioned in official publications, his legacy has benefited from continued popularity in North Korea.|$|E
5|$|Roads in Saint Elizabeth {{sustained}} substantial damage, with 32 separate roads experiencing severe impacts. Throughout the country, a {{total of}} $7.6million (JMD; US$86,000) was provided to repair the roads, $4.23million (JMD; US$48,000) of which was used in Saint Elizabeth alone. Widespread damage to crops also resulted in an increased price in store costs. The loss to farmers was <b>untimely</b> as it followed a three-month drought that was preceded by damaging hailstorms that ruined crops. Following the storm, search and rescue teams were deployed, mainly in Saint Elizabeth Parish following reports of flooding.|$|E
5|$|Shetland's {{culture and}} landscapes have {{inspired}} {{a variety of}} musicians, writers and film-makers. The Forty Fiddlers was formed in the 1950s to promote the traditional fiddle style, which is a vibrant part of local culture today. Notable exponents of Shetland folk music include Aly Bain, Fiddlers' Bid, and the late Tom Anderson and Peerie Willie Johnson. Thomas Fraser was a country musician who never released a commercial recording during his life, but whose work has become popular more than 20 years after his <b>untimely</b> death in 1978.|$|E
5|$|The 1996 {{constitution}} {{establishes a}} second house of parliament, the 100-seat Senate, {{was established in}} April 2013 and is headed by a President of the Senate who is the constitutional successor in case of <b>untimely</b> vacancy of the Presidency of the Republic. The government recognises the authority of traditional chiefs, fons, and lamibe to govern {{at the local level}} and to resolve disputes as long as such rulings do not conflict with national law.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{reportedly}} haunted locations in Washington, D.C. The city is the capital of the United States, and was founded (pursuant to an Act of Congress) on July 16, 1790. The City of Washington was originally a separate municipality within the Territory of Columbia until an act of Congress in 1871 effectively merged George Town, the City of Washington, and the Territory of Columbia into a single entity called the District of Columbia. Washington, D.C., has been the site of military battles, deadly duels, assassinations, <b>untimely</b> deaths, and associated tragedies.|$|E
5|$|Thus Hammurabi {{ascended to}} the throne as the king of a minor kingdom {{in the midst of}} a complex geopolitical situation. The {{powerful}} kingdom of Eshnunna controlled the upper Tigris River while Larsa controlled the river delta. To the east of Mesopotamia lay the powerful kingdom of Elam which regularly invaded and forced tribute upon the small states of southern Mesopotamia. In northern Mesopotamia, the Assyrian king Shamshi-Adad I, who had already inherited centuries old Assyrian colonies in Asia Minor, had expanded his territory into the Levant and central Mesopotamia, although his <b>untimely</b> death would somewhat fragment his empire.|$|E
5|$|Wild had {{thoughts}} of a second, more productive {{season in the}} ice, and took the ship to Cape Town for a refit. Here, in June 1922, he received a message from Rowett ordering the ship home to England, so the expedition ended quietly. The Quest voyage is not greatly regarded in the histories of polar exploration, due to the event that defines it in public memory, overshadowing its other activities: Shackleton's <b>untimely</b> death.|$|E
5|$|Floods are {{the most}} common natural {{disaster}} in India. The heavy southwest monsoon rains cause the Brahmaputra and other rivers to distend their banks, often flooding surrounding areas. Though they provide rice paddy farmers with a largely dependable source of natural irrigation and fertilisation, the floods can kill thousands and displace millions. Excess, erratic, or <b>untimely</b> monsoon rainfall may also wash away or otherwise ruin crops. Almost all of India is flood-prone, and extreme precipitation events, such as flash floods and torrential rains, have become increasingly common in central India over the past several decades, coinciding with rising temperatures. Mean annual precipitation totals have remained steady due to the declining frequency of weather systems that generate moderate amounts of rain.|$|E
5|$|Her death caused {{reactions}} {{not just}} within Saskatchewan and the curling community, but also across the country. Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien {{said in a}} statement: All Canadians have been touched by the <b>untimely</b> death of Sandra Schmirler. Most of us came to know her through her exploits as a champion curler and as an exemplary sports ambassador for Canada. But what really set her apart was her bright, engaging personality and her incredible zest for life, qualities that were so clearly in evidence as she fought so valiantly against her illness. She will be sorely missed. In honour of Schmirler, flags at provincial office buildings in Saskatchewan were lowered to half-staff.|$|E
5|$|In 1521, Portuguese {{explorer}} Ferdinand Magellan {{became the}} first person from Europe to reach Asia by sailing west, a voyage of which he would meet an <b>untimely</b> death in the island of the Philippines. Spain sent expeditions to colonize the East Indies in their competition with Portugal to seize control over the spice trade. However, all of these expeditions failed. It was not until Miguel López de Legazpi, sailing from Mexico with five ships and five hundred men, reached the Philippines in 1565 and a Spanish settlement was established. López de Legazpi was greeted by hostile Muslim tribes opposing a foreign invasion. His attempt {{to land on the}} island of Cebu resulted in the death of one of his soldiers prompting him to explore another island and seek trade with various tribes.|$|E
5|$|In {{the hours}} {{leading up to}} landfall, the TCWC in Brisbane issued 17 cyclone {{warnings}} for coastal areas. According to the BoM, residents received 20 hours of advance warning in which to complete preparations. By late on 23 December, police and ] workers were on alert for the approaching storm. High public preparedness and a relatively low loss of life were attributed to BoM cyclone awareness initiatives {{in the wake of}} 1970's deadly Cyclone Ada. However, storm victims still criticised the agency and local radio news stations for unclear, <b>untimely,</b> or conflicting broadcasts that caused widespread confusion. Significant delays between the issuance of warnings from TCWC Brisbane and local broadcast in the Townsville area raised some question about the need for a warning centre closer to North Queensland.|$|E
5|$|Judy Tyler as Peggy Van Alden, a music {{promoter}} {{who helps}} Vince build {{his career and}} eventually becomes his lover. Tyler was previously known for her part as Princess Summerfall Winterspring in the television show Howdy Doody and her role as Suzy in the Broadway musical Pipe Dream (1955). Tyler took a three-month {{leave of absence from}} Howdy Doody to shoot the movie. Tyler and her husband were both killed in a car crash on July 3, days after production of the movie was completed and before the movie premiered. Presley was so devastated over her <b>untimely</b> death that he refused to watch the film.|$|E
5|$|One {{year after}} Arthur's death, Henry VII renewed his efforts of sealing a marital {{alliance}} with Spain by arranging for Catherine to marry Arthur's brother Henry, who had by then become Prince of Wales. Arthur's <b>untimely</b> death {{paved the way}} for Henry's accession as Henry VIII in 1509. The potential for a question as to the consummation of Arthur and Catherine's marriage, was much later (and in a completely different political context) exploited by Henry and his court to cast doubt on the validity of Catherine's union with Henry, eventually leading to the separation between the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church.|$|E
5|$|Riya has {{suffered}} a number of <b>untimely</b> incidents. During the filming of Shaadi No. 1 in France, she was knocked unconscious after being accidentally {{run over by a}} stuntman's motorbike, but she was not seriously injured. Shortly before the release of Silsiilay, in which she starred opposite her boyfriend Ashmit Patel, a 90-second video clip was circulated on Multimedia Messaging Services and the internet, showing the pair in compromising situations in a hotel bedroom. This was {{one of a number of}} controversies that erupted when celebrities were caught in similar situations using cameraphones. Following this incident, the couple split up, although Riya denied that she was the girl in the MMS clip. One commentator claimed that the footage was an orchestrated publicity stunt. In 2007, she underwent a brief detoxification period in Bangkok for addiction to chocolate.|$|E
5|$|Time Inc was {{the title}} for the {{concluding}} two-part story-arc as to have originally been written by Robert Holmes for episodes 13 & 14 when commissioned on 4 February 1986. However, Holmes was unable {{to work on the}} script past the first part due to his <b>untimely</b> death on 24 May 1986. Script editor Eric Saward was tasked with completing the story, his version of the script ending with the Doctor and the Valeyard locked in battle in the time vortex and no clear victor. This was disapproved by series producer John Nathan-Turner as being too down-beat and would end the show on an inconclusive moment should the BBC decide to cancel the series. The final episode was subsequently commissioned from Pip & Jane Baker by Nathan-Turner after Saward quit as script editor following the rejection of his proposed ending.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Carlotta Joaquina, Queluz saw only {{intermittent}} use as a royal residence and was not again the primary residence of Portuguese royalty. Carlotta Joaquina's son King Miguel used the palace during the three-year civil war which he fought against his brother King Pedro IV, before being forced by his brother in 1834 to abdicate and go into exile. A year later, Pedro IV died of tuberculosis {{at the age of}} 35 at Queluz, the palace of his birth. Pedro I's daughter Maria II ruled until her death in 1853 and was succeeded by her son Pedro V. Following his <b>untimely</b> death in the cholera epidemic of 1861, the throne passed to his brother Luís. From this time the royal family lived chiefly at the rebuilt Ajuda Palace in Lisbon. On the assassination of Luís' son Carlos I in 1908, the palace passed into the ownership of the state. Portugal was in the turmoil of revolution and the monarchy fell two years later.|$|E
5|$|In April 2001, the Schindlers filed {{a motion}} for relief from {{judgment}} citing new evidence of Terri Schiavo's wishes. Judge Greer denied the motion as <b>untimely</b> under Rule 1.540(b)(5) of the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure. The Second District Court of Appeal upheld Greer's decision but remanded the issue {{in order to give}} the Schindlers an opportunity to file a new motion. On April 24, 2001 Terri's feeding tube was removed for the first time. The Schindlers filed a civil suit against Michael Schiavo alleging perjury, which was assigned to another court. The judge, Frank Quesada, issued an injunction against the removal of feeding tube until this was settled. The feeding tube was reinserted on April 26, 2001. On appeal by Michael Schiavo, the Second District Court of Appeal reversed Judge Quesada's order. In the same time frame, Michael Schiavo {{filed a motion}} to enforce the mandate of the guardianship court (that the feeding tube be removed). The Second District Court of Appeal denied the motion. These three decisions, all published in a single order by Florida's Second District Court of Appeal, came to be known by the court as Schiavo II in its later rulings.|$|E
5|$|In July 1907, Dallas {{joined the}} assay {{office of the}} Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company, and also {{enrolled}} in the local technical college, where he took night classes in chemistry and technical drawing. He showed an early interest in aviation, fuelled by the establishment in 1911 of the Mount Morgan chapter of the Queensland Aero Club. Dallas {{and his younger brother}} Norvel built a glider, which was wrecked by an <b>untimely</b> gust of wind the first time they tried to launch it. The two brothers continued to build model gliders in spite of this initial disaster, and Stan corresponded with pioneer aviators in France, England, and the United States. He later transferred to a higher-paying job driving trucks for Iron Island ironstone quarries. Stan and Norvel once again built their own flying machine while Stan was working on Iron Island. They experimented with this seaplane on nearby Marble Island, notorious for its treacherous waters; Stan lost this aeroplane in the sea.|$|E
5|$|Tom Thumb, Fielding's sixth play, {{was added}} to the ninth showing of The Author's Farce, 24 April 1730. Together, the shows lasted at the Haymarket until they were {{replaced}} by Fielding's next production, Rape upon Rape. Tom Thumb was later included with other productions, including Rape upon Rape, and later transformed into the Tragedy of Tragedies. In the print edition, Fielding added footnotes, prefaces, and prologues, which introduced the narratorial style found in Fielding's later works. The plot deals with the English hero, Tom Thumb, who is of only tiny proportions. After defeating a group of giants, Tom Thumb is handsomely rewarded by King Arthur, which later erupts in a comical love triangle between Tom, Arthur's wife Queen Dollalolla, and Princess Huncamunca. Tom is eventually swallowed by a cow and killed. Soon after, his ghost appears but meets an <b>untimely</b> death. This scene reportedly provoked Jonathan Swift to laughter, a rare feat. The farcical nature of Tom Thumb pokes fun at 17th and 18th-century tragedy, gender roles and gender politics.|$|E
5|$|Grant Morrison later {{chose to}} heavily reimagine Kathy Kane in 2011 for his Batman Incorporated series. It is {{established}} that Kathy Kane was born Katherine Webb, {{and that she}} had been an aspiring independent film director prior to marrying a millionaire named Nathan Kane, the son of Roderick and Elizabeth Kane and brother of Martha (Kane) Wayne, Bruce Wayne's mother. Nathan and Kathy were madly in love with one another, and it was Nathan who ended up buying Kathy her circus as a birthday present. After Nathan's <b>untimely</b> death, Kathy was approached by a young man known only as Agent-33, who recruited her into a covert spy organization called Spyral. As part of her first assignment, Kathy was tasked with tracking down Batman and discovering his true identity. Donning a female variation of Batman's costume in order to gain his attention, she embarked on a career as a costumed crime-fighter while attempting to get close to Batman. Her plan succeeded but the two fell in love with one another, despite Kathy legally being Wayne's aunt. As a result, she refused to reveal his identity to her superiors at Spyral. Later, Kathy was confronted by the head of Spyral, a Nazi supervillain named Dr. Dedalus (Otto Netz) who claimed to be her real father and threatened to expose her to Batman unless she continued her mission. Heartbroken, she broke off her relationship with Bruce in order to save him from Dedalus' plan. In the present, Batman and the South American vigilante El Gaucho are told by the villainess Scorpiana that El Gaucho was responsible for Kathy's murder, as he had originally been Agent-33 prior to becoming a superhero. Batman tells Gaucho that Scorpiana must be lying since Kathy had been killed by the League of Assassins, but Gaucho claims that there is some truth in her accusations, and that Batman wouldn't understand. In the follow-up one-shot Batman Incorporated: Leviathan Strikes, students of an assassin training facility masquerading as St. Hadrian's Finishing School For Girls in England are shown wearing variations of Kathy's Batwoman costume, with the original masks replaced by skulls. Later, these women are shown to be agents of Spyral, dedicated to hunting down Talia al Ghul, whose organisation Leviathan is waging war with Batman. Kathy reappears alive in the concluding issue of Batman Incorporated, in which she shoots Talia al Ghul dead in the Batcave. Identifying herself as St Hadrian's headmistress and requesting Batman not to go looking for her, she thanks Batman for leading Talia into her trap and reports to Spyral headquarters that one more international criminal has been killed.|$|E
