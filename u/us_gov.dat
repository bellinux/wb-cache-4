6000|$|You next {{remark that}} Abolitionism does not predominate at the North. I admit {{that for many}} years it did not, but lately it has {{acquired}} an ascendency & is now wielding its baneful influence {{on the minds of}} the masses. It is true there are many good people there whose minds are too pure to be tainted by such an almost infidel spirit as pervades the breasts of Abolitionists; yet the party in power has been elevated by such vast majorities of the people, in that section, that, to one investigating the matter, it seems the public sentiment at the North has greatly changed in the last few years. In such a country as ours--a democratic one--the masses are governed by a few great leaders; these leaders, whether in power or not, are still the almost despots who rule us. Their actions give fruit and coloring to the character of the sections over which they sway their autocratic sceptres. Who then can doubt the Aboli^n propensities of the N. when such men as Beecher, Greeley, Webb, Phillips, Sumner, & a host of kindred spirits, are the giant levers in the machinery of their society? It will not do to say that these are disregarded by sensible people there, for I know too well their power for evil. I know that Dr. Hodge--a man whom I love next to my Father--stated, in his article on [...] "the state of the Country," [...] {{that he did not know}} of 12 abolitionists [...] "within the circle of his acquaintance." [...] But the Dr. was either woefully mistaken or he didn't consider his pupils as belonging to that circle; for to my certain knowledge there were twice that number within the walls of [...] "Princeton" [...] at the time he made the assertion, and many of these avowedly such--men who, I was astonished to see, withheld their names when the same Dr. H. came round with a petition to Congress for [...] "the restoration of the Mis. Comp." [...] & the repeal of the [...] "Personal Liberty Bills." [...] These young men were embryo Ministers--men whose moral influence must be powerful for good or for evil. How is it then you can assert that the North don't want the extinction of slavery when such men as I have mentioned exert every effort to prevent its extension & not that only, but the operation of the fugitive S. law? I am aware that you stated the contrary in your letter--that the North are ever [...] "rigorous" [...] in its execution; nor am I so ungallant as to doubt your veracity; but I think you have not fully informed yourself on this point, else you would have learned that in scarcely an isolated case has the Master ever recovered his property without being put to more expense & trouble than the negro was worth; although I am free to admit, that at the same time it cost the <b>U.S.</b> <b>gov.</b> an equal if not greater Amount. Of course I refer to those negroes who have not merely crossed the limits of a Slave State, & thus been caught, but gone some distance North. Now the obligation to restore a fugitive Slave is a constitu^l. & moral obligation; and those laws designed to prevent such restoration are unconst^l & criminal--and worthy of all condem^n.--and unbecoming the dignity of any Sov^n. State. If people of any State can't conscientiously submit to the Constitution there are only 2 courses: they should endeavor to have it peaceably altered, or should move out of the Country. This is the opinion of the most learned and liberal men. They have no right to live under the protec^n. of a Const^n. & yet refuse to submit to its stipulations. True enough, as you say, the North wish not to have the Negroes set free in their midst, to overrun and disturb them--this they declare by their actions, for they take no care for or interest in the poor free (almost) brutes in their midst;--yet how soon will they be ready to resist you most violently should you attempt to take even one of them back, from his then wretched abode, to his former happier place in the service of a kind Master? [...] "Oh! consistency, thou art a jewel!" [...] This then has been one of the two great causes of the present troubles. The other--the denial of equal rights in the Territories--is still a greater, because it involves a principle; the former was more a matter of personal interest. The territories being purchased in common, were the com. pos. of North and South. Each had a Const^l right to emigrate thither with their property & demand for it the protection afforded by the Const^n. It became, in course of time, a matter of dispute whether the South could take their slaves there as property. (As a matter of course this arose from jealousy--the N. having no such prop, to take.) This great quest. was decided, however, by the Chief Justice in the highest Tribunal in the world, in favor of the South; viz. that slaves were property. I refer to the [...] "Dred Scott" [...] Case. This should have been sufficient, as it came from the highest authority in the Gov^t. But some parties and people are never satisfied. Full in the face of this high official the Repub^n Party declare by their Platform orators, & Press, that slavery shall never enter another foot of territory. Now if the South admit this principle they acknowledge their inferiority to the North--an act that, even in the eyes of the North, would not comport with their dignity & honor as an independent & free people. The South being thus oppressed then I assert they have a right (not to secede, for no such right exists in my conception, as it would be an element subversive of any, & especially of a Repub^ln gov.,) to revolt--a right inherent in & beyond the control of all earthly govern^ts. Yes I coincide with the great Lord Chatham when he says that [...] "Rebellion against oppression is obedience to God." [...] Our Ancestors rebelled against the tyranny of British usurpation, & the Texans revolted against a like despotism exercised by a Mexican Autocrat. Why then are the Sovereign States of America not justifiable in throwing off the yoke or rather resisting to have put upon them, the yoke, of Northern Tyranny? To make the argument still clearer, however, as to the Territories, let us illustrate it: Suppose a Repub^n. Congress decides that slavery shan't be protected in the Ter. as prop. I take my slave thither. An indictment is brought against me. I am tried and condemned by the territorial court. I appeal from its decision to the Sup. Court of the U.S. What then? From analogy I conclude that I shall be acquitted, i.e., recover my property. For one Chief Justice has already decided thus; and is not his decision final? Here then is an end of the matter; since the Sup. Court is the Sole Arbiter in determining the Constitutionality of any of Congress' acts.|$|E

The syndrome is highly prevalent in the United States and worldwide, and treatments are in high demand. ProAlgaZyme, a novel and proprietary freshwater algae infusion in purified water, {{has been the subject of}} several animal studies and has demonstrated low toxicity even with chronic administration at elevated doses. The infusion has been used historically for the treatment of several inflammatory and immune disorders in humans and is considered well-tolerated. Here, the infusion is evaluated for its effects on the cardiovascular risk factors present in metabolic syndrome in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study involving 60 overweight and obese persons, ages 25 – 60. All participants received four daily oral doses (1 fl oz) of ProAlgaZyme (N = 22) or water placebo (N = 30) for a total of 10 weeks, and were encouraged to maintain their normal levels of physical activity. Blood sampling and anthropometric measurements were taken at the beginning of the study period and after 4, 8 and 10 weeks of treatment. Eight participants did not complete the study.

Due to the modest results obtained and in order to improve our intervention we need to know the GPs' attitudes towards patients with MUS, their experience, expectations and the utility of the communication techniques we proposed and the feasibility of implementing them. Physicians who took part in 2 different training programs and in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) for patients with MUS were questioned to ascertain the reasons for the doctors' participation in the trial and the attitudes, experiences and expectations of GPs about the intervention. Methods A qualitative study based on four focus groups with GPs who took part in a RCT. A content analysis was carried out. Results Following the RCT patients are perceived as true suffering persons, and the relationship with them has improved in GPs of both groups. GPs mostly valued {{the fact that it is}} highly structured, that it made possible a more comfortable relationship and that it could be applied to a broad spectrum of patients with psychosocial problems. Nevertheless, all participants consider that change in patients is necessary; GPs in the intervention group remarked that that is extremely difficult to achieve. Conclusion GPs positively evaluate the communication techniques and the interventions that help in understanding patient suffering, and express the enormous difficulties in handling change in patients. These findings provide information on the direction in which efforts for improving intervention should be directed. Trial registration <b>US</b> ClinicalTrials. <b>gov</b> NCT 00130988 </p...|$|R

This {{work was done}} to study the profile of clinical research in Egypt in three CT registries with different scopes: the WHO International CT Registry Platform (ICTRP), the continental Pan-African CT Registry (PACTR) and the <b>US</b> clinicaltrials. <b>gov</b> (CTGR). In March 2014, ICTRP, PACTR and CTGR were searched for clinical studies conducted in Egypt. It {{was found that the}} number of studies conducted in Egypt (percentage) was 686 (0. 30 %) in ICTRP, 56 (11. 3 %) in PACTR and 548 (0. 34 %) in CTGR. Most studies were performed in universities and sponsored by university/organization, industry or individual researchers. Inclusion of adults from both genders predominated. The median number of participants per study in the three registries ranged between 63 and 155. The conditions researched differed among the three registries and study purpose was mostly treatment followed by prevention. Endpoints were mostly efficacy followed by safety. Observational:Interventional studies (i. e. {{clinical trials}}) represented 15. 5 %: 84. 5 % in ICTRP, 0 %: 100 % in PACTR and 16. 4 %: 83. 6 % in CTGR. Most interventions were drugs or procedures. Observational studies were mostly prospective and cohort studies. Most CTs were phase 3 and tested drugs or procedures. Parallel group assignment and random allocation predominated. Blinding was implemented in many of trials and was mostly double-blind. We conclude that CTs from Egypt in trial registries are apparently low and do not accurately reflect clinical research conducted in Egypt or its potential. Development of an Egyptian CT registry is eagerly needed. Registering all Egyptian CTs in public domains is highly recommended...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Few {{innovative}} anti-microbial {{products have}} been brought to market in recent years to combat the global multidrug resistant-tuberculosis (MDR-TB) epidemic. Bedaquiline, a novel oral diarylquinoline, was approved by the US FDA as a part of combination therapy in adults with pulmonary MDR-TB based on phase II trials. Area covered: Pubmed searches were conducted using search terms bedaquiline, diarylquinoline, R 207910, and TMC 207 was performed. Supplementary sources included World Health Organization, Clinicaltrial. <b>gov,</b> <b>US</b> Food and Drug Administration. Bedaquiline is an ATP synthase inhibitor specific for M. tuberculosis and some nontuberculous mycobacteria. It is metabolized by CYP 3 A 4 and it's drug exposure can be influenced by inducers and inhibitors of this enzyme. Phase II studies showed promising results on efficacy of bedaquiline when being used in combination with a background regimen for MDR-TB. Main safety concerns include QTc prolongation and hepatotoxicity. Phase III trials are ongoing to confirm efficacy findings from phase II studies and provide additional evidence of safety and efficacy. Expert commentary: Critical data for long-term efficacy and safety are incomplete and scarce, supporting the cautious use of bedaquiline...|$|R

40|$|Background A 2003 survey {{suggested}} {{the number of}} noncommercial trials in the UK was declining. Formation of the NIHR in 2006 and increased research spending by the Department of Health may have {{increased the number of}} noncommercial trials but no data are available. Methods Available data on UK noncommercial trials (were obtained from the two relevant registries: ISRCTN register for the UK, and <b>US</b> ClinicalTrials. <b>gov.</b> Data on each trial were sorted by start year, and compared with the: 2003 survey, and UKCRN portfolio database from 2007. Results The number of UK noncommercial trials registered rose from 25 in 1990 to 188 in 1999, peaked at 533 in 2003, and fell back to 334 in 2009. Total trials registered was similar to but slightly above those in the 2003 survey up to 1998, then rose sharply to 2002 before falling to 2007. From 2007 to 2009 the number registered to start each year was similar to but slightly above the UKCRN database. Less than 10 % of UK noncommercial trials registered with ClinGov for most years before 2005, but this rose to 35 % by 2009. Conclusions For the periods of overlap, trial registration data provide fairly similar totals to other sources on the number of noncommercial trials starting each year. The rise and fall in the number of trials registered between 1999 and 2007 was due to those registered in the ISRCTN database as funded by NHS Trusts. After 2007, the number of trials registered as funded by NHS Trusts has fallen in the ISRCTN register but these trials may have migrated to the US ClinGov register. The total number of noncommercial trial starts, excluding those funded by NHS Trusts, has been upward since around 2002. By 2009 the two main funders were NIHR and charities. Feasibility of using registration data to monitor the number of noncommercial trials has been demonstrated but is complicated by the use of two registers and difficulties in accessing the data.

40|$|Crataegus spp. (hawthorn) monopreparations are {{predominantly}} used for treating congestive heart failure. The effectiveness of hawthorn preparations (flowers with leaves; berries) is documented {{in a number}} of clinical studies, reviews and meta-analyses. The aim {{of this article is to}} assess the safety data of all available human studies on hawthorn monopreparations. Systematic searches were conducted on MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, The Cochrane Library, the UK National Research Register and the <b>US</b> ClinicalTrials. <b>gov</b> (up to January 2005). Data were requested from the spontaneous reporting scheme of the WHO. Hand searches were also conducted in a sample of relevant medical journals, conference proceedings, reference lists of identified articles and our own files. Eight manufacturers of hawthorn-containing preparations were contacted and asked to supply any information on adverse events or drug interactions. Data from all clinical studies and reports were assessed. Only human studies on monopreparations were included. Data from hawthorn-containing combination preparations and homeopathic preparations were excluded. All studies were read and evaluated by one reviewer and independently verified by at least one additional reviewer. Twenty-nine clinical studies were identified, of which 24 met our inclusion criteria. A total of 7311 patients were enrolled, and data from 5577 patients were available for analysis. The daily dose and duration of treatment with hawthorn monopreparations ranged from 160 to 1800 mg and from 3 to 24 weeks, respectively. The extracts most used in the clinical trials were WS 1442 (extract of hawthorn standardised to 18. 75 % oligomeric procyanidins) and LI 132 (extract of hawthorn standardised to 2. 25 % flavonoids). Overall, 166 adverse events were reported. Most of these adverse events were, in general, mild to moderate; eight severe adverse events have been reported with the LI 132 extract. The most frequent adverse events were dizziness/vertigo (n = 15), gastrointestinal complaints (n = 24), headache (n = 9), migraine (n = 8) and palpitation (n = 11). The WHO spontaneous reporting scheme received 18 case reports. In the identified trials, the most frequent adverse events were dizziness (n = 6), nausea (n = 5), fall (n = 2), gastrointestinal haemorrhage (n = 2), circulation failure (n = 2) and erythematous rash (n = 2). There were no reports of drug interactions. In conclusion, all data reviewed in this article seem to indicate that hawthorn is well tolerated even if some severe adverse events were reported; this suggests that further studies are needed to better assess the safety of hawthorn-containing preparations. Moreover, the unsupervised use of this drug can be associated with problems, especially if given with concomitant medications...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{undertake}} {{a survey of}} the world's clinical trial registries to provide current data on the number, nature, funding source and geographical distribution of pregnancy drug trials (PDT). Design and setting: Comprehensive analysis of WHO-certified clinical trial registries. Methods Sixteen registries containing 301 538 trials (168 826 active in 2013 – 2014) were analysed to identify the numbers, location, funding sources, and areas of interest/development of PDTs. Results: The percentage of PDTs varied from 0 to 7. 4 % across registries. Overall, just 0. 32 % (534) of all active registered studies were PDTs. The <b>US</b> registry (Clinicaltrials. <b>gov)</b> was the largest database, but contributed just 14 % of all active PDTs. The majority of PDTs focused on anaesthesia/analgesia, preterm birth/tocolysis, labour induction, endocrine and hypertensive disorders. Less than 6 % of active PDTs focused on maternal or fetal health as a specific primary outcome, and only 4. 4 % included a preplanned pharmacokinetic analysis of the trial medications. A third of all active PDTs involved repurposing of existing medicines for applications in pregnancy, whereas only three new investigational drugs had been developed for a pregnancy indication. Seven percent of all active PDTs identified were pharmaceutical industry-funded. Inter-disease comparisons identified a ~ 50 -fold disparity in trial activity between pregnancy and other comparable areas. Conclusions: This study demonstrates unequivocally the marked under-representation of medication development, evaluation and safety trials in pregnancy. The likelihood that the current pharmaceutical landscape in pregnancy will improve in the foreseeable future is slim. Advocacy and increased awareness of the issue is necessary to achieve positive change. Tweetable abstract: Pregnant women are significantly under-represented in global clinical drug trials.

40|$|Monitoring lung {{function}} in at-risk populations enables {{the identification of}} individuals with excessive decline. Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) is the measure best suited for monitoring changes in {{lung function}} over time. An excessive decline in FEV 1 over several years {{has been associated with}} increased respiratory morbidity, loss of productivity at an earlier age, and increased mortality. SPIROLA's Role: The Spirometry Longitudinal Data Analysis (SPIROLA) software is an integrated visual and quantitative tool that aids in monitoring lung function in individuals over time. To identify individuals with excessive decline in lung function accurately and in a timely manner, it is important to maintain acceptable quality of the spirometry tests and precision of the longitudinal spirometry data. Additionally, identification of excessive decline followed by appropriate interventions may help to preserve an individual's lung function. SPIROLA allows the user to: 1. monitor the quality of spirometry tests. 2. monitor longitudinal data precision. 3. determine if an individual has excessive lung function decline. 4. collect information on potential risk factors. 5. plan, record, and evaluate the effect of intervention strategies.

40|$|Abstract Background Calm, {{compassionate}} clinicians comfort others. To {{evaluate the}} direct psychophysiologic benefits of non-verbal communication of compassion (NVCC), {{it is important}} to minimize the effect of subjects' expectation. This preliminary study was designed to a) test the feasibility of two strategies for maintaining subject blinding to non-verbal communication of compassion (NVCC), and b) determine whether blinded subjects would experience psychophysiologic effects from NVCC. Methods Subjects were healthy volunteers who were told the study was evaluating the effect of time and touch on the autonomic nervous system. The practitioner had more than 10 years' experience with loving-kindness meditation (LKM), a form of NVCC. Subjects completed 10 -point visual analog scales (VAS) for stress, relaxation, and peacefulness before and after LKM. To assess physiologic effects, practitioners and subjects wore cardiorespiratory monitors to assess respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) throughout the 4 10 -minute study periods: Baseline (both practitioner and subjects read neutral material); non-tactile-LKM (subjects read while the practitioner practiced LKM while pretending to read); tactile-LKM (subjects rested while the practitioner practiced LKM while lightly touching the subject on arms, shoulders, hands, feet, and legs); Post-Intervention Rest (subjects rested; the practitioner read). To assess blinding, subjects were asked after the interventions what the practitioner was doing during each period (reading, touch, or something else). Results Subjects' mean age was 43. 6 years; all were women. Blinding was maintained and the practitioner was able to maintain meditation for both tactile and non-tactile LKM interventions as reflected in significantly reduced RR. Despite blinding, subjects' VAS scores improved from baseline to post-intervention for stress (5. 5 vs. 2. 2), relaxation (3. 8 vs. 8. 8) and peacefulness (3. 8 vs. 9. 0, P Conclusion It is possible to test the effects of LKM with tactile and non-tactile blinding strategies; even with blinding in this small preliminary study, subjects reported significant improvements in well-being which were reflected in objective physiologic measures of autonomic activity. Extending compassion is not only good care; it may also be good medicine. Trial registration number <b>US</b> National ClinicalTrials. <b>gov</b> registration number, NCT 01428674 </p...|$|R

It looks at the history and development of the Relocatable Building industry with particular focus on their application and use in the Province of Ontario, within the larger North American context. Familiar typologies under the umbrella of relocatable buildings include: Manufactured Homes, Emergency Shelters, Portable Classrooms and Industrial Accommodations 1. Of these categories, the latter two will be the focus addressed within this work. The majority of relocatable buildings are manufactured and constructed without the direct involvement of the architectural profession. Many of these buildings barely meet the basic requirements of health, safety, durability, and occupant comfort that is expected of contemporary construction for all other occupied building typologies 2. This problematic building type needs to garner greater attention from designers, regulators and building officials in order to set in place the framework for clearer regulatory guidelines and requirements for these structures. Such a framework has the potential to lead to overall improvement of the quality of construction and product delivery within this sector. This thesis illustrates proposed modifications of the primary documents which set the current regulatory framework for these buildings in Canada: the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) Z 240 Standard for Manufactured Homes 3; the Canadian Standards Association CSA A 277 Standards for Factory Built Buildings; the Ontario Building Code (OBC) 2012 edition 4; and the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC) 2010 edition 5. Amendments amassed from existing precedent codes and model voluntary standards, intend to increase and improve the baseline expectations and requirements of building construction in this category with the intent of directly improving the quality of product being generated by this billion dollar annual Canadian industry. The goal being that design and construction improvements based on changes in regulation, extend to benefit the lives, and day-to-day experiences, of users and occupants of these relocatable structures. This thesis examines the potential, details and positive outcomes for revising the OBC to reflect the addition of this new chapter to the code. 1 www. modular. org Modular Building Institute 2 www. epa. <b>gov</b> <b>US</b> EPA Study on Portable Classrooms 3 www. csagroup. org Canadian Standards Association 4 www. mah. gov. on. ca Ontario Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing 5 www. nrc-cnrc. gc. ca/eng/solutions/advisory/codes_centre_index. html National Building Code of Canad...|$|R
40|$|The {{public sector}} {{collects}} and generates {{vast amounts of}} data. In recent years the interest in re-using public, non-personal data has been increasing among citizens, groups and companies outside the public sector. The media, civil society groups, businesses and private citizens can use public data as "raw material" to create new services, new insight and economic value. Efficient re-use of public data requires that public sector agencies inform about their data sources and make data available in relevant formats. Practice varies strongly between Norwegian public sector agencies in different subject areas and across administrative levels (state/regional/local), this fact finding project from August to December 2009 has revealed. Some agencies offer detailed information about their data sources and have made data available for download. However, {{a major part of}} the agencies assessed offer insufficient or no information about data sources on the homepage of their websites. Here a fundamental requirement for the re-use of data is missing. The impression of varying interest and unused potential is amplified by the results of a survey among state agencies. Two thirds of respondents say their agency possesses data with potential for re-use that is not utilized today. The survey on the other hand suggests that the subject of open data is on the agenda in many agencies; more than six out of ten say they plan to make more data available for re-use during the coming year. The survey shows that increased costs and the concern that external groups will misunderstand the data and misinform the public are cited as the two greatest obstacles against more data being made available. In addition, interviews with public sector agency employees suggest that the topic of making data available is new to some agencies. A comparison with initiatives and debates about open public data in a selection of other countries (Britain, Denmark, Netherlands, USA) show that the attention the topic receives is greatest when it is placed on the agenda at the highest political level. The report recommends a number of concrete measures that it is assumed would quickly increase the selection of data sets made available for re-use. A website that collects public data sources, inspired by the <b>US</b> government's data. <b>gov,</b> would be an obviously efficient initiative, especially when accompanied by a set of clear principles and rules and an "instruction manual" that describes how to make data available in a secure and user-friendly way. The report also points out the need for a parallel, ongoing debate about criteria for the constructive re-use of data. The media should, in cooperation with the public, play a leading role by producing examples of best practices in re-using open data...|$|R
