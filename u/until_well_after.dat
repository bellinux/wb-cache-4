5|$|In {{spite of}} Parchevich's efforts, {{conditions}} {{would not be}} favourable to a Bulgarian anti-Ottoman uprising <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>after</b> his death. While on a diplomatic mission to Pope Clement X, he died of illness in Rome {{in the summer of}} 1674 and was buried at the Sant'Andrea delle Fratte basilica in the city. Parchevich's letters and reports have been preserved and are an important source of information regarding his activities.|$|E
5|$|Incidents {{had also}} {{occurred}} in the Soviet space program, but due to the government's policy of secrecy, these were not disclosed <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>after</b> the Apollo 1 fire. Cosmonaut Valentin Bondarenko died on March 23, 1961, from burns sustained in a fire while participating in a 15-day endurance experiment in a high-oxygen isolation chamber, {{less than three weeks}} before the first Vostok manned space flight; this was disclosed on January 28, 1986.|$|E
5|$|Nick Saban {{resigned}} as Toledo's head coach on February 13, 1991, after one season to become defensive {{coordinator of the}} National Football League's Cleveland Browns under Bill Belichick. As defensive coordinator for the New York Giants, Belichick had to postpone assembling his new coaching staff until after Super Bowl XXV. Therefore, Saban's resignation wasn't announced <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>after</b> the season had ended. Additionally, Saban wanted any potential move to occur after February 6, National Signing Day for recruits.|$|E

50|$|Despite great college success, Witte {{never played}} {{professional}}ly {{because there were}} no viable professional leagues during that time. The Basketball Association of America (BAA) would not even exist <b>until</b> 1946, <b>well</b> <b>after</b> Witte's prime.|$|R
5|$|Along with Annie Smith Peck, Workman was {{recognized}} {{during the early}} 20th century {{as one of the}} most famous female climbers in the world. Their rivalry demonstrated that women could climb the most remote and difficult terrain on the planet. Women had climbed regularly in the Alps since the 1850s, but in the Himalayas, mountaineering had been dominated by wealthy English men. No other women, however, climbed in the Himalaya <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>after</b> World War I, by which time improvements in equipment and organization had shifted that nature of risks and difficulties of expeditions.|$|E
5|$|American {{public opinion}} blamed the {{violence}} on British interference in American affairs through financial and munitions {{support for the}} Indians. This led to a further deterioration of relations with Britain and was a catalyst of the War of 1812, which began six months later. By the time the US declared war on the United Kingdom in June 1812, Tecumseh's confederacy was ready to launch its war against the United States in alliance with the British. In preparation, the Natives soon rebuilt Prophetstown. Frontier violence in the region would continue <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>after</b> the War of 1812, although Tecumseh was killed in 1813 during the Battle of the Thames.|$|E
5|$|The CPS men served without {{wages and}} minimal {{support from the}} federal government. The cost of {{maintaining}} the CPS camps and providing {{for the needs of}} the men was the responsibility of their congregations and families. CPS men served longer than regular draftees and were not released <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>after</b> the end of the war. Initially skeptical of the program, government agencies learned to appreciate the men's service and requested more workers from the program. CPS made significant contributions to forest fire prevention, erosion and flood control, medical science and reform of the mental health system.|$|E
50|$|Áed Ua Forréid was Bishop of Armagh from 1032-1056. He {{was from}} the Cenél Tigernaig branch of the {{northern}} Uí Néill kin-group of Cenél nÉogain. The see was not elevated to an archbishopric <b>until</b> 1106, <b>well</b> <b>after</b> his death.|$|R

50|$|The movie El Dorado, {{starring}} John Wayne and Robert Mitchum, {{takes place}} in this city during the late 1800s. However, El Dorado did not exist <b>until</b> 1895, <b>well</b> <b>after</b> the date John Wayne's El Dorado was supposedly set in a fictional Texas town.|$|R
5|$|The {{depositions}} that Hutchinson {{collected and}} sent to London were eventually published in a pamphlet entitled A Fair Account of the Late Unhappy Disturbance in Boston. Drawn mainly from depositions by soldiers, its account of affairs sought to blame selfish Bostonians for denying the validity of Parliamentary laws. It also blamed the city's hoodlums and gangs for the lawlessness preceding the event, and claimed that they set up an ambush of the soldiers. However, as it was not published <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>after</b> the first pamphlet had arrived in London, it ended up having a much smaller {{impact on the public}} debate there.|$|E
5|$|Jaime I {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Sociedad Española de Construcción Naval {{shipyard}} in Ferrol on 5 February 1912. She was launched on 21 September 1914, {{less than two months}} after the start of World War I. Spain remained neutral during the conflict, but because Britain supplied much of the armament and other building materials, work on Jaime I was considerably delayed. The ship was ready to go to sea by 1917, but she was not completed <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>after</b> the end of the war; work was finally finished on 20 December 1921. Upon her completion, she joined her two sister ships in the 1st Squadron of the Spanish fleet. Jaime I saw action against insurgents in Morocco in the Rif War during the early 1920s along with her two sisters. Rif insurgents operating a coastal battery damaged the ship in 1924.|$|E
5|$|Most {{shooting}} {{was done at}} the Arthur Ranch in the San Francisco Valley, which was used as Aunt Elizabeth's estate for interior and exterior scenes. Beginning at the Arthur Ranch shoot, Grant and Hepburn often ad-libbed their dialogue and frequently delayed production by making each other laugh. The scene where Grant frantically asks Hepburn where his bone is was shot from 10 am <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>after</b> 4 pm because of the stars' laughing fits. After one month of shooting Hawks was seven days behind schedule. During the filming, Hawks would refer to four {{different versions of the}} film's script and make frequent changes to scenes and dialogue. His leisurely attitude on set and shutting down production to see a horse race contributed to the time it took to film, and he took twelve days to shoot the Westlake jail scene instead of the scheduled five. Hawks later facetiously blamed the setbacks on his two stars' laughing fits and having to work with two animal actors.|$|E
50|$|Gerberga (1045/65-1115), also spelled Gerberge or Gerburge, was the Countess of Provence {{for more}} than a decade, until 1112.

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 13 October, Warren sighted two of the French frigates {{standing}} out of Donegal Bay and went after them, directing Moore in Melampus to stay behind to search for stragglers. Hindered by contrary winds, Melampus scoured the bay <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>after</b> nightfall, and at 23:30 {{was surprised by the}} sudden appearance directly in front of her of Immortalité and Résolue near St. John's Point. Immortalité soon spotted Melampus and made sail, but Captain Bargeau of Résolue had not seen the British ship, and was hesitant about following his compatriot in the dark. In the gloom and confusion, he mistook Melampus for Immortalité and came alongside, only realising his mistake when Melampus opened fire. Because of the heavy seas, Résolues guns had been tied down below decks, so the only return fire she could offer was from her handful of quarterdeck guns. Bargeau, whose ship was still leaking badly, recognised that further resistance was futile and surrendered in minutes, having lost ten men and much of his rigging. Melampus put aboard a prize crew and then departed in pursuit of Immortalité.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Civil War greatly {{affected}} Georgetown as 1,141students {{and alumni}} enlisted in one army or the other, and the Union Army commandeered university buildings. By {{the time of}} President Abraham Lincoln's May 1861 visit to campus, 1,400troops were living in temporary quarters there. Due {{to the number of}} lives lost in the war, enrollment levels remained low <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>after</b> the war. Only seven students graduated in 1869, down from over 300 in the previous decade. When the Georgetown College Boat Club was founded in 1876, the school's rowing team, it adopted blue, used for Union uniforms, and gray, used for Confederate uniforms, as its colors to signify the peaceful unity among students. Subsequently, the school adopted these as its official colors.|$|E
5|$|Japan's bomb-damaged {{cities were}} rebuilt after the war. War damage {{and the need}} to rehouse {{soldiers}} and civilians returning from overseas resulted in a shortage of 4.2million units of housing which, combined with food shortages, led to many civilians being forced to live in harsh conditions. In September 1945 the Japanese government offered to provide material for 300,000 small temporary houses to evacuees, but the emphasis of its policies in this year and 1946 was to stop people returning to the damaged cities. The reconstruction of 115 cities began in 1946, and this work was conducted in line with guidelines developed by the Japanese government. The Allied occupation authorities were not involved in the urban rebuilding effort, but allowed this work to go ahead despite criticizing it as inappropriate to Japan's status as a defeated country. Requisitions of land and buildings for use by the occupation force and a requirement that the Japanese government prioritize the construction of housing for the Allied troops interfered with reconstruction, however. In many cities rebuilding was accompanied by a process of land readjustment which sought to improve the urban layout, though the success of both such readjustment and rebuilding programs varied between locations. Overall, most of the new buildings constructed were of poor quality, and it was not <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>after</b> the war that major urban improvement projects were undertaken.|$|E
50|$|Honecker {{was married}} three times. After being liberated {{from prison in}} 1945 he married the prison warden Charlotte Schanuel (née Drost), nine years his senior, on 23 December 1946.

5|$|Young led his {{league in}} wins five times (1892, 1895, and 19011903), {{finishing}} second twice. His career high was 36 in 1892. He had fifteen seasons with twenty or more wins, two {{more than the}} runners-up, Christy Mathewson and Warren Spahn. Young won two ERA titles during his career, in 1892 (1.93) and in 1901 (1.62), and was three times the runner-up. Young's earned run average was below 2.00 six times, {{but this was not}} uncommon during the dead-ball era. Although Young threw over 400 innings in each of his first four full seasons, he did not lead his league until 1902. He had 40 or more complete games nine times. Young also led his league in strikeouts twice (with 140 in 1896, and 158 in 1901), and in shutouts seven times. Young led his league in fewest walks per nine innings thirteen times and finished second one season. Only twice in his 22-year career did Young finish lower than 5th in the category. Although the WHIP ratio was not calculated <b>until</b> <b>well</b> <b>after</b> Young's death, Young was the retroactive league leader in this category seven times and was second or third another seven times. Young is tied with Roger Clemens for the most career wins by a Boston Red Sox pitcher. They each won 192 games while with the franchise.|$|E
