2500|$|Wood heat {{continues}} {{to be used in}} areas where firewood is abundant. [...] For serious attempts at heating, rather than mere ambience (open fireplaces), stoves, fireplace inserts, and furnaces are most commonly used today. [...] In rural, forested parts of the U.S., freestanding boilers are increasingly common. [...] They are installed outdoors, some distance from the house, and connected to a heat exchanger in the house using <b>underground</b> <b>piping.</b> [...] The mess of wood, bark, smoke, and ashes is kept outside and the risk of fire is reduced. [...] The boilers are large enough to hold a fire all night, and can burn larger pieces of wood, so that less cutting and splitting is required. [...] There is no need to retrofit a chimney in the house. [...] However, outdoor wood boilers emit more wood smoke and associated pollutants than other wood-burning appliances. [...] This is due to design characteristics such as the water-filled jacket surrounding the firebox, which acts to cool the fire and leads to incomplete combustion. [...] Outdoor wood boilers also typically have short stack heights in comparison to other wood-burning appliances, contributing to ambient levels of particulates at ground level. [...] An alternative that is increasing in popularity are wood gasification boilers, which burn wood at very high efficiencies (85-91%) and can be placed indoors or in an outbuilding. There are plenty of ways to process wood fuel and the inventions today are maximizing by the minute.|$|E

50|$|There are 52 {{homes in}} this {{subdivision}} that contain {{an array of}} 800 solar thermal collectors. These solar collectors are arranged on the roofs of garages located behind the homes. During a typical summer day these collectors can generate 1.5 mega-watts of thermal power. A glycol solution (an anti-freeze solution; a mixture of water and non-toxic glycol) is heated by the sun’s energy and travels through insulated <b>piping</b> <b>underground</b> through a trench system to the heat exchanger within the community’s Energy Centre. This {{is known as the}} Solar Collector Loop. The glycol solution then transfers its heat to water located in the short-term storage tanks. The District Heating Loop begins with water being heated in the heat exchanger to a temperature of 40-50 °C within the Energy Centre. This lower temperature is more energy efficient, as solar collecting is more compatible with lower temperatures. This increases the total amount of heat available to each home.|$|R
40|$|Radioactive wastes are {{confined}} in 49 underground storage tanks at the Savannah River Site. The waste is transported between tanks primarily via an <b>underground</b> transfer <b>piping</b> system. Due to the hazardous {{nature of the}} waste, the inner core stainless steel pipe is typically surrounded by a carbon steel pipe jacket, which provides secondary containment. Recently several through-wall penetrations were discovered on a segment {{of one of the}} jackets. An evaluation was performed to verify the failure mechanism and to estimate the degree of damage that occurred to the pipe segment. Failure analysis of a section of the jacket confirmed that pitting corrosion on the exterior of the pipe led to the through-wall penetration. Ultrasonic measurements on sections of the pipe were utilized to determine the remaining wall thickness in adjacent areas of the pipe. Based on these measurements, the degree of pitting and general corrosion was determined. Pit growth rate models were then developed to estimate the life expectancy of sections of the pipe that had not been excavated. The calculations estimated that the occurrence of through-wall failures in this jacket will begin to increase substantially in 12 years. Given that this pipe segment will be utilized beyond this time, short-term and long-term solutions to this failure were proposed. The short-term solutions focused on the repair or replace decisions that must be made to return the jacket to service as soon as practical. The long-term solutions focused on a broader strategy to address jacket integrity issues in the entire tank farm facility. These solutions included the evaluation of innovative remote inspection and repair techniques...|$|R
