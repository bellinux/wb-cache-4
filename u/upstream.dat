5|$|Crossings of the Kootenay River {{are listed}} from <b>upstream</b> to downstream. The {{name of the}} road/track, the coordinates, and the {{location}} are given.|$|E
5|$|Downstream is the 10th Avenue Bridge, {{once known}} as the Cedar Avenue Bridge. Immediately <b>upstream</b> is the lock and dam at Saint Anthony Falls, where Minneapolis began. The first bridge <b>upstream</b> is the {{historic}} Stone Arch Bridge, built for the Great Northern Railway and now used for bicycle and pedestrian traffic.|$|E
5|$|Each {{software}} package has a maintainer {{that may be}} either one person or a team of Debian developers and non-developer maintainers. The maintainer keeps track of <b>upstream</b> releases, and ensures that the package coheres {{with the rest of}} the distribution and meets the standards of quality of Debian. Packages may include modifications introduced by Debian to achieve compliance with Debian Policy, even to fix non-Debian specific bugs, although coordination with <b>upstream</b> developers is advised.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, the Hull Bridge <b>upstream</b> of Beverley, {{which had}} caused so much {{disagreement}} in the 18th century {{until it had}} been replaced in 1801, was demolished by the County Council, who installed a steel rolling bridge in its place. Once the Tickton Bypass bridge had been built a short distance <b>upstream,</b> it no longer needed to carry road traffic, and it {{was replaced by a}} footbridge in 1976.|$|E
5|$|In 1930 {{the capital}} of Equatoria (southern Sudan) was {{transferred}} from Mongalla to Juba, further <b>upstream</b> to the south.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the {{concentration}} of sulfates at several points on Kettle Creek was measured. <b>Upstream</b> of Slide Hollow, it was seven milligrams per liter and in Slide Hollow, it was 910 milligrams per liter. The sulfate concentration of Kettle Creek <b>upstream</b> of Short Bend Run was 8 milligrams per liter. In Short Bend Run it was 431 milligrams per liter. Above Twomile Run on Kettle Creek, the sulfate concentration was 16 milligrams per liter and at the mouth it was 11 milligrams per liter. <b>Upstream</b> of the acid mine drainage, the sulfate concentration ranges from under 10 to 17 parts per million. In areas affected by acid mine drainage, the sulfate concentration ranges from 37 to 1375 parts per million.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, Eddy Creek lacked culm {{deposits}} at its mouth. However, its water was colored yellow by sulfur at that location. Further <b>upstream,</b> two pipes discharged mine {{water into the}} creek. One of these pipes had reddish water. However, <b>upstream</b> of an ash dump on the creek, the water was clear.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{watershed}} of Little Fishing Creek <b>upstream</b> {{of the stream}} gauge on it is forest. There is also agricultural land, especially in the northwestern and southern parts of {{the watershed}} and small areas of developed land in the watershed's southern section. 64.5 {{percent of the land}} in the watershed <b>upstream</b> of Eyers Grove is forested land and 34.7 percent is agricultural land. 0.7 percent of the land is developed and the remaining 0.2 percent has other uses.|$|E
5|$|The Sudd, a vast area of swampland, {{stretches}} downriver from Mongalla to {{near the}} point where the Sobat River joins the White Nile just <b>upstream</b> from Malakal.|$|E
5|$|The type-B plug has a near square {{cross-section}} {{with the}} top exterior corners beveled. As part of a removable cable, it inserts into an <b>upstream</b> port on a device, such as a printer. On some devices, the type-B receptacle has no data connections, being used solely for accepting power from the <b>upstream</b> device. This two-connector-type scheme (A/B) prevents a user from accidentally creating a loop.|$|E
5|$|There is an {{herbaceous}} wetland along Abrahams Creek just <b>upstream</b> {{of where}} it enters Frances Slocum Lake. Further to the north, there is a flooded forested wetland. The creek has a substantial riparian buffer <b>upstream</b> of Frances Slocum Lake. The plant species Carex disperma inhabits the area. Bird species such as Virginia rail and Sora inhabit the area as well.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} {{of major}} {{crossings}} of San Juan Creek, proceeding <b>upstream</b> of the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Above {{the swamp}} on Twomile Run, the {{discharge}} of the stream is 511 gallons per minute. <b>Upstream</b> of Middle Branch Twomile Run, the discharge is 618 gallons per minute and downstream of Robbins Hollow, the discharge is 1402 gallons per minute. Downstream of the sampling site KC121, the discharge is 1893 gallons per minute and <b>upstream</b> of Huling Branch, the discharge is 2258 gallons per minute. The discharge {{at the mouth of}} Twomile Run ranges from 200 to 10,000 gallons per minute, which is between 0.6 and 2 percent of {{the discharge of}} Kettle Creek.|$|E
5|$|Boreal {{forest trees}} such as black spruce, paper birch, and {{tamarack}} inhabit wetlands in the watershed of Roaring Brook. Plants such as mountain laurel, leather leaf, pitcher plant, rhododendron, huckleberry, and lady's slipper inhabit bogs in these wetlands. Old-growth forests containing oak, pine, and hemlock trees are {{also present in}} the Nay Aug Gorge. <b>Upstream</b> of Ridge Row, the stream's riparian buffer is wooded with some rock outcrops. <b>Upstream</b> of Nay Aug, the riparian canopy is mostly intact. Some hemlock trees in the Nay Aug Gorge {{have been affected by}} hemlock wooly adelgid.|$|E
5|$|Dams {{interrupt}} {{the migration of}} anadromous fish. Salmon and steelhead return to the streams {{in which they were}} born to spawn; where dams prevent their return, entire populations of salmon die. Some of the Columbia and Snake River dams employ fish ladders, which are effective to varying degrees at allowing these fish to travel <b>upstream.</b> Another problem exists for the juvenile salmon headed downstream to the ocean. Previously, this journey would have taken two to three weeks. With river currents slowed by the dams, and the Columbia converted from wild river to a series of slackwater pools, the journey can take several months, which increases the mortality rate. In some cases, the Army Corps of Engineers transports juvenile fish downstream by truck or river barge. The Chief Joseph Dam and several dams on the Columbia's tributaries entirely block migration, and there are no migrating fish on the river above these dams. Sturgeon have different migration habits and can survive without ever visiting the ocean. In many <b>upstream</b> areas cut off from the ocean by dams, sturgeon simply live <b>upstream</b> of the dam.|$|E
5|$|Hull Creek is a second-order stream. Its {{watershed}} {{is relatively}} narrow. In {{the upper reaches}} of the creek's watershed, residential areas are sparse and tend to be somewhat removed from the creek itself. In Blakely, it follows Pennsylvania Route 347 closely and crosses it several times. A gas line crosses the creek <b>upstream</b> of US Route 6. There are several patches of wetlands in the watershed's upper reaches, and two more in the middle and lower reaches. <b>Upstream</b> of Blakely, the watershed contains forested land and pastures on a rolling plateau.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, the Benton Water Supply Company {{constructed}} a dam on West Creek <b>upstream</b> of Benton. A ten-acre private campground called the West Creek Gap Campgrounds was {{established at the}} headwaters of West Creek in 1979 by the wife of George Mikulski.|$|E
5|$|In 1998 Salon {{reported}} that Scientologists were now blocked from viewing sites critical of Scientology including Operation Clambake and alt.religion.scientology, {{through the use}} of a content-control software program referred to by critics as Scieno Sitter. The Church of Scientology was unable to shut down Operation Clambake's internet service provider in Norway. The organization succeeded in shutting down the <b>upstream</b> connection to the site's internet service provider, Netherlands-based Xtended Internet. In November 2002, Xtended Internet's <b>upstream</b> provider, Cignal Global Communications received a letter from Church of Scientology counsel alleging copyright and trademark infringement involved with Xenu.net. This letter led to Cignal Global Communications, a United States-based company, terminating its service with Xtended Internet, which had to move their company to a new backbone provider.|$|E
5|$|In July 2005 a water {{taxi service}} was {{launched}} in Spalding. Its route is from just off Spalding's High Street <b>upstream</b> along the river, turning onto the Coronation Channel, and going to Springfields Outlet Shopping & Festival Gardens, and back.|$|E
5|$|Keyser Creek has {{unstable}} banks due to {{abandoned mine}} impacts. Its banks are shallow and natural cobblestone banks in its lower reaches. However, the creek is channeled {{and has a}} steep bank further <b>upstream.</b>|$|E
5|$|Large {{numbers of}} swans and geese use the river around Crowland, {{and out to}} sea. Smaller populations of each can be seen around the Stamford Meadows, and further <b>upstream.</b>|$|E
5|$|NY18E {{was a short}} spur {{assigned}} in {{the early}} 1930s to a connector between then-NY18 (now NY18F) and the original QueenstonLewiston Bridge in Lewiston. It was removed in the early 1960s when the original bridge to Queenston was replaced with the modern LewistonQueenston Bridge a short distance <b>upstream.</b>|$|E
5|$|Southcote saw {{development}} {{with the opening}} of the Kennet Navigation in the 1720s, where the River Kennet was made navigable by vessels as far <b>upstream</b> as Newbury; industrialisation along the canal continued for the next century.|$|E
5|$|Spring Creek is {{the only}} named {{tributary}} of White Deer Hole Creek. Five unnamed tributaries flow through named features of South White Deer Ridge. Going <b>upstream</b> in order they are: Beartrap Hollow, First Gap, Second Gap, Third Gap, and Fourth Gap.|$|E
5|$|The Cleveland Bridge and Engineering Company of Darlington was {{appointed}} {{to carry out the}} rebuilding. In 1937 each stone on the <b>upstream</b> side was removed and numbered and the bridge widened; the stone facing of the <b>upstream</b> side was then reassembled and the bridge reopened to traffic in 1940. Throughout the redevelopment, a single lane of traffic was kept open at all times. It was found that the 18th-century foundations, consisting of wooden platforms sunk into the river bed, had largely rotted away, and they were reinforced with steel pilings and concrete foundations. During the widening works the opportunity was also taken to lower slightly the roadbed at the centre of the bridge and raise the access ramps, reducing the humpbacked nature of the bridge's central section.|$|E
5|$|The Severn bore is a {{tidal bore}} {{seen on the}} tidal reaches of the River Severn in south western England. It is formed when the rising tide moves into the funnel-shaped Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary and the surging water forces its way <b>upstream</b> {{in a series of}} waves, as far as Gloucester and beyond. The bore behaves {{differently}} in different stretches of the river; in the lower, wider parts it is more noticeable in the deep channels as a slight roller, while the water creeps across the sand and mudflats. In the narrower, upper reaches, the river occupies the whole area between its banks and the bore advances in a series of waves that move <b>upstream.</b> Near Gloucester, the advancing water overcomes two weirs, and sometimes one in Tewkesbury, before finally petering out.|$|E
5|$|The Yellala Falls (Rapides de Yelala or Chutes Yelala; also spelled as Ielala) are {{a series}} of waterfalls and rapids on the Congo River just <b>upstream</b> from Matadi in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.|$|E
5|$|The Yellala Falls and {{the other}} falls and rapids <b>upstream</b> have largely {{isolated}} the aquatic fauna of the Congo Basin for around five million years, a significant period on an evolutionary timescale.|$|E
5|$|The creek is {{designated}} as Approved Trout Waters from a powerline crossing <b>upstream</b> of Nuangola Road downstream to county road. In 2016, it opened for trout fishing on April 16.|$|E
5|$|The first temperature-sensitive RNA element was {{reported}} in 1989. Prior to this research, mutations <b>upstream</b> from the transcription start site in a lambda (λ) phage cIII mRNA were found to affect the level of translation of the cIII protein. This protein is involved in selection of either a lytic or lysogenic life cycle in λ phage, with high concentrations of cIII promoting lysogeny. Further study of this <b>upstream</b> RNA region identified two alternative secondary structures; experimental study found the structures to be interchangeable, and dependent on both magnesium ion concentration and temperature. This RNA thermometer is now thought to encourage entry to a lytic cycle under heat stress {{in order for the}} bacteriophage to rapidly replicate and escape the host cell.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle and}} upper reaches of Tangascootack Creek are nearly devoid of life due to acid mine drainage. However, the {{headwaters}} have some aquatic life, as they are further <b>upstream.</b> Brook trout and three other species of fish inhabit the creek. 13 species of benthic macroinvertebrate also inhabit it.|$|E
5|$|The {{modified}} Hilsenhoff Biotic Index {{value of}} Spring Brook {{a short distance}} <b>upstream</b> of the Watres Reservoir is 2.56. The modified EPT Index value at this location is 15. The taxa richness value is 26.|$|E
5|$|The new Jerash Bridge {{crosses the}} Zarqa <b>upstream</b> of King Talal reservoir, {{on the road}} from Amman to Jerash. The bridge {{is the site of}} a gauging station where flow {{measurements}} are continuously taken.|$|E
5|$|The parade, {{including}} the Governor's carriage, then proceeded {{over the new}} Causeway after Maley. The Governor's procession continued on steam boats <b>upstream</b> to Guildford where the Governor opened the new Guildford and Helena Bridges.|$|E
