40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} problem of efficient, {{scalable}} set-sharing analysis of logic programs. We use the idea of representing sharing information {{as a pair of}} abstract substitutions, one of which is a worst-case sharing representation called a clique set, which was previously proposed for the case of inferring pair-sharing. We use the clique-set representation for (1) inferring actual set-sharing information, and (2) analysis within a topdown framework. In particular, we define the abstract functions required by standard top-down analyses, both for sharing alone and also for the case of including freeness in addition to sharing. Our experimental evaluation supports the conclusion that, for inferring set-sharing, as it was the case for inferring pair-sharing, precision losses are limited, while <b>useful</b> <b>efficiency</b> gains are obtained. At the limit, the clique-set representation allowed analyzing some programs that exceeded memory capacity using classical sharing representations. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contains}} a description and detailed computational {{analysis of a}} vortex cleaning system designed to remove radioactive material from the plumes of nuclear rockets. The proposed system is designed to remove both particulates and radioactive gaseous material from the plume. A two part computational model is {{used to examine the}} system's ability to remove particulates, and the results indicate that under some conditions, the system can remove over 99 % of the particles in the flow. However, the effectiveness of the system depends heavily on the size and density of the particles the flow. This paper identifies two critical parameters which govern the effectiveness of the system and provides the information necessary to estimate cleaning efficiencies for particles of known sizes and densities. A simple steady state analytical solution is also developed to examine the system's ability to remove gaseous radioactive material. This analysis, while inconclusive, suggests that the swirl rates necessary to achieve <b>useful</b> <b>efficiencies</b> are too high to be achieved in any practical manner.

40|$|We {{describe}} a simple method for joining the 5 '-protruding, single-stranded DNA ends generated by restriction enzymes. The method allows ends with different sequences {{to be joined}} and prevents identical ends from being joined. This is accomplished by partially filling the single strands in a controlled reverse transcriptase reaction. Partial filling can create new single-stranded ends that can be ligated to different, partially filled ends. In almost all useful cases, partial filling simultaneously eliminates the self-complementarity of identical ends and thus prevents them from being joined by DNA ligase. Although all possible combinations of partially filled ends were not tested, the tests performed indicate that the method is fairly general. We demonstrate that ends of the same length can be ligated with <b>useful</b> <b>efficiency</b> if they are: 1) one nucleotide long and complementary; 2) two nucleotides long and complementary or have a mismatch (dA:dC) at one position; or 3) three nucleotides long and, in our test, have a dT:dC mismatch at the middle position...|$|E

40|$|Decomposition {{analysis}} {{can provide a}} <b>useful</b> <b>efficiency</b> metric for the industrial sector, it does so by separating the influence of changes in energy intensity from structural and activity changes. The activity refactorisation (AR) approach to decomposition analysis offers a potentially improved methodology, with a better correlation to real efficiency improvements. This is achieved through combining monetary and physical output data. Here the AR approach is compared to other methodologies for the United Kingdom industrial sector over the period 1997 – 2012. Even with limited availability of physical output data the AR approach was found to provide significantly different results to those obtained using only monetary output measures. When monetary output was the sole measure of activity, intensity (efficiency) improvements were overestimated. It is recommended that physical output data is supplied alongside energy demand and monetary output data in national accounts to better track efficiency improvements and allow such improved metrics to feed into decarbonisation policy discussions...|$|E

However, most ap-proaches {{are limited by}} the fact that the desired functionality must be represented as a boolean circuit. In response, random-access machines (RAM programs) have recently been investigated as a promising alternative representation. In this work, we present the first practical protocols for evaluating RAM programs with security against malicious adversaries. A <b>useful</b> <b>efficiency</b> measure is to divide the cost of malicious-secure evalu-ation of f by the cost of semi-honest-secure evaluation of f. Our RAM protocols achieve ratios matching the state of the art for circuit-based 2 PC. For statistical security 2 −s, our protocol without preprocessing achieves a ratio of s; our online-offline protocol has a pre-processing phase and achieves online ratio ∼ 2 s / log T, where T is the total execution time of the RAM program. To summarize, our solutions show that the “extra overhead ” of obtaining malicious security for RAM programs (beyond what is needed for circuits) is minimal and does not grow with the running time of the program. ...|$|E

The present paper considers {{the application of}} TMLAs to acoustic systems and proposes an algorithm for efficiently deriving the arrival angle of a signal. The proposed technique is applied in the frequency domain, where the signal and harmonic content is captured. Using a weighted average method on harmonic amplitudes and their respective main beam angles, {{it is possible to}} determine an estimate for the signal’s direction of arrival. The method is demonstrated and evaluated using results from both numerical and practical implementations and performance data is provided. The use of Micro-Electromechanical Systems (MEMS) sensors allows time-modulation techniques to be applied at ultrasonic frequencies. Theoretical predictions for an array of five isotropic elements with half-wavelength spacing and 1000 data samples suggest an accuracy of ± 1 ∘ within an angular range of approximately ± 50 ∘.

The silicon detectors were located edgewise {{on opposite sides of}} a 4 cm field-of-view to maximize efficiency.

40|$|Provisional chapterFullerene-based organic {{photovoltaic}} devices (OPVs) have attracted increasing interest as a low-cost, lightweight, flexible {{and easy to}} process alternative to the silicon-based solar cells. Currently the most efficient fullerene-based OPV devices, although improving dramatically {{in the last few}} years, are still a long way from a technologically <b>useful</b> <b>efficiency.</b> The performance of current OPV devices is assumed to exist due to the phase separation of the donor (D) and acceptor (A) materials into co-continuous networks of D and A rich phases, forming the so-called Bulk-Hetero-Junctions (BHJ). A typical BHJ active layer in an OPV device is a thin film mixture of a conjugated donor polymer such as regioregular poly(3 -hexyl-thiophene) (P 3 HT), and a functionalized acceptor fullerene such as [6, 6]-phenyl C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). The morphology of these BHJ films has proven to be extremely important in determining the optoelectronic properties of the corresponding devices. However, the correlations between the structure of these donor/acceptor materials from atomic to microscopic length scales, the resulting optoelectronic properties, and the device performance are still not understood from first principles. The understanding and manipulation of this polymer-fullerene morphology has therefore been the focus of intense electronic and optoelectronic polymer-device research, using a broad range of techniques, yet the results from these studies are less than definitive and, in some cases, contradictory. In this chapter, some of these most relevant studies in the understanding and manipulation of the polymer-fullerene morphology are reviewed...|$|E
