40|$|Excessive {{collagen}} degradation (collagenolysis) {{has been}} implicated {{in a series of}} diseases such as tumor metastasis, atherosclerosis and arthritis. There are still several unresolved questions about the mechanism of collagenolysis. First, the prototypical structure of the collagen triple helix does not fit into the active site of collagenases, the enzymes responsible of cleaving collagen. Moreover, the scissile bond that is degraded during collagenolysis is hidden from solvent. Therefore it is widely agreed that collagen unfolding must occur in order for collagenolysis to proceed. Some proposed mechanisms suggest that collagenases actively unfold collagen in order to expose the cleavage site, but no direct evidence of such mechanisms has been provided. Second, while several potential cleavage sites exist in the sequence of collagen, only one is cleaved in triple helical collagen. The hypothesis of this work is that locally <b>unfolded</b> <b>states</b> exist in collagen in the absence of collagenases. They occur {{as a result of the}} natural thermal fluctuations in the structure of collagen. Collagenolysis occurs when collagenases bind and cleave these <b>unfolded</b> <b>states.</b> In this work, a combination of computational and experimental methods is presented in order to test this hypothesis. Initially, computational results suggest that locally <b>unfolded</b> <b>states</b> are ubiquitous along the structure of collagen. However, it is shown that not all <b>unfolded</b> <b>states</b> are created equal, and that the precise sequence in the vicinity of the true collagenase cleavage site in type III collagen allows collagen to sample locally <b>unfolded</b> <b>states</b> that are complimentary to the collagenase active site. Therefore, it is hypothesized that cleavage site specificity is encoded in the nature of the <b>unfolded</b> <b>states.</b> Next, it is shown that types I and III collagen can be bound and cleaved at the actual cleavage site by just the catalytic domain of collagenases, a finding in apparent contradiction with previous work in this field. These results are interpreted in light of a novel conformational selection mechanism in which collagenases only cleave locally <b>unfolded,</b> vulnerable <b>states.</b> Finally, based on the new mechanism of collagenolysis presented here, new strategies to regulate collagenolysis are proposed. by Ramon Salsas Escat.

2500|$|Phi value {{analysis}} is an experimental protein engineering method {{used to study}} {{the structure of the}} folding transition state in small protein domains that fold in a two-state manner. Since the folding transition state is by definition a transient and partially unstructured state, its structure is difficult to determine by traditional methods such as protein NMR or X-ray crystallography. [...] In phi-value analysis, the folding kinetics and conformational folding stability of the wild-type protein are compared with those of one or more point mutants. [...] This comparison yields a phi value (defined below) that seeks to measure the mutated residue's energetic contribution to the folding transition state (and thus the degree of native structure around the mutated residue in the transition state) from the relative free energies of the <b>unfolded</b> <b>state,</b> the folded state and the transition state for the wild-type and mutant proteins.|$|E
2500|$|Helices {{observed}} in proteins {{can range from}} four to over forty residues long, but a typical helix contains about ten amino acids (about three turns). In general, short polypeptides do not exhibit much α-helical structure in solution, since the entropic cost associated with the folding of the polypeptide chain is not compensated for by a sufficient amount of stabilizing interactions. In general, the backbone hydrogen bonds of α-helices are considered slightly weaker than those found in β-sheets, and are readily attacked by the ambient water molecules. However, in more hydrophobic environments such as the plasma membrane, or {{in the presence of}} co-solvents such as trifluoroethanol (TFE), or isolated from solvent in the gas phase, oligopeptides readily adopt stable α-helical structure. [...] Furthermore, crosslinks can be incorporated into peptides to conformationally stabilize helical folds. [...] Crosslinks stabilize the helical state by entropically destabilizing the <b>unfolded</b> <b>state</b> and by removing enthalpically stabilized [...] "decoy" [...] folds that compete with the fully helical state. It has been shown that α-helices are more stable, robust to mutations and designable than β-strands in natural proteins, and also in artificial designed proteins.|$|E
40|$|The <b>unfolded</b> <b>states</b> {{of three}} {{homologous}} proteins {{with a very}} similar fold have been investigated by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. Secondary structure propensities as derived from interpretation of chemical shifts and motional restrictions as evidenced by heteronuclear (15) N relaxation rates have been analyzed in the reduced <b>unfolded</b> <b>states</b> of hen lysozyme and the calcium-binding proteins bovine alpha-lactalbumin and human alpha-lactalbumin. For all three proteins, significant deviations from random-coil predictions can be identified; in addition, the <b>unfolded</b> <b>states</b> also differ from each other, {{despite the fact that}} they possess very similar structures in their native states. Deviations from random-coil motional properties are observed in the alpha- and the beta-domain in bovine alpha-lactalbumin and lysozyme, while only regions within the alpha-domain deviate in human alpha-lactalbumin. The motional restrictions and residual secondary structure are determined both by the amino acid sequence of the protein and by residual long-range interactions. Even a conservative single point mutation from I to L in a highly conserved region between the two alpha-lactalbumins results in considerable differences in the motional properties. Given the differences in oxidative folding between hen lysozyme and alpha-lactalbumin, the results obtained on the <b>unfolded</b> <b>states</b> suggest that residual long-range interactions, i. e., those between the alpha- and the beta-domain of lysozyme, may act as nucleation sites for protein folding, while this property of residual structure is replaced by the calcium-binding site between the domains in alpha-lactalbumin...|$|R

40|$|Protecting osmolytes are {{widespread}} small {{organic molecules}} able {{to stabilize the}} folded state of most proteins against various denaturing stresses in vivo. The osmophobic model explains thermodynamically their action through a preferential exclusion of the osmolyte molecules from the protein surface, thus favoring the formation of intrapeptide hydrogen bonds. Few works addressed the influence of protecting osmolytes on the protein <b>unfolding</b> transition <b>state</b> and kinetics. Among those, previous single molecule force spectroscopy experiments evidenced a complexation of the protecting osmolyte molecules at the <b>unfolding</b> transition <b>state</b> of the protein, in apparent contradiction with the osmophobic nature of the protein backbone.

40|$|Protein misfolding and {{aggregation}} are interconnected processes {{involved in}} a wide variety of nonneuropathic, systemic, and neurodegenerative diseases. More generally, if mutations in sequence or changes in environmental conditions lead to partial unfolding of the native state of a protein, it will often aggregate, sometimes into well-defined fibrillar structures. A great deal of interest has been directed at discovering the characteristic features of metastable partially <b>unfolded</b> <b>states</b> that precede the aggregated states of proteins. In this work, human muscle acylphosphatase (AcP) has been first destabilized, by addition of urea or by means of elevated temperatures, and then incubated in the presence of different concentrations of 2, 2, 2, trifluoroethanol ranging from 5 % to 25 % (v/v). The results show that AcP is able to form both fibrillar and nonfibrillar aggregates with a high β-sheet content from partially <b>unfolded</b> <b>states</b> with very different structural features. Moreover, the presence of α-helical structure in such a state does not appear to be a fundamental determinant of the ability to aggregate. The lack of ready aggregation under some of the conditions examined here is attributable primarily to the intrinsic properties of the solutions rather than to specific structural features of the partially <b>unfolded</b> <b>states</b> that precede aggregation. Aggregation appears to be favored when the solution conditions promote stable intermolecular interactions, particularly hydrogen bonds. In addition, the structures of the resulting aggregates are largely independent of the conformational properties of their soluble precursors...|$|R
