50|$|Normalization is an {{annealing}} process applied to ferrous alloys {{to give the}} material a <b>uniform</b> <b>fine-grained</b> <b>structure</b> and make it less brittle. It involves heating the steel to 20-50°C above its upper critical point, soaking it {{for a short period}} at that temperature and then allowing it to cool in air. Heating the steel just above its upper critical point creates austenitic grains (much smaller than the previous ferritic grains), which during cooling, form new ferritic grains with a further refined grain size. The process produces a tougher, more ductile material, and eliminates columnar grains and dendritic segregation that sometimes occurs during casting. Normalizing improves machinability of a component and provides dimensional stability if subjected to further heat treatment processes.|$|E
40|$|We {{report that}} high {{transport}} critical current density exceeding 104 A/cm 2 at 4. 2 K and 10 T {{can be obtained}} with good reproducibility for Ag sheathed (Ba,K) Fe 2 As 2 (Ba 122) tapes by modifying the ex-situ powder-in-tube (PIT) method. The process involves cycles of the cold deformation and subsequent heat treatment. The intermediate cycles of flat rolling and heat treatment produce <b>uniform</b> <b>fine-grained</b> <b>structure,</b> resulting in an enhancement of transport Jc in applied magnetic fields. However, the rolled tapes contain cracks running traverse to the tape axis, which still limit the current pass along the tape axis. We found that the application of uniaxial pressing with small reduction rate at the final stage is very effective to heal those cracks, resulting in an extraordinary increase of the transport Jc. We achieved the highest Jc (at 4. 2 K and 10 T) of 2. 1 x 104 A/cm 2 among the PIT processed Fe based wires and tapes reported so far. The Jc-H curves measured at higher temperatures maintains a small filed dependence up to around 20 K, suggesting that the tapes are promising for applications at higher temperatures {{as well as in}} liquid helium...|$|E

Patenting involves two-stage heat treatment that includes heating the wire up to the temperature above Ac 3 in a continuous heating furnace (in the temperature range of 850 ÷ 1050 °C) followed by a rapid cooling in a tank with a lead bath down to the temperature range of 450 ÷ 550 °C. The patenting process is most significantly influenced by the chemistry of the steel being treated, {{as well as by the}} temperature and the rate of heating and cooling of the wire rod or wire being patented...|$|R

40|$|Titanium alloy (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V) with a bimodal {{harmonic}} structure, {{which is}} defined as a coarse-grained structure surrounded by a network structure of fine grains, was fabricated using powder metallurgy to improve both the strength and ductility. The microstructure of the sintered compacts was characterized using electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD). The areal fraction of the <b>fine-grained</b> <b>structure</b> in the harmonic structure tended to increase with the milling time. Tensile tests and four-point bending fatigue tests at a stress ratio of 0. 1 were performed in air at room temperature. The tensile strength, 0. 2 % proof stress and fatigue limit of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy with harmonic structure tended to increase as the areal fraction of the <b>fine-grained</b> <b>structure</b> increased. In contrast, elongation decreased due to the formation of a high areal fraction of the <b>fine-grained</b> <b>structure</b> (79. 0 %), which resulted in a reduction of the fatigue life with a low cycle regime. Thus, titanium alloy with high strength, ductility and fatigue resistance can be formed by optimization of the milling conditions. Furthermore, the mechanism for fatigue fracture of the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy with a harmonic structure is discussed with respect to fractography and crystallography. A fatigue crack was initiated from the α-facet of the coarse-grained structure in the harmonic structure...|$|R

We present two new corpora of email and blog conversations annotated with topics, and evaluate annotator reliability for the segmentation and labeling tasks in these asynchronous conversations. We propose a complete computational framework for topic segmentation and labeling in asynchronous conversations. Our approach extends state-of-the-art methods by considering a <b>fine-grained</b> <b>structure</b> of an asynchronous conversation, along with other conversational features by applying recent graph-based methods for NLP. For topic segmentation, we propose two novel unsupervised models that exploit the <b>fine-grained</b> conversational <b>structure,</b> and a novel graph-theoretic supervised model that combines lexical, conversational and topic features. For topic labeling, we propose two novel (unsupervised) random walk models that respectively capture conversation specific clues from two different sources: the leading sentences and the <b>fine-grained</b> conversational <b>structure.</b> Empirical evaluation shows that the segmentation and the labeling performed by our best models beat the state-of-the-art, and are highly correlated with human annotations. 1...|$|R
