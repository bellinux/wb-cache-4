5|$|It {{was some}} time {{afterward}} when the thought flashed <b>upon</b> <b>my</b> {{mind that the}} disturbances I had observed {{might be due to}} an intelligent control. Although I could not decipher their meaning, it was impossible for me to think of them as having been entirely accidental. The feeling is constantly growing on me that I had been the first to hear the greeting of one planet to another.|$|E

25|$|Suddenly the {{character}} of a Savior was vividly impressed <b>upon</b> <b>my</b> mind. It seemed {{that there might be a}} Being so good and compassionate as to Himself atone for our transgressions, and thereby save us from suffering the penalty of sin. I immediately felt how lovely such a Being must be; and imagined that I could cast myself into the arms of, and trust in the mercy of, such a One.|$|E
25|$|Of those 25 years, I {{spent nine}} as {{prisoner}} of war. Those days were grim, and survival was a struggle. I {{was able to}} withstand that long agony because I never lost my determination to live—no matter how painful that became—because I love my country and never lost faith in her, and because I had dreams of what {{my life would be}} like <b>upon</b> <b>my</b> return to America. Those dreams were always, unquestionably, of a life that was Army. I found that the dream of continued service gave me a goal that helped me survive my years as a POW.|$|E
25|$|Seeing {{that there}} are many reasons for expounding the Madhyamakalankara, Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, our {{incomparable}} guide, unbounded in his kindness, whose very name I hardly dare to pronounce, who is the very personification of the compassion of the abbot Bodhisattva, of the master Padmasambhava, and of King Trisongdetsen, who is the sovereign among the learned and accomplished, who is supreme Manjushri appearing {{in the form of a}} monk in saffron robes, and whose renown fills the world, gave to me the Indian and Tibetan commentaries on the Madhyamakalankara, asking me to study them well and to compose a commentary. And as his diamondlike injunction came down <b>upon</b> <b>my</b> head, I earnestly gave myself to the task.|$|E
50|$|The AON Centre was {{influenced}} by the classical formalism of Mies van der Rohe and Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, in particular Yuncken Freeman drew <b>upon</b> <b>Mies</b> Van Der Rohe’s Federal Center in Chicago (1964) in a more formalised manner the Seagram Building, New York (1958) was also used as inspiration. The Seagram Building was used as a precedent when it comes to creating open space that is used by the public as they enter the building.|$|R

25|$|I {{have been}} a Catholic and an infidel; I {{have been a}} Roman priest and a hypocrite; I have been a profligate under a cowl. I am that Father Achilli, who as early as 1826, was {{deprived}} of my faculty to lecture, for an offence which my superiors {{did their best to}} conceal; and who in 1827 had already earned the reputation of a scandalous friar. I am that Achilli, who in the diocese of Viterbo in February, 1831, robbed of her honour a young women of eighteen; who in September 1833, was found guilty of a second such crime, {{in the case of a}} person of twenty-eight; and who perpetrated a third in July, 1834, in the case of another aged twenty-four. I am he, who afterwards was found guilty of sins, similar or worse, in other towns of the neighbourhood. I am that son of St. Dominic who is known to have repeated the offence at Capua, in 1834 or 1835; and at Naples again, in 1840, in the case of a child of fiteen. I am he who chose the sacristy of the church for one of these crimes, and Good Friday for another. Look on me, ye mothers of England, a confessor against Popery, for ye 'ne'er may look <b>upon</b> <b>my</b> like again.' I am that veritable priest, who, after all this, began to speak against, not only the Catholic faith, but the moral law, and perverted others by my teaching. I am the Cavaliere Achilli, who then went to Corfu, made the wife of a tailor faithless to her husband, and lived publicly and travelled about with the wife of a chorus-singer. I am that Professor of the Protestant College at Malta, who with two others was dismissed from my post for offences which the authorities cannot get themselves to describe. And now attend to me, such as I am, and you shall see what you shall see about the barbarity and profligacy of the Inquisitors of Rome.|$|E

500|$|With rare praise, Johnson said of Pennant [...] "... he's {{the best}} {{traveller}} I ever read; he observes more things {{than anyone else}} does." [...] And in 1777, Johnson said to Boswell [...] "Our ramble in the islands hangs <b>upon</b> <b>my</b> imagination. I can hardly help imagining that we shall go again. Pennant seems to have seen a great deal which we did not see. When we travel again let us look better about us." ...|$|E

500|$|The devastating loss {{crippled}} Early's cavalry in the Shenandoah Valley. It became {{half the}} size it was, and had two of its better brigades decimated. The loss also demoralized the remaining members of Early's cavalry. Early later wrote that the battle had [...] "a very damaging effect <b>upon</b> <b>my</b> cavalry {{for the rest of}} the campaign." [...] The victory also marked the beginning of the [...] "permanent ascendancy of the Union cavalry in the Shenandoah Valley".|$|E
500|$|In the House of Lords, {{technically}} {{called the}} Court of the King (or Queen) in Parliament, the Lord High Steward was the President or Chairman of the Court, {{and the entire}} House determined both questions of fact and questions of law {{as well as the}} verdict. By convention, Bishops and Archbishops did not vote on the verdict, though they were expected to attend {{during the course of the}} trial. They sat until the conclusion of the deliberations, and withdrew from the chamber just prior to the final vote. At the end of the trial, peers voted on the question before them by standing and declaring their verdict by saying [...] "guilty, <b>upon</b> <b>my</b> honour" [...] or [...] "not guilty, <b>upon</b> <b>my</b> honour", starting with the most junior baron and proceeding in order of precedence ending with the Lord High Steward. For a guilty verdict, a majority of twelve was necessary. The entire House also determined the punishment to be imposed, which had to accord with the law. For capital crimes the punishment was death; the last peer to be executed was Laurence Shirley, 4th Earl Ferrers, who was hanged for murder in 1760.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1847 Josephine visited her brother in County Laois, Ireland. It was {{at the height of}} the Great Famine and the first time she had come into contact with {{widespread}} suffering among the poor; she was deeply affected by her experiences and later recalled that [...] "As a young girl, I had no conception of the full meaning of the misery I saw around me, yet it printed itself <b>upon</b> <b>my</b> brain and memory." ...|$|E

500|$|Edgar Allan Poe {{may have}} evoked The Nightmare in his short story [...] "The Fall of the House of Usher" [...] (1839). His narrator compares a {{painting}} hanging in Usher's house to a Fuseli work, and reveals that an [...] "irrepressible tremor gradually pervaded my frame; and, at length, there sat <b>upon</b> <b>my</b> heart an incubus of utterly causeless alarm". Poe and Fuseli shared {{an interest in}} the subconscious; Fuseli is often quoted as saying, [...] "One of the most unexplored regions of art are dreams".|$|E
500|$|In 1950, the FBI {{opened a}} file on Little after {{he wrote a}} letter from prison to President Truman expressing {{opposition}} to the Korean War and declaring himself a Communist. That year, Little also began signing his name [...] "MalcolmX". He explained in his autobiography that the Muslim's [...] "X" [...] symbolized the true African family name that he could never know. [...] "For me, my 'X' replaced the white slavemaster name of 'Little' which some blue-eyed devil named Little had imposed <b>upon</b> <b>my</b> paternal forebears." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{themes of}} the lyrics include contrast, contradictions and urgency. According to Jon Wiederhon of MTV News, [...] "Martin seems to address the {{helplessness}} {{of being in a}} dysfunctional relationship he doesn't necessarily want to escape." [...] The lyrics are cryptic; the ending lines of the second verse emphasize contradicting emotion: [...] "Come out <b>upon</b> <b>my</b> seas/Cursed missed opportunities/Am I a part of the cure/Or am I part of the disease?" [...] The song's title also [...] "metaphorically alludes" [...] to its lyrics, [...] "pushing one to wonder about the world's obsession with time while connecting it to the theory: {{make the best of it}} when we’re here, present and alive." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{the major}} {{disappointment}} {{of losing the}} role in The Good Earth, Wong announced plans for a year-long tour of China, to visit her father and his family in Taishan. Wong's father had returned to his hometown in China with her younger brothers and sister in 1934. [...] Aside from Mei Lanfang's offer to teach her, she wanted {{to learn more about}} the Chinese theater and through English translations to better perform some Chinese plays before international audiences. She told the San Francisco Chronicle on her departure, [...] "...for a year, I shall study the land of my fathers. Perhaps <b>upon</b> <b>my</b> arrival, I shall feel like an outsider. Perhaps instead, I shall find my past life assuming a dreamlike quality of unreality." ...|$|E
500|$|All of his work, {{which has}} been called [...] "striking", shares a {{distinct}} visual style inspired by Golden Age comic artists, Russian Constructivists, Italian Futurists, and woodcut artists. In an interview with Sherwin, Hughes stated, [...] "KMFDM have cornered the market in industrial post-modern angst and so my work reflects that." [...] Hughes said that initially he based {{his work on the}} music, which caused [...] "artistic block". Konietzko gave him more freedom to use whatever themes he wished, resulting in the cover to Money, which Hughes said [...] "was based <b>upon</b> <b>my</b> disillusionment with the street lifestyle I was experiencing at the time, and the art carries with it the implication that no matter what temptation lies in your path, you still gotta pay!" ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of her self-titled debut album, Carey desired to pen her {{personal}} struggles prior to her signing with Columbia. She hoped to give her fans {{an idea of what}} her life two years prior and to instill relief or inspiration in them. In the song, Carey sings [...] "Not more than three short years ago / I was abandoned and alone / Without a penny to my name / So very young and so afraid / No proper shoes <b>upon</b> <b>my</b> feet / Sometimes I couldn't even eat / I often cried myself to sleep." [...] Later in the song, Carey sings [...] "But still I had to keep on going / I struggled and I prayed / And finally found my way," [...] retelling how her faith helped guide her until her career blossomed and expressing to listeners the importance of finding and connecting with God. Author Chris Nickson wrote the following regarding the song, its lyrics and composition: ...|$|E
