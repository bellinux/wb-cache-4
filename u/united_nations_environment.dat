5|$|Renewable energy {{targets in}} most {{countries}} are indicative and nonbinding but they have assisted government actions and regulatory frameworks. The <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> <b>Environment</b> Program has suggested that making renewable energy targets legally binding could be an important policy tool to achieve higher renewable energy market penetration.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} events in 2006 pushed {{renewable}} energy up the political agenda, including the US mid-term elections in November, which confirmed clean energy as a mainstream issue. Also in 2006, the Stern Review made a strong economic case for investing in low carbon technologies now, and argued that economic growth need not be incompatible with cutting energy consumption. According to a trend analysis from the <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> <b>Environment</b> Programme, climate change concerns coupled with recent high oil prices and increasing government support are driving increasing rates of investment in the renewable energy and energy efficiency industries.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{more than}} three centuries of {{occasional}} human impact on Caroline, it {{is considered to be}} one of very few remaining near-pristine tropical islands, and has been rated {{as one of the most}} unspoiled Pacific atolls. Its relatively undisturbed state has led to Caroline being considered for designation as a World Heritage Site and as a Biosphere Reserve. Ecological surveys documenting the island's flora and fauna have been made intermittently through the later 20th century: Caroline was visited in 1965 by the Pacific Ocean Biological Survey Program, in 1974 by the Line Island Expedition, and in 1988 and 1991 by the <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> <b>Environment</b> Programme Wildlife Conservation Unit.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, the International Resource Panel, {{hosted by}} the <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> <b>Environment</b> Programme (UNEP), {{published}} the first global scientific assessment on the impacts of consumption and production and identified priority actions for developed and developing countries. The {{study found that the}} most critical impacts are related to ecosystem health, human health and resource depletion. From a production perspective, it found that fossil-fuel combustion processes, agriculture and fisheries have the most important impacts. Meanwhile, from a final consumption perspective, it found that household consumption related to mobility, shelter, food and energy-using products cause the majority of life-cycle impacts of consumption.|$|E
5|$|The {{response}} from non-governmental organizations {{has been more}} favorable. The Mekong Wetlands Biodiversity Programme (MWBP), an international alliance managed by the United Nations Development Programme and World Conservation Union, has published {{a study on the}} methodology of Thai Baan research and coordinated their own study in Sri Songkham district in 2004, concluding that it was more useful than top-down styles of village research. The study overseen by the MWBP was cited in an academic journal and submitted to an international conference. Living River Siam's spokesperson Pianporn Deetes was invited to a <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> <b>Environment</b> Programme conference on dams.|$|E
5|$|In {{economic}} and environmental fields, the term decoupling is becoming increasingly used {{in the context of}} economic production and environmental quality. When used in this way, it refers to the ability of an economy to grow without incurring corresponding increases in environmental pressure. Ecological economics includes the study of societal metabolism, the throughput of resources that enter and exit the economic system in relation to environmental quality. An economy that is able to sustain GDP growth without having a negative impact on the environment is said to be decoupled. Exactly how, if, or to what extent this can be achieved is a subject of much debate. In 2011 the International Resource Panel, hosted by the <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> <b>Environment</b> Programme (UNEP), warned that by 2050 the human race could be devouring 140 billion tons of minerals, ores, fossil fuels and biomass per year—three times its current rate of consumption—unless nations can make serious attempts at decoupling. The report noted that citizens of developed countries consume an average of 16 tons of those four key resources per capita per annum (ranging up to 40 or more tons per person in some developed countries). By comparison, the average person in India today consumes four tons per year. Sustainability studies analyse ways to reduce resource intensity (the amount of resource (e.g. water, energy, or materials) needed for the production, consumption and disposal of a unit of good or service) whether this be achieved from improved economic management, product design, or new technology.|$|E
