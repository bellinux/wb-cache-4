40|$|AbstractThe {{aim of the}} {{experimental}} work is statistical analysis of the novels by observing the frequency of letters, words, and n-grams of four books: two books by Dino Buzzati a) The Tartar steppe (Il deserto dei Tartari) and b) The Colomber (Il colombre); and two books by Oscar Wilde a) The portrait of Dorian Gray and b) The ballad of Reading Gaol. Books have been received in the original versions written by its authors and their respective English – Italian translations and vice versa. For statistical analysis are used two programs: Firstly, it is a program built by us which analyzes the text in English and Italian {{and at the end}} gives the frequency of each of the letters; Secondly, it is <b>used</b> <b>antconc,</b> a concordance and n-grams program. Such analysis can lead us to the identification of any logical fact or not (a-logical) fact between connections that might have the basic material and its translation, in Literature knowledge and inter cultural communication; which is a fundamental key of today's society relationships...|$|E

Abstract— This work compares firstly, the {{differences}} that occur in “The Mystery of Edwin Drood” which was written by two different authors, Garfield and Dickens. And, secondly, {{the differences}} of the original text of the Quran and a translated version of it by Abdullah Yusuf Ali. In translation there are differences which occur {{in the frequency of}} the prophets’ names. Thus, this work seeks to find the occurrences of Moses and Jesus in the Arabic text and compare them to the translated text. Both of the goals in this project are achieved <b>using</b> <b>Antconc</b> and Aconcord, tools provided with many features that help the computation of words frequencies...|$|R
40|$|Writing {{traditions of}} {{different}} disciplines of study are linguistically uniquely ritualized {{in the way}} writers present their arguments. Claims in other subjects are strengthened by showing commitment through boosting devices while other subjects recommending detached way of writing through hedging. The present study was undertaken to investigate the culture of writing in literature subject by analyzing dissertation abstracts of PhD candidates in the field using Hyland’s (2005) metadiscourse taxonomy. Sixty abstracts, from 2007 to 2012, were selected and analysed <b>using</b> <b>AntConc</b> concordance tool supplemented by manual analysis. The study discovers that literature PhD candidates hedge three times more than they use boosters favoring the use of low commitment modal auxiliary can and solidarity phrases. They boost only when they are convinced that their claims share some universal understanding. The study recommends that lessons on hedging and boosting need {{to be included in}} the research writing subjects of novice writers for them to be more conversant with the conventions of research writing that strictly obeys the required formality...|$|R

This project seeks to examine how the unique characteristics of internet language use create a register distinct from in-person conversation. This question will be examined {{through the use of}} a large collection of texts (currently 13, 523 words) pulled from online discussions from sites with different rules, levels of anonymity, and communities. These texts will be analyzed <b>using</b> <b>AntConc,</b> a program designed for the analysis of large collections of text (corpora). Lists of the most frequently occurring words, lists of frequently co-occurring words, and other tools will be used to determine linguistic characteristics of this register. Although not complete, a preliminary analysis of the corpus shows the presence of vulgar words is in a positive correlation with the level of anonymity of the site. This project will be useful in characterizing a register of language that is widely used. It also may shed light on how anonymity and membership in online communities impacts language choice...|$|R

The {{second and third}} aimed to extract terms related to the Indian material culture in works by Koch-Grünberg; the purpose: compile a bilingual glossary.   The first and second researches, using tools Word List, Concordance, and File View, shortly allowed extraction of large number of terms, whose frequency was reliably established. The third, in initial phase, {{will allow us to}} enlarge the results produced with the second, presently with 257 terms and their translation...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, many celebrities use Instagram {{to connect}} with their fans. Unfortunately, for some celebrities, their {{popularity}} may {{not necessarily mean that}} they are liked by the public. The keyboard warriors, i. e. haters can freely hit the keyboard and leave hate comments as cyber communication does not require face-to-face interactions. Some of them even go so far by creating haters’ accounts of certain public figures, as can be found on @mulanjameelaqueen, created by the haters of Mulan Jameela, an Indonesian singer known for her affairs and unregistered marriage with her friend’s husband. This paper explores how being “another” woman is perceived in Indonesia. Mateo and Yus’ (2013) pragmatic taxonomy of insults was used as the framework of analysis. The data were taken from the captions and the comments of 10 of the most commented posts of @mulanjameelaqueen. They were processed by <b>using</b> <b>AntConc</b> to obtain the most frequently used words and their collocations, and the word clusters. The results show that the most commonly used lexicons to refer to Mulan are: cireng ‘traditional snack’, lonte ‘whore’, Jamilonte or Mulonte (coined from Mulan Jameela and lonte ‘prostitute’), and iblis ‘devil’. The malicious comments are mostly related to Mulan’s physical appearance, death threat to Mulan, divorce, and nikah siri ‘unregistered marriage’. The comments may also reflect most of the haters’ (mostly females) negative perception and judgement on unregistered marriage, divorced female, and “another” woman. ...|$|R
40|$|Lexical Semantic is a {{subfield}} of semantics. Semantics {{is generally}} {{defined as a}} study of meaning {{in a variety of}} genres; whereas lexical semantic is a focus of meaning on lexical level. This study focuses on metaphor; the idea that we can state the meaning of words in terms of their association with other words. This study aims to identify the metaphor of anatomy used in the Malay language, studying a particular part of the anatomy that gives certain meaning, and to analyze metaphor of anatomy based on the types of meaning. This study focuses on metaphors and the types of meaning, that used in the text, namely Karya Agung Pantun Melayu: Pantun Melayu Bingkisan Permata (2001) published by Yayasan Karyawan and Kurik Kundi Merah Saga (2005) published by Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka. The corpora are processed <b>using</b> <b>Antconc</b> 3. 2. 4. w, a computer-aided software through concordance technique. The study uses Field Theory of Meaning (TMM) or Semantic Field Theory to identify the lexical that belongs to the same domain. Semantic approach is used to analyze the significance of the types of meaning. This study proves that there are elements of anatomy as a source of meaning in Malay Pantun. Each part of anatomy also has its own meaning shown through fields of meaning. The importance of context also clearly shown by this study, which means meaning is not complete without context...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} use of metaphorical {{language}} in The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda. Vivekananda {{is one of the}} most influential modern-day Hindu scholars, and his interpretation of the ancient Hindu scriptural lore is very significant. Vivekananda’s influence was part of the motivation for choosing his Complete Works as the empirical domain for the current study. Vivekananda’s Complete Works were mined <b>using</b> <b>AntConc,</b> for water-related terms which seemed to have a predilection for metaphoricity. Which terms to search for specifically was determined after a manual reading of a sample from the Complete Works. The data was then tagged, using a convention inspired by the well-known MIPVU procedure for metaphor identification. Thereafter, a representative sample of the data was chosen, and the metaphors were mapped and analysed thematically. This study had as its main aim to investigate whether Hindu religious discourse uses metaphors to explain abstract religious concepts, and if so, whether this happens in the same way as in Judaeo-Christian traditions. Furthermore, following Jäkel (2002), a set of sub-hypotheses pertaining to ubiquity, domains, models, unidirectionality, invariance, necessity, creativity and focussing is assessed. Key findings in this study include a general confirmation of the above-mentioned hypotheses, with the exception of ‘invariance’, which proved to be somewhat contentious. The data allowed for the postulation of underlying conceptual metaphors, which differed somewhat from the metaphors used in traditional Judaeo-Christian philosophy. Linguistics and Modern LanguagesD.

40|$|Management {{foreword}} is an unedited qualitative {{section of}} Corporate Annual Reports (CARs). It is also considered {{as the most}} widely read section of CARs which may reveal the financial condition of the company. So far, only few language studies have embarked on analysis of this section and they have mainly focused on the genre content of management foreword rather than its genre structure. Nevertheless, the few genre studies conducted had several shortcomings in the model proposed. Besides, none of the previously move analysis studies on management foreword have considered corpus analysis tools in their procedure of analysis. Accordingly, {{the present study is}} aimed to bridge the gap in previous studies by describing the genre structure of management forewords. To that aim, a qualitative genre analysis study was conducted on 64 samples of management forewords of Asian companies <b>using</b> <b>AntConc</b> software. The analysis revealed six moves and nineteen move-strategy combinations. Most of the identified moves and strategies were also identified in previous move analysis studies on management forewords and other types of business reports and hence verified. The proposed move analysis model defined move boundaries and provided the most frequent words and verbs that represent each move. Additionally, the proposed moves consist of predictable strategies which are bound to their moves and do not appear within the boundary of more than one move. The findings of the present study could be useful for ESP practitioners as teaching material and raise awareness among business ESP students about the genre conventions of this genre...|$|R
40|$|In any terminological study, {{candidate}} term extraction {{is a very}} time-consuming task. Corpus {{analysis tools}} have automatized some processes allowing the detection of relevant data within the texts, facilitating term candidate selection as well. Nevertheless, these tools are (normally) not specific for terminology research; therefore, the units which are automatically extracted need manual evaluation. Over {{the last few years}} some software products have been specifically developed for automatic term extraction. They are based on corpus analysis, but use linguistic and statistical information to filter data more precisely. As a result, the time needed for manual evaluation is reduced. In this framework, we tried to understand if and how these new tools can really be an advantage. In order to develop our project, we simulated a terminology study: we chose a domain (i. e. legal framework for medicinal products for human use) and compiled a corpus from which we extracted terms and phraseologisms <b>using</b> <b>AntConc,</b> a corpus analysis tool. Afterwards, we compared our list with the lists extracted automatically from three different tools (TermoStat Web, TaaS e Sketch Engine) in order to evaluate their performance. In the first chapter we describe some principles relating to terminology and phraseology in language for special purposes and show the advantages offered by corpus linguistics. In the second chapter we illustrate some of the main concepts of the domain selected, {{as well as some of}} the main features of legal texts. In the third chapter we describe automatic term extraction and the main criteria to evaluate it; moreover, we introduce the term-extraction tools used for this project. In the fourth chapter we describe our research method and, in the fifth chapter, we show our results and draw some preliminary conclusions on the performance and usefulness of term-extraction tools. ...|$|R

It aims to investigate some features of the linguistic systems involved {{from the perspective of}} the experiential component of the ideational metafunction (Halliday & Matthiessen, 2004). The participants were annotated and their tags were <b>used</b> on <b>AntConc</b> to obtain data quantification. Results show that these participants are realised in five types of ideational clauses, being the material, mental, and verbal clauses the more frequent ones. It is concluded that these participants are realised more often functioning as Logical Subjects with respect to the various ideational meanings, which points to their configuration as doers of action...|$|R
40|$|The paper explores intratextual {{multilingualism}} in A Clockwork Orange (ACO) by Anthony Burgess, {{and in two}} of its translations - into Czech and German. It analyses 180 {{words from}} Nadsat - the invented language in ACO - to reveal how lexical creativity is manifested in translation, i. e. whether and how lexical creativity that {{is present in the}} original text is changed in the translations. Changes in lexical creativity are linked to normalisation (a translation universal), and to the functions of the invented language. An existing classification of forms and functions of intratextual multilingualism is applied to invented languages and, in particular, to Nadsat. The analysis of Nadsat and its counterparts in the translations is quantitative, and is conducted <b>using</b> the concordancers <b>AntConc</b> and ParaConc. It examines the frequency of Nadsat words, their distribution throughout the text, and the way their meaning is conveyed to the reader. These data are then used in the comparison of Nadsat and the invented languages that replace it in the Czech and the German translations. The analysis shows that in both translations the number of invented lemmas is lower than in the original, and that in the German translation (UO) the number is significantly lower compared to the Czech translation (MP). In total, MP [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} project {{makes use of}} multiple linguistic and sociological theories. Using Critical Discourse Analysis (as developed by Fairclough 2001, 2013, Wodak 1995, 1997, and van Dijk 2001), and corpus linguistics (following Baker 2012, Baker et al., 2008 and Xiao & McEnery, 2005 - see Website Reference 4), it attempts to critically discuss the language evident in a corpus constructed from transcribed sport broadcasts televised in South Africa, interrogated with the <b>use</b> of <b>AntConc</b> software, maintaining a particular focus on gender representation. It does this {{with the help of}} CMT (Contemporary Metaphor Theory) as developed by Lakoff and Johnson (1980) and Lakoff (1993), which allows for the deconstruction and categorisation of metaphorical mappings in the data. With the help of CMT I describe the cognitive mapping of competition through war terminology and uncover a diligent committal to discourses which support hegemonic masculinity, as well as an underlying ideology that purports that rules are breakable and rule infringement will not be significantly penalised (particularly for men). Special attention is paid to collocating language and the ability of these terms to infuse a subject with an evaluative aura. This involves, in particular: using wordlists to identify pertinent content words in the corpus, addressing collocates to reveal semantic prosodies in the text, and analysing concordance data to see how particular discursive strategies were used in context. Particular interest is paid to the depictions of masculinity seen in sport as a potential reflection of the views held in competitive sport playing societies at large, and to this end it focuses on language and imagery which is used in the discursive construction of the terms: men, women, champion, and physicality. The ideology of male hegemony is found to be dominant in the corpus data, seen in, among other things: the positioning of women, the inclusion of traditional discourses relating to the performance of masculinity and the construction of the 'new man'. White, heterosexual men are shown to be represented as exemplars of hegemonic masculinity, subordinating both black and homosexual men. Laughter is also seen as affirmation of the naturalised cheekiness of men and boys and their tendency to break rules in order to succeed, and betting is identified as a potentially destructive influence in sport...|$|R
