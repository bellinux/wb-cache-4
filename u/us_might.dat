25|$|Altogether, {{these events}} were {{interpreted}} by some Colombian and foreign analysts as {{a turning point}} in the armed confrontation, giving the FARC the upper hand in the military and political balance, making the Colombian government a target of critics from some observers who concluded that its weakness was being evidenced, perhaps even overshadowing a future guerrilla victory in the middle term. A leaked 1998 U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) report went so far as to speculate that this could be possible within 5 years if the guerrilla's rate of operations was kept up without effective opposition. Some viewed this report as inaccurate and alarmist, claiming that it did not properly take into account many factors, such as possible actions that the Colombian state and the <b>U.S.</b> <b>might</b> take in response to the situation, nor the effects of the existence of paramilitary groups.|$|E
25|$|In {{the year}} 2001, the National Automobile Dealers Association {{conducted}} a study revealing {{the average age of}} vehicles in operation in the US. The study found that of vehicles in operation in the US, 38.3% were older than ten years, 22.3% were between seven and ten years old, 25.8% were between three and six years old, and 13.5% were less than two years old. According to this study the majority of vehicles, 60.6%, of vehicles were older than seven years in 2001. This relatively high age of automobiles in the <b>US</b> <b>might</b> be explained by unaffordable prices for comparable new replacement vehicles and a corresponding gradual decline in sales figures since 1998. Also, many Americans own three or more vehicles. The low marginal cost of registering and insuring additional older vehicles, many of which are rarely used, could cause the study to be skewed as these vehicles are still given full weight in the statistics.|$|E

25|$|We must {{single out}} the {{children}} who are endowed with high potentialities, and develop them as completely as possible. And in this manner give to the nation a non-hereditary aristocracy. Such children may be found in all classes of society, although distinguished men appear more frequently in distinguished families than in others. The descendants of the founders of American civilization may still possess the ancestral qualities. These qualities are generally hidden under the cloak of degeneration. But this degeneration is often superficial. It comes chiefly from education, idleness, lack of responsibility and moral discipline. The sons of very rich men, like those of criminals, should be removed while still infants from their natural surroundings. Thus separated from their family, they could manifest their hereditary strength. In the aristocratic families of Europe there are also individuals of great vitality. The issue of the Crusaders is by no means extinct. The laws of genetics indicate the probability that the legendary audacity and love of adventure can appear again in the lineage of the feudal lords. It is possible also that the offspring of the great criminals who had imagination, courage, and judgment, of the heroes of the French or Russian Revolutions, of the high-handed business men who live among <b>us,</b> <b>might</b> be excellent building stones for an enterprising minority. As we know, criminality is not hereditary if not united with feeble-mindedness or other mental or cerebral defects. High potentialities are rarely encountered in the sons of honest, intelligent, hard-working men who have had ill luck in their careers, who have failed in business or have muddled along all their lives in inferior positions. Or among peasants living on the same spot for centuries. However, from such people sometimes spring artists, poets, adventurers, saints. A brilliantly gifted and well-known New York family came from peasants who cultivated their farm in the south of France from the time of Charlemagne to that of Napoleon.|$|E

In the following months, Borah was a leader of the Irreconcilables. [...] An especial target was Article X of the charter, obligating all members to defend each other's independence. The Irreconcilables argued that this would commit the U.S. to war without its consent; Borah stated that the <b>U.S.</b> <b>might</b> be forced to send thousands of men if there was conflict in Armenia. Other provisions were examined; Borah proposed that the U.S. representatives in Paris be asked to press the issue of Irish independence, but the Senate took no action. Borah found the provisions of the treaty regarding Germany to be shocking in their vindictiveness, and feared they might snuff out the new Weimar Republic at birth.|$|E
500|$|Scholarly {{speculation}} in {{the late}} nineteenth century postulated that kings X derived from kings truce, rendered as kings cruse and then kings excuse, becoming kings X as a shortened form. The Dictionary of American Regional English cites the Opies as a source for the derivation of the terms and states that exes probably refers to the use of crossed fingers, an important part of the demand for a truce, rather than deriving from [...] "excuse" [...] as originally thought. However, the Knapps state that although the Opies do not record kings X as such in the UK, they do record kings, crosses, exes, cruse and truce. They conclude that kings X derived from the users of kings and exes settling in the same areas of the US—the terms were then combined and shortened. Kings cruse, once popular in the <b>US,</b> <b>might</b> be accounted for in a similar manner. Barley has been recorded as a truce term in Ohio, Wisconsin, and Virginia.|$|E

Eisenhower to the United Nations, a reporter with the Associated Press visited Castle Air Force Base in California after SAC was alerted to support whatever action the <b>U.S.</b> <b>might</b> take. The reporter was unable to find out classified information, and instead invented maintenance records of the fleet that painted a dismal picture. On 24 and 25 November, four B-52's of the 93rd Bombardment Wing and the 42nd flew nonstop around the perimeter of North America in Operation Quick Kick, which covered [...] in 31 hours, 30 minutes. SAC noted the flight time could have been reduced by 5 to 6 hours if the four inflight refuelings had been done by fast jet-powered tanker aircraft rather than propeller-driven KC-97 Stratofreighters.

500|$|In Chomsky's view, the {{invasion}} of Iraq by a U.S. and U.K. coalition must {{be seen in the}} wider context of the U.S. government's Imperial Grand Strategy. He claims that the Iraq invasion fits the three criteria that he has highlighted for being classified as a U.S. target for preventative war. Considering the country [...] "virtually defenseless" [...] against the superior might of the western armed forces, he also notes that securing control of the country would be an important move for the U.S. socio-economic elite, gaining unlimited access to the country's lucrative oil resources and asserting their own military might to intimidate other nations into compliance. He also argued that government and media propaganda also set out to forge an erroneous link between Iraq President Saddam Hussein and Al-Qaeda, playing on the American people's horror of the 9/11 attacks. Furthermore, he stated that they also wrongly claimed that the Iraqi government was developing weapons of mass destruction to be used against the U.S. or its allies. Chomsky remarks that the 2003 invasion of Iraq is particularly significant because it signals the [...] "new norm" [...] in international relations, and that in future the <b>U.S.</b> <b>might</b> be willing to wage a preventative war against [...] "Iran, Syria, the Andean region, and a number of others." ...|$|E
500|$|Views in the U.S. press were mixed. In {{a review}} for The New York Times, current U.S. {{ambassador}} to the United Nations, Harvard scholar, and Pulitzer Prize winner Samantha Power described the book as a [...] "raging and often meandering assault" [...] on U.S. foreign policy. Believing that Chomsky divides the world into two camps, the oppressor and the oppressed, she asserts that in Hegemony or Survival he portrays the U.S. as [...] "the prime oppressor, [...] can do no right", meanwhile overlooking the crimes of the oppressed. Arguing that he completely ignores the concept that the <b>U.S.</b> <b>might</b> undertake any foreign interventions with good intentions, she asserts that his book {{is not easy to}} read, and that his [...] "glib and caustic tone" [...] are distracting. Furthermore, she highlights problems with his use of end notes, particularly when some of these notes simply reference his earlier publications. Although disagreeing with his arguments, she believed that reading his book was [...] "sobering and instructive", having value in illustrating how many non-Americans viewed the U.S. and highlighting many of the [...] "structural defects" [...] in U.S. foreign policy. Furthermore, recognizing that Chomsky's [...] "critiques have come to influence and reflect mainstream opinion elsewhere in the world," [...] she concedes that Chomksy's analysis has a coherence that, for many, resolves much of the post-9/11 confusion and disillusionment stemming from the Bush administration's standard response to the question, [...] "Why do they hate us?".|$|E
500|$|Krrish {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics in India. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama {{believed that the}} film surpassed expectations, but felt that there were issues with pacing in first hour. Overall, he deemed Krrish to be [...] "a terrifically exciting and compelling experience", and awarded the film 4.5 of 5 stars. Nikhat Kazmi noted in The Times of India that while the superhero and action sequences were appealing, there were not enough of them. He was also not excited by the romantic parts, comparing them to a sightseeing tour, first in India and then in Singapore. He said that overall, this film lacks the fun of its predecessor. On the other hand, Raja Sen said that Krrish was infinitely better than KMG, though ultimately {{it was all about}} Hrithik Roshan. Sen and Sukanya Verma, writing for Rediff, both gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, and both said {{that it was a good}} film for children. Sen summarised [...] "So, is it a good superhero movie? No, but it's well-intentioned. It's a full-on kiddie movie, and while a lot of <b>us</b> <b>might</b> be scornful of Krrish, it's heartening to see fantasy officially entering mainstream Bollywood." [...] Verma agreed with other critics that it took too long for the action to get started, and said that a lot of attention was spent showing off Roshan's muscles. He summarised, [...] "Krrish neither has the sleek aura nor the deep-rooted ideology of superheroes. What it does have is a super spirited performance from Hrithik Roshan, which is likely to appeal to children. And that's worth a three-star cheer." [...] Saibal Chatterjee wrote in the Hindustan Times that Krrish is a hackneyed, formulaic masala film, with special effects added on top, and hoped that this would not be the future of Bollywood. Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN condemned the screenplay and thought that the only thing that made the film watchable was the acting of Hrithik Roshan. He gave the film only 2 out of 5 stars, saying [...] "Krrish is only an average film that could have been so much better if the makers had concentrated as hard on its story as they did on its action and stunts." ...|$|E
