5|$|The VP {{update of}} 1991 {{featured}} cosmetic changes and mechanical however most were not visible <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{to pull the}} motor down; and a very similar revised 3.8-litre V6 and 5.0-litre V8 engines from the VN were carried over. The 2.0-litre straight-four engine previously available in New Zealand was discontinued. Exterior cosmetic changes included a translucent acrylic grille on the base level Executive and Berlina, with a colour-coded grille for the S and SS, and a chrome grille for Calais. Updated tail lights and boot garnishes were {{also a part of}} the changes, which were different for each model, with the Berlina having grey stripes and the Calais chrome stripes. Semi-trailing arm independent rear suspension became standard on the Calais and SS, but was made an option on lower-end models in lieu of the live rear axle, improving ride and handling.|$|E
500|$|Money {{was very}} tight in Villeneuve's early career. He was a {{professional}} racing driver from his late teens, with no other income. In {{the first few years}} the bulk of his income actually came from snowmobile racing, where he was extremely successful. He could demand appearance money as well as race money, especially after winning the 1974 World Championship Snowmobile Derby. His second season in Formula Atlantic was part-sponsored by his snowmobile manufacturer, Skiroule. He credited some of his success to his snowmobiling days: [...] "Every winter, you would reckon on three or four big spills — and I'm talking about being thrown on to the ice at 100 miles per hour. Those things used to slide a lot, which taught me a great deal about control. And the visibility was terrible! <b>Unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> leading, you could see nothing, with all the snow blowing about. Good for the reactions — and it stopped me having any worries about racing in the rain." ...|$|E
500|$|The Confessions Tour {{received}} positive critical response. Steve Baltin of Rolling Stone wrote: [...] "Madonna {{had played}} many {{roles in the}} first night of her Confessions tour – but confessor was not one of them. Apparently, in all the pomp and circumstance, {{there was no room for}} warmth, or even the attitude that made her recent Coachella festival performance so memorable." [...] Don Chareunsy of The San Diego Union-Tribune commented that Madonna's previous tours, Drowned World Tour (2001) and Re-Invention World Tour (2004), [...] "were excellent concerts... but she stepped it up a few notches" [...] for the Confessions Tour. Ben Wener of The Orange County Register reported that [...] "No one – but no one – stages elaborate eye-candy productions like Madonna, whose highly impressive Confessions Tour opened Sunday night at a packed Forum so sweltering it seemed as though it were being prepped for the world's largest Bikram yoga session." [...] Lina Das from the Daily Mail complimented the show, saying that Madonna still had the ability to grab the headlines with her shock tactics. Thomas Inskeep from Stylus Magazine complimented the finale of the tour saying, [...] "There's not a better way the Confessions Tour could’ve closed." [...] Tom Young from the BBC called the show [...] "a big fat neon light of a pop-dance explosion. There's a party going on, and <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> there in the first place, you’re not invited. Whistles and whoops rarely cease and applause ripples throughout building into regular raptures for a consistently first-class performer. It's almost enough to make those who weren’t there jealous. Almost." ...|$|E

2500|$|Artists, designers, {{engravers}} {{and administrative}} officials {{are involved with}} the choice of subject matter and the method of printing stamps. Early stamp images were almost always produced from engravings — a design etched into a steel die, which was then hardened and whose impression was transferred to a printing plate. Using an engraved image was deemed a more secure way of printing stamps as it was nearly impossible to counterfeit a finely detailed image with raised lines <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> a master engraver. In the mid-20th century, stamp issues produced by other forms of printing began to emerge, such as [...] lithography, photogravure, intaglio and web offset printing. These later printing methods were less expensive and typically produced images of lesser quality.|$|E
2500|$|Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode {{positive}} review, {{giving it a}} B-. However, she pointed out that [...] "I’m having trouble with Merida’s entry into OUAT season five because I’m just not that invested in the character. Not that she isn’t a plucky little heroine—oh God, she’s plucky!—but because her own backstory and mythology doesn’t offer is a lot. Snow is now a terrible character, but her story was always rich with possibilities: the apple, the mriror, the queen, the hunter, even the dwarves. Everyone knows that story, even if they don’t know they know it. But if you didn’t check out Brave in the theater a few summers ago—which you probably wouldn’t do <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> a small child or had a small child yourself— you would {{have no idea where}} there are bears running around all over the place this episode." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{with the}} prototype, a large {{proportion}} of the Minicar was made from different aluminium alloys. The main body was a very simple construction of 18swg sheet with a 14swg main bulkhead. The integrity of the main stressed skin structure was enhanced by the absence of doors, the bodysides being deemed low enough to be stepped over without major inconvenience (<b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> wearing a skirt). Most of the bodywork panels were flat or fairly simple curves whilst the compound curves of the bonnet and rear mudguard arches were pressed out as separate panels. The windscreen was made from Perspex. The car was alleged to weigh only [...] “all-in” or [...] dry and its light weight was regularly demonstrated by one person lifting the entire rear end of the car off the ground unaided.

2500|$|... "God Only Knows" [...] is {{frequently}} cited for referencing [...] "God" [...] in its title, {{a decision that}} Wilson and Asher agonized over, fearing it would not get airplay as a result. As Wilson's then-wife Marilyn describes, [...] "The first time I heard it, Brian played it {{for me at the}} piano. And I went, 'Oh my God, he's talking about God in a record.' It was pretty daring to me. And it was another time I thought to myself, 'Oh, boy, he's really taking a chance.' I thought it was almost too religious. Too square. At that time. Yes, it was so great that he would say it and not be intimidated by what anybody else would think of the words or what he meant." [...] Asher explains that he and Brian [...] "had lengthy conversations during the writing of 'God Only Knows', because <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> Kate Smith and you were singing 'God Bless America', no one thought you could say 'God' in a song. No one had done it, and Brian didn't want to be the first person to try it. He said, 'We'll just never get any air play.' Isn't it amazing that we thought that? But it worked." [...] Wilson added that although he feared putting the word [...] "God" [...] in the title of the song, he eventually agreed to keep it, firstly, [...] "because God was a spiritual word", and secondly, because the Beach Boys would [...] "be breaking ground".|$|E
