Drawing on the emerging field of cultural psychology, this article offers a conceptual and methodological framework to guide the investigation of genuine <b>universals</b> through empirical analysis of psychological patterns across cultures. Issues of cross cultural generalizability of psychological processes, and three cross cultural research strategies to probe <b>universals,</b> are considered. Four distinct levels of hierarchically organized <b>universals</b> are possible: from strongest to weakest claims for universality, accessibility <b>universals,</b> functional <b>universals,</b> existential <b>universals,</b> and non-universals.

50|$|Idealists, such as Kant and Hegel, posit that <b>universals</b> are not real, but are {{ideas in}} the mind of {{rational}} beings.

30|$|If {{values are}} <b>universals,</b> then {{a number of}} ontological presuppositions are {{virtually}} accepted and the related problems necessarily appear.

The instantiation of <b>universals</b> {{is one of the greatest}} problems of realist ontology. In simple words, those who accept the distinction between particulars and <b>universals,</b> need to explain how the latter get instantiated by the former entities. Most realists today reject the Platonic view that ideas (<b>universals)</b> may exist separately from particulars. Their typical view is that only instantiated <b>universals</b> exist. All we can know about particulars are expressed by <b>universals,</b> particulars themselves (in a ‘bare’ state) are inaccessible. Still, they must be presupposed, otherwise the plurality of things would collapse into a single entity. But then it is a problem of how <b>universals</b> get instantiated by particulars.|$|R

5000|$|Taking {{a broader}} view, the main {{positions}} are generally considered classifiable as: realism, nominalism, and idealism (sometimes simply named [...] "anti-realism" [...] {{with regard to}} <b>universals).</b> Realists posit the existence of independent, abstract <b>universals</b> to account for attribute agreement.
