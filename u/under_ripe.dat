25|$|The {{effectiveness}} of water stress {{is an area}} of continuing research in viticulture. Of particular focus is the connection between yield size and the potential benefits of water stress. Since the act of stressing the vine does contribute to reduce photosynthesis-and by extension, reduce ripening since the sugars produced by photosynthesis is needed for grape development-it is possible that a stressed vine with high yields will only produce lots of <b>under</b> <b>ripe</b> grapes. Another interest of study is the potential impact on white grape varieties with enologists and viticulturists such as Cornelius Van Leeuwen and Catherine Peyrot Des Gachons contending that white grape varieties lose some of their aromatic qualities when subjugated to even mild forms of water stress.|$|E
25|$|The Loire river has a {{significant}} effect on the mesoclimate of the region, adding the necessary extra few degrees of temperature that allows grapes to grow when the areas to the north and south of the Loire Valley have shown to be unfavourable to viticulture.

2500|$|Whole-cluster {{pressing}} {{is where}} instead of first sending the grapes through a destemmer/crusher the intact grapes are directly pressed {{still attached to}} the stems. This is a method that is widely used for white, rosé and sparkling wine production because it usually produces a more delicate, less phenolic and less colored wine.

The ripening periods for each individual grape variety will vary with grapes such as Cabernet Sauvignon taking much longer to ripen compared to early ripening varieties such as Chardonnay and Pinot noir.|$|E
40|$|A hash {{function}} provides services of information security, authentication, integrity and non-reputation in {{a branch of}} information security.

It is required a hash function with variable output length that can take a suitable output length by systems. HAVAL is the first hash function with variable output length, which was proposed by Zheng et al. HAS-V based on HAVAL- 1 was proposed by N. K. Park et al.

40|$|Summary. Ovarian {{function}} was studied in thirty-eight does suckling at least four, and usually six to eight, young each. A balanced pellet diet was available at all times. <b>Under</b> these conditions, <b>ripe</b> follicles {{were present in}} the ovaries but the corpora lutea regressed rapidly following parturition {{and the size of the}} ovaries and uterus decreased as suckling continued. A basal progesterone output could not be quantified but the release of 20 =ahydroxypregn- 4 -en- 3 -one,expressed as =m/govary/hr, tended to rise throughout lactation. In six of the seven suckled does which were allowed to mate post partum, pregnancy was maintained, indicating that sufficient oestrogen was produced by the follicles to maintain luteal function. The results support the concept that neither lactation nor the suckling stimulus suppresses fsh and lh release, since the presumed oestrogen production continues when adequate nourish-ment is available...|$|R
40|$|Ubiquitin is well {{established}} as a major modifier of signaling in eukaryotes. However {{the extent to which}} plants rely on ubiquitin for regulating nutrient uptake is still in its infancy. The main characteristic of ubiquitination is the conjugation of ubiquitin onto lysine residues of acceptor proteins.

The Ubiquitin-Proteasome System is responsible for removing most abnormal peptides and short-lived cellular regulators, which, in turn, control many processes. This allows cells to respond rapidly to intracellular signals and changing environmental conditions. This perspective will discuss how plants utilize ubiquitin conjugation for sensing environmental nutrient levels. We will highlight recent advances in understanding how ubiquitin aids nutrient homeostasis by affecting the trafficking of membrane bound transporters.

40|$|The {{power of}} {{high-level}} languages lies in their abstraction over {{hardware and software}} complexity, leading to greater security, better reliability, and lower development costs. However, opaque abstractions are often show-stoppers for systems programmers, forcing them to either break the abstraction, or more often, simply give up and use a different language. This paper addresses the challenge of opening up a high-level language to allow practical low-level programming without forsaking integrity or performance. The contribution {{of this paper is}} three-fold: 1) we draw together common threads in a diverse literature, 2) we identify a framework for extending high-level languages for low-level programming, and 3) we show the power of this approach through concrete case studies. Our framework leverages just three core ideas: extending semantics via intrinsic methods, extending types via unboxing and architectural-width primitives, and controlling semantics via scoped semantic regimes. We develop these ideas through the context of a rich literature and substantial practical experience. We show that they provide the power necessary to implement substantial artifacts such as a high-performance virtual machine, while preserving the software engineering benefits of the host language. The time has come for high-level low-level programming to be taken more seriously: 1) more projects now use high-level languages for systems programming, 2) increasing architectural heterogeneity and parallelism heighten the need for abstraction, and 3) a new generation of high-level languages are <b>under</b> development and <b>ripe</b> to be influenced...|$|R

Fruits are first green, turning yellow as they ripen. The fully mature fruit is entirely red, soft, juicy with wrinkled skin and has a pleasant aroma. The ripe fruit is sweet and sour in taste. Both flesh texture and taste are reminiscent of apples. When <b>under</b> <b>ripe</b> the flesh is white and crispy, acid to subacid to sweet in taste. Fully ripe fruits are less crisp and somewhat mealy; overripe fruits are wrinkled, the flesh buff-coloured, soft, spongy and musky.
