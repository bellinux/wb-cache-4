5|$|In 2017, the Series again drew criticism, {{this time}} for {{allowing}} games to be called early because of weather and treating them as official games. After the Yokohama BayStars lost a 5-inning game in the 2017 Central League Climax Series, Coskrey wrote that playoff games should never end like in that manner. He suggested that NPB could have easily suspended the game and resumed where it left off {{the next day or}} even postponed the game entirely <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the extreme}} south, the six border battalions in the {{province}} of Limburg only slightly delayed the advance of the German Sixth Army; before noon the area had been overrun and the strategic city of Maastricht had surrendered, opening the way for the German feint offensive into Central Belgium. The Germans however, failed to capture the main bridge intact, forcing them to delay the crossing by the 4th Panzer Division <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E

5|$|Delayed by {{the late}} arrival of the York garrison, it was late evening before the Royalists were fully deployed. A flurry of rain showers and the discouragement of Newcastle and Eythin persuaded Rupert to delay his attack <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day.</b> From {{the ranks of the}} allied army he could hear the singing of psalms. As the Royalist troops broke ranks for their supper, Leven noted the lack of {{preparation}} among his opponents and ordered his men to attack at or shortly after 7:30pm, just as a thunderstorm broke out over the moor.|$|E
5|$|Vince {{developed}} from an extratropical system on 8 October, becoming a subtropical storm {{southeast of the}} Azores. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) did not officially name the storm <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> shortly before Vince became a hurricane. The storm weakened at sea and made landfall on the Iberian Peninsula as a tropical depression on 11 October. Vince was the first tropical system to do so since the 1842 Spanish hurricane. It dissipated over Spain, bringing much needed rain to the region, and its remnants passed into the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E

5|$|AFIS {{made several}} {{attempts}} {{to call up}} the aircraft. It {{received a call from}} a resident close to Torghatten which said they had heard aircraft noise followed by a crash. Brønnøysund Fire Department and an ambulance helicopter with a doctor was dispatched to Torghatten. The rescue work was made difficult by low clouds, small fires and explosions. The terrain was difficult and the lack of daylight made assisting the situation difficult. A helicopter with medical personnel and the airport direct arrived at 21:25, while a meeting place for the next of kin was established at the airport. At 23:30 the police stated that there was no hope of finding survivors and the scene changed from a search to an investigation scene. Due to the fog {{it was not possible to}} verify that all people had been killed <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day.</b> Seventy-five soldiers from the Home Guard participated in the salvage.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, an {{overpass}} {{being built}} at MD198 over the B–W Parkway {{just east of}} Laurel collapsed during rush hour, injuring fourteen motorists and construction workers. The incident was blamed on faulty scaffolding used to support the uncompleted span. On July 9, 2005, a sinkhole opened beneath the parkway at a construction site, leading to the complete closure of the northbound roadway. The sinkhole was filled with concrete {{to shore up the}} roadbed and prevent further collapse; the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers attempted to expedite repairs, but the route remained closed <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day.</b> On August 24, 2007, both directions of the parkway were closed when chunks of concrete fell from the overpass at MD193 (Greenbelt Road) onto the northbound lanes.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{infantry}} began {{clearing the}} heavily fortified houses {{along the shore}} and advanced on targets further inland. The British Commandos of No. 47 (Royal Marine) Commando advanced on Port-en-Bessin and captured it on 7 June in the Battle of Port-en-Bessin. On the western flank, the 1st Battalion, Hampshire Regiment captured Arromanches (future site {{of one of the}} artificial Mulberry harbours), and 69th Infantry Brigade on the eastern flank made contact with the Canadian forces at Juno. Company Sergeant Major Stanley Hollis received the only Victoria Cross awarded on D-Day for his actions while attacking two pillboxes at the Mont Fleury battery. Due to stiff resistance from the German 352nd Infantry Division, Bayeux was not captured <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day.</b> British casualties at Gold are estimated at 1,000–1,100.

50|$|The {{attempt to}} resettle the Gottscheer was a costly failure for the Nazi regime, since extra {{manpower}} {{was required to}} protect the farmers from the partisans. The deported Slovenes were taken to several camps in Saxony, where {{they were forced to}} work on German farms or in factories run by German industries from 1941 to 1945. The forced labourers were not always kept in formal Nazi concentration camps, but often just vacant buildings where they slept <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day's</b> labour took them outside these quarters. Toward the end of the war, these camps were liberated by American and Red Army troops, and repatriated refugees later returned to Yugoslavia.|$|R
5|$|On July 30, the system's {{circulation}} {{began to}} organize and the first reports of tropical storm-force squalls were reported as it {{moved closer to the}} Texas coast. Based on this the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued tropical storm warnings for much of the Texas and Louisiana coast, from Intracoastal City, Louisiana to Corpus Christi, Texas. Later that afternoon it strengthened into Tropical Storm Dean while located just 70mi (110km) off the coast. The Hurricane Hunters confirmed that Dean strengthened in the final hours before its landfall on the Texas coast to a 45mph (75km/h) storm, and made landfall near Freeport, Texas at 8:30 pm CDT (0130 UTC) July 31. Shortly after its landfall, Dean weakened back to tropical depression strength as it tracked further northwest into Texas. The depression stalled in central Texas on August 1 and remained there for 36 hours <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> dropping heavy rain over parts of the state. Late on August 2, it merged with a non-tropical front and dissipated.|$|E
5|$|The Light Division, {{based at}} Vught, {{was the only}} {{manoeuvre}} force the Dutch Army possessed. Its planned withdrawal had been similarly executed a day early. Its regiments had biked over the Maas and Waal bridges and then turned left through the Alblasserwaard when it was decided in the afternoon to let it counterattack the German airborne landing on IJsselmonde. It reached the Noord, the river separating the Alblasserwaard from IJsselmonde, in the evening. There they discovered that the sector near the only bridge, built in 1939, was not strongly occupied by the airborne troops, as the Germans simply had not known of its existence because of outdated maps. It was decided to postpone a crossing <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> to gather sufficient forces. No {{attempt was made to}} establish a bridgehead.|$|E
5|$|The {{role of the}} Venizelists {{during the}} battle has been {{intensely}} contested by witnesses and historians. Vice admiral Louis Dartige du Fournet wrote that Venizelists supported the Allies and attacked passing Greek royalist army units. Venizelists participation was allegedly so extensive, that lead Admiral du Fourne wrote in his report {{that he had been}} involved in a civil war. The Venizelists continued fighting after the evacuation of the Allied marines <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> when they capitulated. The royalists claimed that large caches of weapons and ammunition were found in their strongholds packed in French military containers. Venizelists were led to prison surrounded by a furious mob and supposedly only the royal army escorts saved them from being murdered by the angry citizens. Other historians deny that the Venizelists collaborated with the Allied forces: Pavlos Karolidis, a contemporary royalist historian, argues that no Venizelist attacked their fellow citizens and the only weapons found during the raids on prominent Venizelists' houses were knives.|$|E

5|$|Astana's Vuelta {{was a quiet}} one. Vinokourov {{placed in}} the top ten of the opening {{individual}} time trial but he {{fell out of the}} top ten of the overall standings the next day due to a crash. Haimar Zubeldia's 18th-place finish on stage 8, which was the Vuelta's first high mountain stage, propelled him into eighth overall <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> when he lost time and fell to ninth. In stage 10, Vinokourov figured in a winning breakaway, but his poor positioning in the four-man sprint finish meant the stage victory went to 's Simon Gerrans. Before stage 12, Astana held ninth overall. They continued to hold it after the stage, but the rider in that position changed; Zubeldia had been in the top ten, but finished further behind stage winner Ryder Hesjedal than Daniel Navarro, so it was Navarro who was the team's highest-placed rider after the stage. After the next two stages, Navarro also fell from the top ten, and the team did not achieve anything further, with Navarro in 13th their highest-placed rider in the race's final standings.|$|E
5|$|On 9 March, the Soviet 40th Army counterattacked {{against the}} Großdeutschland Division {{in a final}} attempt to restore {{communications}} with the 3rd Tank Army. This counterattack, however, was caught by {{the expansion of the}} German offensive towards Kharkov on 10 March. That same day, the 4th Panzer Army issued orders to the SS Panzer Corps to take Kharkov as soon as possible, prompting Hausser to order an immediate attack on the city by the three SS Panzer divisions. The Das Reich would come from the West, the LSSAH would attack from north, and the Totenkopf would provide a protective screen along the north and northwestern flanks. Despite attempts by General Hoth to order Hausser to stick to the original plan, the SS Panzer Corps' commander decided to continue with his own plan of attack on the city, although Soviet defenses forced him to postpone the attack <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day.</b> Manstein issued an order to continue outflanking the city, although leaving room for a potential attack on Kharkov if there was little Soviet resistance, but Hausser decided to disregard the order and continue with his own assault.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Cyclone Lin (RSMC Nadi designation: 14F, JTWC Designation: 15P) {{formed on}} March 31, 2009 as a {{tropical}} depression within a monsoon trough {{to the northwest}} of Fiji. Over the next few days, the depression moved towards the southeast through the Fijian archipelago until late on April 3, when the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in Nadi reported that the depression had intensified into a category one cyclone, and named it Lin. The JTWC did not start issuing warnings on Lin <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> as it was approaching its 10-minute peak windspeeds of 110km/h (70mph) and 1-minute peak windspeeds of 100km/h (65mph). Cyclone Lin then reached its peak windspeeds early on April 5 as it passed directly over Tonga. Later that day as it approached the edge of RSMC Nadi's area of responsibility Lin started to go through an extratropical transition with the JTWC issuing their last advisory on it. As it crossed into TCWC Wellington's area of responsibility the cyclone was declared extratropical, however TCWC Wellington kept issuing warnings on Lin until late on April 8.|$|E

50|$|Most Gottschee {{were as much}} victims as the Slovenians {{deported}} to the Reich, though the former were not used for forced labor as the latter were. The deported Slovenians were taken to several camps in Saxony, Silesia, and elsewhere in Germany where {{they were forced to}} work on German farms or in factories run by German industries from 1941-1945. The forced laborers were not always kept in formal concentration camps, but often just vacant buildings where they slept <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day's</b> labor took them outside these quarters. Toward the close of the war, these camps were liberated by American and Soviet troops, and the later repatriated Slovenian refugees returned to Yugoslavia to find their homes in shambles.

5|$|Under Smith, 1st Battalion emplaced on hills {{overlooking}} the road into Chochiwon, resting {{the night of}} July 11 with no contact from the North Koreans <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day.</b> Just after dawn on July 12, the American battalion first encountered North Korean patrols followed by an attack on their left flank by a North Korean force estimated as battalion sized at 0930. Soon afterward, some 2,000 North Koreans began a direct assault on 1st Battalion's position, supported by heavy artillery. Stephens decided the understrength battalion, with its large percentage of replacements, could not hold its position long and ordered it to withdraw. Smith subsequently moved the battalion from the line one company {{at a time and}} the retreat was orderly. By nightfall, the entire regiment had moved by truck to a blocking position at Taepyong-ni, across the Kum River close to Taejon. In the meantime, U.S. forces on the westerly Kongju road fought a series of minor engagements to delay North Korean forces traveling down that road before retreating across the Kum river.|$|E
5|$|At 12:30 two {{companies}} of the Canterbury Battalion landed and {{were sent to}} support the Aucklands, who had now been ordered back to Plugge's Plateau, and were forming on {{the left of the}} 3rd Brigade. The Canterbury companies moved into the line on the Aucklands' left, waiting {{for the rest of their}} brigade to land. However, between 12:30 and 16:00 not one infantry or artillery formation came ashore. The ships carrying the New Zealanders were in the bay, but the steamers and rowing boats were being used to take the large numbers of wounded to the hospital ship. The transports with the 4th Australian Brigade on board were still well out at sea and not due to land until that evening. The landings recommenced around 16:30 when the Wellington Battalion came ashore, followed by the Otago Battalion around 17:00, who were put into the line beside the Aucklanders. Next to land were the two other Canterbury companies, who were sent north to Walker's Ridge to extend the corps left flank. Events ashore now forced a change in the disembarkation schedule, and at 17:50 orders were issued for the 4th Australian Brigade to start landing to boost the defence. It would take <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> for the complete brigade to come ashore. The transports carrying both divisions' artillery batteries had been forced further out to sea by Turkish artillery fire, and were unable to land.|$|E
5|$|The Regia Aeronautica units {{based in}} Sardinia managed to prepare eight Cr.42 dive-bombers and an escort of nine Re.2001 from 362° Squadriglie and nine SM.79 bombers from Decimomannu. The SM.79s {{failed to find}} the convoy and a Re.2001 was shot down by an 806 Squadron Martlet from Indomitable. The convoy crossed the 10th parallel, beyond which {{aircraft}} based in Sicily could fly with fighter escorts and 105 aircraft were to attack in three waves. Problems with the fighter escorts were encountered, because the Re.2001s of the 2° Gruppo CT had escorted the Sardinia-based bombers and landed in Sardinia and were not available <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day.</b> The torpedo- and dive-bombers were sent to Pantellaria to fly with the 51° Gruppo CT (MC.202s) and avoid the problems of co-ordination when aircraft flew from different bases. Four aircraft were sent on reconnaissance sorties and then four of the Italian Ju87s of 102° Gruppo BT were found to lack long-range tanks and torpedoes could not be attached to six SM.84s. Fulmars from Victorious shot down the SM.79 of Captain Giuseppe Mollo on reconnaissance but a Cant Z1007 maintained contact. Fliegerkorps II arranged to co-ordinate with the Italians but the operations were independent. I Gruppe, Sturzkampfgeschwader 3 (StG 3) had transferred from Trapani to Elmas and at 17:30 twenty Ju87s with Bf 109 escorts took off.|$|E
