5|$|In {{supporting}} Octavian, Antony {{expected to}} gain {{support for his}} own campaign against Parthia, desiring to avenge Rome's defeat at Carrhae in 53BC. In an agreement reached at Tarentum, Antony provided 120 ships for Octavian to <b>use</b> <b>against</b> Pompeius, while Octavian was to send 20,000 legionaries to Antony for <b>use</b> <b>against</b> Parthia. Octavian sent only a tenth of those promised, however, which Antony viewed as an intentional provocation.|$|E
5|$|The large caliber {{guns were}} {{designed}} to fire two different 16-inch shells: an armor-piercing round for anti-ship and anti-structure work and a high explosive round designed for <b>use</b> <b>against</b> unarmored targets and shore bombardment. A third type of ammunition for delivering tactical nuclear warheads was developed subsequently.|$|E
6000|$|It {{must also}} be remembered that this cry of illicit knowledge, backed by more or less {{appropriate}} texts, has been <b>used</b> <b>against</b> every advance of human knowledge. It was <b>used</b> <b>against</b> the new astronomy, and Galileo had actually to recant. It was <b>used</b> <b>against</b> Galvani and electricity. It was <b>used</b> <b>against</b> Darwin, who would certainly have been burned had he lived a few centuries before. It was even <b>used</b> <b>against</b> Simpson's <b>use</b> of chloroform in child-birth, {{on the ground that}} the Bible declared [...] "in pain shall ye bring them forth." [...] Surely a plea which has been made so often, and so often abandoned, cannot be regarded very seriously.|$|R

5|$|During the {{modernization}} in the 1980s, three important weapons {{were added to}} the Iowa-class battleships. The first was the CIWS anti-aircraft/anti-missile system discussed above. The other two were missiles for <b>use</b> <b>against</b> both land and sea targets. At one point the NATO Sea Sparrow was to be installed on the reactivated battleships; however, it was determined that the system could not withstand the over-pressure effects when the main battery was fired.|$|E
5|$|Tarzon saw {{its first}} combat use in December 1950, the ASM-A-1 {{replacing}} the Razon in operational service; the smaller weapon had {{been determined to}} be too small for effective <b>use</b> <b>against</b> bridges and other hardened targets. Used solely by the 19th Bomb Group, which had previously conducted the Razon's combat missions, the first Tarzon drop in combat took place on December 14, 1950.|$|E
5|$|The Scilly Isles were {{supporters}} of Charles I {{during the civil}} war, and after a short period in Parliamentary control rebelled in favour of Charles in 1648. Tresco formed a base for Royalists privateers and Parliament became concerned that the Dutch, then hostile to England, might counter the piracy by occupying the islands, gaining a foothold they could then <b>use</b> <b>against</b> England. In 1651 Parliament sent Sir Robert Blake {{in charge of a}} naval task force to retake the islands.|$|E

5|$|The {{armament}} of the Montana-class battleships {{would have}} been similar to the preceding Iowa-class battleships, but {{with an increase in}} the number of primary guns and more potent secondary guns for <b>use</b> <b>against</b> enemy surface ships and aircraft. Had they been completed, the Montanas {{would have been}} gun-for-gun the most powerful battleships the United States had constructed, and the only US battleship class that would have come close to equaling the Imperial Japanese Navy battleships Yamato and Musashi in armament, armor, and displacement.|$|E
5|$|Their {{secondary}} armament comprised a dozen quick-firing (QF) 3-inch 20 cwt guns. Eight {{of these}} were on low-angle mounts intended for <b>use</b> <b>against</b> torpedo boats and the remaining four were on high-angle mounts for anti-aircraft defence. They also mounted two submerged tubes, one on each broadside, and four above-water tubes, two on each broadside, for 21-inch torpedoes.|$|E

5|$|Both {{countries}} faced {{difficulty in}} financing their own dreadnoughts. Although in Argentina the ruling National Autonomist Party supported the purchases, they initially faced public resistance for such expensive acquisitions. An influx of inflammatory newspaper editorials supporting new dreadnoughts, especially from La Prensa, and renewed border disputes, particularly Brazilian assertions that the Argentines {{were attempting to}} restore the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, swayed the public to support the purchases. The Argentine President, José Figueroa Alcorta, attempted to ease the tensions with a message warning the Brazilians of a naval arms race should they continue on their present course. The Brazilian government replied with reasoning similar to Pena's speech in 1906, in that they believed the ships were necessary to replace the antiquated equipment left by the long-term neglect of the Brazilian Navy, and they repeatedly insisted that the ships were not meant for <b>use</b> <b>against</b> Argentina.|$|E
5|$|Fresh {{worries about}} France, {{combined}} {{with the development of}} rifled cannon and iron-clad warships, led to the Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom being established in 1859, and expressing fears about the security of the south coast. In response, Sandgate was re-equipped with heavier guns in 1859, and extensive work was carried out on Southsea. Hurst was fitted with two huge batteries of heavy rifled breech-loading guns, protected by iron armour-plate, intended for <b>use</b> <b>against</b> fast-moving enemy warships. Tilbury Blockhouse was destroyed to make way for heavier guns at the fort after 1868. Portland was readopted by army as a garrison base in 1869 in response to fears of an invasion, but it was not rearmed.|$|E
5|$|In May 1945 an Interim Committee {{was created}} to advise and report on wartime and postwar {{policies}} {{regarding the use of}} nuclear energy. The Interim Committee in turn established a scientific panel consisting of Arthur Compton, Fermi, Lawrence and Oppenheimer to advise it on scientific issues. In its presentation to the Interim Committee the scientific panel offered its opinion not just on the likely physical effects of an atomic bomb, but on its likely military and political impact. This included opinions on such sensitive issues as whether or not the Soviet Union should be advised of the weapon in advance of its <b>use</b> <b>against</b> Japan.|$|E

5|$|It was {{to prove}} this revolutionary {{technology}} that Dreadnought was designed in January 1905, laid down in October 1905 and sped to completion by 1906. She carried ten 12-inch guns, had an 11-inch armor belt, {{and was the first}} large ship powered by turbines. She mounted her guns in five turrets; three on the centerline (one forward, two aft) and two on the wings, giving her at her launch twice the broadside of any other warship. She retained a number of 12-pound (3-inch, 76mm) quick-firing guns for <b>use</b> <b>against</b> destroyers and torpedo-boats. Her armor was heavy enough for her to go head-to-head with any other ship in a gun battle, and conceivably win.|$|E
5|$|Oliver's Battery {{was built}} in the interregnum {{following}} the English Civil War. The Isles of Scilly had supported Charles I during the conflict between 1642 and 1646, and, after a short period in Parliamentary control, the islands rebelled in favour of Charles in 1648. The islands became a base for Royalist privateers, and Parliament became concerned that the Dutch, then hostile to England, might counter the piracy by occupying the islands, gaining a foothold that they could then <b>use</b> <b>against</b> England.

5|$|Oslo Police District has {{a series}} of special {{divisions}} and task forces which provide aid to all other police districts when necessary. It {{is responsible for the}} two police helicopters, which is mostly used for traffic motoring, search and rescue and apprehension. The Emergency Response Unit is a deployment unit for terrorism, sabotage and hostage incidents, which is separate from the crisis and hostage negotiation service. Oslo's dog patrol service includes the national bomb squad. The departments further has a mobile deployment squad against demonstrations and riots, a Police Negotiation Unit for <b>use</b> <b>against</b> barricades and kidnapping, a mounted police, and the responsibility for protecting high-ranking government and royal officials.|$|E

5|$|Portland Castle is an {{artillery}} fort constructed by Henry VIII on the Isle of Portland, Dorset, between 1539 and 1541. It formed {{part of the}} King's Device programme to protect against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire, and defended the Portland Roads anchorage. The fan-shaped castle was built from Portland stone, with a curved central tower and a gun battery, flanked by two angular wings. Shortly after its construction it was armed with eleven artillery pieces, intended for <b>use</b> <b>against</b> enemy shipping, operating in partnership with its sister castle of Sandsfoot {{on the other side}} of the anchorage. During the English Civil War, Portland was taken by the Royalist supporters of King Charles I, and then survived two sieges before finally surrendering to Parliament in 1646.|$|E
5|$|The 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, {{of which}} Britain was a signatory, did not ban {{submarines}} {{but it did}} ban their <b>use</b> <b>against</b> merchant ships, which was X1s unacknowledged purpose; its armament had been designed to successfully engage the classes of vessels likely to be escorting convoys, such as destroyers and frigates. Therefore, {{a certain amount of}} secrecy surrounded X1, the government even going to the lengths of taking a national newspaper to court over its pictures of the new submarine following her launch, all copies of the paper being seized.|$|E
5|$|The RAAF's Hornets {{have been}} fitted with several {{different}} types of air-to-air weapons. The aircraft are equipped with an internal M61A1 cannon for <b>use</b> <b>against</b> air and ground targets; 578 rounds can be carried for this weapon. During the initial years of the Hornet's service, the aircraft were equipped with AIM-9M Sidewinder short range air-to-air missiles and AIM-7M Sparrow medium-range air-to-air missiles. The Sparrows were replaced by the AIM-120 AMRAAM in 2002, and in 2004 the Sidewinders were replaced by ASRAAMs. The older missiles are occasionally used in training exercises, however.|$|E
