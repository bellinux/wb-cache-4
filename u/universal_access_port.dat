50|$|As <b>universal</b> <b>access</b> {{continues}} to {{be incorporated into the}} U.S. education system, professors and instructors at the college level are required (in some instances by law) to rethink methods of facilitating <b>universal</b> <b>access</b> in their classrooms. <b>Universal</b> <b>access</b> to college education may involve the provision of a variety of different assessment methods of learning and retention. For example, in order to determine how much of the material was learned, a professor may enlist multiple methods of assessment. Methods of assessment may include a comprehensive exam, unit exams, portfolios, research papers, literature reviews, an oral exam or homework assignments. Providing a variety of ways to assess the extent of learning and retention will not only identify the gaps in <b>universal</b> <b>access</b> but may also elucidate the ways to improve <b>universal</b> <b>access.</b>|$|R

40|$|Universal {{service is}} governed by a {{regulatory}} framework that guarantees nationwide access to basic telephone service over the {{public switched telephone network}} (PSTN). The ongoing network migration to IP networks, however, poses the question of how the existing framework would accommodate this change. Taking the case of Japan, this paper presents an overview of Japan's universal service system under the network migration and argues the importance of assessing consumer preference for universal service in adapting the system to this new environment. After describing the existing system including the universal service fund and the impacts of the transition to IP networks, the government's responses to cope with the change are reviewed. A system of <b>universal</b> <b>access</b> is proposed which is designed to ensure access rather than a specific service. To realize a new regulatory framework for <b>universal</b> <b>access,</b> studies will be necessary on issues such as the scope of <b>universal</b> <b>access</b> and ensuring sufficient compensation. Emphasizing the importance to evaluate consumer preference or willingness-to-pay for <b>universal</b> <b>access,</b> an empirical analysis in an experimental framework is conducted, which examines whether consumers are willing to accept the additional burden of sustaining <b>universal</b> <b>access</b> if they are well informed about the issue. Finally, challenges for future studies on <b>universal</b> <b>access</b> are referred. <b>Universal</b> service PSTN IP networks Network migration Universal service fund <b>Universal</b> <b>access</b> Willingness-to-pay Japan...|$|R

However, public transportation, and programs like <b>Universal</b> <b>Access</b> that promote public transportation by providing ‘fare free’ access to specific groups in the community, can offer low cost, sustainable alternatives to car-based transportation. The basic concept behind <b>Universal</b> <b>Access</b> is that a community group contracts with the local public transit system to provide unlimited access to public transportation for individuals within the group at a negotiated cost to the group (Toor et. al 2004). The {{purpose of this study}} is to determine the feasibility of creating a <b>Universal</b> <b>Access</b> program for one college campus, Illinois Wesleyan University (IWU).

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the topic of}} <b>Universal</b> <b>Access</b> [...] specifically <b>Universal</b> <b>Access</b> to telecommunications in rural areas of developing countries [...] from the policy perspectives of telecommunication policy reform and of complementary <b>Universal</b> <b>Access</b> public subsidy mechanisms. Starting with broad lessons learned on competition in telecommunications, the report will narrow in onto the specific mechanism of minimum-subsidy auctions for <b>Universal</b> <b>Access</b> to telecommunications. First of all, how does competition in telecommunications affect Universal Access/Service? What roles does competition play on technological innovations such as Internet or mobile? And what regulatory safeguards have been or are necessary to enable competition and to promote Universal Access/Service? We will first analyse the experiences of OECD countries that started reforming their telecommunication markets early on, to gather insight into the process and impact of telecommunication reform. We will also review complementary mechanisms that OECD countries have set up to subsidise <b>Universal</b> <b>Access</b> in the areas unlikely to be covered by market forces alone. We will then review some regulatory measures that can help to provide <b>Universal</b> <b>Access</b> to the rural areas of developing countries without subsidies, and we will discuss some cost-effective ways for developing countries to provide incentives to markets to expand telecommunication infrastructure to poor rural areas, before making use of subsidies [...] . ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} {{the contribution of}} adaptive techniques to <b>Universal</b> <b>Access</b> in Human^Computer Interaction. To this effect, the paper revisits the concept of <b>Universal</b> <b>Access,</b> brie£y reviews relevant work on adaptive techniques, and follows their application in efforts to provide accessibility of interactive systems, from the early, product- and environment-level adaptation-based approaches, to more generic solutions oriented towards <b>Universal</b> <b>Access.</b> Finally, the paper highlights {{some of the research}} challenges ahead. The normative perspective of the paper is that adaptive techniques in the context of <b>Universal</b> <b>Access</b> have the potential to facilitate both accessibility and high quality interaction, for the broadest possible end-user population. This implies the design of systems that undertake context-sensitive processing so as to manifest their functional core in alternative interactive embodiments suitable for different users, usage patterns and contexts of use. Such a capability needs to be built into the system from the early phases of conception and design, and subsequently validated throughout its life cycle.

40|$|In South Africa (SA) <b>universal</b> <b>access</b> to {{treatment}} for HIV-infected individuals in need {{has yet to}} be achieved. Currently ~ 1 million receive treatment, but an additional 1. 6 million are in need. It is being debated whether to use a universal 'test and treat' (T&T) strategy to try to eliminate HIV in SA; treatment reduces infectivity and hence transmission. Under a T&T strategy all HIV-infected individuals would receive treatment whether in need or not. This would require treating 5 million individuals almost immediately and providing treatment for several decades. We use a validated mathematical model to predict impact and costs of: (i) a universal T&T strategy and (ii) achieving <b>universal</b> <b>access</b> {{to treatment}}. Using modeling the WHO has predicted a universal T&T strategy in SA would eliminate HIV within a decade, and (after 40 years) cost ~$ 10 billion less than achieving <b>universal</b> <b>access.</b> In contrast, we predict a universal T&T strategy in SA could eliminate HIV, but take 40 years and cost ~$ 12 billion more than achieving <b>universal</b> <b>access.</b> We determine the difference in predictions is because the WHO has under-estimated survival time on treatment and ignored the risk of resistance. We predict, after 20 years, ~ 2 million individuals would need second-line regimens if a universal T&T strategy is implemented versus ~ 1. 5 million if <b>universal</b> <b>access</b> is achieved. Costs need to be realistically estimated and multiple evaluation criteria used to compare 'treatment as prevention' with other prevention strategies. Before implementing a universal T&T strategy, which may not be sustainable, we recommend striving to achieve <b>universal</b> <b>access</b> to treatment as quickly as possible. We predict achieving <b>universal</b> <b>access</b> to treatment would be a very effective 'treatment as prevention' approach and bring the HIV epidemic in SA close to elimination, preventing ~ 4 million infections after 20 years and ~ 11 million after 40 years...|$|R
