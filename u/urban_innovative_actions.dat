40|$|Several {{empirical}} {{works have}} shown the robust and positive relation between growth and innovation at macroeconomic level and between firm economic performance and innovation at microeconomic level. However, the economists have had less opportunities to study such linkages during severe global downturns of the economic cycle. Moreover, the present disruptive economic downturn has forced the firms to implement survival strategies. One of such strategic behaviour regards the way of intervention on product and process areas through <b>innovative</b> <b>actions.</b> Focusing the attention on the micro level, the present work provides an empirical analysis {{on the basis of}} more than 500 Italian manufacturing firms located in Emilia-Romagna region, with the aim of disentangling the relations between pre-crisis innovation strategies and firm economic performance during the crisis as well as the linkages between the <b>innovative</b> <b>actions</b> taken to react to the recession’s challenges and the economic performance in the recession. The results suggest the existence of strong relationships between past innovative activities and the capacity to react to the challenges brought by the crisis through <b>innovative</b> <b>actions</b> along product, process and organization/HRM dimensions, although the role of complementarities among past innovative activities doe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{productivity}} enhancing {{capability of}} cities is widely noted. Yet, while <b>urban</b> <b>innovative</b> capacity is often assumed to arise {{due to the}} close proximity of diverse elements within cities, little empirical research has attempted to associate population density with urban innovation. Thus, this research investigates how the density of a specific class of workers, the “creative class”, affects metropolitan innovation. It builds upon, extends, but in important ways departs from studies linking innovation to geographically mediated knowledge spillovers. Multivariate analyses suggest that density and creativity separately and jointly affect innovation in metropolitan areas. Keywords...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{regional}} economies to withstand competition and to manage change {{is related to}} their capacity to innovate. The increasing importance of knowledge in determining economic performance places innovation high on the regional development agenda. The Regional Programmes of <b>Innovative</b> <b>Actions</b> {{are seen as a}} catalyst which gives regions an opportunity to try more adventurous actions that are often otherwise postponed or ignored. It is particularly important for the least-developed regions, such as, among others, the thirteen Greek regions, that they have the chance to experiment in fields outside the norm of their structural funds programmes and develop greater co-operation and networking with more developed regions. The second publication of the Greek Regional Programmes of <b>Innovative</b> <b>Actions,</b> entitled Regional Innovation Excellence in Greece, deals thoroughly with the programmes themselves, notably by presenting a comprehensive inventory of each individual action as well as attempting to produce their first clustering categorisation. Clusters represent a different way of dividing the regional economy. Cluster policy is a ‘mature’ policy area in some countries, and one that is emerging in others. ...|$|R
