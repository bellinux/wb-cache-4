2500|$|The {{original}} Insight had {{a conventional}} manual transmission. Starting with the 2001 model, a CVT {{variant of the}} Insight was available; the CVT {{is similar to that}} used in the Honda Civic Hybrid and the Honda Logo. A traditional transmission shifts between a fixed set of engine-to-wheel ratios; however, a CVT allows for an infinite set of ratios between its lowest gear and its highest. A feature shared by the two hybrids (and now appearing in others) is the ability to automatically turn off the engine when the vehicle is at a stop (and restart it <b>upon</b> <b>movement).</b> Since it is more powerful than most starters of conventional cars, the Insight's electric motor can start the engine nearly instantaneously. The Integrated Motor Assist is run by an [...] "Intelligent Power Unit (IPU)", a desktop computer-sized box. The Intelligent Power Unit, the Power control Unit, the Electronic Control Unit, the vehicle's batteries, dc-to-dc converter and a high-voltage inverter are all located under the cargo floor of the vehicle, behind the seats.|$|E

50|$|Fixed {{contacts}} are inexpensive but {{prone to}} loss of electrical connection. Combination of fixed and flexible contacts are a better solution, {{but this is}} subject to an open circuit <b>upon</b> <b>movement</b> in the direction away from the fixed position; the spring contact compresses and allows the battery {{to move away from}} the fixed contact. A flexible contact allows for slight expansion of the cell on discharge, as internal chemicals increase in volume. Flexible contacts with multiple fingers touching the anode and cathode allow for movement in multiple directions without losing electrical connection.|$|E

When the target is destroyed, the beam will fire straight again until the next target is locked. Collecting power-ups will increase the width and the power of the beam like Laser.|$|E

A drive wheel is mounted on a drive shaft and arranged to be positioned in rolling engagement with the elongated guide carrying the vehicle. A brake member is arranged on the drive shaft for movement {{into and out of}} engagement with an adjacent surface of the drive wheel. An actuator is mounted on the body to be manually moved back and forth between spaced positions in an arc of movement. A ratchet-and-pawl mechanism is arranged to operate <b>upon</b> <b>movements</b> of the actuator in one direction between first and second positions for coupling the actuator to the drive wheel to incrementally rotate the wheel in one rotational direction and to operate <b>upon</b> <b>movements</b> of the actuator in the opposite direction for uncoupling the actuator from the wheel. The brake member is threadedly coupled to the drive shaft in order that the brake member will be operated only when the actuator is moved on beyond its first and second positions for shifting the brake member along the drive shaft and into frictional engagement with the adjacent surface on the drive wheel...|$|R

5000|$|Lock {{products}} are theoretically valued at zero {{at the time}} of execution and thus do not typically require an up-front exchange between the parties. Based <b>upon</b> <b>movements</b> in the underlying asset over time, however, the value of the contract will fluctuate, and the derivative may be either an asset (i.e. [...] "in the money") or a liability (i.e. [...] "out of the money") at different points throughout its life. Importantly, either party is therefore exposed to the credit quality of its counterparty and is interested in protecting itself in an event of default.|$|R
50|$|The {{headquarters}} of the 33d Fighter Wing became operational <b>upon</b> <b>movement</b> to Otis Air Force Base, Massachusetts, in mid-November 1948. The wing trained to maintain tactical proficiency and participated in exercises and aerial demonstrations from November 1948 to November 1949. It assumed an air defense mission in December 1949 and provided air defense in the northeastern United States until inactivated in February 1952, when it was inactivated and most personnel were transferred to the 4707th Air Defense Wing. Once again it provided air defense in the northeastern United States, October 1956 - June 1957, but was non-operational from 1 July 1957 to 18 August 1957.|$|E
50|$|Viewpoints is a {{technique}} of composition {{that acts as a}} medium for thinking about and acting <b>upon</b> <b>movement,</b> gesture and creative space. Originally developed in the 1970s by choreographer Mary Overlie as a method of movement improvisation, The Viewpoints theory was adapted for stage acting by directors Anne Bogart and Tina Landau.Bogart and Overlie were on the faculty of ETW at NYU in the late 1970s and early 1980s during which time Bogart was influenced by Overlie's innovations. Overlie's Six Viewpoints (space, story, time, emotion, movement, and shape) are considered to be a logical way to examine, analyze and create dances, while Bogart's Viewpoints are considered practical in creating staging with actors.|$|E
5000|$|The right arm, hand, and bow are {{responsible}} for tone quality, rhythm, dynamics, articulation, and certain (but not all) changes in timbre. The bow is held in the right hand with the thumb bent underneath the frog to support it and the other fingers loosely touching the wood. The middle and ring fingers are usually wrapped around the frog, although in some cases (such as in baroque performance practice) the whole hand holds the stick above the frog. Holding the little finger curved and resting on the near facet of the octagonal shape of the stick, next to the facet {{on top of the}} stick, allows that finger to [...] "unweight" [...] the bow, using the thumb as a fulcrum. Bowing action should be initiated and solely dependent <b>upon</b> <b>movement</b> of the right hand, not by the forearm, upper arm, and shoulder. Flexion and extension of these parts should be passive led by right hand action. Otherwise, subtle and delicate bowing control is impossible, leading to excessive tension in the right arm, making bow control difficult.|$|E

40|$|Patients {{frequently}} experience {{postoperative pain}} after a total knee arthroplasty; such pain is always challenging to treat and may delay the patient&# 8217;s recovery. It {{is unclear whether}} local infiltration or a femoral nerve block offers a better analgesic effect after total knee arthroplasty. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to compare local infiltration with a femoral nerve block in patients who underwent a primary unilateral total knee arthroplasty. We searched Pubmed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library through December 2014. Two reviewers scanned abstracts and extracted data. The data collected included numeric rating scale values for pain at rest and pain <b>upon</b> <b>movement</b> and opioid consumption in the first 24 hours. Mean differences with 95 % confidence intervals were calculated for each end point. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate potential sources of heterogeneity. While the numeric rating scale values for pain <b>upon</b> <b>movement</b> (MD- 0. 62; 95 %CI: - 1. 13 to - 0. 12; p= 0. 02) in the first 24 hours differed significantly between the patients who received local infiltration and those who received a femoral nerve block, {{there were no differences}} in the numeric rating scale results for pain at rest (MD- 0. 42; 95 %CI:- 1. 32 to 0. 47; p= 0. 35) or opioid consumption (MD 2. 92; 95 %CI:- 1. 32 to 7. 16; p= 0. 18) in the first 24 hours.
