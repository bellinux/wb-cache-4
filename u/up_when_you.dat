[...] Vicki Lutas had a mostly negative review for the song saying [...] "at {{the end of the}} day it does sound like something you could have made <b>up</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> were at school", though she did praise the backing track for being [...] "dark, eerie and cold in a chilling way; in an infectious way". However she pointed out that [...] "the vocal arrangement and the actual vocals themselves do nothing more for the song", and respected that [...] "it's a brave song choice, but it's hap-hazard vocal line seems to scream... C-R-I-N-G-E.".|$|E
500|$|In July 2015, Slant Magazine Julia Pressman {{describes}} the [...] "Tobacco" [...] segment {{in her article}} [...] "The British Dude Who Is Winning America's War on Bullshit", in which she features five ways Oliver [...] "has owned 2015 thus far". The website Inverse included the February 15 segment, the second most effective from the show's second season, saying it [...] "may be the most lasting of the entire year". Furthermore, the website's Matthew Strauss wrote, [...] "Jeff shows <b>up</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> Google Image-search 'Marlboro'; he's on bus stops in Uruguay; and he's on t-shirts in Togo. Jeff is an icon. Oliver hasn't taken down Big Tobacco, but he sure didn't make them look too good." [...] In August, the Los Angeles Times named Oliver, and costume designer Mikaela Wohl, winners in the [...] "Costume designer's quietest cry for help" [...] category for the paper's 2015 Envy Awards, a parody of the annual Emmy Awards. Randee Dawn complimented both for their hard work and humor, but said Wohl's work on [...] "amazing" [...] costumes like Jeff and Russian Space Sex Gecko distracted her from using her [...] "creative energies" [...] for dressing Oliver.|$|E
500|$|Like most {{episodes of}} Parks and Recreation, {{a great deal}} of the scenes in [...] "Rock Show" [...] were improvised by the actors. Paul Schneider made up his own {{dialogue}} during the scene in which he and Poehler sit next to the pit and he talks about it as if it is already a park. Poehler's laughter at his jokes in this scene is her genuine reaction. Pratt also improvised much of his own dialogue, including his rationale to Ann for why he lied about his leg casts: [...] "I really, really like it when you serve me food." [...] Pratt also changed the reaction his character had to Mark falling into the pit. The script originally called for Andy to be serious and concerned, but Pratt changed it so his character thought the fall was funny. Pratt also improvised the songs he sang during an early scene in the episode, in which Andy makes up songs about random items in Ann's living room out of boredom from wearing the casts for so long. One of the songs he sings is about a lamp, and included the lyrics, [...] "I wish you were a lamp that would light <b>up</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> get touched." [...] Pratt thought of the song because he had recently gotten such a lamp as a gift from a friend.|$|E

2500|$|Dupont and Vedel {{returned}} to Paris in disgrace and were duly court-martialed, deprived of rank and title, and imprisoned at Fort de Joux for {{their role in}} the disaster. (Dupont was not paroled until the restoration of Louis XVIII; indeed, rumours persisted that he had been quietly assassinated in captivity.) None of the commanding officers, however slight their share of the responsibility, escaped without retribution: Napoleon held that his army in Spain had been [...] "commanded by postal inspectors rather than generals." [...] In January 1809, the Emperor halted a parade in Valladolid when he recognized Dupont's chief of staff among the commanders, scolding the unfortunate officer {{in full view of the}} troops and ordering him off the square. According to General Foy, Napoleon began his tirade: [...] "What, general! did not your hand wither <b>up</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> signed that infamous capitulation?" [...] Years later, Napoleon opened an inquiry into the Convention of Andujar under the mandate of the Imperial High Court, in camera, which turned out yet another proclamation against Dupont. An Imperial decree dated May 1, 1812, prohibited any field commander to treat for capitulation and declared every unauthorized surrender a criminal act punishable by death.|$|E
