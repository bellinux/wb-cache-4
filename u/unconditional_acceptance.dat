5|$|President Antanas Smetona's <b>unconditional</b> <b>acceptance</b> of {{a second}} {{ultimatum}} {{in the space of}} a little over one year became a major source of dissatisfaction with his authoritarian rule. The German ultimatum triggered a political crisis: the passive cabinet of Vladas Mironas was replaced by a cabinet headed by General Jonas Černius. For the first time since the 1926 coup d'état, the government included members of the opposition: Leonas Bistras, of the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party, was named Minister of Education and Jurgis Krikščiūnas, of the Lithuanian Popular Peasants' Union, was named Minister of Agriculture. Because other parties were banned, Bistras and Krikščiūnas were officially billed as independent private citizens. Four generals were now members of the cabinet as well. However, even the looming international crisis did not induce Lithuanian politicians to unite, and they continued to engage in petty political disputes.|$|E

500|$|The {{acceptance}} {{triggered a}} government crisis in Lithuania: on March 24, Prime Minister Juozas Tūbelis, who held uncompromising positions over Vilnius {{and at the}} time of the ultimatum was undergoing medical treatment in Switzerland, stepped down. His successor, Vladas Mironas, who was in favor of normalizing relations with Poland, assembled a new cabinet of ministers. Despite increasing pressure to form a broader coalition, the new cabinet was composed solely of members of the Lithuanian Nationalists Union. The <b>unconditional</b> <b>acceptance</b> hurt Lithuanian pride and damaged the reputation of the party. The suppressed opposition used this damage as an opportunity to renew its activities and formed a group called Ašis (Axis). In Poland the acceptance was greeted with enthusiasm, described as a [...] "great bloodless victory", and celebrated by a military march in Vilnius.|$|E

500|$|Most critics {{feel that}} Baxter is {{presented}} well in Mom & Me & Mom. [...] Candace Smith, who reviews the audio {{version of the}} book, states that Angelou celebrates the <b>unconditional</b> <b>acceptance</b> and support of her mother, who comes across [...] "as a street-smart, caring woman who shaped the author's life and legacy by her words and example". [...] Vanessa Bush of Booklist calls the book a [...] "loving recollection of a complicated relationship" [...] and a [...] "remarkable and deeply revealing chronicle of love and healing". [...] Russo states that the book is [...] "a beautiful tribute to Baxter's independent, vibrant, and courageous spirit". [...] Evaristo disagrees, and states that Baxter comes across as [...] "less rounded, less interesting, more sanctified and less credible" [...] than Angelou describes her elsewhere. [...] Sturges calls the book [...] "a profoundly moving tale of separation and reunion, and an ultimately optimistic portrait of the maternal bond". [...] The most interesting part of the book, according to Sturges, is [...] "Angelou's casual overturning {{of the idea of}} the mother who abandons her children as monstrous and inhumane". [...] Sturges also says that Baxter is presented as unapologetic, charismatic, independent, and resilient, traits that [...] "have seemingly been passed on to her daughter". [...] Reviewer Valerie Sayers insists that the scenes that depict Angelou's [...] "halting steps" [...] towards her forgiveness and acceptance of her mother are {{among the best in the}} book. [...] Sayers labels Mom & Me & Mom [...] "an account of forgiveness", and like Angelou and Baxter, [...] "just revealing enough, and pretty irresistible". [...] Like her mother expected from her, Angelou expects her readers to move past their resentments and [...] "whatever was unbearable". [...] Sayers also calls both Baxter and Angelou [...] "a Large Dramatic Presence", and says that Angelou matches her mother's spirit.|$|E

Once this separation is achieved, then students may be prepared for critical re-entry into an examination of everyday life. In a classroom environment that achieves such liberating intent, one of the potential outcomes is that the students themselves assume more responsibility for the class.

40|$|In this article, we {{communicate}} transformative findings from {{a case study}} on the resilience {{of a young woman}} with fragile X syndrome (FXS), a genetic condition involving mental impairment and physical, emotional, and behavioral challenges. We explored the resilience of “Lucy,” a spirited 16 -year-old North American, using informal interviews with her, formal interviews with significant adults in her life, and observations (visual and anecdotal) over 20 months. In reporting the information-rich case of Lucy, well supported by her ecology to rise above full-mutation FXS, we encourage a positive perspective of living with FXS. Although we recognize the limitations of a single case study, our findings offer tentative, process-oriented insights into resilience in contexts of genetic disability, previously unreported in conjunction with FXS. We concluded that the processes informing Lucy’s resilience were partly her responsibility and partly her social ecology’s, and comprised intrapersonal agency, <b>unconditional</b> positive <b>acceptance</b> and belonging, and support toward mastery.

40|$|We {{provide a}} {{theoretical}} foundation for analyzing how social stigma and adopted behavioral traits affect {{the transmission of}} HIV across a population. We combine an evolutionary game-theoretic model—based on a relationship signaling stage game—with the SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model of disease transmission. Our evolutionary model specifies how two types of social stigma—that which accompanies an HIV+ condition and that which follows associating with an HIV+ partner—influence behavioral propensities to honestly report one’s condition (or not) and to unconditionally accept relationships (or not). With respect to reporting an HIV+ condition, we find that condition stigma impedes the fitness of honest reporting, whereas association stigma impedes the relative fitness of concealing an HIV+ condition; and both propensities can coexist in a polymorphic equilibrium. By linking our model to the SIR model, we find that condition stigma unambiguously enhances disease transmission by discouraging both honest reporting and a society’s acceptance of AIDS education, whereas association stigma has an ambiguous impact: on one hand it can impede HIV transmission by discouraging concealing behavior and <b>unconditional</b> relationship <b>acceptance,</b> but it also compromises a society’s acceptance of AIDS education. Our relatively simple evolutionary/SIR model offers a foundation for numerous theoretical extensions—such as applications to social network theory—as well as foundation for many testable empirical hypotheses...|$|R

Of Japanese Animation expresses the view that Kaworu's offer of love for Shinji is a tactic that Kaworu as the last Angel used to disarm Shinji. In 1998 reviewer Kenneth Lee criticized Kaworu, saying: [...] "...the element of homosexuality {{is perhaps the most}} disturbing, gratuitous, and unnecessary aspect that presents itself in episode 24...Ultimately, the homosexuality issue seems nothing more than cheap shock value tactics to stun generation X"; he considered the entire Shinji-Kaworu relationship [...] "ludicrous and pathetically humorous". Gainax is clearly aware that the audience associates Kaworu with bishōnen tropes, and have produced artworks such as splash pages for their website in reference to Kaworu's ambiguity and the audience's reaction to the character. However, some believe that whether Kaworu, an Angel, actually has any concept of sexuality as he is presented in the series is unclear.

40|$|Inmy {{bachelor}} I {{focus on}} client-oriented approach {{in social work}} with clients with mental disabilities. In addition to theoretical knowledge I mapthe use and the knowledge of this approach by social workers in the South BohemianRegion and the South Moravian Region. The aim and purpose of the thesis was to inform public, students of social work and students of related fields of study about the possibilities of approaches {{that are used to}} clients with mental disabilities in social services. The aim of practical part was to describe an approach focused on the client and its use within work with clients with mental disabilities in organizations providing social services. To determine this goal there were defined two research questions: 1) In what extent do social workers use the client-orientedapproach to individuals with mental disabilities in organizations providing social services in the South Bohemian and South Moravian Region? 2) What are the main characteristics of the client-oriented approach to the use for work with clients with mental disabilities? In the thesis I focused on the understanding and the application of the approach used by social workers in the South Moravian and the South Bohemian Region. The research used a qualitative research strategy, using methods of questioning techniques and semi-structured interview. The sample consisted of six social workers from the organizations of the South Bohemian Region and seven social workers of the South Moravian Region that work with people with mental disabilities. Of the organizations were, I always chose only one social worker from the organization. Collected data were analysed by the method of clustering. The results showed that social workers used the client-oriented approach with the working with people with mental disabilities only in unique cases. It was revealed that a total of ten informants applied in their work with clients some theoretical approach of social work. However, only three communication partners based on client-oriented approach and these three were from the South Bohemian Region. From the testimony I noticed thatinformants from the South Bohemian Regionare better informed of the theoretical approach oriented. In the second region - South Moravian Region, social workers rather based on the experience with the target group of mentally handicapped people than from any theoretical approach. I also focused on mapping information about the approaches of Carl Rogers, primarily client-oriented approach informants who don't use approaches of Carl Rogers were interviewed. Eight out of eight surveyed knew the name of Carl Rogers and his approach focused on client or they have ever heard about it. Then I investigated whether the informants are familiar with important concepts of the approach. I mapped that eight out of eight informants are familiar with empathy and use it in their work. However, congruence is known only by one out of eight respondents and this informant was from South Bohemian Region, who does not use it in practice. <b>Unconditional</b> positive <b>acceptance</b> was known for all eleven respondents, three out of seven from the South Moravian Region and four out of four from the South Bohemian region applied it in their practice. This bachelor thesis can be used as information material for the general public and students of social work and related fields of study. Approach focused on client is known but only little used within the working with people with mental disabilities in social services, so this work can be also used as an initiative serving the greater interest of future social workers on this approach...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an attempt to {{contribute}} a fresh perspective on marriage and related subjects, making use of public theology in dialogue with the Christ narrative. The phenomena of post secularism, postmodernism and film hermeneutics are explored. Critical hermeneutics are used as a point of departure. This study aims {{to bridge the gap between}} the Christ narrative and public theology as it surfaces in the cinema. In Chapter 2 the terms of the concepts public theology and posttheism are investigated. Public theology is understood as the contribution of people in the public sphere participating in “God-talk”, as an exponent of post theism. Chapter 3 investigates the historical development of marriage. This investigation shows that social-political and philosophical influences caused different forms and models of marriage to evolve. It becomes clear that it is practically impossible to define one specific form of marriage that dominated history. Chapter 4 is divided into two parts. The first part explores New Testament texts related to the themes of marriage and relationships. It is shown that these New Testament texts are part of a broader context and therefore cannot be applied directly to marriage in modern times. On the other hand the Christ narrative, seen as an ancient biography, does outline important values applicable to marriage, intimacy and sexuality. These values were identified and are used in following chapters to define intimate relationships. The investigation of biblical models in the second part of this chapter shows that biblical models of marriage were also rooted within a historical situation. Certain values that are found within these models can still serve as guidelines for relationships, while others are influenced by an androcentric background. Chapter 5 is a theoretical investigation using Gerhard Ebelings’ “new hermeneutics” as model, applied to the field of the public theology of film. From a hermeneutical perspective recent films with biblical themes are important to communicate the gospel and morals in our times as the postmodern generation is primarily influenced by visual media. In Chapter 6 three films are discussed as examples of film hermeneutics and public theology: Roepman, As it is in heaven and Les misérables. Similarities with the Christ narrative surfaced, for instance: critique is expressed against destructive ideologies; selfless acts are commendable and <b>unconditional</b> love and <b>acceptance,</b> forgiveness, faith and hope are essential for an authentic existence. These films do not focus on ethical dogmas about marriage, intimacy and sexuality, although some ethical values can be derived. In the concluding chapter a bifocal melting of horizons, based on the findings of the research, are described. Both the public theology of film hermeneutics and the Sache Jesu highlight the importance of the inner values that constitute a meaningful relationship. The study argues that the church should reconsider their traditional view on marriage and sexual relationships by emphasizing the values found in the Sache Jesu instead of concentrating on enforcing the outward form of wedlock. In doing so, the church will help postmodern and postsecular people to again understand the meaning of a loving relationship in the presence of God.
