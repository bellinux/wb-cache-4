40|$|It is {{well known}} that second-generation current {{conveyors}} (CCII) are widely used for the realization of second-order current-mode <b>universal</b> <b>filters.</b> A filter with high-quality factor (Q) and gain constant (K) suffers from various signal swing restrictions especially at its angular resonance frequency (coo). This is due to the terminal voltages of the CCIls limited by the power supply voltages and maximum allowable terminal currents of the CCIls. In this paper, signal limitations of the CCII-based current-mode filters are investigated in detail.
