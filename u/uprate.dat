25|$|Many {{existing}} hydroelectric dams {{are fairly}} old (for example, the Hoover Dam {{was built in}} the 1930s), and their original design predated the newer intermittent power sources such as wind and solar by decades. A hydroelectric dam originally built to provide baseload power will have its generators sized according to the average flow of water into the reservoir. Uprating such a dam with additional generators increases its peak power output capacity, thereby increasing its capacity to operate as a virtual grid energy storage unit. The United States Bureau of Reclamation reports an investment cost of $69 per kilowatt capacity to <b>uprate</b> an existing dam, compared to more than $400 per kilowatt for oil-fired peaking generators. While an uprated hydroelectric dam does not directly store excess energy from other generating units, it behaves equivalently by accumulating its own fuel – incoming river water – during periods of high output from other generating units. Functioning as a virtual grid storage unit in this way, the uprated dam {{is one of the most}} efficient forms of energy storage, because it has no pumping losses to fill its reservoir, only increased losses to evaporation and leakage.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, <b>uprating</b> of {{existing}} {{overhead power line}} has become a popular option for electric utilities to address increasing demand for power. <b>Uprating</b> overhead line by increasing voltage allows considerable increase in power transfer capability. This paper initially examines technical issues and conventional methods of <b>uprating</b> the voltage of overhead transmission lines. It then considers a case {{of existing}} 275 kV line in L 3 tower to analyse these issues and propose appropriate process for its possible <b>uprating</b> to 400 kV system. In this case, phase-to-earth clearance {{was found to be}} a key issue for voltage <b>uprating.</b> Application of line surge arresters along the line was proposed for controlling overvoltage thereby reducing the minimum required clearance for 400 kV syste...|$|R

5000|$|General Electric built ten <b>uprated</b> U25Cs in 1965. Facing the {{competitive}} {{pressure of the}} second generation horsepower race GE built these units with increased horsepower. The Alco C628 had more horsepower and the Alco C630 was already announced that Summer. General Motors had the EMD SD40 demonstrators working on several railroads. The increase in unit horsepower was happening that year. The <b>uprated</b> units were built for three railroads that were already operating the U25C. The first <b>uprated</b> units were built for the Northern Pacific between May and July 1965. These were NP #2518-2520 and were rated at 2750 horsepower. Three more <b>uprated</b> U25Cs were built as Atlantic Coast Line #3011-3013 in December 1965. The ACL units were rated at 2800 horsepower.
