40|$|AbstractScientific and {{technical}} progress {{resulted in a}} rapid pace of development and transformation of many resources and inhabited areas which afterwards have an adverse impact on people themselves. The issue of the necessity for a sustainable development of the urban structure is very important today. <b>Urban</b> <b>safety</b> development is necessary to ensure a sustainable development of <b>urban</b> environment. <b>Urban</b> <b>safety</b> is a built environment which ensures safe life of the population {{on the basis of}} a combination of factors. The article contains a theoretical analysis of the classification of factors forming <b>urban</b> <b>safety</b> of an inhabited area. All factors forming the local <b>urban</b> <b>safety</b> are divided into groups: natural, architectural, social, environmental, technogenic, infrastructural and urban. One registers the influence of these factors on environment and population. Primarily, adverse factors forming <b>urban</b> <b>safety</b> of an area affect the human health. Many environmental factors notably have an impact on the man in a certain period of time as they tend to accumulate in the human body. Apart from the influence on the man, one can notice certain influence on animals and plants affected by a complex of adverse factors inherent in urban environment. The conducted <b>urban</b> <b>safety</b> factor analysis allows one to assess the level of liveability and safety of an inhabited area. The article contains the methods of <b>urban</b> <b>safety</b> development. These methods should be worked out and introduced on the local and regional levels...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In Japan, it is {{important}} to carry out urban planning considering natural disasters, because earthquakes occur frequently. However, except for few cases, cities in Japan have not been designed with any definite visions for <b>urban</b> <b>safety</b> based on previous research concerning natural disasters. It is necessary for the people in Japan to propose a future vision of a city from the <b>urban</b> <b>safety</b> point of view, as it has been plagued with many earthquakes throughout history. On the other hand, recent information technology enabled the improvement of real-time monitoring systems after the 1994 Northridge Earthquake and the 1995 Kobe Earthquake. The authors proposed a method of analyzing and designing a city based on the <b>urban</b> <b>safety</b> point of view in previous papers. This method, named as MUSE (the Method of <b>Urban</b> <b>Safety</b> Analysis and Environmental Design), is based on the theory of The Image of the City by Lynch (1961), and some urban physical elements are defined as parts of an organic system. In this paper the prospect for MUSE and the methodology to realize it are described. The proposed system is related to Information Technologies and we expect that MUSE will be applied to early earthquake damage assessment systems. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{explosive}} {{development of}} urban Shanghai after China's economic reform in 1978 has attracted wide attention. There are {{a plethora of}} studies attempting to capture the fast dynamics in this global city. Looking into the urban dynamics from a public safety perspective, however, eludes the current literature. <b>Urban</b> public <b>safety</b> has become a primary concern of urban sustainability in recent years due to escalated potential loss if <b>urban</b> public <b>safety</b> is severely breached. This is even more so for megacities like Shanghai. Assessing {{the current status of}} <b>urban</b> public <b>safety</b> hence becomes an imperative task for urban sustainability. This research initiates a detailed assessment effort through building a relatively comprehensive set of public safety indicators. Four general aspects of Shanghai's <b>urban</b> public <b>safety</b> are identified, i. e., urban development, urban crime and instability, urban housing and livability, and urban disasters. From officially published data, field survey and interviews, 34 individual indicators are chosen. Principal component analyses are conducted {{for each of the four}} aspects, and a synthetic <b>urban</b> public <b>safety</b> index is derived. The analysis suggests that <b>urban</b> Shanghai's public <b>safety</b> is gradually increasing due primarily to continuous economic success and increased investment in public safety preparation, education, and prevention.

40|$|Twenty years post-apartheid South Africa {{continues}} to face unrelentingly {{high levels of}} violence throughout the country. Despite progressive policies influenced by international best practice and the recognition of violence as a complex social problem requiring holistic solutions, the implementation of integrated prevention policy remains weak. Through the employment of a qualitative research approach, this thesis explores the dynamic and complex interrelations between policies and practice that impact on the realisation of broad-based integrated violence prevention in South Africa. In-depth case study research into the institutional structure and implementation methodologies of an internationally supported integrated prevention initiative, the Violence Prevention through Urban Upgrading (VPUU) Programme, provides the basis on which this thesis discusses the contention that institutional misalignment in South Africa hinders the realisation of broad-based implementation of integrated violence and crime prevention. Extending from a research rationale, which suggests that the true value of this kind of internationally supported pilot programme lies in its ability to be transferred and implemented at scale, this thesis draws on the case study experience in order to conceptualise how broadbased programme transfer may be realised. In answering the primary research question what are the main challenges facing the implementation and transferability of the VPUU programme?, this thesis draws together the difficulties being experienced at national policy and local implementation level in order to provide new insights into what programme transfer constitutes in this context. The application of the theoretical framework that seeks to understand the epistemological complexity of the VPUU programme and the delivery of interventions results in an understanding of how the knowledge derived from the case study may contribute to the realisation of mainstreamed programme transfer in the future. Based on the results of the case study, this thesis shows that dealing with complex problems requires the development of institutions and professionals capable of coping with complexity. Furthermore, the research outcomes highlight the prerequisite for institutional alignment towards a common understanding of <b>urban</b> <b>safety</b> and suggest that a shift in mind-set is required {{in the way in which}} <b>urban</b> <b>safety</b> and crime prevention are conceived. It is argued that in order to realise the implementation of integrated prevention, <b>urban</b> <b>safety</b> needs to be seen not as a stand-alone, complementary development issue but rather as a systemic guide with which all sectors and institutions should proactively concern themselves. This kind of systemic integration is likewise argued to be reliant on the establishment of a common vision of what <b>urban</b> <b>safety</b> and prevention constitute. The core contribution of this research lies in the application of a new means of thinking about the complex interrelations associated with integrated prevention, providing in-depth understanding of the dynamics of delivery across the multiple spheres of intervention. The identification of robust intervention elements within more manageable problem spaces may aid in enabling various government departments to realise improved efficiency in the allocation of finite resources and capacities so as to contribute more effectively to the realisation of <b>urban</b> <b>safety...</b>|$|R

40|$|Contemporary {{cities are}} {{affected}} by several challenges. Rapid urbanisation processes combined with unstable economic conditions, uncontrolled physical development and social exclusion, political instability make difficult the understanding of “security and safety” dynamics, often interconnected {{with a combination of}} factors. A mix of social, economic and physical decay often contribute to create appealing conditions for criminal activities. This paper discusses how <b>urban</b> <b>safety</b> and security dynamics are related with urban planning and its implementation, by drawing insights from an urban area belonging to a Southern Italian city, Reggio Calabria. More in general, it will be emphasized the relationships between urban planning and related implementation and urban security in bligthed neighbourhoods. Evidences from the case study show that the status of decay of the urban environment, often consequence of implementation gaps inurban policies and lack of management capabilities, contribute to enhance the isolation {{from the rest of the}} city.

40|$|The paper aims to {{contribute}} to the debate on <b>urban</b> <b>safety</b> measures in Italy by analysing the effects of mayoral ordinances on matters pertaining to security and public order issued in five cities. First, it examines the evolution of <b>urban</b> <b>safety</b> policies in Italy, placing them within the process of renegotiation of powers between the central government and local authorities. Then, it delineates the main futures of the ordinances’ season, started in 2008 with the decree on “urgent measures for security” and put to an end in 2011 by the ruling of the Constitutional Court. In the central part, the paper presents the main results of an empirical research carried out in Bari, Florence, Milan, Padua, Reggio Calabria. Interviews to institutional actors and civil society representatives reveal that the evaluation of ordinances’ effects is highly dependent from the position of the actors in the policy process. The mayors and the local police consider these instruments very useful to reassure the public and to promptly intervene on security matters. On the contrary, many civil society representatives consider the ordinances to have short-lived effects on perceived security and little impact on objective security. In general, a demand for more ordinary, participated and long-term measures on local safety clearly emerges from the study...|$|R
40|$|The {{contemporary}} {{city is a}} contested {{space and}} its governance {{is the subject of}} complex global economic forces, local interests and political struggles as well {{as a response to the}} changing face of governing alliances in residential and commercial areas, forms of consumption, commercially-generated crime and disorder and cultural expressions of leisure. This article seeks to provide a thematic introduction to the manner in which the regulation of contemporary British cities has been influenced by concerns with tackling anti-social behaviour and promoting civility. It argues that in governing <b>urban</b> <b>safety,</b> the normative governmental agendas that seek to remoralise and cleanse city spaces and promote certain values of appropriate consumer-citizen, often clash with commercially-driven imperatives to (excessive) consumption and the allure of cities, for some, as places of difference that exhibit relaxed normative constraints; most notably in the night-time economy. It argues that the manner in which these forces are played out is conditioned by the interplay between different actors and organisations, as both regulators and regulated, some of whom have assumed new responsibilities in the governance of <b>urban</b> <b>safety.</b> The resultant pressures have produced mixed experiences of the city as a meeting place for loosely connected strangers, as a place of indulgence and as a place of cultural expression...|$|R

They strike without warning and they may result various damages to urban environment and human life. The technology to predict their specific time, location and magnitude has not developed yet. It is possible to reduce the harmful effects of earthquakes and to create urban surroundings resistant to earthquakes by comprehensive projects stated as "risk mitigation activities". Turkey is exposed to earthquake risk due to fact that it is on an active seismic zone and that most of the buildings are not in conformity with earthquake safe design codes. zmir also has high earthquake risk as determined in the content of zmir RADIUS Project that is conducted by United Nations. This thesis is mainly about to ensure <b>safety</b> of <b>urban</b> environment that is expose to earthquake risk. The thesis has three principle purposes: to produce a guide about the projects done for mitigating zmir. s earthquake risk, to explain the strategies, process and methods for <b>urban</b> <b>safety</b> and to develop planning and design principles of earthquake conscious urban design.
