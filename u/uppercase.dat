5|$|Individual {{texts are}} {{conventionally}} known {{by a single}} <b>uppercase</b> letter and a name, such as Tablet C, the Mamari Tablet.

25|$|Most Unicode {{software}} <b>uppercases</b> ı to I and lowercases İ to i, but, unless specifically configured for Turkish, it lowercases I to i and <b>uppercases</b> i to I. Thus <b>uppercasing</b> then lowercasing, or vice versa, {{changes the}} letters.|$|R

Octets represented by any other character must be percent-encoded.|$|E
25|$|Every {{typeface}} is {{a collection}} of glyphs, each of which represents an individual letter, number, punctuation mark, or other symbol. The same glyph may be used for characters from different scripts, e.g. Roman <b>uppercase</b> A looks the same as Cyrillic <b>uppercase</b> А and Greek <b>uppercase</b> alpha. There are typefaces tailored for special applications, such as map-making or astrology and mathematics.|$|E
25|$|Nomenclature {{generally}} {{follows the}} conventions of human nomenclature. Gene symbols generally are italicised, with all letters in <b>uppercase</b> (e.g., NLGN1, for neuroligin1). Protein designations {{are the same as}} the gene symbol, but are not italicised; all letters are in <b>uppercase</b> (NLGN1). mRNAs and cDNAs use the same formatting conventions as the gene symbol.|$|E
5000|$|If the LFN is 8.3 mixed case, the LFN will {{store the}} mixed-case name, while the 8.3 name {{will be an}} <b>uppercased</b> version of it.|$|R

5000|$|Another {{approach}} is to indicate word boundaries using medial capitalization, called [...] "CamelCase", [...] "Pascal case", and many other names, thus rendering [...] "" [...] as either [...] "" [...] or [...] "". This convention is commonly used in Pascal, Java, C#, and Visual Basic. Treatment of acronyms in identifiers (e.g. the [...] "XML" [...] and [...] "HTTP" [...] in [...] ) varies. Some dictate that they be lowercased (e.g. [...] ) to ease typing and readability, whereas others leave them <b>uppercased</b> (e.g. [...] ) for accuracy.|$|R

Some commands also support a command line parameter [...] to automatically assume [...] "Yes" [...] on queries, thereby suppressing such prompts. If, however, the parameter [...] is used to specify the [...] "Yes"/"No" [...] characters (thereby overriding any [...] setting), queries are not suppressed.

25|$|The {{relative}} risks—the rating grades—are usually {{expressed through}} some variation of an alphabetical combination of lower- and <b>uppercase</b> letters, with either {{plus or minus}} signs or numbers added to further fine-tune the rating.|$|E
25|$|Subordinated {{units of}} {{institutions}} {{are written in}} <b>uppercase</b> if they are major divisions (e.g. Földrajzi Társaság ‘Society for Geography’, under the Hungarian Academy of Sciences), not including the personnel department or the warden’s office.|$|E

25|$|If a {{geographical}} name consists of several elements whose relationship {{is marked by}} suffixes or postpositions, these elements are also written separately. The <b>uppercase</b> letter of the beginning element is kept even in an adjectival form.|$|E
25|$|The {{keyboard}} has 90 keys. There is no shift key; <b>uppercase</b> letters have keys {{separate from}} the lowercase letters. The arrangement of letters corresponds roughly to letter frequency, with {{the most frequently used}} letters on the left.|$|E
25|$|Gene {{symbols are}} italicised and all letters are in {{lowercase}} (shh). Protein designations {{are the same}} as the gene symbol, are not italicised; the first letter is in <b>uppercase</b> and the remaining letters are in lowercase (Shh).|$|E

25|$|For this example, <b>uppercase</b> {{letters are}} used to denote ciphertext, {{lowercase}} letters {{are used to}} denote plaintext (or guesses at such), and X~t is used to express a guess that ciphertext letter X represents the plaintext letter t.|$|E
25|$|The {{first group}} is divided again by whether they denote proper names (written in <b>uppercase,</b> e.g. ENSZ < Egyesült Nemzetek Szövetsége ‘United Nations Organization’, note that both {{letters of the}} digraphs SZ are capitalized) or common names (written in lowercase, e.g. vb < végrehajtó bizottság ‘executive committee’, note that it is written as one word despite the two elements). Some {{acronyms}} created from common names are still written in <b>uppercase,</b> though, especially in sciences (URH < ultrarövidhullám ‘ultra-high-frequency’) but other capitalized acronyms may be accepted too (TDK < tudományos diákkör ‘students’ scholarly circle’). In some cases, full-fledged words are created from the pronounced form of acronyms standing for common names (e.g. tévé < tv < televízió).|$|E
