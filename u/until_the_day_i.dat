[...] He stated: [...] "We have consistently won the case as it has been presented in court. We have consistently lost the case as it has been presented in the public realm, on TV and elsewhere." [...] Members of MacPhail's family were also convinced of Davis's guilt, and thought his execution would bring a measure of peace. His mother reported [...] "That hole in my heart will be there <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> die, but it [...] may give me some peace and quiet." [...] Mark MacPhail, Jr. stated [...] "It's not animosity or anger or rage that has kept us going; that's not what my father would want. It's justice. The law is what he was all about.

As Gibson later put it, [...] "this was remedied by volunteer contributions from the lingerie of the women and the garments of men." [...] Those aboard had to sit for hours with their feet soaking in ice-cold water. When Titanic went down at 2:20a.m., the noise of hundreds of people screaming for help was heard by the lifeboat's occupants, a sound that Gibson said would [...] "remain in my memory <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> die." [...] Hogg wanted to turn back to pick up some of those in the water but was shouted down by the boat's occupants. They drifted for some time until they came within reach of Boat 5.

The two boats were lashed together for the rest of the night until they separated to meet the RMS Carpathia.|$|E

6000|$|By way of an apologue for the aged, {{when they}} feel more than usually tempted to offer their advice, let me {{recommend}} the following little tale. A child who had been remarkably fond of toys (and in particular of lead soldiers) found himself growing {{to the level of}} acknowledged boyhood without any abatement of this childish taste. He was thirteen; already he had been taunted for dallying over-long about the playbox; he had to blush if he was found among his lead soldiers; the shades of the prison-house were closing about him with a vengeance. There is nothing more difficult than to put the thoughts of children into the language of their elders; but this is the effect of his meditations at this juncture: [...] "Plainly," [...] he said, [...] "I must give up my playthings in the meanwhile, since I am {{not in a position to}} secure myself against idle jeers. At the same time, I am sure that playthings are the very pick of life; all people give them up out of the same pusillanimous respect for those who are a little older; and if they do not return to them as soon as they can, it is only because they grow stupid and forget. I shall be wiser; I shall conform for a little to the ways of their foolish world; but so soon as I have made enough money, I shall retire and shut myself up among my playthings <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> die." [...] Nay, as he was passing in the train along the Esterel mountains between Cannes and Fréjus, he remarked a pretty house in an orange garden at the angle of a bay, and decided that this should be his Happy Valley. Astrea Redux; childhood was to come again! The idea has an air of simple nobility to me, not unworthy of Cincinnatus. And yet, as the reader has probably anticipated, it is never likely to be carried into effect. There was a worm i' the bud, a fatal error in the premises. Childhood must pass away, and then youth, as surely as age approaches. The true wisdom is to be always seasonable, and to change with a good grace in changing circumstances. To love playthings well as a child, to lead an adventurous and honourable youth, and to settle when the time arrives, into a green and smiling age, is to be a good artist in life and deserve well of yourself and your neighbour.|$|E
