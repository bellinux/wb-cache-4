40|$|Abstract [...] Traveller has a {{great impact}} on yarn quality {{parameters}} specially hairiness. Yarn quality varies due to different traveller number. The traveller imparts twist to the yarn and enables winding of the yarn on the cop. However, cooperating assembly, the spindle is required for the winding operation. High contact pressure (up to 35 N/mm 2) is generated between the ring and traveller during winding, mainly due to centrifugal force. This research was established according to yarn parameter of hairiness, U%, IPI, i. e. imperfection index and end breakage rate per 1000 spindle-hr. It is very important for the technologist to understand this and act on them to optimize the yarn production. Specific number of traveller should be used for a particular count of yarn.

40|$|In {{order to}} be able to {{quantify}} yarn evenness, testing instruments were developed, based on different methods and progressively improving their performance. Most of them use principle based on drawing the yarn under test between the plates of a condenser, so that the yarn and the air are the dielectric material that changes the capacitor characteristics, which is proportional to the mass of small lengths of the yarn (8 mm). Knowledge of the yarn mass in 1 mm range is of most importance to evaluated properly the yarn evenness; furthermore several irregularities can only be properly detected of this mass evaluation is possible in this range. In this paper, a study is presented in order to achieve mass variation in 1 mm length. Simulation results are presented and compared with <b>Uster</b> <b>Tester</b> III.

40|$|In this paper, a new yarn {{appearance}} {{measurement system}} based on machine vision is introduced. The yarn images are continuously captured by image acquisition system. To extract {{the main body of}} the yarn accurately, the yarn images are processed sequentially with threshold segmentation and morphological opening operation. Then the coefficient of variation (CV value) of diameter is calculated to characterize the yarn evenness. The measurement process achieves result (CV value) which can be compared with <b>USTER</b> evenness <b>tester</b> by image processing techniques. By comparing different methods which use different algorithms, a suitable method is chosen to be used in this new measurement system. Then a more accurate, more efficient and faster measurement system will meet requirements in the future...|$|R

40|$|Estudaram-se a regularidade e a quantidade de "neps" em fios de algodão de títulos Ne 20, Ne 30 e Ne 40 para diferentes coeficientes de torção, representados pelas constantes 3, 4, 3, 6, 3, 8, 4, 0, 4, 2, 4, 5 e 4, 7. Utilizaram-se, para tanto, três variedades paulistas de algodoeiro: IAC 16, IAC 13 - 1 e IAC 17. Obtiveram-se a regularidade dos fios e a quantidade de "neps" por meio dos resultados fornecidos, respectivamente, pelo integrador e pelo contador de imperfeições, ambos da linha <b>Uster</b> Evenness <b>Tester.</b> Com base nos resultados, concluiu-se que, ao aumento do número de torções do fio, correspondeu o crescimento do número de "neps", o qual se intensificou, sucessivamente, nos títulos Ne 20, Ne 30 e Ne 40, e, notadamente, nas variedades com tendência acentuada para essa anormalidade. Não se verificou efeito da torção na regularidade do fio. Títulos mais altos resultaram em aumentos na irregularidade e na quantidade de "neps", sobretudo em relação à IAC 13 - 1, mais sujeita a esses defeitos. The fibers {{of three}} cotton {{varieties}} (IAC 16, IAC 13 - 1 and IAC 17) were processed on conventional equipment into 20 / 1, 30 / 1 and 40 / 1 yarn counts, using {{a range of}} twist multipliers of 3. 4, 3. 6, 3. 8, 4. 0, 4. 2, 4. 5 and 4. 7, to study the twist effect on uniformity and nep count of cotton yarns. The yarn regularity was obtained through the results provided by an integrator and the quantity of neps by an imperfection counter, both of the <b>Uster</b> Evenness <b>Tester</b> line. The results showed a direct response {{on the number of}} twists, as compared to neps using Ne 20, Ne 30 and Ne 40 yarn counts, depending on the cotton variety. The yarn regularity was not affected. Increasing the yarn counts, increased the irregularity and the quantity of neps, mainly in the variety showing higher tendency to these abnormalities...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Yarn {{hairiness}} is one {{of important}} yarn parameters, which is used for yarn production quality control. It is usually characterized {{by the amount of}} free fibers (fibre loops, fibre ends) protruding from the compact yarn body towards the outer yarn surface. The first question can be if hairiness is really important and why? The reason is obtaining deeper information about yarn structure and its changes during processing. Thanks to detailed knowledge it is possible predict to yarn behaviour and design fabric and textile products precisely in the way the customers demand. Yarn hairiness and its determining is important because it influences the post spinning operation and parameters of textile product (porosity, permeability, transport of moisture, comfort, aesthetic properties and hand). The main factors influencing hairiness are: type of fibres, yarn twist, yarn count, blending ratio, yarn technology production, approach to yarn hairiness observation and measurement condition. This paper concentrates on the influence of yarn construction parameter (yarn count, yarn twist) and technology of production (ring comb and carded, experimental and open end). In this case, the <b>Uster</b> <b>Tester</b> 4 and the new optical approach for yarn hairiness investigation is applied. Results for experimental sets of yarn will be shown...|$|E

This paper describes various illumination and image pro- cessing techniques for yarn characterization. Darkfield and back-lit illuminations are compared in terms of depth of field tolerance and image quality. Experiments show that back-lit illumination is superior in terms of depth of field tolerance and contrast. Three different back-lit illumination configurations are studied: one simply employ- ing a light source placed behind the yarn, the other incorporating a field lens to increase the light intensity passing through the aperture, and the third using a mirror placed at 45 ° to the optical axis to enable imaging of two orthogonal views of the yarn core. Problems in defining the hair–core boundaries in high resolution yarn pictures are addressed and a filtering process is introduced for back-lit im- ages. A comparison of the diameter and diameter coefficient of variation percentage measurements for different illumination and im- age processing techniques is given for several yarn samples. The data are also correlated with Premier 7000 diametric irregularity tester and <b>Uster</b> <b>Tester</b> 3 irregularity measurements. © 2005 SPIE and IS&T...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to build}} a computer-based system for measuring slub yarn characteristics and evaluating the results using statistical methods. The measuring system {{was based on the}} electrical condenser of the <b>Uster</b> evenness <b>tester</b> as a measuring sensor. A digital storage oscilloscope was used to convert the analogue output signals into digital data to be recorded on a computer. A designed computer program was constructed using MatLab language for signal analysis based on a proposed method. Final results from this system contained graphical plots for the three measured slub yarn geometrical parameters slub length, slub distance, and slub thickness and a final report for all the measured slub yarn characteristics. The results of tested slub yarn samples showed that actual slub geometrical parameters differ from nominal values and the difference had two level: prevailing difference and outlier values. Outliers which are considered slub yarn defects were detected and counted in a final report using the box plot statistical method which could be an effective industrial tool for evaluation of both yarn quality and machine performance. The prevailing difference was assessed using histogram comparison which could help in adjusting the setting of slub yarn device to obtain the required appearance...|$|R
