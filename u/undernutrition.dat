5|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) {{predicts that}} {{overweight}} and obesity may soon replace more traditional public health concerns such as <b>undernutrition</b> {{and infectious diseases}} as the most significant cause of poor health. Obesity is a public health and policy problem because of its prevalence, costs, and health effects. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for all adults followed by behavioral interventions in those who are obese. Public health efforts seek to understand and correct the environmental factors responsible for the increasing prevalence of obesity in the population. Solutions look at changing the factors that cause excess food energy consumption and inhibit physical activity. Efforts include federally reimbursed meal programs in schools, limiting direct junk food marketing to children, and decreasing access to sugar-sweetened beverages in schools. The World Health Organization recommends the taxing of sugary drinks. When constructing urban environments, efforts {{have been made to}} increase access to parks and to develop pedestrian routes.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{from the}} Centre for World Food Studies in 2003 {{found that the}} gap between levels of <b>undernutrition</b> in men and women is {{generally}} small, but that the gap varies from region to region and from country to country. These small-scale studies showed that female <b>undernutrition</b> prevalence rates exceeded male <b>undernutrition</b> prevalence rates in South/Southeast Asia and Latin America and were lower in Sub-Saharan Africa. Datasets for Ethiopia and Zimbabwe reported <b>undernutrition</b> rates between 1.5 and 2 times higher in men than in women; however, in India and Pakistan, datasets rates of <b>undernutrition</b> were 1.5-2 times higher in women than in men. Intra-country variation also occurs, with frequent high gaps between regional <b>undernutrition</b> rates. Gender inequality in nutrition in some countries such as India is present in all stages of life.|$|E
25|$|<b>Undernutrition</b> {{encompasses}} {{stunted growth}} (stunting), wasting, and deficiencies of essential {{vitamins and minerals}} (collectively referred to as micronutrients). The term hunger, which describes a feeling of discomfort from not eating, {{has been used to}} describe <b>undernutrition,</b> especially in reference to food insecurity.|$|E
25|$|Malnutrition {{is caused}} by eating a diet in which {{nutrients}} are not enough or are too much such that it causes health problems. It is a category of diseases that includes <b>undernutrition</b> and overnutrition. Overnutrition can result in obesity and being overweight. In some developing countries, overnutrition {{in the form of}} obesity is beginning to present within the same communities as <b>undernutrition.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{partnership}} , led by IFPRI {{with the}} involvement of UN organisations, NGOs and private foundations develops and disseminates evidence-based advice to politicians and other decision-makers aimed at ending hunger and <b>undernutrition</b> in the coming 10 years, by 2025. It bases its claim that hunger can be ended by 2025 on a report by Shenggen Fan and Paul Polman that analyzed the experiences from China, Vietnam, Brazil and Thailand and concludes that eliminating hunger and <b>undernutrition</b> was possible by 2025.|$|E
25|$|There were 793million undernourished {{people in}} the world in 2015 (13% of the total population). This is a {{reduction}} of 216million people since 1990 when 23% were undernourished. In 2012 it was estimated that another billion people had a lack of vitamins and minerals. In 2015, protein-energy malnutrition was estimated to have resulted in 323,000 deaths—down from 510,000 deaths in 1990. Other nutritional deficiencies, which include iodine deficiency and iron deficiency anemia, result in another 83,000 deaths. In 2010, malnutrition was the cause of 1.4% of all disability adjusted life years. About a third of deaths in children are believed to be due to <b>undernutrition,</b> although the deaths are rarely labelled as such. In 2010, it was estimated to have contributed to about 1.5 million deaths in women and children, though some estimate the number may be greater than 3million. An additional 165million children were estimated to have stunted growth from malnutrition in 2013. <b>Undernutrition</b> is more common in developing countries. Certain groups have higher rates of <b>undernutrition,</b> including women—in particular while pregnant or breastfeeding—children under five years of age, and the elderly. In the elderly, <b>undernutrition</b> becomes more common due to physical, psychological, and social factors.|$|E
25|$|Malnutrition is a {{condition}} that results from eating a diet in which nutrients are either not enough or are too much such that the diet causes health problems. It may involve calories, protein, carbohydrates, vitamins or minerals. Not enough nutrients is called <b>undernutrition</b> or undernourishment while too much is called overnutrition. Malnutrition {{is often used to}} specifically refer to <b>undernutrition</b> where an individual is not getting enough calories, protein, or micronutrients. If <b>undernutrition</b> occurs during pregnancy, or before two years of age, it may result in permanent problems with physical and mental development. Extreme undernourishment, known as starvation, may have symptoms that include: a short height, thin body, very poor energy levels, and swollen legs and abdomen. People also often get infections and are frequently cold. The symptoms of micronutrient deficiencies depend on the micronutrient that is lacking.|$|E
25|$|The figures {{provided}} {{in this section}} on epidemiology all refer to <b>undernutrition</b> even if the term malnutrition is used which, by definition, could also apply to too much nutrition.|$|E
25|$|<b>Undernutrition</b> is an {{important}} determinant of maternal and child health, accounting {{for more than a}} third of child deaths and more than 10 percent of the total global disease burden according to 2008 studies.|$|E
25|$|M. S. Swaminathan is also {{a member}} of the Leadership Council of , a {{partnership}} that develops and disseminates evidence-based advice to politicians and other decision-makers aimed at ending hunger and <b>undernutrition</b> in the coming 10 years.|$|E
25|$|<b>Undernutrition</b> during pregnancy, {{and other}} factors, may cause intrauterine growth {{retardation}} (IUGR), {{which is one}} cause of low birth weight. However, {{it has been suggested}} that in IUGR the brain may be selectively spared. Brain growth is usually less affected than whole body weight or length. Several studies from developed nations have found that with the exception of extreme intrauterine growth retardation also affecting brain growth, and hypoxic injury, IUGR seems to have little or no measurable effect on mental performance and behavior in adolescence or adulthood. For example, acute <b>undernutrition</b> for a few months during the Dutch famine of 1944 caused a decrease in mean birthweight in certain areas. This was later associated with a change in performance on IQ tests for 18–19 years old Dutch males draftees from these areas compared to control areas. The subjects were exposed to famine prenatally but not after birth. During the famine, births decreased more among those with lower socioeconomic status (SES), whereas after the famine, there was a compensatory increase in births among those with lower SES. Since SES correlates with IQ, this may have hidden an effect caused by the <b>undernutrition.</b>|$|E
25|$|Unless {{specifically}} mentioned otherwise, {{the term}} malnutrition refers to <b>undernutrition</b> {{for the remainder}} of this article. Malnutrition can be divided into two different types, SAM and MAM. SAM refers to children with severe acute malnutrition. MAM refers to moderate acute malnutrition.|$|E
25|$|<b>Undernutrition</b> is {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} synonym of protein–energy malnutrition (PEM). While other include both micronutrient deficiencies and protein energy malnutrition in its definition. It differs from calorie restriction in that calorie restriction may not result in negative health effects. The term hypoalimentation means underfeeding.|$|E
25|$|Lowered {{blood supply}} to the fetus in {{pre-eclampsia}} causes lowered nutrient supply, which could result in intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and low birth weight. The fetal origins hypothesis states that fetal <b>undernutrition</b> is linked with coronary heart disease later in adult life due to disproportionate growth.|$|E
25|$|In June 2015, the European Union and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation have {{launched}} a partnership to combat <b>undernutrition</b> especially in children. The program will initiatilly {{be implemented in}} Bangladesh, Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Laos and Niger and will help these countries to improve information and analysis about nutrition so they can develop effective national nutrition policies.|$|E
25|$|In humans, an {{unhealthy}} diet can cause deficiency-related {{diseases such as}} blindness, anemia, scurvy, preterm birth, stillbirth and cretinism, or nutrient excess health-threatening conditions such as obesity and metabolic syndrome; and such common chronic systemic diseases as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and osteoporosis. <b>Undernutrition</b> {{can lead to the}} wasting of kwashiorkor in acute cases, and the stunting of marasmus in chronic cases of malnutrition.|$|E
25|$|Studies on {{nutrition}} concerning {{gender bias}} within households look at patterns of food allocation, and one study from 2003 suggested that women often receive a lower share of food requirements than men. Gender discrimination, gender roles, and social norms affecting women {{can lead to}} early marriage and childbearing, close birth spacing, and <b>undernutrition,</b> all of which contribute to malnourished mothers.|$|E
25|$|Open {{defecation}} perpetuates {{the vicious}} cycle {{of disease and}} poverty and {{is widely regarded as}} an affront to personal dignity. The countries where open defecation is most widely practised have the highest numbers of deaths of {{children under the age of}} five, as well as high levels of <b>undernutrition,</b> high levels of poverty, and large disparities between the rich and poor.|$|E

25|$|The Capital Area Food Bank is {{the largest}} {{organization}} in the Washington metro area working to solve hunger and its companion problems: chronic <b>undernutrition,</b> heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. By partnering with 444 community organizations in the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia, as well as delivering food directly into hard to reach areas, each year the Capital Area Food Bank helps give 540,000 people access to good, healthy food.|$|E
25|$|The main global {{policy to}} reduce hunger and poverty are the Sustainable Development Goals. In {{particular}} Goal 2: Zero hunger sets globally agreed targets to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture. The partnership Compact2025, led by IFPRI with {{the involvement of}} UN organisations, NGOs and private foundations develops and disseminates evidence-based advice to politicians and other decision-makers aimed at ending hunger and <b>undernutrition</b> in the coming 10 years, by 2025.|$|E
25|$|New {{technology}} in agricultural production also has great potential to combat <b>undernutrition.</b> By improving agricultural yields, farmers could reduce poverty by increasing income {{as well as}} open up area for diversification of crops for household use. The World Bank itself claims {{to be part of}} the solution to malnutrition, asserting that the best way for countries to succeed in breaking the cycle of poverty and malnutrition is to build export-led economies that will give them the financial means to buy foodstuffs on the world market.|$|E
25|$|According to the World Health Organization, hunger is {{the single}} gravest threat to the world's public health. The WHO also states that {{malnutrition}} {{is by far the}} biggest contributor to child mortality, present in half of all cases. <b>Undernutrition</b> is a contributory factor in the death of 3.1 million children under five every year. Figures on actual starvation are difficult to come by, but according to the Food and Agriculture Organization, the less severe condition of undernourishment currently affects about 842 million people, or about one in eight (12.5%) people in the world population.|$|E
25|$|Undernourishment is {{most often}} due to not enough {{high-quality}} food being available to eat. This is often related to high food prices and poverty. A lack of breastfeeding may contribute, as may a number of infectious diseases such as: gastroenteritis, pneumonia, malaria, and measles, which increase nutrient requirements. There are two main types of undernutrition: protein-energy malnutrition and dietary deficiencies. Protein-energy malnutrition has two severe forms: marasmus (a lack of protein and calories) and kwashiorkor (a lack of just protein). Common micronutrient deficiencies include: a lack of iron, iodine, and vitamin A. During pregnancy, due to the body's increased need, deficiencies may become more common. In some developing countries, overnutrition {{in the form of}} obesity is beginning to present within the same communities as <b>undernutrition.</b> Other causes of malnutrition include anorexia nervosa and bariatric surgery.|$|E
25|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) {{recommends}} rehydrating {{a severely}} undernourished {{child who has}} diarrhea relatively slowly. The preferred method is with fluids by mouth using a drink called oral rehydration solution (ORS). The oral rehydration solution is both slightly sweet and slightly salty and the one recommended in those with severe <b>undernutrition</b> should have half the usual sodium and greater potassium. Fluids by nasogastric tube may be use in {{those who do not}} drink. Intravenous fluids are recommended only in those who have significant dehydration due to their potential complications. These complications include congestive heart failure. Over time, ORS developed into ORT, or oral rehydration therapy, which focused on increasing fluids by supplying salts, carbohydrates, and water. This switch from type of fluid to amount of fluid was crucial in order to prevent dehydration from diarrhea.|$|E
25|$|Growth {{retardation}} may occur, as {{height gain}} may slow and can stop completely with severe weight loss or chronic malnutrition. In such cases, provided that growth potential is preserved, height increase can resume and reach full potential after normal intake is resumed. Height potential is normally preserved if the duration {{and severity of}} illness are not significant or if the illness is accompanied by delayed bone age (especially prior to a bone age of approximately 15 years), as hypogonadism may partially counteract the effects of <b>undernutrition</b> on height by allowing for a longer duration of growth compared to controls. Appropriate early treatment can preserve height potential, and may even help to increase it in some post-anorexic subjects, due to factors such as long-term reduced estrogen-producing adipose tissue levels compared to premorbid levels. In some cases, especially where onset is before puberty, complications such as stunted growth and pubertal delay are usually reversible.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the term}} {{malnutrition}} {{is commonly used}} to refer to <b>undernutrition</b> only. This applies particularly to the context of development cooperation.

Eventual weight loss due to reduced appetite and <b>undernutrition</b> is common. Pain behind the breastbone or in the region around the stomach [...] often feels like heartburn. The pain can frequently be severe, worsening when food of any sort is swallowed.
