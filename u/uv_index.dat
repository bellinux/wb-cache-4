For example, if a light-skinned individual (without sunscreen or a suntan) begins to sunburn in 30 minutes at <b>UV</b> <b>Index</b> 6, then that individual should expect to sunburn in about 15 minutes at <b>UV</b> <b>Index</b> 12 – twice the UV, twice as fast.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} Australian adults' {{awareness of}} the ultraviolet (<b>UV)</b> <b>indexes</b> forecast in the media, and whether these UV forecasts influence their behaviour in the sun. Methods: A self-administered questionnaire was used on two occasions in 1997 to ask about knowledge of <b>UV</b> <b>indexes</b> shown {{in the media and}} about possible influence on outdoor behaviour. Setting and participants: Participants were 977 residents (423 men; 554 women) of Nambour originally randomly selected in 1986 from the electoral roll, who have been followed up subsequently. Results:The majority of people - 92 % of men and 86 % of women - reported having seen or heard the <b>UV</b> <b>indexes</b> forecast during summer. Of these, significantly fewer men (107; 28 %) than women (209; 46 %) reported that their outdoor behaviour was influenced by knowledge of the forecast (p= 0. 001). Neither age nor skin type, nor history of sunburns or skin cancer, affected knowledge of UV forecasts or their influence on behaviour. Conclusions and Implications Although most people are aware of the forecasts of <b>UV</b> <b>indexes</b> in the media, the majority do not take them into account in their outdoor behaviour. Compared with women, men were more aware of, but less influenced by, forecasts of <b>UV</b> <b>indexes.</b> Better communication of the implications of the <b>UV</b> <b>indexes</b> is needed, particularly to men, if they are to adapt their outdoor behaviour to improve their sun protection...|$|R

We analyze the trends of <b>UV</b> <b>indices</b> with respect to age and chemical composition. As a first test against observations, we compare our results with the empirical mid-UV spectral indices of Galactic globular clusters, observed with the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE). We find that synthetic indices exhibit a variety of properties, the main one being the slight age sensitivity of most of them for ages> 2 Gyr. However, for high metallicity, two indices, Fe ii 2332 and Fe ii 2402, display a remarkably different pattern, with a sharp increase within the first two Gyr and, thereafter, a rapid decline. These indices clearly mark the presence of young (∼ 1 Gyr) metal rich (Z ≥ Z⊙) stellar populations. We complement existing <b>UV</b> <b>indices</b> of Galactic globular clusters with new measurements, and carefully identify a sub-sample of ten indices suitable for comparison with theoretical models.

The Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) mission measures the vertical distribution of aerosols and clouds. Aerosols and clouds play important roles in the atmosphere and climate system. Accurately detecting their presence, altitude, and properties using satellite radiance measurements is a very important task. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the CALIPSO Version 2 Vertical Feature Mask (VFM) product with the (OMI) <b>UV</b> Aerosol <b>Index</b> (<b>UV</b> AI) and reflectivity datasets for a full year of 2007.

It was found that the spatial-temporal correlation found between CALIPSO and OMI observations, is strongly dependent on aerosol types and cloud contamination. CALIPSO is more sensitivity to cloud and often misidentifies desert dust aerosols as cloud, while some small scale aerosol layers as well as some pollution aerosols are unidentified by OMI UV AI. Large differences in aerosol distribution patterns between CALIPSO and OMI are observed, especially for the smoke and pollution aerosol dominated areas.

25|$|Melanin is {{a natural}} pigment {{produced}} by cells called melanocytes in a process called melanogenesis. Melanocytes produce two types of melanin: pheomelanin (red) and eumelanin (very dark brown). Melanin protects the body by absorbing ultraviolet radiation. Excessive UV radiation causes sunburn along with other direct and indirect DNA damage to the skin, and the body naturally combats and seeks {{to repair the damage}} and protect the skin by creating and releasing further melanin into the skin's cells. With the production of the melanin, the skin color darkens. The tanning process can be triggered by natural sunlight or by artificial UV radiation, which can be delivered in frequencies of UVA, UVB, or a combination of both. The intensity is commonly measured by the <b>UV</b> <b>Index.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>UV</b> <b>Index</b> is {{a number}} linearly related to the {{intensity}} of sunburn-producing UV radiation at a given point on the earth's surface. It cannot be simply related to the irradiance (measured in W/m2) because the UV of greatest concern occupies a spectrum of wavelength from 295 to 325nm, and shorter wavelengths have already been absorbed a great deal when they arrive at the earth's surface. Skin damage from sunburn, however, is related to wavelength, the shorter wavelengths being much more damaging. The UV power spectrum (expressed as Watts per square metre per nanometre of wavelength) is therefore multiplied by a weighting curve known as the erythemal action spectrum, and the result integrated over the whole spectrum. This gave Canadian scientists a weighted figure (sometimes called Diffey-weighted UV irradiance, or DUV, or erythemal dose rate) typically around 250mW/m2 in midday summer sunlight. So, they arbitrarily divided by 25mW/m2 to generate a convenient index value, essentially a scale of 0 to 11+ (though ozone depletion is now resulting in higher values, as mentioned above).|$|E
500|$|The {{long-term}} effects {{from a nearby}} burst are more dangerous. Gamma rays cause chemical reactions in the atmosphere involving oxygen and nitrogen molecules, creating first nitrogen oxide then nitrogen dioxide gas. The nitrogen oxides cause dangerous effects on three levels. First, they deplete ozone, with models showing a possible global reduction of 25-35%, with as much as 75% in certain locations, an effect that would last for years. This reduction is enough to cause a dangerously elevated <b>UV</b> <b>index</b> at the surface. Secondly, the nitrogen oxides cause photochemical smog, which darkens the sky and blocks out parts of the sunlight spectrum. This would affect photosynthesis, but models show only about a 1% reduction of the total sunlight spectrum, lasting a few years. However, the smog could potentially cause a cooling effect on Earth's climate, producing a [...] "cosmic winter" [...] (similar to an impact winter, but without an impact), but only if it occurs simultaneously with a global climate instability. Thirdly, the elevated nitrogen levels in the atmosphere would wash out and produce nitric acid rain.

The nitrates might in fact be of benefit to some plants.|$|E
