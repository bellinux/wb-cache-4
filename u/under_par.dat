40|$|Supplementary ultraviolet-B {{radiation}} (UV-B) caused {{decreases in}} mRNA levels for photosynthetic genes {{and for the}} chloroplastic defensive enzyme Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase. The magnitude of these decreases depended on {{the intensity of the}} photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) : the mRNA levels being considerably higher <b>under</b> high <b>PAR</b> (400 - 600 /iE m" 2 s" 1) than under low (150 fiE m~ 2 s" 1). Transcript levels for the non-chloroplastic de-fence protein chalcone synthase also were PAR-depend-ent, since an increase of mRNA transcripts occurred <b>under</b> low <b>PAR</b> only. UV-B also caused a PAR-independent in-crease in the rates of relaxation of the single turnover flash-induced electrochromic shift of thylakoid pigments. The UV-B doses needed were about 10 -fold lower than the doses needed to affect photosynthetic components. Chloro-phyll content and chlorophyll fluorescence of PSII were unaltered by these doses. We suggest that the lowered sensi-tivity of mRNA levels <b>under</b> high <b>PAR</b> may be caused by a protective mechanism at the level of DNA or transcription. This mechanism would not be involved in repair of the thy-lakoid membrane or its lipids. These results also highlight the importance of PAR intensity for the assessing of UV-B effects on plants.

40|$|The {{acclimation}} {{response of}} the barley photosynthetic apparatus was examined aft er transfer of plants grown under low and high PAR to common conditions both with the same PAR and acute dose of UV-A and/or UV-B radiation.

Contrary to UV-B radiation, UV-A exposure of barley plants acclimated to low PAR had no {{negative impact on the}} function of photosynthetic apparatus. Th e UV-A spectral region we used (350 – 400 nm) can be eff ectively utilised in photosynthetic reactions, thus compensating low PAR. Th e presence of UV-A radiation during acclimation to simultaneous UVA and UVB treatment not only mitigated but completely eliminated any negative eff ect of UV-B radiation on the photosynthetic function.

However, moderate levels of UVR increased PIC production rates and PIC/POC ratios. OA treatment interacted with UVR to influence the alga's physiological performance, leading to reduced specific growth rate in the presence of UVA (315 - 400 nm) and decreased quantum yield, along with enhanced nonphotochemical quenching, with addition of UVB (280 - 315 nm).
