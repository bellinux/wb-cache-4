40|$|Abstract: This article {{presents}} {{an overview of}} coercive purchase of a missing part of a plot, which is a procedure carried out {{in accordance with the}} Real Estate Formation Act (554 / 1995). The procedure aims to enable the implementation of a detailed level land use plan for building purposes in situations where the real property division and ownership do not correspond to the plan. According to planning and building legislation, a requirement for a building permit to be issued is the <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership,</b> which means that the area of plot or building site defined in the land use plan must be in the possession of the same title holder or holders. The article aims, firstly, to present the regulation concerning the coercive purchase of a missing part of a plot as well as issues concerning the valuation of the plot in the procedure. Secondly, the aim is to discuss the experience of using this tool based on an empirical study. The empirical study was conducted as questionnaire survey, which was sent to municipal and state authorities carrying out the said procedure...|$|E

So hat sich gezeigt, dass kleinere Familienunternehmen verh 4 ltnism 4 gro Innovationsvorteile aufweisen. Die Studie liefert auch Hinweise daf, dass insbesondere 4 ltere Familienunternehmen eine h 6 here Anzahl von FuE-Kooperationen eingehen. Zudem verkleinern Familienunternehmen seltener ihren Personalbestand. Dies wirkt sich ebenfalls positiv auf ihr Innovationsverhalten aus. Allerdings gibt es auch Faktoren, die das Innovationsverhalten von Familienunternehmen negativ beeinflussen: So zeigt sich, dass die Innovationsneigung in der Gr am h 6 chsten ist, aber mit jeder nachfolgenden Generation signifikant abnimmt - zum Teil unter das Niveau von Nicht-Familienunternehmen. Prior {{findings}} are inconclusive concerning the innovation activities of family SMEs {{when compared to}} non-family counterparts. This study overcomes these shortcomings by analyzing specific determinants influencing the innovation output of family SMEs. Using data of 1. 870 SMEs located in Germany, we argue that the main characteristic of family SMEs is the <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> and leadership when compared their non-family counterparts. Deriving a set of hypotheses from this assumption, we find that local embeddedness, long-term orientation and effective corporate governance structures positively affect the ability to generate product and process innovations family firms. We can show, for example, that older family firms conduct more research and development activities with partners due to emergent regional networks. We also find that the innovation output continuously falls from generation to generation...|$|E

Yet fairness and equity require that capital income be taxed.; This article reviews the options for achieving improved harmonization of taxation within the European Community (EC). A formula apportionment system, such as exists in the United States, could help EC countries curb tax avoidance by corporations that shift income away from subsidiaries in high-tax areas. The author also considers the "unitary combination" approach, whereby a business is considered a single taxpayer if it has <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> operation, <b>ownership,</b> and use.

50|$|The self-model is {{the central}} concept {{in the theory of}} {{consciousness}} called the self-model theory of subjectivity (SMT). This concept comprises experiences <b>of</b> <b>ownership,</b> <b>of</b> first person perspective, and <b>of</b> a long-term <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> beliefs and attitudes. These features are instantiated in the prefrontal cortex. This theory is an interdisciplinary approach to understanding and explaining the phenomenology of consciousness and the self. This theory has two core contents, the phenomenal self-model (PSM) and the phenomenal model of the intentionality relation (PMIR). Thomas Metzinger advanced the theory in his 1993 book Subjekt und Selbstmodell (Subject and self-model).|$|R
40|$|We {{argue that}} thought {{insertion}} primarily involves {{a disruption of}} the sense <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> for thoughts and {{that the lack of}} a sense of agency is but a consequence of this disruption.

Loss <b>of</b> <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> consciousness, manifested by incoherent subjective experiences is a general phenomenal characteristic of schizophrenia. This loss of coherence has been hypothesized to reflect a generalized deficit of contextual information integration not conveyed by, but related to, a target event. This deficit is manifested across many cognitive domains. We argue that it is also manifested in the process of thinking itself, resulting in causally decontextualized thoughts that are experienced as inserted thoughts...|$|R

40|$|The {{qualitative}} character of consciousness, its what-it-is-likeness, is a contested issue, both in philosophy and psychology. I argue that, {{rather than by}} conceptual analyses, the status of what-it-is-likeness has {{to be decided by}} empirical investigation. Pending the outcome, we should maintain an agnostic stance, in order to remove the bias in favor of fictionalism from our study of consciousness,. I illustrate this with the notion <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> <b>unity.</b> People adhere to the belief of a single, unified self as the owner of their experiences, in spite of abundant dis-unities in the informational content of their experience. On one reading, this supports the notion that the <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> experience {{is no more than a}} convenient fiction, based on an illusory experience <b>of</b> <b>unity.</b> Cognitive neuroscience is slanted in favor of such understanding, insofar it emphasizes functional specialization and localization. To restore the balance, I present a complementary perspective: the view that the experience <b>of</b> <b>unity</b> is afforded by the intrinsic, multiscale brain dynamics. This approach offers a biological substrate for <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> experience as a regular scenario within certain boundary conditions, as well mechanisms that may let it go astray...|$|R

40|$|The {{roots of}} the 2008 global {{financial}} crisis that originated in the United States subprime mortgage market are firstly traced to the demand side of financing. Borrower preferences are explained {{to be based on}} excessiveness <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> and spending. Such excessive consumer preferences are matched up with the suppliers’ decision to allow easy lending and accumulation of multiple debt-ridden loans. The cost of such financial excessiveness is shown to be the rate of interest. The relevance of interest rate in efficient financing and economic resource mobilization is questioned here from the theoretical side. Its rejection and replacement by participatory financing instruments in the good things of life is formalized. A new financial architectural design is thus laid out in terms of the central issue of money, finance and real economy complementary relations. These relations can be simulated by circular causation equations. The foundational conceptual premise is governed by the episteme <b>of</b> <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> knowledge.

I streamline this solution and bring it up to date. I contrast this conventionalist theory with Frege’s unsaturatedness theory. I show that Frege’s theory is mystical, ad hoc, ineffective and paradoxical, and that it entails that singular terms cannot be predicates. I argue that the conventionalist account is free of these defects and that it provides a clear and intelligible solution to the problem <b>of</b> the <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> the sentence. I suggest that the problem <b>of</b> the <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> the proposition is spurious. I recommend that the notion of unsaturatedness be extruded from serious debate.
