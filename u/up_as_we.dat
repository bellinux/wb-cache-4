500|$|Alistair Taylor (Epstein's assistant) later {{admitted}} that financial mistakes were made: [...] "We did our best; {{some people have}} said it wasn't good enough. That's easy to say with 20/20 hindsight but remember {{that there were no}} rules. We were making it <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> went along." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Murphy commented {{on the structure of}} the series' first season. [...] "I loved how it began. I loved it in the middle and I loved the end. The only thing really frustrating for me, to be honest with you, is that sometimes people would write this idea that we were making it <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> went along and I wanted to say, 'Really?' But I think now people are writing and saying, 'Oh yeah!' I'm excited for people to see it on DVD, because now that they know how it ended, [...] go back and see all of the little things, like people who have no reflections in mirrors. When you go back, you will see everything was set up." [...] When asked if the House [...] "pulled" [...] the Harmons to it, Murphy responded, [...] "I don't know if they were targeted. I don't think the Internet site had any supernatural pull to it...although that would have been hilarious. I thought it was two things: it was house porn because I think that house really is extraordinary. And also I think there's always that allure in American lives of the fresh start, moving West, starting fresh." ...|$|E
500|$|In early 1948, Mackenzie King, by now aged 73, {{announced}} his retirement; {{later that year}} Louis St. Laurent succeeded him. Although Bracken had nearly doubled the Tory representation in the House, prominent Tories were increasingly unhappy with his leadership, and pressured him to stand down. These party bosses believed that Ontario Premier George A. Drew, who had won three successive provincial elections and had even made inroads in francophone ridings, was the man to lead the Progressive Conservatives to victory. When Bracken resigned on July 17, 1948, Diefenbaker {{announced his}} candidacy. The party's backers, principally financiers headquartered on Toronto's Bay Street, preferred Drew's conservative political stances to Diefenbaker's Western populism. Tory leaders packed the leadership convention in Ottawa in favour of Drew, appointing more than 300 delegates at-large. One cynical party member commented, [...] "Ghost delegates with ghost ballots, marked by the ghostly hidden hand of Bay Street, are going to pick George Drew, and he'll deliver a ghost-written speech that'll cheer us all <b>up,</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> march briskly into a political graveyard." [...] Drew easily defeated Diefenbaker on the first ballot. St. Laurent called an election for June 1949, and the Tories were decimated, falling to 41 seats, only two more than the party's 1940 nadir. Despite intense efforts to make the Progressive Conservatives appeal to Quebecers, the party won only two seats in the province.|$|E

2500|$|The {{series is}} a thriller, love story, and mystery with {{an element of}} science fiction. Unlike other well known series of the same genre, {{producers}} had promised timely answers to mysteries, with some answers provided {{as early as the}} upcoming episode. Executive producer Evan Katz stated that [...] "everything is designed to answer questions so you're not frustrated or feeling like we're making it <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> go along" [...] and the writers intended to keep the viewers guessing in a [...] "fair way." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Massimo Pigliucci on the Rationally Thinking podcast, Baggott stated that science is a human endeavor with a [...] "fuzziness around the edges".

[...] "We kinda make it <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> go along... and it is perfectly reasonable for the scientific community to want to change those rules." [...] Science writer Philip Ball, in a review of Farewell in The Guardian, stated that Baggott was right [...] "although his target is as much the way this science is marketed as what it contains." [...] Ball cautioned Baggott about criticising scientists that speculate because [...] "conjecture injects vitality into science." ...|$|E
