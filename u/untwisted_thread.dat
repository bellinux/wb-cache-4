40|$|Offered {{have been}} the {{characteristics}} for the complex evaluation of the threads binding. The methods and the testing equipment {{have been developed for}} the determination of indicators of the threads binding at twisting, with the separation of the moving thread, under the conditions of the different forms of couple of the elementary threads with the fluid. The quantitative criterion of separation in strands of the threds to be glued with the oiler has been developed. The mathematical equations, describing the process of separation of the complex <b>untwisted</b> <b>thread,</b> the experimental dependences of variation of the thread binding indicators in the course of drying have been obtained.

40|$|Context. For {{investigating}} spicules {{from the}} photosphere to coronal heights, the new Hinode/SOT {{long series of}} high resolution observations from Space taken in CaII H line emission offers an improved {{way to look at}} their remarkable dynamical behavior using images free of seeing effects. They should be put {{in the context of the}} huge amount of already accumulated material from ground-based instruments, including high- resolution spectra of off-limb spicules. Results. The surge-like behavior of solar polar region spicules supports the untwisting multi-component interpretation of spicules exhibiting helical dynamics. Several tall spicules are found with (i) upward and downward flows similar at lower and middle-levels, the rate of upward motion being slightly higher at high levels; (ii) the left and right-hand velocities are also increasing with height; (iii) a large number of multi-component spicules show shearing motion of both left-handed and right-handed senses occurring simultaneously, which might be understood as twisting (or <b>untwisting)</b> <b>threads.</b> The number of turns depends on the overall diameter of the structure made of components and changes from at least one turn for the smallest structure to at most two or three turns for surge-like broad structures; the curvature along the spicule corresponds to a low turn number similar to a transverse kink mode oscillation along the threads.

60|$|I {{had joined}} the party, and had a moment's leisure to examine them before the echo of Ethan's blast {{returned}} from the hill. Not one, but many echoes had caught up the harsh and tuneless sound, <b>untwisted</b> its complicated <b>threads,</b> and found a thousand aerial harmonies in one stern trumpet-tone. It was a distinct yet distant and dream-like symphony of melodious instruments, as if an airy band had been hidden on the hillside and made faint music at the summons. No subsequent trial produced so clear, delicate, and spiritual a concert as the first. A field-piece was then discharged {{from the top of}} a neighboring hill, and gave birth to one long reverberation, which ran round the circle of mountains in an unbroken chain of sound and rolled away without a separate echo. After these experiments, the cold atmosphere drove us all into the house, with the keenest appetites for supper.|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} chromospheric jet lasting {{for more than}} 1 hr {{observed}} by Hinode Solar Optical Telescope in unprecedented detail. The ejection occurred in three episodes separated by 12 - 14 min, with the amount and velocity of material decreasing with time. The upward velocities range from 438 to 33 km/s, while the downward velocities of the material falling back have smaller values (mean: - 56 km/s) and a narrower distribution (standard deviation: 14 km/s). The average acceleration inferred from parabolic space-time tracks is 141 m/s^ 2, {{a fraction of the}} solar gravitational acceleration. The jet consists of fine threads (0. 5 - 2. 0 arcsec wide), which exhibit coherent, oscillatory transverse motions perpendicular to the jet axis and about a common equilibrium position. These motions propagate upward along the jet, with the maximum phase speed of 744 +/- 11 km/s at the leading front of the jet. The transverse oscillation velocities range from 151 to 26 km/s, amplitudes from 6. 0 to 1. 9 Mm, and periods from 250 to 536 s. The oscillations slow down with time and cease when the material starts to fall back. The falling material travels along almost straight lines in the original direction of ascent, showing no transverse motions. These observations are consistent with the scenario that the jet involves <b>untwisting</b> helical <b>threads,</b> which rotate about the axis of a single large cylinder and shed magnetic helicity into the upper atmosphere.

5000|$|Older designs, {{especially}} {{through the}} early 1900s, tend to use fine white or ivory thread (50 to 100 widths to the inch) and intricate designs. Often they were constructed of small pieces 10 cm or less in diameter, which were then tied to each other to form a larger piece â€” a shawl, veil or umbrella, for example. This thread was either made of silk or a silk blend, to allow for improper stitches to be easily removed. The mercerization process strengthened cotton threads and spread their use in tatting. Newer designs from the 1920s and onward often use thicker thread {{in one or more}} colors, as well as newer joining methods, {{to reduce the number of}} thread ends to be hidden. The best thread for tatting is a [...] "hard" [...] thread that does not <b>untwist</b> readily. Cordonnet <b>thread</b> is a common tatting thread; Perl cotton is an example of a beautiful cord that is nonetheless a bit loose for tatting purposes. Some tatting designs incorporate ribbons and beads.|$|R
