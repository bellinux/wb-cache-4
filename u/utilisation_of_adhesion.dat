40|$|A {{method for}} {{detecting}} wheel slip/slide and re-adhesion control of AC traction motors in railway applications {{is presented in}} this paper. This enables a better <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> available <b>adhesion</b> and could also reduce wheel wear by reducing high creep values. With this method, the wheel-rail (roller) creepage, creep force and friction coefficient can be indirectly detected and estimated by measuring the voltage, current and speed of the AC traction motor and using an extended Kalman filter. The re-adhesion controller is designed to regulate the motor torque command according to the maximum available adhesion based on the estimated results. Simulations under different friction coefficients are carried out to test the proposed method...|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on {{energetic}} <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> biomass. It was used a qualitative research and document analysis of articles. The first part deals with the theoretical framework, therefore definitions and possibilities <b>of</b> biomass <b>utilisation.</b> The second part contains methodology, follows research and its evaluation. The first aim of this thesis is to summarize the <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> biomass as renewable energy and to distinguish positive and negative impacts <b>of</b> the <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> this source and evaluate its economic efficiency. There are several possibilities <b>of</b> <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> biomass, but {{it is necessary to}} select the suitable process and its utilisation. Based on the large number of examples from life it can be stated that it is economically efficient. The second aim is to identify main misconceptions related to <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> biomass. The main misconception is comparing the <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> solar energy, which has not left positive attitude of people to renewable energy, with <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> biomass. There are few examples of comparing photovoltaic with <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> biomass on the same level. In regard of the basic principles <b>of</b> <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> biomass, those two sources cannot be compared at all, they are not similar. Another misconception is apprehension of appropriation of land used for growing energy [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Malawi {{is among}} the five sub-sahara Africa {{presenting}} with very high maternal mortality rates, 984 per 100, 000 live. Inadequate access to and under-utilisation of quality maternal health care services {{was identified as a}} major reasons for poor health of the women in Malawi. As a response to this situation, the Malawi government initiated the implementation of skilled attendance approach to delivery of maternal health care in 2006. The main objectives {{of the study was to}} identify the patterns and determinants <b>of</b> <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> skilled attendace for maternal health care services in the catchment areas of two rural health centres in the northern part of Malawi. This study used methodological triangulation methods, quantitative study using a descriptive cross sectional survey and qualitative; semistructured interviews and observations. Results shows that, <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> maternal health care services at the study sites has improved compared to the 2004 demographic health survey reports on maternal health care service utilisation in Malawi. <b>Utilisation</b> <b>of</b> skilled care for child birth was much higher than of the other components of maternal health care services. Maternal health services at Bolero health centre seemed to be more accessible and available than at kande. Hence <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> most components of care were high at Bolero health centre. Higher odds for <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> skilled care at birth was associated with women who made atleast 4 antenatal care visit, who lived within 5 km from the health centre. Low <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> maternal health care was associated with womens’ low autonomy; women with lower levels of education, younger, married, had lower rates <b>of</b> <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> most components of maternal health care. The malawian strategy of implementing skilled attendance achieved is unique as it aims apromoting total <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> skilled care, some lessons can be learnt on how the implementation is done at Bolero health centre. However, provision of quality of care remains a challenge for Malawi. There is need for strengthening supportive supervision and human resource management systems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} is to {{describe}} the magnitude of educational inequalities in <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> general practitioner (GP) and specialist services in 9 European countries. In addition to West European countries, we have included 3 Eastern European countries: Hungary, Estonia and Latvia. To cover the gap in knowledge we pay a special attention to the magnitude of inequalities among patients with chronic conditions. Methods Data on the use of GP and specialist services were derived from national health surveys of Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, the Netherlands and Norway. For each country and education level we calculated the absolute prevalence and relative inequalities in <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> GP and specialist services. In order to account for the need for care, the results were adjusted by the measure of self-assessed health. Results People with lower education used GP services equally often in most countries (except Belgium and Germany) compared with those with a higher level of education. At the same time people with a higher education used specialist care services significantly more often in all countries, except in the Netherlands. The general pattern of educational inequalities in <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> specialist care was similar for both men and women. Inequalities in <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> specialist care were equally large in Eastern European and in Western European countries, except for Latvia where the inequalities were somewhat larger. Similarly, large inequalities were found in the <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> specialist care among patients with chronic diseases, diabetes, and hypertension. Conclusions We found large inequalities in the <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> specialist care. These inequalities were not compensated by <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> GP services.

40|$|Success of Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) {{is mostly}} {{determined}} by high <b>utilisation</b> rate <b>of</b> EAP services. However, {{there are various}} factors that contribute towards <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> EAP services in the workplace such as confidentiality, marketing and accessibility. Good and high <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> EAP services positively affects the company s bottom line, (Berry, 2010 : 1) resulting in improved productivity, low staff turnover, high employee morale, low levels of absenteeism and low {{cost of health care}} in the workplace (Brennan & Beidel, 2006 : 36). The researcher conducted a quantitative study in a waste management company using a questionnaire which was distributed to 128 selected respondents from four different depots that falls within Cluster South, referred to as Custer B in the study. The study explored factors affecting the <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> EAP services in a Waste Management Company. The results of the study proved that the success and <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> EAP services depends on various factors. Amongst the factors, awareness and marketing of EAP services were found to encourage <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> EAP by all stakeholders. Regular communication with employers was also found to promote EAP services and high utilisation rate. EAP s success and credibility was found to depend on the maintenance of confidentiality. Supervisors are the key players in implementing EAP services and are the EAP s most significant lint to the company. Support from top management was found {{to be one of the}} contributing factors in making the EAP a success through their buy-in of the programme. Other important factors that affected <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> EAP services included the physical location of EAP offices, the level of employees education, gender, and perception. Stigma and discrimination also affected <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> EAP service. It can be assumed that organisations with successful EAP services benefits through the reduction of workplace accidents and errors, lost workdays as well as increase in the morale of workers and productivity.
