40|$|We {{investigate}} the global GRAMMAR constraint over restricted classes of context free grammars like deterministic and unambiguous context-free grammars.

We also consider the class of linear grammars and give a propagator that runs in quadratic time. Finally, to demonstrate the use of linear grammars, we show that a weighted linear GRAMMAR constraint can efficiently encode the EDITDISTANCE constraint, and a conjunction of the EDITDISTANCE constraint and the REGULAR constraint...|$|R

30|$|Prattichizzo et al. [110] {{came up with}} {{a device}} to make haptic systems more wearable. The device that was {{designed}} was a fingertip haptic device. It consists of three motors, three wires, and a force feedback plate. The plate is attached to the motors through the three wires at three corners. The device provides force feedback by the motors pulling the wires and providing a force in the force plate. The force plate applies the force on the fingerpad of the user and creates a feeling of pressure and force. This is one of the smallest haptic devices and allows for <b>unrestricted</b> and <b>free</b> movement of the hands and fingers.|$|R

40|$|Since {{the famous}} Bosman {{ruling by the}} European Court of Justice in 1995 {{transfer}} fees for football players after moving to another club have become suspect as they are considered {{as an obstacle to}} the free movement of workers. However, in an <b>unrestricted</b> market <b>free</b> migration from football players will be Pareto efficient under special circumstances only. This paper shows that transfer fees can correct inefficient migration flows from small to large football leagues. Home-grown rules that prescribe that a certain proportion of the roster of players should be trained within the club are very blunt devices for restoring efficiency, and perform worse than transfer fee systems. football transfers, migration equilibrium, social welfare...|$|R
