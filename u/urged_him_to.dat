The Emperor, who spent his entire reign securing the Pragmatic Sanction, left Austria in an impoverished state, bankrupted by the recent Turkish war and the War of the Polish Succession; the treasury contained only 100,000 florins, which were claimed by his widow. The army numbered only 80,000men, most of whom had not been paid in months; they were nevertheless remarkably loyal and devoted to their new sovereign.|$|E
