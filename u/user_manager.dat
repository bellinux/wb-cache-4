50|$|Windows NT 3.1, for {{the most}} part, comes with 32-bit {{versions}} of the components featured in Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups. However, it also included applications specifically aimed at the needs of Windows NT, like the <b>User</b> <b>Manager,</b> the Performance Monitor, the Disk Administrator, the Event Viewer and the Backup application. The Advanced Server contained further, server-specific administration tools. Because Windows NT 3.1 is not DOS-based, a new 32-bit command-line processor, called CMD.EXE was included which was compatible with MS-DOS 5.0. For compatibility reasons, Windows NT 3.1 shipped with a few 16-bit applications, like Microsoft Write or EDLIN.|$|E
50|$|A roaming {{user profile}} {{must first be}} {{set up on the}} domain {{controller}} to which client computers are joined. In Windows 2000 and later versions, this is set using the Active Directory Users and Computers snap-in. Windows NT 4.0 and earlier used the <b>User</b> <b>Manager</b> for Domains program. A user profile location is set on the server and can be customized, as required. When a user logs onto a domain, the roaming user profile is downloaded from the server onto the local computer and applied. When the user logs off, the changes made to the roaming profile are transferred back to the domain controller.|$|E
50|$|Enabling roaming {{profiles}} for a workstation running Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP Professional, Windows Vista Business or Ultimate {{is done by}} specifying {{a location}} on the server where the users' profiles are located; this is done under <b>User</b> <b>Manager</b> for Domains in Windows NT 4.0 Server and Active Directory Users and Computers in Windows 2000 and later. Workstations running Windows 95, 98 or Me can also have roaming profiles, roaming profiles become available in Windows 9x when a home directory on the network is specified for the user and multiple desktop settings have been enabled under the Passwords box in the Windows Control Panel.|$|E

User stories are often written from the perspective of an end user or user of a system. They are often recorded on index cards, on Post-it notes, or in project management software. Depending on the project, user stories may be written by various stakeholders including clients, <b>users,</b> <b>managers</b> or development team members.|$|R
5000|$|To {{address the}} {{security}} weaknesses inherent in LM encryption and authentication schemes, Microsoft introduced the NTLMv1 protocol in 1993 with Windows NT 3.1. For hashing, NTLM uses Unicode support, replacing [...] by , {{which does not}} require any padding or truncating that would simplify the key. On the negative side, the same DES algorithm was used with only 56-bit encryption for the subsequent authentication steps, {{and there is still}} no salting. Furthermore, Windows machines were for many years configured by default to send and accept responses derived from both the LM hash and the NTLM hash, so the use of the NTLM hash provided no additional security while the weaker hash was still present. It also took time for artificial restrictions on password length in management tools such as <b>User</b> <b>Manager</b> to be lifted.|$|E
5000|$|The {{successor}} to Windows NT 3.51, Windows NT 4.0 introduced the user interface of Windows 95 to the Windows NT family, including the Windows shell, File Explorer (known as Windows NT Explorer at the time), {{and the use}} of [...] "My" [...] nomenclature for shell folders (e.g. My Computer). It also includes most components introduced with Windows 95. Internally, Windows NT 4.0 was known as the Shell Update Release (SUR). While many administrative tools, notably <b>User</b> <b>Manager</b> for Domains, Server Manager and Domain Name Service Manager still used the old graphical user interfaces, the Start menu in Windows NT 4.0 separated the per-user shortcuts and folders from the shared shortcuts and folders by a separator line. Windows NT 4.0 includes some enhancements from Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 such as the Space Cadet pinball table, font smoothing, showing window contents while dragging, high-color icons and stretching the wallpaper to fit the screen. Windows Desktop Update could also be installed on Windows NT 4.0 to update the shell version and install Task Scheduler. Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit included the Desktop Themes utility.|$|E

In performing the tasks, UMAS requires several sets of training data for decision-making process in which it bases on the outcomes of learning that was taken place earlier. These sets of training data that constitute a Knowledge Base (KB) are used for a supervised learning of UMAS and it consists of profile, policy and network knowledge.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an Intelligent <b>User</b> <b>Manager</b> System (UMAS) for controlling access to network resources in a Smart School network. Network resources, {{especially in a}} Smart School, {{are in short supply}} and relatively expensive to acquire, therefore a control mechanism should be in place so that available resources can be allocated for legitimate usages only. An intelligent mechanism using Fuzzy Logic is deployed for the purpose of knowledge learning in order to process all the user requests accordingly. A decision of granting a network resource request needs to be based on several data sets that represent the current network state, transmission state and users. The system is analysed and designed using the Tropos Methodology. Tropos was chosen because it covers four stages of development. The proposed system was modelled using Fuzzy Logic algorithms for simulation purposes in order to find the relationship between two fuzzy sets with the computed allocated time...|$|E
