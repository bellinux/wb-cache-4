5|$|Murray cod {{continue}} a pattern present in Murray-Darling native fish genera of speciation into lowland and specialist <b>upland</b> species: Murray cod are the primarily lowland species and the endangered trout cod are the specialist <b>upland</b> species. The pattern is slightly blurred in the cod species because, being adaptable and successful fish, Murray cod push significant distances into <b>upland</b> habitats, while the now endangered trout cod stray (or did stray, before their decline) well down the upland/lowland transition zone, {{which can be}} extensive in Murray-Darling Rivers. Nevertheless, the basic pattern of speciation into a primarily lowland species and a specialist <b>upland</b> species is present.|$|E

50|$|The Calenberg <b>Uplands</b> (Calenberger Bergland) are a {{landscape}} {{unit in the}} Weser-Leine <b>Uplands</b> in Lower Saxony, Germany. They border on the Calenberg Land {{to the north and}} merge into the Weser <b>Uplands</b> in the west and the Leine <b>Uplands</b> in the east.

5|$|Bracken is {{very common}} in <b>upland</b> areas, Beech Fern in woods and other shaded {{locations}} and Scaly Male Fern in wooded or open areas. Wilsons Filmy-fern is a common <b>upland</b> variety in the Highlands, along with the Tunbridge Filmy-fern, Alpine Lady-fern and the rarer stunted form Newman’s Lady-fern (A. distentifolium var. flexile) which is endemic to Scotland. The Killarney Fern, once found on Arran {{was thought to be}} extinct in Scotland, but has been discovered on Skye in its gametophyte form.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, Murray cod inhabit {{a remarkably}} {{wide variety of}} habitats, from cool, clear, fast-flowing streams with riffle-and-pool {{structure}} and rocky substrates in <b>upland</b> areas to large, slow flowing, meandering rivers in the extensive alluvial lowland reaches of the Murray-Darling basin.|$|E

5|$|While wintering, {{bald eagles}} {{tend to be}} less habitat and {{disturbance}} sensitive. They will commonly congregate at spots with plentiful perches and waters with plentiful prey and (in Northern climes) partially unfrozen waters. Alternately, non-breeding or wintering bald eagles, particularly in areas with a lack of human disturbance, spend their time in various <b>upland,</b> terrestrial habitats sometimes quite far away from waterways. In the northern half of North America (especially the interior portion), this terrestrial inhabitance by bald eagles tends to be especially prevalent because unfrozen water may not be accessible. <b>Upland</b> wintering habitats often consist of open habitats with concentrations of medium-sized mammals, such as prairies, meadows or tundra, or open forests with regular carrion access.|$|E

5|$|Murray cod {{have died}} out {{in many of}} their <b>upland</b> habitats, {{particularly}} in the southern Murray-Darling basin, due {{to a combination of}} overfishing, siltation, dams and weirs blocking migration, pollution from arsenic-based sheep-dips, mining, and in some cases, introduced trout stockings, which causes competition between juvenile Murray cod and introduced trout species.|$|E
