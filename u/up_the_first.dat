5|$|Claims that Stroheim's {{original}} cut was {{a completely}} unabridged version of McTeague are not accurate. Stroheim's 300-page script was {{almost as long as}} the original novel, but he rethought the entire story and invented new scenes, as well as extensively elaborating existing ones. In the Norris novel, McTeague's back story in Placer County and relationships with his father, mother and Potter were remembered as a flashback and took two paragraphs. In Stroheim's original Greed, this sequence took <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> hour of the film and was not a flashback. Stroheim also modernized the novel's time span to between 1908 and 1923, a quarter-century later than the novel.|$|E

5|$|From 1930 to 1970, the Jules Rimet Trophy {{was awarded}} to the World Cup winning team.

5|$|In 1840 a {{group of}} local {{businessmen}} led by Jonathan Richardson set <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> of several iron companies in Consett (County Durham), the Derwent Iron Company, to quarry and smelt ironstone around the town. The best local ironstone (with the highest iron content) was exhausted soon after, so the company arranged for extensions to the local railways, such as the Stockton and Darlington Railway. These allowed it to access new sources of ironstone, including, from 1851 onwards, ore from the Cleveland Ironstone Formation near Eston, Cleveland.|$|E

A headquarters company included the specialist support troops; signallers, anti-aircraft and mortar platoons, pioneers and transport as well as administrative personnel.|$|E

5|$|The {{second quarter}} began with Nebraska in {{possession}} of the ball at the Virginia Tech 11-yard line and facing a second down and needing six yards. On the first play of the quarter, Nebraska rusher Brian Schuster was tackled for a five-yard loss in a failed trick play, pushing Nebraska back to the 16-yard line. Sims rushed for eight yards on third down, but failed to pick <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> down and Nebraska sent kicker Kris Brown into the game. Brown's 25-yard field goal was successful, and Nebraska cut Virginia Tech's lead to 73 with 13:25 remaining before halftime.|$|E

5|$|After Spain sent Columbus on {{his first}} voyage to the New World in 1492, other explorers followed. The first Europeans to arrive in {{territory}} of the modern United States were Spanish conquistadors such as Juan Ponce de León, who made {{his first visit to}} Florida in 1513; however, if unincorporated territories are accounted for, then credit would go to Christopher Columbus who landed in Puerto Rico on his 1493 voyage. Spanish set <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> settlements in Florida and New Mexico such as Saint Augustine and Santa Fe. The French established their own as well along the Mississippi River. Successful English settlement on the eastern coast of North America began with the Virginia Colony in 1607 at Jamestown and the Pilgrims' Plymouth Colony in 1620. Many settlers were dissenting Christian groups who came seeking religious freedom. The continent's first elected legislative assembly, Virginia's House of Burgesses created in 1619, the Mayflower Compact, signed by the Pilgrims before disembarking, and the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut, established precedents for the pattern of representative self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies.|$|E
5|$|Against the Panthers, the Bears' defense forced three {{turnovers}} in {{the first}} half, which included a 51-yard interception return for touchdown by Jon Bostic, followed by Zack Bowman intercepting Derek Anderson and Sherrick McManis forcing Kenjon Barner to fumble; the Bears recorded {{a total of four}} takeaways in the game. However, the offense allowed seven sacks and had three turnovers, one of which was a fumble by Armando Allen. Panthers cornerback Josh Norman had two interceptions, one of which set <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> score of the game via Cam Newton's three-yard touchdown pass to Brandon LaFell early in the game. Bostic's pick-six tied up the game, followed by Robbie Gould's 35-yard field goal in the second quarter. With 18 seconds left {{in the first}} half, Carolina scored again on Kenjon Barner's 5-yard touchdown run; the Panthers scored the lone points of the third quarter after Norman intercepted Matt Blanchard, scoring on the 60-yard return. Though the Bears retaliated after Blanchard threw a 58-yard pass to Marquess Wilson to Carolina's 4-yard line, followed by Michael Ford's touchdown run, Graham Gano's 50-yard field goal was the final score of the game, as the Panthers triumphed 24–17.|$|E
5|$|As White had {{expected}} the survivors to {{fight their way}} out of Ngok Tavak, he made the decision to leave the dead allied soldiers behind; the decision caused distress amongst the survivors of the battle, but White believed evacuating the deceased soldiers through enemy lines would have been suicidal. After the Marines and Mobile Strike Force personnel had destroyed their unneeded equipment, they were directed to form an order-of-march out of Ngok Tavak, {{in order to protect the}} wounded and those with little infantry experience. Just before they left the garrison, Cameron blew <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> CH-46 helicopter that was still intact on the landing zone, using the M-72 anti-tank weapon. The order-of-march was led by a group of Nung soldiers, who were followed by White and the survivors of the Marine artillery detachment, and behind them was another group of Nung soldiers covering the tail of the column. Together they evaded VC formations surrounding the hill feature of Ngok Tavak and marched eastward towards Khâm Đức.|$|E
