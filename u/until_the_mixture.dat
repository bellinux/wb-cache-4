5|$|In Mexico, hot {{chocolate}} remains a popular national drink, often including semi-sweet chocolate, cinnamon, sugar, and vanilla. Hot chocolate {{of this type}} is commonly sold in circular or hexagonal tablets which can be dissolved into hot milk, water, or cream, and then blended <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> develops a creamy froth. A 1942 article in the Chicago Tribune describes Mexican cinnamon {{hot chocolate}} as being traditionally served alongside a variety of sweet Mexican pastries, such as pan dulce or churros.|$|E
25|$|Heating {{an ideal}} mixture of two {{volatile}} substances A and B (with A having the higher volatility, or lower boiling point) in a batch distillation setup (such as in an apparatus {{depicted in the}} opening figure) <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> is boiling results in a vapor above the liquid which contains a mixture of A and B. The ratio between A and B in the vapor will {{be different from the}} ratio in the liquid: the ratio in the liquid will be determined by how the original mixture was prepared, while the ratio in the vapor will be enriched in the more volatile compound, A (due to Raoult's Law, see above). The vapor goes through the condenser and is removed from the system. This in turn means that the ratio of compounds in the remaining liquid is now different from the initial ratio (i.e., more enriched in B than the starting liquid).|$|E
25|$|The Nivkh had {{a diverse}} diet being semi-sedentary before colonization. Fish {{was the main}} source of food for the Nivkh, {{including}} pink, Pacific, and chum salmon as well as trout, Red Eye, burbot and pike found in rivers and streams. Salt water fishing provided saffron cod, flatfish, and marine goby caught in the littoral coasts of the Strait of Tartary, Sea of Okhotsk, and the Pacific Ocean, though over fishing by Russian and Japanese trawlers have depleted many of these fish stocks. Additionally, industrial pollution such as phenols and heavy metals in the Amur River have devastated fish stocks and damaged the soil of the estuaries. A traditional preservation process called Yukola, involving slicing the fish in a particular way and drying the strips by hanging them in the frigid air, without salt, was used before foreign influences. The preservation process created a lot of dried fish waste, unpalatable for human consumption but utilized for dog food. Pulverizing dried fish and mixing it with fish skins, water, seal fat, and berries <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> had a sour cream consistency is a favorite Nivkh dish called mos. Nivkhs would hunt seal (Larha, Reinged, Reibbon, Sea-lions), duck, sable, and otters. They would gather various berries, wild leeks, lilybulbs, and nuts. Contacts with the Chinese, Manchu, and Japanese from the 12th century on introduced new foods incorporated in the Nivkhs diet such as salt, sugar, rice, millet, legumes and tea. Russian 19th century colonisation introduced flour, bread, potatoes, vodka, tobacco, butter, canned vegetables and fruits, and other meats.|$|E
50|$|As in HCSI, HCCI injects fuel {{during the}} intake stroke. However, {{rather than using}} an {{electric}} discharge (spark) to ignite a portion of <b>the</b> <b>mixture,</b> HCCI raises density and temperature by compression <b>until</b> <b>the</b> entire <b>mixture</b> reacts spontaneously.|$|R
50|$|Pottage was {{typically}} boiled {{for several hours}} <b>until</b> <b>the</b> entire <b>mixture</b> took on a homogeneous texture and flavour; this was intended to break down complex starches and to ensure the food was safe for consumption. It was often served, when possible, with bread.|$|R
50|$|Depending {{from the}} metals in excess, {{compared}} with the eutectic, crystals are formed, depleting <b>the</b> liquid, <b>until</b> <b>the</b> eutectic 4/12 <b>mixture</b> is formed once more.|$|R
2500|$|The Alaskan Athabaskan Indian ice-cream (Lower Tanana nonathdlodi Tanacross nanehdlaad) is dessert-like dry meat {{mixed with}} moose fat and {{different}} from the Canadian Indian ice cream of First Nations in British Columbia. One recipe for Indian ice cream consisted of dried and pulverized tenderloin that was blended with moose grease in a birch bark container <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> was light and fluffy. In addition, however, Alaskan Athabaskan communities also create songs for performance at potlatches: dance songs, potlatch songs and mourning songs. Within stories and embedded in fragments of folklore, old shamanic songs are also partially remembered; they are called [...] "ice‐cream songs" [...] because {{they used to be}} sung during the preparation of nonathdlodi, or [...] "Indian ice cream." ...|$|E

50|$|A common {{method of}} cooking oatmeal in Scotland is to soak it {{overnight}} in salted water {{and cook on}} a low heat {{in the morning for}} a few minutes <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> thickens.|$|E
50|$|There is some {{suggestion}} that Welsh Rabbit derives from a South Wales Valleys staple, {{in which a}} generous lump of cheese is placed into a mixture of beaten eggs and milk, seasoned with salt and pepper, and baked in <b>the</b> oven <b>until</b> <b>the</b> egg <b>mixture</b> has firmed and the cheese has melted. Onion may be added and <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> would be eaten with bread and butter and occasionally with the vinegar from pickled beetroot.|$|R
50|$|The {{corn flour}} and the crumbled cheese {{are put in}} a container, {{moistening}} this <b>mixture</b> with <b>the</b> fat broth <b>until</b> it is <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> from which <b>the</b> little balls are made.|$|R
50|$|After the ore is crushed into a fine powder, it's lightly panned {{to leave}} only the {{heaviest}} minerals in the pan. It's then thoroughly mixed by three times (by volume) {{as much of}} borax and {{a few drops of}} water.

40|$|We use the Bogoliubov-de Gennes {{formalism}} {{to analyze}} the ground state phases of harmonically trapped two-species fermion mixtures with unequal masses. In the weakly attracting limit and around unitarity, {{we find that the}} superfluid order parameter is spatially modulated around the trap center, and that its global maximum occurs at a finite distance away from the trap center where <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> is locally unpolarized. As the attraction strength increases towards the molecular limit, the spatial modulations gradually disappear while the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) type nonmodulated superfluid region expands <b>until</b> <b>the</b> entire <b>mixture</b> becomes locally unpolarized.

50|$|A {{flooded engine}} is an {{internal}} combustion engine that has been fed an excessively rich air-fuel mixture that cannot be ignited. This is caused by <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> exceeding <b>the</b> upper explosive limit for the particular fuel. An engine in this condition will not start <b>until</b> <b>the</b> excessively rich <b>mixture</b> has been cleared. It is also possible for an engine to stall from a running state due to this condition.|$|R
50|$|Frico (in {{original}} friulian language fricò) is {{a typical}} dish of Friuli and similar to another Alpine dish, Rösti, which consists of a wafer of shredded cheese and potatoes, then heated by baking or frying <b>until</b> crisp. <b>The</b> <b>mixture</b> becomes malleable during cooking. To prepare frico you need higher-fat hard cheeses like Montasio or Asiago. Originally when Friuli was a more impoverished country, frico was used to recycle cheese rinds. Frico is often used as garnish for soups or stews.|$|R
50|$|In this configuration, {{the flame}} is {{typically}} initiated {{by way of}} a spark within a homogeneous pre-mixture. The subsequent propagation of the developed premixed flame occurs as a spherical front <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> is transformed entirely or the walls of the combustion vessel are reached.|$|E
50|$|Kabab Koobideh contains: ground meat, onion, salt, pepper, turmeric, and seasoning. These {{ingredients}} are mixed together <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> becomes smooth and sticky. One egg {{is added to}} help the mix stick together. The mixture is then pressed around a skewer. Koobideh Kabab is typically 7 to- 8 in long.|$|E
50|$|Tapenade's base {{ingredient}} is olive. The olives (most commonly black olive) and capers are finely chopped, crushed or blended. Olive oil is {{then added}} <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> becomes a paste. Tapenade is often flavoured differently in varying regions with other ingredients such as garlic, herbs, anchovies, lemon juice or brandy.|$|E
50|$|Active Growth Stage = When {{in active}} growth and {{in full sun}} exposure, water <b>until</b> <b>the</b> soil <b>mixture</b> is drenched; <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> should drain freely. Often the top most roots will become exposed near the stem, but the plant seems not to mind this and it may give the overall {{appearance}} more interest. Always allow <b>the</b> potting <b>mixture</b> to dry out before re-watering. As the days begin to cool and shorten, allow longer periods between watering. If kept too wet the leaves will turn yellow and drop, eventually leading {{to the death of}} the vine. If too dry, the leaves will lose their gloss and will start to wilt, again ending in death. If noticed in time, a quick watering will often revive the plant.|$|R
50|$|Because primers are {{designed}} to have low complementarity to each other, they may anneal (step I in the figure) only at low temperature, e.g. room temperature, such as during the preparation of <b>the</b> reaction <b>mixture.</b> Although DNA polymerases used in PCR are most active around 70 °C, they have some polymerizing activity also at lower temperatures, which can cause DNA synthesis from primers after annealing to each other. Several methods {{have been developed to}} prevent PDs formation <b>until</b> <b>the</b> reaction reaches working temperature (60-70 °C), and these include initial inhibition of the DNA polymerase, or physical separation of reaction components reaction <b>until</b> <b>the</b> reaction <b>mixture</b> reaches <b>the</b> higher temperatures. These methods are referred to as hot-start PCR.|$|R
50|$|There are red as well {{as white}} Gespritzter, though <b>until</b> <b>the</b> 1980s only <b>mixtures</b> with white wine were served in rural areas. Normally no special grape variety is specified, in {{practice}} only tablewines are used. Most often Roter Veltiner (white grape variety) or Zweigelt (red grape variety) is used.|$|R
50|$|Mix {{turmeric}} {{powder and}} water in a small a small sauce pan and mix well. Turn the heat to low medium and stir constantly <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> is a thick paste. This does not take long so don’t {{walk away from the}} pan. Once it is a paste add pepper and oil.|$|E
50|$|The pulp is then boiled {{in water}} along with panela, or refined sugar, at a low {{temperature}} for several hours <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> has a thick consistency. The liquid is left to cool off to make it be moulded into blocks. It gets its characteristic firm texture once it is fully cooled.|$|E
50|$|Add 1 ml of {{concentrated}} HNO3 to 1 ml of {{the test}} sample. Heat the mixture and cool it. Slowly add sodium hydroxide (40% w/v in water) solution <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> becomes alkaline and a colour change is noted. If the colour changes from yellow to orange, this indicates {{the presence of an}} aromatic amino acid.|$|E
30|$|Five hundred milliliters of this {{filtered}} {{solution was}} used as inoculum precursor to the next SSF process with 500  g new water melon wastes, which were placed in a polyethene bottle. The precursor will increase the rate of fermentation, which minimizes the duration of SSF process. The bottle was then placed {{in a room with}} temperature of 298  K <b>until</b> <b>the</b> fermented <b>mixture</b> is soluble. This soluble product was filtered with the fabricated filter (not shown here). This filtered solution is called second batch water melon biofertilizer.|$|R
50|$|HBr is {{very soluble}} in water, forming hydrobromic acid solution, which is {{saturated}} at 68.85% HBr by weight at room temperature. Aqueous solutions that are 47.6% HBr by weight form a constant-boiling azeotrope mixture that boils at 124.3 °C. Boiling less concentrated solutions releases H2O <b>until</b> <b>the</b> constant boiling <b>mixture</b> composition is reached.|$|R
50|$|In a {{large bowl}} add flour and yeast and mix. Then, add salt and sugar, egg and water <b>until</b> you get <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> to dough consistency. Leave to stand for {{about half an hour}} <b>until</b> <b>the</b> dough sets. Once the dough has doubled in size, pinch {{medium-sized}} pieces of dough in any shape you like and place in a pan with a good amount of oil, usually filled to half to <b>the</b> top. Fry <b>until</b> just golden brown. Place on paper towel to dry excess oil.|$|R
5000|$|Contemporary tofu {{manufacturers}} {{may choose}} to use {{one or more of}} these coagulants, since each plays a role in producing a desired texture in the finished tofu. [...] Different textures result from different pore sizes and other microscopic features in tofu produced using each coagulant. The coagulant mixture is dissolved into water, and the solution is then stirred into boiled soy milk <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> curdles into a soft gel.|$|E

The sauce is prepared by cooking the ingredients <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> reduces and thickens. This garnish is served with meat such as veal, poultry and sometimes eggs.|$|E
3000|$|... mPEG-PLA diblock {{copolymers}} were synthesized from d,l-dilactide and mPEG using stannous 2 -ethylhexanoateas as {{a catalyst}} as described previously [19] with modification. Briefly, d,l-dilactide was recrystallized in ethyl acetate at room temperature <b>until</b> <b>the</b> racemic <b>mixture</b> melting point was attained (124 – 126 °C), and mPEG was used without further purification. The synthesized diblock copolymers were referred to as mPEGx-PLAy. x and y represented the weight-averaged molecular weight of the mPEG and PLA block in kDa. mPEG 5 -PLA 2.5, for example, consisted of a 5 kDa mPEG block connected to a 2.5 kDa PLA block.|$|R
5000|$|A short {{dough is}} one that is crumbly or mealy. The {{opposite}} of a short dough is a [...] "long" [...] dough or dough that stretches. Vegetable shortening (or butter, or other solid fats) can produce both types of dough; the difference is in technique. To produce a short dough, which is commonly used for tarts, the shortening is cut into the flour with a pastry blender, pair of table knives, fingers, or other utensil <b>until</b> <b>the</b> resulting <b>mixture</b> has a fine, cornmeal-like texture. For a long dough, the shortening is cut in only <b>until</b> <b>the</b> pea-sized crumbs are formed, or even larger lumps may be included. After cutting in the fat, the liquid (if any) is added and the dough is shaped for baking.|$|R
5|$|In India carrots {{are used}} {{in a variety of}} ways, as salads or as {{vegetables}} added to spicy rice or dal dishes. A popular variation in north India is the Gajar Ka Halwa carrot dessert, which has carrots grated and cooked in milk <b>until</b> <b>the</b> whole <b>mixture</b> is solid, after which nuts and butter are added. Carrot salads are usually made with grated carrots with a seasoning of mustard seeds and green chillies popped in hot oil. Carrots can also be cut in thin strips and added to rice, can form part of a dish of mixed roast vegetables or can be blended with tamarind to make chutney.|$|R
