40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{evidence}} the current state of non-interconnected zones (ZNI) in Colombia, in terms of the offer of energy, regulation and institutional structure, in order to determine the incentives that seek to implement efficient solutions for these zones. For this purpose, there is on the one hand an analysis of the structure of offer in the non-interconnected zones, and regulation of costs and tariffs applicable; and on the other, incentives given in the law for potential suppliers. Among these incentives, we identify and simulate the feasibility of creating <b>umbrella</b> <b>projects,</b> in the context of clean development mechanisms. The conclusion is that the institutional structure and incentives now in place have not been effective in these areas, and there are no clear or strong strategies to take advantage of their potential to generate electricity with alternative sources and make use of clean development mechanisms.

40|$|The {{advancement}} of neuroscience, {{perhaps one of}} the most information rich disciplines of all the life sciences, requires basic frameworks for organizing the vast amounts of data generated by the research community to promote novel insights and integrated understanding. Since Cajal, the neuron remains a fundamental unit of the nervous system, yet even with the explosion of information technology, we still have few comprehensive or systematic strategies for aggregating cell-level knowledge. Progress toward this goal is hampered by the multiplicity of names for cells and by lack of a consensus on the criteria for defining neuron types. However, through <b>umbrella</b> <b>projects</b> like the Neuroscience Information Framework (NIF) and the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF), we have the opportunity to propose and implement an informatics infrastructure for establishing common tools and approaches to describe neurons through a standard terminology for nerve cells and a database (a Neuron Registry) where these descriptions can be deposited and compared. This article provides an overview of the problem and outlines a solution approach utilizing ontological characterizations. Based on illustrative implementation examples, we also discuss the need for consensus criteria to be adopted by the research community, and considerations on future developments. A scalable repository of neuron types will provide researchers with a resource that materially contributes to the {{advancement of}} neuroscience...|$|R
