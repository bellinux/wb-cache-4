40|$|An MDU-Liulin {{spectrometer}} {{based on}} an Si-diode was mainly used {{during the last few}} years with the goal to use them for measurements <b>onboard</b> <b>aircraft.</b> To investigate its ability to obtain such measurements, the detector was tested in some radiation reference fields, like /sup 60 /Co and other photon beams, neutrons of an AmBe and /sup 252 /Cf sources and in high-energy radiation fields at CERN.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of the exposure to cosmic radiation <b>onboard</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{is one of the}} preoccupations of bodies responsible for radiation protection.

Results are provided for periods close to solar maximum and minimum and for selected flights covering major commercial routes in the world. The overall agreement between the codes, particularly for those routinely used for aircraft crew dosimetry, was better than ± 20 % from the median in all but two cases.

40|$|Aircrew {{members are}} exposed to {{ionizing}} radiation due to their work <b>onboard</b> <b>aircraft.</b> ICRP recommended the monitoring of their effective doses because they regularly exceed the limit of 1 mSv per year for the public exposure. The effective doses are routinely calculated by computer codes that take into account flight parameters like altitude, geographic position, and solar activity. This approach was preferred against personal dosimeters method because the effective dose cannot be evaluated experimentally. However, it is generally accepted, that these calculations should be periodically verified by measurements of H*(10) which is frequently used as a surrogate for effective dose. This report refers about the database (available online [URL] similar to aircraft/) of long-term measurements with the silicon spectrometer Liulin <b>onboard</b> <b>aircraft.</b> The measurements have been performed since March 2001; so up to date, the database covers a period of 11 -years (with a few interruptions) which is usually {{the duration of the}} whole solar cycle. The database comprises more than 10 (5) individual records of energy deposition spectra, absorbed dose rates, and ambient dose equivalent rates. Each record contains also the information on all flight parameters needed for calculation of dosimetric quantities by the computer codes, and thus the database represent an useful tool for verification of the routine dosimetry of aircraft crews.
