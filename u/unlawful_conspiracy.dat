2500|$|The longstanding feud between chiropractors {{and medical}} doctors {{continued}} for decades. The AMA labeled chiropractic an [...] "unscientific cult" [...] in 1966, and until 1980 held {{that it was}} unethical for medical doctors to associate with [...] "unscientific practitioners". In 1975, an anonymous AMA insider describing himself as a disgruntled AMA staffer and identifying himself as [...] "Sore Throat" [...] released information concerning the Committee on Quackery and its proposed methods to eliminate chiropractic to the press. These papers were the basis of Wilk et al. vs. AMA, the suit brought by Chester Wilk, D.C., of Illinois and five co-plaintiffs against the AMA and several co-defendants. After two trials, on September 25, 1987, Getzendanner issued her opinion that the AMA had violated Section 1, but not 2, of the Sherman Act, {{and that it had}} engaged in an <b>unlawful</b> <b>conspiracy</b> in restraint of trade [...] "to contain and eliminate the chiropractic profession." [...] (Wilk v. American Medical Ass'n, 671F. Supp. 1465, N.D. Ill. 1987).|$|E
2500|$|Since its inception, {{chiropractic}} was controversial {{amongst the}} established medical orthodoxy. Chiropractors were jailed for [...] "practicing medicine without a license" [...] which the profession designed a {{legal and political}} defence against prosecution arguing that chiropractic was [...] "separate and distinct from medicine", asserting that chiropractors [...] "analyzed" [...] rather than [...] "diagnosed", and [...] "adjusted" [...] subluxations rather than [...] "treated" [...] disease. In 1963 the American Medical Association formed a [...] "Committee on Quackery" [...] designed to [...] "contain and eliminate" [...] the chiropractic profession. In 1966, the AMA referred to chiropractic an [...] "unscientific cult" [...] and until 1980 and held that it was unethical for medical doctors to associate themselves with [...] "unscientific practitioners". Then in 1987, the AMA {{was found to have}} engaged in an <b>unlawful</b> <b>conspiracy</b> in restraint of trade [...] "to contain and eliminate the chiropractic profession." [...] In the 1980s, spinal manipulation gained mainstream recognition and has spurred ongoing collaboration into research of manipulative therapies and models of delivery of chiropractic care for musculoskeletal conditions in the mainstream healthcare sector.|$|E

The tenants of a given estate agreed with one another what abatement they thought just in the current half-year’s rent. This in a body they proffered to landlord or agent. If it was refused as payment in full, they handed the money to a managing committee, and the committee deposited it with some person in whom they had confidence, to be used for the purpose of the struggle.(225) That such proceeding constituted an <b>unlawful</b> <b>conspiracy</b> nobody doubts, any more than it can be doubted that before the Act of 1875 every trade combination of a like kind in this island was a conspiracy.|$|E

40|$|In {{this essay}} I try to {{ascertain}} whether there is any normative or doctrinal foundation for the extended joint enterprise doctrine.

All the cases concerning common purpose complicity scenarios where unlawfulness has been an issue hinge on the doctrine of constructive crime, so I try to show {{that those who are}} invoking that doctrine of unlawfulness to support their normative case for extended joint enterprise liability are working from a mistaken doctrinal premise, because the doctrine of constructive crime {{in the development of the}} law of complicity was limited to homicides; whereas complicity’s doctrine of common intent applied to all unlawful joint enterprises. Furthermore, it is contended that <b>unlawful</b> agreements (<b>conspiracies)</b> in themselves do not supply a normative justification for this sort of complicity, even when the agreement is consummated, because the accessory does not take an equal normative position in an unintended collateral crime that is merely foreseen as a possibility...|$|R
