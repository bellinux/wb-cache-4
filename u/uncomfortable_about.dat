5|$|Reginald Tate, who {{had played}} the title role in The Quatermass Experiment, {{collapsed}} and died on 23 August 1955, aged 58. This {{was less than a}} month before the shooting of the location filming for Quatermass II began, and necessitated the casting of a replacement lead actor at short notice; John Robinson was chosen to fill the part. Robinson was an experienced actor from a range of different films and television programmes since the 1930s, but was <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>about</b> taking over from Tate, and had difficulty in learning some of the technical dialogue he was required to deliver. Robinson's delivery of his lines has been criticised by some later reviewers.|$|E

Obayashi described the attitude on the set as very upbeat as he often skipped, sang and played quiz games with the younger actresses on the set. Despite having fun on the set, members of the Toho crew felt the film was nonsense. Obayashi found the acting of the seven girls to be poor while trying to direct them verbally. He began playing the film's soundtrack on set, which changed the way the girls were acting in the film as they got into the spirit of the music. Actress Kimiko Ikegami was <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>about</b> a nude scene in the film. To make her more comfortable, Yoko Minamida also took off her clothes. After Obayashi saw Minamida nude, he included a nude scene for her in the film which was not in the original script.|$|E

40|$|This paper explores {{two stories}} of the author’s own family, one of post-Second World War Displaced Persons, and one of Nazi collaboration. Juxtaposed, these two stories {{attached}} to one familial identity throw into relief the expectations of victimhood and responsibility encoded in stereotypical refugee narratives. The paper tracks such expectations in contemporary Australian refugee debate, showing that essentialised equations between refugees and victimhood {{can be used to}} obscure, rather than expose, relations of power and violence. The <b>uncomfortable</b> revelations <b>about</b> my own family that I canvass here can thus be understood as a synecdoche for <b>uncomfortable</b> truths <b>about</b> Australia’s history in relation to refugees, both past and present. Attending to these truths requires being prepared to disrupt ‘familiar’ narratives of victimhood and perpetration, and remember our own potential affiliations with violence, whether personal or national.
