40|$|ConocoPhillips, in {{conjunction}} with Nexant Inc., Penn State University, and Cummins Engine Co., joined with the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) in a cooperative agreement to perform a comprehensive study of new <b>ultra</b> <b>clean</b> fuels (UCFs) produced from remote sources of natural gas. The project study consists of three primary tasks: an environmental Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), a Market Study, {{and a series of}} Engine Tests to evaluate the potential markets for <b>Ultra</b> <b>Clean</b> Fuels. The overall objective of DOE's <b>Ultra</b> <b>Clean</b> Transportation Fuels Initiative is to develop and deploy technologies that will produce ultra-clean burning transportation fuels for the 21 st century from both petroleum and non-petroleum resources. These fuels will: (1) Enable vehicles to comply with future emission requirements; (2) Be compatible with the existing liquid fuels infrastructure; (3) Enable vehicle efficiencies to be significantly increased, with concomitantly reduced CO{sub 2 } emissions; (4) Be obtainable from a fossil resource, alone or in combination with other hydrocarbon materials such as refinery wastes, municipal wastes, biomass, and coal; and (5) Be competitive with current petroleum fuels. The objectives of the ConocoPhillips <b>Ultra</b> <b>Clean</b> Fuels Project are to perform a comprehensive life cycle analysis and to conduct a market study on <b>ultra</b> <b>clean</b> fuels of commercial interest produced from natural gas, and, in addition, perform engine tests for Fisher-Tropsch diesel and methanol in neat, blended or special formulations to obtain data on emissions. This resulting data will be used to optimize fuel compositions and engine operation in order to minimize the release of atmospheric pollutants resulting from the fuel combustion. Development and testing of both direct and indirect methanol fuel cells was to be conducted and the optimum properties of a suitable fuel-grade methanol was to be defined. The results of the study are also applicable to coal-derived FT liquid fuels. After different gas clean up processes steps, the coal-derived syngas will produce FT liquid fuels that have similar properties to natural gas derived FT liquids...|$|R

40|$|The {{manufacture}} of hydrogen from {{natural gas is}} essential for the production of <b>ultra</b> <b>clean</b> transportation fuels. Not only is hydrogen necessary to upgrade low quality crude oils to high-quality, low sulfur <b>ultra</b> <b>clean</b> transportation fuels, hydrogen could eventually replace gasoline and diesel as the <b>ultra</b> <b>clean</b> transportation fuel of the future. Currently, refinery hydrogen is produced through the steam reforming of natural gas. Although efficient, the process is responsible for a significant portion of refinery CO 2 emissions. This project is examining the direct catalytic decomposition of methane as an alternative to steam reforming. The energy required to produce one mole of hydrogen is slightly lower and the process does not require water-gas-shift or pressure-swing adsorption units. The decomposition process does not produce CO 2 emissions and the product is not contaminated with CO [...] a poison for PEM fuel cells. In this work we examined the direct catalytic decomposition of methane over a metal modified zeolite catalyst and the recovery of catalyst activity by calcination. A favorable production of hydrogen was obtained, when compared with previously reported nickel-zeolite supported catalysts. Reaction temperature had a strong influence on catalyst activity and on the type of carbon deposits. The catalyst utilized at 873 and 973 K could be regenerated without any significant loss of activity, however the catalyst utilized at 1073 K showed some loss of activity after regeneration...|$|R

40|$|A {{frequent}} problem {{within the}} textile conservation field {{is the need}} to wash artefacts which are not made for washing. This thesis identifies the problems often encountered during wet cleaning in regard to dyes and colours with poor wash-fastness. A literature study pinpoints which dyes and dyeing techniques frequently yields poor wash-fastness results and looks at some possible techniques used currently and in the past to solve the problem. The properties and history of cyklododecane is presented, and its possible use in textile conservation in a melted state as a single isolating agent is explored, as well as in combination with Paraloid B 72 in the dual-layer technique designed by Salvador Muñoz- Viñas for paper conservation. The workings of <b>ultra</b> <b>clean</b> water is explained. Different dye techniques were used to produce yarn with intentional poor wash-fastness; reactive dye, water soluble ink, saffron and vat dye. Samples were prepared, embroidery on cotton, and then subjected to different treatments: a) water (control), b) water + detergent (Berol 784) (control), c) cyclododecane + water + detergent, d) cyclododecane + paraloid b 72 + water + detergent and e) <b>ultra</b> <b>clean</b> water, with one set of samples left untreated. Blotting papers were used to control the bleeding. The results were analysed in a microscope, and documented via photography. The outcomes were compared to one another and the results considered. No method worked to produce a 100 % satisfactory result, but the best of them were the dual layer technique with several layers of both CDD and PB 72, which yielded none to minimal bleeding.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{systematic}} {{experimental studies of}} the temperature dependence of the resistivity {{in a variety of}} dilute, <b>ultra</b> <b>clean</b> two dimensional electron/hole systems have revived the fundamental question of localization or, alternatively, the existence of a metal-insulator transition in the presence of strong electron-electron interactions in two dimensions. We argue that under the extreme conditions of <b>ultra</b> <b>clean</b> systems not only is the electron-electron interaction very strong but the role of other system specific properties are also enhanced. In particular, we emphasize the role of valleys in determining the transport properties of the dilute electron gas in silicon inversion layers (Si-MOSFETs). It is shown that for a high quality sample the temperature behavior of the resistivity in the region close to the critical region of the metal-insulator transition is well described by a renormalization group analysis of the interplay of interaction and disorder if the electron band is assumed to have two distinct valleys. The decrease in the resistivity up to five times has been captured in the correct temperature interval by this analysis, without involving any adjustable parameters. The considerable variance in the data obtained from different Si-MOSFET samples is attributed to the sample dependent scattering rate across the two valleys, presenting thereby with a possible explanation for the absence of universal behavior in Si-MOSFET samples of different quality...|$|R
40|$|There {{are several}} methods for growing single {{crystalline}} thin layers: {{chemical vapour deposition}} (CVD), laser ablation (LA), and physical vapour deposition (PVD). Examples for PVD of films are thermal processes (molecular beam epitaxy: MBE), and ion processes (e. g. sputtering) The main advantage of the sputter method is to enable the growth {{of high melting point}} materials, such as transition metals, oxides etc. with very stable fluxes. Especially ion beam sputtering allows an easy, nearly independent control of the sputter parameters and the growth can be influenced by an additional ion beam assisted deposition (IBAD). High quality thin layers can be prepared under <b>ultra</b> <b>clean</b> conditions (fig. 1) und ultra high vacuum conditions and through the use of <b>ultra</b> <b>clean</b> sputter gases (£ 20 ppb total impurities).
