Uninodality corresponds with isogonality in geometry and vertex-transitivity in graph theory, and produces examples objective structures. A crystal net is binodal if it has two orbits of vertex; crystals with binodal crystal nets include boracite and anatase.

The crystal structures have been solved, refined and characterized by synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction, neutron powder diffraction and solid-state DFT calculations. Minimal energies of ordered models corroborate crystal symmetries retrieved from diffraction data. The layered Li–Mg substructure forms negatively charged <b>uninodal</b> 4 -connected networks. It is shown that this connectivity cannot generate the long sought-after, bimetallic Li–Mg borohydrides without countercations when assuming preferred coordination polyhedra as found in Mg(BH 4) 2 and LiBH 4. The general properties of the trimetallic compound series are analogous with the anhydrous aluminosilicates. Additionally, a relationship with zeolites is suggested, which are built from three-dimensional Al–Si–O networks with a negative charge on them. The ternary metal borohydride systems are of interest due to their potential as novel hydridic frameworks and will allow exploration of the structural chemistry of light-metal systems otherwise subject to eutectic melting...|$|E

The HgII ion lies on a site of 1 symmetry and the apym ligand lies on sites of m symmetry with the mirror plane perpendicular to the pyrimidine plane and passing through the NH 2 group N atom.

The Zn(II) node together with the four surrounding coordinated ligands form a typical T-shaped molecular bilayer motif, which is rarely reported previously. Their X-ray powder diffraction pattems were then carried out to confirm the validity of the crystal structures. In addition, the luminescent properties of 1 and 2 are investigated in the solid state at room temperature, and the thermogravimetric analyses were carried out to study the thermal stability of the two complexes.
