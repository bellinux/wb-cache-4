5|$|A {{paramedic}} is let into a {{house to}} the sounds of panic. Earlier, the fastidious Angela prepares to host a party for the 79th birthday of her mother, Maggie. Angela's daughter, Katie, heads to her room to complete her homework. When Angela moves a cake, she reveals the head of Jim, her husband. Jim plans to play a trick on Pat—a practical joker and the husband of Angela's sister, Carol (a recovering alcoholic)—by hiding under the cake. Maggie, Carol and Pat—the latter wearing a wolf mask—arrive at the house. As the three settle, Pat plugs in his mobile to charge—something Jim had asked Angela to prevent—and secretly places ice in a bucket. Carol privately drinks from a sunscreen bottle while ostensibly <b>unblocking</b> the toilet after her mother could not flush it. Angela is proud that the party food is from Marks's, but Carol mocks Angela's middle class affectations. Maggie wants a photograph with the food on the table, and Carol lights the cake's candles, which burn towards to the flammable fake cake—under which Jim is still hiding. Katie greets her nana and aunt, with Maggie insisting that she tell the joke from Pat's card. Panicking, Angela blows out the candles. The room clears, and Jim is left frustrated.|$|E

Sherman was blocked from linking up with the U.S. Navy as he had planned, so he dispatched cavalry to Fort McAllister, guarding the Ogeechee River, in hopes of <b>unblocking</b> his route and obtaining supplies awaiting him on the Navy ships. On December 13, William B. Hazen's division of Howard's wing stormed the fort in the Battle of Fort McAllister and captured it within 15 minutes. Some of the 134 Union casualties were caused by torpedoes, a name for crude land mines that were used only rarely in the war.|$|E
500|$|Endoscopic {{retrograde}} cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is {{the most}} common approach in <b>unblocking</b> the bile duct. This involves endoscopy (passing a fiberoptic tube through the stomach into the duodenum), identification of the ampulla of Vater and insertion of a small tube into the bile duct. A sphincterotomy (making a cut in the sphincter of Oddi) is typically done to ease the flow of bile from the duct and to allow insertion of instruments to extract gallstones that are obstructing the common bile duct; alternatively or additionally, the common bile duct orifice can be dilated with a balloon. Stones may be removed either by direct suction or by using various instruments, including balloons and baskets to trawl the bile duct in order to pull stones into the duodenum. Obstructions that are caused by larger stones may require the use of an instrument known as a mechanical lithotriptor in order to crush the stone prior to removal. Obstructing stones that are too large to be removed or broken mechanically by ERCP may be managed by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. This technique uses acoustic shock waves administered outside the body to break down the stones. [...] An alternative technique to remove very large obstructing stones is electrohydraulic lithotripsy, where a small endoscope known as a cholangioscope is inserted by ERCP to directly visualize the stone. A probe uses electricity to generate shock waves that break down the obstructing stone. [...] Rarely, surgical exploration of the common bile duct (termed choledochotomy), which can be performed with laparoscopy, is required to remove the stone.|$|E
40|$|The {{records of}} a {{consecutive}} series of 920 cases of continuous lumbar epidural analgesia {{for the control}} of pain in labour were examined to ascertain the incidence of unilateral block and <b>unblocked</b> segments. An <b>unblocked</b> segment was noted to have occurred in 6. 7 per cent of patients and was persistent in 1. 5 per cent of patients. Unilateral block occurred in 1. 5 per cent of patients, being persistent in 0. 54 per cent.

2500|$|This type {{of sample}} made {{possible}} estimation of the low <b>unblocking</b> temperature. Using special equipment that measured field direction and strength at various temperatures, the experimenters raised {{the temperature of the}} sample in increments of [...] from [...] until it reached the low <b>unblocking</b> temperature. Deprived of one of its components, the overall field changed direction. A plot of direction at each increment identified the increment at which the sample's resultant magnetism had formed. That was considered to be the equilibrium temperature of the deposit. Considering the data for all the deposits of the surge arrived at a surge deposit estimate. The authors discovered that the city, Pompeii, was a relatively cool spot within a much hotter field, which they attributed to interaction of the surge with the [...] "fabric" [...] of the city.|$|E

2500|$|All crustal rock {{contains}} some iron or iron compounds, rendering it ferromagnetic, as do Roman roof tiles and plaster. These materials may acquire a residual field {{from a number}} of sources. When individual molecules, which are magnetic dipoles, are held in alignment by being bound in a crystalline structure, the small fields reinforce each other to form the rock's residual field. Heating the material adds internal energy to it. At the Curie temperature, the vibration of the molecules is sufficient to disrupt the alignment; the material loses its residual magnetism and assumes whatever magnetic field might be applied to it only {{for the duration of the}} application. The authors term this phenomenon <b>unblocking.</b> Residual magnetism is considered to [...] "block out" [...] non-residual fields.|$|E

2500|$|While the NMDAR channel itself {{displays}} {{little or}} no voltage dependence (its open channel I/V curve {{is more or less}} linear), the voltage dependence of the magnesium block effectively, if indirectly, confers voltage dependence to this channel. [...] Thus, in effect, the NMDAR channel is both a ligand-gated and voltage-gated channel at the same time. This fact is critical to the function of the NMDAR as a Hebbian coincidence detector. More strictly speaking, inward cationic current (sodium or calcium) through the open unblocked NMDAR does decrease with depolarization (because of the decreased electrochemical [...] "driving force"), but the voltage-dependent <b>unblocking</b> seems to outweigh this decrease in driving force, so the calcium influx into the spine caused by a pair of appropriately timed pre- and postsynaptic spikes significantly exceeds the sum of the influxes due to the individual spikes alone. This extra, or [...] "nonlinear", calcium entry triggers the strength change.|$|E

On 28 March 2016 Sunni Tehreek led protests of nearly 2,000 Islamic fundamentist protesters staged a three-day long sit-in at the D-Chowk in Islamabad against the execution of Mumtaz Qadri. They demanded that the Sharif government accepts their demands, which included the implementation of Shariah in the country and declaring Mumtaz Qadri a martyr. In response, Sharif addreased the nation claiming that [...] "let it be clear that those spreading outrage, fanning the fire of hatred, inciting sectarianism and creating problems for citizens will without a doubt be dealt with by means of law."On 16 March 2016, Sharif's government declared the Hindu festivals Diwali and Holi, and the Christian festival of Easter, as public holidays, Time Magazine called the step as a [...] "significant step for the country's beleaguered religious minorities."
