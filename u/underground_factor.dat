40|$|The paper aims to {{establish}} the framework for linking underground space projects and the urban microclimate, in order to construct an interdisciplinary research framework. Based on the combination of underground space, urban form and the urban microclimate, the impacts of underground space on urban microclimate factors above ground and underground are summarized and the internal mechanism is investigated. The above ground factor refers {{to the impact of}} a new urban form induced by the underground space planning on the urban microclimate. The <b>underground</b> <b>factor</b> refers to the impact of the control of the internal environment of underground space on the ground environment. This study mainly addresses two aspects. Firstly, to identify the influencing factors of urban underground space microclimate and define the research entry point and classify the indicator of the external space environment; secondly, to address the key issues of the research areas and their influence on the urban underground space project and the urban microclimate in the current phase and establish the direction of future research. The microclimate case of the Nanjing underground planning is provided to preliminarily analyze how underground space development improves the urban microclimate. By the comparative analysis of microclimate parameters, air quality parameters, and outdoor thermal environment parameters (Mean Radiant Temperature, MRT), the influences and benefits of underground space projects on the urban microclimate is quantitatively explored...|$|E

According to published reports from wear situation on the London <b>Underground,</b> the <b>factors</b> affecting the deterioration flange, the most effective agent, are moving in severe arches [27]. The severity of wear is to the extent that the flange wear is reduced 16 – 21 times only by using appropriate lubrication in arches.|$|R

Fundamental and higher-mode vibrations can be clearly seen on the spectra. The fundamental-mode frequency is about 0.15 Hz, which is the natural frequency of the skyscraper. Spectral ratios of ground accelerations at the building to those at a nearby borehole station increase from unity at the fifth floor <b>underground</b> to <b>factors</b> of 110 and 146, respectively, on the 74 th and 90 th floors above ground for the fundamental-mode vibrations. The frequency content of accelerograms, recorded {{on the fifth floor}} below ground from the great 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake, appears mainly in a frequency band of 0.015 – 0.1 Hz, leading to a fact that the ground motions did not cause high excitation in the TAIPEI 101 skyscraper.|$|R

If for reducing the gas concentrations level and the methane emissions in order to increase the safety in exploitation exist well-known solutions and methods, the oxidation or self-oxidation of the hydrocarbons from the coal bed generate a series of compounds, reaction products over maximum admitted concentrations which give birth to a toxic atmosphere and which is hazardous for workers, at the same time inducing an error in noting the occurrence of a spontaneous combustion phenomena, a major risk for the workers and for the mineral resource.

30|$|This study {{examined}} vibrations {{of the super}} tall TAIPEI 101 skyscraper located at the Hsinyi district of Taipei, Taiwan caused by the 11 March 2011, Tohoku-Oki, Japan earthquake (Mw = 9.0) from the data recorded at stations on the 74 th and 90 th floors above ground and the fifth floor underground of a newly installed seismic array inside the building and a nearby down hole station. Fundamental and higher mode vibrations, associated with local peak amplitudes, could be clearly delineated in the spectra. The fundamental-mode frequency is approximately 0.15 Hz, which is the natural frequency for the skyscraper. Spectral ratios {{on the fifth floor}} below ground to the down-hole station are smaller than 2 when f < 0.3 Hz and are up to about 10 at f = ~ 1 Hz. This could be due to amplifications of seismic waves in the soft surface layers. Ratios of spectra at the building to those at the down hole station increase from unity on the fifth floor <b>underground</b> to <b>factors</b> of 110 and 146, respectively, on the 74 th and 90 th floors above ground for the fundamental mode.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: It is {{necessary}} to study the mechanic behavior of underground pipelines during the excavation of the foundation pit, because the excavation will inevitably endanger the nearby <b>underground</b> pipelines. Three <b>factors</b> include the depth of underground pipelines, {{the distance from the}} pipeline to the foundation pit and ground load are considered to conform comparative analysis, in order to study the variaty on the stress and deformation of the underground pipelines. The foundation surporting type and the soil layer distribution are also considered during the numerical simulation. The results show that the distance between pipeline and foundation has more influence on the underground pipelines than other two factors, the damage most likely occurred in the bottom right in the pipeline near the foundation pit...|$|R

It is therefore important in fire safety design to give adequate consideration to all aspects related to evacuation. The main {{purpose of this paper}} is to provide guidance to engineers involved in the design of underground transportation systems, and to create a basis for future research in the area. A review of previously reported fire accidents and of empirical research is performed. The review of accidents is based on a theoretical framework, namely four accepted human behaviour theories, which can be used in the fire safety design of <b>underground</b> transportation systems. <b>Factors</b> important for fire evacuation in these types of facilities are also presented, and data related to these factors are summarised. The review reveals many potential solutions to commonly observed evacuation problems, but it also shows that there is room for further future research in the area...|$|R

40|$|Continuous airflow {{monitoring}} {{can improve}} {{the safety of the}} underground work force by ensuring the uninterrupted and controlled distribution of mine ventilation to all working areas. Air velocity measurements vary significantly and can change rapidly depending on the exact measurement location and, in particular, due to the presence of obstructions in the air stream. Air velocity must be measured at locations away from obstructions to avoid the vortices and eddies that can produce inaccurate readings. Further, an uninterrupted measurement path cannot always be guaranteed when using continuous airflow monitors due to the presence of nearby equipment, personnel, roof falls and rib rolls. Effective use of these devices requires selection of a minimum distance from an obstacle, such that an air velocity measurement can be made but not affected by the presence of that obstacle. This paper investigates the impacts of an obstruction on the behavior of downstream airflow using a numerical CFD model calibrated with experimental test results from <b>underground</b> testing. <b>Factors</b> including entry size, obstruction size and the inlet or incident velocity are examined for their effects on the distributions of airflow around an obstruction. A relationship is developed between the minimum measurement distance and the hydraulic diameters of the entry and the obstruction. A final analysis considers the impacts of continuous monitor location on the accuracy of velocity measurements and on the application of minimum measurement distance guidelines.

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{developing}} trend of long, large and deep construction characteristics for underground engineering in the world, China {{has the largest}} number of karst tunnels with the wide scales and great difficulties. As the hydrogeological conditions are becoming unprecedentedly complex, water inrush disaster becomes the bottleneck problem for the further development of traffic tunnels. Based on the statistical analysis {{of a large number of}} cases of water inrush in karst tunnels, influence factors of water inrush have been put forward from the view of karst hydrogeological factors and engineering disturbance of human factors. Karst hydrogeological factors include geological defect, strata dip, formation lithology, landform and <b>underground</b> level. Human <b>factors</b> of engineering disturbance include excavation and reinforcement geological prediction, monitoring and measurement of surrounding rock.

40|$|Both {{social economy}} and {{informal}} economy define complex economic phenomena, multifaceted, which generated multiple platform debate and analysis among economists, sociologists and lawyers. Perspectives on these concepts {{are the most}} diverse and present work attempts to link these views to find common denominators, but also the elements that differentiate them. Official social economy interacts with the informal economy through the initial use of capital and generating links between different forms of capital. Underground economy is based more on use of illicit and immoral capital, while {{the development of a}} formal social require networks of trust, reciprocal links with other groups and institutions, social and economic relations that are based on values and norms recognized by society. The interplay of social economy - informal economy is manifested either through a transition from the sphere of the informal (unofficial) to formal (official) or by maintaining and emphasizing underground activities as a result of using illegal or informal social networks and social capital already existing. From the perspective of this study, social economy-binomial informal economy should be seen as: a) mediating factor between the official and unofficial; b) factor of influence to ensure a legal and institutional framework apt to limit and discourage <b>underground</b> activities; c) <b>factor</b> of transition from the informal economy to the social economy. </p...|$|R
40|$|Differential SAR {{interferometry}} {{allows for}} the detection and mapping of ground subsidences, usually attributable to human activities, associated with the extraction of fluids beneath the surface, or <b>underground</b> mining… Limiting <b>factors</b> for monitoring slow subsidences are mainly temporal coherence loss and varying atmospheric conditions between the acquisitions of images. Such variations induce a path difference generating InSAR artifacts that cannot be corrected if only one interferogram is available. On urban areas, the coherence remains often high over long time scales. The main problem then {{appears to be the}} atmospheric heterogeneities. This kind of artifacts can be easily detected on the different interferograms we generated on the city of Paris. Significant phase variations are clearly visible, and can not be associated with topographic fringes, nor with displacements. Several techniques exist in order to eliminate or reduce the effect of atmospheric artifacts: a solution consists in summing and averaging interferograms, but requires several interferograms over the same site. The advantages of a novel approach based on complex correlation of interferograms are presented here, in particular robustness when only a few interferograms are available (two interferograms are enough, under given hypotheses). These algorithms were tested in the context of automatic detection of atmospheric artifacts by means of correlation of interferometric triplets. On the city of Paris, this method reveals 2 subsiding zones. One zone has the same location as an important underground working site, which took place from 1995 to 1997. The existence of subsidences in the area was known already from ground truth data. Their spatial extent can now be mapped by interferometry, and the temporal evolution of the subsidences is also examined here...|$|R
40|$|The Marsala area, at {{the western}} end of Sicily, has been {{historically}} interested by quarry activities, both at surface and underground. The carved rocks are Lower Pleistocene calcarenites, defined as “Calcarenite di Marsala” and referred to the Marsala syntheme. The subterranean quarries, now abandoned, show increasing instability signs becoming in time a risk factor for several causes, among which: a) breakdowns due to poor (weak) strength of rock and to large size of voids; b) progressive weathering of rock; c) effects of the discontinuities in the rock mass with the pillars and/or walls of the <b>underground</b> quarries. These <b>factors</b> contributed to enlargement of the subterranean voids and to their upward propagation, thus triggering several sinkholes. The fast urbanization of the city masked many subterranean quarries causing the loss of memory of their location.

40|$|Marsala area, in {{the western}} end of Sicily, has been {{historically}} interested by quarry activities, both at surface and underground. The carved rocks are Lower Pleistocene calcarenites, defined as “Calcarenite di Marsala” and referred to the Marsala syntheme. These calcarenites are composed of three main lithofacies with vertical and lateral passages: a) coarse to fine yellow bio- and lithoclastic calcarenites, rich in macrofossils; b) sands; and c) gray sandy clays. According to previous authors, the calcarenitic lithofacies can be divided into three lithotypes: i) coarse calcarenites and calcirudites strata, from 10 to 100 cm thick; ii) fine to coarse calcarenites with thickened grains; iii) medium to coarse calcarenites in irregular strata with intercalations of thin silt beds. The subterranean quarries, now abandoned, show increasing instability signs becoming in time a risk factor for several causes, among which: a) breakdowns due to poor (weak) strength of rock and to large size of voids; b) progressive weathering of rock; c) relationship between the horst rock discontinuities and pillars and/or walls of the <b>underground</b> quarries. These <b>factors</b> contributed to enlargement of the subterranean voids and to their upward propagation, thus triggering several sinkholes. The fast urbanization of the city masked many subterranean quarries causing the loss of memory of their location. In the last decades, numerous sinkholes occurred both in urban areas and in areas designated for agricultural use, creating extensive damage to buildings and infrastructures. The latest sinkhole episode occurred in the Amabilina area, at the eastern suburbs of Marsala. Here, in the late afternoon of November 21 st, 2013 a sinkhole of impressive dimensions formed affecting an agricultural area, where until a few minutes before the owner was working. The area is located in the neighborhood of small rural buildings, housing and factories. The depression shows an elliptical perimeter (100 × 70 m) and a depth of at least 15 m. At the bottom, some rooms up to 5 m high of an underground quarry, are visible. Since the first investigation, {{it was clear that the}} sinkhole was caused by pillars failure and the upward propagation of the voids. This last factor increased as soon as the void reached the portion of the calcarenitic lithofacies rich in fossils.

40|$|Current {{techniques}} {{available for}} GRP tank design are time consuming and use either highly analytical formulations {{that are based}} on assumptions, or rely on expensive destructive experimental tests. Because of the variety of loading conditions that these tanks are subjected to when <b>underground,</b> a high <b>factor</b> of safety is usually appied to compensate for discrepancy between theory and practice. This results in sometimes unnecessarily increasing the material cost, wright and manufacturing time. The objective of this work is to find a more deterministic design approach based on experimental and analytical methods in order to predict the properties, integrity and performance of underground GRP tanks. The design methodology is the result of correlation between computational (linear and non-linear FE analysis), analytical and experimental procedures. The methodology should lead to an empirical description for mechanical characteristics of GRP tanks. Once tested it can be proposed as a standard method that can lead to a complete solution for GRP tank design, applied {{to a wide range of}} tank sizes and laminate lay-ups and properties. This replaces the needs for the expensive field tests that are specified in the current standards. It is also expected to prevent the excessive usage of composite material (due to applying high safety factors), and at the same time, prevents the underestimation of the effect of severe loading conditions. In this research GRP material properties used for underground tanks were estimated by using experimental (ie mechanical testing of samples ytaken from GRP tanks), analytical and numerical methods. An empirical description for the determination of elastic properties of GRP material is proposed using FEA method. A series of experiments on full size tanks were designed and tested to generate repeatable data to be used for correlation with simple linear elastic analysis using FEA to establish the validity of FEA as an alternative tool. Correlation between the two types of data showed the correct modelling technique and its limitations. This investigation helped to establish the confidence level required when using a FEA method. Buckling analysis of GRP tanks both experimentally (by vacuum testing of tanks to destruction) and numerically (using geometrically non-linear FEA) was concluded and failure loads and failure modes were compared for all tests with experimental results, British (BS 4995) and European (CEN) standards. Comparison has shown a good agreement with the numerical method, however, both standards results have been shown to be unreliable when used with anisotropic material. An individual investigation of the parameters that contribute to buckling failure has led to the development of an empirical design description for predicting buckling failure of GRP vesels based on a novel and numerical analysis. Finally based on the above work, a complete design methodology is proposed for the design of underground GRP tanks, and a computer program was developed to help the manufacturer to design an optimum vessel for the required application...|$|R
