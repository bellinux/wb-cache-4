5|$|The {{load factor}} (or {{capacity}} factor) for South Australian wind farms is <b>usually</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> range 32-38%. This {{means that a}} wind farm could typically produce between 32 and 38% of its nameplate capacity averaged over a year.|$|E
5|$|Until the 1960s, a badge {{was worn}} {{on the playing}} shirt only for {{high-profile}} matches such as FA Cup finals, <b>usually</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of a monogram of the club's initials in red on a white background.|$|E

5|$|Air {{rises and}} rotates around a {{vertical}} axis, <b>usually</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{same direction as}} low-pressure systems in both northern and southern hemisphere. They are most often cyclonic, that is, associated with a localized low-pressure region within a supercell. Such storms can feature strong surface winds and severe hail. Mesocyclones often occur together with updrafts in supercells, where tornadoes may form. About 1700 mesocyclones form annually across the United States, but only half produce tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|An Atlantic {{hurricane}} or {{tropical storm}} is a tropical cyclone that {{forms in the}} Atlantic Ocean, <b>usually</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer or fall. A hurricane differs from a cyclone or typhoon only {{on the basis of}} location. A hurricane is a storm that occurs in the Atlantic Ocean and northeastern Pacific Ocean, a typhoon occurs in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, and a cyclone occurs in the south Pacific or Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of the House Appropriations Committee, Moran worked to {{allocate}} federal funding to projects in Northern Virginia, <b>usually</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> technology and defense industries.

5|$|Aware of the {{importance}} of causal structure, Roger Penrose and others developed what is known as global geometry. In global geometry, the object of study is not one particular solution (or family of solutions) to Einstein's equations. Rather, relations that hold true for all geodesics, such as the Raychaudhuri equation, and additional non-specific assumptions about the nature of matter (<b>usually</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of energy conditions) are used to derive general results.|$|E
5|$|Beaches {{were blocked}} with {{entanglements}} of barbed wire, <b>usually</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of three coils of concertina wire fixed by metal posts, or a simple fence of straight wires supported on waist-high posts. The wire would also demarcate extensive minefields, with both anti-tank and anti-personnel mines on {{and behind the}} beaches. On {{many of the more}} remote beaches this combination of wire and mines represented {{the full extent of the}} passive defences.|$|E
5|$|Both the East Riding and Hull {{are still}} {{covered by the}} Humberside Police area and the Humberside Fire and Rescue Service.

5|$|Catholic worship was {{deliberately}} low key, <b>usually</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> private houses of recusant landholders or in domestic buildings adapted for services. Surviving chapels {{from this period}} are generally austere and simply furnished. Typical worship consisted of a sermon, long vernacular prayers and an unsung Low Mass in Latin. Musical accompaniment was prohibited until the nineteenth century, when organs began to be introduced into chapels.|$|E
5|$|Cholangitis can be life-threatening, and is {{regarded}} as a medical emergency. Characteristic symptoms include yellow discoloration of the skin or whites of the eyes, fever, abdominal pain, and in severe cases, low blood pressure and confusion. Initial treatment is with intravenous fluids and antibiotics, but there is often an underlying problem (such as gallstones or narrowing in the bile duct) for which further tests and treatments may be necessary, <b>usually</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of endoscopy to relieve obstruction of the bile duct. The word is from Greek chol-, bile + ang-, vessel + -itis, inflammation.|$|E
5|$|Cultivation {{requirements}} {{vary greatly}} by species. In general, though, sundews require high environmental moisture content, <b>usually</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{form of a}} constantly moist or wet soil substrate. Most species also require this water to be pure, as nutrients, salts, or minerals in their soil can stunt their growth or even kill them. Commonly, plants are grown in a soil substrate containing some combination of dead or live sphagnum moss, sphagnum peat moss, sand, and/or perlite, and are watered with distilled, reverse osmosis, or rain water.|$|E

5|$|Estimates for {{the cavalry}} are <b>usually</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1,000–3,000 range. The Persian cavalry was usually {{provided}} by the ethnic Persians, Bactrians, Medes, Cissians, and Saka; most of these probably fought as lightly armed missile cavalry. The fleet must {{have had at least}} some proportion of transport ships, since the cavalry was carried by ship; whilst Herodotus claims the cavalry was carried in the triremes, this is improbable. Lazenby estimates 30–40 transport ships would be required to carry 1,000 cavalry.|$|E
5|$|For {{personal}} protection, most Roman troops wore metal {{body armour}} (<b>usually</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form a chain mail cuirass) and helmets, {{in addition to}} shields. In contrast, among the Alamanni, metal armour and helmets were probably owned {{by members of the}} social elite only. Most Alamanni foot soldiers had only shields and no metal armour or helmets.|$|E
5|$|Helicobacter pylori, {{previously}} Campylobacter pylori, is a gram-negative, microaerophilic bacterium found <b>usually</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stomach. It {{was identified}} in 1982 by Australian scientists Barry Marshall and Robin Warren, {{who found that}} it was present in a person with chronic gastritis and gastric ulcers, conditions not previously believed to have a microbial cause. It is also linked to the development of duodenal ulcers and stomach cancer. However, over 80% of individuals infected with the bacterium are asymptomatic, and it may {{play an important role in}} the natural stomach ecology.|$|E

5|$|In coal seams, coal {{balls are}} {{completely}} surrounded by coal. They are often found randomly {{scattered throughout the}} seam in isolated groups, <b>usually</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper half of the seam. Their occurrence in coal seams can be either extremely sporadic or regular; many coal seams {{have been found to}} contain no coal balls, while others have been found to contain so many coal balls that miners avoid the area entirely.|$|E
5|$|In the tropics, many {{amphibians}} breed continuously or at {{any time}} of year. In temperate regions, breeding is mostly seasonal, <b>usually</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spring, and is triggered by increasing day length, rising temperatures or rainfall. Experiments have shown the importance of temperature, but the trigger event, especially in arid regions, is often a storm. In anurans, males usually arrive at the breeding sites before females and the vocal chorus they produce may stimulate ovulation in females and the endocrine activity of males that are not yet reproductively active.|$|E
5|$|Juveniles {{begin to}} court {{at a very}} early age, but may not bond for another two or three years. Aerial acrobatics, demonstrations of intelligence, and ability to provide food are key {{behaviors}} of courting. Once paired, they tend to nest together for life, <b>usually</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same location. Instances of non-monogamy have been observed in common ravens, by males visiting a female's nest when her mate is away.|$|E
