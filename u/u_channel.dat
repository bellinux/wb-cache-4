The water in the toilet bowl is connected to a hollow drain pipe shaped like an upside-down U connecting the drain. One side of the <b>U</b> <b>channel</b> is arranged as a hollow siphon tube longer than {{the water in the}} bowl is high. The siphon tube connects to the drain. The top of the upside-down U-shaped drain pipe limits the height of the water in the bowl before it flows down the drain. If water is poured slowly into the bowl it simply flows over the rim of the upside-down U and pours slowly down the drain—thus the toilet does not flush. The standing water in the bowl acts as a barrier to sewer gas coming out of the sewer through the drain, and also as a receptacle for waste. Sewer gas is vented through a separate vent pipe attached to the sewer line.|$|E

30|$|A novel {{high-performance}} rectangular gate <b>U</b> <b>channel</b> FET (RGUC FET) for extreme integrated {{distance between}} source and drain contacts is proposed in this paper. The RGUC FET represents nearly ideal subthreshold characteristics till {{the distance between}} source/drain (S/D) contacts reduced to 2 [*]nm. Different from the other recessed or U-shaped channel-based FETs, the gate contacts {{do not need to}} be formed in the recessed region but only in a layer of spacer for the insulation between the two vertical parts on both sides of the <b>U</b> <b>channel.</b> Its structural advantages make it possible to be applied to manufacture integrated circuits with higher integration for extreme integrated distance between source and drain contacts. The electrical properties of the RGUC FET were scrupulously investigated by studying the influence of design parameters including the horizontal distance between S/D contacts, the extension height of S/D region, and the thickness and material of the gate oxide layer. The electrical properties of the RGUC FET are verified by quantum simulation. Compared to the other non-planner channel multi-gate FETs, the novel RGUC FET is suitable for higher integration.|$|E
40|$|With the {{development}} of pass-through cryogenic magnetometers and the <b>u</b> <b>channel</b> sampling method, large volumes of paleomagnetic data can be accumulated {{within a short time}} period. It is often critical to visualize and process these data in “real time” as measurements proceed, so that the measurement plan can be dictated accordingly. We introduce new MATLAB™ software (UPmag) that is designed for easy and rapid analysis of natural remanent magnetization (NRM) and laboratory-induced remanent magnetization data for <b>u</b> <b>channel</b> samples or core sections. UPmag comprises three MATLAB™ graphic user interfaces: UVIEW, UDIR, and UINT. UVIEW allows users to open and check through measurement data from the magnetometer as well as to correct detected flux jumps in the data, and to export files for further treatment. UDIR reads the *. dir file generated by UVIEW, automatically calculates component directions using selectable demagnetization range(s) with anchored or free origin, and displays vector component plots and stepwise intensity plots for any position along the <b>u</b> <b>channel</b> sample. UDIR can also display data on equal area stereographic projections and draw virtual geomagnetic poles on various map projections. UINT provides a convenient platform to evaluate relative paleointensity (RPI) estimates using the *. int files that can be exported from UVIEW. Two methods are used for RPI estimation: the calculated slopes of the best fit line between the NRM and the respective normalizer (using paired demagnetization data for both parameters) and the averages of the NRM/normalizer ratios. Linear correlation coefficients (of slopes) and standard deviations (of ratios) can be calculated simultaneously to monitor the quality of the RPI estimates. All resulting data and plots from UPmag can be exported into various file formats. UPmag software, data format files, and test data can be downloaded from [URL]...|$|E

40|$|Lattice QCD {{calculations}} of energies in bosonic channels have mostly been restrictedto {{the use of}} quark-antiquark meson operators due to the computationalchallenges associated with evaluating correlation functions of multi-meson operators. The stochastic LapH method has provided {{an efficient way to}} compute correlationfunctions involving multi-hadron operators. This method is applied to construct a 58 x 58 correlation matrix using 9 single-meson operators and 49 two-meson operatorsin the isodoublet strangeness S = 1 T 1 <b>u</b> <b>channel,</b> which contains the spin- 1 and spin- 3 kaon states. The matrix of temporal correlations is evaluated using a Monte Carloensemble of 551 configurations on an anisotropic 243 x 128 lattice. Due to computationallimitations, light quark masses are used that produce an unphysically heavypion having a mass around 390 MeV, but the strange quark mass is tuned to its physicalvalue. A clover-improved Wilson fermion action is used in generating the MonteCarlo ensemble, and the correlators are formed using source and sink operators constructedout of Laplacian Heaviside smeared quark fields displaced with stout-smearedgauge links. Overlap factors are used to identify the finite-volume eigenstates thatshould evolve into the kaon resonances in infinite volume.

40|$|We {{report on}} new {{developments}} in the long-core measurement techniques using <b>u</b> <b>channels</b> in connection with new small-access cryogenic magnetometers. With these new instruments, u-channel samples allow us to measure a wide range of magnetic parameters along entire-core length with a spatial resolution and accuracy virtually equivalent to that obtained using discrete cubic samples. An additional advantage is that the sediment disturbance when sampling is significantly less when using <b>u</b> <b>channels.</b> We present comparisons of results from both continuous and discrete measurements and examine the effectiveness of minimal deconvolution using various techniques. Examples of continuous measurements of low-field susceptibility, NRM, ARM, IRM, Hrc from North Atlantic deep-sea cores show {{that it is possible to}} generate logs of combination of parameters related to rock-magnetic characteristics of the sediments useful in palaeoceanography. In particular, the continuous method allows us to rapidly detect core regions with fast changing magnetic parameters useful for correlation between cores and also for understanding changes in palaeo-environmental conditions. The fast scan also allows us to detect regions of the core where the rock magnetic parameters are suitable (or not suitable) for palaeomagnetic studies related to changes in the geomagnetic field such as the relative changes in palaeointensity. <br/...|$|R
