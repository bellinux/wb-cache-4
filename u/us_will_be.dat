Before the dancing, our {{problems}} were really heavy to bear. Dancing takes our minds away from our problems. Our bodies became more healthy. As for the judges, they may be impressed with us, seeing that we are being rehabilitated and this could help our case. We are being rehabilitated in a good way.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Rico pins Panay to {{the exposed}} {{core of the}} U.S.-bound missile, and reprograms the {{targeting}} computer before jumping to safety. The missile changes course and explodes over Panau's oilfields, killing Panay and destroying the island's oil reserves. Rico rejoins Sheldon, Kane and Jade, who are dismayed {{at the loss of}} billions of dollars' worth of oil. Rico explains that oil is not worth dying for; with its oil gone, interest in Panau will be lost, the superpowers will not war and the island's residents will be spared. Sheldon agrees, assuring Rico that a president friendly to the <b>U.S.</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> installed on Panau and the island will be closely monitored; the group raise their glasses, toasting friendship and a job well done.|$|E

500|$|In 2015, {{following}} British {{prime minister}} David Cameron's decision to give Members of Parliament a free vote on amending the law against fox hunting, McCartney was quoted: [...] "The people of Britain are behind this Tory government on many things {{but the vast}} majority of <b>us</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> against them if hunting is reintroduced. It is cruel and unnecessary and will lose them support from ordinary people and animal lovers like myself." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1972 Larkin {{wrote the}} oft-quoted [...] "Going, Going", a poem which expresses a romantic fatalism in {{its view of}} England that was typical of his later years. In it he prophesies a {{complete}} destruction of the countryside, and expresses an idealised sense of national togetherness and identity: [...] "And that will be England gone... it will linger on in galleries; but all that remains for <b>us</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> concrete and tyres". The poem ends with the blunt statement, [...] "I just think it will happen, soon." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 2008, Hydro-Québec, {{along with}} American {{utilities}} Northeast Utilities and NSTAR, created {{a joint venture}} {{to build a new}} HVDC line from Windsor, Quebec to Deerfield, New Hampshire. Hydro-Québec will own the segment within Quebec, while the segment within the <b>US</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> owned by Northern Pass Transmission LLC, a partnership between Northeast Utilities (75%) and NSTAR (25%). Estimated to cost US$1.1 billion to build, it is projected that the line will either run in existing right-of-way adjacent to the HVDC line that runs through New Hampshire, or it will connect to a right-of-way in northern New Hampshire that will run through the White Mountains. This [...] line, projected to carry 1,200 megawatts, will bring electricity to approximately one million homes.|$|E

500|$|The first {{official}} trailer for X-Men: Days of Future Past {{was released in}} October 2013. Jason Callina of Herald News gave the trailer a positive response, saying, [...] "it is fantastic to see characters that I grew up with in the flesh...we still {{have to wait till}} the end of May to see if Fox succeeded, but for now they have my interest". Ben Child of The Guardian criticized the trailer for the amount of characters that will appear in the film. Child wrote, [...] "overloading the movie with superheroes might please fans of the comic books, but the rest of <b>us</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> chewing on our own spleens when the umpteenth brightly coloured dude turns up to spout one line of dialogue, then drop off the map".|$|E
500|$|On {{how much}} more [...] "mature" [...] the episode is from {{previous}} episodes given the later air time, Whedon explained that ABC [...] "haven't really ever given us a note on violence. We've cut people into pieces and hacked them up and shot people point blank in the head. Never got any notes on that. So pushing the envelope for <b>us</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> in the sexual nature". This {{is evidenced by the}} episode's opening, a [...] "sexy" [...] look at the character Quake getting dressed. Executive producer Jeph Loeb added, [...] "what it does is give us the chance to tell different stories. The idea is some of the material might be more mature, there may be more grit, what we're doing might be darker. It certainly made a lot more sense when we wanted to introduce a character like Ghost Rider into this world." ...|$|E
500|$|Eight months later, the {{government}} {{took a different}} approach to solve its problem with Rainbow, {{in the form of the}} 1986 Treaty Between the United States of America and the Republic of Iceland to Facilitate Their Defense Relationship. [...] This treaty, negotiated by future Secretary of Veteran Affairs Ed Derwinski, updated the 1951 U.S.Iceland treaty, adding an explicit exemption of the Cargo Preference Act, guaranteeing 35% of the contract would go to Icelandic companies, and giving Icelandic companies an opportunity to compete for up to 65% of the contract." [...] At the time, Derwinski said, [...] "If we don't solve this problem, then the <b>U.S.</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> in a cod war". [...] The United States Senate ratified the treaty one day before Reagan left for Reykjavik to attend a summit meeting with Mikhail Gorbachev. Reagan met with the President of Iceland, Vigdís Finnbogadóttir, before seeing Gorbachev, giving his guarantee that the majority of the contract would be returned to Icelandic shipping companies.|$|E

500|$|His on-air {{commentary}} {{has caused}} controversy. As a commentator, Boycott has renewed his 'pull-no-punches' style {{in contrast to}} most of his fellow commentators. In particular he is known for criticising players, often in a caustic and strident style. In 2005 he mocked the Australian captain Ricky Ponting for electing to bowl first on a batsman-friendly pitch, saying he was a [...] "nice man" [...] for being so generous to the England team. In 2006, he was initially receptive to the difficulties endured by Marcus Trescothick during his periods of stress-related illness; however, he was not always as amiable. In March 2008, recently dropped Steve Harmison attacked Boycott {{in an article in}} The Mail on Sunday where he referred to Boycott as a [...] "waste of space." [...] This was in response to Boycott's statement a few days previously on 19 March 2008 that if Harmison [...] "gets a central contract this summer then a lot of <b>us</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> screaming favouritism and a total waste of money. England should forget him".|$|E
500|$|In general, Sullivan {{preferred}} {{to write in}} major keys. In the Savoy operas, there are only eleven substantial numbers wholly in a minor key (less than 5% of the musical numbers), and even in his serious works the major prevails. Examples of Sullivan's rare excursions into minor keys include the long E minor melody in the first movement of the Irish Symphony, [...] "Go away, madam" [...] in the Act I finale of Iolanthe (echoing Verdi and Beethoven) and the funeral march in the Act I finale of The Yeomen of the Guard. Sullivan was happy on occasion to use chords traditionally considered technically incorrect. When reproached for using consecutive fifths in Cox and Box, he replied [...] "if 5ths turn up it doesn't matter, {{so long as there}} is no offence to the ear." [...] Hughes comments that harmonic contrast in the Savoy works is enhanced by Sullivan's characteristic modulation between keys, as in [...] "Expressive glances" [...] (Princess Ida), where he smoothly negotiates E major, C sharp minor and C major, or [...] "Then one of <b>us</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a queen" [...] (The Gondoliers), where he writes in F major, D flat major and D minor.|$|E
500|$|The {{financial}} problems within the Beatles' Apple business empire became another divisive issue at this time. From summer 1968 until {{the appointment of}} Allen Klein as business manager in March 1969, McCartney was a regular presence at Apple's central London headquarters, calling staff meetings and urging financial restraint. While noting that all the individual Beatles were demanding employers, Apple press officer Derek Taylor later described McCartney as [...] "the bossiest of the bossy"; according to Tony Bramwell, Apple Records' head of promotions, Lennon and partner Yoko Ono inflicted [...] "their own reign of terror". On 18 January, Disc magazine published what author Peter Doggett describes as [...] "a heroin-fuelled monologue" [...] by Lennon {{in which he said}} of Apple's finances: [...] "If it carries on like this, all of <b>us</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> broke in the next few months." [...] While McCartney sought to appoint his in-laws, New York lawyers Lee and John Eastman, as the band's business advisors, Lennon's outburst attracted the attention of the less conservative Klein. The latter effectively became the Beatles' manager when Harrison and Ringo Starr also chose to put their faith in his tough approach to business. Refusing to acknowledge Klein as his representative, McCartney later cited this division as the first [...] "irreconcilable difference" [...] among the four Beatles, leading to the band's break-up in April 1970.|$|E

2500|$|Leading the {{decimated}} brigade during Pickett's Charge, Marshall's men {{crossed the}} field around the Bliss Farm and Stevens' Run and then crossed the Emmitsburg Rd, coming under withering {{fire at the}} fence line. While crossing the Emmitsburg Road, Marshall turned to Capt. Stockton Heth (son of Maj. Gen. Henry Heth) and said [...] "We do not know which of <b>us</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> next to fall." [...] Just minutes later, as Marshall neared the stonewall on Cemetery Ridge he was struck in the forehead and killed instantly by two bullets while cheering his men on.|$|E
2500|$|In the Middle Ages {{the birth}} of Jesus as the second Adam {{came to be seen}} in the context of Saint Augustine's Felix culpa (i.e. happy fall) and was {{intertwined}} with the popular teachings on the fall from grace of Adam and Eve. Augustine was fond of a statement on Nativity by Saint Gregory of Nyssa and he quoted in five times: [...] "Venerate the Nativity, through which you are freed from the bonds of an earthly nativity". And he liked to quote: [...] "Just as in Adam all of us died, so too in Christ all of <b>us</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> brought to life".|$|E
