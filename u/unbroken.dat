5|$|As the Japanese regrouped, the U.S. forces {{concentrated}} on shoring up and strengthening their Lunga defenses. On 18 September, an Allied naval convoy delivered 4,157 {{men from the}} U.S. 7th Marine Regiment to Guadalcanal. These reinforcements allowed Vandegrift—beginning on 19 September—to establish an <b>unbroken</b> line of defense completely around the Lunga perimeter.|$|E
5|$|In total, {{during his}} college career Tittle set school passing records with 162 {{completions}} out of 330 attempts for 2,525 yards and 23 touchdowns. He scored seven touchdowns {{himself as a}} runner. His passing totals remained <b>unbroken</b> until Bert Jones surpassed them in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|It was Dufourny's {{great friend}} and fellow {{architect}} Giuseppe Marvuglia who was to preside over the gradual decline of Sicilian Baroque. In 1784 he designed the Palazzo Riso-Belmonte, the finest example of this period of architectural transition, combining both Baroque and Palladian motifs, built around an arcaded courtyard providing Baroque masses of light and shade, or chiaroscuro. The main façade, punctuated by giant pilasters, also had Baroque features, but the skyline was <b>unbroken.</b> The pilasters were undecorated, simple, and Ionic, and supported an undecorated entablature. Above the windows were classical <b>unbroken</b> pediments. Sicilian Baroque was waning.|$|E
5|$|The Manor is now {{within the}} civil parish of Chippenham Without; <b>unbroken</b> {{occupation}} since 1282 makes Sheldon Manor Wiltshire's longest continuously inhabited manor house. It was granted Grade I listed building status by the Historic Building and Monuments Commission for England in 1960.|$|E
5|$|The band have {{released}} five critically acclaimed albums; 2007's In Love with Detail, 2009's You Can Make Sound, 2012's Little Sparks, 2014's acoustic album, <b>Unbroken,</b> Untied, and 2014's Night Becomes Light.|$|E
5|$|The band's early {{sound was}} rooted in post-punk and pop but {{eventually}} grew to incorporate influences from many genres of popular music. In 2010, they began experimenting with acoustic music, (obvious in 2014 release <b>Unbroken,</b> Untied) a theme that would expand and develop their sound and audience.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} East Anglian kings were pagans. They {{belonged to}} the Wuffingas dynasty, named after Wuffa, whose ancestors originated from northern Europe and whose descendants ruled the East Angles in an almost <b>unbroken</b> line until after the reign of Ælfwald {{in the middle of}} the 8th century.|$|E
5|$|The typical {{arrangement}} for an English Gothic east end is square, {{and may be}} an <b>unbroken</b> cliff-like design as at York, Lincoln, Ripon, Ely and Carlisle or may have a projecting Lady Chapel of {{which there is a}} great diversity as at Salisbury, Lichfield, Hereford, Exeter and Chichester.|$|E
5|$|After Hardorff's death, {{the main}} proponent of Classicism was Christian Frederik Hansen who {{developed}} a more severe style with clean, simple forms and large, <b>unbroken</b> surfaces. From 1800, {{he was in}} charge of all major building projects in Copenhagen where he designed the Copenhagen City Hall & Courthouse (1805–15) on Nytorv. He was also responsible for rebuilding Church of Our Lady (Vor Frue Kirke) and designing the surrounding square (1811–29).|$|E
5|$|After {{elections}} in 1884, a Catholic government under Jules Malou passed a new Education Law providing {{public financial support}} for religious schools. Religious education became compulsory in all schools in 1895. The Catholic Party's triumph in the issue was another blow to the already-weakened Liberal Party, and ushered {{in a period of}} almost <b>unbroken</b> Catholic government until World War II.|$|E
5|$|An era in {{the history}} of California closed yesterday. The Del Valles of Camulos bade {{farewell}} to the homestead where they have lived in successive generations since Antonio del Valle. It was the passing of the old regime. They are said to be the last of the old Spanish families who held in <b>unbroken</b> succession to the ancestral acres.|$|E

5|$|Billy, a Kashmir goat, is {{descended from}} the same royal {{bloodline}} as the original herd, but was not selected from the wild population; {{he was born in}} Whipsnade Zoo. He was presented to the regiment by Queen Elizabeth II in 2001. The tradition is not new: since 1844, the British monarchy has presented an <b>unbroken</b> series of Kashmir goats to the Royal Welch Fusiliers from the Crown's own royal herd.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} nine seasons, Malmö FF {{finished}} in the top three in the league. The club won the Swedish Championship in 1949, 1950, 1951 and 1953, and were runners-up in 1946, 1948 and 1952. The club also won Svenska Cupen in 1944, 1946, 1947, 1951 and 1953, and finished as runners-up in 1945. Between 6 May 1949 and 1 June 1951, the team were unbeaten in 49 matches, of which 23 were an <b>unbroken</b> streak of victories.|$|E
5|$|His {{subjects}} resented {{paying taxes}} that were spent on his mistresses and their children, {{many of whom}} received dukedoms or earldoms. The present Dukes of Buccleuch, Richmond, Grafton and St Albans descend from Charles in <b>unbroken</b> male line. Diana, Princess of Wales, was descended from two of Charles's illegitimate sons: the Dukes of Grafton and Richmond. Diana's son, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, second in line to the British throne, {{is likely to be}} the first British monarch descended from Charles II.|$|E
5|$|Ireland {{continued}} as {{a patchwork of}} rival kingdoms but, beginning in the 7th century, a concept of national kingship gradually became articulated through {{the concept of a}} High King of Ireland. Medieval Irish literature portrays an almost <b>unbroken</b> sequence of High Kings stretching back thousands of years but modern historians believe the scheme was constructed in the 8th century to justify the status of powerful political groupings by projecting the origins of their rule into the remote past.|$|E
5|$|On April 19, 2014 Delorentos {{released}} <b>Unbroken,</b> Untied a self-recorded {{and produced}} Acoustic album. A collection of 13 acoustic tracks, nine {{of which were}} completely reworked versions of previous releases while four were unreleased tracks (three of which later appeared on subsequent album Night Becomes Light). The physical release was contained in a handmade individually stamped boxes, limited to 147 copies. These sold out in hours on Record Store Day, 2014.|$|E
5|$|Predominantly insectivorous, the {{black-throated blue warbler}} {{supplements}} its {{diet with}} berries and seeds in winter. It builds its nests in thick shrubs and the closeness of its nesting sites to the ground make it a favored species {{for the study of}} warbler behavior in the wild. The black-throated blue warbler defends its territory against other birds of the same species for both nesting and winter habitats. As the black-throated blue warbler requires large, <b>unbroken</b> forest areas for nesting, its numbers are declining.|$|E
5|$|Saville was a {{technical}} and scientific-minded leader who helped pioneer advanced mathematics for operations research, and computer systems for centralized coordination of air defense. He advocated {{the expansion of}} radar installations to create an <b>unbroken</b> air defense network. He explored {{the concept of a}} military aircraft designed around an integrated electronics fire-control system built by various subcontractors. After retiring from the military, Saville worked in the defense industry.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{severe weather}} was ongoing {{at the start}} of April 27 and {{continued}} for the entire day virtually <b>unbroken.</b> For the second day in a row, the SPC issued a high risk of severe weather for the Southern United States, and late that morning the SPC increased the probability for tornadoes to 45 percent along a corridor from Meridian, Mississippi, to Huntsville, Alabama, an extremely rare issuance exceeding the high risk standards. Conditions for tornadoes became increasingly favorable for an extreme tornado outbreak.|$|E
5|$|The Boys Light Up reached No. 4 on the Australian album {{charts and}} {{remained}} in the charts for an <b>unbroken</b> 101 weeks. It sold five times platinum: over 280,000 copies, {{and became one of}} the biggest Australian albums of the 1980s. Singer/guitarist/songwriter Guy McDonough (ex-The Flatheads and Bill's younger brother) joined the group in October 1980.|$|E
5|$|The Red Raiders' {{fans have}} set {{attendance}} records at 10 bowl games, including the team's first bowl game {{appearance in the}} 1938 Sun Bowl. Although 8 of the 10 attendance records were eventually broken, attendance records from 2 bowl game appearances, the 2004 Pacific Life Holiday Bowl and 2009 AT Cotton Bowl Classic, remain <b>unbroken.</b> The 2009 AT Cotton Bowl Classic's attendance record of 88,175 was the second-most attended bowl game of the 2008–09 bowl game season.|$|E
5|$|The church records {{include an}} <b>unbroken</b> list of rectors {{dating back to}} 1302, {{during the reign of}} King EdwardI. One notable rector was John Dee, who served from early 1568 until the year 1574, {{although}} he was probably never a permanent resident. Dee, a noted mathematician, astrologer, alchemist and astronomer, was on friendly terms with the ruling monarch, Queen ElizabethI, and had given her astrological advice for setting the date of her coronation.|$|E
5|$|The most {{essential}} change {{consisted of a}} more monumental composition. The temple had been enlarged considerably and given a more stern shape, and the figures had been more closely assembled and they formed an <b>unbroken</b> relief-like row. The sketch was put on exhibition in the museum in November 1913 and {{in a letter to}} Ludvig Looström, the director of the museum, Larsson offered the painting for 35,000 Swedish kronor.|$|E
5|$|Unlike humans, horses do {{not sleep}} in a solid, <b>unbroken</b> period of time, but take many short periods of rest. Horses spend four to fifteen {{hours a day in}} {{standing}} rest, and from a few minutes to several hours lying down. Total sleep time in a 24-hour period may range from several minutes to a couple of hours, mostly in short intervals of about 15minutes each. The average sleep time of a domestic horse is said to be 2.9 hours per day.|$|E
5|$|Zaculeu {{was first}} {{occupied}} in the Early Classic Period (AD250600), and the buildings from this era show the architectural {{influence of the}} great metropolis of Teotihuacán in the Valley of Mexico. The largest constructions date from the Classic Period (AD250900). To these were added other plaza groups and buildings in the Early Postclassic (AD9001200) and Late Postclassic (AD12001525) in an <b>unbroken</b> history. Zaculeu {{has been used as}} a ceremonial site by Mam Maya continuously to the present.|$|E
5|$|As the Japanese regrouped {{west of the}} Matanikau, the U.S. forces {{concentrated}} on shoring up and strengthening their Lunga defenses. On 14 September, Vandegrift moved another battalion, the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment (3/2), from Tulagi to Guadalcanal. On 18 September, an Allied naval convoy delivered 4,157 men from the 3rd Provisional Marine Brigade (the U.S. 7th Marine Regiment augmented by additional support units) to Guadalcanal. These reinforcements allowed Vandegrift—beginning on 19 September—to establish an <b>unbroken</b> line of defense around the Lunga perimeter. Vandegrift's forces' next significant clashes with the Japanese occurred along the Matanikau River from 23–27 September and 6–9 October.|$|E
5|$|For {{purposes}} of geophysical and oceanographic research {{and to determine}} habitability, endurance and psychological stress – all extremely important to the Polaris program – it had been decided that a rapid round-the-world trip, touching the areas of interest, should be conducted. Maximum stability of the observing platform and <b>unbroken</b> continuity around the world were important. Additionally, for reasons of the national interest it had been decided that the voyage should be made entirely submerged undetected by our own or other forces and completed as soon as possible. TRITON, because of her size, speed and extra dependability of her two-reactor plant, had been chosen for the mission.|$|E
5|$|Gum-digging was {{the major}} source of income for {{settlers}} in Northland, and farmers often worked the gumfields in the winter months to subsidise the poor income from their <b>unbroken</b> land. By the 1890s, 20,000 people were engaged in gum-digging, of which 7000 worked full-time. Gum-digging was not restricted to settlers or workers in the rural areas; Auckland families would cross the Waitematā Harbour by ferry at weekends to dig in the fields around Birkenhead, causing damage to public roads and private farms, and leading to local council management of the problem.|$|E
5|$|Houses at Noel Park were {{deliberately}} {{designed to}} be relatively small, both for cheapness and to discourage tenants from taking on lodgers. Many of the larger houses at Shaftesbury Park had been sublet and split, and the practice went against {{the principles of the}} Artizans Company's founders. To discourage the practice at Queen's Park and Noel Park, cottage flats were built; these maintained the terraced façade, but split the house into upper and lower flats, each flat having a separate front door onto the street. Many properties, particularly on the central Gladstone Avenue, were built in this style; this maintained the <b>unbroken</b> façade of the first-class houses, but allowed large numbers of smaller and low-income families to be housed.|$|E
5|$|In his Botanical Gardens and Botanical Literature in the Eighteenth Century (1961), Stearn {{provides}} {{some insight into}} his interpretation of botanical history: The progress of botany, as of other sciences, comes from the interaction of so many factors that undue emphasis on any one can give a very distorted impression of the whole, but certainly {{among the most important}} of these for any given period are the prevailing ideas and intellectual attitudes, the assumptions and stimuli of the time, for often upon them depends the extent to which a particular study attracts an <b>unbroken</b> succession of men of industry and originality intent on building a system of knowledge and communicating it successfully to others of like mind.|$|E
5|$|Lovato {{also stated}} that her struggles with addictions not only caused her to nearly {{overdose}} several times, but later began to impact her ability to perform and promote her third studio album <b>Unbroken,</b> referencing a 2012 performance on the eleventh season of American Idol where she was severely hungover. After her management team had expressed their intentions to leave her, Lovato agreed to resume treatment and counseling for her addictions, leading to her move to a sober-living facility in Los Angeles with roommates and responsibilities to help her overcome her drug and alcohol struggles.|$|E
5|$|No {{conclusive}} proof of wrongdoing {{has come to}} light, though other aspects of Norris's financial dealings unrelated to the promotion controversy have fuelled speculation on the matter; Norris resigned as chairman and left the club in 1929, having been found guilty by the Football Association of financial irregularities; he {{was found to have}} misused his expenses account, and to have pocketed the proceeds of the sale of the Arsenal team bus. Regardless of the circumstances of their promotion in 1919, Arsenal have remained in the top division since then, and as a result hold the English record for the longest <b>unbroken</b> stretch of top-flight football.|$|E
