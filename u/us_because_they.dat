25|$|Galen {{is one of}} {{the most}} famous {{scholars}} and physicians of classical antiquity. Today, the original texts of some of his works, and details of his biography, are lost, and are only known to <b>us</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were translated into Arabic. Jabir ibn Hayyan frequently cites Galen's books, which were available in early Arabic translations. In 872 AD, Ya'qubi refers to some of Galens works. The titles of the books he mentions differ from those chosen by Hunayn ibn Ishāq for his own translations, thus suggesting earlier translations must have existed. Hunayn frequently mentions in his comments on works which he had translated that he considered earlier translations as insufficient, and had provided completely new translations. Early translations might have been available before the 8th century; most likely they were translated from Syrian or Persian.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{they have}} written exhaustively on this topic, {{and their work}} did not reach us. There are many sciences. There have been {{numerous}} sages among the nations of mankind. The knowledge that has not come down to us {{is larger than the}} knowledge that has. Where are the sciences of the Persians that ‘Umar ordered to be wiped out {{at the time of the}} conquest? Where are the sciences of the Chaladaeans, the Syrians and the Babylonians, and the scholarly products and results that were theirs? Where are the sciences of the Copts, their predecessors? The sciences of only one nation, the Greeks, have come down to <b>us,</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were translated through Al-Ma'mun's efforts. He was successful in this direction because he had many translators at his disposal and spent much money in this connection.|$|E
25|$|These bats live {{in caves}} {{throughout}} the whole year and prefer caves surrounded by oak-hickory forest. They are usually located in mountainous limestone regions. During the maternity period the female bats stay in the caves. Most male bats don’t stay with the female bats during this period. They aren’t migratory and usually stay close to their caves. In the winter this species hibernates rather than migrates. Usually these bats only leave to hunt for food.They are nocturnal hunters and feeders. In Virginia they are known to hunt in fields and in Kentucky they are known to hunt by cliffs. Research shows that hunting patterns are very varied. They use their sonar to see insects while flying {{on the edges of}} the forests where they hunt. They benefit <b>us</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> hunt harmful insects. They hunt for insects such as: small moths, beetles, flies, lacewings, bees and wasps.|$|E
5000|$|The great {{legacies}} of any culture - whether their creators be called Aeschylus, Shakespeare, Cervantes, Kafka or Picasso - move <b>us</b> today <b>because</b> <b>they</b> present {{man with his}} problems, his pains and his joys, which are far more lasting than his social, political or economic condition.|$|R
5000|$|Some Indian Americans {{who were}} {{unfamiliar}} with the ethnonymic conventions used in the United States, mistakenly {{indicated that they were}} [...] "American Indian" [...] as their race in the 1990 <b>US</b> Census, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were unaware that this term is used in the United States to refer to Native Americans.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the great}} things about editing the journal of the American Judges Association is that you can ask some of the leading experts in various legal fields to write {{articles}} for <b>us,</b> and <b>because</b> <b>they</b> will be speaking directly to judges, they usually agree. Our lead article in this issue is a great example...|$|R
500|$|This season's episodes were {{produced}} {{in a process}} {{similar to those of}} the previous season. Each episode was outlined in two-to-three pages that contained the necessary plot information. These outlines were then handed to storyboard artists, who created full storyboards. Design and coloring were done in Burbank, California, and animation was handled overseas in South Korea by Rough Draft Korea or Saerom Animation. The season was storyboarded and written by Cole Sanchez, Rebecca Sugar, Tom Herpich, Skyler Page, Ako Castuera, Moynihan, Bert Youn, Somvilay Xayaphone, and Steve Wolfhard. Ward was proud with the writing staff for the season, saying, [...] "Everyone [...] is super talented [...] And they're all a bunch of brainiacs, super smart". He explained that [...] "They're amazing in helping <b>us</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> let us write really cool ideas [...] they're really supportive, is what I am trying to say, of what we're trying to do." [...] The season was produced by Cartoon Network Studios and Frederator Studios.|$|E
500|$|In {{an attempt}} to solve their problem in finding a {{reliable}} opening partnership in the series, England promoted Verity to open the batting in the fourth Test. After Australia were bowled out for 288, Verity and Barnett put on 53runs together, England's best opening partnership of the series. Wisden praised Verity's defence but {{said he had not}} solved the problem of finding a partner for Barnett. England scored 330 but Australia's second innings of 433 left England needing 392. Barnett and Verity began with a stand of 45, but England lost by 148 runs. In two innings, Verity scored 19 and 17, but was wicketless in the match. Having levelled the series, Australia won the final match by a large margin to take the series 3–2. Verity took just one wicket in the match. In the series, he took 10wickets at an average of 45.50; in all first-class matches in Australia, he captured 28wickets at 30.75 and secured 10wickets at 18.20 in two matches in New Zealand {{at the end of the}} tour. The Wisden report on the tour said: [...] "Verity admirably performed the task of keeping one end closed and took high honours for his consistently good work." [...] The Times correspondent, noting the failure of the wrist spinners selected to tour, wrote: [...] "Australia... beat <b>us</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> have spin bowlers who make the ball truly spin. Verity certainly never had a wicket on which to demonstrate his art, so exposing the fact that real spin bowling does not at the moment exist in England." ...|$|E
2500|$|The next day, the Chinese leader saw {{a report}} from the PLA General Staff’s Operations Department {{describing}} rebellions by Tibetans in Sichuan, Yunnan, Gansu, and Qinghai. He again stressed that “rebellions like these are extremely favorable for <b>us</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> will benefit us in helping to train our troops, train the people, and provide a sufficient reason to crush the rebellion and carry out comprehensive reforms in the future.” ...|$|E

Virginia State Board of Elections in a Virginia state court, plaintiffs {{sought to}} {{overturn}} the General Assembly's redistricting in five House of Delegate and six state Senate districts as violations of both the Virginia and <b>U.S.</b> Constitutions <b>because</b> <b>they</b> failed to represent populations in [...] "continuous and compact territory".|$|R
50|$|Analytic {{observations}} give <b>us</b> new knowledge, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> reveal unsuspected {{implications of}} our statements and beliefs.

2500|$|Foreign {{companies}} with Level 3 programs will often issue {{materials that are}} more informative and are more accommodating to their <b>U.S.</b> shareholders <b>because</b> <b>they</b> rely on them for capital. Overall, foreign {{companies with}} a Level3 program set up are the easiest on which to find information. [...] Examples include Vodafone, Petrobras, and China Information Technology, Inc. (CNIT).|$|R
2500|$|... “How comes it {{that our}} French {{brothers}} {{have done so}} much compared with <b>us?</b> <b>Because</b> <b>they</b> are organized into one compact mass, which, {{under the guidance of}} competent leaders, moves like an army of well-disciplined soldiers, steadily onward to a given point. That is the reason of it. Frenchmen have the instinct of military discipline. We, on the other hand, carry the Saxon principle of the local management and the infinitesimal division of interests, too far. Absolutely this will not do in fighting a battle.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{data showed}} crime was {{decreasing}} nationally, a 25–26 July Forum Research poll for the National Post suggested that Canadians believed otherwise. The recent mass shootings and media coverage had a majority fearing [...] "a violent crime wave". Pamela Rutledge, a media researcher studying the psychological impact of news coverage, {{stated that the}} apparent randomness of the crimes could lead to this perception. [...] "They really trigger a sense of fear in <b>us</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> aren't explainable [...] There's no way of making sense of it or figuring out why it didn't happen to me. So that anxiety accelerates your sense of danger." ...|$|E

50|$|A RAND study {{concluded}} that the total federal cost of providing medical expenses for the 78% illegal immigrants without health insurance coverage was $1.1 billion, with immigrants paying $321 million of health care costs out-of-pocket. The study found that illegal immigrants tend to visit physicians less frequently than <b>U.S.</b> citizens <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are younger and because people with chronic health problems {{are less likely to}} migrate.|$|R
50|$|Green fireballs are {{a type of}} {{unidentified}} {{flying object}} which have been sighted in the sky since the late 1940s. Early sightings primarily occurred in the southwestern United States, particularly in New Mexico. They were once of notable concern to the <b>US</b> government <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were often clustered around sensitive research and military installations, such as Los Alamos and Sandia National Laboratory, then Sandia base.|$|R

50|$|Established in 1952, the U.S. Army Special Forces Command (Airborne), {{also known}} as the Green Berets, was {{established}} as a special operations force of the United States Army tasked with five primary missions: unconventional warfare, foreign internal defense, special reconnaissance, direct action, and counter-terrorism. These missions make special forces unique in the <b>U.S.</b> military, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are employed throughout the three stages of the operational continuum: peacetime, conflict and war.|$|R

Although Russia faces many obstacles to becoming a credible Asian actor, Moscow is making resolute diplomatic overtures to secure its Asian standing.

The band failed to maintain popular success in the UK and <b>US,</b> partly <b>because</b> <b>they</b> did not fit into contemporary trends. They nevertheless earned a devoted cult following.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{the venture}} into carpet {{manufacturing}} {{proved to be}} ill-advised for the company.
