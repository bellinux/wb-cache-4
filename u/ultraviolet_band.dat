50|$|In 1969, Chi Carinae was {{classified}} as chemically peculiar Ap star because its absorption lines of silicon appeared unusually strong relative to the lines for helium. However, subsequent examination in the <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>band</b> showed the silicon bands were as expected and it was determined the spectra is normal for a star of its type. There is no indication of variability in the star's spectrum. Observation during the Hipparcos mission showed no photometric variability down to a limit of ±0.003 magnitudes. For this reason, the star has been ruled out as a Beta Cephei type variable star.|$|E

50|$|Lyman {{continuum}} photons (abbrev. LyC), shortened to Ly continuum photons or Lyc photon, are the photons {{emitted from}} stars at photon energies above the Lyman limit. Hydrogen is ionized by absorbing LyC. Working off of Victor Schumann's discovery of ultraviolet light, from 1906 to 1914, Theodore Lyman observed that atomic hydrogen absorbs light only at specific frequencies (or wavelengths) and the Lyman series is thus named after him. All the wavelengths in the Lyman series {{are in the}} <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>band.</b> This quantized absorption behavior occurs only up to an energy limit, known as the ionization energy. In the case of neutral atomic hydrogen, the minimum ionization energy {{is equal to the}} Lyman limit, where the photon has enough energy to completely ionize the atom, resulting in a free proton and a free electron. Above this energy (below this wavelength), all wavelengths of light may be absorbed. This forms a continuum in the energy spectrum; the spectrum is continuous rather than composed of many discrete lines, which are seen at lower energies.|$|E
50|$|The {{charge-coupled}} devices (CCDs) in the WFPC2 (designed at JPL {{and manufactured}} by Loral) detected electromagnetic radiation {{in a range}} from 120 nm to 1000 nm. This included the 380 nm to 780 nm of the visible spectrum, all of the near ultraviolet (and {{a small part of}} the extreme <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>band)</b> and most of the near infrared band. The sensitivity distribution of these CCDs is roughly normal, with a peak around 700 nm and concomitantly very poor sensitivity at the extremes of the CCDs' operating range. WFPC2 featured four identical CCD detectors, each 800x800 pixels. Three of these, arranged in an L-formation, comprise Hubble's Wide Field Camera (WFC). Adjacent to them is the Planetary Camera (PC), a fourth CCD with different (narrower-focused) optics. This afforded a more detailed view over a smaller region of the visual field. WFC and PC images are typically combined, producing the WFPC2's characteristic stairstep image. When distributed as non-scientific JPEG files the PC portion of the image is shown with the same resolution as the WFC portions, but astronomers receive a raw scientific image package which presents the PC image in its native, higher detail.|$|E

Both emissions decay in a timescale of a few ns under pulsed excitation, however the blue band could also be observed in slow recombination processes and it afterglows in about 100 s at the end of steady-state excitation.

As material is drawn into the outer parts of this disk, it becomes photoionized, producing broad emission lines in the optical and <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>bands</b> of the electromagnetic spectrum. A wind of ionized matter, organized in filamentary structures at distances of 1-14 light days from the center, is flowing outward in the direction perpendicular to the accretion disk plane.|$|R
