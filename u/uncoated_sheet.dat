Results from the OSU Formability Test were also compared with standard limiting dome height (LDH) tests and with finite element simulations.

Moreover, there is good correlation between formability evaluated using the two tests.

40|$|The {{frictional}} {{behavior of}} a number of conventional tool materials used in the sheet forming industry has been studied by a recently developed tribotester based on flat-die strip drawing. The main objective was to study the frictional performance of the materials and correlate the tribological behavior mainly to the microstructure. Tooling materials tested ranged from powder metallurgical tool steels to nodular cast iron as well as a novel abrasion-resistant cast iron, Carbide steel. A high strength <b>uncoated</b> <b>sheet</b> material commonly used in sheet forming applications was used as a reference sheet material in all tests. The microstructural characterizations of the tool materials were done by SEM image analysis and XRD analysis. Surface roughness characterization was done by 3 D optical analysis.

This fact evidences {{the importance of this}} welding process control, due to its efficiency, productivity speediness and straightforward simple automation. This work aimed to study the weldability of zinc coated and <b>uncoated</b> steel <b>sheets</b> for automotive industry, comparing the performance of two welding equipments with two current outputkinds: alternating current (AC) and medium frequency direct current (DC). The welding parameters were kept constant: 260 kgf (force), 150 ms (time) and 7. 0 kA (welding current), based upon an optimization parameters methodology. The joints were characterized using optical metallography (spot diameter, indentation depth and weld penetration depth), mechanical tensile-shear tests and electrical measurements: contact electrical resistance, dynamic resistance and dynamic energy. The results showed that welding in medium frequency direct current was more efficient in generating heat in zinc coated <b>sheets</b> and <b>uncoated</b> <b>sheets</b> than alternating current equipment. In welding using AC and DC equipments in zinc coated sheets, the spot weld time formation was 25 ms longer than <b>uncoated</b> steel <b>sheets</b> spot weld time. The burn of zinc during welding did not damage the spot weld formation with AC or DC equipments. The electrical contact resistance increased with the roughnessand also presented 52 % higher in <b>uncoated</b> <b>sheets</b> than in zinc coated sheets. Finally, the increase in dynamicresistance and dynamic energy augmented the spot weld diameter for both welding equipments.

40|$|Lack of {{international}} comparability in crude steel prices presents {{a problem in}} constructing an econometric model of the global steel market. The commonly used measures of crude steel prices are the weighted average of the prices of steel products and the index of the weighted average of prices based on a certain year. But {{in the context of}} constructing an econometric model of the global steel market, these measures are not comparable internationally. If the various product prices are cointegrated, it is appropriate to use the price of the most widely produced and traded product in the model (<b>uncoated</b> steel <b>sheet)</b> as an indicator of the general movement of crude steel prices. This paper concludes that the price of <b>uncoated</b> steel <b>sheet</b> cointegrates with the prices of other steel products in France and Germany. The same is not true of the United States, which may point to quality problems with the price data. Use of the price data of <b>uncoated</b> steel <b>sheet</b> as the indicator of crude steel prices in the global steel model would thus seem appropriate for capturing long-term price movements of various steel products.

40|$|AbstractThe {{influence}} of the processing conditions (cooling rate) and coating on the physicochemical properties of thermoplastic starch/poly(lactic acid) blend sheets was studied. Two cooling rates were used: fast and slow, and {{in the latter case}} the sheets were both non-coated and coated with cross-linked chitosan. The physicochemical properties investigated were crystallinity, morphology, water affinity (moisture sorption isotherm, water vapor permeability, water solubility and contact angle) and mechanical properties. In general, the sheets cooled at the slow rate were more crystalline, less permeable and less soluble in water than those cooled at the fast rate. They also produced a more homogeneous morphology. The coated sheets were less soluble in water and mechanically stronger than <b>uncoated</b> <b>sheets</b> cooled at the slow rate. The concentration of plasticizer in the TPS affected only the sorption isotherm and contact angle since a higher plasticizer content caused a greater affinity for water...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBlends of {{thermoplastic}} starch (TPS) and poly(lactic acid) (PLA) (70 / 30 TPS/PLA wt/wt) were thermopressed {{to produce}} biodegradable sheets. These sheets were coated with cross-linked chitosan by two different methods: spraying and immersion. The coated sheets presented a more irregular surface than uncoated samples, which {{was associated with}} the chitosan reticulation. The chitosan coating reduced the water solubility and the water vapor permeability of the sheets due to being less hygroscopic. Coated sheets were more rigid and had higher tensile strength than <b>uncoated</b> <b>sheets,</b> because the cross-linking joins the macromolecules covalently, reducing the mobility of the chains. Higher glycerol concentration in the TPS increased the elongation at break due to the glycerol plasticizing effect. Coating by spraying was more effective at changing the sheet properties than coating by immersion, and this technique can be used to reduce the hydrophilic character of biodegradable films, allowing their use as packaging materials...|$|R
40|$|A study {{examining}} {{the effect of}} coatings on the quality and behaviour of self-piercing riveted joints between aluminium and steel sheets was conducted. NG 5754 and AA 5182 aluminium and {{high strength low alloy}} (HSLA) steel were used for this investigation. Two types of coatings, E-coat and zinc plate were applied to the HSLA steel and AA 5182 aluminium sheets. The results showed that the presence of a coating on the surface of HSLA and AA 5182 affected the joint quality in terms of head height, interlock distance and remaining material thickness. Examination of joint sections indicated that the self-piercing riveting process needed different setting parameters for coated and <b>uncoated</b> <b>sheets</b> in order to achieve optimum setting conditions. The study has also shown that both the E-coat and zinc plate coatings affected the joint strength and the failure mechanism under static loading conditions. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The roughening behavior of coated aluminium sheets can substantially differ from that of <b>uncoated</b> <b>sheets</b> of the same substrate material owing to the mechanical properties of the coatings.

40|$|Five {{corrosion}} protective painls, {{including three}} used as on-rust ones, were tested for their anticorrosive effects at the outdoor exposure test yard of University of the Ryukyus, beginning on September 1, 1988. First, clean JIS SS 41 mild steel plates of 15 x 15 cm x 3. 2 mm each were exposed outdoor for 3 months,then they were removed {{of the resulting}} rust {{by means of a}} wire brush to retain slight rust. These specimens together with new plate specimens which were cleaned by grit blasting to retain no rust, were coated with the same protective paints. In addition, three kinds of <b>uncoated</b> steel <b>sheets</b> (JIS SS 41 mild steel, JIS SPCD cold rolled carbon steel and JIS SPA - H weathering steel), and two kinds of zinc coated steel plates (JIS SGCC hot dip zinc coated steel and zinc hot dip galvanized mild steel) were used as the specimens to obtain the atmospheric corrosion data. The results obtained by this outdoor exposure test are as follows. 1) After 6 month exposure, the three kinds of <b>uncoated</b> steel <b>sheets</b> showed equal corrosion rates of about 10 mg/dm^ 2 /day. Their corroded conditions were also equal to each other. The two kinds of zinc coated steel plates were increased in weight slightly due to oxidation of zinc. 2) Both the specimens coated with protective paints on their surfaces with slight rust and with no rust, respectively, showed no fault and no difference in their appearance. All paints coated on the surfaces with no rust showed good adhesive strength, and onc on-rust paints showed poor adhesive strength. 3) The results of cross cut test were nearly the same as those of pull off test, except when the overcoatability between the undercoat and the top coat was poor. 4) The impact strength of the coated paints in the initial stage was poorer than that after exposure.

40|$|International audienceThe {{success of}} many sheet forming {{operations}} depends critically on the friction {{of the sheet}} on the blankholder. First we review briefly the various frictional mechanisms involved and discuss mainly the occurrence of hydrodynamic effects at macroscopic and microscopic scales, {{especially with regard to}} the experimental work performed by Emmens (Proc. 15 th Bienn. Congr. IDDRG, Dearborn, MI, May 1988, ASM International, 1988, pp. 63 – 70). Then we describe the results of friction measurements performed with a tribometer on four low carbon steel sheets: two high formability sheets with electro-discharge texture and laser-textured roughness, a high strength sheet and a hot dip-galvanized sheet with laser-textured roughness; friction tests were performed between two flat tools at two contact pressures p (about 10 – 30 MPa), two sliding speeds V (about 2 – 60 mm s− 1) and along the rolling direction and the transverse direction. The friction of the galvanized sheet is rather isotropic and decreases markedly as the ratio V/p increases; in contrast, the friction of the <b>uncoated</b> <b>sheets</b> is anisotropic and its decrease as V/p increases is smaller. Observations by optical microscopy of the surface of the sheets after friction testings provide three major results: a small decrease in the friction coefficient μ corresponds generally to a more marked decrease in the final plateaux area. At very low value of the Vp ratio where hydrodynamic effects cannot occur friction is the sum of two mechanisms: at a very small scale the formation of waves, with moderate friction μ ≈ 0. 12, and at the greater scale of the plateaux of the sheet surface shearing of transfer film, with higher friction μ ≈ 0. 22; the extent of each mechanism depends on the sheet roughness texture. As the ratio V/p increases the viscosity of the lubricant promotes the formation of a very thin lubricant film (thickness 10 – 70 nm) on the plateaux which slightly reduces the friction coefficient and more markedly the extent of the two previous mechanisms and the associated surface damage of the sheet and tool surface. This effect is effective before the generation of pressure by viscous shearing of oil pockets proposed by Emmens and responsible of a very marked decrease in friction at high values of the V/p ratio...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a study on the}} {{corrosion}} behaviour and performance between coated and <b>uncoated</b> steel <b>sheets</b> which are used in car body manufacturing.

The corrosion behaviour was determined by analyzing the surface and cross section of the samples by using scanning electron microscope whereas the corrosion performance was determined by mass loss method and visual examination. From the analysis it was found that for all three models the uncoated samples were attacked by uniform corrosion. Model 1 showed the best corrosion performance; followed by Model 2 and Model 3.

40|$|Abstract. Strengthening {{of glass}} sheets {{through the process}} of ion {{exchange}} have been widely used in thinner cover glass for smart phone. The compressive stress improves the ability of the glass surface to withstand damage from mechanical impact. However, the presence of the damage resistant layer makes conventional mechanical and laser cutting of the ion-exchanged glass difficult. Normally, the cutting process will lead to spontaneous glass sheet breakage or shattering. Even successful in some samples, the underlying central tension is exposed on the edge, and the mechanical strength and durability of this edge is degraded. The repair of edge cracks becomes an extremely important issue for the development of single glass based smart phone. The ion exchanged glass plates (Corning IOX-FS) with a thickness of 0. 7 mm were selected as the substrate materials. After cutting ion exchanged glass by high penetration diamond scribing wheels, the edge of glass plates can be protected or strengthened with silica sol using roll coating process. It was observed that the strength could be improved achieving 210 % compared to the strength of <b>uncoated</b> glass <b>sheets.</b> The sol-gel coating could improve the strength of the glass mainly by the mechanisms of filling in edge flaws or blunting crack tips.

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{substrates}} {{have been used}} for fabrication of microchips for DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and DNA fragment separation, including the more conventional glass and silicon as well as alternative polymer-based materials. Polyester represents one such polymer, and the laser-printing of toner onto polyester films {{has been shown to be}} effective for generating polyester-toner (PeT) microfluidic devices with channel depths on the order of tens of micrometers. Here, we describe a novel and simple process that allows for the production of multilayer, high aspect-ratio PeT microdevices with substantially larger channel depths. This innovative process utilizes a CO(2) laser to create the microchannel in polyester sheets containing a uniform layer of printed toner, and multilayer devices can easily be constructed by sandwiching the channel layer between <b>uncoated</b> cover <b>sheets</b> of polyester containing precut access holes. The process allows the fabrication of deep channels, with similar to 270 mu m, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of multilayer PeT microchips for dynamic solid phase extraction (dSPE) and PCR amplification. With the former, we found that (i) more than 65 % of DNA from 0. 6 mu L of blood was recovered, (ii) the resultant DNA was concentrated to greater than 3 ng/mu L., (which was better than other chip-based extraction methods), and (iii) the DNA recovered was compatible with downstream microchip-based PCR amplification. Illustrative of the compatibility of PeT microchips with the PCR process, the successful amplification of a 520 bp fragment of lambda-phage DNA in a conventional thermocycler is shown. The ability to handle the diverse chemistries associated with DNA purification and extraction is a testimony to the potential utility of PeT microchips beyond separations and presents a promising new disposable platform for genetic analysis that is low cost and easy to fabricate.

40|$|Department of Mechanical EngineeringIn the {{automotive}} industry, zinc-coated steel {{is widely used}} because of its high corrosion resistance. Many automotive industry companies have tried to employ laser welding because of its many benefits, such as low heat input, high-intensity heat source, minimal distortion in heat affected zones, and high productivity. In lap joint laser welding of zinc-coated steel sheets, a proper gap needs to be maintained to avoid weld defects in weldment because the zinc vaporization temperature (1180 K) {{is lower than the}} steel melting temperature (1809 K). However, in this case, additional processes are required for application to actual industrial production lines, {{and it is difficult to}} precisely control the gap. Furthermore, although many researchers have investigated ways to mitigate the influence of high zinc vaporization pressure, it remains an issue because of erratic and unstable keyhole motion and melt pool behavior. Therefore, the purpose of this dissertation is to investigate the keyhole behavior and weldability of zero-gap laser welding of zinc-coated and <b>uncoated</b> steel <b>sheets</b> at atmospheric and subatmospheric pressures according to process parameters to develop the gap insensitive lap joint laser welding of zinc-coated steel. In this dissertation, firstly, a scaling law for predicting penetration depth was proposed, because the determination of penetration depth is the first consideration before the welding process. Moreover, then precisely observation method and analysis method were developed to observe clearly keyhole behavior, and effect of relative configuration of the laser beam and keyhole geometry on weldability for zero-gap lap laser welding of zinc-coated steel sheets. Also, the influence of ambient pressure on keyhole behavior and weldability were investigated to find solutions and possibilities for obtaining good welds for zero-gap lap laser welding of zinc-coated steel sheets by adjusting processing parameters (i. e. laser intensity and welding speed and ambient pressures). These studies can be summarized as follows. Firstly, a scaling law for predicting penetration depth was proposed that can be applied to both conduction mode and keyhole mode laser welding. The proposed scaling law was formulated based on a simple one-dimensional heat conduction model, and the effect of multiple reflections was accounted for. Because the scaling law was obtained from a laser heating problem, its physical meaning and why it needs to be formulated that way can be clearly explained. Experiments were conducted, and the obtained results were found to be in good agreement with the proposed scaling law. Secondly, in order to observe the keyhole behavior and reconstruct the keyhole geometry, a coaxial observation method was developed using a high-speed camera. A coaxial observation is a more useful and precise method to observe keyhole behavior than other lateral observation methods, and it was possible to study how the keyhole shape changes as the process parameters are varied. This chapter investigated the overall differences in the keyhole geometry between the zinc-coated and uncoated steels over a large process parameter space. Thirdly, using the obtained keyhole geometry data, the effect of keyhole geometry and dynamics on weldability was investigated by defining several key factors. It was found that the relative configuration of the keyhole and the laser beam is the most influential factor for obtaining good welds. For the zinc-coated steel, good welds were obtained at low welding speeds even zero-gap lap joint laser welding of zinc-coated steel sheets. Finally, based on the observation and analysis method from previous chapters, we investigated the laser welding of zinc-coated steel at subatmospheric pressures in order to compare between laser welding at atmospheric pressure and subatmospheric pressure. The purpose of this work is because the pressures inside the keyhole play a major role in weldability during zero-gap lap joint laser welding of the zinc-coated steel sheets. In this chapter, the main focus was to reconstruct time-averaged 3 -D keyhole shapes and studying the influence of ambient pressures on keyhole behavior and weldability. ope...|$|R
