This percentage split is likely to change with the start of FTZ, envisioned {{to be similar to}} the Jebel Ali Free Zone (Jafza), UAE. With it, the new Port of Baku will act as a major logistics hub in Central Eurasia, serving both European and Asian markets, as well as being part of an extensive international logistics network linking Europe and Asia. In particular, Port of Baku will trade & become the major centre for consolidation, concentration and distribution, providing a wide range of value-added services in the region to the markets of the South Caucasus, Central Asia, Iran, southern Russia and Turkey. There are a significant number of activities that can be classified as value-added services in the field of logistics. Generally, they fall into two categories:• General Logistics Services, including storage, loading and unloading, stripping, <b>unstuffing,</b> groupage, consolidation and distribution.• Value-Added Logistics (VAL), including repackaging, customizing, assembly, quality control, testing, repair, on-terminal, auto-accessorizing, grain storage and fumigating, news print storage, storage of commodities and transfer and in-container garment assembly.General value-added services include services such as the maintenance, renting and leasing of equipment, cleaning facilities, tanking, safety, security services, offices and information and communication services of various kinds. VAL activities, in particular, are growing in importance as producers concentrate on meeting the demands of customers for high quality specialized products. New players in this field of third party logistics services providers will be attracted to the Port of Baku at Alat to take over parts of the production chain (assembly, quality control, customizing, packaging and others) and of the after-sales services (including repair and re-use).FTZ would be in a natural position to participate in this logistics niche. It will be linked to other Caspian ports via high quality maritime connections through the New Port of Baku at Alat, and intermodal road and rail transport services from Alat to Georgia, Iran, Turkey, Russia and southeast Europe, while also providing air freight services from Baku International Airport.The activity in FTZ will create an additional volume of cargo aimed at exports. The majority of these cargoes is likely to be transported in containers via the various intermodal forms of transport.|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} k-value {{degradation}} (plasma damage) {{is a key}} issue for the integration, and it is becoming more challenging as the dielectric constant of low-k materials scales down. One way to circumvent this issue is temporarily conversion of low-k material from a porous to a dense state by filling the pores with a sacrificial polymer after the deposition and curing of the low-k material. A detailed process scheme for the pore stuffing and postetch polymer removal of PMMA is described in this work. The filling temperature was optimized according to the molecular weight of the PMMA. To remove the polymer after plasma-etching in a purely thermal environment, a temperature of at least 430 [*]°C had to be applied. Annealing assisted by variable frequency microwaves could remove the polymer already at 380 [*]°C and with a He–H 2 afterglow plasma the polymer could be removed at 280 [*]°C. Laser annealing allowed the removal at a stage temperature of 200 [*]°C with an only surface-limited heating of about 500 [*]°C and higher to prevent the FEOL structures from damage.

40|$|Micro- and meso-porous {{materials}} {{have been widely}} studied for application in catalysis, gas separation, sensors, optics and so on. In semiconductor manufacturing, porous materials are also considered as inter-metal insulators with low dielectric constant (low-k) for ultra-large-scale integration (ULSI) interconnects. Various types of porous materials, including silica, pure polymer and metal organic framework, have been studied for interconnect applications. As critical dimensions scale down, advanced interconnects require low-k dielectrics {{in order to reduce}} power dissipation and resistance-capacitance (RC) signal delay. For porous organosilicate glass (p-OSG) materials, the currently most successful low-k candidate family, the material synthesis is well understood. The precursors, i. e. the silica matrix and the porogen, are co-deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) or sol-gel method. The porogen is then selectively removed, by annealing or (ultraviolet) UV-cure, to form a meso-porous structure. As such, continuous k value reduction is easily achieved by increasing the porogen/matrix ratio so as to generate higher open porosity. However, a larger porosity is generally accompanied by increased pore size. Highly porous structures lead to a low compatibility with conventional interconnect integration processing, for example, heterogeneous deposition, plasma processing and chemical mechanical planarization (CMP). Among them, low-k degradation by plasma etching and deposition of metal diffusion barrier is the most severe challenge. Plasma induced damage (PID) is mainly due to the penetration of etch radicals, photons and residues into the interconnected pores, resulting in a modified low-k structure and composition deep into the bulk. The loss of organic groups turns the pore sidewalls hydrophilic and subsequent moisture adsorption degrades the dielectric properties and reliability. Likewise, the penetration of metal-based species during physical-vapor or chemical-vapor deposition of the metal diffusion barrier causes issues of barrier continuity, leakage and effective dielectric constant. The ‘effective’ k-values for integrated inter-metal dielectrics are significantly higher than those of pristine materials. The increasing pore size also requires thicker barriers, which have such high resistivity that, for narrow lines, the use of Cu as metal does not allow anymore to reach the target line resistance. As a result, the integration of ultra-porous low-k dielectrics by state-of-the-art damascene technology meets huge challenges and k-value scaling is far below expectation. In order to reduce the PID, many potential solutions have been put forward, including low damage plasma chemistry, post etch low-k repair, and post etch porogen burnout. In the meantime, several pore sealing approaches are proposed for better compatibility with deposition of metal diffusion barrier. However, all those solutions show either insufficient improvement or limited compatibility with the interconnects fabrication processes. This thesis focuses on three emerging integration strategies for advanced interconnects using ultralow-k dielectrics, namely, post porosity pore protection, pore protection by precursor condensation, and replacement low-k approach. Since both plasma damage and barrier penetration issues originate from the porous structures, the densification of porous low-k is {{the most efficient way to}} improve the integration compatibility. Post porosity pore protection (P 4) method is proposed as a solution enabling low damage integration of advanced porous low-k’s. This approach modifies the interconnect processing flow by introducing at an early stage an extrinsic sacrificial filler which suppresses the porosity of the low-k film. Pore protection process flow, including stuffing, etch and un-stuffing, has been extensively investigated in the present work. By optimization of the stuffing process conditions, various polymers can be filled successfully into p-OSG with different porosity and pore size. The penetration of polymers depends on the low-k structure, polymer properties and stuffing conditions. Temporary pore filling impedes the penetration of active radicals and the etch by-products during plasma processing. As a result, the PID is significantly decreased. Pore protection also enables defect-free metallization, which is of ultimate importance for successful integration of porous low-k’s. For this purpose, the sacrificial filler should be maintained during the whole metallization process, including the barrier deposition, Cu filling and chemical mechanical planarization (CMP). Low temperature and oxygen free de-stuffing approaches are required to avoid potential damage to the metallization structures. Pore protection can also be achieved by an alternative strategy relying on low temperature pore filling with condensed precursor reactants. Plasma etch properties of porous organo-silicate materials at cryogenic temperature is studied. The mechanism of plasma damage is investigated by means of in-situ ellipsometry and post-etch material evaluation. Using conventional volatile reactants such as SF 6, it is found that low plasma damage can be achieved below - 120 oC through two main channels: pore sidewall passivation by molecular SF 6 and partial condensation of non-volatile etch by-products. The protection can be enhanced by means of gas phase precursors with low saturated vapor pressure. Using C 4 F 8, complete pore filling is achieved at - 110 °C and negligible plasma-induced damage is demonstrated on both blanket and patterned low-k films. The characteristics of the precursor condensation process are described and discussed in detail, establishing an optimal process window. It is shown that the condensation temperature can be raised by using precursors with even lower vapor pressure. The in-situ densification through precursor condensation could enable damage-free plasma processing of mesoporous media. Compared with the P 4 approach which requires additional stuffing and de-stuffing steps, the process flow using the cryogenic etch process offers a more simple and economic route for damage-free plasma processing of porous low-k materials. Given the increasing difficulty of integrating advanced porous low-k, it makes sense to reconsider the subtractive approach, where the metal structure is defined first, followed by dielectric deposition. In spite of many research efforts on Cu direct etch and gap fill dielectric, there has been limited success in providing satisfactory morphological profile and electrical performance in technology-relevant dimensions. The present work investigates an alternative integration approach based on a “dielectric-last” scheme. The metal structure is first formed by patterning a sacrificial template material. After template removal, porous low-k dielectric is embedded into the spacing between the metal wires. The proposed method eliminates plasma-induced low-k damage, as well as barrier penetration issues. A Liquid Phase Self-Assembly low-k dielectric is used for the gap-filling purpose. By optimizing the spin coating conditions, void free gap-filling structures are achieved. The impact of low-k gap-filling process on the metal structures is investigated. The low-k porogen removal processes can induce formation of Cu 2 O and subsequent Cu migration, leading to detrimental electrical performance. Proper protection of the copper structures and tuning of the low-k curing process are thus adopted. Also, the integration scheme for dual damascene structure is explored. Formation of upper metal layers requires surface planarization on various gap-filling structures, which can be performed by chemical mechanical polishing. The surfactants present in the CMP slurry penetrate into the porous low-k, leading to dielectric degradation. A post cleaning step is therefore needed to remove the slurry residues and restore the k value to pristine level. Using a Meander-Fork integrated vehicle, the inter-metal dielectric properties are evaluated by RC and leakage current measurements. High electrical yield is obtained with integrated porous low-k showing promising effective k-values and breakdown voltages, confirming the promise of this specific integration approach.

6000|$|I {{went off}} to see cattle killed by way of {{clearing}} my head, which, as you will perceive, was getting muddled. They say every Englishman goes to the Chicago stockyards. You shall find them about six miles from the city; and once having seen them {{will never forget the}} sight. As {{far as the eye can}} reach stretches a township of cattle-pens, cunningly divided into blocks so that the animals of any pen can be speedily driven out close to an inclined timber path which leads to an elevated covered way straddling high above the pens. These viaducts are two-storied. On the upper storey tramp the doomed cattle, stolidly for the most part. On the lower, with a scuffling of sharp hooves and multitudinous yells, run the pigs. The same end is appointed for each. Thus you will see the gangs of cattle waiting their turn--as they wait sometimes for days; and they need not be distressed by the sight of their fellows running about in the fear of death. All they know is that a man on horseback causes their next-door neighbours to move by means of a whip. Certain bars and fences are unshipped, and, behold, that crowd have gone up the mouth of a sloping tunnel and return no more. It is different with the pigs. They shriek back the news of the exodus to their friends, and a hundred pens skirl responsive. It was to the pigs I first addressed myself. Selecting a viaduct which was full of them, as I could hear though I could not see, I marked a sombre building whereto it ran, and went there, not unalarmed by stray cattle who had managed to escape from their proper quarters. A pleasant smell of brine warned me of what was coming. I entered the factory and found it full of pork in barrels, and on another storey more pork unbarrelled, and in a huge room, the halves of swine for whose use great lumps of ice were being pitched in at the window. That room was the mortuary chamber where the pigs lie for a little while in state ere they begin their progress through such passages as kings may sometimes travel. Turning a corner and not noting an overhead arrangement of greased rail, wheel, and pulley, I ran into the arms of four eviscerated carcasses, all pure white and of a human aspect, being pushed by a man clad in vehement red. When I leaped aside, the floor was slippery under me. There was a flavour of farmyard in my nostrils and the shouting of a multitude in my ears. But there was no joy in that shouting! Twelve men stood in two lines--six a-side. Between them and overhead ran the railway of death that had nearly shunted me through the window. Each man carried a knife, the sleeves of his shirt were cut off at the elbows, and from bosom to heel he was blood-red. The atmosphere was stifling as a night in the Rains, by reason of the steam and the crowd. I climbed to the beginning of things and, perched upon a narrow beam, overlooked very nearly all the pigs ever bred in Wisconsin. They had just been shot out of the mouth of the viaduct and huddled together in a large pen. Thence they were flicked persuasively, a few at a time, into a smaller chamber, and there a man fixed tackle on their hinder legs so that they rose in the air suspended from the railway of death. Oh! it was then they shrieked and called on their mothers and made promises of amendment till the tackle-man punted them in their backs, and they slid head down into a brick-floored passage, very like a big kitchen sink that was blood-red. There awaited them a red man with a knife which he passed jauntily through their throats, and the full-voiced shriek became a sputter, and then a fall as of heavy tropical rain. The red man who was backed against the passage wall stood clear of the wildly kicking hoofs and passed his hand over his eyes, not from any feeling of compassion, but because the spurted blood was in his eyes, and he had barely time to stick the next arrival. Then that first stuck swine dropped, still kicking, into a great vat of boiling water, and spoke no more words, but wallowed in obedience to some unseen machinery, and presently came forth at the lower end of the vat and was heaved on the blades of a blunt paddle-wheel-thing which said, [...] "Hough! Hough! Hough!" [...] and skelped all the hair off him except what little a couple of men with knives could remove. Then he was again hitched by the heels to that said railway and passed down the line of the twelve men--each man with a knife--leaving with each man a certain amount of his individuality which was taken away in a wheel-barrow, and when he reached the last man he was very beautiful to behold, but immensely <b>unstuffed</b> and limp. Preponderance of individuality was ever a bar to foreign travel. That pig could have been in no case to visit you in India had he not parted with some of his most cherished notions.|$|R
