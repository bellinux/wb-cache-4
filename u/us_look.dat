5|$|Seattle Seahawks linebacker Mike Curtis {{blocked a}} field goal that would have sent the game into overtime, guaranteeing a Seahawk victory in what was billed as the “expansion bowl” meeting between two winless, first-year teams. The Buccaneers outgained the Seahawks, 285 yards to 253, but the {{officials}} outgained both, with 310 yards in penalties. The 35 penalties (accepted, 41 were thrown by the officials) were two short of the 25-year-old league record. Each team was penalized for holding eight times. Defensive tackle Pat Toomay complained that “the officials made <b>us</b> <b>look</b> {{like a bunch of}} idiots”. Dan Ryczek was the only Buccaneer lineman not to be called for holding. Tampa Bay running back Louis Carter, stuffed at the goal line, threw the ball to Morris Owens, who dived into the end zone for the first Buccaneer passing touchdown. A tackle by Seahawk punter Rick Engles prevented a touchdown return by Danny Reece that would have won the game for the Buccaneers. An earlier field goal try was blocked by Lyle Blackwood. The game ended with Dave Brown being helped from the field after being hit in the eye by the final penalty flag.|$|E

500|$|With rare praise, Johnson said of Pennant [...] "... he's {{the best}} {{traveller}} I ever read; he observes more things {{than anyone else}} does."

[...] Their answer was to call the 32X a [...] "transitional device" [...] between the Genesis and the Saturn, to which Bayless describes of the strategy, [...] "rankly, it just made <b>us</b> <b>look</b> greedy and dumb to consumers." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Durst, Limp Bizkit would [...] "comb {{the world}} for the illest guitar player known to man" [...] to replace Borland. After holding a {{nationwide}} audition for a new guitarist, [...] "Put Your Guitar Where Your Mouth Is", the band recorded with Snot guitarist Mike Smith. [...] "Mike brought in a breath of fresh air," [...] Durst said. [...] "Creatively, it fit like a glove. It made life easier and more positive. It made <b>us</b> <b>look</b> forward to getting together as a band so much more. The positive effect he had on me just made the whole experience of Limp Bizkit feel like a brand-new entity." [...] Before Smith replaced Borland, Durst played a great deal of guitar. Jon Wiederhorn of MTV wrote, [...] "Limp Bizkit jammed with four finalists after their much-publicized guitarist audition tour, but now it looks like Fred Durst might be taking a cue from his Puddle of Mudd pal Wes Scantlin and handling both vocal and guitar duties himself." ...|$|E
500|$|Martin Luther King, Jr. Day {{had become}} a big issue in McCain's home state, with Governor Evan Mecham making {{opposition}} to it his signature stance. [...] McCain had continued {{his opposition to the}} holiday by supporting Mecham's rescinding of the Arizona holiday for King in 1987. [...] In 1988, Mecham was impeached and removed from office due to felony charges. McCain told Mecham, [...] "You should never have been elected. You're an embarrassment to the party." [...] By 1989, McCain reiterated his opposition to the federal holiday, but reversed position on the state holiday, due to the economic boycotts and image problems Arizona was receiving as a result of it not having one. [...] He told Republicans opposing the state holiday, [...] "You will damn well do this. You will make this a holiday. You're making <b>us</b> <b>look</b> like fools." [...] In 1990, a state referendum on enacting the holiday was held; McCain persuaded Ronald Reagan to support it.|$|E

500|$|In 1929, at {{the second}} UAHC convention, Witt had {{asserted}} that America [...] "by its very pleasantness and friendliness lures us away from our ancient loyalties. Its secularism is so delightful, its mutuality so penetrative, its universalism so delightful, that by a sort of sheer spiritual osmosis it incorporates us into itself and makes <b>us</b> <b>look</b> and {{become more and more}} like itself". Witt argued that Jews had to resist this pull. Ten years later, however, in a 1939 article in The Christian Century, he argued that Jews should celebrate Christmas. In his view, Christians were now more liberal and celebrated [...] "the inherent humanness and universalism" [...] of Christmas, rather than any specifically Christian doctrine. Stating that his children had been deprived of the holiday's pleasures, Witt asserted that Judaism was already a syncretic religion, and that celebrating the holiday was an ecumenical act which did not indicate that he was [...] "thereby drawn even by the breadth of a hair nearer to the worship of an ecclesiastical Christ". He concluded by asking [...] "Is it neither treason of Jew nor triumph of Christian but partnership of Jew and Christian in the making of a better world in which the Christ can have part only by energizing and perpetuating and hallowing the partnership?" ...|$|E
500|$|Villa's form {{continued}} into the 2006–07 season, with the striker forming a partnership up front with former Real Madrid star Fernando Morientes. Between them, Villa and Morientes netted 43 goals in all competitions. That year also saw Villa debut in the UEFA Champions League; his first match was a qualifying match, coming on as a late substitute in a 1–0 first leg loss against Red Bull Salzburg. He went on to start the second leg and scored in a 3–0 win which saw Valencia qualify for the Champions League group stages. Crucial goals against Roma and Shakhtar Donetsk helped Valencia qualify for the knockout stages, where they faced Inter Milan. Villa scored a free-kick goal in the first leg away from home, while one of Inter's defenders complained that Villa had [...] "made <b>us</b> <b>look</b> like idiots, all on his own". Valencia went through to the quarter-finals, where they faced Chelsea. Villa featured in both games but {{failed to make the}} score sheet as Valencia were knocked out by the London team 3–2 on aggregate. In October 2006, he was included among the 50 nominees for the Ballon d'Or (often referred to as the European Footballer of the Year Award).|$|E
500|$|In January 2007, it was {{reported}} that May and England defender Glen Johnson were caught at a B store in Dartford, Kent, attempting to steal bathroom fittings. They both received £80 fines. Johnson described the incident as [...] "comical" [...] because it was a misunderstanding — [...] "Ben was doing up his bathroom so we went to B and found one of those sets where you get everything in one box. But he wanted a seat with a slow-close lid, so we took out the seat and put in another one. What we didn't know was that the new seat was £2.35 more expensive. We went through the till, paid for it and then the security guard stopped us and said he had been watching on CCTV. We just burst out laughing. Where's Jeremy Beadle then? But he said, 'No, this is serious, the police are on their way.' The police turned up and they were laughing. I said to the security guard, 'Can we not just pay the £2.35?'" [...] He said, 'No, this is a serious offence.' So the police gave us two options: go to court and fight it out, or pay an on-the-spot fine. We couldn't be bothered going to court so we paid the fine but doing that made <b>us</b> <b>look</b> guilty".|$|E

2500|$|In April 2008 in Brussels, Juncker {{suggested}} that the eurozone should be represented at the International Monetary Fund as a bloc, rather than each member state separately: [...] "It is absurd for those 15 countries not to agree to have a single representation at the IMF.

By the middle of the 2nd century, in Against Heresies Irenaeus had emphasized (...) that the Creator is the [...] "one and only God" [...] and the [...] "maker of heaven and earth".
