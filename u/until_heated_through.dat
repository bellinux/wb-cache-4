50|$|The modern brasero is an {{electric}} heater with a thermostat attached {{to guard against}} too much heat being generated. Most homes in Spain had a brasero <b>until</b> modern <b>heating</b> systems were installed in newly built homes over the last 15 years.

50|$|There {{are three}} kinds of heat transfer: {{conduction}} (exchange of <b>heat</b> <b>through</b> contact), convection (movement of fluids), and radiation.|$|R
