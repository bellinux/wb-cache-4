Crucian carp and SPMDs were deployed side by side for 32 d. The first-order <b>uptake</b> <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> of individual PAHs and OCPs for the, two matrices were calculated and compared to relate the amounts of chemicals accumulated by the matrices to dissolved water concentrations. On a wet-weight basis, total concentrations of PAHs and OCPs in crucian carp fillets averaged 49. 5 and 13. 6 ng/g, respectively, after the 32 -d exposure, whereas concentrations in whole SPMDs averaged 716. 9 and 62. 3 ng/g, respectively. The <b>uptake</b> <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> of PAHs and OCPs by SPMDs averaged seven- and fivefold higher, respectively, than those for crucian carp; however, the patterns of <b>uptake</b> <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> derived from test chemical concentrations in the crucian carp and SPMDs were similar. Although equilibrium was not reached for some PAHs and OCPs during the 32 -d exposure period, a reasonably good correlation between the concentration factors (CFs) and octanol/water partition coefficient (K-OW) values of PAHs and OCPs in SPMDs (r = 0. 86, p < 0. 001) was observed when potential sorption to dissolved organic carbon was taken into account. Similar efforts to correlate the CFs and K-OW values of PAHs and OCPs in crucian carp (r = 0. 75, p < 0. 001) were less successful, likely because of PAH metabolism by finfish.

In 2012, the dietary fish test {{has been added}} to the OECD TG 305 to provide a bioaccumulation test for substances that cannot be tested by aqueous exposure. For highly hydrophobic substances the dietary test is recommended, provided that the test is consistent with the relevant regulatory framework and risk assessment needs [4]. The dietary approach yields both a biomagnification factor (BMF) and an elimination rate constant for the chemical in focus. However, defined regulatory cut-off criteria for the biomagnification potential of chemical compounds are still missing and question the benefit of the BMF approach for the regulatory application. Being able to estimate a BCF from the data generated in the dietary study would meet the regulatory need and justify the use of animals.

An in vivo exposure examined the uptake and elimination kinetics for eight pharmaceutical compounds in the amphipod crustacean, Gammarus pulex by measuring their concentrations in both biological material {{and in the}} exposure medium over a 96 h period. Selected pharmaceuticals included two anti-inflammatories (diclofenac and ibuprofen), two beta-blockers (propranolol and metoprolol), an anti-depressant (imipramine), an anti-histamine (ranitidine) and two beta-agonists (formoterol and terbutaline). Kinetic bioconcentration factors (BCFs) for the selected pharmaceuticals were derived from a first-order one-compartment model using either the simultaneous or sequential modelling methods. Using the simultaneous method for parameter estimation, BCF values ranged from 12 to 212. In contrast, the sequential method for parameter estimation resulted in bioconcentration factors ranging from 19 to 4533.

40|$|To derive {{accumulation}} kinetics from different exposure matrices and {{account for the}} contribution of different exposure routes, the isopod Porcellio scaber was exposed to Cd and Zn, either in soil or in food, and a combination of both. Accurate uptake and elimination kinetics of Zn and Cd were determined using radioisotopes, allowing non-destructive time measurements. To describe the data, a simple kinetic model was used accounting for the internal distribution of the metals. A strong influence of the elimination kinetics, together with the metal fraction that is compartmentalized in a storage fraction, was found explaining the Cd steady-state level reached in the isopods. Zn turnover kinetics were relatively fast within {{the first days of}} exposure and elimination, followed by slow Zn kinetics from the storage compartment. The storage fraction appeared to be inert for elimination of both Zn and Cd within the experimental duration of 32 days and the fraction of metal taken up that was stored in this fraction was influenced by the uptake source. The quantity of metals taken up from soil or food depended on the concentration. For both Zn and Cd, the <b>uptake</b> <b>rate</b> <b>constant</b> from soil equalled the <b>uptake</b> <b>rate</b> <b>constant</b> from food, moreover, the uptake from both routes was shown to be additive. Therefore, it is concluded that the relative contribution of both routes (via soil or food) is explained by the partitioning of metals between soil and food. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Though studies on single metal uptake are thorough and complex, taking into account different uptake routes and species, they do {{not take into account}} the effect trace metals may have on each other. It is the aim of this study to add to this pool of knowledge. The focus of this investigation is zinc, cadmium and copper. To understand why these trace metals were chosen another important aspect is included: uptake channels which zinc and cadmium share but copper does not, leading to competitive and non-competitive uptake. This was investigated by designing and performing an uptake experiment on the species Gammarus pulex collected from a stream near Østrup. 24 hours mixed trace metal exposures were carried out to find the effect of cadmium and copper on zinc uptake. Tissue burdens were measured in the AAS facility at Roskilde University in order to obtain uptake rates. The results were analyzed using statistical software SPSS to perform an ANOVA, which showed there is no significant competition between any of the metals in mixture. While this was expected in mixtures containing copper, due to great variance in the data the result was similar for cadmium. However, when comparing the slopes of the regression lines, and therefore their uptake rate constants, it could indicate that zinc competes with cadmium. The <b>uptake</b> <b>rate</b> <b>constant</b> of zinc when in mixture with cadmium is zero, and therefore it can be seen that cadmium inhibits the accumulation of zinc. The <b>uptake</b> <b>rate</b> <b>constant</b> of zinc when in mixture with copper showed to be almost equal to that of zinc alone, suggesting no competition between the two metal ions. The mortality noted in the experiment is believed to be caused by the overestimation of the copper LC 50, but curiously, high concentrations of zinc seem to have an antagonistic effect on copper toxicity...|$|E
40|$|We {{measured}} the uptake kinetics of four metals (Cd, Cr, Se and Zn) in two marine macroalgae (the green alga Ulva lactuca {{and the red}} alga Gracilaria blodgettii). Metal uptake generally displayed a linear pattern with increasing exposure time. With the exception of Cr, which exhibited comparable <b>uptake</b> <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> at different concentrations, <b>uptake</b> <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> of Cd, Se and Zn decreased with increasing metal concentration, indicating that the seaweeds had a higher relative uptake at lower metal concentration. Uptake of Cd and Zn was higher in U. lactuca than in G, blodgettii, whereas uptake of Cr and Se was comparable between the two species. Only Cd and Zn uptake in U. lactuca was significantly inhibited by dark exposure. A decrease in salinity from 28 to 10 parts per thousand, enhanced the uptake of Cd, Cr, Se and Zn in U. lactuca 1. 9 -, 3. 0 -, 3. 6 -, and 1. 9 -fold, respectively. In G. blodgettii, Cd uptake increased twofold when salinity was decreased from 28 to 10 parts per thousand,, whereas uptake of Cr and Zn was not significantly affected by salinity change. The calculated depuration <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> of metals in U. lactuca were 0. 01 d(- 1) for Cd, 0. 05 to 0. 08 d(- 1) for Cr, 0. 14 to 0. 16 d(- 1) for Se, and 0. 12 to 0. 15 d(- 1) for Zn, and were relatively independent of the metal body burden in the algae. The predicted bioconcentration factor was 3 x 10 (4) for Cd, 2 x 10 (3) for Cr, 40 to 150 for Se, and 1 to 2 x 10 (4) for Zn in U. lactuca. Our kinetic study suggested that U. lactuca {{would be a good}} biomonitor of Cr and Zn contamination in coastal waters...|$|R
40|$|Zinc is an {{essential}} trace metal but also a potential toxicant to aquatic organisms. In this study, two juvenile marine fish species, the black sea bream Acanthopagrus schlegeli and the grunt Teraponiarbua, were pre-exposed to Zn either from waterborne (0. 74 - 170 mu gL(- 1)) or dietary (39 - 5926 mu g g(- 1)) Zn for 1 or 3 weeks. The concentrations of Zn and metallothionein (MT) in the whole body of the black sea bream and in the gills, viscera and carcass of the grunt were then measured during this pre-exposure. Following the pre-exposure, both fish species were then exposed to Cd- 109 and 65 Zn labeled food or water to quantify the dietary assimilation efficiency (AE) and the <b>uptake</b> <b>rate</b> of dissolved Cd and Zn. Zn concentrations in both fish species were enhanced after pre-exposure, but the increases were {{much less than the}} increase of ambient Zn pre-exposure concentration. Following Zn pre-exposure, MT concentrations in the viscera and carcass were significantly elevated, whereas the MT levels were not significantly elevated in the gills. Waterbome and dietary Zn exposure enhanced the <b>uptake</b> <b>rates</b> of dissolved Cd and Zn in both fish. The maximum increases of <b>uptake</b> <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> of dissolved Cd and Zn were up to 1. 9 - 2. 8 and 2. 1 - 2. 6 times, respectively, in the seabream and grunt. In contrast, dietary assimilation efficiency of Cd and Zn was not significantly enhanced following Zn pre-exposure. A positive linear relationship was found between the <b>uptake</b> <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> of dissolved metals and Zn or MT concentrations in the fish. The results suggested that Zn pre-exposure increased the potential of metal uptake from ambient water, but had little effect on dietary metal uptake. Furthermore, the Zn body concentration and metal uptake from the dissolved phase were significantly dependent on the fish body size. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Movement disorders, {{including}} Parkinsonism, {{are prominent}} features of neurological Wilson's disease (WD). This suggests {{there may be}} dysfunction of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway. To explore this possibility, five patients were studied using positron emission tomography (PET) with 18 F- 6 -fluorodopa (6 FD), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We calculated striatal 6 FD <b>uptake</b> <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> by a graphical method and compared the results with those of 18 normal subjects. It was found that four patients with symptoms all had abnormally low 6 FD uptake, and the one asymptomatic patient had normal uptake. PET evidence for nigrostriatal dopaminergic dysfunction was present even {{after many years of}} penicillamine treatment. It is concluded that the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway is involved in neurological WD...|$|R
