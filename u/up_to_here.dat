Davies went into a state of depression, culminating in his onstage announcement that he was [...] "sick of it all" [...] at a gig in White City Stadium. A review of the concert published in Melody Maker stated: [...] "Davies swore on stage. He stood at The White City and swore that he was 'F...... sick of the whole thing'... He was 'Sick <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>here</b> with it'... and those that heard shook their heads. Mick just ventured a disbelieving smile, and drummer on through 'Waterloo Sunset. Davies proceeded to try to announce that the Kinks were breaking up, but this attempt was foiled by the group's publicity management, who pulled the plug on the microphone system.|$|E

A British patrol boat killed one torpedo's crew (Lt. Visintini and Petty Officer Magro) with a depth charge. Their bodies were recovered, and their swimfins were taken and used by two of Gibraltar's British guard divers (who dived with Davis Escape Sets and (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>here)</b> breaststroke swimming and no fins) (Sydney Knowles and Commander Lionel Crabb). Another British patrol boat spotted another torpedo, and chased and shot at it and captured its two crewmen. The remaining torpedo returned to the Olterra without its rear rider.|$|E

He was, and is, a much better actor than just playing James Bond, but he became synonymous with Bond. He'd be {{walking down the street}} and people would say, [...] "Look, there's James Bond."

"Sitting in the Midday Sun" [...] was {{released}} {{during a period}} of turmoil for The Kinks—bandleader Ray Davies' marital problems with his wife Rasa came to a head nine days before the song's UK release when she left him, taking their children with her. Ray went into a state of depression; Doug Hinman wrote about his condition: [...] "a week following his wife's departure, an emotionally distraught Ray [...] admitted to hospital for suspected barbiturate poisoning. He [...] treated and released." [...] Shortly after the incident, on 15 July, The Kinks made an infamous appearance at the White City Stadium.
