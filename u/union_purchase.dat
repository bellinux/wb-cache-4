30|$|On {{the other}} hand, taxi drivers should receive {{education}} {{about the dangers}} of risky driving behaviors to encourage them to obey the traffic rules and avoid serious traffic violations [23], such as speeding and disregarding red lights, etc. Those who disobey the rules should be harshly penalized or have their taxi license revoked.

It would also be worthwhile to open a complaint centre through which passengers and drivers could submit grievances and resolve disputes about service problems; a coordinated problem resolution procedure may help to reduce taxi drivers’ risky driving behaviors.|$|E
