The {{objective of this}} numerical study is to understand the propagation phenomena of ultrasonic waves in prototypes cylindrically shaped implants and to investigate the sensitivity of their <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>response</b> to the surrounding bone biomechanical properties. The 10 MHz <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>response</b> of the implant was calculated using a finite difference numerical simulation tool and was compared to rf signals taken from a recent experimental study by Mathieu et al.

The sensitivity of the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>response</b> of the implant to changes of (i) amount of bone in contact with the implant, (ii) cortical bone thickness, and (iii) surrounding bone material properties, was compared to the reproducibility of the measurements. The results show that, either a change of 1 mm of bone in contact with the implant, or 1. 1 mm of cortical thickness or 12 % of trabecular bone mass density should be detectable. This study paves the way for the investigation of the use of quantitative ultrasound techniques for the evaluation of bone-implant interface properties and implant stability.

40|$|The {{importance}} of NDT qualification has received significant attention {{during the recent}} years. Recent findings of cracks in Inconel 600 in different NPP components have also increased interest in the reliability of in-service inspections of this material. This, in turn, sets challenge for manufacturing of representative qualification specimens and flaws. A new, advanced flaw production technique has become available. The technique enables production of realistic cracks to ready-made mock-ups without implanting or welding. This paper describes the advanced crack production technique and its application to Inconel 600. A realistic, controlled crack was produced to a core spray nozzle safe-end mock-up. The technique produces true fatigue cracks, which are representative of most real, service-induced cracks. The technique is applicable to any shape or size of component and results only in an intended crack without unwanted disturbances. The technique allows production of a single or separate cracks as well as different combinations of them. In addition to the controlled crack production, the paper introduces studies {{of the effects of}} different thermal fatigue loading cycles on the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>response</b> obtained from the crack in Inconel 600.

40|$|Abstract: The theory already {{available}} for the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>response</b> to a quantum two-level system for amorphous materials is discussed and adapted to two and four level systems in crystals. It is given in a simple physical way which helps make clear the distinction between resonance and relaxation. Resonance and no relaxation occurs for small enough static strain, while for large enough strain, the opposite is true. For a TLS, relaxation occurs by a direct process, with a rate linear in temperature in the measurable range. This leads to a Debye response, but the temperature dependence is inverted from that usually found for faster relaxation rates. At low enough tempera-tures the relaxation strength deviates from the classical 1 /T behavior, going to zero as the upper state becomes depopulated, while the resonance strength saturates. At high temperatures, the sum of these approaches the classical value. Relaxation and resonance strengths are given for two and four level systems {{as a function of}} tempera-ture and strain for two strain distributions.

The effect is essentially the same: the time-reversed signals focus and create a virtual source which radiates waves into the medium that are subsequently recorded by receivers.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Fibre-metal {{laminates}} such as GLARE (alternating glass-fibre composite and aluminium layers) are seeing increasing usage on critical aircraft structures {{due to their}} enhanced fatigue resistance compared with unreinforced metal. They can be inspected for overall quality using through-transmission ultrasound, {{but it is very}} difficult to determine the depth or nature of any defect in the structure in order to assess its importance or severity. As a result, manufacturing scrap rates are higher than desirable and designed components are heavier in order to mitigate risk due to inadequate information. Defect-depth information is buried in the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>response</b> but is difficult to extract due to the high reflection coefficients of the interfaces and the variable glass-fibre layer thicknesses. This paper presents the potential for using model-based multi-dimensional optimisation to determine the layer thicknesses and depth locations of anomalies in the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>response</b> due to delaminations or porosity. Numerical (FEM) and analytical methods are presented to model the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>response</b> of fibre-metal laminates, calculated as the steady-state harmonic response of the layered medium. These frequency-domain responses can be used to determine the individual layer thicknesses and depth locations of anomalies by multi-dimensional optimisation. Investigations on the accuracy and the limitations of the method for the 3 D characterisation of laminates will be presented. In addition, the evaluated frequency-domain responses show that the high reflection coefficients in combination with the periodic arrangement of the layup effectively mimic the behaviour of a one-dimensional phononic crystal. In the through-transmission ultrasound response, stop bands arise where the transmission is close to zero. None of the resonance frequencies of a laminate - even one with a finite number of layers - can lie within a stop band. However, the presence of a defect in a layer, or different material properties or thickness, can cause the defect modes, i. e. eigenmodes, to shift into the expected stop bands. This might open new possibilities in the nondestructive testing of fibre-metal laminates, which will be elaborated in the presented paper...|$|E
