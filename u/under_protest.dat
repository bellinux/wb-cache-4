5|$|Approximately 32,400 coins {{on which}} Morgan {{had tried to}} keep a higher relief were struck in January 1922. While all were {{believed}} to have been melted, one circulated example has surfaced. Also, high relief 1922 proof dollars occasionally appear on the market and it is believed that about six to 10 of them exist. The new low-relief coins, which Fraser accepted on behalf of the Commission, though <b>under</b> <b>protest,</b> were given limited production runs in Philadelphia in early February. When the results proved satisfactory, San Francisco began striking its first Peace dollars using the low-relief design on February 13, with Denver initiating production on February 21, and Philadelphia on February 23. The three mints together struck over 84million pieces in 1922.|$|E
5|$|The {{frontiers of}} the Principality of Albania {{had not been}} set during the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, as they were left for the League to decide; they {{had not yet been}} {{determined}} by September 1921, creating an unstable situation. Greek troops conducted military operations in the south of Albania. Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (Yugoslav) forces became engaged, after clashes with Albanian tribesmen, {{in the northern part of}} the country. The League sent a commission of representatives from various powers to the region. In November 1921, the League decided that the frontiers of Albania should be the same as they had been in 1913, with three minor changes that favoured Yugoslavia. Yugoslav forces withdrew a few weeks later, albeit <b>under</b> <b>protest.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1904 {{season the}} New Zealand Rugby Football Union (NZRFU) {{suspended}} Gallaher from playing after a disagreement over a claim for expenses he had submitted to the Auckland Rugby Football Union for travel to play in the match against the British Isles. Eventually the matter was resolved when, <b>under</b> <b>protest,</b> Gallaher repaid the disputed amount. This settlement, coupled with his performance in 26–0 North Island win over the South Island in the pre-tour trial, allowed Gallaher to be considered for selection for New Zealand's 1905–06 tour of Europe and North America. The NZRFU had been trying to secure an invitation to send a team to Britain for some time, and were finally able to secure satisfactory financial guarantees to proceed in 1905. This was the first representative New Zealand team to undertake such a tour, though a privately organised team, the New Zealand Natives, had preceded them in 1888–89.|$|E

After only six years service, <b>under</b> <b>protests</b> that he illegally arrested Baca by entering Mexico and under pressure from Texas Governor Oran M.

Shortly thereafter, Bolivia began negotiations with an Anglo-American trust, the Bolivian Syndicate, in order to promote, with exceptional force (exacting of taxes, armed force), {{the political and economic}} incorporation of Acre into its territory. The governor of Amazonas, Ramalho Júnior, informed of the agreement by a functionary of the Bolivian consulate in Belém, Luis Gálvez Rodríguez de Arias, sent military contingents forward to occupy Puerto Alonso. Gálvez proclaimed the independence of Acre, {{in the form of a}} republic, becoming its president with the acquiescence of the rubber gatherers. <b>Under</b> <b>protests</b> from Bolivia, President Campos Sales abolished the ephemeral republic (March 1900).|$|R

25|$|A similar {{unprecedented}} re-run {{occurred in}} the women's 4 × 100 metres relay heats: Brazil's second leg runner Franciela Krasucki accidentally obstructed American Allyson Felix during the baton exchange, causing Felix to drop the baton. The American team picked up the baton and finished <b>under</b> <b>protest.</b> Following their appeal, the team were given their own special third heat, running alone to try to achieve {{one of the fastest}} non-qualifying spots.

The MLP had now fully abandoned support for integration (when Mintoff's demands for financial guarantees were not accepted) and now advocated full independence from the British Crown.

50|$|Child {{marriage}} was outlawed in 1929, under Indian law. However, in the British colonial times, the legal minimum age of {{marriage was}} set at 15 for girls and 18 for boys. <b>Under</b> <b>protests</b> from Muslim organizations in the undivided British India, a personal law Shariat Act was passed in 1937 that allowed child marriages with consent from girl's guardian. After independence and adoption of Indian constitution in 1950, the child marriage act has undergone several revisions. The minimum legal age for marriage, since 1978, has been 18 for women and 21 for men. The child marriage prevention laws have been challenged in Indian courts, with some Muslim Indian organizations seeking no minimum age and that the age matter be left to their personal law.
