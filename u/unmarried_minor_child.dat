50|$|The {{abolition}} of the National Origins quota system came with the Hart-Celler Act of 1965. This legislation placed a heavy emphasis on family reunification, designating 74% of visas for that purpose. There was no limit on spouses, <b>unmarried</b> <b>minor</b> <b>children,</b> and parents of U.S. citizens. The percentages for family reunification were as follows: Unmarried adult children of U.S. citizens (20%), spouses and unmarried children of permanent residents aliens (20%), married children of U.S. citizens (10%), brothers and sisters of U.S. citizens over age 21 (24%). These new visa preferences created a swell of new chain migration and immigration in general. The Third World began to outpace European immigration to America {{for the first time}} in history, surpassing it by the end of the 1960s and doubling the numbers of European migration by the end of the 1970s.|$|R
25|$|The United States {{immigration}} {{system provides}} channels for legal, permanent economic immigration, especially for high-skilled workers. For low-skilled workers, temporary or seasonal legal immigration {{is easier to}} acquire. The United States immigration system rests on three pillars: family reunification, provision of scarce labor (as in agricultural and specific high-skilled worker sectors), and protecting American workers from competition with foreign workers. The current system sets an overall limit of 675,000 permanent immigrants each year; this limit {{does not apply to}} spouses, <b>unmarried</b> <b>minor</b> <b>children</b> or parents of U.S. citizens. Outside of this number for permanent immigrants, 480,000 visas are allotted for those under the family-preference rules and 140,000 are allocated for employment-related preferences. The current system and low number of visas available make it difficult for low-skilled workers to legally and permanently enter the country to work, so illegal entry becomes the way immigrants respond to the lure of jobs with higher wages than what {{they would be able to}} find in their current country.|$|R
5000|$|Furthermore, {{spouses and}} <b>minor</b> <b>unmarried</b> <b>children</b> of those professors {{who were still}} named state {{officials}} previously also received Austrian citizenship (§ 25 Abs. 2 and 3) by declaring, within one year of the spouse's/parent's acceptance as a citizen, [...] "a {{desire to be a}} loyal citizen of the Republic". In this special case of naturalization, dual citizenship was permitted. A parliamentary survey 9 on the number of people naturalized in this fashion showed that there had been no statistics collected on this point.|$|R
50|$|María Lugarda de Jesús Alvarado (born 1842) married Francisco Palomares (born 1840) of Rancho San Jose in 1866 in Los Angeles. She {{received}} the western third of Rancho Monserate, which {{is closest to}} Fallbrook. Rather than relocating, she leased the land to R. Turnbull. In 1885 Lugarda Alvarado de Palomares authorized her son-in-law Henry Avila, husband of her daughter Concepcion, to collect rents and profits from the Palomares Ranch {{so that he could}} establish a trust for her <b>unmarried</b> daughter and <b>minor</b> <b>children.</b> After a few years, Avila built a house on the northern boundary of the Palomares Ranch, next to Stage Coach Lane.|$|R
