During the next five days, all 607th units remained in place and conducted maintenance. On 14 March, the Division was ordered to march to a position facing Koblenz. The next mission was to take this town. During the night of 16 March, Co. A supported the 347th Infantry Regiment's crossing of the Moselle River and subsequent advance southeast toward the Rhine River. On 18 March, Co. C crossed the Moselle and accompanied the 345th Infantry Regiment into Koblenz. Later that day they fired at Fort Konstantin. Within {{the next two days}} Koblenz was captured. Direct fire caused 14 officers and 85 men to surrender the fort, one of the last positions taken.|$|E
2500|$|Sharks are {{equipped}} with sensory organs called the Ampullae of Lorenzini that detect the electricity generated by muscle movement. The shark's electrical receptors, which pick <b>up</b> <b>movement,</b> detect signals like those emitted from fish wounded, for example, by someone who is spearfishing, leading the shark to attack the person by mistake. George H. Burgess, director of the International Shark Attack File, said the following regarding why people are attacked: [...] "Attacks are basically an odds game based on how many hours {{you are in the}} water".|$|E
2500|$|The {{expedition}} progressed slowly because Braddock considered {{making a}} road to Fort Duquesne {{a priority in}} order to effectively supply the position he expected to capture and hold at the Forks of the Ohio, and because of a shortage of healthy draft animals. [...] In some cases, the column was only able to progress {{at a rate of}} two miles (about 3km) a day, creating Braddock's Roadan important legacy of the marchas they went. To speed <b>up</b> <b>movement,</b> Braddock split his men into a [...] "flying column" [...] of about 1,300 men which he commanded, and, lagging far behind, a supply column of 800 men with most of the baggage, commanded by Colonel Thomas Dunbar. They passed the ruins of Fort Necessity along the way, where the French and Canadians had defeated Washington the previous summer. Small French and Indian war bands skirmished with Braddock's men during the march.|$|E

In addition, 18 men from Echo Company's Reconnaissance Platoon were at the base preparing for an operation the following day. These troops shared space with 34 support personnel (medics, radiomen, etc.) from 1-46th's Headquarters Company (HHC). The rest of the garrison (less the ARVN artillerymen) came from elements of Alpha, Bravo, and Delta companies, 1-46th (22 men who were in transit between their units and areas further to the rear), and assorted artillery personnel (including the crew of a quad-.50 caliber machine gun from Battery G, 55th Field Artillery). According to one source all ground surveillance radars and night vision (starlite) scopes formerly at Mary Ann were [...] "sent to the Battalion rear for maintenance." [...] This left the base with a series of ground sensors designed to detect movement located [...] "within fifteen hundred to forty-eight hundred meters" [...] of the perimeter.

25|$|Martin Richards et al. {{found that}} 15–40% of extant mtDNA {{lineages}} trace {{back to the}} Palaeolithic migrations (depending on whether one allows for multiple founder events).

Middle <b>U.P.</b> <b>movements</b> are marked by the haplogroups HV, I and U4.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to test how much aging changes affect the human motor system with respect to {{relative}} leg strength. 15 elderly (7 females, 8 males, av. age 67. 1 years) and 28 young (13 females, 15 males, av. age 22. 5 years) persons participated in the study. The measurement station consisted of a step-box and four tactile leg sensors. Two of them were placed on a platform on the floor and the other two on a 30. 5 cm (12 inches) high step-box. Subjects walked up and down irregularly and as quickly as possible on the step-box with the right and the left leg in response to two lights. The leg strength was measured in a series of 20 movements indirectly by the time of straightening the leg put on the step-box. We have found that the speed of stepping <b>up</b> <b>movements</b> (explosive and dynamic strength of leg straightness) was higher in the young than elderly subjects for the left and right leg by 21. 3 % and 21. 8 % respectively. Elderly female subjects walked up slower than elderly male subjects only with the left leg by 10. 3 % and by 24. 7 % more slowly than young female subjects. Elderly men were slower than young ones by 18. 6 %. No statistically significant differences were found in the speed of stepping <b>up</b> <b>movements</b> between young female and male subjects for both legs...|$|R
