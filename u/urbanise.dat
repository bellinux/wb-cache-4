The middle schools rapidly attained great popularity, and over the next half-century, large numbers of children and young people used them as a stepping stone to upper secondary education.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{recognised}} conservation {{value of}} phylogenetic diversity, {{little is known}} about how it is affected by the urbanisation process. Combining a complete avian phylogeny with surveys along urbanisation gradients from five continents, we show that highly <b>urbanised</b> environments supported on average 450 million fewer years of evolutionary history than the surrounding natural environments. This loss was primarily caused by species loss and could have been higher had not been partially compensated by the addition of urban exploiters and some exotic species. Highly <b>urbanised</b> environments also supported fewer evolutionary distinctive species, implying a disproportionate loss of evolutionary history. Compared with highly <b>urbanised</b> environments, changes in phylogenetic richness and evolutionary distinctiveness were less substantial in moderately <b>urbanised</b> environments. Protecting pristine environments is therefore essential for maintaining phylogenetic diversity, but moderate levels of urbanisation still preserve much of the original diversity...|$|R

50|$|That {{other tribes}} did {{not engage in}} {{commercial}} trade, or <b>urbanise</b> their societies, or mint coinage, is probably a combination of circumstance and choice. Their territories were more mountainous and less amenable to urbanisation, and their resources were not suitable for large-scale organised commercial trade, so these options were not available to them. However, the Dumnonii in Cornwall and Devon had substantial deposits of tin, and the Demetae in southwestern Wales were extracting gold at Dolaucothi, and both likely could have developed a commercially oriented society had {{they wanted to do}} so.|$|E

50|$|Having been an {{agricultural}} village since the Late Middle Ages, the Kentish town of Sidcup began to <b>urbanise</b> following {{the opening of}} Sidcup railway station on the South Eastern Railway's new Dartford Loop Line in 1866. The new transport links to central London led to increasing numbers of middle class professionals moving to the town, in particular from inner London suburbs such as Camberwell and New Cross, which were experiencing social unrest and a rise in slum housing. After the rail line's electrification following {{the culmination of the}} First World War, speculative builders bought up cheap farmland around the town and by 1930 its population had risen to just short of 12,000, and would treble within the next two decades.|$|E
50|$|When South Africa's mines were {{developed}} and Black South Africans began to <b>urbanise,</b> women {{moved to the}} city also, and began to brew beer for the predominantly male labour force - a labour force that was mostly either single or who had left their wives back {{in the rural areas}} under the migrant labour system. That tradition of urban women making beer for the labour force persists in South Africa to the extent that informal bars and taverns (shebeens) are typically owned by women (shebeen queens). Today, most urban dwellers buy beer manufactured by industrial breweries that make beer that is like beer one would buy in Europe and America, but rural people and recent immigrants to the city still enjoy the cloudy, unfiltered traditional beer.|$|E

50|$|Inner Mongolia {{has seen}} {{considerable}} development since Deng Xiaoping instituted Chinese economic reform in 1978. For {{about ten years}} since 2000, Inner Mongolia's GDP growth has been {{the highest in the}} country, (along with Guangdong) largely owing to the success of natural resource industries in the region. GDP growth has continually been over 10%, even 15% and connections with the Wolf Economy to the north has helped development. However, growth has come at a cost with huge amounts of pollution and degradation to the grasslands. Attempts to attract ethnic Chinese to migrate from other regions, as well as <b>urbanise</b> those rural nomads and peasants has led to huge amounts of corruption and waste in public spending, such as Ordos City. Acute uneven wealth distribution has further exacerbated ethnic tensions, many indigenous Mongolians feeling they are increasingly marginalised in their own homeland, leading to riots in 2011 and 2013.|$|E
5000|$|As the Township of Etobicoke {{was first}} settled by British {{military}} families {{there were few}} Catholics in the municipality and the area was technically in the early Catholic Parish of St Patrick's, Dixie (near Toronto's present day airport) although early Catholic residents of southern Etobicoke found the early parish of St Helen's in Toronto's western suburb of Brockton more convenient. The Diocese of Toronto established, at different times in the late 19th century, two mission churches of St Patrick's, Dixie, in Etobicoke; St Joseph's and St Rita's. Both these early missions were on Dundas Street West in the centre of Etobicoke, an area now {{within the boundaries of}} Our Lady of Sorrows Parish. [...] In the early 20th century, southern Etobicoke began to rapidly <b>urbanise</b> and new municipalities were formed out of Etobicoke which left the rest of the township a rural municipality centred on the Islington postal village at Dundas and Bloor. The first permanent Catholic parishes were founded in the independent Lakeshore municipalities of Mimico (St Leo's) and New Toronto (St Teresa's).|$|E
40|$|Background Quenda (Isoodon obesulus) and brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) {{remain in}} many areas of Perth, Western Australia, despite urbanisation. This thesis {{investigated}} the impacts of urbanisation on the parasitic infections, morphometrics and reproductive fitness of these marsupials. Parasite screening particularly investigated the presence of parasites that quenda and possums may be acquiring from humans and pets in <b>urbanised</b> environments. Methods This cross sectional study targeted free-ranging quenda and brushtail possums in Perth. Trapping was undertaken on 29 bushland sites and 35 <b>urbanised</b> sites. Trapped marsupials were sampled for gastrointestinal and macroscopic ecto- parasites and Toxoplasma gondii antibodies, and morphometrics were measured. Statistical analyses included linear and logistic regression, Kulldorff’s spatial scan statistic and analysis of similarities in parasite communities. Results 287 quenda and 33 brushtail possums were sampled across 55 sites. Parasitic infections were common in Perth quenda, and less so in brushtail possums. Twelve parasite taxa were identified infecting these host species for the first time. In quenda, some differences in parasite prevalences, odds of infection, intensities of infection, and parasite communities, were observed in quenda trapped in <b>urbanised</b> environments compared to bushland. In quenda, Giardia spp. infection was common, and typically the non-zoonotic G. peramelis. Analyses suggest that the primary influence on the distribution of Giardia spp. infection in quenda is population density. Quenda trapped in <b>urbanised</b> environments were heavier on average than quenda trapped in bushland, in the absence of convincing evidence of a difference in skeletal morphometrics. Bushland adult female quenda had increased odds of having an active pouch than those in <b>urbanised</b> environments. Conclusions Quenda and brushtail possums in Perth are not commonly infected with gastrointestinal and macroscopic ecto- parasites of humans and domestic animal origin. Quenda in <b>urbanised</b> environments have a tendency towards obesity. <b>Urbanised</b> environments may negatively impact fecundity of female quenda...|$|R

50|$|In 1900, Holy Family Church {{was created}} in the Parkdale neighbourhood, out of Toronto's {{original}} west end parish of St. Helen's, Brockton at a time when development was already spreading north from Parkdale to the new 'Howard Park' residential district. By 1914, {{at the end of the}} first large wave of non British immigration to Toronto, many Catholics had arrived in the city and the population was considered sufficient for a second parish near Parkdale on Roncesvalles Ave which was developing as a commercial heart of the Howard Park neighbourhood. St. Vincent de Paul Church and School opened in the centre of the Howard Park neighbourhood as the First World War began and immigration to the area came to a halt. After the world wars, many Catholic Polish families arrived in the area and a decision was taken to create a separate Polish Church (St. Casimir's) for them on Roncesvalles Ave. out of St. Vincent de Paul Parish. As the area to the north continued to <b>urbanise,</b> especially after the construction of a subway along Bloor Street in the 1960s, a second parish was created out of St. Vincent de Paul's on that street: St. Joan of Arc. Meanwhile, many older families had left the area and St. Vincent de Paul church began to fall into serious decline as the congregation dwindled.|$|E
50|$|In 1952, Etobicoke left York County {{with the}} other {{municipalities}} south of Steeles Ave to join the new Metropolitan Toronto which began to <b>urbanise</b> the townships around Toronto like Etobicoke. In 1946 the 'Queensway' post office opened and at the Queensway and Royal York a development of 'veterans houses' was built for returning servicemen. In the 1950s, Toronto was expanding and Queen Street West was extended from the foot of Roncesvalles Avenue {{around the top of}} Humber Bay north of the Railway tracks complementing the Lake Shore to the south and linking with the former Stock's Side Road. With the accession of Queen Elizabeth in 1952 this street was named The Queensway also to be consistent with Queen Street to the west and the Kingsway to the north. Many immigrants arrived in the post-war years and the large northern parts of this neighbourhood was largely developed between Islington and the Mimico Creek where many new streets were laid out. North of The Queensway many apartments were built east of Stephen Drive. With the development of residential to the North the old heart of the community south of the Queensway between the Humber River and the Mimico Creek became industrial {{with the arrival of the}} Ontario Food Terminal north of the QEW and Christie's Factory to the south. North of the Queensway the Golf Course became a Sewage Treatment Plant. The Palace Pier was lost to a fire set by arsonists. In 1954 Hurricane Hazel devastated the Humber Valley and Humber Bay was one of the worst hit areas, however because of the loss of so much of the residential area around the old Lake Shore/Queensway intersection, the damage was largely to city infrastructure notably destroying the Lake Shore and Royal York bridges over the Mimico Creek and damaging the Lake Shore Bridge over the Humber.|$|E
