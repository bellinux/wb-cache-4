5|$|In {{ferromagnetic}} {{elements such}} as iron, cobalt and nickel, an odd number of electrons leads to an <b>unpaired</b> electron and a net overall magnetic moment. The orbitals of neighboring atoms overlap and a lower energy state is achieved when the spins of <b>unpaired</b> electrons are aligned with each other, a spontaneous process known as an exchange interaction. When the magnetic moments of ferromagnetic atoms are lined up, the material can produce a measurable macroscopic field. Paramagnetic materials have atoms with magnetic moments that line up in random directions when no magnetic field is present, but the magnetic moments of the individual atoms line up {{in the presence of}} a field.|$|E

5|$|The {{vertebral}} column in bowfin is ossified and {{in comparison to}} earlier fishes, the centra are the major support for the body, whereas in earlier fish the notochord was the main form of support. Neural spines and ribs provide additional support and help stabilize <b>unpaired</b> fins. In bowfin neural spines and ribs also increase in prominence, an evolutionary aspect that helps them stabilize <b>unpaired</b> fins. The evolution of the {{vertebral column}} allows the bowfin to withstand lateral bending that puts the column under compression without breaking.

The bowfin has a homocercal tail, {{which means that the}} tail has equal lobes that appear symmetrical.This type of tail gives the body a streamlined shape which allows the bowfin to improve its swimming ability by reducing drag. These types of tails are common in fish with gas bladders, because the bladder supplies the fish with natural buoyancy.|$|E

40|$|The {{purposes}} of the current investigation were to a) pair a neutral stimulus with aversive demands {{to determine if the}} stimulus could be conditioned to evoke communication responses as a conditioned reflexive establishing operations (CEO-R) and b) systematically determine the relative effects of two <b>unpairing</b> procedures on the communication evoked by the CEO. Task demands were shown to be establishing operations, evoking problem behavior to access escape, for 4 students with disabilities. Alternative communication responses were taught as an appropriate method to request escape. This treatment combined with extinction for problem behavior led to decreases in problem behavior for all students. A stimulus was then paired with the task demand during the motivating operations analysis to create a reflexive conditioned establishing operation (CEO-R) that evoked communication responses. Once data suggested that the stimulus was functioning as a CEO-R, two methods were evaluated to reduce the value of the stimulus. Results indicated that noncontingent reinforcement <b>unpairing</b> was an effective method to reduce the evocative effects of the stimulus.

40|$|Extensive {{evidence}} indicates that the septum plays a predominant role in fear learning, yet the direction of this control is still a matter of debate. Increasing {{data suggest that the}} medial (MS) and lateral septum (LS) would be differentially required in fear conditioning depending on whether a discrete conditional stimulus (CS) predicts, or not, the occurrence of an aversive unconditional stimulus (US). Here, using a tone CS-US pairing (predictive discrete CS, context in background) or <b>unpairing</b> (context in foreground) conditioning procedure, we show, in mice, that pretraining inactivation of the LS totally disrupted tone fear conditioning, which, otherwise, was spared by inactivation of the MS. Inactivating the LS also reduced foreground contextual fear conditioning, while sparing the higher level of conditioned freezing to the foreground (CS-US <b>unpairing)</b> than to the background context (CS-US pairing). In contrast, inactivation of the MS totally abolished this training-dependent level of contextual freezing. Interestingly, inactivation of the MS enhanced background contextual conditioning under the pairing condition, whereas it reduced foreground contextual conditioning under the <b>unpairing</b> condition. Hence, the present findings reveal a functional dissociation between the LS and the MS in Pavlovian fear conditioning depending on the predictive value of the discrete CS. While the requirement of the LS is crucial for the appropriate processing of the tone CS-US association, the MS is crucial for an appropriate processing of contextual cues as foreground or background information...|$|R

5|$|A {{nitrogen}} atom {{has seven}} electrons. In the ground state, they {{are arranged in}} the electron configuration 1s2s2p2p2p. It therefore has five valence electrons in the 2s and 2p orbitals, three of which (the p-electrons) are <b>unpaired.</b> It {{has one of the}} highest electronegativities among the elements (3.04 on the Pauling scale), exceeded only by chlorine (3.16), oxygen (3.44), and fluorine (3.98).

The nitride anion, N3−, is much larger at 146pm, similar to that of the oxide (O2−: 140pm) and fluoride (F−: 133pm) anions. The first three ionisation energies of nitrogen are 1.402, 2.856, and 4.577MJ·mol−1, and the sum of the fourth and fifth is 16.920MJ·mol−1.

5|$|Distinguishing {{features}} of the teleosts are mobile premaxilla, elongated neural arches {{at the end of}} the caudal fin and <b>unpaired</b> basibranchial toothplates. The premaxilla is unattached to the neurocranium (braincase); it plays a role in protruding the mouth and creating a circular opening. This lowers the pressure inside the mouth, sucking the prey inside. The lower jaw and maxilla are then pulled back to close the mouth, and the fish is able to grasp the prey. By contrast, mere closure of the jaws would risk pushing food out of the mouth. In more advanced teleosts, the premaxilla is enlarged and has teeth, while the maxilla is toothless. The maxilla functions to push both the premaxilla and the lower jaw forward. To open the mouth, an adductor muscle pulls back the top of the maxilla, pushing the lower jaw forward. In addition, the maxilla rotates slightly, which pushes forward a bony process that interlocks with the premaxilla.|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} in the {{presence}} of magnetic field, two superconducting phases with the center-of-mass momentum of Cooper pair parallel to the magnetic field are induced in spin-orbit-coupled superconductor Li$_ 2 $Pd$_ 3 $B. Specifically, at small magnetic field, the center-of-mass momentum is induced due to the energy-spectrum distortion and no <b>unpairing</b> region with vanishing singlet correlation appears. We refer to this superconducting state as the drift-BCS state. By further increasing the magnetic field, the superconducting state falls into the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state with the emergence of the <b>unpairing</b> regions. The observed abrupt enhancement of the center-of-mass momenta and suppression on the order parameters during the crossover indicate the first-order phase transition. Enhanced Pauli limit and hence enlarged magnetic-field regime of the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state, due to the spin-flip terms of the spin-orbit coupling, are revealed. We also address the triplet correlations induced by the spin-orbit coupling, and show that the Cooper-pair spin polarizations, generated by the magnetic field and center-of-mass momentum with the triplet correlations, exhibit totally different magnetic-field dependences between the drift-BCS and Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov states.

5|$|However, {{the most}} {{important}} oxidation state for silver in complexes is +1. The Ag+ cation is diamagnetic, like its homologues Cu+ and Au+, as all three have closed-shell electron configurations with no <b>unpaired</b> electrons: its complexes are colourless provided the ligands are not too easily polarized such as I−. Ag+ forms salts with most anions, but it is reluctant to coordinate to oxygen and thus most of these salts are insoluble in water: the exceptions are the nitrate, perchlorate, and fluoride. The tetracoordinate tetrahedral aqueous ion + is known, but the characteristic geometry for the Ag+ cation is 2-coordinate linear. For example, silver chloride dissolves readily in excess aqueous ammonia to form +; silver salts are dissolved in photography due {{to the formation of}} the thiosulfate complex 3−; and cyanide extraction for silver (and gold) works by the formation of the complex −. Silver cyanide forms the linear polymer {Ag–C≡N→Ag–C≡N→}; silver thiocyanate has a similar structure, but forms a zigzag instead because of the sp3-hybridized sulfur atom. Chelating ligands are unable to form linear complexes and thus silver(I) complexes with them tend to form polymers; a few exceptions exist, such as the near-tetrahedral diphosphine and diarsine complexes +.|$|E
5|$|In {{his book}} King Solomon's Ring, Konrad Lorenz {{described}} and analysed the complex social interactions {{in a western}} jackdaw flock that lived around his house in Altenberg, Austria. He ringed them for identification and caged them in the winter to prevent their annual migration. He found that the birds have a linear hierarchical group structure, with higher-ranked individuals dominating lower-ranked birds, and pair-bonded birds sharing the same rank. Young males establish their individual status before pairing with females. Upon pairing, the female assumes the same social position as her partner. Unmated females are the lowest members in the pecking order, and are the last {{to have access to}} food and shelter. Lorenz noted one case in which a male, absent during the dominance struggles and pair bondings, returned to the flock, became the dominant male, and chose one of two <b>unpaired</b> females for a mate. This female immediately assumed a dominant position in the social hierarchy and demonstrated this by pecking others. According to Lorenz, the most significant factor in social behaviour was the immediate and intuitive grasp of the new hierarchy by each of the western jackdaws in the flock.|$|E
5|$|Nitric oxide (NO) is the {{simplest}} stable molecule {{with an odd}} number of electrons. In mammals, including humans, {{it is an important}} cellular signaling molecule involved in many physiological and pathological processes. It is formed by catalytic oxidation of ammonia. It is a colourless paramagnetic gas that, being thermodynamically unstable, decomposes to nitrogen and oxygen gas at 1100–1200°C. Its bonding is similar to that in nitrogen, but one extra electron is added to a π* antibonding orbital and thus the bond order has been reduced to approximately 2.5; hence dimerisation to O=N–N=O is unfavourable except below the boiling point (where the cis isomer is more stable) because it does not actually increase the total bond order and because the <b>unpaired</b> electron is delocalised across the NO molecule, granting it stability. There is also evidence for the asymmetric red dimer O=N–O=N when nitric oxide is condensed with polar molecules. It reacts with oxygen to give brown nitrogen dioxide and with halogens to give nitrosyl halides. It also reacts with transition metal compounds to give nitrosyl complexes, most of which are deeply coloured.|$|E

40|$|For {{many years}} {{there has been}} a debate between proponents of {{competing}} learning theories over the role of expectancy in conditioning and extinction. Although this debate {{has been the subject of}} an intensive experimental literature, it has not been satisfactorily resolved. Many research designs are intrinsically incapable of dissociating the influence of expectancy from other factors held to be important by competing theories. However, the informed <b>unpairing</b> design (Brewer, 1974), in which subjects are informed of changed contingencies at the onset of extinction, is argued to provide a powerful test of expectancy, two factor, and conditioning theories. It is also argued that the bidirectional vasomotor response provides a solution to the related problems of expectancy manipulation and artifact control that confound previous research using this design. A programme of research based on the informed <b>unpairing</b> design, and using the vasomotor response, was undertaken. Responding in extinction following several expectancy manipulation procedures was compared in subjects given 25 continuously reinforced acquisition trials (CRF 25); 100 continuously reinforced trials (CRF 100); and 100 partially reinforced trials (PRF). It was found that responding in CRF 25 and PRF groups in extinction was abolished by <b>unpairing</b> instructions coupled with removal of the thermal stimulator used for UCS presentation. A significant reduction in responding in CRF 25 and PRF groups was also obtained following <b>unpairing</b> instruction alone as compared with groups given no instruction. The CRF 25 group instructed at the onset of extinction that they would be reinforced on a PRF schedule showed a non significant trend for greater resistance to extinction than those given no instruction. These results provide strong support for an expectancy based, rather than two factor or conditioning based, explanation of responding in these groups. However, no effects of expectancy manipulation on responding in extinction were obtained in CRF 100 groups, and attempts to generate responding in two groups by instruction alone proved unsuccessful. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that there may be two conditioning processes; one expectancy dependent and the other expectancy independent. Existing learning theories based on two conditioning processes are unable to account for all of the results of the present research. However, it is argued that the results of the present study are consistent with a number of studies in the skill learning literature. Models proposed to account for skill learning which distinguish between processes involved in acquisition and early performance, and those involved in much practised responding, provide a possible explanation for the obtained results. Consequences of the research for the behaviour therapies are discussed...|$|R
