40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the dynamic analog of the higher-order shear {{deformation}} plate theory developed by the senior author. The theory {{is based on a}} displacement field in which the inplane displacements are expanded as cubic functions of the thicknes coordinate and the transverse deflection is assumed to be constant through the thickness. The additional dependent <b>unkowns</b> introduced with the quadratic and cubic terms of the thickness coordinate are eliminated by requiring the transverse shear stresses to vanish on the bounding planes of the plate. The theory accounts for the parabolic distribution of the transverse shear stresses, and hence no shear correction coefficients are required...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{consider}} the discretization of the Stokes problem on domain partitions with non-matching meshes. We propose a hybrid mortar method, which is motivated by a variational characterization of solutions of the corresponding interface problem. For the discretization of the subdomain problems, we utilize standard inf-sup stable finite element pairs. The introduction of additional <b>unkowns</b> at the interface allows to reduce the coupling between the subdomain problems, which comes from the variational incorporation of interface conditions. We present {{a detailed analysis of}} the hybrid mortar method, in particular, the discrete inf-sup stability condition is proven under weak assumptions on the interface mesh, and optimal a-priori error estimates are derived with respect to the energy and L 2 -norm. For illustration of the results, we present some numerical tests...|$|R

The analytic and geometrical properties of these curves are derived together with a discussion on their use in algorithms. Key words: Nonlinear least squares, optimization, L-curve, regularization, Gauss-Newton method 1 Introduction Inverse problems appear in many different engineering applications. An inverse problem consists of a direct problem and some unknown function(s) or parameter(s). In many cases the solution does not depend continuously on the unknown quantities {{and the problem is}} ill-posed. A typical ill-posed problem is when the task is to determine these <b>unkowns</b> given measured, inexact, data. Given such an ill-posed problem {{it is a good idea}} to reformulate the original problem into a well-posed problem giving a solution that is not too large and with a small residual. 1. 1 An example from [...] ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Electroencephalographiy (EEG) and Magnetoencephalography (MEG) are two {{non-invasive}} imaging modalities {{that measures}} the brain activity. Obtaining the brain activity with the distributed source model from these measurements is an ill-posed problem {{due to the}} high number of unknowns compared to the number of measurements. A unique solution is obtained by assuming a prior on the sources. The idea is to reduce the solution space size from the number of sources (S) to a smaller space. Assuming that sources inside each functional region have equal activation allows us {{to reduce the number of}} columns in the leadfield matrix from S to a number of regions (K). These regions are obtained from a dMRI parcellation-based region growing algorithm. A region is assumed to contain sources that have similar fibers distribution. To obtain a sparse solution, we assume that only a few regions are active simultaneously. BIC 1 is used to obtain the optimal number of regions (Kp) that explains the MEG/EEG data. We compared the results of the proposed method to the ones from Minimum Norm Estimate (MNE) and LASSO 2. The first gives a smooth solution and the second gives a sparse solution. To test the accuracy of the reconstruction, we activated simultaneously from two to five regions in both hemispheres with synthetic low SNR signals (10 dB). Our approach could detect the right number of activated regions and provided more accurate reconstructions compared to MNE and LASSO. Our approach assumes that few regions are active simultaneously which allows us to reduce the space to a few <b>unkowns.</b> It can be seen as an approximation to the l 0 norm. Even though assuming a constant activation in each functional region is a hard constraint, but it allows us to reduce the space size from S to K. The obtained solution can be used to detect extended sources (e. g epileptic activity) or as an initialization step to other approaches to obtain focal solutions in the active regions...|$|R
