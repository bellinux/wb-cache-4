40|$|Biodiesel is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} promising alternative fuels for diesel engines due its renewability and environment friendly nature. As the process of lipid extraction from the biomass consumes about 90 % of the total energy spent for biodiesel production, an efficient and economic method is very important. The amount of lipid extracted from the biomass could be increased if it is pre-treated before the extraction process. This work was an attempt to compare the various pre-treatment methods before extracting lipids from dried Salvinia molesta (aquatic weed), such as autoclaving, microwaving, ultrasonication, sand, and glass grinding. After each pre-treatment method, Bligh and Dyer's method was used to measure the total lipid content in percentage dry weight (% dwt), which was then compared with the untreated S. molesta. It was found experimentally that the lipid yield was 19. 97 % dwt for ultrasonication > 16. 60 % dwt for microwaving > 16. 46 % dwt for glass grinding > 16. 26 % dwt for sand grindin, > 15. 72 % dwt for autoclaving > 15. 36 % dwt for untreated. The one-way ANOVA with Tukey's test was then used to validate the experimental results and showed that ultrasonication method of pre-treatment was the most efficient and had resulted in the highest lipid yield among all the methods used which was followed by the microwaving method. The Taguchi method with L 9 orthogonal array was then used for the optimization of <b>ultrasonic</b> assisted <b>pre-treatment</b> method before extracting lipid from S. molesta and showed a maximum lipid of 20. 86 % using 100 % amplitude and sonication time of 15 [*]min. The fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) of S. molesta lipid was analyzed using gas chromatography mass spectroscopy (GCMS) with flame ionization detector. It showed fatty acids such as C 14 : 0, C 14 : 1, C 16 : 0, C 16 : 1, C 18 : 0, C 18 : 1, C 20 : 1, C 20 : 4, C 22 : 0 which contributed 97. 38 % weight of the total fatty acids.

40|$|Membrane {{filtration}} is {{a popular}} solid/liquid (S/L) separation process used in water and wastewater treatment, since it {{plays a key role}} in removing from water complex components such as dissolved and particulate matter contaminants. Membrane filtration processes are used as an alternative to other more traditional separation methods, such as simple filtration, centrifugation, sedimentation etc., since they offer the advantages of a highly selective operation, separation with few auxiliary materials, ambient temperature operation, usually no phase changes; the process is also economical in small units, it is modular in construction and may be easily integrated in existing production processes, requiring relatively low capital and running costs. Fouling is the major factor limiting membrane lifetime. Fouling is a generic term, which describes the gradual deterioration of membrane performance in terms of permeation flux and selectivity, mainly due to the accumulation of solids on its surface and/or inside its pores. Several techniques have been implemented to prevent the particles reaching the membrane surface, which include the use of abrasives, filtration aids, and coagulants. On the other hand, feed <b>pre-treatment,</b> <b>ultrasonic</b> fields, periodic backflushing, and gas sparging are used to remove particles that already have been deposited in the membrane pores or on its surface. Flotation is another S/L separation process, in which the lifting force of bubbles (usually of air) is used for the removal of suspended matter from dispersions. The process is widely applied to the removal of organics from water, the removal of metal ions, oils, powders, and residual reagents from wastewater etc., as well as for the beneficiation of mineral particles in minerals processing. A combination of membrane filtration and air sparging integrated into a single unit could reduce fouling by removing a large part of the solid particles: the rising gas bubble swarm acts as a surface scrubber, preventing the solid particles from being deposited on the membrane surface and also scrubbing the membrane surface and removing the deposited cake. This combined process could be further improved if a surface-active agent was added to the suspension, making the solid particles hydrophobic: most of the solid particles would then be removed by flotation at the top of the cell by the rising bubbles. The innovative hybrid flotation/microfiltration system consists of a membrane module submerged inside a flotation column. A suspension of fine-sized adsorbent particles was fed into the hybrid cell, where the solid particles were partially removed by flotation, while clean water was obtained from the membrane module. Some of the solid particles remaining in the dispersion were deposited on the surface of the membrane, forming a cake that gradually caused membrane fouling. The rising gas bubbles were used for the flotation process, while at the same time acting as membrane-surface scrubbers, effectively removing the deposited cake and countering the fouling problem. Process parameters investigated were: the nature, size, and concentration of solid particles (zeolite, hydrotalcite, Zn(OH) 2 precipitate and iron colloidal particles), the type and concentration of selected ions (Zn 2 +, P-PO 4 3 -), the type and concentration of flotation reagents, the effect of gas flow rate and of solid-liquid dispersion flow rate, and the frequency and length of backflushing, which was required in order to reduce the fouling of membranes and to extend their useful working time, among others. ...|$|R

This compound is effective against a wide range of insects and arthropods but its usage has raised several concerns to human health and surrounding environment. To combat its negative effects, there has been an overwhelming interest of producing essential oil products from different species of natural plant materials in order to access their repellent properties. Essential oils are odourless volatile mixture of hydrocarbons and their repellent properties have been linked to the presence of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. Therefore, it is important to identify a best technique to extract the essential oil without causing significant effect on their chemical -constituents, since the conventional methods implied years back are time consuming and also record a low extraction yield.

In previous research by Lambert et al. (2016), a long-term experimental study of 120 days at a biodiesel production plant demonstrated that ultrasonic sludge disintegration {{can result in a}} substantial reduction of waste sludge of about 45 %, and this at a relatively low specific energy. Moreover, it was revealed from this pilot experiment that the efficiency of the excess sludge reduction, indicated as SRE (Sludge Reduction Efficiency), increases when the activated sludge plant is operated at a higher sludge retention time (SRT). This is an important finding, because this would mean that the ultrasonic technology can be operated more cost efficiently at a higher sludge retention time. To confirm this finding and to give a deeper insight into the underlying mechanisms and long-term effects that promote the excess sludge reduction, lab-scale aerobic digestion experiments were performed. Both the endogenous respiration rate and the VSS concentration were monitored during the 30 days’ experimental period, and could give more information about the fate and the biodegradation of the particulate COD in activated sludge.

To increase the diamond nucleation rate and prevent the rapid diffusion of hydrogen and carbon into the substrate, different surface treatments and interlayers were studied in this paper. Results showed that polishing with diamond pastes and <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>pre-treatment</b> in diamond suspensions will significantly increase the nuclei density of diamond crystals. However, the diffusion of hydrogen into the substrate could not be prevented. Pre-etching of the titanium substrate using hydrogen plasma for a short time significantly increased the nuclei density of diamond crystals. Results showed that on a TiN interlayer, there was no significant improvement in diamond nucleation and growth, and the deposited diamond coatings showed poor adhesion. New diamond crystals were formed on the DLC interlayer in which DLC acted as the precursor for diamond nucleation. However, the so-formed diamond coating showed spallation. The plasma nitrided layer could prevent the rapid diffusion of hydrogen and carbon into the titanium substrate, but results showed a relatively low nucleation density of diamond crystals and poor adhesion. A graded interlayer combining plasma nitriding followed by plasma carbonitriding was effective in preventing the rapid diffusion of hydrogen and carbon into the substrate and improving the nucleation rate and adhesion of diamond coating...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of the nucleation density {{on the development of}} the morphology of ultrananocrystalline diamond/amorphous carbon (UNCD/a-C) composite films and their mechanical properties has been investigated by variation of the substrate pre-treatment used to enhance the nucleation. The films have been prepared by microwave plasma chemical vapour deposition from 17 % CH 4 /N 2 mixtures on silicon substrates. Their morphology and topography have been characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). It is shown that by successive addition of ultradispere diamond powder (3 - 5 nm average grain size) to the suspension of nanocrystalline diamond powder (250 nm average grain size) in n-pentane used for the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>pre-treatment,</b> the nucleation density can be enhanced by two orders of magnitude from 1 × 108 cm- 2 to higher than 1 × 1010 cm- 2. This changes the morphology of the films from individual nodules to uniform coatings and reduces the thickness required to achieve closed films. The mechanical properties of these films have been investigated by nanoindentation and nanoscratch tests. The determined hardness was about 25 - 28 GPa for all samples under investigation, the elastic modulus 262 - 271 GPa, and the elastic recovery 62 - 65 %, revealing the {{influence of}} the amorphous carbon matrix. The scratch tests proved a strong adhesion of the UNCD/a-C coatings and their protective effect on silicon substrates. The nucleation density has no distinct influence on the mechanical properties of the closed films. JRC. DDG. I. 5 -Nanobioscience...|$|E

The worldwide yeast extract business is large and may increase with the interest in natural products and nutrients. The wastes from the yeast extract industry have traditionally been used as animal food or soil injection for agricultural benefit. This process is now being challenged and is experiencing increasing costs therefore alternative options for disposal routes are being considered. The poor biodegradability of activated sludge cell walls is well known {{and it has been}} suggested that the rigid, double layered yeast cells will be even more recalcitrant. Previous work reviewed in the thesis, had indicated yeast cell walls are some of the most refractory natural microbes in comparison, for example with activated sludge. The thesis revisits the issue of solids hydrolysis and in particular with a waste containing yeast cell walls as model solids. The literature review discusses previous work on the treatment of yeast containing wastes, including reactor designs and potential pre-treatments. It covers the work done on the fundamental characteristics of solids which might affect biodegradation rates, e. g. particle size, cross linking, rigidity and viscosity. Laboratory experiments were conducted and the results analysed from batch biodegradability testing and continuous simulation trials comparing anaerobic reactors. These were CSTR, Filters and UASB the latter noted for its vulnerability to solids. Laboratory work is also reported on the potential for ultrasonic, thermal and acclimatization to improve degradation rates.

40|$|Polycrystalline diamond films (DF) {{grown from}} {{hydrocarbons}} at low pressures is highly attractive material for optical, mechanical, electronic and other applications, {{in which the}} unique {{physical and chemical properties}} of diamond are used. Fabrication of diamond-based electronic devices requires a high resolution patterning of DF, however a conventional post-growth processing (polishing, etching [...] .) is difficult because of extreme hardness and chemical inertness of diamond. We report on alternative method to produce fine structures in DF - selected-area diamond deposition on laser-irradiated substrates. CVD diamond films have polycrystalline structure because the film growth is initiated independently on selected nucleation sites randomly distributed over substrate surface. The diamond nucleation sites were artificially created on polished Si wafer by seeding the ultrafine (5 nm) diamond powder using <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>pre-treatment</b> of the substrate. Then those seeds were removed at selected areas under action of a finely focussed beam of Ar+ laser (488 nm wavelength) scanned over surface under computer control. At the final step the DF was deposited in DC arc discharge plasma in methane (5 %) /hydrogen (95 %) gas mixtures [1]. Only at unexposed areas the DF did grow, while the growth was totally suppressed at the laser-modified surface. Micron-sized DF patterns have been fabricated by this way. The mechanisms of nucleation centres annihilation, and the role of ambient atmosphere (air, argon) in this effect are discussed. It is shown also that a laser pre-treatment of Si may result in a significant reducing in DF surface roughness, Ra. Smooth DF with Ra [MATH] were grown, {{that could be used for}} optical coating, antifriction coatings and insulating layers in electronic devices...|$|E
40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} {{the capability of}} X-ray Micro-computed Tomography (XMT) technique to characterise the internal ice crystal microstructure of freeze-dried samples (strawberry). The method requires the fruit being frozen under specific freezedrying temperature of the samples to remove frozen water before scanning to indicateice crystal and internal structure of the samples. Results are presented for the 2 -D ice crystals formed within the samples. The dendrite spacing (size, volume and width) of ice crystals is related to freezing condition of the samples. Only 1 % small intercellular voids distribution of the total 99 % volume in fresh strawberry samples as compared to 72 % void or pore distribution in freeze-dried samples. Other than that, the average width size of ice crystal for two different operating freezing (- 20 oC and - 80 oC) temperatures for strawberry samples was 0. 15 to 0. 29 mm and 0. 29 to 0. 40 mm respectively. The overall {{results indicate that the}} ice crystal distribution within samples were diverse with the axial distance of the material from its cooling surface. The ice crystal size is bigger when the fruits were far from the cooling surface. At the investigated conditions, the comparisons with air-drying technique had been done on jackfruit and the study on those fruits had been limited to image visualization for validation and nutrient analysis. Samples dried in the freeze dryer were seen to retain their shape much better than air dried samples which underwent shrinkage and change in color. Samples dried in freeze dryer possessed less dense structures and consequently displayed more favorable rehydrated textural properties than the air-dried equivalents. Furthermore the total phenolic (TP), and ascorbic acid (AA) of the fresh and freezedried samples had been investigated. This method had preserved 3. 65 mg/mL AA concentration in freeze-dried strawberry samples with <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>pre-treatment</b> and no AA had been detected in the air-dried strawberry samples.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{doctoral}} dissertation was to improve the production of methane by mechanical and enzymatic pretreatments of organic substrates. For anaerobic digestion of different substrates and determination of biomethane potential, Automatic Methane Potential Test System (AMPTS II) device was used. AMPTS II is an analytical laboratory scale device used in measurements of ultra low speed production of biomethane produced during the anaerobic digestion of biodegradable substrates. Although biogas yields of biogas plants arelimited to the specific substrates, methane yields are difficult to generalize from the collected data in published literature due to different modifications of substrates, including particle size reduction or chemical pretreatment all affecting their properties and energy recovery. Therefore, for biogas plant decision making the data need {{to be derived from}} inoculum of concrete biogas plant and substrates in such a condition as to be dosed in anaerobic reactors on real industrial scale. By upgrading commercial system AMPTS II from 0. 5 liters to 5 liters, a pilot scale device was developed and validated for such real-scale experiments mirroring anaerobic reactors at the biogas plant. On 5 liter pilot scale biomethane yield of 24 substrates in solid or liquid form was assessed and compared with existing published data. By adding a variety of additives in the form of enzymes and micro-organisms in the process of anaerobic digestion, the impact on the production of methane and enhancement of the production of methane was evaluated. A combination of different substrates from paper mill sludge from Kraft process, a dehydrated paper mill sludge, bio-waste and lignocellulosic substrate an optimization of methane production in batch mode was conducted. The effects of the addition of hydrolytic enzymes on the production of methane from dehydrated paper mill sludge from Paloma was further tested in semi - continuous experiments. Significant improvements were detected. In the next following semi - continuous experiments an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>pre-treatment</b> of sludge from the treatment plant in combination with the addition of hydrolytic enzymes was tested. In addition, the operation of the biogas plant Vučja vas was monitored for a period of 5 months during the substrate fluctuation period.

40|$|The rate of {{anaerobic}} digestion (AD) often {{depends on the}} rate-limiting hydrolysis step that makes organics available to microorganisms. To achieve efficient conversion of particulates to soluble materials and finally methane, the biomass in the digester must be provided with optimal operational conditions that will allow for biomass retention and substrate metabolism. Two approaches were employed in this study to improve the ultimate biodegradability of waste activated sludge (WAS) - Pre-treatment (PT) and operation using an Anaerobic Membrane Bioreactor (AnMBR). PT of WAS {{is one way of}} speeding up hydrolysis. It has been proposed that PT leads to the lysis of cells, which in turn causes the release and solubilisation, and thus availability of intracellular matter to microorganisms for microbial growth and metabolic activities. This study compared the effect of thermal, sonication, and sonication + hydrogen peroxide PT on chemical oxygen demand (COD) solubilisation of WAS. Based on the soluble COD (SCOD) release, it was concluded that combined chemi-sonic treatment resulted in better WAS degradation rather than individual <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>pre-treatment</b> and thermal PT. The highest solubilisation rate was observed at a chemi-sonic PT of 50 gH 2 O 2 /kgTS and sonication duration of 60 minutes. At this PT, a COD solubilisation of 40 % was observed which was significantly different than PT involving only sonication and no pre-treatment (0. 88 %) at 95 % confidence. Therefore a peroxide-sonic PT was chosen to treat WAS in this study as it was expected to result in the greatest improvement in WAS biodegradability. In addition to PT, biodegradability of WAS can also be improved by coupling PT with an AnMBR. AnMBRs prevent biomass washout by decoupling the solids retention time (SRT) from the hydraulic retention time (HRT). Thus, a long SRT can be used to provide sufficient duration for biological activities without increasing the volume of the reactor. In this study, a 4. 5 L AnMBR with an HRT and SRT of 3 and 20 days, respectively was used to treat raw and PT WAS. In order to compare the biodegradability of PT and raw WAS, the AnMBR was operated in three phases. Phase 1 was operated with raw WAS, Phase 2 was operated with WAS pre-treated with 50 gH 2 O 2 /kgTS and 20 minutes ultrasound (US), and Phase 3 was operated with WAS pre-treated with 50 gH 2 O 2 /kgTS and 60 minutes US. The anaerobic biodegradability of WAS following a combination of <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>pre-treatment</b> and H 2 O 2 addition was significantly improved, with Phase 3 resulting in the greatest improvement. The COD destruction for phases 1, 2, and 3 were 49 %, 58 %, and 63 %, respectively whereas the volatile suspended solids (VSS) destruction for phases 1, 2, and 3 were 46 %, 71 %, and 77 % respectively. Organic Nitrogen (Org-N) destruction increased from 44 % to 52 % for phases 1 and 2 respectively. A further increase of 18 % in Org-N destruction was observed in phase 3. This improvement in biodegradability of WAS was attributed to the high solubilisations of COD, VSS, and ON and conversion of non-biodegradable materials to biodegradable fractions. In order to determine the effect of PT of WAS on membrane performance, the transmembrane pressure (TMP) and fouling rate were monitored throughout the operation of the AnMBR. Negligible variation in membrane performance was observed over all three phases. At a constant low flux of 2. 75 litres/m 2 /hour (LMH), the TMP and the fouling rate remained low over the course of operation. In order to maintain the performance of the membrane, maintenance cleaning with 50 ml of 2 g/L critic acid solution followed by 50 ml of 0. 2 g/L sodium hypochlorite was performed three times a week. In addition, a gas sparing rate of 2 L/minute and a permeation cycle of 10 minutes with 8 minutes of operation followed by 2 minutes of relaxation was employed. During phase 2 of this study, a new membrane was installed due to a faulty gas sparging pump. A slight decrease of TMP was observed with the installation of the new membrane; however the decrease was minimal. In addition critical flux for phases 2 and 3 were determined to be in the range of 6 to 12 LMH. In conclusion, the incorporation of H 2 O 2 -US PT with AD could allow treatment plants to substantially reduce the mass flow of solids and organics and thus result in a decrease in requirements for downstream sludge processing. With sufficient maintenance, steady operation could be achieved for a hollow fibre AnMBR with a total solids concentration range of 20 - 25 g/L, an HRT of 3 days, and an SRT of 20 days. It was found that PT could be successfully integrated with AnMBR to substantially reduce the HRT required for digestion when compared to conventional designs...|$|E
30|$|The {{pre-treatment}} {{duration time}} {{is related to}} the applied temperature in order to accomplish an efficient pre-treatment. It can be assumed that good results are expected with a simultaneous short duration of time and high temperatures or using prolonged treatments at relatively low temperatures. Yoon et al. pre-treated the sugarcane bagasse with [emim][CH 3 COO] and proposed a model based on Response Surface Methodology (RSM) to predict the reducing sugar yield by changing temperature, time and biomass loading [43]. An improvement in reducing sugar yield at longer pre-treatment at lower temperature (120 °C) was noticed. However, prolonged pre-treatment could lead to decrease in reducing sugar yield under higher temperatures (more than 135 °C), explained by a depolymerisation process of the biomass components [43]. Sun et al. observed that complete dissolution of southern yellow pine and red oak in [emim][CH 3 COO] at 110 °C was achieved after 46 and 25  hours, respectively [25]. However, the improved dissolution capacity provided by a longer pre-treatment time is inevitably accompanied by some degradation of either the dissolved biopolymers or the IL [25, 67]. After <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>pre-treatment</b> of kenaf powder with [emim][CH 3 COO] at 110 °C, the hemicellulose content decreases in the regenerated biomass to 6 wt% after 120  minutes [50]. The reduced biomass recovery was attributed to partial hydrolysis of hemicellulose. Therefore, not only compound degradation occurs, but also the hydrolysis of hemicellulose to reducing sugars that are then lost in the washing stream [50]. Nguyen et al. demonstrated that an increase in the solubility time of rice straw in [emim][CH 3 COO] caused a higher cellulose recovery, at least after 24  hours [51]. However, after 48  hours of pre-treatment, the regenerated particles were difficult to collect due to long time applied to profoundly break down cellulose chains from rice straw into soluble oligosaccharides. There was no regeneration in amorphous cellulose form, thus decreased cellulose recovery was observed [51]. In fact, the mean molecular weight of dissolved compounds was found to decrease as the treatment time was extended [84], thus the compound regeneration was more difficult. Pre-treatment of sugarcane bagasse with [emim][CH 3 COO] tends to form a coagulate at higher temperatures for a prolonged duration time. This leads to a difficult regeneration of the dissolved sugarcane bagasse from the coagulate [43]. Significant amount of residual [emim][CH 3 COO] could be imprisoned in the coagulate, which might cause cellulase inactivation and consequently lead to a decrease in reducing sugar yield [85]. Furthermore, when higher temperatures are applied in biomass pre-treatment for elevated periods of processing, cellulose degradation is more pronounced [71, 86]. Thus, shorter retention times are recommended when high temperatures used, although this must be balanced with the IL stability and potential side reactions [40]. Tan et al. demonstrated that, for a shorter pre-treatment time, the glucose recovery yield increased almost linearly from 26.2 % to 96.7 % as the temperature increased from 60 to 100 °C by pre-treating oil palm frond with [bmim][Cl] [86]. Nevertheless, [emim][CH 3 COO] demonstrates more efficiency in disrupting the lignocellulosic structure in a shorter period of time, since it has a faster diffusion rate resulting in higher glucose recovery yields [64]. The crystallinity degree of cellulose-rich material after regeneration was also found to decrease to an amorphous state as pre-treatment time increased [69].|$|E
30|$|The {{pre-treatment}} of {{crop residues}} were also performed using different ILs. The [emim][CH 3 COO] was {{suitable for a}} 48 -hour pre-treatment of rice straw providing 82 % of cellulose recovery with subsequently 88 % conversion to glucose after 130 °C [51]. The same biomass was treated for 5 hours at 120 °C with [bmim][CH 3 COO] and lignin content was reduced by 8.2 %. Xylan content was also decreased from 21.7 % for untreated rice straw to 15.1 % for the pre-treated biomass [90]. Rice straw was pre-treated using the amino acid-based IL namely, [Ch][Lys], [Ch][Gly], [Ch][Ala], [Ch][Ser], [Ch][Thr], [Ch][Met], [Ch][Pro] and [Ch][Phe] [66]. In all cases, the content of cellulose increased from 37.7 % in the original biomass to 48 – 62 % after pre-treatment {{and the content of}} acid-insoluble lignin decreased from 16.9 % of original lignin content to 10 – 12 % in the regenerated material (depending on the IL used). A strong correlation between enzyme performance and delignification of rice straw was observed. A total of 94 % and 65 % cellulose and xylan digestibility, respectively, were obtained after pre-treatment with [Ch][Lys], [Ch][Gly], [Ch][Ala], and [Ch][Met] that were the most efficient in lignin extraction (> 55 %) [66]. Cotton stalk was subjected to pre-treatments with several ionic liquids such as [HEA][HCOO], [amim][Cl], [bmim][Cl], [emim][Cl] and [emim][CH 3 COO]. The extracted lignin ranged between 31 % and 46 %, where maximum removal yields were obtained for pre-treatments with [emim][CH 3 COO] and [amim][Cl], determined to be 45 % and 46 %, respectively [63]. Kenaf pre-treatment was additionally performed with five types of ILs, such as [amim][Cl], [bmim][Cl], [emim][Cl], [emim][DEP] and [emim][CH 3 COO] [50]. The cellulose saccharification ratio was about 20 % for kenaf powders pre-treated in [amim][Cl], [bmim][Cl], [emim][Cl] and [emim][DEP] by conventional heating at 110 °C for 2  hours. The glucose yield was further increased when ultrasonic radiation was used for the same ILs with a 60 - 95 % glucose yield after 120  minutes at only 25 °C. The cellulose saccharification ratio of kenaf powder in [emim][CH 3 COO] was 86 % after 15  minutes of <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>pre-treatment</b> at 25 °C, compared to only 47 % {{in the case of the}} thermal pre-treatment in the same IL. However, it seems that the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>pre-treatment</b> leads to a higher loss material in the liquid phase than for the conventional oil heating pre-treatment [50]. Wu et al. reported a 33 % (w/w) loading of corn stover pre-treated with [emim][CH 3 COO] as an efficient pre-treatment, in terms of the biomass loading, since it removed 15 % of the total lignin from the original biomass [41]. The best result was obtained by a pre-treatment with a biomass loading of 4.8 % at 125 °C for 1  hour giving a lignin extraction of 43.5 %. The regenerated material was determined to compose a 63.4 % carbohydrate and still remained 13.3 % lignin [41]. At 130 °C wheat straw was pre-treated with [emim][DEP] (4 % w/w) resulting in a porous and amorphous regenerated material, with only 54.8 % of reducing sugar yield attained possibly due to only a 30 -minute pre-treatment process [91]. The dissolution of sugarcane bagasse in [bmim][Cl] at high temperatures, such as 140 °C and 150 °C, was reported to be incomplete [76]. The undissolved material was first separated before regeneration of the dissolved material, the composition of which was practically the same as that of the original biomass. The results showed a composition of a regenerated material (without undissolved biomass) of 77 % cellulose at 140 °C and 82 % at 150 °C. The lignin and hemicellulose content proportionally decreased as the temperature increased. At 150 °C, the lower lignin and hemicellulose content of the regenerated material can be attributed to both preferential dissolution of cellulose and to an increased degradation of hemicellulose and lignin during the pre-treatment process. The pre-treatment efficiency was then evaluated by enzymatic hydrolysis and the best results were obtained for a pre-treatment at 150 °C for 90  minutes [76]. Sant’Ana da Silva et al. demonstrated that only a 30 -minute sugarcane pre-treatment at 120 °C with [emim][CH 3 COO] gave a regenerated biomass very susceptible for saccharification [69]. Yields above 95 % and 76 % of glucose and xylose were achieved, respectively. The [emim][CH 3 COO] IL was mixed with energy cane bagasse at a 20 : 1 ratio [92]. It was observed that 15.1 % of the total mass was lost during pre-treatment with IL and 52.6 % of the loss was attributed to lignin removal. Composition of analysis revealed that 32.1 % of the initial lignin was removed in IL-treated energy cane samples. Specifically, 41.7 % of the initial acid insoluble lignin was removed from energy cane. The loss of glucan in IL-treated samples was less than 9 % and cellulose digestibility of pre-treated sample at 24  hours was approximately 25 and 22 times higher than untreated and water-treated samples, respectively. The hemicellulose digestibility followed the same trend as that observed for cellulose [92]. Tan et al. used oil palm frond that was pre-treated with [bmim][Cl] at different pre-treatment conditions [86]. The pre-treatment variables studied were temperature, time and solid loading. Under the pre-treatment conditions of 4 wt% solid loading at 100 °C, the lignin removal efficiency reached its maximum in less than a half hour. The lignin content decreased from 33.63 % in original biomass to 17.91 %, i.e., close to 50 % of the lignin was extracted. During the pre-treatment process the cellulose loss was determined to be around 4 - 9 % [33]. Indeed, ILs are able to depolymerise polysaccharides in biomass to compounds with low molecular weight. ILs with greater depolymerisation power cause greater loss of reducing sugar during pre-treatment providing higher mass loss of carbohydrates. The dissolved polysaccharides undergo different degrees of depolymerisation and reducing sugar loss when pre-treated with different types of ILs. Sugarcane bagasse was pre-treated with [bmim][Cl] and 6.7 mg[*]·[*]mL- 1 of reducing sugars was detected in IL. In the case of the pre-treatment with [emim][DEP], 2.7 mg[*]·[*]mL- 1 of reducing sugars were detected in IL, whereas [emim][CH 3 COO] was ineffective in depolymerisation of polysaccharides during pre-treatment (insignificant amount of reducing sugar was detected) [33]. Tan et al. claimed that depolymerisation of cellulose occurs under acidic conditions in the ionic liquid media during pre-treatment [71]. The acidic conditions are created by degradation products, namely acetic acid and carboxylic acid released from hemicellulose hydrolysis upon pre-treatment. Under acidic conditions IL had the ability to hydrolyse cellulose causing significant losses. The loss products are essentially formed by carbohydrate oligomers and monomers that are soluble in the antisolvent and failed to be regenerated [71]. Van Spronsen et al. presumed that water is formed at temperatures higher than 100 °C from dehydration [27]. The components of lignocellulosic biomass were then exposed for hydrolysis. Hemicellulose could be further hydrolysed into acetic acid, which subsequently may act as a catalyst to the hydrolysis process of cellulose and the remaining hemicellulose [27]. The lesser depolymerisation observed for [emim][CH 3 COO] could be explained by the buffering effect exhibited by a very basic [CH 3 COO] anion. Its ability to combine with protons to form acetic acid may limit the acid-catalysed hydrolysis of hemicellulose polymers [53]. If the resultant products of degradation and hydrolysis are low macromolecular weight compounds, the probability of its recovery in the regeneration process is lower.
