5|$|The Brooklyn Free School is a private, <b>ungraded,</b> {{democratic}} free {{school in}} Fort Greene, Brooklyn, founded in 2004. Students {{range in age}} from 4 to 18 years old. The school follows the noncoercive philosophy of the 1960s/70s free school movement schools, which encourages self-directed learning and protects child freedom of activity. There are no grades, no tests, and classes are non-compulsory. As of 2015, the school enrolls 80 students and has about 24 graduates.|$|E

25|$|Blocking {{plasticity}} in {{this region}} results in problems in goal-directed navigation and impairs the ability to remember precise locations. Amnesic patients with damage to the hippocampus cannot learn or remember spatial layouts and patients having undergone hippocampal removal are severely impaired in spatial navigation. Monkeys with lesions to this area cannot learn object-place associations and rats also display spatial deficits by not reacting to spatial change. In addition, rats with hippocampal lesions were shown to have temporally <b>ungraded</b> (time-independent) retrograde amnesia that is resistant to recognition of a learned platform task only when the entire hippocampus is lesioned, but not when it is partially lesioned. Deficits in spatial memory are also found in spatial discrimination tasks.|$|E

It has a massive <b>ungraded</b> composition and is likely a lahar or debris flow deposit, probably influenced by glacial or crater lake water. Wind-driven effects have generated hummocky ridges.|$|E
500|$|In 1872, a {{lobbying}} campaign by {{residents of the}} town of Brill led to the tramway being converted for passenger use and extended a short distance beyond Wood Siding to Brill railway station, becoming known as the Brill Tramway.

Instead, the operation of the line was taken over by the Metropolitan Railway in 1899. Between 1908 and 1910 the station was completely rebuilt on a bridge over the newly built Chiltern Main Line of the Great Western Railway, which passed directly beneath the station.|$|E
500|$|Many seminal {{lines were}} {{recorded}} before the First World War by pioneering Scottish climbers like J N Collie, Willie Naismith, Harold Raeburn, and William and Jane Inglis Clark. Other classic routes were {{put up by}} G. Graham Macphee, Dr James H. B. Bell and others between the Wars; these include Bell's 'Long Climb', at [...] reputedly the longest sustained climb on the British mainland. In summer 1943 conscientious objector Brian Kellett made a phenomenal seventy-four repeat climbs and seventeen first ascents including fourteen solos, returning in 1944 to add fifteen more new lines, eleven solo, including his eponymous HVS on Gardyloo buttress. Much more recently, an extreme and as-yet <b>ungraded</b> climb on Echo Wall was completed by Dave MacLeod in 2008 {{after two years of}} preparation.|$|E
500|$|Approximately [...] {{of a mile}} (1.2km) {{north of}} Brill, the station was opened in March 1872 {{as the result of}} {{lobbying}} from local residents and businesses. As the line was cheaply built and <b>ungraded</b> and the locomotives were of poor quality, services were very slow, initially taking 1hour 45minutes to traverse the six miles (10km) from Brill to the junction station with main line services at Quainton Road. Although serving a lightly populated area and little-used by passengers, the station was a significant point for freight traffic, particularly as a carrier of milk from the dairy farms of Buckinghamshire to Aylesbury and London. A brickworks was also attached to the station, but it proved unable to compete with nearby rivals and closed within a few years of opening.|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of the 1973 oil crisis, the 1979 energy crisis, and the {{resulting}} rise in oil prices, experimental designs using coal to fuel ships were tested in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The Australian National Lines (ANL) constructed two 74,700-ton coal-burner ships called River Boyne and River Embely. along with two constructed by TNT called TNT Capricornia and TNT Capentaria and renamed Fitzroy River and Endeavor River. These ships were financially effective for the duration of their lives, and their steam engines were able to generate a shaft-power of [...] This strategy gave an interesting advantage to carriers of bauxite and similar fuel cargoes, but suffered from poor engine yield compared to higher maintenance cost and efficient modern diesels, maintenance problems due to the supply of <b>ungraded</b> coal, and high initial costs.|$|E
500|$|In Canada, {{maple syrup}} was {{classified}} prior to December 31, 2014, by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) {{as one of}} three grades, each with several colour classes: Canada No. 1, including Extra Light, Light, and Medium; No. 2 Amber; and No. 3 Dark or any other <b>ungraded</b> category. Producers in Ontario or Québec may have followed either federal or provincial grading guidelines. Québec's and Ontario's guidelines differed slightly from the federal: there were two [...] "number" [...] categories in Québec (Number 1, with four colour classes, and 2, with five colour classes).

500|$|The Oslo Tunnel is {{the largest}} bottle-neck in the railway system in Norway, and delays caused around the tunnel can spread {{throughout}} the whole network. The local rail lines have {{only one or two}} departures per hour, but more are desired in order to attract people who want to find departure times matching work hours. The now defunct National Rail Administration had stated that until 2040 at the earliest, it is unnecessary with more capacity through the West Corridor, i.e. running west of Oslo. This includes possible <b>ungraded</b> to the railway lines around Oslo, such as high-speed lines along the Østfold and Vestfold Lines, and to Lillehammer. In 2012, after the completion of the Asker Line, a new schedule plan has been proposed. NSB, the Airport Express Train and CargoNet have all asked for more slots through the tunnel than is available. One possible solution is to decrease the reserve capacity, thus increasing the capacity from 24 to 30 trains per hour per direction. However, the tunnel is already characterized as [...] "critically overloaded".|$|E
2500|$|Access to lots at Ivy City was {{initially}} limited to dirt tracks. [...] The cutting of streets was limited until developers felt enough lots {{had been sold}} to warrant better access. [...] For example, as late as 1895, the area's roads were <b>ungraded</b> ruts lacking sidewalks and street lights, there was no storm water drainage, and fresh drinking water was provided by wells (not the city water system).|$|E
2500|$|Great Falls {{was founded}} in 1883 when {{businessman}} Paris Gibson surveyed the city and platted a permanent settlement {{on the south side}} of the river. It was incorporated on November 28, 1888. By 1890, Black Eagle Dam had been built within the city limits on the Great Falls of the Missouri River, a meat packing industry (the largest between St. Paul, Minnesota, and Spokane, Washington) had arisen, a railway had come to town, and a silver smelter had been built. The city's public school system was established in 1886. [...] That year, the city opened the Whittier Building (later known as Whittier Elementary School) and began holding <b>ungraded</b> educational instruction for all students there.|$|E
2500|$|In the <b>ungraded</b> {{situation}} described above, r0 is irrelevant, but {{in practice}} most spectral sequences occur {{in the category of}} doubly graded modules over a ring R (or doubly graded sheaves of modules over a sheaf of rings). [...] In this case, each sheet is a doubly graded module, so it decomposes as a direct sum of terms with one term for each possible bidegree. [...] The boundary map is defined as the direct sum of boundary maps on each of the terms of the sheet. [...] Their degree depends on r and is fixed by convention. [...] For a homological spectral sequence, the terms are written [...] and the differentials have bidegree ( [...] r,r1). [...] For a cohomological spectral sequence, the terms are written [...] and the differentials have bidegree (r,1r). [...] (These choices of bidegree occur naturally in practice; see the example of a double complex below.) [...] Depending upon the spectral sequence, the boundary map on the first sheet can have a degree which corresponds to r = 0, r = 1, or r = 2. [...] For example, for the spectral sequence of a filtered complex, described below, r0 = 0, but for the Grothendieck spectral sequence, r0 = 2. [...] Usually r0 is zero, one, or two.|$|E

6000|$|California was right. Tacoma was {{literally}} staggering under a {{boom of the}} boomiest. I do not quite remember what her natural resources were supposed to be, though every second man shrieked a selection in my ear. They included coal and iron, carrots, potatoes, lumber, shipping, and a crop of thin newspapers all telling Portland that her days were numbered. California and I struck the place at twilight. The rude boarded pavements of the main streets rumbled under the heels of hundreds of furious men all actively engaged in hunting drinks and eligible corner-lots. They sought the drinks first. The street itself alternated five-storey business blocks of the later and more abominable forms of architecture with board shanties. Overhead the drunken telegraph, telephone, and electric-light wires tangled on the tottering posts whose butts were half-whittled through by the knife of the loafer. Down the muddy, grimy, unmetalled thoroughfare ran a horse-car line--the metals three inches above road level. Beyond this street rose many hills, and the town was thrown like a broken set of dominoes over all. A steam tramway--it left the track the only time I used it--was nosing about the hills, but the most prominent features of the landscape were the foundations in brick and stone of a gigantic opera house and the blackened stumps of the pines. California sized up the town with one comprehensive glance. [...] "Big boom," [...] said he; and a few instants later: [...] "About time to step off, I think," [...] meaning thereby that the boom had risen to its limit, {{and it would be}} expedient not to meddle with it. We passed down <b>ungraded</b> streets that ended abruptly in a fifteen-foot drop and a nest of brambles; along pavements that beginning in pine-plank ended in the living tree; by hotels with Turkish mosque trinketry on their shameless tops, and the pine stamps at their very doors; by a female seminary, tall, gaunt and red, which a native of the town bade us marvel at, and we marvelled; by houses built in imitation of the ones on Nob Hill, San Francisco,--after the Dutch fashion; by other houses plenteously befouled with jig-saw work, and others flaring with the castlemented, battlemented bosh of the wooden Gothic school.|$|E
