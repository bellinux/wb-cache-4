25|$|While {{hydrophobic}} polymers beneficially repel {{water and}} contribute to chewiness, they also detrimentally attract oil. The stickiness of gum results from this hydrophobic nature, as gum can form bonds and stick when it makes contact with oily surfaces such as sidewalks, skin, hair, or the sole of one’s shoe. To make matters worse, <b>unsticking</b> the gum is a challenge because the long polymers of the gum base stretch, rather than break. The sticky characteristic of gum may be problematic during processing if the gum sticks to any machinery or packaging materials during processing, impeding the flow of product. Aside from ensuring that the machinery is free from lipid-based residues, this issue can be combatted by the conditioning and coating of gum {{toward the end of}} the process. By adding either a powder or a coating to the exterior of the gum product, the hydrophobic gum base binds to the added substance instead of various surfaces with which it may come in contact.|$|E

When firing, the pressure pushing the case head rearward initiated an impulse on a cam that sent the bolt carrier rearward.

Wakefield had been interested in waterborne aircraft since 1909 and had performed experiments with different float designs towed at speed across Lake Windermere. <b>Unsticking</b> problems persisted until he visited Henri Fabre in France and got useful advice on float design. The 12 ft (3.66 m) long float for the Water Bird followed Glen Curtiss' float and was built by boat builders Borwick of Bowness-on-Windermere using mahogany with aluminium and canvas.|$|E

One individual called “Betty” spontaneously made a wire tool to solve a novel problem. She was being tested to see whether she would select a wire hook rather than a straight wire to pull a little bucket of meat out of a well. Betty tried poking the straight wire at the meat. After a series of failures with this direct approach, she withdrew the wire and began directing it {{at the bottom of the}} well, which was secured to its base with duct tape. The wire soon became stuck, whereupon Betty pulled it sideways, bending it and <b>unsticking</b> it. She then inserted the hook into the well and extracted the meat. In all but one of 10 subsequent trials with only straight wire provided, she also made and used a hook in the same manner, but not before trying the straight wire first.|$|E

With its prominent sight protection ears on the receiver, [...] "dog-leg" [...] bolt handle and [...] "pot-belly" [...] magazine, it was distinctive in appearance. The action was essentially a Mauser design with some Lee-Enfield features and optimised for rapid fire, with the action cocking on closing, a feature highly valued by the British Army {{with its emphasis on}} riflemen highly trained for rapid fire, but less valued in other armies, such as the US or Germany, where cock-on-opening designs such as the M1903 Springfield and Gewehr 98 were preferred. Cock-on-opening actions became more difficult to operate when heated by rapid fire as the effort to open the bolt had to overcome the striker spring to cock the action as well as <b>unsticking</b> the fired case from the chamber. The P14 was an advanced design for the time, and was said to be the most advanced service rifle of World War I.|$|E
