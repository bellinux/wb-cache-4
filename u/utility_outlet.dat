50|$|Power was {{provided}} by two 36-volt silver-zinc potassium hydroxide non-rechargeable batteries with a capacity of 121 A·h each (a total of 242 A·h), yielding a range of 57 mi. These were used to power the drive and steering motors and also a 36-volt <b>utility</b> <b>outlet</b> mounted {{on the front of}} the LRV to power the communications relay unit or the TV camera. LRV batteries and electronics were passively cooled, using change-of-phase wax thermal capacitor packages and reflective, upward-facing radiating surfaces. While driving, radiators were covered with mylar blankets to minimize dust accumulation. When stopped, the astronauts would open the blankets, and manually remove excess dust from the cooling surfaces with hand brushes.|$|E

In the proposed system between two phases of the interleaved front-end boost converter Passive auxiliary circuit is placed, which provides enough current to charge and discharge the MOSFET’s output capacitors during the switch turned-ON. The MOSFETs are turned ON at zero voltage. The control system optimizes the amount of reactive current required to guarantee ZVS during the line cycle for different load conditions. The results show a considerable increase in efficiency and superior performance of the proposed converter compared to the conventional hard-switched interleaved boost PFC converter. Power converter paralleling architecture, interleaving technique comes naturally. In traction system, the vehicle power conditioning systems usually utilize a high-energy battery pack to store energy. The block diagram of the power conditioning system in a Vehicle is shown in Fig. 1. The high-energy battery pack is typically charged from a <b>utility</b> ac <b>outlet.</b> The full-bridge dc/dc converter for battery charging and galvanic isolation.

40|$|The role of PLUTO (Plug-in Port UTilization Officer) and {{the growth}} of the International Space Station (ISS) have {{exceeded}} the capabilities of the current tool PiP (Plug-in Plan). Its users (crew and flight controllers) have expressed an interest in a new, easy-to-use tool with a higher level of interactivity and functionality that is not bound by the limitations of Excel. The PiP Tool assists crewmembers and ground controllers in making real-time decisions concerning the safety and compatibility of hardware plugged into the UOPs (<b>Utility</b> <b>Outlet</b> Panels) onboard the ISS. The PiP Tool also provides a reference to the current configuration of the hardware plugged in to the UOPs, and enables the PLUTO and crew to test Plug-in locations for constraint violations (such as cable connector mismatches or amp limit violations), to see the amps and volts for an end item, {{to see whether or not}} the end item uses 1553 data, and the cable length between the outlet and the end item. As new equipment is flown or returned, the database can be updated appropriately as needed. The current tool is a macroheavy Excel spreadsheet with its own database and reporting functionality. The new tool captures the capabilities of the original tool, ports them to new software, defines a new dataset, and compensates for ever-growing unique constraints associated with the Plug-in Plan. New constraints were designed into the tool, and updates to existing constraints were added to provide more flexibility and customizability. In addition, there is an option to associate a "Flag" with each device that will let the user know there is a unique constraint associated with it when they use it. This helps improve the safety and efficiency of real-time calls by limiting the amount of "corporate knowledge" overhead that has to be trained and learned through use. The tool helps save time by automating previous manual processes, such as calculating connector types and deciding which cables are required and in what order...|$|E
