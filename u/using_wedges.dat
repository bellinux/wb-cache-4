40|$|Purpose. This {{pilot study}} {{investigated}} the feasibility of reducing stance phase knee hyperextension in children with cerebral palsy by tuning the ankle foot orthoses-footwear combination (AFO-FC) using different sizes of wedges. Methods. Five children with cerebral palsy underwent three dimensional gait analysis and tuning of their AFO-FC <b>using</b> <b>wedges.</b> Data analysis {{was carried out by}} comparing relevant gait parameters between the non-tuned and tuned prescription. Results. Knee hyperextension during stance significantly decreased, and the shank to vertical angle was closer to normal after tuning. Although none of the other parameters showed statistically significant changes, the wide confidence intervals and lack of power indicated the likelihood of a type II error. Further, it was noted that the influence of tuning on temporalspatial parameters was different between children with diplegia and those with hemiplegia. It was estimated that a sample size of 15 is required to detect significant changes at pÂ¼ 0. 05 and power of 0. 8. Conclusions. The findings of this study clearly indicate the potential clinical utility of tuning <b>using</b> <b>wedges</b> to correct knee hyperextension during the stance phase in children with cerebral palsy. However, observations support the need for an adequately powered study to assess the long-term effects of tuning on gait parameters, activity level and quality of life...|$|E

Finally a comparison among macroblock partition methods is performed, which points to the higher performance of the wedge partition method.

40|$|The {{ultrasonic}} {{control of}} steel welds {{is crucial in}} {{the oil and gas}} transportation industry. The state-of-the-art method is zonal focusing which consists in focusing the ultrasonic beam at specific distances using a wedge in order to check the integrity of specific zones in the weld. Advanced methods such as the total focusing method (TFM) give potentially better images in terms of signal to noise ratio and flaw resolution [1]. Moreover, a complete view of the weld is possible using TFM, contrary to zonal focusing. In this paper, we present a fast implementation of the TFM imaging for weld inspection <b>using</b> <b>wedges.</b> In particular, we propose a GPU implementation that tremendously accelerates the process and makes nearly real-time applications possible. The configuration with two media necessitates an optimization iterative procedure to estimate the proper times of flight, which is implemented in the GPU as well. We also present several skip modes in order to visualize different flaw orientations and locations in the weld (cap, root, etc.). First, we give imaging results on an aluminum block containing artificial flaws such as porosity or lack of fusion. We make a comparison between TFM and conventional imaging, and show that TFM gives better results in terms of image quality (SNR, resolution). Finally, we show results of a real girth weld inspection and demonstrate that the use of TFM is definitely interesting in this context...|$|E
