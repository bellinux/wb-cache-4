50|$|Ultrasound is also {{a common}} tool for {{determining}} viability. A lower than expected heart rate or missed development milestones may indicate {{a problem with the}} pregnancy. Diagnosis should not be made from a single ultrasound, however.

40|$|One factor which {{influences}} {{the performance of}} <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>examinations</b> is {{the condition of the}} surface of a component through which the ultrasound must pass to enter the material. Often in nuclear reactor components, factors such as weld overlays, claddings, and diametrical shrink can give part surfaces a wavy, corrugated, or abruptly stepped topography. Having to pass an ultrasonic probe over such a surface during an inspection can result in a redirection of beam energy, beam partitioning, or possibly a partial truncation of the beam. These factors could leave regions of the part uninspected or give rise to mislocation of defects or geometrical reflectors...|$|R
50|$|According to the European Committee of Medical Ultrasound Safety (ECMUS) <b>Ultrasonic</b> <b>examinations</b> {{should only}} be {{performed}} by competent personnel who are trained and updated in safety matters. Ultrasound produces heating, pressure changes and mechanical disturbances in tissue. Diagnostic levels of ultrasound can produce temperature rises that are hazardous to sensitive organs and the embryo/fetus. Biological effects of non-thermal origin {{have been reported in}} animals but, to date, no such effects have been demonstrated in humans, except when a microbubble contrast agent is present.Nonetheless, care should be taken to use low power settings and avoid pulsed wave scanning of the fetal brain unless specifically indicated in high risk pregnancies.|$|R

40|$|Atherosclerotic {{alterations}} of {{the internal}} carotid artery frequently result in ischemic stroke. However, it remains unclear which specific factor mainly causes {{an increased risk of}} stroke. Constant improvements of the diagnostic possibilities of <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>examinations</b> provide increasingly profound insight into plaque alterations. If "risk plaque" could be reliably identified, the therapeutic decision for either medical or surgical treatment could be made more rationally. In this review, we summarize current developments in the ultrasound imaging of atherosclerotic changes in carotid artery disease with special emphasis on technical aspects and the rationale of contrast imaging of plaque vascularization. Methodological limitations and possible future applications are discussed...|$|R
