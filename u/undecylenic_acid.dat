For tinea pedis, many antifungal creams such as miconazole nitrate, clotrimazole, tolnaftate (a synthetic thiocarbamate), terbinafine hydrochloride, butenafine hydrochloride and <b>undecylenic</b> <b>acid</b> are effective. For more severe or complicated infections, oral ketoconazole was historically shown {{to be an effective}} treatment for T. rubrum infections but is no longer used for this indication due to the risk of liver damage as a side effect. Oral terbinafine, itraconazole or fluconazole have all been shown to be safer, effective treatments. Terbinafine and naftifine (topical creams) have been successfully treated tinea cruris and tinea corporis caused by T. rubrum.

Topical application of an antifungal cream such as terbinafine once daily for one week or butenafine once daily for two weeks is effective in most cases of athlete's foot and is more effective than application of miconazole or clotrimazole. Plantar-type athlete's foot is more resistant to topical treatments due to the presence of thickened hyperkeratotic skin on the sole of the foot. Keratolytic and humectant medications such as urea, salicyclic acid (Whitfield's ointment), and lactic acid are useful adjunct medications and improve penetration of antifungal agents into the thickened skin.

40|$|The atomic force {{microscope}} (AFM) {{has fueled}} interest in nanotechnology because {{of its ability to}} image surfaces at the nanometer level and act as a molecular force sensor. Functionalization of the surface of an AFM tip surface in a stable, controlled manner expands the capabilities of the AFM and enables additional applications in the fields of single molecule force spectroscopy and nanolithography. Two AFM tip functionalizations are described: the assembly of tripodal molecular tips onto gold AFM tips and the photochemical attachment of terminal alkenes to nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) AFM tips. ^ Two separate tripodal molecules with different linker lengths and a monopodal molecule terminated with biotin were synthesized to attach to a gold AFM tip for single molecule force spectroscopy. The immobilization of these molecules was examined by contact angle measurements, spectroscopic ellipsometry, infrared, and near edge x-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy. All three molecules displayed rupture forces that agreed with previously reported values for the biotin–avidin rupture. The tripodal molecular tip displayed narrower distribution in their force histograms than the monopodal molecular tip. The performance of the tripodal molecular tip was compared to the monopodal molecular tip in single molecule force spectroscopy studies. Over repeated measurements, the distribution of forces for the monopodal molecular tip shifted to lower forces, whereas the distribution for the tripodal molecular tip remained constant throughout. Loading rate dependence and control experiments further indicated that the rupture forces of the tripod molecular tips were specific to the biotin–NeutrAvidin interaction. ^ The second functionalization method used the photochemical attachment of <b>undecylenic</b> <b>acid</b> to NCD AFM tips. The photochemical attachment of <b>undecylenic</b> <b>acid</b> to hydrogen-terminated NCD wafer surfaces was investigated by contact angle measurements, x-ray photoelectron, infrared, and NEXAFS spectroscopy.

Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) or transmission FTIR spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to characterize the monolayers and to follow the course of reactions with primary amines in aqueous solution. It {{was found that the}} reaction of the 3 -nitrophenyl undecylenate with the PSi surface resulted in significant oxidation of the surface. A control reaction with nitrobenzene confirmed that the arylnitro group was responsible for the surface oxidation and grafting of the nitroaromatic on the surface via a Si-O-N linkage. The N-succinimidyl (NHS) and thioethyl activated ester-modified surfaces formed monolayers with no apparent oxidation of the PSi surface. However, we find that the hydrophobic end groups prevent wetting of the porous structure and further reaction is not possible. Reactions of these groups could be achieved by the addition of 25 % (v/v) of ethanol to the aqueous solution of amine, electrochemical partial oxidation of the surface, or preparation of mixed monolayers consisting of mixtures of <b>undecylenic</b> <b>acid</b> and the activated undecylenate ester in a ratio of 5 : 1 or higher.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a DNA hybridisation biosensor relies greatly on the stability and selectivity of the sensing interface. This thesis explores several different DNA interface constructs on both gold and silicon surfaces {{for the development of}} an electrochemical impedance label-free DNA sensor. The gold sensing interface is comprised of a mixed self-assembled monolayer of single-stranded probe DNA and a diluent, mercaptoethanol. Using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, the recognition interface was shown to display a good ability to differentiate between different target DNA analytes. However, the surface chemistry was found to be chemically unstable, thus making the sensor unreliable. Silicon sensing interfaces were formed by attaching single-stranded probe DNA to <b>undecylenic</b> <b>acid</b> on p-type Si(111). This surface chemistry showed good selectivity towards complementary DNA but impedance measurements were found to suffer from interference attributed to oxide growth underneath the grafted <b>undecylenic</b> <b>acid</b> monolayer. A novel silicon interface was trialed by attaching alkyne-tagged single-stranded DNA onto a 1, 8 -nonadiyne modified p-type Si(111) surface via a one-pot tandem click reaction. With the addition of an antifouling layer comprised of bovine serum albumin, the recognition interface shows good discrimination between complementary, non-complementary and single-base mismatch target DNA using Faradaic impedance. This surface chemistry was translated onto poorly doped n-type Si(111) to investigate field-induced effects upon the formation of a DNA duplex. DNA hybridisation was found to result in a positive shift in open circuit potential (OCP). This was attributed to the increase in upward band bending due to the extra negative charge from the DNA at the silicon-electrolyte interface, bringing the silicon electrode further into depletion. OCP results were supported by a positive shift of the flat band potential obtained via AC impedance measurements...|$|E

Photolysis of the oxidized film in the tropospheric actinic region (ì> 295 nm) readily produces formaldehyde and formic acid as gas-phase products.
