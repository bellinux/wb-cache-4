In hospitalized SARS patients, the abnormalities tend to progress to bilateral air-space consolidation.

30|$|China’s {{engagement}} with global poverty reduction {{can best be}} seen from its involvement in multilateral coordination rather than through its <b>unilateral</b> <b>or</b> <b>bilateral</b> approach. Although <b>unilateral</b> <b>or</b> <b>bilateral</b> approach still forms {{an integral part of}} China’s effort to reduce global poverty, it is in many ways geared towards enhancing China’s national interests, at least seen by many aid recipients and aid donors. China’s multilateral approach in this area, however, shows China’s effort to become a concerned member of the aid community, taking collective action to deal with poverty and hunger worldwide. To examine China’s multilateral approach, this paper focuses on three major international organisations and the South-South Programme.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: {{to analyze}} the pattern of disocclusion during excursive mandibular {{movements}} and {{presence or absence of}} occlusal interferences and occlusal pathologies (gingival recession and abfraction). METHOD: examination of 120 individuals divided into two groups, as follows: Group 1 - 90 patients with complete cleft lip and palate (study group), subdivided into 30 patients with complete left unilateral cleft lip and palate, 30 patients with complete right unilateral cleft lip and palate and 30 patients with complete bilateral cleft lip and palate; Group 2 - 30 individuals without clefts (control group). RESULTS: 58. 8 % of patients in Group 1 presented <b>unilateral</b> <b>or</b> <b>bilateral</b> canine guidance, 26. 6 % presented <b>unilateral</b> <b>or</b> <b>bilateral</b> group function and 54. 4 % presented lateral movements through the posterior teeth. Regarding protrusive movements, 80 % presented anterior guidance and 20 % presented posterior guidance. In Group 2, 69. 6 % of individuals presented <b>unilateral</b> <b>or</b> <b>bilateral</b> canine guidance, 43. 2 % presented <b>unilateral</b> <b>or</b> <b>bilateral</b> group function and only 13. 3 % presented lateral movements through the posterior teeth; 3. 4 % presented protrusion through the posterior teeth. CONCLUSIONS: {{there was no difference in}} the pattern of disocclusion between subgroups of patients with clefts. Group 2 presented predominance of bilateral group function, whereas Group 1 presented a higher prevalence of posterior guidance during lateral movements. Protrusion occurred primarily through anterior guidance in Group 2 and through the posterior teeth in Group 1. There was high prevalence of occlusal interferences at the molar area for both groups, yet with no correlation with occlusal pathologies (recession and abfraction) ...|$|R
40|$|Impulse control {{disorders}} (ICDs) and dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS) {{are important}} behavioral problems that affect a subpopulation {{of patients with}} Parkinson's disease (PD) and typically result in markedly diminished {{quality of life for}} patients and their caregivers. We aimed to investigate the effects of subthalamic nucleus (STN) and internal globus pallidus (GPi) deep brain stimulation (DBS) on ICD/DDS frequency and dopaminergic medication usage. A retrospective chart review was performed on 159 individuals who underwent <b>unilateral</b> <b>or</b> <b>bilateral</b> PD DBS surgery in either STN or GPi. According to published criteria, pre- and post-operative records were reviewed to categorize patients both pre- and post-operatively as having ICD, DDS, both ICD and DDS, or neither ICD nor DDS. Group differences in patient demographics, clinical presentations, levodopa equivalent dose (LED), and change in diagnosis following unilateral/bilateral by brain target (STN or GPi DBS placement) were examined. 28 patients met diagnostic criteria for ICD or DDS pre- or post-operatively. ICD or DDS classification did not differ by GPi or STN target stimulation. There was no change in DDS diagnosis after <b>unilateral</b> <b>or</b> <b>bilateral</b> stimulation. For ICD, diagnosis resolved in 2 of 7 individuals after <b>unilateral</b> <b>or</b> <b>bilateral</b> DBS. Post-operative development of these syndromes was significant; 17 patients developed ICD diagnoses post-operatively with 2 patients with pre-operative ICD developing DDS post-operatively. <b>Unilateral</b> <b>or</b> <b>bilateral</b> DBS did not significantly treat DDS or ICD in our sample, even though a few cases of ICD resolved post-operatively.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} {{the effects of}} laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery performed over 3 consecutive years to treat adnexal disease and to report patient perioperative outcomes. DESIGN: Retrospective clinical study (Canadian Task Force classification III). SETTING: Tertiary care academic medical center. PATIENTS: Women undergoing LESS because of a benign gynecologic indication, from January 2009 through December 2011. INTERVENTIONS: Women with benign adnexal disease ≤ 10 cm underwent LESS surgery through a single 1. 5 - to 2. 0 -cm umbilical incision. Intraoperative and postoperative outcomes were carefully recorded, including the need for postoperative rescue analgesia. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: One hundred twenty-five patients were enrolled. Median patient age was 49 years, and median body mass index was 23. Surgical procedures included <b>unilateral</b> <b>or</b> <b>bilateral</b> salpingo-oophorectomy and <b>unilateral</b> <b>or</b> <b>bilateral</b> cyst enucleation. Median operative time was 48 minutes. Pain control was optimal, with an average visual analog score of 4 / 10. Both patients and surgeons were highly satisfied with the cosmetic result, and the cosmetic visual analog score was 9 / 10 at discharge and at 30 days after surgery. The {{number of women who}} underwent <b>unilateral</b> <b>or</b> <b>bilateral</b> salpingo-oophorectomy increased progressively and significantly yearly over the study period (16 vs 23 vs 40; p =. 001). Median operative time for <b>unilateral</b> <b>or</b> <b>bilateral</b> salpingo-oophorectomy increased significantly from 2009 to 2010 and 2011 (34 vs 45 and 44 minutes; p =. 001), together with median BMI (23 vs 23 vs 25; p =. 04). CONCLUSION: LESS is a desirable surgical approach in patients with simple adnexal disease...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe aim of {{this study}} was to review the chest CT {{findings}} at presentation and on follow-up in pregnant women with confirmed S-OIV. Materials and methodsWe reviewed the CT findings at presentation (n =  16) and after hospital admission (n =  10) of 18 pregnant women diagnosed with Influenza A (H 1 N 1) in our hospital between Nov 5, 2009 to Dec 12, 2009. CT manifestations were reviewed independently by 3 observers who reached a consensus decision. Chest CT findings were analyzed with regard to the patterns and distributions of pulmonary abnormalities. ResultsThe predominant CT findings at presentation consisted of <b>unilateral</b> (n =  6) <b>or</b> <b>bilateral</b> (n =  10) ground-glass opacities <b>or</b> focal <b>unilateral</b> (n =  3) <b>or</b> <b>bilateral</b> (n =  9) areas of consolidation. 4 of the 16 patients had associated mild thickening of the interlobular septa. The predominant follow-up abnormalities consisted of <b>unilateral</b> (n =  3) <b>or</b> <b>bilateral</b> (n =  7) ground-glass opacities <b>or</b> <b>unilateral</b> (n =  1) <b>or</b> <b>bilateral</b> (n =  1) consolidation. 8 of the 10 patients had interstitial opacity findings, including smooth thickening of the interlobular septa (n =  5), reticulation (n =  2) and honeycombing (n =  1). 3 patients had irregular lines (n =  3) and traction bronchiectasis (n =  1). ConclusionThe most common CT manifestations of pregnant women with confirmed S-OIV are <b>unilateral</b> <b>or</b> <b>bilateral</b> ground-glass opacities <b>or</b> focal <b>unilateral</b> <b>or</b> <b>bilateral</b> areas of consolidation. In pregnant women, the abnormalities seem to more extensive than general patients. Some pregnant women patients may develop interstitial opacity and traction bronchiectasis due to fibrosis...|$|R
