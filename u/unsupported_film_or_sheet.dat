However, the possibility of developing a protein based film by conventional processing technique typical of thermoplastic polymers could open a large range of applications, but it is quite challenging. In fact, the processing of proteins is difficult because of their tendency to degrade and crosslink at high temperature [2]. The addition during extrusion of proper crosslinking inhibitors, the plasticization and the blending with bio-related polyester is necessary to achieve a material still compostable but also processable with conventional industrial equipment [3 - 4]. However, although biopolyesters represent the best available option, the high polarity usually shown by proteins is not compatible with them, and coarse phase morphology and poor mechanical properties were often observed in these blends [5]. Hence the selection of proper compatibilizers consisting in small molecules or in modified proteins is quite important for achieving a better phase morphology, in terms of phase dimensions and adhesion, and properties modulation.

This study has produced precipitates having a composition of 2 Ni(OH) {sub 2 }{center_dot}Ni(HCO{sub 3 }) {sub 1. 85 }(NO{sub 3 }) {sub 0. 15 }. The XRD patterns showed peaks commonly observed for {alpha}-Ni(OH) {sub 2 }. The precipitates produced from low and high cation concentration solutions showed that the mean particle size and specific surface area increased with aging time. The high specific surface area measured suggested that the particle growth occurred through the aggregation of nanosized crystallites. The TEM micrographs confirmed that the particles were actually aggregates of thin <b>films</b> <b>or</b> <b>sheets</b> that were crumpled and intertwined together. This work also investigated the effect of dispersant on the particle morphology. The addition of dispersants did not alter the density of the particles implying that the dispersants were not incorporated into the solid phase. A general decrease in mean particle size at each aging time was observed resulting in an increase in specific surface area. The use of dispersants provided steric hindrance for the particles in the solution to aggregate, thus smaller particles were observed. Cyclic voltammetric tests were carried out to see if the high surface area Ni(OH) {sub 2 } produced in this work had superior performance characteristics compared to the commercial powders currently available. Indeed, the study showed that the homogeneously precipitated Ni(OH) {sub 2 } had higher coulombic efficiency and degree of reversibility than the commercial powders. The efficiency values of all the homogeneously precipitated powders were approximately 90 %. The same efficiency values observed were probably due to the same specific surface areas of the powders after aging in KOH solution...|$|R

At the lower speed and lower forward time, the hardness is approximately equal but a slightly difference in hardness. The hardness increases with an increase in reverse time at high speed of the pipe and higher forward time but there is a difference in hardness at lower forward time and higher forward time. The thin film is formed during machining between aluminum and zinc. The hardness of the internal surface of the pipe varies with the speed of the pipe at the constant forward time and reverse time. This happens due to lower speed and at higher forward and lower reverse time results higher friction leads to more deposition. The coating thickness is increases with an increase in forward time at low speed and low reverse time. The coating thickness is higher at higher forward time and lower reverse time due to more amount of zinc deposition due to more axial compressive forces.

Many processes in nature and technology depend on the motion and dynamic behavior of solids, liquids, and gases. Smart surface systems are essential because of the recent technological push toward higher speeds, loads, and operating temperatures; longer life; lighter weight and smaller size (including nanotechnology); and harsh environments in mechanical, mechatronic, and biomechanical systems. If proper attention is not given to surface systems, then vehicles, machines, instruments, and other technical systems could have short lives, consume excessive energy, experience breakdowns, result in liabilities, and fail to accomplish their missions. Surface systems strongly affect our national economy and our lifestyles. At the NASA Glenn Research Center, we believe that proper attention to surface systems, especially in education, research, and application, could lead to economic savings of between 1. 3 and 1. 6 {{percent of the gross}} domestic product. Wear coatings and surface systems continue to experience rapid growth as new coating and surface engineering technologies are discovered, more cost-effective coating and surface engineering solutions are developed, and marketers aggressively pursue, uncover, and exploit new applications for engineered surface systems in cutting tools and wear components. Wear coatings and smart surface systems have been used widely in industrial, consumer, automotive, aerospace, and biomedical applications. This presentation expresses the author's views of and insights into smart surface systems in wear coatings. A revolution is taking place in carbon science and technology. Diamond, an allotrope of carbon, joins graphite, fullerenes, and nanotubes as its major pure carbon structures. It has a unique combination of extreme properties: hardness and abrasion resistance; adhesion and friction; thermal conductivity; chemical and thermal inertness; corrosion and wear resistance; radiation resistance and biocompatibility; electronic, acoustic, and electrochemical characteristics; and environmental compatibility. These properties make diamond attractive {{for a wide range of}} diverse applications. In particular, chemical-vapor-deposited (CVD) diamond coatings offer a broad potential, since size and cost are not as limiting. The production of large, superhard diamond <b>films</b> <b>or</b> <b>sheets</b> at low cost make designer materials possible. This presentation is divided into two sections: properties and applications of hard coatings. The first section is concerned with the fundamental properties of the surfaces of CVD diamonds and related materials. The surface properties of hard coatings with favorable coefficients of friction (less than or equal to 0. 1) and dimensional wear coefficients (less than or equal to 10 (exp - 6) cubic millimeters/N. m) in specific environments are discussed. The second section is devoted to applications. Examples of actual, successful applications and of potential challenging applications of the coatings. such as CVD diamond, diamondlike carbon, and cubic boron nitride-are described. Cutting tools coated with CVD diamond are of immediate commercial interest. Other applications, such as microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), valves, and bearings of CVD diamond, are being developed, but at a slow pace. There is a continually growing interest in commercializing diamondlike carbon for wear parts applications, such as biomedical parts and implants, forming dies, transport guides, magnetic tapes and disks, valves, and gears.
