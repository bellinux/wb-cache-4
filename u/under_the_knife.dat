25|$|As Singaporean gynaecological {{surgeons}} {{became more}} skillful, {{leaders in the}} field like Prof. S Shan Ratnam were authorised to perform Sex reassignment surgery male-to-female (SRS) at Kandang Kerbau Hospital. The first such operation in Asia took place in Singapore in July 1971. However, before patients could go <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>knife,</b> they first had to subject themselves to an exhaustive battery of tests and be given a clean psychological bill of health by chief academic psychiatrist Prof. Tsoi Wing Foo.|$|E

However, before hopeful transsexuals-to-be could go <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>knife,</b> they {{first had to}} subject themselves to a battery of psychological tests by psychiatrist Prof. Tsoi Wing Foo. Later, the more technically demanding female-to-male variety was also offered there and at Alexandra Hospital, performed by gynaecologists such as Dr. Ilancheran. A Gender Identity Clinic and Gender Reassignment Surgery Clinic were set up at the National University Hospital two decades later. In fact, for thirty years, Singapore {{was one of the}} world leaders in gender-reassignment surgery. Bugis Street and Johore Road started to become populated with a range of genders from transvestites to iatrogenic intersex individuals to fully transformed women. Local hospitals and clinics also attracted transgender clients from other countries in the region, especially Malaysia and Thailand.|$|E

Titled, Louis Theroux: The Strange and The Dangerous, the DVD set received a four-out-of-four-star recommendation from The Daily Record. In February 2009, The Independent placed the DVD release as number eight among its list of [...] "The 50 Best DVD boxsets", and characterised The Most Hated Family in America as the [...] "strangest episode of the set, and by far the most disturbing". The documentary aired in Ireland on 10 February 2010 on 3e and was given a four-out-of-four star recommendation by The Mail on Sunday.|$|E
60|$|Now it {{was that}} I mentally thanked Sergeant Corney for having delayed so long before starting, for {{it would have been}} agony indeed had we been forced to witness the horrible {{spectacle}} of a white man suffering <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>knives</b> and by <b>the</b> fire of these wolves in human form.|$|R

2500|$|Other {{aspects of}} Blake's mythology also begin to emerge during the poem. For example, Damon {{argues that the}} death of the four unnamed daughters and the {{corruption}} of the fifth is Blake's first presentation of {{the death of the}} four senses and the corruption of touch, or sex; [...] "all imaginative activity based on the senses disappears except automatic sexual reproduction. Even this proves too much for his moral virtue." [...] As Damon elaborates, [...] "Hela's Medusan locks are the torturing thoughts of suppressed lust." [...] The corruption of the senses plays an important role throughout Europe a Prophecy ("the five senses whelm'd/In deluge o'er the earth-born man"), The Book of Urizen ("The senses inwards rush'd shrinking,/Beneath the dark net of infection"), The Song of Los ("Thus the terrible race of Los & Enitharmon gave/Laws & Religions to the sons of Har binding them more/And more to Earth: closing and restraining:/Till a Philosophy of Five Senses was complete"), The Four Zoas ("Beyond the bounds of their own self their senses cannot penetrate") and Jerusalem ("As the Senses of Men shrink together <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Knife</b> of flint").|$|E

60|$|Man after man of {{the little}} group of National Guards, who had been {{gathered}} talking {{in front of the}} door of the prison, was seen to detach himself from it and to move quietly away. Then those at the windows noticed four or five parties of men move forward, from among those who were standing talking; when within a short distance of the guard there was a sharp command, and these groups all rushed towards the gates together. There were shouts and cries, and then there was silence. Taken wholly by surprise, the guard had fallen <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>knives</b> of <b>the</b> Vendeans without having had time to fire a shot.|$|R

50|$|In 1723 he and Charaba Lotro Gyalpo were {{appointed}} regular {{members of the}} cabinet, which from now on consisted of five members. The basic principle of this new administrative structure of Tibet was, {{that the members of}} the cabinet acted as ruling princes over <b>the</b> regions standing <b>under</b> them (Ü, Kongpo, Tsang, and Ngari), having their particular military resources and means of income. This certainly weakened the position of Tibet vis-à-vis its neighbours, but also raised the danger of inner dissent, if the leading politicians could not agree. In fact there was great disharmony between the cabinet members from the start. The tension eventually exploded in 1727 when Khangchenné died <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>knives</b> of his peers. Polhané was luckily absent from Lhasa at the time, since his wife was ill and he had hastened to her sickbed at his estate.|$|R

At the worst his boy had but one chance in five of death or serious injury, but for a time he {{could think of nothing}} but that one chance.

60|$|The {{council of}} war clanked {{off to see}} if Mr. Wardrop's words were true.

The Haliotis lifted to the long, easy swell, and the starboard supporting-column ground a trifle, as a man grits his teeth <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>knife.</b> The forward cylinder was depending on that unknown force men call the pertinacity of materials, which now and then balances that other heartbreaking power, the perversity of inanimate things.|$|E

60|$|Yet these dark {{passages}} {{of human life}} may be only necessary elements of the complex education of our race; and as much mercy under a fearful shape, as ours when we put the child we love <b>under</b> <b>the</b> surgeon's <b>knife.</b> At least we may believe so; {{believe that they have}} a moral end, though that end be unseen by us; and without any rash or narrow prying into final causes (a trick as fatal to historic research as Bacon said it was to science), we may justify God by faith, where we cannot justify Him by experience.|$|R

60|$|I {{remember}} the scene impelled me to sudden laughter, {{and in the}} next instant I realized I was becoming hysterical myself; for these were women of my own kind, like my mother and sisters, with the fear of death upon them and unwilling to die. And I remember that the sounds they made reminded me of the squealing of pigs <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>knife</b> of the butcher, and I was struck with horror at the vividness of the analogy. These women, capable of the most sublime emotions, of the tenderest sympathies, were open-mouthed and screaming. They wanted to live, they were helpless, like rats in a trap, and they screamed.|$|E
60|$|The inn of Passignano promised {{little from}} its outward appearance; a tall, dark old house, with a stone {{staircase}} leading us up from one sombre story to another, into a brick-paved dining-room, with our sleeping-chambers on each side. There was a fireplace of tremendous depth and height, fit to receive big forest-logs, {{and with a}} queer, double pair of ancient andirons, capable of sustaining them; and {{in a handful of}} ashes lay a small stick of olive-wood,--a specimen, I suppose, of the sort of fuel which had made the chimney black, {{in the course of a}} good many years. There must have been much shivering and misery of cold around this fireplace. However, we needed no fire now, and there was promise of good cheer in the spectacle of a man cleaning some lake-fish for our dinner, while the poor things flounced and wriggled <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>knife.</b>|$|E

You thought I meant to deceive you about it all--that I ought to have spoken before I married you: yet, had you listened, I would have told you that up to the very morning on which St. Cyr went to the guillotine, I was straining every nerve, using every influence I possessed, to save him and his family. But my pride sealed my lips, when your love seemed to perish, as if <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>knife</b> of that same guillotine. Yet I would have told you how I was duped! Aye!

60|$|Out of {{the eight}} men who had fallen in the action, only three still breathed--that one of the pirates who had been shot at the loophole, Hunter, and Captain Smollett; and of these the first two were as good as dead; the mutineer, indeed, died <b>under</b> <b>the</b> doctor's <b>knife,</b> and Hunter, do what we could, never {{recovered}} consciousness in this world.

Foley agrees to send American troops to help defeat the rebels, in exchange for help exposing Brooks' machinations. Foley then arranges for an assault team to break into Silver Bullet Systems to rescue Sylvia, who has {{been sent to the}} operating theatre to be transformed into a Voracian after being caught trying to escape; Foley's troops break her out almost literally from <b>under</b> <b>the</b> operating <b>knives.</b>|$|R
60|$|There {{are several}} forms of mutiny, {{and some of}} them are called by other names, but all as {{dangerous}} as they are wicked.

6000|$|There is {{a legend}} about the natural {{philosophy}} class-room, the period long antecedent to Tait. The professor, annoyed by a habit students had got into of leaving their hats on his desk, {{announced that the}} next hat placed there would be cut in pieces by him in presence of the class. The warning had its effect, until one day when the professor was called {{for a few minutes}} from the room. An undergraduate, to whom the natural sciences, unrelieved, were a monotonous study, slipped into the ante-room, from which he emerged with the professor's hat. This he placed on the desk, and then stole in a panic to his seat. An awe fell upon the class. The professor returned, but when he saw the hat he stopped. He showed no anger. [...] "Gentlemen," [...] he said, [...] "I told you what would happen if you again disobeyed my orders." [...] Quite blandly he took a pen-knife from his pocket, slit the hat into several pieces, and flung them into the sink. While the hat was <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>knife,</b> the students forgot to demonstrate; but as it splashed into the sink, they gave forth a true British cheer. The end.|$|E
6000|$|Commerce and Manufacture praise {{on every}} hand in their not mute but inarticulate way {{the glories of}} science. Poetry does not play its part. Behold John Keats, skilful with the surgeon's knife; but when he writes poetry his {{inspiration}} is not from the operating table. Here I am reminded, though, of a modern instance to the contrary in prose. Mr. H. G. Wells, who, as far as I know, has never written a line of verse, was inspired {{a few years ago}} to write a short story, <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Knife.</b> Out of a clock-dial, a brass rod, and a whiff of chloroform, he has conjured for us a sensation of space and eternity, evoked the face of the Unknowable, and an awesome, august voice, like the voice of the Judgment Day; a great voice, perhaps the voice of science itself, uttering the words: [...] "There shall be no more pain!" [...] I advise you to look up that story, so human and so intimate, because Mr. Wells, the writer of prose whose amazing inventiveness we all know, remains a poet even in his most perverse moments of scorn for things as they are. His poetic imagination is sometimes even greater than his inventiveness, I am not afraid to say. But, indeed, imaginative faculty would make any man a poet--were he born without tongue for speech and without hands to seize his fancy and fasten her down to a wretched piece of paper.|$|E
6000|$|The latter {{had taken}} arms and drawn up in battle array, gazing with astonishment at this fight between white men, but without taking part on either side. When {{the battle was}} over, they {{approached}} the field, gazing upon the dead bodies of the beings they had once fancied immortal. They were curious in examining the wounds made by the Christian weapons. Among the wounded insurgents was Pedro Ledesma, the same pilot who so bravely swam ashore at Veragua, to procure tidings of the colony. He {{was a man of}} prodigious muscular force and a hoarse deep voice. As the Indians, who thought him dead, were inspecting the wounds with which he was literally covered, he suddenly uttered an ejaculation in his tremendous voice, at the sound of which the savages fled in dismay. This man, having fallen into a cleft or ravine, was not discovered by the white men until the dawning of the following day, having remained all that time without a drop of water. The number and severity of the wounds he is said to have received would seem incredible, but they are mentioned by Fernando Columbus, who was an eye-witness, and by Las Casas, who had the account from Ledesma himself. For want of proper remedies, his wounds were treated in the roughest manner, yet, through the aid of a vigorous constitution, he completely recovered. Las Casas conversed with him several years afterwards at Seville, when he obtained from him various particulars concerning this voyage of Columbus. Some few days after this conversation, however, he heard that Ledesma had fallen <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>knife</b> of an assassin. [202] ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Under</b> <b>the</b> Switchblade <b>Knife</b> Act of 1958 (amended 1986, codified at 15 U.S.C. §§1241-1245), switchblades and {{ballistic}} knives {{are banned}} from interstate shipment, sale, or importation, or possession within the following: any territory or {{possession of the}} United States, i.e. land belonging to the U.S. federal government; Indian lands (as defined in section 1151 of title 18); and areas within the maritime or territorial jurisdiction of the federal government, {{with the exception of}} federal, state law enforcement agencies and the military.
