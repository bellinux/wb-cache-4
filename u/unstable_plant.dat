40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of direct {{closed-loop}} identification for <b>unstable</b> <b>plant</b> models disturbed by stochastic noise. The <b>unstable</b> <b>plant</b> is stabilized by a digital feedback controller. Then by introducing the output inter-sampling scheme, the plant model is identified from the inter-sampled input-output data of the plant even though the external reference or the test signal does not hold persistently exciting property. Both time and frequency domain approaches are developed and numerical examples are performed to demonstrate the e#ectiveness of the proposed approaches. 1 Introduction It is hardly to perform the identification experiment of <b>unstable</b> <b>plant</b> model in the open loop situation; consequently some closed-loop identification methods have been developed to identify the <b>unstable</b> <b>plant</b> model from closed-loop data.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the infimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) required for stabilisation of a linear time invariant (LTI) scalar <b>unstable</b> <b>plant</b> over a class of additive coloured Gaussian noise channels. We apply recent results in the literature to obtain the feedback capacity of such a class of channels. We prove that the infimal SNR constrained LTI solution, when dealing with a scalar <b>unstable</b> <b>plant,</b> does achieve a channel feedback capacity equal to the infimal rate of transmission required for stability. The optimality of such channel feedback capacity is a non trivial result since we consider additive 1 st order moving average (MA) and autoregressive moving average (ARMA) coloured noise...|$|E

40|$|This paper uses gap metric {{analysis}} to derive robustness and performance margins for feedback linearizing controllers. Distinct from previous robustness analysis, it incorporates {{the case of}} output unstructured uncertainties, and is shown to yield general stability conditions which {{can be applied to}} both stable and unstable plants. It then expands on existing feedback linearizing control schemes by introducing a more general robust feedback linearizing control design which classifies the system nonlinearity into stable and unstable components and cancels only the <b>unstable</b> <b>plant</b> nonlinearities. This is done in order to preserve the stabilizing action of the inherently stabilizing nonlinearities. Robustness and performance margins are derived for this control scheme, and are expressed in terms of bounds on the plant nonlinearities and the accuracy of the cancellation of the <b>unstable</b> <b>plant</b> nonlinearity by the controller. Case studies then confirm reduced conservatism compared with standard methods...|$|E
40|$|A reformation is {{provided}} of the graph topology {{and the gap}} topology for a general setting (including lumped linear time-invariant systems and distributed linear time-invariant systems) in the frequency domain. Some essential properties and their comparisons are clearly presented in the reformulation. It is shown that the gap topology is suitable for general systems rather than square systems with unity feedback. It is shown that whenever an <b>unstable</b> <b>plant</b> can be stabilized by feedback, it is a closed operator, mapping a subspace of the input space to the output space. Hence, the gap topology can always be applied whenever the <b>unstable</b> <b>plant</b> can be stabilized. The graph topology and the gap topology are suitable for different subsets of systems and have many similar characteristics. If one confines them to the same subset, they will be identical. The definitions of the graph metric and the gap metric are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{problem of}} {{stabilizing}} an <b>unstable</b> <b>plant</b> over a noisy communication link is {{an increasingly important}} one that arises in problems of distributed control and networked control systems. Although the work of Schulman and Sahai {{over the past two}} decades, and their development of the notions of “tree codes” and “anytime capacity”, provides the theoretical framework for studying such problems, there has been scant practical progress in this area because explicit constructions of tree codes with efficient encoding and decoding did not exist. To stabilize an <b>unstable</b> <b>plant</b> driven by bounded noise over a noisy channel one needs real-time encoding and real-time decoding and a reliability which increases exponentially with delay, which is what tree codes guarantee. We prove the existence of linear tree codes with high probability and, for erasure channels, give an explicit construction with an expected encoding and decoding complexity that is constant per time instant. We give sufficient conditions on the rate and reliability required of the tree codes to stabilize vector plants and argue that they are asymptotically tight. This work takes a major step towards controlling plants over noisy channels, and we demonstrate the efficacy of the method through several examples. I...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- In this paper, {{the problem}} of {{stabilizing}} an open-loop unstable second-order system with time delay is considered. A constant feedback gain is utilized to stabilize the system. Using {{a modified version of}} Hermite-Biehler Theorem, which is applicable to quasi-polynomials- the complete set of stabilizing constant feedback gains for open-loop <b>unstable</b> <b>plants,</b> is determined. The desired closed-loop performance, e. g., overshoot, settling time, rise time, etc. can be achieved by proper selection of the gain within the boundaries of obtained set of stabilizing gains. The results reported here will serve as a stepping stone for tackling the more complicated case of analytic control and stabilization of second order systems with time delay, using a PI or a PID controller. The proposed procedure is studied on a numerical example.

40|$|An {{important}} {{statement in}} Quantitative Feedback Theory(QFT) {{is that the}} nominal plant can be chosen arbitrarily {{whether or not it}} is a member of the plant set. Based on this statement, a design method for non-minimum phase and <b>unstable</b> <b>plants</b> proposed by Horowitz is to choose the stable minimum phase plant as the nominal plant.

In the previous study, on the actuation side, both distributed (SIAM J. Optim. Control 1997; 35 : 678 – 713; IEEE Trans. Autom. Control 2000; 45 : 203 – 216) and boundary (IEEE Trans. Autom. Control 2000; 45 : 203 – 216) actuations were considered in the open loop, whereas for the closed loop (<b>unstable</b> <b>plants)</b> only distributed one was addressed. On the sensing side, only distributed sensing was considered. The present study goes beyond the identification framework of (SIAM J. Optim. Control 1997; 35 : 678 – 713; IEEE Trans. Autom.
