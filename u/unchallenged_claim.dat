40|$|This {{article is}} based on a {{national}} report that was written for the XVth World Congress of the International Association of Procedural Law that was held in Istanbul in May 2015 and that focused on Effective Judicial Relief and Remedies in an Age of Austerity. It first of all sketches the general judicial context in Belgium and some of its relevant features: the judicial organisation, the goals of the civil justice system, the course of an ordinary civil lawsuit, the role of the court, and the litigation costs. Next, a detailed and critical overview of the current and future procedures that offer relief in small and simple matters is given. The current summary order for payment procedure, which was introduced in 1967, did not meet its goals. The article concludes that a new trend is emerging in Belgium, namely keeping small and <b>unchallenged</b> <b>claims</b> outside the judiciary and providing for cheaper and more efficient alternatives...|$|R

Secondly, Lozi mythology gives legitimacy to the Lozi kingdom's foundations, by linking the monarchy and the people to a creator god, whom the Lozi call Nyambe.|$|R
5000|$|Justice Clarence Thomas, on June 13, 2013, {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the Court, in which all other members of the Supreme Court joined, except Justice Antonin Scalia, who concurred in part and concurred in the judgment. The majority opinion delivered by Thomas held, [...] "A naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature and not patent eligible merely because it has been isolated, but cDNA is patent eligible because it is not naturally occurring." [...] In Part III of the majority opinion, Thomas wrote:It is important to note what is not implicated by this decision. First, there are no method claims before this Court. Had Myriad created an innovative method of manipulating genes while searching for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, it could possibly have sought a method patent. But the processes used by Myriad to isolate DNA at the time of Myriad's patents [...] "were well understood, widely used, and fairly uniform insofar as any scientist engaged in the search for a gene would likely have utilized a similar approach," [...] 702 F. Supp. 2d, at 202-203, and are not at issue in this case.Similarly, this case does not involve patents on new applications of knowledge about the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Judge Bryson aptly noted that, [...] "as the first party with knowledge of the and BRCA2 sequences, Myriad was in an excellent position to claim applications of that knowledge. Many of its <b>unchallenged</b> <b>claims</b> are limited to such applications." [...] 689 F. 3d, at 1349.Nor do we consider the patentability of DNA in which the order of the naturally occurring nucleotides has been altered. Scientific alteration of the genetic code presents a different inquiry, and we express no opinion about the application of §101 to such endeavors. We merely hold that genes and the information they encode are not patent eligible under §101 simply because they have been isolated from the surrounding genetic material.In his concurring opinion, which relates to the scientific details in the majority opinion, Scalia wrote:I join the judgment of the Court, and all of its opinion except Part I-A and some portions {{of the rest of the}} opinion going into fine details of molecular biology.  I am unable to affirm those details on my own knowledge or even my own belief.  It suffices for me to affirm, having studied the opinions below and the expert briefs presented here, that the portion of DNA isolated from its natural state sought to be patented is identical to that portion of the DNA in its natural state; and that complementary DNA (cDNA) is a synthetic creation not normally present in nature.|$|R
40|$|Scholarship on {{homophobia}} {{has been}} critiqued for being individualistic and psychological, failing {{to account for}} structural inequalities, experiences of homophobia and discursive manifestations of homophobia. This Economic and Social Research Council funded study attempts {{to address some of}} these concerns by focusing on the experiences of lesbians, gay men and bisexuals (LGBs) in relation to bullying, harassment and discrimination in the British workplace. We examine what homophobia is understood to be and how psychological and organisational discourses make it difficult to make sense of negative experiences and how anti-homosexual attitudes and work environments are sustained and left <b>unchallenged</b> through the <b>claim</b> ‘it’s not personal’. Drawing on theories of selective incivility and modern discrimination, we illustrate how ambiguous anti-homosexual sentiments are, and argue that the term ‘homophobia’ not only prevents people from challenging negative experiences, but it further masks inequalities based on sexuality at work...|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of its opening in November 1980, in a {{converted}} building that had housed the Olympia bowling alley, it was <b>unchallenged</b> in its <b>claim</b> as the biggest bookstore in the world. Although it retained the name, the Guinness Book of World Records listed the Barnes & Noble College Booksellers location on Fifth Avenue in New York City as the largest bookstore in the world based on floor space, although Powell's Books of Portland, Oregon, is usually considered the largest based on shelf-space. Nevertheless, World's Biggest Bookstore claimed the title on the basis that it carried more titles, while Barnes & Noble had more floor space. The Barnes & Noble location closed in early 2014. On December 22, 2010, Maruzen and Junkodou Shoten opened a 73 000 square foot (6804 m²) bookstore in the Umeda district of Osaka, Japan, overtaking these other three in terms of floor space.|$|R
5000|$|Egyptian {{opposition}} politicians hailed Khatir as [...] "hero of Sinai" [...] for {{committing the}} massacre of Israelis. The glorification of Khatir as a national hero in the Egyptian opposition press was echoed in other Arab countries, and mass demonstrations were held in his support. Attempting to justify his actions, the press did not report that {{all but one of}} the victims were women or children, but instead invented miscellaneous pretexts for the shootings. The press claimed that the Israeli tourists were spies caught photographing secret military installations, that they spat upon and tore up an Egyptian flag, that half-naked Israeli women offended Khatir's Muslim conscience, or that the tourists attacked him. The pro-governmental press remained silent regarding the facts of the massacre, leaving the <b>claims</b> <b>unchallenged.</b> Many Egyptian intellectuals and religious leaders joined in extolling Khatir and his act. Umar al-Tilimsani, the leader of Muslim Brotherhood, said that [...] "if every Muslim would do what Sulayman did, Israel would no longer exist". Farid Abd al-Karim, one of the leaders of the Arab Socialist Party, called Khatir [...] "the conscience of this nation", whose bullets [...] "washed away the shame" [...] of the Camp David Peace Accords between Israel and Egypt. Ahmad Nasir of the Egyptian Bar Association claimed that history would always honor Khatir as [...] "a living model of a noble Egyptian who refused to be led astray by the treaties of betrayal and surrender".|$|R
