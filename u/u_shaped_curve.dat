With the onset of monsoon, throughout the monsoon the curve form rising limb and once the monsoon retrieve the curve starts forming recession limb, which continue until the next monsoon (annual cycle). Successive annual cycles join together to form long-term hydrograph. With the full knowledge of fluctuation of groundwater level, the hydraulic conductivity/filtration conditions can be calculated by analyzing recession curve of well hydrograph (Ferdowsian et al. 2001; Gailuma and Vitola 2009; Posavec et al. 2006; Sujono et al. 2004). The rapid decline in recession curve corresponds to better filtration conditions (Gailuma and Vitola 2009). Therefore, it can be stated comparatively that the <b>U</b> <b>shape</b> <b>curves</b> correspond to better hydraulic conductivity (k) than the V shape, whereas the S <b>shape</b> <b>curves</b> represents the lowest hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer.

40|$|Total caloric {{restriction}} (CR) without malnutrition is a well-established experimental approach to extend life span in laboratory animals. Although CR in humans {{is capable of}} shifting several endocrinological parameters {{it is not clear}} where the minimum inflection point of the <b>U</b> <b>shaped</b> <b>curve</b> linking body mass index (BMI) with all-cause mortality lies. The exact trend of this curve, when used for planning preventive strategies for public health is of extreme importance. Normal BMI ranges from 18. 5 to 24. 9; many epidemiological studies show an inverse relationship between mortality and BMI inside the normal BMI range. Other studies show that the lowest mortality in the entire range of BMI is obtained in the overweight range (25 to 29. 9). Reconciling the extension of life span in laboratory animals by experimental CR with the BMI-mortality curve of human epidemiology is not trivial. In fact, one interpretation is that the CR data are identifying a known: excess fat is deleterious for health; although a second interpretation may be that: additional leanness from a normal body weight may add health and life span delaying the process of aging. This short review hope to start a discussion aimed at finding the widest consensus on which weight range should be consider the healthiest for our species, contributing in this way to the picture of what is the correct life style for a long and healthy life span...|$|E

This study examined whether RRs for deliberate self harm (DSH) in ethnic groups vary between small areas according to their ethnic mix.  DESIGN—Small area study of DSH rates in ethnic groups, by local ethnic density, using negative binomial regression.  SETTING— 73 south London electoral wards, 1994 - 1997.  SUBJECTS— 1643 people attending casualty after DSH.  MAIN RESULTS—African-Caribbean and Asian DSH rates, relative to the white population, varied between wards. A linear model indicated a decline by factors (relative rate ratios) 0. 76  (95 % confidence intervals (CI) 0. 64  to 0. 90) and 0. 59  (95 % CI 0. 36  to 0. 97) respectively per SD increase in the local size of these minority populations.

DESIGN [...] Prospective population study with baseline assessment of alcohol and tobacco consumption and body mass index, and 10 - 12 years' follow up of mortality. SETTING [...] Copenhagen city heart study, Denmark. SUBJECTS [...] 7234 women and 6051 men aged 30 - 79 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE [...] Number and time of deaths from 1976 to 1988. RESULTS [...] A total of 2229 people died, 1398 being men. A <b>U</b> <b>shaped</b> <b>curve</b> described the relation between alcohol intake and mortality. The lowest risk was observed at one to six alcoholic beverages a week (relative risk set at 1). Abstainers had a relative risk of 1. 37 (95 % confidence interval 1. 20 to 1. 56) whereas those drinking more than 70 beverages a week had a relative risk of 2. 29 (1. 75 to 3. 00). Among the drinkers, the risk was significantly increased only among those drinking more than 42 beverages a week. Sex, age, body mass index, and smoking did not significantly modify the risk function. The risk among heavy drinkers was slightly reduced when smoking was controlled for. The risk function was similar in the first and second period of six years of observation.

There are several contrasting views that have emerged related to the size of the board and its effect on performance. One set of researchers’ state that larger board size will have diverse skill and knowledge which in turn will have a positive impact on the performance of the firm. The other group of researchers state that a larger board size will have a negative effect on performance due to reasons like lack of coordination, slow decision making process and free rider issues. The third group states that the relationship between the size of the board and the performance of the firm is in form of an inverted <b>U</b> <b>shaped</b> <b>curve.</b> While some other researchers find low significance or no link between the board size and the performance of the firm.

This {{might be due}} to the fact that most of the glioma patients are using imatinib for shorter periods than would be typical in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia.

Hormesis- the <b>U</b> <b>shaped</b> [or inverted <b>U</b> <b>shaped</b> curve] dose–response <b>curve</b> is not rare where increasing dose after a given point can decrease total cytotoxicity, as with ciprofloxacin in vitro (Hincal et al. 2003).

Additionally, in independent experiments we have compared the effects of ethanol in mice with or without a pre-treatment with the aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor cyanamide, which produces acetaldehyde accumulation.

40|$|This thesis explores some of {{the social}} factors that may affect {{individuals}} as they age. A lifespan developmental perspective is employed in investigating the effects of societal aging stereotypes on will-to-live and risk-taking skills. Results suggest negative aging stereotypes may have deleterious effects on the elderly, but not young individuals in terms of will-to-live, but {{have no effect on}} risk-taking abilities. Furthermore, a cross-cultural analysis of Americans and Japanese reveals robust differences in self-concept between countries, which in turn partially mediate the effects of culture and age on control strategies. It appears culture and age may play important roles in determining individuals' self-concept, motivation, and regulation of behavior. The first part of Study 1 examined whether stereotypes of aging contribute to decisions the elderly make about when to die. Elderly and young participants (n = 64) were subliminally primed with either negative or positive stereotypes of old age using a computer, and then responded to hypothetical medical situations involving potentially fatal illnesses. Consistent with my prediction, the aged participants primed with negative stereotypes tended to refuse life-prolonging interventions, whereas those primed with positive age stereotypes tended to accept the interventions. This priming effect did not emerge among the young participants for whom the stereotypes were less relevant. The results suggest that socially transmitted negative stereotypes of aging can weaken elderly will-to-live, or at the very least, willingness to pursue medical intervention. The second part of Study 1 examined whether the older adults demonstrate similar risk-taking skills to the younger adults, and whether this ability is preserved, even after exposure to age stereotypes. Sixteen young and 16 older participants were tested on a risk-taking decision task following exposure to subliminal aging stereotypes. In all conditions, both the old and young participants systematically and equivalently increased their willingness to take risks as risk level decreased. Furthermore, response times were an inverted <b>U</b> <b>shape</b> <b>curve</b> with slower response times recorded at the medium risk level and faster times as risk levels shifted up or down. The findings suggest the ability to make decisions based on risk level is maintained into old age. Study 2 investigated results reported by a number of studies finding that primary control remains stable in old age, is lower in Asian countries, and that secondary control increases in old age and is higher in Asian countries. I examined whether these patterns {{may be due to the}} mediating influence of an interdependent self-concept. In a sample of 557 young and older adults in Japan and the United States, primary and secondary control, age, and interdependence were studied. I found that interdependence partially mediated the influence of culture on secondary control and interdependence partially mediated the influence of age on both primary and secondary control.

Secondly, based on the FE software DEFORM- 3 D, the rigid-plastic finite element model of the cross wedge rolling of spiral shaft parts was established, and the rolling process was simulated. The forming qualities in both cases of having <b>shaping</b> <b>curve</b> and no <b>shaping</b> <b>curve</b> were compared, from which we can find that the forming quality of having <b>shaping</b> <b>curve</b> is better, it also shows that the <b>shaping</b> <b>curve</b> is correct, and the process of cross wedge rolling of spiral shaft is feasible...|$|R
50|$|An oxbow lake is a <b>U</b> <b>shaped</b> body {{of water}} that forms when a wide meander from the main stem of a river is cut off, {{creating}} a free-standing {{body of water}}. This landform is so named for its distinctive <b>curved</b> <b>shape,</b> resembling the bow pin of an oxbow. In Australia, an oxbow lake {{is known as a}} billabong, from the indigenous language Wiradjuri. In south Texas, oxbows left by the Rio Grande are called resacas.|$|R
40|$|We model {{an agency}} {{relationship}} {{in which the}} agent's cost is non-monotonic with respect to type and the type is correlated with a public ex-post signal. The principal can use lotteries to exploit the type-signal correlation within the limit of the agent's liability. We establish conditions for first-best implementation, highlighting two effects on contractual design. First, {{the structure of the}} optimal lottery varies across types and, for each type, it depends on whether the cost is <b>U</b> <b>shaped</b> or reverse <b>U</b> <b>shaped</b> with respect to type. Second, as compared to the case of monotonic cost, the design of incentive compatible lotteries is easier when the cost is <b>U</b> <b>shaped,</b> more difficult when the cost is reverse <b>U</b> <b>shaped.</b> The root of the second effect is that incentives are non-monotonic either below or above some interior types. The two effects involve that non-monotonicity is unfavorable to the principal when the cost is reverse <b>U</b> <b>shaped.</b> This conclusion is at odds with the wisdom, concerning settings without correlated information, that non-monotonicity, which triggers countervailing incentives, enhances contracting...|$|R
