International community recognizes the legitimacy of power relying on voting results as a decision of citizens. Problem of power legitimacy in case of falsification of the election results is hidden information about it. Often there is no documentary proofs considered that results are falsified. Authorities have too much impact on recognition of legitimacy and citizens often don't have possibility to prove illegitimacy. If legitimacy is regarded as equivalent to legality, then its other characteristics are dismissed. In this paper the legitimacy and the legality are divided.

For claims of <b>unfair</b> practices, the <b>conduct</b> standard under section 75 - 1. 1 is open-ended {{to the point of}} dysfunction.

Early decisions under section 75 - 1. 1 said expressly that courts should take guidance from the law under section 5. The courts need only follow that advice.

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the South African law {{relating}} to promotions. As promotion disputes mostly arise as alleged unfair labour practices, a short discussion on how {{the concept of an}} unfair labour practice developed in South Africa is undertaken. In this regard the common law is studied in order to see whether it makes provision for protection of employees subjected to unfair labour practices relating to promotions. Through this study one soon realises that the common law is in fact inadequate to deal with unfair labour practices relating to promotions, and thus an enquiry into various legislative provisions are undertaken. The impact of the all-important Wiehahn Commission of Enquiry, established in 1979, is also briefly discussed. In this article an attempt is made to define the term ‘promotion’. In this regard reference is made to some cases adjudicated upon by the Commission for Conciliation Mediation and Arbitration (the “CCMA”). The cases referred to seem to favour the view that when one is defining the term ‘promotion’, regard must be had to the employment relationship between the employer and the employee, as well as the nature of the employee’s current work in relation to the work applied for, in order to establish whether in fact a promotion has taken place. It is necessary to consider what <b>unfair</b> <b>conduct</b> is defined as in the context of promotions. It seems that managerial prerogative {{is at the center of}} the enquiry into <b>unfair</b> <b>conduct</b> of the employer. Further to the analysis of <b>unfair</b> <b>conduct,</b> various principles that govern both procedural and substantive unfairness are considered. These principles are dealt with separately with reference to case law. Lastly the dispute resolution mechanisms are considered and a brief discussion on remedies is undertaken. The remedies are discussed with reference to case law, as well as the provisions of the Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995 as amended by the Labour Relations Amendment Act 12 of 2002. The broad headings of this article are accordingly unfair labour practices, definition of promotions, <b>unfair</b> <b>conduct</b> of the employer, onus of proof and remedies. It is concluded with the proposition that once an employer has set policies and procedures in place in dealing with promotions, then such an employer should stick to those policies and procedures within the context of the law, as well as within the percepts of the vague and nebulous term of ‘fairness’. Should the employer fail to do so, the majority of cases indicate that such an employer will be guilty of an unfair labour practice relating to promotion...|$|E

This legal instrument seeks to establish a common European understanding of “unfairness” in business-to-consumer legal relations.

Implementing act among other rules introduced into the national legal system provisions on the prohibition of misleading commercial practices, ensuring that consumers are not misled, thus enabling them to make informed and reasonable choices. The purpose of this article is to examine the norms of national act, implementing the prohibition of misleading commercial practices into the national legal system in the context of implementing provisions of the other Member States and to reveal core national regulation and application problems. Also, having in mind that in the text of the Directive a distinction between misleading actions and misleading omissions is made, it is analyzed whether the clear line between the application of these rules is made in legal practice.

As was stated in reference to section 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), the modern equivalent of which is section 18 of the Australian Consumer Law: 49. Irrespective of the construction of these two special conditions it does not matter ultimately whether the impugned conduct with which this case is concerned falls literally within them or not. Section 52 is a section in the consumer protection provisions of an Act concerned to protect the public from misleading or deceptive <b>conduct</b> and <b>unfair</b> trade practices which may result in contravention of the Act. It has been held that exclusion clauses, of which special conditions 6 and 7 are examples, cannot operate to defeat claims under s. 52.

This article has as starting point {{on the one hand}} the need for legal provisions ensuring a real protection to the Romanian consumers exposed to unfair trade practices, {{and on the other hand}} of some comprehensive legal stipulations on tradesmen’s contravention and criminal liability that show an <b>unfair</b> competitive <b>conduct.</b> The general regulatory framework regarding the unfair competition consists of the Law no. 11 / 1991 on combating the unfair competition, the legal stipulations which relate to the European provisions on the matter, namely the Directive 2005 / 29 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council from May 11 th 2005 concerning unfair commercial practices of enterprises in the internal market to consumers and amending the Directive 84 / 450 /EEC of the Council, of the Directives 97 / 7 /EC, 98 / 27 /EC and 2002 / 65 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) no. 2006 / 2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council. The European legislation includes the stipulations regarding the unfair commercial practices prohibited in the E. U. space, as well as the stipulations relating to the economic interests of consumers who enter into transactions with tradesmen. In this respect, the European regulations deem unfair trade practices those acts or actions that violate the principles of professional diligence and which may influence the commercial decisions of consumers, being categorized as misleading practices and aggressive commercial practices. In accordance with the provisions of the Law no. 11 / 1991 on combating the unfair competition, with the ulterior amendments and supplements, unfair competition represents the commercial practices of the enterprise that contravenes the fair usages and the general principle of good faith and which cause or may cause damage to any market participants. According to art. 301 of the old Criminal Code, the unfair competition consists in the manufacture or circulation of goods bearing a false designation of origin or false indications of origin and application on the products put in circulation of false mentions regarding the patents or the use of certain commercial names or of the denominations of industrial or trade organizations, in order to mislead the beneficiaries.
