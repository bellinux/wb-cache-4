5|$|The Confederate ironclad Tennessee {{attacked}} Farragut's wooden ships {{without much}} effect {{after they had}} passed the Confederate forts and she was engaged by Winnebago before she disengaged and briefly took shelter under Fort Morgan's guns. About a half-hour later, the ironclad attacked Farragut's ships again. The monitors were not initially engaged, but Chickasaw managed to assume a position by the Tennessees stern and fired repeatedly at point-blank range. Her shots failed to penetrate the Tennessees armor, but they did jam the armored shutter for the stern gun port and cut her exposed steering chains, rendering her unable to steer. When the crew attempted to <b>unjam</b> the shutter, one shell struck {{the edge of the}} shutter, creating fragments that killed the machinist attempting to knock out the shutter's retaining pin and broke Admiral Franklin Buchanan's leg. This damage, together with damage inflicted by the other Union ships, persuaded Commander James D. Johnston to surrender his ship. The two monitors remained in Mobile Bay and subsequently bombarded Fort Morgan and Fort Gaines until they surrendered less than three weeks later.|$|E

This crowding of the constituent particles prevents them from exploring phase space, making the aggregate material behave as a solid.

40|$|The {{canonical}} {{models for}} studying the <b>unjamming</b> scenario in systems of soft repulsive particles assume pairwise potentials with a sharp cut-off in the interaction range. The sharp cut-off renders the potential non-analytic, but {{makes it possible to}} describe many properties of the solid in terms of the coordination number $z$, which has an unambiguous definition in these cases. Pairwise potentials without a sharp cut-off in the interaction range have not been considered in this context, but are of interest for understanding the relevance of the <b>unjamming</b> phenomenology to systems in which such a cut-off cannot be assumed. In this work we explore two systems with such interactions: an inverse power law and an exponentially decaying pairwise potential, with the control parameters being the exponent (of the inverse power-law) for the former and the number density for the latter. Both systems are shown to exhibit the characteristic features of the <b>unjamming</b> transition, among which are the vanishing of the shear to bulk modulus ratio and the emergence of an excess of low-frequency vibrational modes. We establish a relation between the hydrostatic pressure to bulk modulus ratio and the distance to <b>unjamming</b> in each of our model systems. This allows us to predict the dependence of other key observables on the distance to <b>unjamming.</b> Our results provide the means for a quantitative estimation of the proximity of generic glass forming models to the <b>unjamming</b> transition {{in the absence of a}} clear-cut definition of the coordination number, and highlight the general irrelevance of nonaffine contributions to the bulk modulus.

40|$|We {{show that}} the flow of {{granular}} material inside a 2 -dimensional flat bottomed hopper is altered significantly by having more than one exit orifice.

Using discrete element simulations, we {{show that the}} total amount of granular material (i. e. avalanche size) emanating from all the orifices combined can be enhanced by about an order of magnitude difference by simply adjusting the inter-orifice distance.

We show that internal variables, e. g., stress and fabric of the pile, exhibit hysteresis during these cycles due to the exploration of different metastable configurations. Interestingly, the hysteretic behaviour of the pile strongly depends on the maximal inclination of the cycles, giving evidence of the irreversible modifications of the pile state occurring close to the <b>unjamming</b> transition. More specifically, we show that for cycles with maximal inclination larger than the repose angle, the weak contact network carries the memory of the <b>unjamming</b> transition.

This length scale is related to isostaticity, and has been connected earlier to the existence of soft modes in isostatic packings.

Optical microscopy and image analysis {{were used to}} track tracer particles mixed into dispersions of sterically stabilized poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) spheres. The dispersions were drawn into a round [0. 5]mm capillary at one of two pump speeds (≡ applied pressure) : v_ 1 =[0. 245]ml min^- 1 and v_ 2 =[0. 612]ml min^- 1. We observed that the dispersions at particle volume fractions ϕ≤ 0. 50 followed Hagen-Poiseuille flow for a simple fluid; i. e. the mean flow rate 〈 V〉 is approximately proportional to pressure drop (pump speed) and inversely proportional viscosity η. Above this concentration (ϕ≥ 0. 505), the dispersions exhibit granular-like jamming behavior with 〈 V〉 becoming independent of the pressure drop. However, at the highest applied pressure (v_ 2), the dispersions are able to <b>unjam</b> and switch from granular-like behaviour back to a simple hard-sphere liquid like system, due {{to the formation of}} rotating vortices in the spatial flow pattern.

We record the penetration depth of the displacements and the critical force that is needed to make the system yield. These quantities are tested in two types of systems: in ideal homogeneous packings in zero gravity and in packings settled under gravity. The penetration depth and the critical force are sensitive to the interparticle friction coefficient. Qualitatively, the same nonmonotonic friction dependence is found both with and without gravity, however the location of the extrema are at different friction values.

40|$|Aqueous and brine {{suspensions}} of {{corn starch}} show striking discontinuous shear thickening. We {{have found that}} a suspension shear-thickened throughout may remain in the jammed thickened state as the strain rate is reduced, but an <b>unjamming</b> front may propagate from any <b>unjammed</b> regions. Transient shear thickening is observed at strain rates below the thickening threshold, and above it the stress fluctuates. The jammed shear-thickened state may persist to low strain rates, with stresses resembling sliding friction and effective viscosity inversely proportional to the strain rate. At the thickening threshold fluid pressure depins the suspension's contact lines on solid boundaries so that it slides, shears, dilates and jams. In oil suspensions lubrication and complete wetting of confining surfaces eliminate contact line forces and prevent jamming and shear thickening, as does addition of immiscible liquid surfactant to brine suspensions. Starch suspensions in glycerin-water solutions, viscous but incompletely wetting, have intermediate properties. Comment: 13 pp., 5 figure...|$|R
