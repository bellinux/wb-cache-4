For the ceremony, sailors from HMCS Saguenay provided the guard of honour. Also present were The Royal Canadian Horse Artillery Band, French army engineers, and French-Moroccan cavalry who had fought on the site during the Second Battle of Artois. The ceremony itself was broadcast live by the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission over shortwave radio, with facilities of the British Broadcasting Corporation transmitting the ceremony to Canada. Senior Canadian, British, and European officials, including French President Albert Lebrun, and a crowd of over 50,000 attended the event. Absent, though, was Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, it being well <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was generally not comfortable around veterans and felt it more appropriate for a war veteran in Cabinet to act as minister in attendance.|$|E

5000|$|The song {{received}} a favorable review from Thom Jurek of Allmusic, {{who wrote that}} [...] "as the power chords and mandolin entwine around his reaching vocals and cascading acoustic guitar, we come to <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> can <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> can sing this way because he's been one of these children." ...|$|R

25|$|Paul {{says that}} when he entered medical {{practice}} in the early 1960s, before the Medicare and Medicaid programs were established, the poor and the elderly were hospitalized at about the same rates as they have been under Medicare and Medicaid in the 2000s, and that they received good care. He says further that in those days, doctors and hospitals provided cut-rate or free care to people who did not have health insurance – “every physician <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> or she had a responsibility toward the less fortunate, and free medical care for the poor was the norm” – and that this was possible because healthcare costs were much lower. At a church charity hospital where he worked in his early years of practice, “nobody was turned away” for lack of ability to pay.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{accomplish}} this heavy tasks, Görgei went again to Királyrév to hurry its occupation. He saw here {{that the cause of}} the lack of success of his troops is, that many of the soldiers and even some officers, instead of fighting, hid themselves in the corn-field near by. He disciplined them, than sent them to join the attack, and finally, {{with the help of the}} artillery, they managed to take Királyrév, and to start the crossing of the bridge from Aszódpuszta. After this Görgei sent order to Leiningen to Zsigárd that the III. corps immediately to start the advancement. But in the meanwhile the II. corps was forced by Austrian and Russian troops to retreat from Pered to Királyrév, and the news coming from Leiningen weren't good either, the III. corps got around from right by a strong enemy column, so he had to order the retreat from Zsigárd towards Farkasd. Hearing these news, Görgei <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had lost the right banks of the Vág river and with this the battle.|$|E
25|$|After {{the battle}} fatigue started {{affecting}} the King Porus, he {{slowly began to}} retire. Throughout the battle, Alexander {{is said to have}} observed with growing admiration, the valor of King Porus and <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> intended to be killed in combat. Hoping {{to save the life of}} this competent leader and warrior, Alexander commanded Taxiles to summon Porus for surrender. However, Porus turned indignant on the very sight of his nemesis and tossed a spear at him in furor without listening to his proposal forcing him to take flight on his steed. In such manner many other messengers, dispatched by the determined Alexander were spurned, till at last Meroes, a personal friend of Porus convinced him to listen to the message of Alexander. Overpowered by thirst, the weary Porus finally dismounted his War-Elephant and demanded water. After being refreshed, he allowed himself to be taken to Alexander. On hearing that the Indian King was approaching, Alexander himself rode out to meet him and the famous surrender meeting took place.|$|E

25|$|Nahum Gelber {{reports a}} story how Maggid Kluger {{attempted}} to leave Brody having accepted {{the invitation of}} Berezhany community and by an unlucky providence was forced to return to Brody. In 1843, Rabbi Kluger left his community in Brody and accepted the invitation of the community Berezhany community who, in 1845, elected him the supreme judicial authority. Despite the pleas of the Brody community leaders, the Magid left Brody and moved to Berezhany. In the winter of 1845, a delegation from Brody arrived in Berezhany and took him back to their town. In Berezhany he was received with great honor, especially by Rabbi Arie Leibush Natanson, father of the Lvov Rabbi, Rabbi Joseph Saul Nathanson, who {{had served as a}} Rain Berezhany prior to his appointment as a Rabbi in Lvov. A few days after his first sermon in Berezhany, the Magid caught typhus. He was sick for many years, and through this <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should not had left Brody. He vowed to leave Berezhany and return to Brody {{as soon as he got}} better, and no pleading on behalf of Berezhany messengers changed his mind. He resided in Brody as a private person, refraining from intruding into the activities of Brody's new Teacher of Justice. His admirers, and especially Rabbi Joseph Natanson, supported him for the rest of his life.|$|E
25|$|Masséna had {{accomplished}} his mission {{and had no}} further orders to continue his action but, hearing the intense cannonade on his right, he <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> needed to continue his attack. He detailed Boudet's division to march on Kagran, while his other three infantry divisions marched on Leopoldau. The corps cavalry preceded the infantry and Lasalle's squadrons caught up with Klenau's infantry near Leopoldau. There, the French cavalry met two Austrian battalions, already formed in solid masses. This formation was ideal for fending off enemy horse. Nevertheless, the French charged impetuously but achieved little. The first mass could only be dispersed after horse artillery came into action. Not long before 17:00, the cavalry moved against the second mass and {{it was during this}} action that the gallant Lasalle, one of the best cavalry commanders of his time, was shot dead. Marulaz took overall command of the cavalry and personally placed himself {{at the head of the}} 8th Hussars, in a bid to avenge the slain commander; the attempt failed and Marulaz was himself wounded and had to be carried away to the rear. This event, as well as the fact that the French were now under fire from the artillery of Austrian V Korps on Bisamberg heights, convinced Masséna to halt his pursuit. Towards 17:00 Klenau had succeeded in extracting his corps from the dangerous position next to the Danube and moved to relative safety behind the reserve V Korps, deployed on the Bisamberg heights.|$|E
500|$|The {{researchers}} found that 73% of 4- and 5-year-olds in their study understood that Mr. Hooper was dead and that 88% of this group <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was not coming back, although only about one-fourth of the 3-year-old viewers responded correctly. [...] Most of the 4- and 5-year-olds understood that Big Bird and the adults were sad. [...] Most children (80%) were attentive during the episode. [...] The parents interviewed had [...] "overwhelmingly positive" [...] reactions to the show, and that half {{reported that they had}} discussed death with their children after viewing it. [...] None of the parents reported negative reactions from their children, either immediately after watching the episode or at a later time.|$|E

500|$|Some historians {{contend that}} Fletcher's fuel {{situation}} {{was not at}} all critical but that Fletcher used it to justify his withdrawal from the battle area. [...] Fletcher's biographer notes that Fletcher concluded that the landing was a success and that no important targets for close air support were at hand. [...] Being concerned over the loss of 21 of his carrier fighters, he assessed that his carriers were threatened by torpedo-bomber strikes, and, wanting to refuel before Japanese naval forces arrived, withdrew as he had previously forewarned Turner and Vandegrift. Turner, however, believed that Fletcher <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was to provide air cover until all the transports were unloaded on August 9.|$|E
500|$|Takanohana and {{his brother}} made their {{professional}} debuts together in March 1988, with future rival Akebono also beginning {{his career in the}} same month. The two brothers had to move from the family quarters in the stable and join the communal room with all the other new recruits. They were also instructed not to refer to their parents as [...] "father" [...] and [...] "mother" [...] any more but as [...] "oyakata" [...] and [...] "okamisan" [...] (coach and coach's wife). Kōji initially wrestled under the name Takahanada, and it was <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would only be allowed to adopt his father's shikona of Takanohana (meaning noble flower) when he reached the champion ōzeki rank.|$|E
500|$|DeVeber was {{acclaimed}} to the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories in the 1898 election, and re-elected in the 1902 election. [...] Though {{he was a}} Liberal, he wholeheartedly {{supported the}} efforts of Premier Frederick W. A. G. Haultain to conduct territory politics along non-partisan lines. [...] As the federal government prepared to create two new provinces, Alberta and Saskatchewan, out of the Northwest Territoes, DeVeber joined with Haultain in advocating the continuation of this non-partisan approach into {{the governments of the}} new provinces. [...] This position put him at odds with the Liberal federal government, led by Wilfrid Laurier, who wanted the new provinces' governments to be Liberal. [...] A Liberal, George Bulyea, was therefore appointed Lieutenant Governor of Alberta, [...] and it was <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would appoint a Liberal as the province's first premier.|$|E

500|$|Burge {{pleaded not}} guilty and was {{released}} on $250,000 bond. [...] Fitzgerald noted that although Burge was being charged with lying, and not the torture to which {{the statute of limitations}} applied, he believed Burge to be guilty of both. [...] In the October 21 press conference, Fitzgerald stated that Burge had [...] "lied and impeded court proceedings" [...] during his 2003 written testimony. In the indictment, the prosecution stated that Burge <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a participant in and was aware of [...] "such events involving the abuse or torture of people in custody". [...] The trial was set for May 11, 2009. [...] Instead, on April 29, Burge filed a change-of-venue motion, in relation to the lawsuit filed by former Death Row inmate Madison Hobley, and Burge's trial was set for October 29, 2009.|$|E
500|$|The {{memorial}} {{was designed}} by Toronto architect and sculptor Walter Seymour Allward, who {{described it as a}} [...] "sermon against the futility of war". The memorial took eleven years and cost $1.5million ($ million in present terms) to build. The unveiling was conducted on 26 July 1936, by King Edward VIII accompanied by President Albert Lebrun of France and a crowd of over 50,000 people, including at least 6,200 Canadian veterans and their families. The Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King was absent, it being well <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was generally not comfortable around veterans and felt it more appropriate for a war veteran in Cabinet to act as minister in attendance. Edward VIII thanked France, in both English and French, for its generosity and assured those assembled that Canada would never forget its war missing and dead.|$|E
500|$|In {{an unconstitutional}} though {{widespread}} practice during the Communist witchhunts, the U.S. State Department refused to renew Rossen's passport. This, and {{his inability to}} find work, brought Rossen, like his friend, ex-Communist Elia Kazan, back to the committee in May 1953, where he named 57 people as Communists. [...] He explained to the committee why he chose to testify: [...] "I don't think, {{after two years of}} thinking, that any one individual can indulge himself in the luxury of personal morality or pit it against what I feel today very strongly is the security and safety of this nation." [...] Stephen Rossen later shed light on his father's decision: [...] "It killed him not to work. He was torn between his desire to work and his desire not to talk, and he didn't know what to do. What I think he wanted to know was, what would I think of him if he talked? He didn't say it in that way, though. Then he explained to me the politics of it—how the studios were in on it, and there was never any chance of his working. He was under pressure, he was sick, his diabetes was bad, and he was drinking. By this time I <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had refused to talk before and had done his time, from my point of view. What could any kid say at that point? You say, 'I love you and I'm behind you.'" ...|$|E
