50|$|It is an {{aromatic}} perennial herb {{producing a}} branching stem which may exceed a meter tall. The plentiful green leaves have blades up to 20 centimeters long which {{are divided into}} three leaflets (trifoliate), which are toothed or lobed. The blade is borne on a long petiole. The inflorescence is a compound umbel of many tiny white flowers {{at the tip of}} a stemlike peduncle. There are 4-10 florets on each <b>umbellule</b> with the central florets only possessing anthers. The narrow, elongated fruit is ribbed and bristly, measuring up to 2.5 centimeters long.|$|E
5000|$|Plants in {{the genus}} Silaum have umbels which are {{characteristic}} of plants in the Apiaceae family (they are umbelliferous, [...] "umbel-bearing"); the umbels in Silaus species tend to lack bracts. Silaus species also {{tend to have a}} few <b>umbellules</b> (secondary umbels of compound umbels), and these <b>umbellules</b> have several small bracts called bractlets. Remains of dead leaves can often be found {{at the base of the}} plant; plants in Silaum are richly branched.|$|R
50|$|Sherff {{separated}} Munroidendron from Tetraplasandra on {{the basis}} of five characters: the absence of <b>umbellules,</b> the arrangement of the flowers in a raceme, the sunken, diamond-shaped pedicel scars, the long, persistence of the subtending floral bracts, and the insertion of the stamens in only one whorl, even when numerous. It has been shown that, in spite of its appearance, the inflorescence is not truly a raceme because it is determinate.|$|R
5000|$|Individuals of {{this species}} are {{herbaceous}} and are rhizomatic. The aromatic, clustered roots are dark brown and often have node scarring. The rhizome portion which grows as a horizontal stem underground gives rise to new roots, and also shoots which eventually produce stems and then flowers. [...] The leaves are ternate-3-pinnate with calyx teeth and petioles about 5-12 cm long. The shoots can have anywhere from 3-6 linear bracts about 1-3 cm long. The flowers are located in crowded, <b>umbellules.</b>|$|R
5000|$|An umbel is an {{inflorescence}} {{which consists}} {{of a number of}} short flower stalks (called pedicels) which spread from a common point, somewhat like umbrella ribs. The word was coined in botany in the 1590s, from Latin umbella [...] "parasol, sunshade." [...] The arrangement can vary from being flat topped to almost spherical. Umbels can be simple or compound. The secondary umbels of compound umbels are known as umbellules or umbellets. A small umbel is called an <b>umbellule.</b> The arrangement of the inflorescence in umbels is referred to as umbellate, or occasionally subumbellate (almost umbellate).|$|E
50|$|The {{shape and}} size of the leaves depends on the {{environment}} in which S. suave grows. Basil rosette leaves form on moist ground at around 3.8 cm long, and in shallow water they grow in clusters of aquatic leaves. Once leaves are formed this flowering plant stands up to 3 meters tall with stems that are 5 cm in diameter. Water parsnip has light green and glabrous stems with longitudinal veins and few branches. Leaves along the stems are alternate and odd-pinnate. Water parsnip flowers are perfect (both male and female) and are self fertile. The pedicles are 3-5 mm long and the fruit is ovoid. The fruit is dry but does not split open when ripe. The flowers have <b>umbellule</b> inflorescence with 10-20 white flowers. These white flowers are small (~3.2 mm across) with 5 petals. The petals can sometimes be of unequal size and are somewhat heart shaped.|$|E
50|$|Like {{other members}} of the genus, the {{inflorescence}} of Thapsia villosa is a compound subhemispherical to globose umbel. It has 9 to 29 spokes and is about 6 to 12 cm in diameter. Bracts are usually absent, though in rare cases, one to three may be present, each around 6 to 40 mm in length and lanceolate in shape. The umbellules are hemispherical to globose. Bracteoles are also usually absent, though rarely 1 or 2 may be present. Each <b>umbellule</b> has about 18 to 43 flowers, each with five bright yellow elliptical petals. The fruits are oblong and around 9 to 15 mm long and 6 to 11 mm wide. When mature, they are light to dark brown in color with four yellowish to brownish wings characteristic of the genus. The main umbel has hermaphroditic flowers, containing both stamen and pistil. Smaller umbels may develop from the sides of the stem which usually contains only stamens. These umbels wither away quickly.|$|E
50|$|Leaflets obovate-oblong to oblong-cuneate, thinly coriaceous, {{coarsely}} serrate-dentate. Flowers usually unisexual; inflorescences are compound umbels with 8-20 primary branchlets up to 10 cm long, 15-20 secondary rays, <b>umbellules</b> with 10-15 {{flowers in}} each. Calyx truncate or obscurely 5-toothed; flowers 5mm in diameter, sweet-scented; petals 5, white to pink flushed, ovate to triangular, acute; stamens 5; ovary 2-loculed, each containing 1(-2) ovules; style branches 2, spreading.

40|$|In this research, {{morphology}} and {{anatomy of}} male flower structure in Pycnocycla nodiflora Decne. ex Boiss. belonging to family Apiaceae were studied [...] Application of some {{characteristics such as}} inflorescence, umbel florets and fruits in the classification of members of this family have {{paved the way for}} studies focusing on the flower structure. Morphological and cytohistological studies were performed by stereo- and light-microscopy using fixation and sectioning. Some morphological specificities of flower in this species included compound umbel inflorescences composed of 3 - 5 umbellules, involucre with 5 short and triangular bracts, 7 flowers in an <b>umbellule,</b> swollen peduncle in male flowers, heteromorphous sepals, color combination of white and purple of petals. Ttrichoms were abundantly observed on most flower parts. Anthers were dorsifix and structures with wrinkled edges were seen in the middle of male flower receptacles. Anatomical studies demonstrated the presence of secretory ducts with shizogenous development in sepal and petal structures. Hair formation on the epidermis of these structures was increased during maturation. Middle layer was transient and tapetum was of secretory type. Simultaneous cytokinesis produced tetrahederal tetrads. Anther dehiscence was longitudinal and released pollen grains were dumbbell shape. Some anthers in flower as well as some pollen sacs in an anther developed insimultaneously...|$|E

Ten populations, collected from different regions, were evaluated in a completely randomised design with eight to ten replications. Various agronomical and morphological characteristics were measured, including stem diameter, plant height, number of branches, number of leaves and leaflets, number of umbels, number of umbellules per inflorescence, number of flowers per <b>umbellule</b> with inflorescence, leaf length, average internodal distance, shoot dry matter, one hundred seed weight, number of seeds, biological production, single plant yield, length of ripening period and harvest index. Among the characteristics studied, a high coefficient of variation was observed {{for the number of}} seeds (197. 58), single plant yield (57. 56) and shoot dry matter (56. 28). Broad-sense heritability for all of the characteristics studied was moderate to high, and varied from 0. 41 to 91 % {{with the exception of the}} number of branches, length and ripening period, which had low broad-sense heritability.

40|$|The Daucus guttatus complex {{includes}} {{two to four}} species growing from central and northern Italy to the Middle East. They are characterized by being typically annuals up to 50 cm high; with primary umbels up to 7 cm in diameter with fewer than 25 (35) rays; discolored umbels frequent, bearing one to several dark colored <b>umbellules</b> which form different color patterns; and mericarps relatively small, ca. 2. 0 ‐ 4. 5 mm. The taxonomy of this complicated group has not been satisfactorily resolved to date and {{is the focus of}} current research. Seven names of species belonging to the D. guttatus complex occurring in the central and eastern Mediterranean basin are typified here: Daucus guttatus, Daucus bicolor, Daucus involucratus, Daucus setulosus, Daucus broteri, Daucus hirsutus, and Daucus speciosus. Historical data are reported to justify lectotype and/or epitype selection, and selected morphological and distributional data are used to facilitate identification. The resulting typifications will enable proper naming of clades identified in the accompanying integrated molecular and morphological study, clarifying the taxonomy of the Daucus guttatus complex...|$|R
40|$|Harmsiopanax {{is a small}} {{structurally}} isolated genus {{confined to}} the Malesian Archipelago. The three species here recognized are uniform both in their vegetative and their reproductive features. It has long been recognized {{that some of the}} characters of this genus are anomalous within the Araliaceae and a return to its earlier position within the Umbelliferae would have something in its favour. The monocarpic habit is unknown elsewhere in the Araliaceae, but is not uncommon in the Umbelliferae. The character of the fruit, which splits into two dry mericarps, closely approaches the fruit of the Umbelliferae, and the vascularization of the gynoecium (Philipson, 1970) is also characteristic of that family. However, the structure of the leaf-base, the tree stature, and the shape of the petals all incline towards the Araliaceae. This genus and a few other genera from the south-east Pacific region confirm the close relationship between these two families. The earliest known of the three species ranges through Java and the Sunda Islands to Timor and also northwards into Celebes. This species, H. aculeatus, is rather uniform in its characters. Within the Island of New Guinea the forms of the genus are more complex. A species of low to moderate altitudes (sea level to 1800 m) was described early in this century as H. harmsii. This species is confined to {{the eastern part of the}} island. It differs from H. aculeatus in several respects, particularly in leaf-shape and in the spherical <b>umbellules</b> borne on a distinct peduncle...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFerula jaeschkeana Vatke is an {{important}} threatened medicinal plant of the Himalayan region. The present study was carried out to determine {{the impact of the}} habitat variability and altitudinal gradient on the morphological and reproductive features of the species under study. The species exhibited great variability in its morphological traits under different environmental conditions. The plants were more vigorous and taller at a low altitude site, Kashmir University Botanical Garden (KUBG) while the plants of a high altitude site, Gulmarg were shorter. With increased altitude, a significant {{reduction in the number of}} umbels per flowering stem, umbellules per umbel and flowers per <b>umbellule</b> occurred. An increase in the number of stigma and anthers was also observed in some plants at higher altitudes. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that the habitat of KUBG and Dachigam proved relatively better for the growth of F. jaeschkeana. Maximum resources were allocated to the growth and development of the stem followed by root tubers, leaves and inflorescence. Reproductive success of the plant species varied along the altitudinal gradient and ranged from 64 % to 72 %. Increasing altitude resulted in a decrease in the allocation of biomass to reproductive structures in the form of decreasing dry weight. The total resource budget per plant was maximum in low altitude Drang (572. 6 ± 158. 36 g) and Dachigam (568. 4 ± 133. 42 g) populations and was least in the Gulmarg population (333. 4 ± 82. 89 g). The reproductive effort was higher (50. 83 %) for the high altitude Gulmarg population. The regression analysis revealed a positive correlation and predicts that plant height has a direct impact on the umbel diameter and leaf length. Our results present a detailed account on the variation of growth characteristics, reproductive success and changes in allocation patterns in relation to the environmental conditions of this valuable medicinal plant species. This information is very useful to introduce the species into cultivation and developing strategies for conservation and sustainable use of the wild populations...|$|E
