Similar issues arise when discussing the requirement of <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> negotiation at a precontractual stage.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the concept of}} <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> {{as one of the}} most controversial concepts in the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). While some CISG scholars argue that the role of <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> is limited to the interpretation of the CISG, others view <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> in the CISG as a general principle which governs the conduct of the contracting parties. This thesis argues that the nature of the concept, its implicit manifestations in the CISG and the understanding of the transnational case law prove that there are good reasons to consider a broader approach of <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> in the CISG. The thesis tries to explore the concept of <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> by critically analysing its connection with other contractual rules, the implication of applying <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> in contractual agreement and its role in national legal systems and international legal instruments. Following the <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> insight, the author explores the vague structure of Article 7 CISG which caused an element of confusion over the role of <b>good</b> <b>faith.</b> The authentic texts and the draft history of Article 7 critically analysed to show that a wider application of <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> in the CISG is possible. In addition, the general role of <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> is enhanced by classifying and elaborating some of the functions of <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> as it is implicitly manifest in the CISG. A list of CISG transnational cases which referred to the concept of <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> are critically reviewed to establish that the actual jurisprudence is going to adopt <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> as a general principle in the CISG. The conclusion raises important issues related to the need to adopt a general role for <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> and methods to improve our understanding of <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> in the CISG...|$|R
2500|$|Only {{in special}} {{categories}} of contract such as partnership or insurance contracts {{is there a}} duty of <b>utmost</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> (or uberrimae fidei) by which both sides are meant to disclose to each other all material information. For example, in Lambert v Co-operative Insurance Society Ltd the Co-op was entitled to rescind their insurance policy with Ms Lambert and not pay up on stolen jewellery because she had failed to disclose {{that her husband had}} been convicted for theft. By contrast, in ordinary contractual situations, there is no such duty. As Chitty J opined, ...|$|E
2500|$|In a {{specific}} set of contracts, negotiating parties must conduct themselves in <b>utmost</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> (or [...] "uberrima fides") by disclosing all material facts to one another. In one of the earliest cases, Carter v Boehm, Mr Carter bought an insurance policy for any losses to a naval fort of the British East India Company in Sumatra, but failed to tell his insurer, Boehm, that the fort was only built to resist attacks from locals, and the French were likely to invade. Lord Mansfield held the policy was invalid. Since insurance is a contract based on speculation and the special facts [...] "lie most commonly in the knowledge of the insured only", good faith precluded Mr Carter [...] "concealing what he privately knows". The same policy was extended for sale of shares in a company. So in Erlanger v New Sombrero Phosphate Co the promoter and director-to-be of a guano mining business failed to disclose he had paid for the mining rights on the island of Sombrero half as much as he subsequently was valuing the company at. The House of Lords held that, despite a delay in making a claim, the purchasers of the shares had a right to their money back. Lord Blackburn held, further, that it was no barrier to rescission that the guano could not be put back in the ground. Counter-restitution (i.e. both parties giving back what they had got), if it could be substantially made in its monetary equivalent, was enough. However, outside insurance, partnerships, surety, fiduciary relations, company shares, a narrow range of regulated securities, and consumer credit agreements, the duty on negotiating parties to disclose material facts does not extend to most contracts. Even though there is a duty to correct previous false statements, in Smith v Hughes, it was held that the general duty is merely to not make active misrepresentations.|$|E

It explores the limitations of the Fair Work Act’s compliance-based approach to <b>good</b> <b>faith,</b> which consists mainly of the parties presenting a legally defensible appearance of not acting in bad faith. In contrast, the New Zealand legislation aims to suffuse <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> with considerable content and definition, enabling parties to the employment relationship to extend <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> well beyond bargaining. In contrast to the Employment Relations Act, the formalistic, procedural approach promoted by the Fair Work Act is unlikely to encourage a significant cultural change towards meaningful <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> principles and practices...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{international and}} supranational rules on <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> {{in the context}} of restitution of cultural property. Deviations from the general rules on <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> with regard to the <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> acquisition and adverse possession have been indicated. Instead of insuring acquisition of ownership in conjunction with other preconditions, <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> only entitles an acquirer of the stolen or illegally exported cultural object to a fair compensation. The <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> presumption was abandoned and the burden of proof was imposed on the possessor of the cultural object. At the same time the criteria upon which the <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> ought to be evaluated had been tightened. Concerning gratuitous legal transactions, <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> of a transferee depends on <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> of a transferor. For that reason, a transferee will be prevented from claiming a fair compensation if {{it would not have been}} awarded to his transferor. Ultimately, the paper explores in which legal sources and in what manner certain EU Member States have implemented <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> stipulations enshrined in Directive 2014 / 60 /EU. Based on that, the paper suggests possibilities of harmonising law of the Republic of Serbia with the outlined supranational rules...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> cannot be defined and {{furthermore}} {{that there is}} no need to define <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> as it takes on meaning when applied to facts. Hence an explanation or application of <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> is defined by its function namely to enforce the expected performance of both parties. It is further argued that the function of <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> will determine which fact pattern has to be found by a court in order to determine the expected performance of the contractual parties. It follows that <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> is the legal concept which allows courts to do justice and do it according to law. As <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> takes on meaning only when applied to contractual terms, Peden is correct to argue that “... the widespread use of ‘good faith’ in legislation is... completely unhelpful in the development of contractual <b>good</b> <b>faith.</b> ” An interesting way to juxtaposition this point transnationally is to look at international and US theories of <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> in the light of the development of <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> in a jurisdiction which has struck a civil law/common law compromise about the use of the concept. Australia presents itself as a fledgling nation in the development of <b>good</b> <b>faith,</b> while simultaneously being a CISG state subject to the <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> of Art. 7. The paper will therefore examine the following: The theoretical base on which a definition or explanation of the function of <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> is based is very divergent and will be discussed in part one. The conclusion which can be drawn from part one will be applied in part two to the most important available judicial decisions in determining whether there is consistency in the application of the concept. Part three will discuss whether the CISG and the domestic interpretative methods will influence the applications of <b>good</b> <b>faith...</b>|$|R
40|$|The growing {{recognition}} of obligation of <b>Good</b> <b>Faith</b> in contract law has only increased {{the debate surrounding}} this concept and its ramification on contract. The uneasiness about <b>Good</b> <b>Faith</b> should {{be attributed to the}} fact that <b>Good</b> <b>Faith</b> is an open norm or vague standard, which in practice means judicial law making. Furthermore, <b>Good</b> <b>Faith</b> suggests the teleological method of interpretation of contract and legislation in determining the rights and the duties of the parties to a contract. This, it is argued, would contradict the importance of certainty, private autonomy and commercial stability. The thesis presents the development and functions of <b>Good</b> <b>Faith,</b> in different jurisdiction, civil and common. It elaborates the arguments and counterarguments in the <b>Good</b> <b>Faith</b> debate from the context of major civil law and common law features. This will be mainly illustrated by maritime law related contracts. Finally, <b>Good</b> <b>Faith</b> in a possible uniform transnational maritime law will be discussed...|$|R

In order to make reinsurance affordable, a reinsurer cannot duplicate costly insurer underwriting and claim handling costs, and must rely on an insurer’s absolute transparency and candor.

5000|$|The {{doctrine}} of uberrimae fides - <b>utmost</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> - {{is present in}} the insurance law of all common law systems. An insurance contract is a contract of <b>utmost</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith.</b> The most important expression of that principle, under the doctrine as it has been interpreted in England, is that the prospective insured must accurately disclose to the insurer everything that he knows and that is or would be material to the reasonable insurer. Something is material if it would influence a prudent insurer in determining whether to write a risk, and if so upon what terms. If the insurer is not told everything material about the risk, or if a material misrepresentation is made, the insurer may avoid (or [...] "rescind") the policy, i.e. the insurer may treat the policy as having been void from inception, returning the premium paid. Reinsurance contracts (between reinsurers and insurers/cedents) require the highest level of <b>utmost</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith,</b> and such <b>utmost</b> <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> is considered the foundation of reinsurance.

Among the various innovations presented by the new Civil Procedure Code, a well-known and little used in the Brazilian legal order gets a real highlight in the Civil Procedure’s field: the <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> principle. The consecration of such an institute in the new Brazilian Civil Procedure Code, which came to be denominated by the doctrine as the procedural <b>good</b> <b>faith’s</b> principle, arise from the demand enlargement of the <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> in the private law and public law. Law nº 13. 105 of 2015 that instituted a new Civil Procedure Code, stablish that the subjects of the process who participate in it in any way, pass their behaviors according to <b>good</b> <b>faith,</b> according to the article 5 of the 2015 ’s Brazilian Civil Procedure Code. Such principle, which makes up a norm of conduct is aimed at repelling the procedural conducts derived from bad faith by considering them illicit. In addition, the general clause of the objective procedural <b>good</b> <b>faith</b> requires that the subjects of a proceeding do not present a corrupt conduct of bad-faith.
