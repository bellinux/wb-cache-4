5|$|On 20 October 1778, Boyle Roche married Mary Frankland of Great Thirkleby Hall, near Thirsk, Yorkshire, {{daughter}} of Admiral Sir Thomas Frankland, Bt, whose family name {{goes back to}} the time of William the Conqueror. Although childless, Boyle and Lady Mary appeared to have lived a life of <b>uninterrupted</b> happiness.|$|E
5|$|The Jeannette {{expedition}} {{was followed}} by the 1893–1896 Arctic expedition of Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen aboard the Fram, which proved that the Arctic Ocean was a deep oceanic basin, <b>uninterrupted</b> by any significant land masses north of the Eurasian continent.|$|E
5|$|The River Taff through Radyr is flanked on {{both sides}} by an undeveloped {{greenway}} that passes <b>uninterrupted</b> through northern Cardiff {{all the way to}} Cardiff Castle in the centre of the city, before the river enters Cardiff Bay.|$|E
5|$|The {{match was}} played during the Cold War, but {{during a period}} of {{increasing}} détente. The Soviet Chess School had long held a monopoly on the game at the highest level. Spassky was the latest in an <b>uninterrupted</b> chain of Soviet world chess champions, stretching back to the 1948 championship.|$|E
5|$|A major {{development}} of this period was the appearance of stellate (star-shaped) shrines in a few temples built of the traditional sandstone, such as the Trimurti Temple at Savadi, the Paramesvara Temple at Konnur and the Gauramma Temple at Hire Singgangutti. In all three cases, the shrine is a 16-pointed <b>uninterrupted</b> star, a ground-plan not found anywhere else in India and which entirely differentiates these temples from the 32-pointed interrupted star plans of bhumija shrines in northern India.|$|E
5|$|Between 1975 and 1990, real {{per capita}} income fell by more than 20%, wiping out almost three decades of {{economic}} development. The manufacturing industry, which had experienced a period of <b>uninterrupted</b> growth until the mid-1970s, began a process of continuous decline. The extreme dependence on state support of the many protected industries exacerbated the sharp fall of the industrial output. The degree of industrialization {{at the start of}} the 1990s was similar to its level in the 1940s.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{proximity}} of the city centre, the Žirmūnai bank of the River Neris is covered with a strip of dense deciduous forest that begins at the Žirmūnai Bridge and continues upstream (northeasterly). The forested strip is largely <b>uninterrupted,</b> with gaps near bridges. At the approximate centrepoint of the Žirmūnai shoreline, the forest surrounds a backwater, which had been used to park disused passenger ferries. The forest's northernmost section is part of a botanical nature reserve within Verkiai Regional Park.|$|E
5|$|Dorothee Pesch (born 3 June 1964), {{popularly known}} as Doro Pesch or Doro, is a German heavy metal singer-songwriter, {{formerly}} front-woman of the heavy metal band Warlock. The name Doro has also {{been associated with the}} touring band accompanying the singer, whose members have continuously changed in more than twenty years of <b>uninterrupted</b> activity, the most stable presences being those of bassist Nick Douglas and drummer Johnny Dee.|$|E
5|$|News of the {{armistice}} on 11 November 1918 reached Southern Rhodesia the same day, and was {{announced to the}} town of Salisbury by the repeated blowing of the klaxon at the Castle Brewery. Hysterical street parties started almost immediately, and in the evening the people let off fireworks and lit a huge bonfire on Salisbury kopje. Bulawayo celebrated with a street party that continued <b>uninterrupted</b> for over 48 hours. Smaller towns marked {{the armistice}} with their own celebratory functions and events.|$|E
5|$|Nyuserre {{is one of}} {{the very}} few Old Kingdom kings for whom there is {{evidence}} that the funerary cult continued <b>uninterrupted</b> during the First Intermediate Period, when the central authority of the pharaohs had broken down and the Egyptian state was in turmoil. The tombs of two priests Heryshefhotep I and II, who lived during this period, mention their roles and duties in the funerary establishment of Nyuserre, witnessing to the continuing existence of the official mortuary cult.|$|E
5|$|On 30 March 1945, {{the daily}} comic strip Rikki en Wiske started {{to appear in}} the {{newspaper}} De Nieuwe Standaard, after a positive review by the young illustrator Marc Sleen. It was an immediate success, and the first story ran <b>uninterrupted</b> until 15 December 1945. Vandersteen though was disappointed to see the editor had renamed the strip Rikki en Wiske instead of his suggestion Suske en Wiske, and also felt that Rikki too closely resembled Tintin.|$|E
5|$|The city of Minneapolis had {{connected}} 30 {{security cameras}} and 35 electronic street signs {{to the network}} {{by the end of}} 2010, with the intention to connect 50 network-enabled parking meters and 10 garbage trucks to the system in the near future. Fire and police conversion to the citywide network was also underway, though the city was taking necessary precautions to ensure that the two services, who will ultimately have their own dedicated frequency, continue to offer <b>uninterrupted</b> public safety service.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} scenes is {{heightened}} by alternating between objective and subjective perspectives, the warm {{face of the}} Earth and the depths of dark space, the chaos and unpredictability of the debris field, and silence in the vacuum of space with the background score giving the desired effect. The film uses very long, <b>uninterrupted</b> shots throughout to draw the audience into the action, but contrasts these with claustrophobic shots within space suits and capsules.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} known from Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, southeastern Mexico, and western Panama. It lives in humid {{evergreen}} forests that are sometimes interspersed with pine trees. It {{can be found}} at the edges of these forests typically in the middle and higher levels within these trees. It is also normally found only where cloud forest is <b>uninterrupted.</b>|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{editors of}} Shakespeare's plays have divided them into five acts. None {{of the early}} texts of Hamlet, however, were {{arranged}} this way, and the play's division into acts and scenes derives from a 1676 quarto. Modern editors generally follow this traditional division, but consider it unsatisfactory; for example, after Hamlet drags Polonius's body out of Gertrude's bedchamber, there is an act-break after which the action appears to continue <b>uninterrupted.</b>|$|E
5|$|Written by Joseph Lidster. A story idea {{considered}} for {{the third and fourth}} episodes of the fourth series. It involved a new children's television show that causes its viewer to become possessed. The aliens responsible harness electrical impulses in the viewers' brains, their aim being to eradicate humanity so that they can live <b>uninterrupted</b> in the electricity.|$|E
5|$|A major railway, {{known as}} the Eurasian Land Bridge allows goods to be transported from China and the EEU to Europe. An {{expansion}} of the original railway line named the New Eurasian Land Bridge provides an <b>uninterrupted</b> rail link between China and the EEU. Talks with China, India and Burma are ongoing to expand the railway network. In June 2014, {{it was announced that}} Russia, North Korea and South Korea would cooperate to expand the Eurasian Land Bridge to connect the peninsula. Advantages of exporting products by rail through the EEU are reduced shipping times and reduced costs. The railways also have the potential for expansion, with the future creation of high-speed railway lines being considered.|$|E
5|$|Adding to {{the chaos}} were {{fears of a}} {{potential}} second explosion. A cloud of steam shot out of ventilators at the ammunition magazine at Wellington Barracks as naval personnel extinguished a fire by the magazine. While the fire was quickly put out, the cloud was seen from blocks away and quickly led to rumours that another explosion was imminent. Uniformed officers ordered everyone away from the area. As the rumour spread across the city, many families fled their homes. The confusion hampered efforts for over two hours until fears were dispelled by about noon. However, many rescuers ignored the evacuation and naval rescue parties continued working <b>uninterrupted</b> at the harbour.|$|E
5|$|Bedtime Stories also {{performed}} well in Asia-Pacific. It debuted at {{number one on}} the ARIA Charts on November 6, 1994, and remained on the chart for 30 weeks. The album was certified double platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipment of 140,000 copies. It experienced moderate success in New Zealand, debuting at its peak of number six, before dropping to number 16 the next week, and remaining for nine weeks in total. Bedtime Stories entered the Japanese Oricon Weekly Album Chart at number nine, continuing Madonna's <b>uninterrupted</b> streak of top ten hit albums there. In total, Bedtime Stories has sold an estimated eight million copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|By the 16th {{century the}} castle was 'tending to ruin', and {{following}} his {{victory in the}} English Civil War Oliver Cromwell decreed its destruction in 1655, a process which was completed within a fortnight. The castle had stood on the main route from Bristol to London, and following its destruction a commercial avenue opened along Castle Street from the mediaeval city towards Old Market. The demolition of Lawford's Gate at {{the eastern end of}} Old Market Street extended this into West Street, creating an <b>uninterrupted</b> route into the bustling heart of Bristol.|$|E
5|$|China's {{rail system}} had long {{linked to the}} Trans-Siberian via northeastern China and Mongolia. In 1990 China added a link between its rail system and the Trans-Siberian via Kazakhstan. China calls its <b>uninterrupted</b> rail link between {{the port city of}} Lianyungang and Kazakhstan the New Eurasian Land Bridge or Second Eurasian Continental Bridge. In {{addition}} to Kazakhstan, the railways connect with other countries in Central Asia and the Middle East, including Iran. With the October 2013 completion of the rail link across the Bosphorus under the Marmaray project the New Eurasian Land Bridge now theoretically connects to Europe via Central and South Asia.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{started on}} the {{extension}} in 1914. To allow for {{the extension of the}} line south from Times Square, the entire western wall of the subway between 43rd Street and 44th Street was removed, all while service continued <b>uninterrupted.</b> The line was mostly built in an open-cut, excluding the segments within the limits of Battery Park, the widened portions of Varick Street, and the new Varick and Seventh Avenue Extensions. Filled in ground was found south of Varick Street along Greenwich Street, which approximately marked the old shore line of the Hudson River {{during the time of the}} American Revolution. Many buildings had to be underpinned during the construction of the line, especially those on the lower sections through Greenwich Street.|$|E
5|$|Further {{development}} {{included the}} repetition of Curvilinear or flame-like forms that occur in {{a great number of}} windows of around 1320, notably in the retro-choir at Wells and the nave of Exeter Cathedral. This type of tracery is often seen in combination with vaulting ribs of extreme projection and very rich moulding, as is seen in the chapter house at Wells, and the vault at Exeter, which stretches, <b>uninterrupted</b> by a central tower, for 91 metres (300ft) and is the longest medieval vault in the world.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, the Environment Secretary, Peter Walker {{announced}} {{the entire length}} of the A303 would be upgraded as part of a new roads programme that would deliver 1,000 new miles of motorway by 1980. A bypass of Marsh was opened in 1976; it was (and remains) the only dual carriageway upgrade of the A303 through the Blackdown Hills. By the mid-1980s, the A303 had been extended from its original fork by Micheldever Station, next to the A30, eastwards to meet the M3 motorway, and was a completely <b>uninterrupted</b> dual carriageway westwards as far as Amesbury. Ilminster was bypassed around this time; however the new road was built as single carriageway with 3 lanes, which caused a serious safety hazard leading to several fatal accidents.|$|E
5|$|Ipswich {{have won}} the English league title once, in their first season in the top flight in 1961–62, and have twice {{finished}} runners-up, in 1980–81 and 1981–82. They won the FA Cup in 1977–78, and the UEFA Cup in 1980–81. They have competed in the top two tiers of English football <b>uninterrupted</b> since 1957–58. They have competed in all three European club competitions, and have never lost at home in European competition, defeating Real Madrid, A.C. Milan, Inter Milan, Lazio and Barcelona, among others.|$|E
5|$|James and comedian Jimmy Kimmel co-{{hosted the}} 2007 ESPY Awards. In other comedic pursuits, he hosted the 33rd-season premiere of Saturday Night Live. He has also tried {{his hand at}} acting, {{appearing}} in a cameo role on the HBO series Entourage. In 2015, he played himself in the Judd Apatow film Trainwreck, receiving positive reviews for his performance. That same year, James' digital video company, <b>Uninterrupted,</b> raised $15.8 million from Warner Bros. Entertainment and Turner Sports to help expand the company's efforts to bring athlete-created content to fans. It is hosted on Bleacher Report and is used by several other athletes including New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski and Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota's state {{government}} cannot operate without appropriations under law, as {{mandated by the}} Minnesota Constitution. However, state courts have determined that Priority One and Two Critical Services must continue {{in the event of}} a shutdown. Services that must remain <b>uninterrupted</b> to avoid a potential immediate threat to public health or safety are considered Priority One, and some additional services are designated Priority Two. Before the shutdown, a list of priority services was compiled and prepared by Minnesota Management and Budget, based on recommendations from state agencies.|$|E
5|$|Morgan {{had waited}} until her {{academic}} rank was secure before becoming pregnant. She {{had a son}} in 1923, {{the same year that}} she became a full professor. Colleagues were surprised when she had the baby, as she had not mentioned being pregnant and she hid the physical evidence of her pregnancy with her long laboratory jacket. Morgan remembered the reaction of one male colleague when she told him the news; he said if she had five children like he did, she would have hardly noticed the new baby. Morgan's mother moved in with her and cared for the baby so that Morgan could work <b>uninterrupted.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{overlaps}} {{were eliminated}} {{as time went}} on. In the early 1940s, NY32A was reassigned to another highway in the Catskill Mountains while NY32B was truncated to end in Hudson Falls. The former routing of NY32A became a realignment of NY32, creating an <b>uninterrupted</b> overlap between US4 and NY32 from Waterford to Northumberland. In the mid-1950s, work began on a project to upgrade a pre-existing riverside highway between Bemis Heights and Schuylerville. The project was completed by 1958, at which time the roadway became part of a realigned US4. The overlap with NY40 was eliminated in the late 1950s when NY40 was truncated to begin at the junction of US4 and Winter Street.|$|E
5|$|Production of the Rolls-Royce Merlin {{was driven}} by the forethought and {{determination}} of Ernest Hives, who at times was enraged by the apparent complacency and lack of urgency encountered in his frequent correspondence with Air Ministry and local authority officials. Hives was an advocate of shadow factories, and, sensing the imminent outbreak of war, pressed ahead with plans to produce the Merlin in sufficient numbers for the rapidly expanding Royal Air Force. Despite the importance of <b>uninterrupted</b> production, several factories were affected by industrial action. By {{the end of its}} production run in 1950, 168,176 Merlin engines had been built; over 112,000 in Britain and more than 55,000 under licence in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Screen {{time was}} divided up equally between the couples {{over the course}} of an episode, though {{occasionally}} some scenes would run longer; in Series 4, Episode 3, the scenes of Karen clubbing went on for ten <b>uninterrupted</b> minutes. These scenes were also a rarity for location filming; usually filming in public places was done on a Sunday during closing hours but the clubbing scenes in this episode were filmed during opening hours at the Music Box in Manchester. A hand-held camera was used to enhance the frenetic pace.|$|E
5|$|The Bucknill Committee, {{which had}} been set up to {{investigate}} the loss of major warships, also produced a report. This report said that the lack of backup power sources was a major design failure, which contributed to the loss: Ark Royal depended on electricity for much of her operation, and once the boilers and steam-driven dynamos were knocked out, the loss of power made damage control difficult. The committee recommended the design of the bulkheads and boiler intakes be improved to decrease the risk of widespread flooding in boiler rooms and machine spaces, while the <b>uninterrupted</b> boiler room flat was criticised. The design flaws were rectified in the Illustrious- and Implacable-class carriers, under construction at the time.|$|E
5|$|The C-SPAN network's core {{programming}} is {{live coverage of}} the U.S. House and Senate, with the C-SPAN channel emphasizing the United States House of Representatives. Between 1979 and May 2011, the network televised more than 24,246 hours of floor action. C-SPAN2, the first of the C-SPAN spin-off networks, provides <b>uninterrupted</b> {{live coverage of the}} United States Senate. With coverage of the House and Senate, viewers can track legislation as it moves through both bodies of Congress. Important debates in Congress that C-SPAN has covered live include the Persian Gulf conflict during 1991, and the House impeachment vote and Senate trial of President Bill Clinton in 1998 and 1999. When the House or Senate are not in session, C-SPAN channels broadcast other public affairs programming.|$|E
5|$|The Citra Awards, {{then known}} as the Indonesian Film Festival Awards, were first given at the IFF in early 1955; that year's Best Supporting Actress was Endang Kusdiningsih {{for her role in}} Tarmina. Succeeding festivals were held in 1960 and 1967. From 1973 the IFF was held annually. This {{continued}} <b>uninterrupted</b> until after the 1992 IFF, when a sharp decline in film production led the festival to be discontinued. It was reinstated as an annual event in 2004, after receiving funds from the Indonesian government. The most recent winner is Raihaanun, who won a Citra Award at the 2016 IFF for her acting in Salawaku.|$|E
5|$|The New Eurasian Land Bridge, {{also called}} the New Eurasian Continental Bridge, is the name given to China's rail link with Central Asia. The route {{includes}} China's east-west railways which, {{in addition to the}} Beijiang line, are the Longhai Railway and the Lanzhou–Xinjiang Railway. Together, the railways create an <b>uninterrupted</b> rail link between the port city of Lianyungang in Jiangsu province and Kazakhstan. In 1995 the Chinese and Kazakhstan governments signed an agreement which allows the latter to use Lianyungang as its primary seaport for exports and imports, and the former intends for Lianyungang to serve as the designated starting point for the New Eurasian Land Bridge.|$|E
5|$|The Rhodesia Party {{remained}} in power until September 1933, when, despite narrowly topping the popular vote, it lost the month's election, winning only {{nine of the}} 30 seats compared to the Reform Party's 16. Although the Reform Party was left-wing in name, many of its leading members, including the new Prime Minister Dr Godfrey Huggins, were politically conservative; the more rightist members of the party merged with the Rhodesia Party in 1934 to form the United Party, and, with Huggins at the helm, roundly defeated the rump left wing of the Reform Party to begin 28 years of <b>uninterrupted</b> stewardship.|$|E
