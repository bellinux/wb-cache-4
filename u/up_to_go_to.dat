5|$|Solo {{was born}} in Richland, Washington on July 30, 1981 to Judy Lynn (née Shaw) and Jeffrey Solo. Her father, an Italian-American Vietnam War veteran, who {{was in and out}} of her life as a child and teenager, taught her how to play soccer at a young age. When Solo was seven, her father picked her and her brother Marcus <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a {{baseball}} game in the nearby city of Yakima, but ended up driving over three hours west to Seattle, where they stayed for several days at a hotel. Solo described how it seemed like a vacation at first, but soon realized it was not. Police later found them at a downtown bank and arrested Jeffrey for alleged kidnapping. Although her parents had divorced when she was six and she lived with her mother, Solo maintained a close relationship with her father after reconnecting with him during her college years at the University of Washington. He continued to be a major influence in her life until his death of a heart attack in June 2007.|$|E
25|$|Following on, Laborit {{considered}} whether chlorpromazine {{may have}} a role in managing patients with severe burns, Raynaud's phenomenon, or psychiatric disorders. At the Villejuif Mental Hospital in November 1951, he and Montassut administered an intravenous dose to psychiatrist Cornelia Quarti who was acting as a volunteer. Quarti noted the indifference, but fainted upon getting <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the toilet, and so further testing was discontinued (orthostatic hypotension is a possible side effect of chlorpromazine). Despite this, Laborit continued to push for testing in psychiatric patients during early 1952. Psychiatrists were reluctant initially, but on January 19, 1952, it was administered (alongside pethidine, pentothal and ECT) to Jacques Lh. a 24-year-old manic patient, who responded dramatically, and was discharged after three weeks having received 855mg of the drug in total.|$|E
500|$|... "Manic Monday" [...] {{is a song}} by the American pop {{rock band}} The Bangles, and the first single {{released}} from their second studio album, Different Light (1986). It was written by American musician Prince, using the pseudonym [...] "Christopher". Originally intended for the group Apollonia 6 in 1984, he offered the song to The Bangles two years later. Lyrically, it describes {{a woman who is}} waking <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> work on Monday, wishing it were still Sunday where she could relax.|$|E

500|$|One year later, BTRO's {{best friend}} KCDC finds JTRO {{working as a}} lumberjack. KCDC convinces JTRO that the FP needs him because L Dubba E has taken control of the local alcohol {{industry}} and is refusing to sell alcoholic drinks to everyone. The lack of alcohol {{has led to an}} increase in methamphetamine addicts, a decrease in [...] homeless people and, consequently, ducks. Reluctantly, JTRO returns with KCDC; he meets BLT and reunites with Stacy, an old friend. JTRO and Stacy are interrupted by L Dubba Enow Stacy's boyfriendwho is picking her <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a party. JTRO goes to the same party and Stacy drunkenly flirts with him. L Dubba E taunts JTRO then hits him with a baseball bat, rendering him unconscious. JTRO dreams that BTRO tells him to fight back, pushing him to challenge L Dubba E. L Dubba E declines, saying that JTRO lacks sufficient [...] "street cred". L Dubba E demands that JTRO defeat Triple Decka 1K before he will accept JTRO's challenge.|$|E
500|$|The Tyneside Theatre company {{presented}} a stage version of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight at the University Theatre, Newcastle at Christmas 1971. It {{was directed by}} Michael Bogdanov and adapted for the stage from the translation by Brian Stone. The music and lyrics were composed by Iwan Williams using medieval carols, such as the Boar's Head Carol, as inspiration and folk instruments such as the Northumbrian pipes, whistles and bhodran to create a [...] "rough" [...] feel. Stone had referred Bogdanov to Cuchulain and the Beheading Game, a sequence which is contained in The Grenoside Sword dance. Bogdanov found the pentangle theme to be contained in most sword dances, and so incorporated a long sword dance while Gawain lay tossing uneasily before getting <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the Green Chapel. The dancers made the knot of the pentangle around his drowsing head with their swords. The interlacing of the hunting and wooing scenes was achieved by frequent cutting of the action from hunt to bed-chamber and back again, while the locale of both remained on-stage.|$|E
2500|$|Best {{suffered}} from alcoholism {{for most of}} his adult life, leading to numerous controversies and, eventually, his death. In 1981, while playing in the United States, Best stole money from the handbag of a woman he did not know in order to fund a drinking session. [...] "We were sitting in a bar on the beach, and when she got <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the toilet I leaned over and took all the money she had in her bag." ...|$|E

5000|$|Prefixes {{are also}} used in Muscogee for shades of meaning of verbs that are expressed, in English, by adverbs in phrasal verbs. For example, in English, the verb <b>to</b> <b>go</b> can be changed <b>to</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up,</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> in, <b>to</b> <b>go</b> around, and other variations. In Muscogee, the same {{principle}} of shading a verb's meaning is handled by locative prefixes: ...|$|R

2500|$|Shortly {{before the}} crash, several {{witnesses}} described seeing an aircraft flying unusually low towards the Continental Divide. Some witnesses located on higher mountainside locations, such as Loveland Pass at , reported seeing it flying below them. Crash survivor Rick Stephens {{was a senior}} guard and stated in 2013, [...] "...as we flew along over I-70, that there were old mines and old vehicles above us. I noticed we were quite a bit below {{the top of the}} mountains. [...] I got <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the cockpit, which wasn't unusual to do, and I could tell we were in trouble, looking out the window and seeing nothing but green in front of us." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 1941, {{while still}} at the conservatory, Mackerras began to get {{professional}} performing jobs in Sydney, partly {{because he was too}} young to join the military, while older musicians had been called <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the war. From 1941 to 1942, Mackerras played the oboe for the J. C. Williamson Company during one of their Gilbert and Sullivan seasons, and he was a rehearsal pianist for the Kirsova ballet company. In 1943, Mackerras joined the ABC Sydney Orchestra, under Malcolm Sargent, as second oboist and at age 19, became principal oboist. On [...] 1947, Mackerras sailed for England on the RMS Rangitiki intending to pursue conducting. He joined Sadler's Wells Theatre as an orchestral oboist and cor anglais player. He later won a British Council Scholarship, enabling him to study conducting with Václav Talich at the Prague Academy of Music. While there, he formed a strong friendship with Jiří Tancibudek, Principal Oboe of the Czech Philharmonic, who introduced him to the operas of Leoš Janáček, thus commencing Mackerras's lifelong passion for that composer's music.|$|E
