5|$|Texas {{was stopped}} {{on their first}} drive due to an {{unsuccessful}} fourth down conversion. Baylor's first possession ended when UT's Michael Huff intercepted a pass from Baylor's Terrance Park. Longhorn Jamaal Charles scored a touchdown on the drive but the kick was blocked, giving Texas the only first-quarter score and a 6–0 lead. Texas extended {{the lead in the}} secondquarter with rushing touchdowns from Henry Melton, Jamaal Charles, and Ramonce Taylor. Taylor made two more touchdowns in the thirdquarter and Quan Cosby caught a touchdown pass from Young. In the fourth quarter, Taylor scored his fourthtouchdown and backup quarterback Matt Nordgren scored on an odd play where he was hit and fumbled while scrambling for the goal line but the ball traveled forward at about the same speed he was running and bounced right back <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> hands. Texas won the 2005game 62–0 making it the only shutout of the 2005season for the Longhorns.|$|E

He takes off his gun and balances it on a banister. As he begins to wash up at the bathroom sink, he looks <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> own reflection and contemplates himself for a long moment.|$|E

25|$|After marrying, Joseph and Jessie Wilson {{moved to}} the Southern United States in 1851 and came to fully {{identify}} with it, moving from Virginia deeper into the region as Wilson became a minister in Georgia and South Carolina. Joseph Wilson owned slaves, defended slavery, and also set up a Sunday school for his slaves. Both parents identified with the Confederacy during the American Civil War; they cared for wounded soldiers at their church, and Wilson's father briefly served as a chaplain to the Confederate Army. Woodrow Wilson's earliest memory, {{from the age of}} three, was of hearing that Abraham Lincoln had been elected and that a war was coming. Wilson would forever recall standing for a moment at General Robert E. Lee's side and looking <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> face.|$|E
25|$|With enemy {{resistance}} intensifying {{as the air}} war advances {{deeper into}} Germany, missions become longer and riskier, and many of Savage's best men are shot down or killed. Pritchard tries to get Savage {{to return to a}} staff job at VIII Bomber Command but Savage refuses because he feels that the 918th is not ready to stand up without him yet. Reluctantly, Pritchard leaves him in command. After a particularly brutal mission, Savage's iron will cracks. On the day of the first daylight bombing raid on Berlin, he finds himself physically unable to haul himself <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> B-17. The redeemed Ben Gately takes his place as lead pilot and strike commander for the mission. While waiting for the group’s return, Savage becomes catatonic. Only as they return to Archbury does Savage regain his composure and fall asleep.|$|E

2500|$|The last {{survivor}} of the Ludlow Massacre, Mary Benich-McCleary, died of a stroke {{at the age of}} 94 on June 28, 2007. She was 18 months old when the massacre occurred. [...] McCleary's parents and her two brothers narrowly escaped death when the conductor of the train that brought the militia to the tent colony stopped the train to shield the family and others trying to flee, but Mary had been left behind. A 16-year-old boy heard her screams, gathered her <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> coat and then ran into the woods. Mary and the boy were found several days later, still hiding.

2500|$|For Series 10, Capaldi {{described}} his character as more 'closed off' and 'suspicious' {{than the previous}} season, he elaborated 'If you’ve been following this Doctor, you’ve seen him go through all those different colours and all those different places, and as for where he goes now, I don’t know, but he’s been put through the mill.” Capaldi {{expressed in terms of}} his character 'Because in some ways he’s much more amenable, but in other ways he’s even darker. So I think that makes for a very interesting character.' Upon discussing the interaction between The Doctor and his latest companion Bill Potts, Capaldi elaborated “It’s a kind of teacher-pupil relationship, but it becomes more complex than that and I think ultimately the Doctor has to undergo some dramas by himself. So I think he becomes slightly worried that he’s swept someone else <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> adventures without quite preparing them.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 3rd century, Roman Britain {{underwent}} profound changes. With {{the return}} of soldiers to the island, their first task was to drive back the Picts, who had {{taken advantage of the}} absence of Roman troops to raid and plunder extensively. As a result, Septimius Severus ordered a large-scale punitive expedition against the tribes north of Hadrian's Wall and even reoccupied the Antonine Wall for a short time. Unlike the other provinces, Britain appeared relatively stable and calm. The short-term separation of the island {{from the rest of the}} Empire under the usurper Carausius showed that this was an illusion and that the power of Rome was becoming increasingly weaker in Britain as well. Carausius used inter alia the anger of the Britons arising from their neglect by Rome for his own power-political purposes and founded his own empire consisting of Britain and a strip of land in northern Gaul. He wanted to build it <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> own centre of power within the Roman world, but failed in the face of a Roman counter-offensive ordered by Constantius Chlorus, which soon toppled the newly founded Romano-British Empire. In the late 3rd and into the 4th century, the security situation on the continent became critical again, as the pressure from barbarian tribes on the borders of the Rhine and Danube had not waned. From the 4th century, Britain was again increasingly the target of attacks by Saxons, Picts and Scots. The last named sailed around Hadrian's Wall and initially penetrated far into the south of the country. The crews of the watchtowers and forts on the coast of Cumbria were usually only able to warn the population. Due to the precarious security situation in the rest of the Empire, units were increasingly withdrawn from the island so that, in the end, the British provinces were almost exclusively guarded by locally raised auxilia or newly recruited Germanic mercenaries. At the end of the 4th century, the last Roman troops left their camps in Wales, with the result that raiding and settling by the Irish significantly increased there. Around 400 AD, much of Hadrian's Wall also had to be abandoned for lack of troops. Most units of the mobile field army were ordered to leave Britain in 401/402 to go to the defence of Italy against the Visigoths [...] under Alaric.|$|E
