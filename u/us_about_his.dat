25|$|Having visited Turkey {{before on}} {{official}} business, Georgescu {{was able to}} use his contacts there to notify Schumpeter and Leontief at Harvard University in the <b>US</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> flight. Leontief offered Georgescu a position at Harvard, and made the necessary arrangements for the couple in advance of their arrival there.|$|E
25|$|The {{emphasis}} on the oral qualities of traditional story telling are also evident in this short story. The narrator is telling <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> journey, and his anguish during his delirious night. This narration is full of voices, for example as don Chepe and Niña Tina respond to Cuero de Oro's exhortation. Asturias even ends the tale with the final sentence: and the conversation ended. The textual interplay between Cuero de Oro and don Chepe and Niña Tina can also be interpreted as representative {{of a child who}} is searching for the roots of his identity, questioning those who have access to this knowledge of another (mythical) time and space.|$|E
500|$|Soderbergh {{replied to}} the {{criticism}} that he made an unconventional film: [...] "I find it hilarious {{that most of the}} stuff being written about movies is how conventional they are, and then you have people ... upset that something's not conventional. The bottom line is we're just trying to {{give you a sense of}} what it was like to hang out around this person. That's really it. And the scenes were chosen strictly on the basis of, 'Yeah, what does that tell <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> character?'".|$|E

Moreover, he spoke to <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> vision of the Promised Land, a land of justice and equality, brotherhood and peace. Martin dedicated his life to the goals of peace and unity among all peoples, and perhaps nowhere in the world is there a greater appreciation of the desirability and necessity of peace than in Israel." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{was silent}} for a moment or two, and then went on in a tone that made Festing's heart beat: [...] "You gave him work and helped him to make a new start. He was too proud to tell <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> difficulties." ...|$|E
60|$|Doolittle had {{not seen}} the traitor's face. The man rose from the bush, he said, shot him, seized the pony, and rode off in a second with {{ruthless}} haste. He was tall and thin, but erect--that was all the wounded scout could tell <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> assailant. And THAT was not enough to identify Sebastian.|$|E
50|$|In his autobiography, Ibn Khaldūn tells <b>us</b> little <b>about</b> <b>his</b> {{conflict}} with Ibn al-Khatib {{and the reasons}} for his departure. The orientalist Muhsin Mahdi interprets this as showing that Ibn Khaldūn later realised that he had completely misjudged Muhammad V.|$|R
5000|$|Acting on a tip, police {{picked up}} and interrogated Martin E. Frazier, a 20-year-old <b>U.S.</b> Marine, <b>about</b> <b>his</b> {{possible}} involvement {{in the murder of}} Russell Anton Marleau. Frazier, along with his cousin, Jerry Lee Rawls, was seen at a bar with the victim before the murder.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here, there's a bit for {{yourself}}, old boy. Sit {{down and}} enjoy yourself while Jack tells <b>us</b> all <b>about</b> <b>his</b> interview with royalty," [...] said Peterkin, handing {{a lump of}} tobacco to our guide, whose eyes glistened and white teeth gleamed as he received the much-prized gift.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is Katia," [...] Akim said, {{jumping up}} from his seat and opening the door. A young woman entered. She was {{pleasant}} and intelligent looking. [...] "Katia, this is an English gentleman, a friend of ours, who has been telling <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> country. Godfrey, this is my cousin Katia; she teaches music in the houses of many people of good family." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{were all}} sitting on deck together, {{those of us}} who were not on duty, and {{listening}} to yarns from one another, as idle men will, when the conversation happened accidentally to turn on Queensland, and Lemarchant began to enlighten <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> own doings when he was in the colony. He boasted a great deal about his prowess as a disperser of the black fellows, which he seemed to consider a very noble sort of occupation. There was nobody in the colony, he said, who had ever dispersed so many blacks as he had; and he'd like to be back there, dispersing again, for, in the matter of sport, it beat kangaroo-hunting, or any other kind of shooting he had ever yet tried his hand at, all to pieces.|$|E
60|$|I {{wish you}} would learn of Everett what he would take, over and above a {{discharge}} for all the trouble we have been at, to take his business out of our hands {{and give it to}} somebody else. It is impossible to collect money on that or any other claim here now; and although you know I am not a very petulant man, I declare I am almost out of patience with Mr. Everett's importunity. It seems like he not only writes all the letters he can himself, but gets everybody else in Louisville and vicinity to be constantly writing to <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> claim. I have always said that Mr. Everett is a very clever fellow, and I am very sorry he cannot be obliged; but it does seem to me he ought to know we are interested to collect his claim, and therefore would do it if we could.|$|E
50|$|A {{grassroots}} petition {{has been}} {{started on the}} White House website (whitehouse.gov) asking President Obama to direct the Department of Justice to thoroughly investigate, under the federal witness murder statute, whether Todd was killed {{to keep him from}} talking to <b>U.S.</b> authorities <b>about</b> <b>his</b> work with the Chinese.|$|R
6000|$|The {{whole place}} {{was full of}} wailing. Revenge was all the cry. 'Let not their pigs be killed,' said Takua; 'we will give them to Bisope, he shall avenge us.' His brother Dikea broke out: 'My humour is bad because Bisope does not take <b>us</b> <b>about</b> in <b>his</b> vessel to kill-kill these people!' ...|$|R

6000|$|This is {{our view}} of the law on the point; and, we dare to say, so will it be ruled. Perhaps, however, in reality, all that he tells <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> youth is rather with a view to {{increase}} our wonder than to soften our censures. He possibly means to say, [...] "See how a minor can write! This poem was actually composed by a young man of eighteen, and this by one of only sixteen!" [...] But, alas! We all remember the poetry of Cowley at ten, and Pope at twelve; and so far from hearing, with any degree of surprise, that very poor verses were written by a youth from his leaving school to his leaving college, inclusive, we really believe this to be the most common of all occurrences; that it happens in the life of nine men in ten who are educated in England; and that the tenth man writes better verse than Lord Byron.|$|E
6000|$|... 'They prick {{the skin}} till the blood runs, and rub in {{coloured}} juices. Allo was painted blue, green, and red {{from his forehead}} to his ankles. He said {{it was part of}} his religion. He told <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> religion (Pertinax was always interested in such things), and as we came to know him well, he told us what was happening in Britain behind the Wall. Many things took place behind us in those days. And by the Light of the Sun,' said Parnesius, earnestly, 'there was not much that those little people did not know! He told me when Maximus crossed over to Gaul, after he had made himself Emperor of Britain, and what troops and emigrants he had taken with him. We did not get the news on the Wall till fifteen days later. He told me what troops Maximus was taking out of Britain every month to help him to conquer Gaul; and I always found the numbers were as he said. Wonderful! And I tell another strange thing!' ...|$|E
6000|$|A case of {{the kind}} {{happened}} in Berlin several years ago. William Walter Phelps was our Minister at the Emperor's Court, then, and one evening he had me to dinner to meet Count S., a cabinet minister. This nobleman was of long and illustrious descent. Of course I wanted to let {{out the fact that}} I had some ancestors, too; but I did not want to pull them out of their graves by the ears, and I never could seem to get the chance to work them in {{in a way that would}} look sufficiently casual. I suppose Phelps was in the same difficulty. In fact he looked distraught, now and then--just as a person looks who wants to uncover an ancestor purely by accident, and cannot think of a way that will seem accidental enough. But at last, after dinner, he made a try. He took <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> drawing-room, showing us the pictures, and finally stopped before a rude and ancient engraving. It was a picture of the court that tried Charles I. There was a pyramid of judges in Puritan slouch hats, and below them three bare-headed secretaries seated at a table. Mr. Phelps put his finger upon one of the three, and said with exulting indifference-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's the Frate's doctrines that he's {{to prove}} by being burned," [...] said that large public {{character}} Goro, {{who happened to}} be among the foremost gazers. [...] "The Signoria has taken it in hand, and the writing is to let us know. It's what the Padre has been telling <b>us</b> <b>about</b> in <b>his</b> sermon." ...|$|R
5000|$|Richard Nilsen {{also with}} his {{official}} statement said {{the film was}} [...] "Director Carrasco uses shadows and mirrors to create effects he has no actual budget for. The lack of money shows on-screen but is cleverly hidden by the director's genius for making <b>us</b> care <b>about</b> <b>his</b> story {{so much that we}} forgive all else." ...|$|R
25|$|In metaphysics, Armstrong {{defends the}} view that {{universals}} exist (although Platonic uninstantiated universals do not exist). Those universals match up with the fundamental particles that science tells <b>us</b> <b>about.</b> Armstrong describes <b>his</b> philosophy {{as a form of}} scientific realism.|$|R
6000|$|... "Crowsfeather {{has spoken}} of the Jews as lost. I am not {{surprised}} to hear it. It {{seems to me that}} all pale-faces get lost. They wander from their own hunting-grounds into those of other people. It is not so with Injins. The Pottawattamie does not kill the deer of the Iowa, nor the Ottawa the deer of the Menomenees. Each tribe knows its own game. This is because they are not lost. My pale-face father appears to wish us well. He has come on a long and weary path to tell <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> Manitou. For this I thank him. I thank all who wish to do me good. Them that wish to do me harm I strike from behind. It is our Injin custom. I do not wish to hurt the medicine- priest, because I think he wishes to do me good, and not to do me harm. He has a strange law. It is to do good to them that do harm to you. It is not the law of the red men. It is not good law. I do not wonder that the tribes which follow such a law get lost. They cannot tell their friends from their enemies. They can have no people to scalp. What is a warrior if he cannot find someone to scalp? No; such a law would make women of the bravest braves in the Openings, or on the prairie. It may be a good law for Jews, who get lost; but it is a bad law for Injins, who know the paths they travel. Let another speak." ...|$|E
60|$|The shower being now over, we {{went out}} upon the {{beautiful}} lawn before his house, where there were a good many trees of various kinds, {{many of which have}} been set out by persons of great or small distinction, and are labelled with their names. Thomas Moore's name was appended to one; Maria Edgeworth's to another; likewise Fredrika Bremer's, Jenny Lind's; also Grace Greenwood's, and I know not whose besides. This is really a pleasant method of enriching one's grounds with memorials of friends, nor is there any harm in making a shrubbery of celebrities. Three holes were already dug, and three new trees lay ready to be planted, and for me there was a sumach to plant,--a tree I never liked; but Mr. Hall said that they had tried to dig up a hawthorn, but found it clung too fast to the soil. So, since better might not be, and telling Mr. Hall that I supposed I should have a right to hang myself on this tree whenever I chose, I seized a spade, and speedily shovelled in a great deal of dirt; and there stands my sumach, an object of interest to posterity! Bennoch also and Dr. ------ set out their trees, and indeed, it was in some sense a joint affair, {{for the rest of the}} party held up each tree, while its godfather shovelled in the earth; but, after all, the gardener had more to do with it than we. After this important business was over, Mr. Hall led <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> rounds, which are very nicely planned and ordered; and all this he has bought, and built, and laid out, from the profits of his own and his wife's literary exertions.|$|E

"For the fust day Sam felt {{uneasy about}} ’im, {{and used to}} tell <b>us</b> tales <b>about</b> <b>’is</b> dead brother which made us think Beauty was lucky to take arter ’is mother; but it wore off, and the next night, in the Admiral Cochrane, ’e put ’is ’ead on Ginger’s shoulder, and wep’ for ’appiness as ’e spoke of ’is nevy’s home at ’’Appy Cottage.’ ...|$|R

50|$|The {{figure of}} Doc Hata {{functions}} {{as the narrator}} and tells {{every part of the}} story through his eyes. He tells <b>us</b> not only <b>about</b> <b>his</b> time in Bedley Run, but also very briefly <b>about</b> <b>his</b> childhood, then <b>about</b> <b>his</b> time in World War II, and also <b>about</b> <b>his</b> time with his daughter Sunny. He does not tell all these events in chronological order but instead in sporadic episodes. The novel consists of several flashbacks which tell <b>us</b> more <b>about</b> Hata's life and his rituals.|$|R

50|$|As a Renaissance man, Herrera was {{interested}} in all the branches of knowledge of his times. His Discurso sobre la figura cúbica (Discussion of the Cubic form) tells <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> notable knowledge about geometry and mathematics.

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of this part, two of Tyler's compatriots from his European vacation decide to visit Tyler in Lancaster. They are Monique and Stephanie. Stephanie is Tyler's secret shame from Europe, as he had a summer relationship with her.

6000|$|... [17] How {{characteristic}} of Bunyan is this sentence, 'the rich voyage.' God environing <b>us</b> <b>about</b> with <b>his</b> presence in time, and eternal felicity in the desired haven: 'the lumpish heart' at times apparently {{indifferent to the}} glorious harvest: 'a pair of spurs' to prick us on in the course. The word voyage (from via, a way) was in Bunyan's time equally used for a journey by sea or land, it is now limited to travelling by sea.--Ed.|$|R
50|$|Although Pausanias {{is given}} a {{significant}} speaking part in Plato's Symposium, very {{little is known about}} him.
