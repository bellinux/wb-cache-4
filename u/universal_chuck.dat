50|$|Austin F. Cushman (June 18, 1830 - November 29, 1914) {{invented the}} {{self-centering}} Cushman <b>universal</b> <b>chuck</b> in 1862; his father-in-law, Simon Fairman, had previously invented the lathe chuck.|$|E
50|$|Simon Fairman (1792-1857) of West Stafford, Connecticut, is {{credited}} as having invented the scroll-type lathe chuck in 1830; his son-in-law, Austin F. Cushman invented the self-centering Cushman <b>Universal</b> <b>Chuck.</b> He was issued a patent for his design by the US Patent Office on July 18, 1840.|$|E
50|$|A {{self-centering}} chuck, {{also known}} as a , uses dogs (usually called jaws), interconnected via a scroll gear (scroll plate), to hold onto a tool or workpiece. Because they most often have three jaws, the term three-jaw chuck without other qualification is understood by machinists to mean a self-centering three-jaw chuck. The term <b>universal</b> <b>chuck</b> also refers to this type. These chucks are best suited to grip circular or hexagonal cross-sections when very fast, reasonably accurate (Â±0.005 inch mm TIR) centering is desired.|$|E
40|$|A CNC {{machining}} operation is {{the outcome of}} the application of the integrated capabilities of various resources within the CNC machining centre. Part fixtures, clamping and other location mechanisms are essential subsets of CNC machining resources. Today, various fixturing techniques and attachments available in the market allow manufacturers to enhance their production capability without buying expensive machine tools. This technology-rich fixturing domain is detached while representing and exchanging machine tool resource information for making manufacturing decisions. The research work in this article utilises the STEP-NC compliant unified manufacturing resource model (UMRM) for representing fixtures in conjunction with the parent CNC machining centre. Thus, UMRM is enhanced in this context to represent various fixtures such as <b>universal</b> vises, <b>chucks,</b> pallets and auxiliary rotary tables among others. The major contribution of this article is the application of the extension of the UMRM approach for representing fixturing domain, which allows generic modelling of fixtures and loading devices in addition to machine workpiece and process modelling. This would enable the stage of automated process planning and manufacturing. The universal approach in representing resource information allows the data to be utilised for making a wide variety of manufacturing decisions...|$|R
50|$|Similarly, Connecticut {{industry}} became {{well known}} in allied fields. Hardware and tools continue to be manufactured by Stanley Corporation in New Britain, despite having almost moved elsewhere for financial reasons. Connecticut was a major area for development and manufacture of machine tools. In 1818, Simeon North designed America's first milling machine. Machinist Elisha Root first designed machinery for the Collins Company of Collinsville which manufactured axes which became world-famous, then was hired by Colt in 1849 to modernize firearm production by designing precision drop hammers, boring machines, gauges, jigs, etc., and improving the milling machines designed by Francis A. Pratt for the George S. Lincoln company in Hartford; the resulting Lincoln miller became world-famous, selling over 150,000 machines. Another Colt engineer, William Mason, patented 125 inventions for manufacture of firearms, as well as steam pumps and power looms. Christopher Spencer invented the automatic turret lathe (which in its small- to medium-sized form {{is known as a}} screw machine) for machining screws, as well as the variable cam cylinder used to control the turret. Francis A. Pratt and Amos Whitney invented a thread milling machine in 1865; Whitney also perfected various measurement instruments, and Pratt designed the aforementioned original milling machine manufactured by the George S. Lincoln company of Hartford. Simon Fairman invented the lathe chuck in West Stafford in 1830, and his son-in-law, Austin F. Cushman, invented the self-centering Cushman <b>Universal</b> <b>Chuck</b> in 1862. Edward P. Bullard designed the vertical boring mill in 1883. Charles E. Billings perfected the drop hammer for metal forging in the 1870s and designed the copper commutator central to the operation of electrical generators and motors. Edwin R. Fellows of Torrington in 1896 designed and built a new type of gear shaper and founded the Fellows Gear Shaper Company, which made a vital contribution to the manufacture of effective and reliable gear transmissions for the nascent automotive industry. The name Bridgeport on machine tools continues to be a guarantee of high quality around the world, for people who have no idea that the machinery is named after a city in Connecticut. Even the world of toys was dominated by the A. C. Gilbert Company, manufacturers of Erector Sets as well as other educational toys such as chemistry sets, microscopes, toy trains, etc.|$|E
