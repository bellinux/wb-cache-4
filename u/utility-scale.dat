5|$|India {{has been}} rising up the leading nations for the {{installation}} of <b>utility-scale</b> solar capacity.|$|E
5|$|China was {{reported}} in early 2013 to have overtaken Germany as the nation with the most <b>utility-scale</b> solar capacity. Much {{of this has been}} supported by the Clean Development Mechanism.|$|E
5|$|The first {{places to}} reach grid parity were {{those with high}} {{traditional}} electricity prices {{and high levels of}} solar radiation. Currently, more capacity is being installed in the rooftop than in the <b>utility-scale</b> segment. However, the worldwide distribution of solar parks is expected to change as different regions achieve grid parity. This transition also includes a shift from rooftop towards <b>utility-scale</b> plants, since the focus of new PV deployment has changed from Europe towards the Sunbelt markets where ground-mounted PV systems are favored.|$|E
5|$|As {{the cost}} of solar {{electricity}} has fallen, the number of grid-connected solar PV systems has grown into the millions and <b>utility-scale</b> solar power stations with hundreds of megawatts are being built. Solar PV is rapidly becoming an inexpensive, low-carbon technology to harness renewable energy from the Sun. The current largest photovoltaic power station {{in the world is}} the 850MW Longyangxia Dam Solar Park, in Qinghai, China.|$|E
5|$|In its 2014 {{edition of}} the Technology Roadmap: Solar Photovoltaic Energy report, the International Energy Agency (IEA) {{published}} prices for residential, commercial and <b>utility-scale</b> PV systems for eight major markets as of 2013 (see table below). However, DOE's SunShot Initiative has reported much lower U.S. installation prices. In 2014, prices continued to decline. The SunShot Initiative modeled U.S. system prices {{to be in the}} range of $1.80 to $3.29 per watt. Other sources identify similar price ranges of $1.70 to $3.50 for the different market segments in the U.S., and in the highly penetrated German market, prices for residential and small commercial rooftop systems of up to 100kW declined to $1.36 per watt (€1.24/W) by the end of 2014. In 2015, Deutsche Bank estimated costs for small residential rooftop systems in the U.S. around $2.90 per watt. Costs for <b>utility-scale</b> systems in China and India were estimated as low as $1.00 per watt.|$|E
5|$|Solar One {{operated}} successfully from 1982 to 1988, {{proving that}} solar power towers work efficiently to produce <b>utility-scale</b> power from sunlight. The Solar One plant used water/steam as the heat-transfer fluid in the receiver; this presented several problems {{in terms of}} storage and continuous turbine operation. To address these problems, Solar One was upgraded to Solar Two, which operated from 1996 to 1999. Both systems had a 10 MW power capacity.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of Feed-in tariffs in the United Kingdom in 2010 stimulated {{the first wave}} of <b>utility-scale</b> projects, with c. 20 plants being completed before tariffs were reduced on 1 August 2011 following the 'Fast Track Review'. A second wave of installations was undertaken under the UK's Renewables Obligation, with the total number of plants connected by the end of March 2013 reaching 86. This is reported to have made the UK Europe's best market {{in the first quarter of}} 2013.|$|E
5|$|A {{photovoltaic}} power station, {{also known}} as a solar park, is a large-scale photovoltaic system (PV system) designed for the supply of merchant power into the electricity grid. They are differentiated from most building-mounted and other decentralised solar power applications because they supply power at the utility level, rather than to a local user or users. They are sometimes also referred to as solar farms or solar ranches, especially when sited in agricultural areas. The generic expression <b>utility-scale</b> solar is sometimes used to describe this type of project.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1990s, {{development}} of both, {{residential and commercial}} rooftop solar as well as <b>utility-scale</b> photovoltaic power stations, began to accelerate again due to supply issues with oil and natural gas, global warming concerns, and the improving economic position of PV relative to other energy technologies. In the early 2000s, the adoption of feed-in tariffs—a policy mechanism, that gives renewables priority on the grid and defines a fixed price for the generated electricity—lead to {{a high level of}} investment security and to a soaring number of PV deployments in Europe.|$|E
5|$|With the {{development}} of electric power, wind power found new applications in lighting buildings remote from centrally-generated power. Throughout the 20th century parallel paths developed small wind stations suitable for farms or residences, and larger <b>utility-scale</b> wind generators that could be connected to electric power grids for remote use of power. Today wind powered generators operate in every size range between tiny stations for battery charging at isolated residences, up to near-gigawatt sized offshore wind farms that provide electric power to national electrical networks.|$|E
25|$|Solar {{thermal power}} is {{generally}} <b>utility-scale.</b>|$|E
25|$|So far, Wells Fargo has {{provided}} more than $6billion in financing for environmentally beneficial business opportunities, including supporting 185 commercial-scale solar photovoltaic projects and 27 <b>utility-scale</b> wind projects nationwide.|$|E
25|$|According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, as of September 2014 <b>utility-scale</b> solar {{had sent}} 12,303 gigawatt-hours of {{electricity}} to the U.S. grid. This {{was an increase}} of over 100% versus {{the same period in}} 2013 (6,048 GWh).|$|E
25|$|The United States {{conducted}} much early {{research in}} photovoltaics and concentrated solar power. The U.S. {{is among the}} top {{countries in the world}} in electricity generated by the Sun and several of the world's largest <b>utility-scale</b> installations are located in the desert Southwest.|$|E
25|$|After the 2017 eclipse, grid {{operators}} in California reported having lost 3,000–3,500 megawatts of <b>utility-scale</b> solar power, {{which was made}} up for by hydropower and gas reliably and as expected, mimicking the usual duck curve. Energy demand management was also used to mitigate the solar drop.|$|E
25|$|Ocean Power Technologies, a {{renewable}} energy company, based in Pennington, New Jersey, is proposing {{to develop a}} <b>utility-scale,</b> commercial wave park in North America at Coos Bay. The planned size of this park is up to 100 megawatts, {{and it will be}} the largest wave energy project in the world when it is completed.|$|E
25|$|Wind {{power in}} Ohio {{has a long}} history, and as of 2012, Ohio had 426 MW of <b>utility-scale</b> wind power {{installations}} installed. Over 1000 MW more were under construction or pending approval. Some installations have become tourist attractions. There has been a sudden increase in generating capacity, as total windpower generation {{in the state in}} 2010 was just 9.7 MW.|$|E
25|$|Current trends {{indicate}} {{that a large number}} of photovoltaic power plants will be built in the south and southwest areas, where there is ample land in the sunny deserts of California, Nevada and Arizona. Large properties are being bought there with the aim of building more <b>utility-scale</b> PV power plants. In addition, many of the projects are on BLM public land.|$|E
25|$|Concentrator {{photovoltaics}} (CPV) is a photovoltaic {{technology that}} contrary to conventional flat-plate PV systems uses lenses and curved mirrors to focus sunlight onto small, but highly efficient, multi-junction (MJ) solar cells. In addition, CPV systems often use solar trackers {{and sometimes a}} cooling system to further increase their efficiency. Ongoing research and development is rapidly improving their competitiveness in the <b>utility-scale</b> segment and in areas of high solar insolation.|$|E
25|$|Over 30 GW of <b>utility-scale</b> {{photovoltaic}} {{power plants}} were under {{development in the}} United States in 2015. The largest is the 2,700 MW Westlands Solar Park, in Kings County, California. The Blythe Solar Power Project is a 485 MW photovoltaic station under construction in Riverside County, California. The 300 MW Sonoran Solar Project in Arizona, is a photovoltaic solar power plant that is being planned by a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources. Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar granted approval for the project in December 2011.|$|E
25|$|<b>Utility-scale</b> {{wind farms}} must {{have access to}} {{transmission}} lines to transport energy. The wind farm developer may be obliged to install extra equipment or control systems in the wind farm to meet the technical standards set by the operator of a transmission line. The company or person that develops the wind farm can then sell the power on the grid through the transmission lines and ultimately chooses whether {{to hold on to}} the rights or sell the farm or parts of it to big business like GE, for example.|$|E
25|$|A {{photovoltaic}} system, or solar PV {{system is}} a power system designed to supply usable solar power by means of photovoltaics. It consists of an arrangement of several components, including solar panels to absorb and directly convert sunlight into electricity, a solar inverter to change the electric current from DC to AC, as well as mounting, cabling and other electrical accessories. PV systems range from small, roof-top mounted or building-integrated systems with capacities from a few to several tens of kilowatts, to large <b>utility-scale</b> power stations of hundreds of megawatts. Nowadays, most PV systems are grid-connected, while stand-alone systems only account for {{a small portion of}} the market.|$|E
25|$|Section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code allows {{an income}} tax credit of 2.3 cents/kilowatt-hour (as {{adjusted}} for inflation for 2013) {{for the production of}} electricity from <b>utility-scale</b> wind turbines, geothermal, solar, hydropower, biomass and marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy plants. This incentive, the renewable energy Production Tax Credit (PTC), was created under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (at the value of 1.5 cents/kilowatt-hour, which has since been adjusted annually for inflation). In late 2015 a large majority in Congress voted to extend the PTC for wind and solar power for 5 years and $25 billion. Analysts expect $35 billon of investment for each type.|$|E
25|$|Many <b>utility-scale</b> solar farms {{have been}} {{constructed}} all over the world. As of 2015, the 579-megawatt (MWAC) Solar Star is the world's largest photovoltaic power station, followed by the Desert Sunlight Solar Farm and the Topaz Solar Farm, both with a capacity of 550 MWAC, constructed by US-company First Solar, using CdTe modules, a thin-film PV technology. All three power stations {{are located in the}} Californian desert. Many solar farms around the world are integrated with agriculture and some use innovative solar tracking systems that follow the sun's daily path across the sky to generate more electricity than conventional fixed-mounted systems. There are no fuel costs or emissions during operation of the power stations.|$|E
25|$|From 1974 {{through the}} mid-1980s the United States {{government}} worked with industry {{to advance the}} technology and enable large commercial wind turbines. A series of NASA wind turbines were developed under a program to create a <b>utility-scale</b> wind turbine industry in the U.S., with funding from the National Science Foundation and later the United States Department of Energy (DOE). A total of 13 experimental wind turbines were put into operation, in four major wind turbine designs. This research and development program pioneered many of the multi-megawatt turbine technologies in use today, including: steel tube towers, variable-speed generators, composite blade materials, partial-span pitch control, as well as aerodynamic, structural, and acoustic engineering design capabilities.|$|E
25|$|New Jersey {{leads the}} nation with the least {{restrictive}} net metering law, while California leads in total number of homes which have solar panels installed. Many were installed because of the million solar roof initiative. California decided {{that it is not}} moving forward fast enough on photovoltaic generation and in 2008 enacted a feed-in tariff. Washington state has a feed-in tariff of 15 ¢/kWh which increases to 54 ¢/kWh if components are manufactured in the state. By 2015, California, Hawaii, Arizona and some other states were lowering payments to distributed solar owners and instituting new fees for grid usage. Tesla {{and a handful of other}} companies were promoting household grid-tied batteries while some electric companies were investing in <b>utility-scale</b> grid energy storage including very large batteries.|$|E
25|$|Airflows {{can be used}} to run wind {{turbines}}. Modern <b>utility-scale</b> {{wind turbines}} range from around 600kW to 5 MW of rated power, although turbines with rated output of 1.5–3 MW have become the most common for commercial use. The largest generator capacity of a single installed onshore wind turbine reached 7.5 MW in 2015. The power available from the wind {{is a function of the}} cube of the wind speed, so as wind speed increases, power output increases up to the maximum output for the particular turbine. Areas where winds are stronger and more constant, such as offshore and high altitude sites, are preferred locations for wind farms. Typically full load hours of wind turbines vary between 16 and 57 percent annually, but might be higher in particularly favorable offshore sites.|$|E
25|$|Solar {{cells can}} be {{classified}} into first, second and third generation cells. The first generation cells—also called conventional, traditional or wafer-based cells—are made of crystalline silicon, the commercially predominant PV technology, that includes materials such as polysilicon and monocrystalline silicon. Second generation cells are thin film solar cells, that include amorphous silicon, CdTe and CIGS cells and are commercially significant in <b>utility-scale</b> photovoltaic power stations, building integrated photovoltaics or in small stand-alone power system. The third generation of solar cells includes a number of thin-film technologies often described as emerging photovoltaics—most of them {{have not yet been}} commercially applied and are still in the research or development phase. Many use organic materials, often organometallic compounds as well as inorganic substances. Despite the fact that their efficiencies had been low and the stability of the absorber material was often too short for commercial applications, {{there is a lot of}} research invested into these technologies as they promise to achieve the goal of producing low-cost, high-efficiency solar cells.|$|E
25|$|Solar {{power in}} the United States {{includes}} <b>utility-scale</b> solar power plants {{as well as local}} distributed generation, mostly from rooftop photovoltaics. As of the end of 2016, the U.S. had 40 gigawatts (GW) of installed photovoltaic capacity, having almost doubled in capacity from the previous year. In the twelve months through August 2017, utility scale solar power generated 49.0 terawatt-hours (TWh), 1.22% of total U.S. electricity. During the same time period total solar generation, including estimated distributed solar photovoltaic generation, was 72.1 TWh, 1.80% of total U.S. electricity. In terms of total installed capacity, by year end 2015 the U.S. ranked 4th in the world behind China, Germany, and Japan. In 2016, 39% of all new electricity generation capacity in the country came from solar, more than any other source and ahead of natural gas (29%). By 2015, solar employment had overtaken oil and gas as well as coal employment in the U.S. In 2016, more than 260,000 Americans were employed in the solar industry.|$|E
25|$|Photovoltaic arrays {{are often}} {{associated}} with buildings: either integrated into them, mounted on them or mounted nearby on the ground. Rooftop PV systems are most often retrofitted into existing buildings, usually mounted {{on top of the}} existing roof structure or on the existing walls. Alternatively, an array can be located separately from the building but connected by cable to supply power for the building. Building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) are increasingly incorporated into the roof or walls of new domestic and industrial buildings as a principal or ancillary source of electrical power. Roof tiles with integrated PV cells are sometimes used as well. Provided there is an open gap in which air can circulate, rooftop mounted solar panels can provide a passive cooling effect on buildings during the day and also keep accumulated heat in at night. Typically, residential rooftop systems have small capacities of around 5–10kW, while commercial rooftop systems often amount to several hundreds of kilowatts. Although rooftop systems are much smaller than ground-mounted <b>utility-scale</b> power plants, they account for most of the worldwide installed capacity.|$|E
25|$|Floating solar arrays are PV {{systems that}} float {{on the surface}} of {{drinking}} water reservoirs, quarry lakes, irrigation canals or remediation and tailing ponds. A small number of such systems exist in France, India, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Singapore and the United States. The systems are said to have advantages over photovoltaics on land. The cost of land is more expensive, and there are fewer rules and regulations for structures built on bodies of water not used for recreation. Unlike most land-based solar plants, floating arrays can be unobtrusive because they are hidden from public view. They achieve higher efficiencies than PV panels on land, because water cools the panels. The panels have a special coating to prevent rust or corrosion. In May 2008, the Far Niente Winery in Oakville, California, pioneered the world's first floatovoltaic system by installing 994 solar PV modules with a total capacity of 477kW onto 130 pontoons and floating them on the winery's irrigation pond. <b>Utility-scale</b> floating PV farms are starting to be built. Kyocera will develop the world's largest, a 13.4MW farm on the reservoir above Yamakura Dam in Chiba Prefecture using 50,000 solar panels. Salt-water resistant floating farms are also being constructed for ocean use. The largest so far announced floatovoltaic project is a 350MW power station in the Amazon region of Brazil.|$|E

The {{study found}} that the land-use footprint, given in square meter-years per megawatt-hour (m2a/MWh), was lowest for wind, natural gas and rooftop PV, with 0.26, 0.49 and 0.59, respectively, and followed by <b>utility-scale</b> solar PV with 7.9. For CSP, the footprint was 9 and 14, using parabolic troughs and solar towers, respectively. The largest footprint had coal-fired power plants with 18m2a/MWh.|$|E
500|$|The 230 MW Antelope Valley Solar Ranch is a First Solar {{photovoltaic}} project {{now owned}} by Exelon in the Antelope Valley area of the Western Mojave Desert. In September 2011, the project received a $646 million loan guarantee from the US Department of Energy, and its construction was estimated to generate 350 construction jobs and 20 permanent jobs. It features an innovative <b>utility-scale</b> deployment of inverters with voltage regulation and monitoring technologies, which will [...] "enable the project to provide more stable and continuous power". Electricity from the Antelope Valley Solar Ranch project will be sold to Pacific Gas & Electric Company under a 25-year contract.|$|E
