40|$|Animation {{or sound}} is often <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>user</b> {{interfaces}} {{as an attempt}} to improve users' perception and comprehension of evolving situations and support them in decision-making. However, empirical data establishing their real effectiveness on the comprehension of changes are still lacking. We have carried out an experiment using four combinations of visual and auditory feedback in a split attention task. The results not only confirm that such feedback improves the perception of changes, but they also demonstrate that animation and sound used alone or combined bring major improvements on the comprehension of a changing situation. Based on these results, we propose design guidelines about the most efficient combinations to be <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>user</b> interfaces...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In many {{applications}} and environments for mobile communication {{there is a}} need for reference free perceptual quality measurements. In this paper a method for prediction of a number of quality metrics is proposed, where the input to the prediction is readily available parameters at the receiver side of a communications channel. Since the parameters are extracted from the coded video bit stream the model can be <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>user</b> scenarios where it is normally difficult to estimate the quality due to the reference not being available, as in streaming video and mobile TV applications. The predictor turns out to give good results for both the PSNR and the PEVQ metrics. I...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{visualization}} framework called DAGView. The aim of DAGView {{is to produce}} clear visualizations of directed acyclic graphs in which every edge and the potential existence of a path can be immediately spotted by the user. Several criteria that users identified as important in a layout are met, such as underlying grid, crossings and bends that appear perpendicular. The main algorithm {{is based on the}} layout of directed acyclic graphs but can be extended to handle directed graphs with cycles and undirected graphs, taking into account user preferences and/or constraints. Important tasks that are <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>user</b> studies are performed efficiently within the DAGView framework...|$|E
