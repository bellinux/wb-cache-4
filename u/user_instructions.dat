40|$|Recently, the {{behaviors}} of library users have changed due {{to the development of}} electronic resources and computer technologies. Accordingly, use of web-based electronic resources is becoming more popular compared to a visit to the library. Therefore, efficient and easy use of electronic resources has become essential and libraries support users by providing <b>user</b> <b>instruction</b> programs. This study investigated the status of <b>user</b> <b>instruction</b> of medical libraries in Korea, and developed <b>user</b> <b>instruction</b> programs. A few medical libraries perform <b>user</b> <b>instruction</b> programs regularly with various subjects. For the development of the program, users who received education in <b>user</b> <b>instruction</b> programming in medical libraries were surveyed and interviewed. Results showed that the satisfaction levels regarding program content, methodology, and place were high, but the satisfaction levels for course length were low. Users responded that the <b>user</b> <b>instruction</b> program was helpful for library use, database use, and general information usage. Many questions regarding library use were asked, and interest in other courses was high. Users also emphasized repetitive education, as well as details divided by levels. Beginning in 2008, Yonsei University Medical Library has updated its <b>user</b> <b>instruction</b> program based on the results. This paper introduces the case of such a library that has made changes on their <b>user</b> <b>instruction</b> programs...|$|R

New developments in education and technology {{during the last two}} decades have affected <b>user</b> <b>instruction</b> and have led to the emergence of information literacy. Based on needs related to the rapid development of information technology and the evolving information society, librarians have begun teach-ing information skills to all types of users to ensure that they gain informa-tion fluency so they can become productive and effective information users both in the education environment and in the work environment. The number of publications related to <b>user</b> <b>instruction</b> and information literacy, like the field itself, show phenomenal growth during the past three decades as demonstrated by the fact that in 1973 twenty-eight publications were reviewed, and in 2002 more than 300 publications dealing with the topic of information literacywill be issued. It is noteworthy that in the last decade there has been a tremendous growth in publications related to information literacy globally. During the 1970 s,publications indicate that <b>user</b> <b>instruction</b> activities were of concern primarily to librarians in the United States, Cana-da, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand.

50|$|Most {{machines}} running Unix or a Unix-like {{operating system}} run the X Window System which almost always encourages a three-button mouse. X numbers the buttons by convention. This allows <b>user</b> <b>instructions</b> {{to apply to}} mice or pointing devices that do not use conventional button placement. For example, a left-handed user may reverse the buttons, usually with a software setting. With non-conventional button placement, user directions that say “left mouse button” or “right mouse button” are confusing. The ground-breaking Xerox Parc Alto and Dorado computers from the mid-1970s used three-button mice, and each button was assigned a color. Red {{was used for the}} left (or primary) button, yellow for the middle (secondary), and blue for the right (meta or tertiary).

5000|$|Primary {{concept and}} {{development}} work {{takes place at}} the Billund headquarters, where the company employs approximately 120 designers. The company also has smaller design offices in the UK, Spain, Germany, and Japan which are tasked with developing products aimed specifically at these markets. The average development period for a new product is around twelve months, split into three stages. The first stage is to identify market trends and developments, including contact by the designers directly with the market; some are stationed in toy shops close to holidays, while others interview children. The second stage is the design and development of the product based upon the results of the first stage. As of September 2008 the design teams use 3D modeling software to generate CAD drawings from initial design sketches. The designs are then prototyped using an in-house stereolithography machine. These prototypes are presented to the entire project team for comment and for testing by parents and children during the [...] "validation" [...] process. Designs may then be altered in accordance with the results from the focus groups. Virtual models of completed Lego products are built concurrently with the writing of the <b>user</b> <b>instructions.</b> Completed CAD models are also used in the wider organisation, for marketing and packaging.|$|E
50|$|Safety back-up device, this is {{the most}} {{important}} tool as it a provides a redundancy should an ascender, descender, working rope or anchor fail. It is attached to the safety (second rope) and designed to be kept as high as possible to reduce the distance fallen in the event of a fall. The safety devices usually relies on friction transferred to the safety rope by means of a cam. The Petzl Shunt, a recreational climbing device, has been used successfully for many years for the safety back-up because it is positionable by the user, allowing it to be high above them at the work site and thus providing optimum protection. Concern over potential misuse and lack of <b>user</b> <b>instructions</b> or support for its use by Petzl has led to the development of other devices, including the Petzl ASAP, the KONG Back-Up, the DMM Buddy Catch, the SafeTec Duck-R. Unlike traditional devices that rely on friction to absorb shock the ASAP relies on a toothed wheel and an rip-stitch single use shock pack and although has the advantage of self trailing it tends to creep below the user. The Duck-R is a beefed-up stainless steel Shunt-shaped device designed specifically for use in rope access. All devices are connected back to the harness by means of a lanyard, otherwise known as a cow's tail, and fastened to the lanyard by a screwgate carabiner.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Research {{shows that}} confidence-increasing {{elements}} in <b>user</b> <b>instructions</b> positively influence senior users' task performance and motivation. We added verification steps and personal stories to <b>user</b> <b>instructions</b> for a cell phone, {{to find out}} how seniors (between 60 and 70 years) perceive these confidence-increasing motivational elements. Verification steps allow users to check if a procedure was carried out correctly. Personal stories describe how a fictitious user succeeded in completing a procedure. Method: The plus-minus method was used. Participants were asked to place pluses and minuses in cell phone <b>user</b> <b>instructions</b> to indicate their positive and negative reading experiences, and to explain their choices afterwards. Results: Verification steps are regarded as other, common parts of <b>user</b> <b>instructions</b> by seniors. Nineteen out of 20 participants appreciate verification steps, and they mainly encourage providing these because they are expected to decrease doubts, and increase user confidence and satisfaction. Personal stories tend to stand out compared to other, common parts of <b>user</b> <b>instructions.</b> Thirteen out of 20 participants appreciate personal stories, which use is mainly discouraged for redundancy reasons, and encouraged for their expected positive effects on user confidence and motivation. Conclusion: The use of verification steps and personal stories in <b>user</b> <b>instructions</b> seems acceptable to seniors. As a next step, it seems worth it to test for effects of these motivational elements on usability, user confidence and motivatio...|$|E

40|$|Understanding <b>user</b> <b>instructions</b> {{in natural}} {{language}} {{is an active}} research topic in AI and robotics. Typically, natural <b>user</b> <b>instructions</b> are high-level and can be reduced into low-level tasks expressed in common verbs (e. g., `take', `get', `put'). For robots understanding such instructions, {{one of the key}} challenges is to process high-level <b>user</b> <b>instructions</b> and achieve the specified tasks with robots' primitive actions. To address this, we propose novel algorithms by utilizing semantic roles of common verbs defined in semantic dictionaries and integrating multiple open knowledge to generate task plans. Specifically, we present a new method for matching and recovering semantics of <b>user</b> <b>instructions</b> and a novel task planner that exploits functional knowledge of robot's action model. To verify and evaluate our approach, we implemented a prototype system using knowledge from several open resources. Experiments on our system confirmed the correctness and efficiency of our algorithms. Notably, our system has been deployed in the KeJia robot, which participated the annual RoboCup@Home competitions {{in the past three years}} and achieved encouragingly high scores in the benchmark tests...|$|E

40|$|For a long time, <b>user</b> <b>instructions</b> were {{considered}} as purely instrumental documents: Instructions had to enable readers to perform tasks with an accompanying device. And {{even though this}} still remains {{the main purpose of}} <b>user</b> <b>instructions,</b> views on how to accomplish this have changed over the years. The traditional view seemed to assume that when the instructions were correct, readers would automatically {{be able to use the}} accompanying device well (Moore, 1997). According to current views, the instructions should motivate readers to keep on reading once they have started doing so (Horton, 1997). This new approach to technical communication is being adopted by a vastly growing group of practitioners in the field, but relatively little research has been conducted so far to test for the effects of this approach. We executed a number of studies to test for the effects of motivational elements in <b>user</b> <b>instructions</b> (Loorbach, Karreman, & Steehouder, 2007, 2009).

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose the use (or re-use) of formal {{specifications}} {{for the development of}} user manuals and <b>user</b> <b>instructions.</b> We base our work on two observations. The first is that a considerable part of user manuals consist of series of <b>user</b> <b>instructions</b> that guide a user in the use of a device or a software application. The second is that the user interface in terms of user operations and feedback can often be described {{in the form of a}} finite state machine. In this paper we describe how model checking techniques can be used to derive automatically series of <b>user</b> <b>instructions</b> from the interface specification. The approach is illustrated by means of the specification of a well-known device such as a telephone which is then used to derive proper instruction sequences addressing relevant 2 ̆ 7 how-to 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 what-if 2 ̆ 7 questions about the operation of the system from a user point of view...|$|E
40|$|Literature {{shows that}} there are two views on how <b>user</b> <b>instructions</b> should stimulate the users’ {{motivation}} to read the instructions {{to be able to work}} with the accompanying device, system or program. Advocates of the first view state that users will be motivated by correct instructions that enable them to perform tasks effectively and efficiently. Promoters of the second view think that facilitating correct task performance is not enough to motivate users. They consider it a function of <b>user</b> <b>instructions</b> to facilitate positive experiences while performing tasks, and they expect that adding motivational elements would be beneficial. We conducted four studies to investigate the effects of motivational elements in <b>user</b> <b>instructions.</b> These studies were based on the ARCS model, which provides strategies focusing on four objectives – Attention, Relevance, Confidence and Satisfaction – to make instructions motivational. We measured the effects of motivational elements focusing on those objectives, on usability and on the users’ motivation and confidence. We particularly studied elements that were expected to promote confidence (e. g. personal stories). In general, the results of the studies show that confidence-enhancing elements positively affect the effectiveness of task performance and users’ persistence in trying to complete a task...|$|E
