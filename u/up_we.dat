We shouted like crazy to the operator through loudspeakers that he should stop, but he just kept going and didn't lift the shovel. Then it stopped and backed <b>up.</b> <b>We</b> ran to Rachel.

25|$|Pauker's {{testimony}} stressed that, {{during the}} electoral campaign, {{much of the}} formerly landless peasantry was becoming suspicious of the BPD. She attested that, in several counties in Moldavia, the absentee ballot was becoming a widespread solution {{among members of the}} latter social category ("Asked whom they would vote for, peasants answer: «We'll think about it some more» or «We shall not be voting»"). While disheartened by the government's apparent failure to provide help, they also dismissed the opposition's PNŢ, whom they saw as representative of the landlords and opposed to the land reform. According to Pauker, they predicted that the Groza cabinet had carried out a previous land reform only as a preliminary step to collectivization ("Peasants answer that in Russia as well, in the beginning the land was divided, then taken away and kolkhozy were set <b>up.</b> <b>We</b> have no convincing arguments against such objections from the peasants").|$|E

Turn to, to ‘shoot away’, pick up and store the catch and clean <b>up.</b> <b>We</b> worked bloody long hours. I think there were six deckies, four firemen, one engineer, one wireless operator and the master and mate. The galley was right aft with the mess room beneath. You would get your feed, climb down the hatchway to the mess room below. We would get {{a bucket of water}} from the galley to take to the forecastle where we bunked. By the time we got forward we would have only half a bucket of hot water to wash in but after a couple of days you didn’t worry about washing. You were wet through most of the time so it didn’t matter.|$|E

Somehow, the idea came up about how funny it would be to start a blog about bacon... I took it and ran with it."

500|$|In October 2006, Peter Berg was {{attached}} to direct Tonight, He Comes with production slated to begin in May 2007 in Los Angeles, the story's setting. Berg had been midway through filming The Kingdom {{when he heard about}} the film and called Michael Mann, who had become one of its producers. The new director compared the original script's tone to Leaving Las Vegas (1995), calling it [...] "a scathing character study of this suicidal alcoholic superhero". The director explained the rewrite, [...] "We thought the idea was cool, but we did want to lighten it <b>up.</b> <b>We</b> all did."

He stated, [...] "After that, trust me, when a gale came <b>up</b> <b>we</b> dropped the hook [...] We dropped the hook because they found out the big ones could sink." [...] Mark Thompson wrote, [...] "Since the loss of the Fitz, some captains may be more prone to go to anchor, rather than venturing out in a severe storm, but there are still too many who like to portray themselves as 'heavy weather sailors.'" ...|$|E

According to him he asked [...] "Why do you shoot us? We had our hands <b>up.</b> <b>We</b> are peaceful. What do you want from us?", one soldier replied [...] "I want you to leave. If you do not turn back, I have orders to shoot". Arriving ambulances started evacuating the injured when army opened fire again.|$|E

Pyromanias style was widely emulated, particularly by the emerging Californian scene. However, remarked Leppard's Joe Elliott, [...] "I don't know how anybody could confuse us with that lot.

[...] According to Canada's goaltender Ken Dryden: [...] "We didn't play our game at all. After they tied it <b>up,</b> <b>we</b> started playing a panic type of game.

[...] At the end of the game, Team Canada accidentally snubbed the Soviets by returning to the dressing room directly without shaking hands with the Soviets after the game.|$|E
500|$|While light {{comedy and}} satire might have {{established}} Yiddish theater as a commercially successful medium, it was Goldfaden's higher aspirations for it that eventually earned him recognition as [...] "the Yiddish Shakespeare." [...] As a man broadly read in several languages, he was {{acutely aware that}} there was no Eastern European Jewish tradition of dramatic literature – that his audience was used to seeking just [...] "a good glass of Odobeşti and a song." [...] Years later, he would paraphrase the typical Yiddish theatergoer of the time as saying to him: [...] "We don't go to the theater to make our head swim with sad things.

500|$|Hilda Solis is {{the third}} oldest of seven {{siblings}} (four sisters, two brothers) {{and grew up in}} a tract home in La Puente, California. She had to help raise her youngest siblings, and later said of her childhood: [...] "It wasn't what you would call the all-American life for a young girl growing <b>up.</b> <b>We</b> had to mature very quickly." [...] She graduated from La Puente High School, where she saw a lack of support for those wishing to continue their education, including a guidance counselor who told her mother that “Your daughter is not college material. Maybe she should follow the career of her older sister and become a secretary.” However, another counselor did encourage her to attend college, and even went to her house to help her fill out an application. She took her younger sisters to the library to get them to follow her lead.|$|E
500|$|However, {{because of}} the devastation caused in Haiti, these plans were postponed. Phillips said that Jones had called Lionel and said, [...] "this is what this song is written for, as a {{fundraising}} vehicle for causes, tragedies, catastrophes like this. Why don't we take over the process, call our friends, and actually do this?" [...] Lionel understood the urgency of Haiti, and in January 2010, {{it was agreed that}} [...] "We Are the World" [...] would be re-recorded to help benefit Haiti, similar to how the original recording helped famine relief in Africa. Richie commented, [...] "Unfortunately, sometimes it takes a hit record to make someone decide to save a life. I want this song to be the battle cry again.

500|$|Author Brandon Friedman, also {{a combat}} veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan, shared a similar view at VetVoice: [...] "The Hurt Locker is a high-tension, well-made, action movie that will {{certainly}} keep most viewers {{on the edges}} of their seats. But if you know anything about the Army, or about operations or life in Iraq, you'll be so distracted by the nonsensical sequences and plot twists that it will ruin the movie for you. It certainly did for me." [...] Friedman criticized the inaccuracy of the film's representation of combat, saying [...] "in real life, EOD techs don't conduct dangerous missions as autonomous three-man teams without communications gear ... Another thing you'll rarely hear in combat is an EOD E-7 suggesting to two or three of his guys that they leave the scene of an explosion in an Iraqi city by saying: 'C'mon, let's split <b>up.</b> <b>We</b> can cover more ground that way.|$|E

500|$|In 1741, the Austrian {{authorities}} informed Maria Theresa that Bohemian populace {{would prefer}} Charles Albert {{to her as}} sovereign. Maria Theresa, desperate and burdened by pregnancy, wrote plaintively to her sister: [...] "I don't know if a town will remain to me for my delivery." [...] She bitterly vowed to spare nothing and no one to defend her kingdom when she wrote to the Bohemian chancellor, Count Philip Kinsky: [...] "My mind is made <b>up.</b> <b>We</b> must put everything at stake to save Bohemia." [...] On 26October, the Elector of Bavaria captured Prague and declared himself King of Bohemia. Maria Theresa, then in Hungary, wept on learning {{of the loss of}} Bohemia. Charles Albert was unanimously elected Holy Roman Emperor on 24January 1742. The Archduchess, who regarded the election as a catastrophe, caught her enemies unprepared by insisting on a winter campaign; the same day he was elected emperor, Austrian troops under Ludwig Andreas von Khevenhüller captured Munich, Charles Albert's capital.|$|E
500|$|After English {{actor and}} comedian Russell Brand {{divorced}} Perry in late December 2011, {{she was so}} distraught over the event that she considered committing suicide. Greg Wells, who assisted Perry with the composition of [...] "By the Grace of God", commented on the situation: [...] "I think she felt so kicked {{in the head and}} so publicly embarrassed at being divorced by a text message". After overcoming her suicidal thoughts and initial shock, she felt prompted to create a [...] "darker" [...] project as compared to her previous albums. Instead, she channelled the entire divorce event into [...] "By the Grace of God", in which its lyrics depict Perry battling against her suicidal thoughts while lying on her bathroom floor. During an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Perry spoke on how she felt during the breakup: [...] "Imagine what you go through.

Harrison had positive memories of the period: [...] "I'd have to say with hindsight that Hamburg bordered on the best of Beatles times. We didn't have any luxury, we didn't have any bathrooms or any clothes, we were pretty grubby, we couldn't afford anything, {{but on the other}} hand we weren't yet famous, so we didn't have to contend with the bullshit that comes with fame." [...] McCartney was philosophical: [...] "Hamburg was certainly a great childhood memory. But I think all things are enhanced by time. It was very exciting, though I think it felt better to me a little later in our career, once we'd started to get a bit of success with the records." ...|$|E
