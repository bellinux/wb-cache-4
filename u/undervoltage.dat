40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Three-phase {{induction}} {{machines are}} widely used in South Africa for industrial, commercial and residential applications because of their simple construction and low maintenance. The manufacturers design these motors to provide their nameplate ratings when supplied with balanced sinusoidal voltages. However, the power system experiences unbalanced voltages, overvoltages, <b>undervoltages,</b> etc, which are seen at the motor terminals. The South African Electricity Supply Utility (Eskom) supplies the commercial and industrial systems with a line voltage range of 400 V +- 10 %. An Induction motor rated at 380 V or 400 V will therefore experience overvoltages or <b>undervoltages</b> depending on {{the location of the}} motor from the supply. Besides overvoltages and <b>undervoltages,</b> unbalanced voltages exist on the power system. The tolerable level of voltage unbalance on the South African three-phase networks is 2 %, and may be up to 3 % in the rural areas. In practice, induction motors experience a combination of overvoltages or <b>undervoltages</b> with unbalanced voltages. This affects motor life. NEMA has done research on induction motors operating under unbalanced voltages. They defined voltage unbalance and produced a derating curve, assuming the average voltage applied to the motor is equal to the rated voltage. The EEC has another definition of voltage unbalance based on the positive and negative sequence voltages. The IEC definition {{is referred to as the}} true definition. Two formulas that approximate the true definition also exist. An analysis was done in order to understand the implications of using these definitions of voltage unbalance in the South African power system. It was found that the NEMA definition and the true definition do not differ significantly below a 5 % unbalance. in order to estimate motor life when a motor is supplied with unbalanced voltages, in combination with over or <b>undervoltages,</b> electrical and thermal models were developed to predict the temperature. The electrical model was based on the positive and negative sequence equivalent circuits. The thermal model used, separated stator and rotor thermal circuits. The thermal parameters were obtained from simple tests rather than from motor design data. The predicted temperature values agree closely to the measured values. The interaction between the electrical model, thermal model and the thermal ageing equation were used to estimate motor life when the motor is supplied with unbalanced voltages, in combination with over or <b>undervoltages.</b> Motor life is reduced when the operating temperature exceeds the rated. In order to restore motor life, new derating curves were developed since the NEMA derating curve is limited to rated average voltage. Motor life can be restored by applying the new derating curves developed here...|$|R
40|$|The ever-growing {{penetration}} of low carbon technologies is causing important modifications of standard power flow patterns in electricity distribution grids. As a consequence, low voltage networks are frequently experiencing over- and <b>undervoltages,</b> {{resulting in a}} poor voltage quality at customers' premises. In this context, energy storage is deemed a key technology to meet power quality requirements. In this paper, a voltage control algorithm based on a receding horizon scheme is developed to operate the energy storage systems deployed in a low voltage network. The proposed procedure requires few measurements to forecast the future state of the network and anticipate possible voltage problems. The algorithm is applied to real data from an Italian low voltage network, consisting of demand and generation profiles which determine over- and <b>undervoltages</b> {{in the absence of}} voltage control.

In ICs, latchups are classified as internal (like transmission line reflections and ground bounces) or external (like signals introduced via I/O pins and cosmic rays); external latchups can be triggered by an electrostatic discharge while internal latchups cannot. Latchups can be triggered by charge carriers injected into chip substrate or another latchup; the JEDEC78 standard tests susceptibility to latchups.|$|E

50|$|Power {{management}} ICs {{are solid}} state devices {{that control the}} flow and direction of electrical power. Many electrical devices have multiple internal voltages (e.g., 5 V, 3.3 V, 1.8 V, etc.) and sources of external power (e.g., wall outlet, battery, etc.), meaning that the power design of the device has multiple requirements for operation. A PMIC can refer to any chip that is an individual power related function, but generally refer to ICs that incorporate more than one function such as different power conversions and power controls such as voltage supervision and <b>undervoltage</b> protection. By incorporating these functions into one IC, a number of improvements to the overall design can be made such as better conversion efficiency, smaller solution size and better heat dissipation.|$|E

By curtailing opportune loads, a smoother voltage profile can be obtained. The aim {{of this paper is}} to create a curtailment schedule that takes into account both the voltage profile along the line as well as the demands of the consumers.

40|$|Abstract: Steady state voltage {{problems}} in power systems are {{those associated with}} <b>undervoltages</b> resulting from increasing loads. Steady overvoltages can also arise when loads served by networks are reduced, and the problem can be exacerbated if lines supplying load centres are long. This paper reports on a study that was conducted {{to assess the impact}} of derating voltage of lines, by using step down transformers on the lowest load a network can accommodate without overvoltages. A program written in Python and using PSS/E to perform loadflows, was used to perform analyses at various load levels. The study showed that with derating transformers installed, voltages in the system were better, there was less reactive power flow, and active power losses were lower. Derating lines using step down transformers is therefore a potential solution for serving low load levels...|$|R
5000|$|A final {{consideration}} with loads {{is to do}} with power quality. In addition to sustained overvoltages and <b>undervoltages</b> (voltage regulation issues) as well as sustained deviations from the system frequency (frequency regulation issues), power system loads can be adversely affected by a range of temporal issues. These include voltage sags, dips and swells, transient overvoltages, flicker, high frequency noise, phase imbalance and poor power factor. Power quality issues occur when the power supply to a load deviates from the ideal: For an AC supply, the ideal is the current and voltage in-sync fluctuating as a perfect sine wave at a prescribed frequency with the voltage at a prescribed amplitude. For DC supply, the ideal is the voltage not varying from a prescribed level. Power quality issues can be especially important {{when it comes to}} specialist industrial machinery or hospital equipment.|$|R
50|$|Thermoelectric coolers {{typically}} {{can drop}} the temperature by about 40 °F or 22 °C below ambient temperature, or can raise it {{by at least}} that much; {{this is really a}} function of the effectiveness of the box' thermal insulation. Some better units even have digital thermostat controls. They do draw a significant amount of power, however, and can drain a non running car's battery so much so that it cannot start. Most electric coolers have an <b>undervoltage</b> shutoff at around 10 or 10.5 volts to prevent this. Many come with power adapters, which use an electronic transformer to convert AC mains or line voltage down to 12 volts, with a lighter-like socket for the cooler's cord to plug in. Some also have a crossover-connection device to reverse the current for heating service.|$|E
50|$|Power issues aboard MSTI-3, {{caused by}} lower-than-expected battery {{performance}} and {{complicated by the}} spacecraft entering a period of full eclipses during its orbit, forced mission controllers to begin deactivating on-board systems. This began with the infrared instruments on 29 October, GPS on 3 November, and the VIS instrument on 22 November. Even with these measures, an <b>undervoltage</b> event on 25 November caused the spacecraft to lose attitude control, delaying the start of deorbiting procedures. The first thruster burn took place on 2 December 1997 at 04:29:56 UTC while the spacecraft was over Hawaii, lasting 22 minutes 36 seconds and using 12.2 lb of propellant. Following the burn, additional power issues and oversaturated reaction wheels caused a loss of contact and vehicle control. Spacecraft command was reestablished by 3 December, though problems with star tracker point acquisition delayed establishment of attitude control until 11 December. Command sequences for the second and final burn had been pre-loaded onto the spacecraft, and were enacted that same day at 14:11:30 UTC. This burn was programmed to last 1 hour 40 minutes in order to burn the remaining 11.71 lb of propellant to depletion. It was predicted that the spacecraft would impact the Pacific Ocean approximately 45 minutes {{after the start of}} the burn, at around 14:56 UTC. While contact with the spacecraft was established by the Diego Garcia tracking station a few minutes after the burn started, no further contacts were made and radar observation confirmed that the spacecraft had deorbited.|$|E
50|$|To {{extend a}} DC motor’s service life, {{protective}} devices and motor controllers {{are used to}} protect it from mechanical damage, excessive moisture, high dielectric stress and high temperature or thermal overloading. These protective devices sense motor fault conditions and either annunciate an alarm to notify the operator or automatically de-energize the motor when a faulty condition occurs. For overloaded conditions, motors are protected with thermal overload relays. Bi-metal thermal overload protectors are embedded in the motor's windings and made from two dissimilar metals. They are designed such that the bimetallic strips will bend in opposite directions when a temperature set point is reached to open the control circuit and de-energize the motor. Heaters are external thermal overload protectors connected in series with the motor’s windings and mounted in the motor contactor. Solder pot heaters melt in an overload condition, which cause the motor control circuit to de-energize the motor. Bimetallic heaters function the same way as embedded bimetallic protectors. Fuses and circuit breakers are overcurrent or short circuit protectors. Ground fault relays also provide overcurrent protection. They monitor the electric current between the motor’s windings and earth system ground. In motor-generators, reverse current relays prevent the battery from discharging and motorizing the generator. Since D.C. motor field loss can cause a hazardous runaway or overspeed condition, loss of field relays are connected in parallel with the motor’s field to sense field current. When the field current decreases below a set point, the relay will deenergize the motor’s armature. A locked rotor condition prevents a motor from accelerating after its starting sequence has been initiated. Distance relays protect motors from locked-rotor faults. <b>Undervoltage</b> motor protection is typically incorporated into motor controllers or starters. In addition, motors can be protected from overvoltages or surges with isolation transformers, power conditioning equipment, MOVs, arresters and harmonic filters. Environmental conditions, such as dust, explosive vapors, water, and high ambient temperatures, can adversely affect the operation of a DC motor. To protect a motor from these environmental conditions, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) have standardized motor enclosure designs based upon the environmental protection they provide from contaminants. Modern software can also be used in the design stage, such as Motor-CAD, to help increase the thermal efficiency of a motor.|$|E

Since the impacts of WES and PVS are important in the distribution system voltage quality, we study these in this paper using new models with the probability density function of node voltage and the cumulative distribution function of total losses. We apply these models to solve the IEEE 33 distribution system to be chosen in IEEE standard database. We compare our method with the Monte Carlo simulation method in three different cases, respectively. In the three cases, these results not only can provide the important reference information for the next stage optimization design, system reliability, and safety analysis but also can reduce amount of calculation...|$|R

40|$|Energy storage {{systems may}} {{represent}} a viable solution to tackle over- and <b>undervoltages</b> arising in low voltage networks due to the increasing penetration of low carbon technologies. An algorithm for siting and sizing energy storage systems in radial low voltage networks was proposed in previous work.

In this paper, we discuss the sizing step of the aforementioned algorithm for a low voltage network featuring overvoltages due to the high penetration of photovoltaic generation. Since the considered decision problem is affected by uncertainty on photovoltaic generation, a scenario-based approach, coupled with suitable scenario reduction techniques, is analyzed. While this approach is useful to keep the computational burden affordable, we investigate whether the energy storage system sizes found after scenario reduction can guarantee the solution of overvoltages with a priori defined confidence level. This is done by testing the overall procedure on a real Italian low voltage network provided by the main Italian distribution system operator...|$|R

40|$|Electric quality {{problems}} associated with power interactions between distribution and industrial process control systems can be prevented. Surveys of large users that buy power at the transmission and distribution voltages turn up relatively few complaints {{about the quality of}} their incoming power, while surveys of small users connected at secondary voltages tum up numerous complaints about the quality of their incoming power. Three major changes in the characteristics of customer loads and power distribution systems have altered the nature of the power quality equation: (I) greater sensitivity of devices and equipment to electric power variations, (2) the interconnection of sensitive loads in extensive networks and automated processes, and (3) an increase in loads that use power electronics in some type of power conversion configuration [1][2]. This paper presents applications of the constant-voltage transformer (CVT) for mitigating the effects of electric service voltage sags on industrial equipment in an oil refinery.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the use of}} superconducting magnetic and battery hybrid energy storage to compensate grid voltage fluctuations. The superconducting magnetic energy storage system (SMES) has been emulated by a high current inductor to investigate a system employing both SMES and battery energy storage experimentally. The design of the laboratory prototype is described in detail, which consists of a series-connected three phase voltage source inverter used to regulate AC voltage, and two bidirectional DC/DC converters used to control energy storage system charge and discharge. 'DC bus level signaling' and 'voltage droop control' {{have been used to}} automatically control power from the magnetic energy storage system during short-duration, high power voltage sags, while the battery is used to provide power during longer-term, low power under-voltages. Energy storage system hybridisation is shown to be advantageous by reducing battery peak power demand compared with a battery-only system, and by improving long term voltage support capability compared with a SMES-only system. Consequently, the SMES/battery hybrid DVR can support both short term high-power voltage sags and long term <b>undervoltages</b> with significantly reduced superconducting material cost compared with a SMES-based system...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} finding the optimal configuration (number, locations, and sizes) of energy storage systems (ESSs) in a radial low voltage distribution network {{with the aim of}} preventing over- and <b>undervoltages.</b> A heuristic strategy based on voltage sensitivity analysis is proposed to select the most effective locations in the network where to install a given number of ESSs, while circumventing the combinatorial nature of the problem. For fixed ESS locations, the multi-period optimal power flow framework is adopted to formulate the sizing problem, for whose solution convex relaxations based on semidefinite programming are exploited. Uncertainties in the storage sizing decision problem due to stochastic generation and demand, are accounted for carrying out the optimal sizing over different realizations of the demand and generation profiles, and then taking a worst-case approach to select the ESS sizes. The final choice of the most suitable ESS configuration is done by minimizing a total cost, which takes into account the number of storage devices, their total installed capacity and average network losses. The proposed algorithm is extensively tested on 200 randomly generated radial networks, and successfully applied to a real Italian low voltage network and {{a modified version of the}} IEEE 34 -bus test feeder...|$|R

Like any distributed generation source or load, photovoltaic (PV) generation can impact the voltage profile of a distribution feeder, potentially driving the service voltage outside of acceptable ranges. However, distributed energy resources can also bring great opportunities to improve power quality and cost effectiveness of the current power grid. In this dissertation, we will examine different strategies to increase solar PV penetration while complying with voltage standards and maximizing economic benefits of PV systems. The dissertation {{is divided into three}} main areas. The first one covers our solar forecasting technology using sky imagery and proposes an improvement to the current cloud height calculation using a stereographic method with multiple sky imagers. These sky images are then used in the second part {{to assess the impact of}} solar variability on distribution feeders with high solar PV penetration. Quasi steady-state power flow simulations at different solar penetration levels and cloud conditions are forced by site-specific solar resource data obtained from high resolution sky imagery. The impacts of variable solar power on voltage fluctuations, high frequency and magnitude power ramps, and transformer tap operations will be considered. The final area investigates how smart solar PV inverters can resolve voltage issues on distribution feeders. Once reactive power injection by smart inverters is allowed, overvoltages during midday and <b>undervoltages</b> during the evening can be avoided given a sufficient number of smart inverters on the distribution feeder.
