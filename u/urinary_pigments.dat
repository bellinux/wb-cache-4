40|$|A biuret {{method has}} been {{developed}} which provides quantitative measurements of protein in normal urine without interference from drugs or pigments. This method is intended for use in monitoring clinical trials of new drugs-to detect nephrotoxicity. Protein is precipitated from duplicate samples of urine by addition of cold ethanolic phosphotungstic acid. The protein precipitates are separated by centrifugation and washed with ethanol. Protein {{from one of the}} duplicate samples is dissolvel in biuret reagent. Protein from the second sample is dissolved in an alkaline tartrate reagent which is identical to the biuret reagent, excepting that copper sulfate has been omitted. After 20 mm., the differential absorbance of the two samples is measured at 540 m. The limit of sensitivity for detection of protein in urine is 0. 5 mg. / 100 ml. The coefficient of variation of replicate analyses of protein in normal urine is 4. 2 %. The recovery of protein added to urine averages 103 ± 3 %. Analyses of urinary protein by the biuret procedure provide close correlation with measurements by an amido black staining method. Systematic search has failed to reveal interference from <b>urinary</b> <b>pigments,</b> compounds, or drugs which are normally or occasionally encountere...|$|E

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} {{for the production}} of a reproducible and reversible renal lesion in the rat by the intravenous injection of a relatively small amount of homologous hemoglobin (40 mg/ 100 g body weight). Production of the lesion is dependent on prior water deprivation and its severity is related to the degree of dehydration. Ether anesthesia, at the time of hemoglobin injection, predisposes to a severe and reproducible functional defect in the dehydrated rat. In contrast, injection of hemoglobin during pentobarbital anesthesia results in a significant lesion only sporadically. The functional evolution of the lesion has been characterized by inulin clearance measurements. Functional impairment occurs abruptly, within 1 hr after hemoglobin injection, and persists unchanged over the ensuing several hours. Some increase in inulin clearance rate is usually observed at 24 hr after injection, but severe functional impairment persists. Between 24 and 72 hr, a considerable increase in inulin clearance rate occurs, so that only moderate restriction of excretory function is present at the latter time. A further moderate increase in inulin clearance rate is apparent at 7 days after hemoglobin injection, but some reduction in function. persisted in all rats studied at this time. Hemoglobinuria is slight or inapparent in animals manifesting the most marked depression of excretory function, indicating that a severe renal lesion may exist in the absence of visible <b>urinary</b> <b>pigment.</b> Hemoglobinemia is evanescent at the dosage used in this study. These observations suggest that clinical acute renal failure secondary to hemoglobinemia may readily go unrecognized and that this may be a more frequent association than is now appreciated...|$|R
40|$|For {{the purpose}} of the {{therapeutic}} dissolution of urinary calculi it seems to be very necessary to clarify the organic components of them, the study of which has been scarcely reported. The organic components reported have been analyzed only by the methods of elementary analysis. Recently it's histochemical study has been also reported. The present paper reports the results of the qualitative analytical studies for the amorphous organic components of urinary calculi by the methods of biochemical analysis. 45 g of mixed powder of urinary calculi (from bladder 3, kidney 1 and mixed pieces of various calculi which were used for the previous experiments but the origin of them remains unknown) was extracted, each in a separated fraction, by agents in the following order successively: petroleum ether, ether, chloroform, alcohol, cold water, hot water, 1 % aqueous solution of HCl, 5 % that of NaOH and 5 % that of HC!. Then each of the extracts was treated by some chemical procedures such as distillation, vacaum distillation, neutralization, salting out and hydrolysis with HCI solution. All of these fractions were analyzed by usual biochemical qualitative methods as below. Tests for protein and amino acid: ninhydrin test. biuret test. Millon's test. Hopkis-Cole's test. Sakaguchi's test. Molisch's test. precipitation test by lead acetate, ferrocianide, picric acid, phosphotungustic acid, sulfosalicylic acid and alcohol. heat coagulation. saltion out by ammonium sulphate. Tests for carbohydrate: Benedict's test. Nylander's test. orcin-HCI test. diphenylamine test. Reduction test by Fehling's reagent. naphthoresorcin test. cysteine-H 2 S 04 test. Tests for lipoid: acrolein test. Salkowsky's test. precipitation test by cadmium chloride. Lieberman- Burchard's test. Tests for other components: Ehrlich's aldehyde reaction. Obermyer's test. Jaffe's test. murexide test. Diazo reaction. Schledinger's test. precipitation test by mercury acetate. color develop meant by ferric chloride. Weiss's test. combustion. test by adding NaOH or acetic acid. test of P and S after hydrolysis by acid. Next, for protein, polysaccharide (using the extracting method of Sauda and Egami's technique) and nucleic acid (using the Levene's extracting method) in the powder was specifically analyzed. As the results of the above tests it was detected that urinary calculi have amino acid, protein, derived protein, mucopolysaccharide with and without S 04, lecithin-like substance, animal gum-like substance and <b>urinary</b> <b>pigment</b> as the amorphous organic components...|$|R
40|$|Linear oligopyrroles are {{degradation}} products of heme, which is converted {{in the presence}} of heme oxygenase to bile pigments, such as biliverdin and bilirubin. These tetrapyrrolic oligopyrroles are ubiquitously present in biological systems and find applications in the fields of catalysis and sensing. These linear tetrapyrrolic scaffolds are further degraded into linear tripyrrolic and dipyrrolic fragments. Although these lower oligopyrroles are abundantly present, their coordination chemistry requires further characterization. This dissertation focuses mainly on two classes of bioinspired linear oligopyrroles, propentdyopent and tripyrrindione, and their transition metal complexes, which present a rich ligand-based redox chemistry. Chapter 1 offers an overview of heme degradation to different classes of linear oligopyrroles and properties of their transition metal complexes. Chapter 2 is focused on the tripyrrin- 1, 14 -dione scaffold of the <b>urinary</b> <b>pigment</b> uroerythrin, which coordinates divalent transition metals palladium and copper with square planar geometry. Specifically, the tripyrrin- 1, 14 -dione ligand binds Cu(II) and Pd(II) as a dianionic organic radical under ambient conditions. The electrochemical study confirms the presence of ligand based redox chemistry, and one electron oxidation or reduction reactions do not alter the planar geometry around the metal center. The X-Ray analysis and the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies of the complexes in the solid and solution phase reveals intermolecular interactions between the ligand based unpaired electrons and therefore formation of neutral π-π dimers. In Chapter 3, the antioxidant activity and the fluorescence sensor properties of the tripyrrin- 1, 14 -dione ligand {{in the presence of}} superoxide are described. We found that the tripyrrindione ligand undergoes one-electron reduction {{in the presence of the}} superoxide radical anion (O 2 ●–) to form highly fluorescent H 3 TD 1 ●– radical anion, which emits at 635 nm. This reaction also explains the antioxidant properties of the linear tripyrrin- 1, 14 -dione ligand, which acts as a scavenger of O 2 ●–. In Chapter 4, the zinc binding properties of the tripyrrin- 1, 14 -dione ligand are described. The tripyrrolic ligand coordinates as a dianionic ligand with the divalent Zn(II) ion in both organic and aqueous buffered conditions. The complex formed is highly fluorescent with a long wavelength emission band at 648 nm. The X-Ray crystallography analysis indicates the existence of dinuclear complex [Zn(TD 1 ●) (H 2 O) ] 2, featuring a distorted square planar geometry around the Zn(II) center. In Chapter 5, the coordination chemistry of the dipyrrin- 1, 9 -dione fragment of propentdyopent ligand is shown with a series of transition metals like (e. g., Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II)), which form homoleptic tetrahedral complexes. The spectroscopic and electrochemical characterization confirms that the complexes shows ligand-based redox chemistry and acts as reservoirs for unpaired electrons. Chapter 6 describes the formation of the fluorescent BODIPY complex of propentdyopent ligand. The dipyrrin- 1, 9 -dione scaffold of heme metabolite propendyopent undergoes a one-pot reaction with borontrifluoride etherate in toluene to form a green fluorescent [(pdp) BF 2] complex. Spectroscopic studies reveal that the meso-unsubstituted [(pdp) BF 2] complex is stable in tetrahydrofuran and has a quantum yield of 0. 13. Electrochemical studies confirm that the complex undergoes ligand-based reduction and acts as a host for an unpaired electron...|$|R
40|$|A simple, rapid, precise, and {{accurate}} method is described for the simul-taneous and quantitative determination of conjugated and unconjugated chlorpromazine metabolites in urine.

Absorbance is measured at 422, 530, 565, and 700 nm, and concentration of metabolites is calculated by substituting values obtained in appropriate equations.

40|$|Najjar and Holt (1, 2) have {{demonstrated}} that their fluorescent <b>urinary</b> <b>pigments,</b> F 1 and F 2, are related to nicotinic acid metabolism {{in such a way}} that their estimation in urine is of diagnostic use in human pellagra (1) and in canine black tongue (1, 2). As nicotinic acid deficiency pro-gresses, the daily excretion of F 1, starting from a low level, slowly rises and then falls again; and the daily excretion of F 2, starting from a normal level, falls progressively to zero. Vigorous treat-ment of pellagrins with nicotinamide causes, within 3 days, a large increase in F 2 and a de-crease in F 1. Extending this work, Holt and Najjar (3, 4, 5) proposed the routine measurement of urinary F 2 in nutritional surveys as an indica-tion of the nicotinic acid content of the body. They state that when F 2 is absent in urine col-lected in the post-absorptive state, 3 the patient's stores of nicotinic acid are low. Oral administra-tion of nicotinamide to normal subjects in a good nutritional state leads to a prompt increase in F 2, maximal in 2 to 4 hours and subsiding to normal within 6 hours. Coulson and his co-workers (6) have also made a detailed study of the effects of various nicotinic acid derivatives on urinary F 2 estimations. Their results are much the same as those of Najjar and Holt.

40|$|Previous {{investigators}} {{have found that}} complete occlusion of the ureter may lead either to hydronephrosis or to atrophy. In Lindemann's series of six dogs;, for instance: Two animals showed simple hydronephrosis, three animals showed simple atrophy, and in one animal the kidney was slightly enlarged and the ureter and pelvis dilated, but fluid was absent. In his series of four rabbits, all showed hydronephrosis. The result, whether hydronephrosis or atrophy, is evidently not determined by the time elapsing after the operation. Lindemann found that the intrapelvic pressure resulting from the ligation obliterates the lumen of the vessels, first of the veins and subsequently of the arteries; but that this is compensated by an increase of the collateral blood supply through the capsule, the degree of this compensation determining {{the presence or absence}} of hydronephrosis. If the blood supply is free, the fluid after tapping will accumulate again and again. It is somewhat remarkable that all of our dogs showed hydronephrosis after the first operation. The results of establishing a urinary fistula differed in the two cases in which it was tried: The fluid did not re-form in Dog 3 even when sodium sulphate was injected: whereas in Dog 4, a very abundant quantity of fluid reaccumulated spontaneously; but it differed notably in composition from the original fluid, having more the character of a purulent inflammatory exudate. The histological changes consist in necrosis of the renal cells, obliteration of the glomeruli, increase of connective tissue, and endarteritis and periarteritis. Different areas in the same kidney are affected in very different degree, some areas appearing almost normal. The glomeruli are generally less altered than the tubules. The collecting tubules are generally displaced so as to run parallel to the surface; many are dilated. The changes correspond closely to those described by Lindemann. The sound kidneys showed slight hyperaemia and hypertrophy, but no necrosis. This corresponds with the findings of Pearce and of Ames. The uniformity in chemical composition of the fluid obtained, after the first operation, from the four dogs, as shown by Column III of Table I, is very striking, and points to a uniform origin by a process which is but little affected by the interval elapsing after the operation. The specific gravity, total solids and proteids correspond to those of a very dilute lymph, being but a trifle above those of cerebro-spinal fluid and aqueous humor, and much lower than those of serum, lymph and most cystic fluids (the proteid content of the latter being generally from 2 to 6. 5 per cent.). The human fluid (Column II) which had remained in the kidney for a very long time had a particularly low proteid percentage; while that of the second fluid of Dog 4 (Column VIII) was very much higher; this last fluid having a pronounced inflammatory character and being of recent formation. The absence of notable amounts of the specific urinary constituents is particularly important. 4 Odorous principles are entirely absent. <b>Urinary</b> <b>pigments</b> appear to be present in the four dogs' urines, but absent from the human case, 5 and after the second operation in case of the dogs. It seems fair to assume that the pigments were secreted shortly after the ligation, when the kidneys were still functional, and that they were reabsorbed with extreme slowness. Urea was present in all the fluids, but its quantity was very small in the dogs, and probably in the human case. It is on the whole somewhat greater than in the serum (0. 103 per cent., in place of 0. 05 per cent.), but the difference may be within the analytical error. The same applies to the ammonia, phosphates and sulphates. An important difference between these fluids on the one hand and blood serum, lymph and ordinary exudate on the other, lies in the higher contents of chlorid, and the consequently greater molecular concentration. The ordinary chlorid content of body fluid varies between 0. 55 and 0. 70 per cent., mean about 0. 6 per cent (as NaCl), while that of the first kidney fluid, in the dogs, varied between 0. 68 and 0. 75 per cent., mean 0. 725 per cent.; that of the human fluid was 0. 83 per cent., that of the second fluid of Dog 4 only 0. 52 per cent. The depression of the freezing point in the human case was 0. 715 ° C., as against the normal value, for human serum, of 0. 491 to 0. 562. (Possibly the blood of this patient had a higher concentration than normal, since uræmia existed.) The high chlorid percentage has evidently no relation to the length of time during which the fluid sojourned in the kidney. It is probably to be explained by the relatively slow absorption of this ion from the kidney pelvis. It is also to be remarked that cerebrospinal fluids generally have a somewhat high chlorid content (0. 573 and 0. 6 per cent.), but this never reaches the height of these ureteral fluids...|$|E
40|$|A {{scheme is}} {{described}} for the systematic screening for amino acids and sugars in urine. High-voltage electrophoresis {{is used to}} separate amino acids, and thin-layer chromatographyis used for sugar separation. In each case the separated constituents are stained and scanned in a densitometer, and a profile is constructed for comparison against normal profiles. A SAMPLE OF URINE is usually obtained for analysis in the laboratory when a patient is admitted to the hospital. The conventional examina-tion consists of measurement of specific gravity and pH; microscopic examination for cells, casts, and other formed elements; and examina-tion for glucose, protein, ketones, and hemoglobin by a simple dipstick procedure. In many instances, the urine is not collected with enough care to prevent spurious findings, and consequently the value of screening may be lost. If it is performed carefully, routine urinalysis is of value in the detection of diabetes, diseases of the kidneys and urinary tract, certain diseases of the liver, and metabolic disorders. Using the conventional procedures for urinalysis, we investigated the incidence of abnormal findings in urine samples obtained from 460 patients within 3 days of each patient’s admission to the hospital. One-third of the urine samples showed some abnormality. Both chemical and microscopic examinations are required to detect all abnormal samples as depicted in Table 1.

40|$|Background: Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is {{characterized}} by anemia, thrombocytopenia, neurological and renal involvement of variable severity {{and it has a}} dismal prognosis. Platelet-derived von Willebrand Factor-cleaving metalloprotease ADAMTS- 13 activity may orient the diagnosis, but normal levels do not discard it. The most effective therapy thus known is plasmapheresis. Aim: To report the experience in 18 patients with TTP. Material and methods: Retrospective assessment of 11 patients and prospective assessment of seven subjects with TTP, aged 15 to 81 years. Results: All presented with anemia, thrombocytopenia and LDH elevation. Sixteen had neurological symptoms, five had fever, four had macroscopic <b>urinary</b> excretion of <b>pigments,</b> four had petechiae, and two had nosebleeds. Haptoglobin was low in 10 of 11 patients in whom it was measured. ADAMTS- 13 had low activity in 15 of 17 patients (in 11, the inhibitor was found). Seventeen patients were treated with plasmapheresis and nine received steroids also. Seven patients died due to shock with respiratory involvement or múltiple organic failure. Conclusions: TTP has heterogeneous modes of presentation. If the diagnosis is strongly suspected, plasmapheresis can be started without laboratory confirmation.
