40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the issue of}} the contemporary Danish biographical novel, its identity and condition on the example of Peer Hultberg’s work on Chopin’s childhood, Preludes.

As expected, the Preludes does not meet any of the above expectations towards a biographical novel, which proves that the work can be recognized as a postmodernist literary biography.

Conclusions — Since neither citation-based impact metrics nor alternative metrics can be considered open, it seems necessary to draw up a list of criteria for open metrics.

We studied the efficacy of naftopidil an alpha 1 -adrenoreceptor antagonist used for treatment of BPH for improvement of nocturia and consequent sleep disturbance. Twenty-five patients diagnosed with BPH were administered daily oral doses of naftopidil (50 or 75 mg/day) for eight weeks. The symptoms were assessed quantitatively <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>criteria</b> : International Prostate Symptoms Score (I-PSS), QOL index, frequency volume chart, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). After treatment, the mean±SD of total I-PSS and nocturia decreased from 16. 9 ± 5. 2 to 10. 3 ± 4. 9 (p＜ 0. 001) and 3. 5 ± 1. 2 to 2. 3 ± 1. 3 (p＜ 0. 001), respectively.

40|$|To {{study the}} effects of stand {{development}} and overstory composition on stand age structure, we sampled 32 stands representing conifer, mixedwood, and hardwood stand types, ranging in ages from 72 to 201 years on upland mesic sites in northwestern Ontario. We defined the stages of stand development as: stem exclusion/canopy transition, canopy transition, canopy transi tion/gap dynamics, and gap dynamics. Stand age structure of conifer stands changed from bimodal, bimodal, reverse-J, and bimodal, respectively, through the stages of stand development. Mixedwood and hardwood stands revealed similar trends, with the exception of missing the ca nopy transition/gap dynamic stage in mixedwoods. Canopy transition/gap dynamic stage in hardwoods showed a weaker reverse-J distribution than their conifer counterparts. The results suggest that forest management activities such as partial and selection harvesting and seed-tree systems may diversify standard landscape-level age structures and benefit wildlife, hasten the onset of old-growth, and create desired stand age structures. We also recommend that the determination of old-growth <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>criteria</b> in the boreal forest: 1) canopy break down of pioneering cohort is complete and stand is dominated by later successional tree species, and 2) stand age structure is bimodal, with dominating canopy trees that fall within a rel atively narrow range of age and height classes and a sig nificant amount of understory rege neration. </p...|$|E

40|$|As oil-prices and {{environmental}} concerns are increasing, {{it is of}} interest to better use the well-head gas. This light fraction co-produced with petroleum is generally flared and in this paper a method for upgrading and returning the co-product to the petroleum stream is suggested. The method {{is based on a}} conversion of the gas to synthesis gas and upgrading this synthesis gas into liquid hydrocarbons. But as the placement of such systems would be remote, the design has been performed <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>criteria.</b> First of all the system has to be robust in design and secondly it has to be self-sustaining in that no additional feedstocks or chemicals are required for its operation and thirdly, the product should be crude oil compatible. In the paper, the system has been outlined, the major unit operations designed and heat and mass balances have been determined. Six cases have been compared, differing in reforming and oxygen generation technology. The comparison has been made on both a technical and production economic premises. In each case the investment cost has been determined and from this, and the calculated produced hydrocarbons, a production cost per barrel has been determined. The production of hydrocarbons well-head gas is a viable route and the production cost for the hydrocarbons vary between $ 71 and $ 156 a barrel, with the lower cost being quite attractive with the crude prices of recent years (around $ 100 a barrel). The production cost is however heavily influenced by the investment cost {{and the fact that the}} stranded natural gas is considered free.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundAn outcome {{measure to}} {{evaluate}} the neurological function of cervical myelopathy was proposed by the Japanese Orthopaedic Association in 1975 (JOA score), and has been widely used in Japan. However, the JOA score does not include patients’ satisfaction, disability, handicaps, or general health, which can be affected by cervical myelopathy. The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop a new outcome measure for patients with cervical myelopathy. MethodsThis study was conducted in eight university hospitals and their affiliated hospitals from February to May 2002. The questionnaire included 77 items. Forty-one questions, which were originally listed by the authors, were for evaluation of the physical function of the cervical spine and spinal cord. The Medical Outcome Study Short-Form 36 -Item Health Survey (SF- 36) was used to examine health-related quality of life (QOL). Patients with cervical myelopathy and healthy volunteers were recruited at each institution. After analysis of the answers from patients and volunteers, irrelevant questions <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>criteria</b> were excluded: (1) a question 80 % of answers for which were concentrated on one choice, (2) a question whose answer was highly correlated with that of other questions, (3) a question that could be explained by other questions, and (4) a question for which the distribution of the answers obtained from the patients was not different from that obtained from the normal volunteers. ResultsThe patients comprised 164 men and 86 women, and the healthy volunteers 96 men and 120 women. Thirteen items from the questions about the physical functions of the cervical spine and the spinal cord and 11 items from SF- 36 remained as candidates that should be included in the final outcome measure questionnaire. ConclusionTwenty-four questions remained as candidates for the final questionnaire.

We present the preliminary results of a prospective nonrandomized trial concerning the first HIV patient series receiving RAPA monotherapy after liver transplantation (LT). Since June 2003, 14 HIV patients have received cadaveric donor LT due to end-stage liver disease (ESLD) associated or not associated with hepatocellular carcinoma, scored by the model for ESLD system. Patients were assessed <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>criteria</b> for HIV characterization: CD 4 T-cell count more than 100 /mL and HIV-RNA levels less than 50 copies/mL. Primary immunosuppression was based on calcineurin inhibitors (CI), whereas switch to RAPA monotherapy occurred in cases of CI complications or Kaposi's sarcoma. Mean overall post-LT follow-up was 14. 8 months (range: 0. 5 - 52. 6). Six of 14 patients were administered RAPA monotherapy. Mean preswitch period from CI to RAPA was 67 days (range: 10 - 225 days). Mean postswitch follow-up was 11. 9 months (range: 2 - 31 months). All patients were affected by ESLD, which was associated with hepatocellular carcinoma in seven patients. ESLD occurred due to hepatitis C virus (HCV) -related hepatopathy for nine patients, hepatitis B virus-related hepatopathy for one patient, and hepatitis B virus-HCV hepatopathy for four patients.
