50|$|A company cannot own itself. The {{possession}} of treasury shares {{does not give}} the company the right to vote, to exercise preemptive rights as a shareholder, to receive cash dividends, or to receive assets on company liquidation. Treasury shares are {{essentially the same as}} unissued capital and no one advocates classifying <b>unissued</b> <b>share</b> capital as an asset on the balance sheet, as an asset should have probable future economic benefits. Treasury shares simply reduce ordinary share capital.|$|E
50|$|A pivotal {{point in}} Woolworths' history came after World War II, {{when the company}} {{established}} its relationship with Marks & Spencer (M&S) of London. Sonnenberg and Sir Simon Marks, son of the M&S founder, became good friends which led to M&S buying all <b>unissued</b> <b>share</b> capital of Woolworths in 1947. Later, David Susman, Woolworths' managing director, married Ann Laski, Lord Marks' niece. David Susman became a non-executive director of M&S, a position he held for nearly 30 years. Although M&S ultimately sold its shares of Woolworths, the two companies maintained close personal ties {{as well as a}} formal technology agreement.|$|E
50|$|<b>Unissued</b> <b>shares</b> can {{be issued}} {{at any time}} by the {{directors}} using a Form SH01 - Return of Allotment of Shares (Pursuant to Companies Act, 2006) subject to prior authorisation by the shareholders.|$|R
50|$|In a stock lock-up, {{the bidder}} {{is able to}} either {{purchase}} 1) authorized but <b>unissued</b> <b>shares</b> of the major or controlling stockholder, or 2) the shares {{of one or more}} large stockholders. The acquirer holds the option to exercise the shares at a higher price in the event of sale to a higher bidder, or to vote in favor of the acquirer’s bid.|$|R

(2) The {{share premium}} account may be applied by the company in paying up <b>unissued</b> <b>shares</b> to be allotted to members as fully paid bonus shares, or in writing off- (a) the company's {{preliminary}} expenses; or (b) the expenses of, or the commission paid or discount allowed on, any issue of shares or debentures of the company, or (c) in providing for the premium payable on redemption of debentures of the company.|$|R
5000|$|Woolworths Holdings Limited (...) is a South African {{chain of}} retail stores {{and one of}} the largest in the country, {{modelled}} on Marks & Spencer of the United Kingdom. This relationship with Britain's Marks and Spencer was formed after the Second World War, which led to the retailer buying all of the <b>unissued</b> <b>share</b> capital of Woolworths in 1947. These shares were later sold, but close ties still remain. The first Woolworths store opened in The Old Royal Hotel in Cape Town in October 1931. It was founded by Max Sonnenberg assisted by his son Richard and Fred Kossuth.|$|E
5000|$|A Special Resolution passed 28 November 1934 (confirmed 7 December) {{led to the}} devaluing {{of company}} shares. It decreed, [...] "That the Capital of the Company be reduced from £50,000, divided into 5,000 shares of £10 each, to £29,350, divided into 4,130 issues shares of £5 each (fully paid up)and 870 <b>unissued</b> <b>shares</b> of £10 each, and that such {{reduction}} shall be effected by returning to the Holders of the said 4,130 issued shares capital {{in excess of the}} wants of the company to the extent of £5 per share and by reducing the nominal value of each of the said 4,130 shares from £10 to £5." [...] It also stated, [...] "That immediately upon the aforesaid reduction of capital taking effect (a) each of the 4,130 issued shares of £5 each (fully paid up), (b) each of the 870 <b>unissued</b> <b>shares</b> of £10 each be divided into 10 shares of £1 each and (c) the capital of the company be increased from £29,350 (resulting from such reduction) to £50,000 by the creation of 20,650 shares of £1 each." [...] The legal papers from HM Court of Justice, Manchester, confirming the devaluing of shares and including a complete list of shareholders, were completed on 14 February and 1 March 1935.|$|R
50|$|For example, {{a company}} can file a shelf {{registration}} statement with a prospectus for 100,000,000 shares, $1,000,000,000 face value of bonds, $500,000,000 face value of convertible bonds, 50,000,000 Series A warrants, and 50,000,000 Series B warrants. These five different classes or series of securities are offered in a single document. The company may offer to sell all of them, none of them, or any part of some class. It can sell 30,000,000 shares at one time and another 50,000,000 a year later (it will then have 20,000,000 <b>unissued</b> <b>shares</b> covered by the shelf prospectus).|$|R
50|$|CNG {{published}} the Penrith Observer with a 5500 weekly circulation. The chairman Sir John Burgess (as he later became) also had 10.67% {{of the shares}} in CWHNP since 1968. Under the constitution CNG had negotiated special rights which it had bargained for in return for closing down a competing paper, the Cumberland Herald, when it had joined, and for acting as CWHNP’s advertising agent. It {{had the right to}} preferences on <b>unissued</b> <b>shares</b> (article 5) to not be subject to have a transfer of shares to it refused by the directors (article 7) pre emption rights (article 9) and the right to appoint a director if shareholding remained above 10% (article 12). The CWHNP directors wanted to cancel CNG’s special rights. CNG argued they were class rights that could only be varied with its consent.|$|R
500|$|Meanwhile, {{efforts to}} stop the merger were stepped up at Reading by Roger Smee, a former Reading player, {{born and raised in}} the town, who had become a millionaire in the {{construction}} industry. Smee, who strongly opposed the merger plan, had read the club's accounts the previous year, and so was aware of how the team's stock was allocated. He knew that Waller and his boardroom allies, Leslie Davies and John Briggs, had not held a controlling interest in the club in 1982 and that a large number of Reading shares had then been noted as unissued. His interest was therefore piqued when the Thames Valley Royals deal was declared [...] "irrevocable" [...] on the basis that Waller's faction controlled the majority of the shares in Reading. [...] "A year ago they didn't have a majority," [...] Smee later said, [...] "so how on earth have they issued these shares to themselves while Reading was a public company? That would be against the law." [...] Smee contacted Roy Tranter, a director at Reading who opposed the merger, and Tranter's legal team filed a complaint with the High Court objecting to the sale of the <b>unissued</b> <b>shares.</b>|$|R
500|$|Reading {{supporters}} marched {{from the}} town centre to Elm Park in protest against the merger before the team's match against Millwall on 30 April. Two days later, Oxford and Reading met at Manor Road in what the Glasgow Herald commented might be [...] "the last Thames Valley derby". Oxford fans held another protest march before the game, which Reading won 2–1. At the High Court on 3 May, Mr Justice Harman sided with Tranter and Smee, and handed down a new injunction forbidding trading in Reading stock until 13 June 1983. Following a Reading board meeting on 12 May, Waller, Davies and Briggs resigned their positions, and returned the disputed <b>unissued</b> <b>shares</b> to the club. The Reading Evening Post saw this {{as the end of}} the episode, and jubilantly bannered the news across its front page on 13 May: [...] "We've won! Merger off". The next day, Reading played Wrexham at home on the last day of the League season, needing to win to have any chance of avoiding relegation to the Fourth Division; they won 1–0, but still went down because of results elsewhere. The club held an extraordinary meeting of shareholders in July 1983, at which a vote was taken to decide between Maxwell's takeover bid and a rival offer from Smee, supported by Tranter. The latter proposition narrowly won, and Smee took over as chairman of Reading, putting an end to the planned merger.|$|R
6000|$|His fate {{hung in the}} balance, of that he {{was well}} aware. Either he must {{disregard}} Mr. Jackson's warning, confirmed as it was by many secret fears and instincts of his own, and say nothing except that he had failed in his mission, or he must take the bull by the horns and break with the firm. To do the latter meant not only {{a good deal of}} moral courage, but practical ruin, whereas if he chose the former course, probably within a fortnight he would find himself a rich man. Whatever Jackson and a few others might say in its depreciation, he was certain that the Sahara flotation would go through, for it was underwritten, of course upon terms, by responsible people, moreover the <b>unissued</b> preferred <b>shares</b> had already been dealt in at a heavy premium. Now {{to say nothing of the}} allotment to which he was entitled upon his holding in the parent Syndicate, the proportion of cash due to him as a partner, would amount to quite a hundred thousand pounds. In other words, he, who had so many reasons for desiring money, would be wealthy. After working so hard and undergoing so much that he felt to be humiliating and even degrading, why should he not take his reward and clear out afterwards? ...|$|R
50|$|The Stanhope and Tyne Stanhope and Tyne Railway Company {{found itself}} in serious {{financial}} difficulty in a scandal in which the directors had been misrepresenting the profits of the company. This prompted shareholders in the Brandling Junction Railway to inquire into their own company's state of finances, and a Committee of Investigation was appointed on 6 May 1842. After a lengthy and exhaustive inquiry {{they found that the}} Brandling Junction Railway too was not paying its way, although annual accounts had been published stating the contrary. Dividends at 6% had been paid out of capital and {{it was found that the}} directors had been in the habit of misrepresenting the accounts at the end of the half-year, to give the appearance of a profit. As well as improper accounting, the directors had raised money for capital works on their personal bonds, subsequently vesting these in themselves and mortgaging to themselves the remainder of the <b>shares</b> <b>unissued.</b> Apart from the improper acquisition of shares, this resulted in an annual interest charge amounting to £16,460 in 1842. In consequence of these revelations the company's shares fell in the market upwards of 50 per cent.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two separate but broadly related essays investigating the role of authorized shares in corporate events. In the first essay, I examine the relation between management`s power to issue new shares of stock and stock split abnormal announcement returns. I posit that the mechanical reduction in excess authorized shares (EAS) caused by a stock split, decreases management`s power to issue stock. I argue that this results in lower agency costs and thereby increases shareholder`s value. After controlling for other factors, and consistent with my hypothesis, I find that the pre-split ratio of <b>unissued</b> authorized <b>shares</b> to total outstanding shares (Excess Authorized Ratio-EAR) is positively related to the abnormal stock split announcement returns. My analysis suggests nontrivial economic benefits accrue to shareholders from a reduction in management 2 ̆ 7 s power to issue stock and firms that have a higher pre-split EAR benefit the most. In the second essay, I investigate the role of top-up options granted by target managers to bidders in tender offers. A top-up option enables bidders to bypass target shareholder consent and allows for relatively fast execution of the tender offer. My evidence, from 456 tender offers announced during 2000 - 2012 suggests that deals with top-up options are detrimental to both bidder and target shareholders, when compared to tender offers without the top-up feature. This effect seems to be concentrated in the pre- 2007 period. After 2006 {{a large majority of}} tender offers include top-up options. I also find that the use of top-up options is negatively related to the use of lock-up options in the early period. In the later period of my sample, when lock-up options were no longer used in tender offers, toeholds are negatively related to the use of top-up options. Moreover top-up options increase the speed of deal completion and are associated with less hostility, higher target free cash flows, and higher termination fees. Overall, I conclude that the use of top-up options is most consistent with the anti-competitive hypothesis. ...|$|R
