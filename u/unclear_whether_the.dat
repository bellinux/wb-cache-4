5|$|Bales' lawyer, John Henry Browne, later {{stated that}} his client was upset because a fellow soldier had lost a leg in an {{explosion}} on 9 March. It is <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> bombing cited by Browne {{was the same as}} the one described by the villagers.|$|E
5|$|In his 1995 revision, Nelson {{refers to}} {{putative}} hybrids with A.dobsonii and A.apiculatus, citing the 1978 paper {{in which he}} published putative hybrids with A.dobsonii and A.forrestii. It is <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> reference to A.apiculatus is an error or a fourth putative hybrid.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> {{operations}} were successful, {{due to the}} complexity of their execution, poor weather, and lack of response from German forces. It is possible that they contributed to the overall confusion of D-Day as part of the wider Bodyguard plan.|$|E
50|$|It is <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> SSRIs affect <b>the</b> risk of suicidal {{behavior}} in adults.|$|R

50|$|It is <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> Zanabazar {{designed}} <b>the</b> Soyombo symbol {{himself or}} if it had existed beforehand.|$|R
5|$|It is <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> {{story of}} the Tree That Owns Itself began with the Weekly Banner article, or {{if it had been}} an element of local {{folklore}} prior to that time. The article's author writes that, in 1890, there were few people still living who knew the story.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} Persian troops present at Thermopylae is {{therefore}} as uncertain {{as the number}} for the total invasion force. For instance, it is <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> whole Persian army marched as far as Thermopylae, or whether Xerxes left garrisons in Macedon and Thessaly.|$|E
5|$|The opening {{theme is}} {{repeated}} throughout. The song lacks a traditional chorus, and the melody and lyrics are ambiguous about the opening stanza's {{position in the}} song; it is <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> song has just begun, is in the verse, or is in the bridge.|$|E
50|$|It is <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> or not <b>the</b> {{village was}} {{destroyed}} in the Sullivan Expedition of 1779.|$|R

50|$|It is <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> Sadamichi is <b>the</b> {{same person}} as Suganuma Sadamitsu (1542-1604), who served the Imagawa and Tokugawa.|$|R
5|$|A herd {{lives on}} the Rachel Carson {{component}} of the North Carolina National Estuarine Research Reserve, a series of five small islands and several salt marshes. There were no horses at the Sanctuary until the 1940s. It is <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> Bankers swam over from nearby Shackleford or were left by residents who had used the islands to graze livestock. They are owned and managed {{by the state of}} North Carolina and regarded as a cultural resource.|$|E
5|$|Constantine I {{completed}} {{the separation of}} military commands from the administrative structure. The vicarii and praefecti praetorio lost their field commands and became purely administrative officials. However, they retained {{a central role in}} military affairs, as they remained responsible for military recruitment, pay and, above all, supply. It is <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> duces on the border now reported direct to the emperor, or to one of the two magistri of the comitatus.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} services, the Congolese Air Force is {{not capable of}} {{carrying}} out its responsibilities. Few of the Air Force's aircraft are currently flyable or capable of being restored to service and it is <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> Air Force is capable of maintaining even unsophisticated aircraft. Moreover, Jane's states that the Air Force's Ecole de Pilotage is 'in near total disarray' though Belgium has offered to restart the Air Force's pilot training program.|$|E
50|$|It is <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> or not <b>the</b> {{family is}} monophyletic, and what its {{relationship}} to other catfishes might be.|$|R
50|$|Sources mention an Umar ibn Walid ibn Mughīrah, {{but it is}} <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> he was <b>the</b> son of Walīd.|$|R
50|$|The company {{issued a}} number of {{telegraph}} stamps which are of interest to philatelists. It is <b>unclear,</b> however, <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> stamps were ever used as only unused copies are known.|$|R
5|$|Much of the play's Protestant tones {{derive from}} its setting in Denmark—both {{then and now}} a {{predominantly}} Protestant country, though it is <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> fictional Denmark of the play is intended to portray this implicit fact. Dialog refers explicitly to Wittenberg, where Hamlet, Horatio, and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern attend university, implying where Martin Luther in 1517 first proposed his 95 theses and thereby initiated the Protestant Reformation.|$|E
5|$|R. Gordon Wasson {{recounted the}} details of these deaths, noting the {{likelihood}} of Amanita poisoning. In the case of Clement VII, the illness {{that led to his}} death lasted five months, making the case inconsistent with amatoxin poisoning (p.110). Natalia Naryshkina is said to have consumed a large quantity of pickled mushrooms prior to her death. It is <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> mushrooms themselves were poisonous or if she succumbed to food poisoning.|$|E
5|$|The pyramid was {{excavated}} at {{the beginning}} of the 20th century by two different teams who reported conflicting estimates regarding its size and number of subterranean chambers. No artefacts were found over the course of the excavations, and no trace of a burial could be found. For this reason, it is <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> pyramid was used to bury a pharaoh or was abandoned following the premature death of the king.|$|E
50|$|In summary, {{there is}} {{variable}} evidence that working patterns are {{a factor in}} the weekend effect; with nurse:patient ratio possibly being more important than physicians' pattern of working. It is <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> changing <b>the</b> patterns will reverse the effect.|$|R

50|$|It is <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> and how <b>the</b> vardarioi, {{administrative}} {{officials of}} Thessalonica in the tenth-eleventh centuries, known through their seals, {{are related to}} the Vardariotai.|$|R
5|$|Two {{months after}} the protests in Shifang, {{residents}} told the New York Times {{that there were no}} signs that the Sichuan Hongda project was being resuscitated, and that the city had been quiet since the demonstrations concluded. An executive with Sichuan Hongda told Caijing magazine on July 9 that it was <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> construction for copper plant would go forward in the future, and whether it would be located in Sichuan province.|$|E
5|$|Worcester was {{an urban}} castle, built within an {{existing}} settlement. Many such castles required the clearance of local properties, but unusually at Worcester Castle the ditch {{of the outer}} bailey cut through part of Worcester Cathedral's cemetery. It is <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> cemetery was still in use at that time, but the desecration resulted in Ealdred, the Archbishop of York, with extensive interests in Worcester, complaining about the seizure {{of the land and}} formally cursing Urse.|$|E
5|$|According to Croatian {{political}} scientist Vladimir Filipović, it is <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> limited resources earmarked {{for the operation}} and the unclear motivation of CANBAT 1 troops would stop several HV brigades; according to Hague, the plan did not indicate how CANBAT 1 or the {{other elements of the}} UNPROFOR would retreat through Croatia after such a clash. Hague questioned the feasibility of Operation Backstop, because the advance-warning requirement was considered impossible to meet. The UNPROFOR had no reliable military intelligence on HV movements outside the UNPAs, or beyond -wide zones around the UNPAs (where only United Nations Military Observers were present). However, Hague considered Operation Backstop a deterrent.|$|E
50|$|Reactivated {{as part of}} the Air Force Reserve in 1947, it is <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> or not <b>the</b> {{squadron}} was manned or equipped. Inactivated in 1949.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of the population (60%) continued to support legalising brothels, but it was <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> they preferred <b>the</b> ALP or Coalition version of this.|$|R

5|$|Dr. George Spomer of the University of Idaho has {{discovered}} protocarnivorous activity and function in several glandular plant species, including Cerastium arvense, Ipomopsis aggregata, Heuchera cylindrica, Mimulus lewisii, Penstemon attenuata, Penstemon diphyllus, Potentilla glandulosa var. intermedia, Ribes cereum, Rosa nutkana var. hispida, Rosa woodsii var. ultramontana, Solanum tuberosum, Stellaria americana, and Stellaria jamesiana. These species {{tested positive for}} protease activity, though it is <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> protease is produced by the plant or by surface microbes. Two other species evaluated by Dr. Spomer, Geranium viscosissimum and Potentilla arguta, exhibited protease activity and were further examined with 14C-labeled algal protein for nutrient absorption activity. Both of these latter species displayed an ability to digest and absorb the labeled protein.|$|E
5|$|Emerald ash borer {{primarily}} infest and {{can cause}} significant damage to ash species including green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), black ash (Fraxinus nigra), white ash (Fraxinus americana), and blue ash (Fraxinus quadrangulata) in North America. In Europe, Fraxinus excelsior is the main ash species colonized by EAB. Ash susceptibility can vary due to the attractiveness of chemical volatiles to adults, or the ability of larvae to detoxify phenolic compounds. Emerald ash borer has also been found infesting white fringe tree in North America, which is a non-ash host, but it is <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> trees were healthy when first infested, or were already in decline due to drought.|$|E
5|$|In San Antonio de Béxar, Ugartechea asked Dr. Launcelot Smither, a Gonzales {{resident}} in town on personal business, to help Castañeda convince the settlers to follow orders. When Smither arrived on October 1, {{he met with}} militia captain Mathew Caldwell to explain that the soldiers meant no harm if the settlers would peacefully relinquish the cannon. Caldwell instructed Smither to bring Castañeda to the town the following morning to discuss the matter. At roughly the same time, Moore called a war council, which quickly voted to initiate a fight. It is <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> war council was aware that Caldwell had promised Castañeda safe passage to Gonzales the next morning.|$|E
50|$|Government {{newspaper}} Al-Ahram {{said that}} one of its offices, which is opposite to the hotel and base that were hit, was completely destroyed during the attacks. It is <b>unclear,</b> however, <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> office was a target of the assault or not.|$|R
50|$|A Martyrium of Saints Gereon, Victor, Cassius, and Florentius, martyrs of the Theban Legion {{used to be}} {{attributed}} to Helinand, but it is <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> he is <b>the</b> true author.|$|R
