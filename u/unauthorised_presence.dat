5|$|With {{effect from}} 27 June 2002, Pedra Branca was {{declared}} a protected area within {{the meaning of}} the Protected Areas and Protected Places Act. Consequently, a permit from the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore is required for access to the island, and <b>unauthorised</b> <b>presence</b> there is a criminal offence. On 6 October 2008, a Singaporean man, Roger Lee, was convicted of illegally landing on Pedra Branca. In court documents, he said he had gone to Batam, Indonesia, in 1998. He later married and started a family with an Indonesian woman, but she left him in 2007 due to his unstable income and inability to hold down a job. As he had illegally overstayed in Indonesia, and had been cheated of his passport and other personal documents by a friend, Lee hatched a plan to pretend to be a lost fisherman {{in the hope that the}} Police Coast Guard would rescue him and take him back to Singapore. On 5 February 2008 he paid a boatman to transport him out to sea in a motorised sampan. As he did not see any coast guard or navy patrols he disembarked on Pedra Branca and was arrested by staff stationed there. Lee pleaded guilty to illegally entering Singapore via an unauthorised landing place. A second charge of being found in a protected place without permission was taken into consideration for sentencing purposes. In mitigation, Lee's pro bono lawyer said that there was no sign on Pedra Branca warning against trespassing on the island. Lee was sentenced to six weeks' imprisonment.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{arrival in}} the Middle East in December 1914, the New Zealanders {{undertook}} further training, before {{taking part in the}} Landing at Anzac Cove as part of the Gallipoli campaign on 25 April 1915. The Otago Mounted Rifles Regiment (including the Southland Squadron) did not take part in the initial landing; instead they were sent as dismounted reinforcements the following month. It seems, however, that Travis, was not scheduled to proceed with rest of the Southland Mounted Rifles Squadron, presumably having been assigned to a rear detail or reserve party that was to remain in Egypt until called for later on. Nevertheless, exhibiting the same disregard for discipline that had gotten him in trouble earlier in his life, he took it upon himself to stow away upon the squadron's transport and joined them on the Gallipoli Peninsula. His <b>unauthorised</b> <b>presence</b> was soon discovered and disciplinary proceedings followed with Travis being returned to Egypt and receiving 14 days' confinement. Nevertheless, he was later able to return to Gallipoli {{to take part in the}} final month of the campaign before the Allied forces were evacuated in December 1915, and while at ANZAC Cove he established a reputation as a fine soldier who possessed the ability to move through [...] "no man's land" [...] unscathed.|$|E
50|$|The {{third phase}} of doctrinal {{development}} of Myanmar Armed Forces {{came after the}} military take over and formation of State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) in September 1988 as part of armed forces modernisation programme. The development was the reflection of sensitivity towards direct foreign invasion or invasion by proxy state during the turbulent years of the late 1980s and early 1990s, for example: the <b>unauthorised</b> <b>presence</b> of a US aircraft carrier Battle Group in Myanmar's territorial waters during the 1988 political uprising as evidence of an infringement of Myanmar's sovereignty. Also, the Tatmadaw leadership was concerned that foreign powers might arm the insurgents on the border to exploit the political situation and tensions in the country. This new threat perception, previously insignificant under the nation's isolationist foreign policy, led Tatmadaw leaders to review the defence capability and doctrine of the Tatmadaw.|$|E
