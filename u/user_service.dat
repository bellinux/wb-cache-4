50|$|Network Policy and Access Services (NPAS) is a {{component}} of Windows Server 2008. It replaces the Internet Authentication Service (IAS) from Windows Server 2003. NPAS helps you safeguard the health and security of a network. The NPAS server role includes Network Policy Server (NPS), Health Registration Authority (HRA), and Host Credential Authorization Protocol (HCAP). In Windows Server 2003, IAS is the Microsoft implementation of a Remote Authentication Dial-In <b>User</b> <b>Service</b> (RADIUS) server. In Windows Server operating systems later than Windows Server 2003, IAS is renamed to NPS.|$|E
50|$|Remote Authentication Dial In <b>User</b> <b>Service</b> (RADIUS) is an AAA (authentication, {{authorization}} and accounting) protocol {{used for}} remote network access. RADIUS was originally proprietary but was later published under ISOC documents RFC 2138 and RFC 2139. The {{idea is to}} have an inside server act as a gatekeeper by verifying identities through a username and password that is already pre-determined by the user. A RADIUS server can also be configured to enforce user policies and restrictions as well as record accounting information such as connection time for purposes such as billing.|$|E
40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the Space Station Freedom (SSF) program the concept of on-orbit <b>servicing</b> of <b>user</b> hardware has been {{an integral part of the}} program implementation. The <b>user</b> <b>servicing</b> system architecture has been divided into a baseline and a growth phase. The baseline system consists of the following hardware elements that will support <b>user</b> <b>servicing</b> - flight telerobotic servicer, crew and equipment translation aid, crew intravehicular and extravehicular servicing support, logistics supply system, mobile servicing center, and the special purpose dextrous manipulator. The growth phase incorporates a customer servicing facility (CSF), a station-based orbital maneuvering vehicle and an orbital spacecraft consumables resupply system. The requirements for <b>user</b> <b>servicing</b> were derived from the necessity to service attached payloads, free flyers and coorbiting platforms. These requirements include: orbital replacement units (ORU) and instrument changeout, National Space Transportation System cargo bay loading and unloading, contamination control and monitoring, thermal protection, payload berthing, storage, access to SSF distributed systems, functional checkout, and fluid replenishment. The baseline <b>user</b> <b>servicing</b> capabilities accommodate ORU and instrument changeout. However, this service is limited to attached payloads, either in situ or at a locally adjacent site. The growth phase satisfies all identified <b>user</b> <b>servicing</b> requirements by expanding servicing capabilities to include complex servicing tasks for attached payloads, free-flyers and coorbiting platforms at a dedicated, protected Servicing site. To provide a smooth evolution of <b>user</b> <b>servicing</b> the SSF interfaces that are necessary to accommodate the growth phase have been identified. The interface requirements on SSF have been greatly simplified by accommodating the growth servicing support elements within the CSF. This results in a single SSF interface: SSF to the CSF...|$|R
