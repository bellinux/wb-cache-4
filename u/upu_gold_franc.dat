2500|$|Between {{the signing}} of the Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine and April 1922, Bulgaria paid 173 million <b>gold</b> <b>francs</b> in {{reparation}}s. In 1923, the Bulgarian reparation sum was revised downwards to 550 million <b>gold</b> <b>francs,</b> [...] "plus a lump sum payment of 25 million francs for occupation costs". Towards this figure, Bulgaria paid 41 million <b>gold</b> <b>francs</b> between 1925 and 1929. In 1932, the Bulgarian reparation obligation was abandoned following the Lausanne Conference.|$|R
5000|$|This <b>gold</b> <b>franc</b> {{would have}} been defined as 0.1 gram of fine gold. The {{initiative}} would not have removed, replaced or pegged the existing Swiss franc, therefore both the <b>gold</b> <b>franc</b> and the Swiss franc would have coexisted side-by-side. Due to the fixed metallic content of the <b>gold</b> <b>franc,</b> its exchange rate with the Swiss franc would have gone up and down according to market supply and demand, like any other free-floating currency.|$|R

50|$|The <b>gold</b> <b>franc</b> {{would have}} been {{completely}} independent from the gold reserves of the Swiss National Bank.

5000|$|On March 9, 2011, a {{parliamentary}} initiative {{was introduced in}} the National Council of Switzerland to institute a <b>gold</b> <b>franc</b> as additional currency for Switzerland: [...] The Confederation institutes an official <b>gold</b> <b>franc</b> with a set of coins of different denominations, each having a fixed gold content. It regulates the concessions granted to the licensees authorized to mint coins; minting coins is not taxable. [...] This initiative was examined by the Committee for Economic Affairs and Taxation, which rejected it at the June meeting.|$|R

In the French system the <b>gold</b> <b>franc</b> was interchangeable with the silver franc based on an exchange ratio of 1:15.5, which was the approximate relative value of the two metals {{at the time of}} the law of 1803.|$|R

5000|$|The {{captains of}} the crusade {{were asked to}} answer {{allegations}} of receiving bribes totalling 18,000 <b>gold</b> <b>francs.</b> The leaders did not deny the allegations, but argued that {{because they had been}} forced to leave behind valuable horses the money was compensation. The treasurer, Foulmere, and five of the captains (notably, not Calveley) were imprisoned and fined 14,600 <b>gold</b> <b>francs.</b> On 9 January 1384, the Exchequer recorded the receipt of £287 9s. 4d. of money captured during the Flemish expedition, paid by one Henry Bowet on Foulmere's behalf, and the further receipt of £770 16s. 8d. for 5,000 francs [...] "illicitly received" [...] overseas.|$|R
