2500|$|On July 28, 1931, Coll {{allegedly}} {{participated in}} a kidnapping attempt {{that resulted in the}} shooting death of a child. Coll's target was bootlegger Joseph Rao, a Schultz underling who was lounging in front of a social club. Several children were playing outside an apartment house. A large touring car pulled <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>curb,</b> and several men pointed shotguns and submachine guns towards Rao and started shooting. Rao threw himself to the sidewalk, however, and four young children were wounded in the attack. One of them, five-year-old Michael Vengalli, later died at Beth David Hospital. After the Vengalli killing, New York City Mayor Jimmy Walker dubbed Coll a [...] "Mad Dog".|$|E
2500|$|Another writer {{recalled}} {{the area around}} the Dunbar as [...] "a place where people love to congregate and have a good time, check out the new models and pick up on the latest lingo." [...] The Dunbar built a reputation in the 1930s as [...] "the symbol of L.A.'s black nightlife," [...] as [...] "regular jamming sessions and meetings in the hotel lobby elevated the structure to a practically mythical status." [...] Lionel Hampton had fond memories of jam sessions and practices on the Dunbar's mezzanine. Hampton recalled, [...] "Everybody that was anybody showed up at the Dunbar. [...] I remember a chauffeur would drive Stepin Fetchit, the movie star, <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>curb</b> in a big Packard, and he'd look out the window at all the folks." ...|$|E

60|$|Mr. Weatherley {{grunted and}} {{walked out into the}} street. Here his {{behavior}} was a little singular. He walked up toward London Bridge, exchanging greetings with a good many acquaintances on the way. Opposite the London & Westminster Bank {{he paused for a moment}} and looked searchingly around. Satisfied that he was unobserved, he stepped quickly into a very handsome motor car which was drawn <b>up</b> close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>curb,</b> and with a sigh of relief sat as far back among the cushions as possible and held <b>the</b> tube <b>to</b> his mouth.|$|R

60|$|It {{was another}} {{carriage}} that stopped the way now, {{and once more}} the barker made the night ring with what Westover felt his heartless and shameless cries for Miss Lynde's carriage. After a maddening delay, it lagged <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>curb</b> and Jeff pulled the door open.|$|E
30|$|On the contrary, {{we assume}} that, {{in the next}} few years, {{electric}} cars will be mostly small or mid-size cars (see above). An e-conversion project, performed in the laboratory of the authors in 2011, may illustrate weight data exemplarily: A Smart built in the year 2000 has been e-converted from combustion engine to an electric car. A 25 -kW electric engine and a 14 -kWh LiFePO 4 battery were installed, allowing a range of <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 120 km. <b>The</b> <b>curb</b> weight grew by 161 kg to 880 kg, which is little {{more than half of the}} car weight assumed by Helms et al. [40]. A Mitsubishi I-MiEV weighs 1, 110 kg and is equipped with a 16 -kWh Li-ion battery [43]. The Nissan Leaf, however, the first high-volume mid-size electric car, weighs 1, 525 kg and operates a 24 -kWh lithium battery [44].|$|R

His first posting (in 1982) was as Assistant Conservator of Forests (ACF) in Chamarajanagar of Mysore district, which was already the activity of Veerappan, then a small-time poacher.

As ACF he compiled a directory of all sandalwood smugglers and poachers operating {{in the area and}} procured and circulated their photographs. He established and coordinated networks between the police and foresters, drew <b>up</b> strategies <b>to</b> <b>curb</b> <b>the</b> activities of smugglers and poachers and successfully isolated and cornered a large number of them. When the Centre banned sale of ivory and ivory products, along with making possession of ivory articles beyond a limit a cognisable offence, the bandit Veerappan switched to sandalwood smuggling.|$|R

60|$|It was at {{this moment}} that the big box-sled {{containing}} the cadets hove into sight.

60|$|At {{that moment}} a large wagon began to back <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>curb.</b> The seat was {{occupied}} by two men, and Matt at once recognized them as the fellows he had caught hanging around the previous day.
