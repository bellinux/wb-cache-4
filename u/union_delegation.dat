25|$|The destroyer's first mission after {{completing}} sea trials in October 1941 was {{to deliver a}} British trade <b>union</b> <b>delegation</b> from Iceland to Russia. Norman then spent some time as an escort ship, then sailed to Southampton for minor modifications. At the start of 1942, the destroyer {{was assigned to the}} British Eastern Fleet. From January until May, Norman served as a convoy escort in the Indian Ocean, before being recalled to participate in the convoy escort screen for Operation Vigorous, one of two major convoys attempting to supply the island of Malta. After this, she returned to the Indian Ocean, and during September was involved in the Madagascar Campaign. The destroyer spent the remainder of 1942, all of 1943, and the early part of 1944 on uneventful patrols of the Indian Ocean. In late March 1944, Norman sailed to Sydney for a two-month-long refit. This concluded in late June, and Norman returned to the Eastern Fleet.|$|E
500|$|David Lewis ran {{to succeed}} Douglas as {{national}} leader. [...] The 1971 leadership convention was a tumultuous affair. A {{new generation of}} NDP activists known as The Waffle proposed many controversial resolutions, including nationalization of all natural resource industries and support for Quebec Sovereignty. [...] It took the combined efforts of the NDP establishment — and the sizable trade <b>union</b> <b>delegation</b> — to vote down these resolutions, which caused many bitter debates and sharply divided the convention. [...] Lewis, as the leading establishment figure, won the party's leadership on April 24 in a surprisingly close race that required four ballots before he could claim victory over the Waffle's James Laxer. [...] Laxer had been prominently featured in media coverage leading up to and during the convention. [...] Lewis' perceived heavy-handedness in dealing with The Waffle at this and previous conventions made him many enemies, as had his involvement {{in most of the}} CCF and NDP's internal conflicts during the previous 36 years. [...] Many members who had felt his wrath as party disciplinarian plotted their revenge against him. At his first press conference after winning the leadership, Lewis stated that he was not beholden to the Waffle, as they were soundly defeated at the convention, and that he made no promises to them. He also warned the party's Quebec wing that they could continue to theorize about possible self-determination resolutions, but that come election time they must pledge themselves to the party's newly confirmed federalist policy. He did not purge the Waffle from the NDP, but left it to his son Stephen to do in June 1972, when the party's Ontario wing resolved to disband the Waffle or kick its members out of the party if they did not comply with the disbanding order.|$|E

2500|$|With {{relations}} between the Profintern and the IFTU {{at the point of}} insoluble stalemate, Soviet trade union authorities began to concentrate on bilateral [...] relationships with social democratic union movements. Particular attention was placed on the unions of Great Britain, with Russian union chief Mikhail Tomsky traveling to the UK in 1924, followed by a reciprocal visit in November of that year of a high-level delegation headed by A.A. Purcell of the Trades Union Congress. From the Soviet standpoint the British unionists were positively affected by their visit, publishing an extensive and generally favorable report of the Soviet situation upon their return to the UK. This month-long visit of the British trade <b>union</b> <b>delegation</b> would be the prototype for a series of similar visits of the Soviet Union by western union leaders.|$|E

60|$|MY DEAR SIR:--The above act of Congress was passed, as I suppose, for {{the purpose}} of {{shutting}} out improper applicants for seats in the House of Representatives; and I fear there is some danger that it will be used to shut out proper ones.
