40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} the paper is to back-test value-at-risk (VaR) models for {{conditional}} distributions belonging to a Generalized Hyperbolic (GH) family of Lévy processes - Variance Gamma, Normal Inverse Gaussian, Hyperbolic distribution and GH - and compare their risk-management features with a traditional unconditional extreme value (EV) approach using data from future contracts return data of S&amp;P 500, FTSE 100, DAX, HangSeng and Nikkei 225 indices. Design/methodology/approach The authors apply tail-based and Lévy-based calibration to estimate {{the parameters of the}} models as part of the initial data analysis. While the authors utilize the peaks-over-threshold approach for generalized Pareto distribution, the conditional maximum likelihood method is followed in case of Lévy models. As the Lévy models do not have closed form expressions for VaR, the authors follow a bootstrap method to determine the VaR and the confidence intervals. Finally, for back-testing, they use both static calibration (on the entire data) and dynamic calibration (on a four-year rolling window) to test the <b>unconditional,</b> <b>independence</b> and conditional coverage hypotheses implemented with 95 and 99 per cent VaRs. Findings Both EV and Lévy models provide the authors with a conservative proportion of violation for VaR forecasts. A model targeting tail or fitting the entire distribution has little effect on either VaR calculation or a VaR model&# 039;s back-testing performance. Originality/value To the best of the authors&# 039; knowledge, this is the first study to explore the back-testing performance of Lévy-based VaR models.

To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a new locally weighted censored quantile regression approach that adopts the redistribution-of-mass idea and employs a local reweighting scheme. Its validity only requires conditional independence of the survival time and the censoring variable given the covariates, and linearity at the particular quantile level of interest. Our method leads to a simple algorithm that can be conveniently im-plemented with R software.

40|$|Value at Risk (VaR) {{has emerged}} as one of the most {{prominent}} risk measurement techniques in finance. It is a measure that quantifies the worst expected loss over a given confidence level and target horizon, under normal market conditions. In this thesis, the concept of VaR as an invaluable tool for financial risk management is explained, and a theoretical but detailed description of some of the methods of VaR computation are presented, with a key emphasis on the assumptions and shortcomings of these models. A discussion that is preceded by a presentation on the calculation of portfolio returns and the choice of VaR parameters as key determinants in the choice of an appropriate VaR model. In light of the shortcomings to VaR measures, a number of backtesting techniques that examine the accuracy of VaR estimates are presented and reviewed. The review of these VaR validation methods is both from a theory and practice perspective. The <b>unconditional</b> coverage, <b>independence</b> property and the conditional coverage property are defined and their relation to backtesting methods discussed. The backtesting techniques presented are classified by whether they test for the <b>unconditional</b> coverage property, <b>independence</b> property or the conditional coverage (joint) property of a VaR measure. The backtesting methods presented and discussed in this work are then utilized in empirically validating the accuracy of one of the most widely used VaR method in South Africa, the historical simulation. The examination of VaR estimates from this model is applied on an ‘actual’ interest rate portfolio. The outcome of the statistical backtests show positive results of accurate performance of the model at lower confidence levels, and an underestimation of risk at higher VaR confidence levels. However, when hedge positions are excluded from the portfolio the model’s performance in accurately estimating VaR is questionable...|$|R

40|$|Modeling and {{forecasting}} of {{implied volatility}} (IV) {{is important to}} both practitioners and academics, especially in trading, pricing, hedging, and risk management activities, all of which require an accurate volatility. However, it has become challenging since the 1987 stock market crash, as implied volatilities (IVs) recovered from stock index options present two patterns: volatility smirk(skew) and volatility term-structure, if the two are examined at the same time, presents a rich implied volatility surface (IVS). This implies that the assumptions behind the Black-Scholes (1973) model do not hold empirically, as asset prices are mostly influenced by many underlying risk factors. This thesis, consists of four essays, is modeling and forecasting implied volatility {{in the presence of}} options markets’ empirical regularities. The first essay is modeling the dynamics IVS, it extends the Dumas, Fleming and Whaley (DFW) (1998) framework; for instance, using moneyness in the implied forward price and OTM put-call options on the FTSE 100 index, a nonlinear optimization is used to estimate different models and thereby produce rich, smooth IVSs. Here, the constant-volatility model fails to explain the variations in the rich IVS. Next, it is found that three factors can explain about 69 - 88 % {{of the variance in the}} IVS. Of this, on average, 56 % is explained by the level factor, 15 % by the term-structure factor, and the additional 7 % by the jump-fear factor. The second essay proposes a quantile regression model for modeling contemporaneous asymmetric return-volatility relationship, which is the generalization of Hibbert et al. (2008) model. The results show strong negative asymmetric return-volatility relationship at various quantiles of IV distributions, it is monotonically increasing when moving from the median quantile to the uppermost quantile (i. e., 95 %); therefore, OLS underestimates this relationship at upper quantiles. Additionally, the asymmetric relationship is more pronounced with the smirk (skew) adjusted volatility index measure in comparison to the old volatility index measure. Nonetheless, the volatility indices are ranked in terms of asymmetric volatility as follows: VIX, VSTOXX, VDAX, and VXN. The third essay examines the information content of the new-VDAX volatility index to forecast daily Value-at-Risk (VaR) estimates and compares its VaR forecasts with the forecasts of the Filtered Historical Simulation and RiskMetrics. All daily VaR models are then backtested from 1992 - 2009 using <b>unconditional,</b> <b>independence,</b> conditional coverage, and quadratic-score tests. It is found that the VDAX subsumes almost all information required for the volatility of daily VaR forecasts for a portfolio of the DAX 30 index; implied-VaR models outperform all other VaR models. The fourth essay models the risk factors driving the swaption IVs. It is found that three factors can explain 94 - 97 % of the variation in each of the EUR, USD, and GBP swaption IVs. There are significant linkages across factors, and bi-directional causality is at work between the factors implied by EUR and USD swaption IVs. Furthermore, the factors implied by EUR and USD IVs respond to each others’ shocks; however, surprisingly, GBP does not affect them. Second, the string market model calibration results show it can efficiently reproduce (or forecast) the volatility surface for each of the swaptions markets...|$|E

In this paper, we take receivers’ demands as our starting point, use the trade-off model between accuracy and informativeness as the criterion to construct the optimal confidence interval, derive the theoretical formula of the optimal confidence interval and propose a practical and efficient algorithm based on entropy theory and complexity theory. In order to improve the estimation precision of the error distribution, the point prediction errors are STRATIFIED according to prices and {{the complexity of the}} system; the corresponding prediction error samples are obtained by the prices stratification; and the error distributions are estimated by the kernel function method and the stability of the system. In a stable and orderly environment for price forecasting, we obtain point prediction error samples by the weighted local region and RBF (Radial basis function) neural network methods, forecast the intervals of the soybean meal and non-GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) soybean continuous futures closing prices and implement <b>unconditional</b> coverage, <b>independence</b> and conditional coverage tests for the simulation results. The empirical results are compared from various interval evaluation indicators, different levels of noise, several target confidence levels and different point prediction methods. The analysis shows that the optimal interval construction method is better than the equal probability method and the shortest interval method and has good anti-noise ability with the reduction of system entropy; the hierarchical estimation error method can obtain higher accuracy and better interval estimation than the non-hierarchical method in a stable system...|$|R

To date, the most distinguished regression-based backtest, proposed by Engle and Manganelli (2004), relies on a linear model. However, in view of the di- chotomic character of the series of violations, a non-linear model seems more appropriate. In this paper we thus propose a new tool for backtesting (denoted DB) based on a dy- namic binary regression model. Our discrete-choice model, e. g. Probit, Logit, links the sequence of violations to a set of explanatory variables including the lagged VaR and the lagged violations in particular. It allows us to separately test the <b>unconditional</b> coverage, the <b>independence</b> and the conditional coverage hypotheses and it is easy to implement. Monte-Carlo experiments show that the DB test exhibits good small sample properties in realistic sample settings (5 % coverage rate with estimation risk). An application on a portfolio composed of three assets included in the CAC 40 market index is nally proposed. Value-at-Risk; Risk Management; Dynamic Binary Choice Models...|$|R
