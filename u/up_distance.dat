He had his first international success at the 2011 European Athletics Junior Championships, where he was the steeplechase bronze medallist. He also ran in the junior race at the 2011 European Cross Country Championships that year, finishing 53rd.|$|E
50|$|The modern Starting gates {{use only}} a driver for {{steering}} {{the vehicle and}} a starter in the rear to observe the race and call a false start if required. The start speed, acceleration, score <b>up</b> <b>distance,</b> and gate closing are controlled via a computer system, which takes control of the vehicle and provides a printout {{at the end of}} the score up. Some harness racing clubs have been granted additional funds for the installation of the AVA computerised mobile barriers.|$|E

50|$|Locomotive 61 001 {{found itself}} in the British Zone {{at the end of}} the war and was {{allocated}} to Bw Hannover, but seldom used. In 1947 it had a general inspection and on 23 October 1948 it was stationed in Bebra, where it was in regular service until May 1949. After a break, it again clocked <b>up</b> <b>distances</b> of 3000 to 10000 km per month from November 1950. On 2 November 1951 the engine suffered serious damage following an accident in Münster, whereupon it was retired on 14 November 1952 and scrapped in 1957.|$|R

After racing in second place he challenged for the lead two furlongs from the finish {{but was unable to}} quicken and finished third of the ten runners behind Blue Point and Mokarris.|$|E
50|$|The {{motorized}} gate {{drastically reduced}} the number of false starts, but did not eliminate them. If the starter, who rides in the vehicle facing backward toward the horses, sees that the start is not fair in some way, he may issue a recall and order the race to be started again. Today, the start speed, acceleration, score <b>up</b> <b>distance,</b> and gate closing are controlled via a computer system, which takes control of the vehicle and provides a printout {{at the end of the}} score up.|$|E

In 2010-2012 Hawkins competed for the Butler University in the United States, earning all-American status, and winning the 2011 Men's Athlete of the Year award for the Great Lakes Region. He was the first athlete from the Butler University to win the award. After that he studied {{mechanical engineering at the}} University of the West of Scotland. Some time before 2013 he had two surgeries on his left knee.|$|E

40|$|Some {{features}} of the blow up and collapse phenomena characteristic of the focusing nonlinear Schrodinger equation are discussed. Particular attention is given to recently found solutions describing self-similar collapse {{in the form of}} ring-shaped structures. The characteristic parameters of such collapsing rings are found and particular single-humped initial conditions giving rise to ring formation are also discussed. The possibility of self-similarly collapsing beams with parabolic intensity profiles is investigated and used to infer the blow <b>up</b> <b>distance</b> of initially Gaussian beams. The result is shown to be in good agreement with previous empirical results for the blow <b>up</b> <b>distance.</b> (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{transfer}} learning {{has recently been}} of great interest {{in a variety of}} machine learning applications. In this paper, we examine a new angle to the transfer learning problem, where we examine the problem of distance function learning. Specifically, we focus on the problem of how our knowledge of distance functions in one domain can be transferred to a new domain. A good semantic understanding of the feature space is critical in providing the domain specific understanding for setting up good distance functions. Unfortunately, not all domains have feature representations which are equally interpretable. For example, in some domains such as text, the semantics of the feature representation are clear, as a result of which it is easy for a domain expert to set <b>up</b> <b>distance</b> functions for specific kinds of semantics. In the case of image data, the features are semantically harder to interpret, and it is harder to set <b>up</b> <b>distance</b> functions, especially for particular semantic criteria. In this paper, we focus on the problem of transfer learning as a way to close the semantic gap between different domains, and show how to use correspondence information between two domains in order to set <b>up</b> <b>distance</b> functions for the semantically more challenging domain. ...|$|E

30|$|There {{were some}} {{participants}} {{who felt that}} universities would be ill advised to ‘force’ research students into using technology {{even though it is}} increasingly a requirement for professional practice and for those seeking a career as academics. However, as more students take <b>up</b> <b>distance</b> and part-time research opportunities, supervisors will have to meet their needs with more online resources to match the opportunities provided to those on campus. Additional training with emergent technologies could encourage supervisors and their students to keep abreast of the latest innovations. Forums where these new technologies are shared among supervisors would facilitate this transfer of knowledge.|$|E

40|$|Laparoscopic {{hernia repair}} is more {{difficult}} than open hernia repair. The totally extraperitoneal procedure with 3 trocars on the midline is more comfortable for the sur-geon. We studied {{the impact of the}} length between the umbilicus and the pubis on the totally extraperitoneal procedure (95 hernias operated on in 70 patients). This length did not influence the totally extraperitoneal proce-dure in this study. Background: The laparoscopic repair of hernias is consid-ered to be difficult especially for the totally extra-peritoneal technique (TEP) due to a limitedworking space and different appreciation of the usual anatomical landmarks seen through an anterior approach. The aim of our study has been to answer a question: does the umbilical-pubic distance, which influences the size of the mesh, affect the TEP tech-nique used in the treatment of inguinal hernias? Methods: From January 2001 to May 2011, the umbilical-pubic (<b>UP)</b> <b>distance</b> was measured with a sterile ruler grad-uated in centimeters in all patients who underwent a symp-tomatic inguinal hernia by the TEP technique in two hernia surgery centers. The sex, age, BMI, hernia type, <b>UP</b> <b>distance,</b> operation time, hospital stay and complications were pro-spectively examined based on the medical records. Results: Seventy patients underwent 95 inguinal hernia re-pairs by the TEP technique. The umbilical-pubic distance average was 14 cm (10 to 22) and a 25 kg/m 2 (16 – 30) average concerning the body mass index (BMI). Seventy percent of patients were treated on an outpatient basis. The postoperative course was very simple. There was no recur-rence of hernia within this early postoperative period. Conclusion: The umbilical-pubic distance had no influ-ence on the production of TEP with 3 trocars on the midline in this study...|$|E
40|$|This Master Thesis {{examines}} {{the possibility to}} apply a magnetometer developed by the Ångstöm space technology center to a small magnetic ground penetrating radar system with dimension {{in the order of}} one dm³. The magnetometer is broadband (DC- 1 GHz) and miniaturized. Loop antennas are used to transmit the signal.    A series of experiments have been performed in order to characterize the system, mainly examining the ability to determine distance to a target, using continuous sine wave signals and pulse trains. Standing wave patterns are formed between antenna and target and can be used for determining distance in the continuous case. When using a pulse train, the echo from the target could not be resolved using the current experiment set <b>up,</b> <b>distance</b> could therefore not be determined...|$|E
