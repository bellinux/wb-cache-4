50|$|Because of its easy growing {{habits and}} the bright, showy flowers of cultivars such as 'Roulettte' (tiger stripes of gold on a deep {{mahogany}} ground), <b>plains</b> <b>coreopsis</b> is increasingly used for landscape beautification and in flower gardens.|$|R
50|$|<b>Plains</b> <b>coreopsis</b> is {{cultivated}} as an {{ornamental plant}} for gardens, {{and as a}} native plant for wildlife gardens and natural landscaping. It grows well in many types of soil, but seems to prefer sandy or well-drained soils. Although somewhat drought-tolerant, naturally growing plants are usually found in areas with regular rainfall. Preferring full sun, it will also grow in partial shade.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Plains</b> <b>coreopsis,</b> garden tickseed, golden tickseed, or calliopsis, Coreopsis tinctoria, is {{an annual}} forb.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{initiated}} to evaluate wildflower establishment using a preemergence herbicide. Fifty species of wildflowers (Table 1) were established on a Sharpsburg silty-clay loam (Typic Argiudoll), with a 6. 9 pH, near Mead, Neb. Fortyseven (Table 1) wildflowers were established near Hubbard, Ore., on a Willamette sandy loam (Pachic Ultic Argixeroll) with a 6. 6 pH. Both studies used a split-plot design, with herbicide treatment as main plots and wildflowers as subplots. Each treatment {{consisted of two}} replicates. Herbicide treatments included an untreated control and a combination of S-ethyl dipropylthiocarbamate (EPTC) at 2. 3 kg·ha- 1 and α, α, α -trifluoro- 2, 6 -dinitro-N,N-dipropyl-ptoluidine (trifluralin) at 0. 6 kg·ha- 1. Applications were made with a boom-sprayer, and treatments were incorporated with a Lily Roterra (Lely Industries, N. V. Maasland, Holland) cultivator immediately after application. Wildflowers were broadcast-seeded at 2 g pure live seed per plot. Irrigation was applied daily at 4 mm·day- 1 for 6 weeks after seeding and 13 mm·week- 1 thereafter. In the Nebraska study, tall <b>plains</b> <b>coreopsis</b> (Coreopsis tinctoria Nutt.) and cosmos (Cosmos bipinnatus Cav.) plants lodged after heavy rains on 15 (33 mm) and 19 July (60 mm) in the herbicide-treated plots but not the control. The lodged plants continued to grow, but remained lodged throughout the growing season. Herbicide-treated Indian blanket (Gaillardia pulchella Foug.) plants had uneven growth and a 2 -week bloom initiation delay {{when compared to the}} control. After bloom, flowering appeared equal for control and herbicide treatments. About 35 % of all species were adversely affected by the herbicide treatment...|$|R

25|$|The {{first stage}} of Pahawh, Pahawh Pa (Pajhawj Paj), common called the source version, had {{distinct}} glyphs for all 60 onsets and 91 rimes of both Hmong Daw and Hmong Njua. Although there were diacritics, there was no relationship {{between them and the}} sound values of the letters, and many of the diacritics are unique to a single letter. Among the rimes, there was a strong tendency for letters which differed only in diacritic to share the same vowel and differ in tone. However, this was not absolute. For example, a letter shaped like Ü stood for the rime iaj, while U, differing only in its diacritic, stood for the rime <b>us.</b> <b>Plain</b> U without a diacritic did not occur. Similarly, the letter that, without a diacritic, represents the rime ag, when combined with a diacritic dot represents the onset rh. Thus {{it can be seen that}} at this stage the diacritics were integral parts of their letters, with only the beginnings of an independent existence.|$|R
50|$|For example, {{the tornado}} {{frequency}} of Southwestern Ontario {{is about half}} that of the most tornado-prone areas of the central <b>US</b> <b>plains.</b> The last multiple tornado-related deaths in Canada were caused by a tornado in Ear Falls, Ontario on 9 July 2009, where 3 died, and the last killer tornado was on 21 August 2011 in Goderich, Ontario. The two deadliest tornadoes on Canadian soil were the Regina Cyclone of 30 June 1912 (28 fatalities) and the Edmonton Tornado of 31 July 1987 (27 fatalities). Both of these storms were rated an F4 on the Fujita scale. The city of Windsor was struck by strong tornadoes four times within a 61-year span (1946, 1953, 1974, 1997) ranging in strength from an F2 to F4. Windsor has been struck by more significant tornadoes than any other city in Canada. Canada's first official F5 tornado struck Elie, Manitoba on 22 June 2007. Tornadoes are most frequent in the provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario.|$|R
