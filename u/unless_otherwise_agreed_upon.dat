40|$|Prikazuje se {{institut}} obnove (novacije) prema rješenjima Zakona o obveznim odnosima. U prvom dijelu rada je obrađen pojam obnove te su prikazane pretpostavke za novaciju. Nakon toga govori se o sporazumima između suugovaratelja koji se ne smatraju obnovom. U nastavku se obrađuje razgraničenje obnove od sličnih instituta, a zatim pravni učinci valjanog ugovora o obnovi. U završnom poglavlju su sumirani rezultati analize izvršene u radu. According to the Obligations act (Official gazette, Nr. 35 / 05 and 41 / 08), renewal (novation, lat. novatio) is {{a contract}} between the creditor and debtor {{in which the}} existing obligation is terminated and {{is replaced by a}} new one, while the new contract has a different main obligation or different legal basis. Change of a subsidiary obligation is not considered a novation. For the novation it is necessary to cumulatively fulfil the following assumptions: 1. existence of a valid (old) main obligation, 2. will of the parties to exchange the existing obligation for a new one 3. difference between the main obligation or the legal basis, 4. will of the contractor (animus novandi). If the previous obligation was voidable, a legally valid novation is possible, but only if the debtor knew for the reasons of voidance. It is than taken that the debtor, by agreeing to novation, has given up the right to void the contract from which the obligation arises that is being renewed. If the debtor did not know about the voidance of the previous obligation, he is authorised to demand the termination of the contract about novation; after the contract on novation was terminated, it is considered that there was no novation and that the previous obligation did not stop. Novation has certain similarities with settlements and exchange of fulfilment, but still differs from these institutes. With novation, {{there has to be an}} intention and expressed will of the contract parties that by creating the new obligation the old one seizes to exist, while with settlement the previous legal relation is modified so that the first claim or obligation remain in some limited form. When talking about the realtion of novation and exchange of fulfilment, the difference is the following: whit novation the existing obligation is exchanged with a new one so that the old obligation seizes to exist without fulfilment, while with exchange of fulfilment the first obligation does not seize immediately – it seizes after he completes his new obligation. The basic legal impact of the legally valid contract on novation is shown in the fact that the previous obligation seizes to exist, and a new one starts instead. Means of insurance connected to the old obligation seize to exist as well (e. g. deposit, guarantee), as well as all the other subsidiary means – <b>unless</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>upon</b> in the contract. Nach dem Obligationengesetz (Amtsblatt Narodne novine Nr. 35 / 05 und 41 / 08) ist die Novation (novatio) ein Vertrag zwischen einem Gläubiger und einem Schuldner, durch den die bestehende Schuld erlischt und durch eine neue ersetzt wird, wobei sich der neue Vertrag auf eine andere Hauptleistung oder einen anderen Rechtsgrund bezieht. Die Veränderung einer Nebenleistung gilt nicht als Novation. Für die Novation müssen kumulativ folgende Voraussetzungen erfüllt sein: 1. das Bestehen einer gültigen (alten) Hauptschuld, 2. der Wille der Parteien, die bestehende Schuld durch eine neue zu ersetzen, 3. die Unterschiedlichkeit der Hauptleistung oder des Rechtsgrundes sowie 4. der Wille der Vertragsparteien (animus novandi). War die frühere Schuld anfechtbar, so ist eine rechtsgültige Novation möglich, allerdings nur, wenn der Schuldner den Grund der Anfechtbarkeit kannte. Dann wird davon ausgegangen, dass ein Schuldner, der der Novation zustimmt, auf sein Recht, den Vertrag, aus dem die erneuerte Schuld hervorgeht, anzufechten, verzichtet hat. Wusste der Schuldner nicht von der Anfechtbarkeit der früheren Schuld, ist er berechtigt, die Aufhebung des Novationsvertrags zu verlangen. Ist der Novationsvertrag aufgehoben, gilt, dass es keine Novation gab und die frühere Schuld nicht erloschen ist. Die Novation hat gewisse Ähnlichkeiten mit dem Vergleich und dem Erfüllungsersatz, unterscheidet sich aber von diesen Instituten. Bei der Novation muss die Absicht und der bekundete Wille der Vertragsparteien bestehen, dass mit Entstehung einer neuen Schuld die alte erlischt, während beim Vergleich das frühere Rechtsverhältnis modifiziert wird, sodass der ursprüngliche Anspruch beziehungsweise die Schuld in einer geminderten Form weiter bestehen. Zwischen der Novation und dem Erfüllungsersatz wiederum besteht der Unterschied, dass bei der Novation die bisherige Schuld durch eine neue ersetzt wird, sodass die alte Schuld ohne Erfüllung endet, während beim Erfüllungsersatz die ursprüngliche Schuld des Schuldners nicht sofort erlischt, sondern erst, wenn er seine neue Schuld geleistet hat. Die grundlegende Rechtswirkung eines rechtsgültigen Novationsvertrags äußert sich darin, dass die frühere Schuld erlischt und statt ihrer eine neue entsteht. Auch Sicherheiten (z. B. Pfand, Bürgschaft), die an die frühere Schuld geknüpft waren, sowie sonstige Nebenansprüche erlöschen, sofern nichts anderes vereinbart wurde...|$|E
