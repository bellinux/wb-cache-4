Most use Fe-Ni-Cr stainless steel alloy Z 50 nibs which can be interchanged by the <b>user.The</b> feeds are made of ABS plastic and after injection molding are chemically etched with polyethylene glycol (PEG). The etching process causes micro surface scratches by removing styrene from the feed surface and ink channels. This roughening optimizes ink flow characteristics over the feed surface.The 2000 {{fountain pen}} model uses nibs of another type which is incompatible with Lamy's other fountain pen models.|$|E

While B-2 is a good test, it eliminates the effect of fabric when {{in direct contact with}} water. When sweat condenses on the inside of a fabric with a hydrophilic laminate, the lamination will actively pull the water through the fabric reducing condensation. This can be a tremendous addition to the comfort of the <b>user.The</b> B-2 test is also best used for non-waterproof fabrics, so the water in the pan does not pass directly through the uncoated fabric.|$|E

It brought a secure computing environment that anonymized all internet activity, and had portable encrypted file storage. It had been developed and offered by XeroBank and based on a modified Gentoo Linux distribution. It could be executed as a virtual machine through a QEMU hypervisor, VMWare, VirtualBox, and any other major virtualization system. It could also be booted from on USB or burned to CD for booting. Virtualization, along with the native implementation of a Tor onion routing for internet connectivity and other encryption and privacy tools, had been utilized to increase the security and anonymity of the <b>user.The</b> developers claimed that it is the most secure operating system in the worldand that the technology involved is highly resistant to hacking and spying, even in the most hostile environments. The details and transactions inside each xB Machine account were protected with 256-bit AES encryption. The software also had a self-destruct sequence for eliminating any traces that a user may have left behind on the drivespace after using xB Machine. Meanwhile, Xerobank offers a modular package with xB Browser, xB Mail, and xB VPN, parts of it running only for customers of the bank.|$|E

In this {{paper we propose a}} recommendation algorithm, called FasTag, that links the relevance of the tags to both their popularity and the opinions of the user's neighbors. FasTag assumes that the users are organized in a weighted graph representing, for instance, the similarity or the trust between them. The two salient aspects of FasTag are the scoring function it uses to evaluate the relevance of the tags, and its low computation cost. Thus, FasTag can make online recommendations, even for large datasets. Moreover, we improve the accuracy of its recommendations by adjusting automatically the size of the recommended list of tags. The experiments we did on several datasets show a significant improvement of the accuracy of the recommendations...|$|E

40|$|This Master of Science thesis report {{describes}} {{the development process}} which aims to create a concept for a new off-road electric wheelchair for Permobil, {{with a focus on}} the vehicle-to-ground interface. It was performed between January and July 2015 as part of the Master Degree program, Industrial Design Engineering at Luleå University of Technology. Everyone does not have the ability to walk or transport themselves by their own means at trails or rough terrain due to injuries or other kinds of disabilities. The project aims to investigate how a solution should be designed in order to suffice the needs of these kinds of users. In order to achieve the goals, a series of research questions was determined, one of which read: How does the vehicle-to-ground interface affect the traction of the vehicle and the comfort of the <b>user?The</b> theoretical framework presents research findings necessary to reach the aim of this project and focuses on topics such as modularity, terrain types, off-road capability, vehicle dynamics and comfort. The overall development process in this project used a method called Pulse Model. The first stage of the project was market research with a primary focus on Permobil’s X 850 model, which was put through several tests. The main problems found were that its lack of lateral stability, low ground clearance, and overall harsh and bumpy ride comfort. The idea generation included both the use of LEGO® Technic bricks, the catalogue method and function prototypes, which resulted in a multitude of different suspension systems. A concept with front and rear trailing arms were chosen for further development and a full-scale prototype was fabricated and tested, which provided important feedback for the final concept. The prototype enabled a set of key aspects that should be considered when designing an off-road wheelchair. These were a ground clearance of at least 200 mm, four wheel drive, 50 / 50 weight distribution, 360 degree rear wheel steering, a front pivot bar suspension system and active lateral stability system in the rear which makes it able to maintain a level seat while traversing side slopes. In this project it was demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} design an off-road electric wheelchair which enables people with disabilities to move around more freely and independently in tough terrain. It is also possible achieve this on Permobil’s new modular chassis, which will reduce both manufacturing, stock and production costs for the products overall life cycle.

40|$|The problem being {{examined}} is the disturbing noise that is created {{in an open}} plan office on a company working with a creative process, such as a newspaper or a communications agency. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the needs for today for a sound absorber in open offices and create and design a design proposal. The aim is also to develop a marketing material the product proposal. The problem has been broken down into the following questions:- How does the user look at the need of a sound absorber in an open offices solution today?- Does an interior designer apply sound absorbers when they furnish the intended environment? - How can a design that meets the needs that exists be achieved and to speak the <b>user?The</b> study is based on three choice of methods a literature review on selected topics that relate to the topic, an interview with an interior designer to explore how an interior designer applies absorbers in open plan office and finally an extensive survey that treats the user's needs and appropriate appearance for the product proposal. The design process has undertaken the following methods, design brief, requirements specification, functional analysis and sketches to produce the final product proposal. The graphic material is brought out with the help of editing and illustration programs who compiled the final layout. The results of this work show that the problem of noise in open plan offices exists and that there is a need for sound absorbers in the current situation. The requested interior designer always recommends customers to decorate an open plan office using absorbers to create a pleasant working environment. The most suitable design to the user's needs to be achieved and that it will appeal to the user is that the product proposal should have the same colour, be attached to the ceiling, not to block the view between the individuals in the workplace and to fit in the intended environment. Our conclusions after working with the project are that there are needs for sound absorbers that generate in that there is a market for the product. The needs for sound absorbers are becoming larger as it recently has become increasingly common to work in open offices. The colour choice of the product is extremely important since colours express different emotions. It is also very important to find a consistent layout that communicates to the customer in an appropriate way...|$|E
