40|$|In September 2009, U. N. member states, {{including}} the United States, adopted a General Assembly resolution expressing {{strong support for}} the consolidation of four U. N. bodies addressing women's issues into one composite entity. This report discusses possible policy issues that may arise as the composite gender entity is established, including its funding mechanisms, the creation of an effective governance structure, the entity's possible impact on U. N. system in-country operational capacity, and the relationships and coordination between the entity and other U. N. system bodies. The report also discusses the entity in the context of broader U. N. reform efforts and examines the involvement of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Finally, it analyzes U. S. policy toward the new entity, including its possible role in U. S. foreign policy and the level and extent of U. <b>S.</b> <b>financial</b> <b>contributions</b> to existing U. N. system gender entities...|$|R

This article extends the theory by adding several subjective indicators: husband 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>financial</b> strain {{and the couple}} 2 ̆ 7 s appraisal of each other 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>financial</b> and nonfinancial <b>contributions</b> to family. We examined the role of these subjective dimensions of resource in spousal violence {{against the backdrop of}} other predictors, including the husband 2 ̆ 7 s absolute socioeconomic resources, the wife 2 ̆ 7 s economic dependence, and relative resource differences between the husband and wife. The findings not only partly support absolute and relative resource theories but also suggest the salient role of subjective indicators of resources on husband-to-wife physical assault...|$|R

40|$|This paper revisits {{political}} economy {{effects on the}} rate of growth. Taxes are growth enhancing if they finance public services but reduce growth when used for redistribution. Special interests may affect the policymaking by creating a bias in voter perceptions {{as well as by}} <b>financial</b> <b>contributions</b> to politicians. It is shown that a complementary between information provision and <b>financial</b> <b>contributions</b> to politicians is possible. This implies that when <b>financial</b> <b>contributions</b> are present rent-seeking is less probable to be a hindrance to growth.

40|$|Across sub-Saharan Africa, where {{countries}} have scaled up insecticide treated mosquito nets (ITNs), indoor residual spraying (IRS), improved diagnostic tests, and highly effective antimalarial drugs, mortality in children under {{five years of}} age has fallen dramatically. The risk of malaria is declining, and {{it is apparent that}} the cumulative efforts by the President 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s Malaria Initiative (PMI), national governments, The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund), and many other partners are working. According to the World Health Organization 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s (WHO 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s) 2013 World Malaria Report, the malaria mortality rates in children under years of age in Africa were reduced by an estimated 54 percent between 2000 and 2012. Over the same period, the estimated number of malaria cases in all age groups in Africa dropped from 174 million to 165 million, together with a decrease in deaths due to malaria from 802, 000 to 562, 000.

40|$|Through {{the use of}} the {{standard}} tools of poverty analysis, this paper attempts to firstly measure the minimum <b>financial</b> <b>contribution</b> required from the state to eliminate poverty in the society. Secondly, we measure the absolute and relative household poverty impact of instituting a universal income grant, set at different monthly values. Finally, a brief costing exercise of such a grant is undertaken. The minimum <b>financial</b> <b>contribution</b> simulations are very useful insights into the scale and nature of the poverty challenge in South Africa. The universal income grant numbers testify to the importance of balancing the undoubted need for poverty alleviation as against the pressure on the fiscus. Such interventions are likely to induce.
