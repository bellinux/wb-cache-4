40|$|This study {{focuses on}} some {{important}} issues concerning security in mobile health care.

In practise, the demanded security level will guide the chosen methods. That possibly affects the level of difficulty, that is allowed in using the system, too.

40|$|Increasing {{provision}} of public {{information on the}} internet is being driven by eGovernment initiatives worldwide. With this increase, however, there is little consideration of users. <b>Usability</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> a core tenet of public geographic information provision. The central principle of usability design is that “Any system designed for people to use should be easy to learn (and remember), useful, that is, contain functions people really need in their work, and be easy and pleasant to use” (Gould & Lewis 1985, 300). Information provided on the internet, especially, needs to be easy to use and require little user support. This paper explores the extent to which user-centric design is present in the dissemination of public geographic information on Irish planning authority websites. While testing with real users is preferable, it is costly, time consuming (Axup, 2004) and cannot be easily compared across different websites.

QUIM (Quality in Use Integrated Map) framework is proposed by the human-centered software engineering group as an integrative framework for understanding and applying usability models consistently. At its current state of development, the map contains 10 quality in use factors, 27 criteria and more than 100 metrics. It also describes the relationship that exists between these factors, criteria and metrics. The QUIM editor is an application written in Visual Basic, which interacts with a Microsoft Access database. Beside browsing and searching, QUIM editor also helps developers to customize the QUIM Map by extracting factors, criteria, and metric {{that are relevant to}} a specific project or application such as building a customized usability model for measuring trustfulness and satisfaction in Web applications.

DEFINITIONS OF USABILITY The term usability was coined some 10 years ago in order to replace the term “user friendly” which by the early 1980 s had acquired a host of undesirably vague and subjective connotations.

This agrees with Calongne (2001) who postulated in an opinion paper that <b>usability</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> a primary objective in web site design, suggesting that knowing the audience and their objective in using a web site should be considered to achieve usability.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the provision of}} comprehensible and interpretable tools in the wiki web system. This implies that an extensive research has been made upon the system, i. e., a hypertext system at the Spatial Information Architecture Laboratory (SIAL) at RMIT University in Australia. The process to develop these tools is based on certain requirements due to the user. The wiki web system {{is becoming more and}} more common in communities, projects, education etc. Companies provide wiki systems to share project information as an online collaborative tool. Another way of using a wiki is as an encyclopaedia. This is currently done in Wikipedia which has been an online wiki encyclopaedia since 2001. This solution is an exceptional way to extract and share information quickly. The problem in a wiki is to get an interpretable overview of the whole system, as well as to organise the pages and the structure of the pages in a fine way. The problem is that the number of wiki pages, which are represented as hyperlinks in the system, quickly grown. Therefore, the user needs to be able to navigate within the system and this will require a map. The proposed solution is to provide such a map, namely, a global view of the system. Likewise, the user needs to be able to organize the information, and this will require special tools. The proposed solution is to provide such tools, namely, split and merge tools. In order to develop these tools, direct manipulation and <b>usability</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> taken into consideratio...|$|E
40|$|Web {{geographic}} information systems (GISs) and the Internet are now providing the connectivity {{necessary to support}} large-scale data access by {{a wide variety of}} users, including not just scientific researchers, but also policy-makers and marine resource managers. However, connectivity alone cannot ensure that those who need natural resource information will be able to locate relevant data. Data clearinghouses need to provide user interfaces that help a broad user community understand what spatial data are available, how they can be obtained, and how they should be interpreted. The Metadata Humane Society project conducted by researchers at Oregon State University combined traditional interface engineering knowledge, scientific research and {{geographic information}} science (www. nacse. org/mhs). The researchers wanted to improve access to spatial information by identifying the primary barriers to usability for the National Geospatial Data Clearinghouse (NGDC) interfaces. The project included developing an understanding of the current state of usability among GIS-related Web sites that provide metadata search facilities and identifying promising approaches to “learnability” and navigability that might be exploited in improving the NGDC interfaces. To accomplish these 3 goals, three types of usability evaluations were performed: initial predictive evaluation of existing sites, user testing of existing NGDC Interface, and a user expectations survey. The evaluations involved actual users from a range of disciplinary backgrounds and user communities, as well different levels of expertise. The project found that different levels of user expertise require distinct subsets of the usability criteria. It is recommended that there be at least two interfaces available for the NGDC addressing different target audiences, and that each interface should focus on certain criteria. To improve the delivery of spatial information to marine resource managers, these recommendations to increase <b>usability</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> applied to data clearinghouses such as the Virtual Oregon, Oregon Coast Geospatial Clearinghouse and the Geography Network...|$|E
40|$|Several European countries, {{including}} the UK, {{are investing in}} large-scale telehealthcare pilots, to thoroughly evaluate the benefits of telehealthcare. Due to {{the high level of}} risk associated with such projects, it becomes desirable to be able to predict the success of telehealthcare systems in potential deployments, in order to inform investment and help save resources. An important factor for the success of any telehealthcare deployment is usability, as it helps to achieve the benefits of the technology through increased productivity, decreased error rates, and better acceptance. In particular, efficiency, one of the characteristics of <b>usability,</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> seen as a central measure for success, as the timely care of a high number of patients is one of the important claims of telehealthcare. Despite the recognized importance of usability, it is seen as secondary in the design of telehealthcare systems. The resulting problems are difficult to predict due to the heterogeneity of deployment contexts. This thesis proposes the automation of usability evaluation through the use of modelling and simulation techniques. It describes a generic methodology which can guide a modeller in reusing models for predicting characteristics of usability within different deployment sites. It also describes a modelling approach which can be used together with the methodology, to run in parallel a user model, inspired from a cognitive architecture, and a system model, represented as a basic labelled transition system. The approach simulates a user working with a telehealthcare system, and within her environment, to predict the efficiency of the system and work process surrounding it. The modeller can experiment with different inputs to the models in terms of user profile, workload, ways of working, and system design, to model different potential- real or hypothetical- deployments, and obtain efficiency predictions for each. A comparison of the predictions helps analyse the effects on efficiency of changes in deployments. The work is presented as an experimental investigation, but emphasises the great potential of modelling and simulation for helping to inform investment, help reduce costs, mitigate risks and suggest changes that would be necessary for improving the usability, and therefore success or telehealthcare deployments. My vision is that, if used commercially, the approaches presented in this thesis could help reduce risks for scaling up telehealthcare deployments...|$|E
