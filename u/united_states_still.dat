5|$|With {{support from}} California (because {{the state had}} profited from the import of sugar), Kalākaua again {{approached}} Congress. When the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>still</b> seemed uninterested in reciprocity, he threatened to forge more favorable export agreements with Australia or New Zealand. Congress feared that a treaty between Hawaii and Australia or New Zealand would result in annexation by one of those countries instead of the United States. Although Kalākaua was loath to give any foreign country land in Hawaii, he signed the treaty in September 1887.|$|E
5|$|The 1984 Summer Olympics, officially {{known as}} the Games of the XXIII Olympiad, were an {{international}} multi-sport event held in Los Angeles, California, United States, from 28 July to 12 August 1984. These Games had 6,829 athletes from 140 NOCs participating {{in a total of}} 221 events in 23 sports. Athletes from 47 NOCs won medals, of which 25 secured at least a gold medal. As a result, 93 NOCs were left without any medal. The host NOC, the United States, received 83 gold medals, breaking the previous Summer Olympic record of 78 golds, set at the 1904 Summer Olympics. Even so, the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>still</b> won fewer medals than the previous overall record.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} the closure has been questioned, as the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>still</b> {{has the ability to}} conduct drone attacks from nearby bases in Afghanistan, and {{according}} to the Pakistani military, the base was used mainly for refuelling and maintenance of drones, as well as for emergency landings and logistical support, and not for conducting actual drone operations which had in fact ceased in April 2011. Following the incident, Pakistan stated its intention to shoot down any future US drones intruding on its airspace, and the US suspended drone operations to avoid antagonising Pakistan. One report said that American drone attacks in Pakistan dropped by as much as 50% due to the Salala attack, as well as legal cases.|$|E

5|$|With Mr. Wrestling II and Magnum T.A. {{splitting}} up, the Midnight Express {{needed a}} new team to defend their newly won title against. They began {{a long series of}} matches against The Rock 'n' Roll Express (Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson) which ran well into the 1990s and spanned several wrestling promotions. The two teams feuded throughout 1984 in Mid-South Wrestling before the Midnight Express left the promotion. The Midnight Express versus Rock 'n' Roll Express series of matches were so well received by the fans that independent promoters all over the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>still</b> book those two teams against each other today, 20 years after the rivalry started.|$|E
5|$|As decolonisation {{proceeded}} {{throughout the}} British Empire in the 1950s and 1960s, former colonies often did not reject English but rather {{continued to use}} it as independent countries setting their own language policies. For example, the view of the English language among many Indians has gone from associating it with colonialism to associating it with economic progress, and English continues to be an official language of India. English is also widely used in media and literature, and the number of English language books published annually in India is the third largest in the world after the US and UK. However English is rarely spoken as a first language, numbering only around a couple hundred-thousand people, and less than 5% of the population speak fluent English in India. David Crystal claimed in 2004 that, combining native and non-native speakers, India now has more people who speak or understand English than {{any other country in the}} world, but the number of English speakers in India is very uncertain, with most scholars concluding that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>still</b> has more speakers of English than India.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the restricted stock studies, U.S. publicly traded companies are able to sell stock to offshore investors (SEC Regulation S, enacted in 1990) without registering the shares with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Typically, these shares are sold for 20% to 30% below the publicly traded share price. Some of these transactions have been reported with discounts of more than 30%, resulting {{from the lack of}} marketability. These discounts are similar to the marketability discounts inferred from the restricted and pre-IPO studies, despite the holding period being just 40 days.|$|E
25|$|Stephan's death causes Bagradian to {{withdraw}} for a time, during which Turkish soldiers capture {{the last of}} the Armenian livestock. This disaster opens rifts in Musa Dagh's society and resolve. Other setbacks follow; with the arrival of a seasoned Ottoman general from the Gallipoli front, as well as reinforcements from the regular army. The Ottomans begin to tighten the noose around Musa Dagh. Bagradian recovers from his grief, to form guerrilla bands to disrupt the Ottoman advance and buy more time. No ships have been sighted and attempts to contact the Allies or to seek the diplomatic intercession of the <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> <b>still</b> a neutral power, or Turkey’s ally, Imperial Germany, come to naught.|$|E
25|$|Measures {{of general}} {{intelligence}} also remain controversial. Early IQ tests were notorious for producing higher IQ scores for privileged races and classes and lower scores for disadvantaged subgroups. Although IQ tests have changed substantially {{over the past}} half century, and many objections to the early tests have been addressed by 'culture neutral' tests (such as the Raven test), IQ testing remains controversial. Regardless of the tests used to identify children for gifted programs, many {{school districts in the}} <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>still</b> have disproportionately more White and Asian American students enrolled in their gifted programs, while Hispanic and African American students are usually underrepresented. However, research shows that this may be not be a fault of tests, but rather a result of the achievement gap in the United States.|$|E
