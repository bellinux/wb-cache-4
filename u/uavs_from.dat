The wreckages of downed UAVs were shown on Serbian television during the war. Some American sources claim a second F-117A was also heavily damaged, and although it made it back to its base, it never flew again. A-10 Thunderbolts have been reported as losses, with two shot down and another two damaged. Three American soldiers riding a Humvee in a routine patrol were captured by Yugoslav Special Forces across the Macedonian border.|$|E

50|$|Initially, the French Air Force {{deployed}} two Mirage F1 CR Reconnaissance {{from the}} 2/33 Savoie Reconnaissance Squadron and six Mirage 2000D fighter jets, which were already {{part of the}} French military Opération Épervier in Chad. Additionally, the Air Force deployed three KC-135 Stratotanker planes, {{as well as one}} C-130 Hercules and one Transall C-160 transport planes from the French airbase in N'Djamena. On 13 January, four Rafale fighter jets of the 1/7 Provence Fighter Squadron flew from the Saint-Dizier Airbase in France to attack targets in the city of Gao. The Rafale planes then proceeded to N'Djamena and would remain based there {{for the duration of the}} conflict. By January 16th, the French Air Force dispatched two additional KC-135 Stratotanker planes and two Harfang <b>UAVs</b> <b>from</b> the 1/33 Belfort Reconnaissance Squadron to N'Djamena. To transport Army troops to Bamako, the Air Force used the Airbus A310 and A340 of the 3/60 Estérel Transport Squadron. On January 23rd, a detachment of Fusiliers Commandos de l'Air was deployed to the airport in Bamako to provide security for the French Air Force assets stationed there and to execute combat search and rescue missions if necessary. Along with the Fusiliers, the Air Force deployed two Puma helicopters of the 1/67 Pyrénées Helicopter Squadron in the combat search and rescue role to Bamako. On January 25th, the Air Force deployed two additional Rafale fighter jets and two additional KC-135 Stratotanker planes to N'Djamena, bringing the total to six Rafale jets and 5 KC-135's in the theater of operations. Transall C-160 transport planes from the 1/64 Béarn and 2/64 Anjou squadrons and C-130H Hercules transport planes from the 2/61 Franche Comté squadrons were used to ferry materiel to Bamako, while Transall C-160 transport planes from the 3/61 Poitou Transport Squadron flew reinforcements to the airport of Gao.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe role of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) for modern military operations {{is expected to}} expand in the 21 st Century, including increased deployment of <b>UAVs</b> <b>from</b> Navy ships at sea. Autonomous operation of <b>UAVs</b> <b>from</b> ships at sea requires the UAV to land on a moving ship using only passive sensors installed in the UAV. This thesis investigates the feasibility of using passive vision sensors installed in the UAV to estimate the UAV position relative to the moving platform. A navigation algorithm based on photogrammetry and perspective estimation is presented for numerically determining the relative position and orientation of an aircraft {{with respect to a}} ship that possesses three visibly significant points with known separation distances. Original image processing algorithms that reliably locate visually significant features in monochrome images are developed. Monochrome video imagery collected during flight test with an infrared video camera mounted in the nose of a UAV during actual landing approaches is presented. The navigation and image processing algorithms are combined to reduce the flight test images into vehicle position estimates. These position estimates are compared to truth data to demonstrate the feasibility of passive, vision-based sensors for aircraft navigation. Conclusions are drawn, and recommendations for further study are presented[URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|E
