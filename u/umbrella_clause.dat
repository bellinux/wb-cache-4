The aim of the thesis is to identify and assess individual interpretation issues that are faced by the arbitration tribunals when applying this provision. The thesis is composed from two main parts, theoretical one and analytical one. Each part is further divided into two separate chapters. First chapter familiarizes a reader with the basic instruments of international investment law, the bilateral investment treaties and investment contracts. The <b>umbrella</b> <b>clause</b> issue is closely intertwined with the topic of internationalization of investment contract, which is also discussed within this chapter. The second chapter provides basic introduction to the examined legal institution. Besides determining characteristic features of the <b>umbrella</b> <b>clause</b> and basic variations of its wording, the chapter also focuses on presence of this provision in contemporary sources of international investment law. In this regard, detailed analysis of the Czech bilateral investment treaties is presented. Last but not least, the attention is paid to the historical context of the issue. The detailed analysis of the International [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{discusses}} {{what is the}} scope of Umbrella Clauses. State undertakings must satisfy the condition of being investment. That is the first requirement of applicability of investment regime to state undertakings. Despite state undertakings was seen as wide concept (by some tribunals) {{the language of the}} clause and prevailing view support undertakings must be limited to contractual undertakings (in practice some viewed that <b>Umbrella</b> <b>Clause</b> can be extended to municipal law obligations)). However, for the purpose of attribution of contracts under international law, states must be involved. But international obligation only arises when state abuses its contractual undertaking. When contracts are concluded by private parties, the investor must demonstrate that that private party was exercising the element of governmental function when it entered into on behalf of particular state. And also, breach must arise from the exercising of granted public function. This will narrow the types of contractual undertakings to licenses, concessions or stabilization clauses. This means, even though certain commercial contracts can qualify to be an investment does not necessarily elevate these kind of contracts under international law. Because of absence of any exercising of governmental function while entering into such contracts. Those contracts nature just commercial and investor will provide some service for certain amount of pay...|$|E
40|$|A {{large number}} of BITs {{concluded}} by France contain quite a peculiar clause (for instance Article 10 BIT with Argentina), which has been recently the object of questionable interpretations and applications in EDF International S. A. et al. v. Argentina and Mr. Franck Charles Arif v. Moldova. Both tribunals allowed the claimants to benefit, through the MNF <b>clause,</b> from <b>umbrella</b> <b>clauses</b> contained in BITs with third States. It is argued that neither tribunal has rigorously interpreted the relevant provisions in the basic treaty, nor ensured compliance with the ejusdem generis principle. The legal uncertainty that surrounds these provisions is detrimental for foreign investors and States alike. Concerned States should consider taking the measures necessary to clarify, jointly or individually, the content of these provisions and of the obligations stemming from them...|$|R

40|$|The {{principal}} {{objective of this}} thesis {{is to examine the}} scope of investment treaty protection against the host state’s interference with foreign investment, and to identify the frontiers of state responsibility under international investment agreements in light of the decline of expropriation and the rise of non-expropriatory standards of treatment, including the standard of national treatment, fair and equitable treatment and <b>umbrella</b> <b>clauses.</b> In making a foray into the stormy relationship between the protection of foreign investment and the host state’s freedom to intervene in the marketplace in the exercise of its regulatory functions, this study is embedded in the wider context of the ongoing debate about the design of the mechanism of investment protection as well as its function in practice. It is argued that the expropriation standard does not provide an adequate framework for determining investor claims against host states. The thesis puts forward a proposal to abandon expropriation and to adopt a unified standard of treatment based on the guarantees of non-discrimination, non-arbitrariness and due process of law.

40|$|Enforcing {{intellectual}} property (IP) rights abroad is not easy—not least because international IP treaties do not create global rights {{that can be}} invoked in national courts. International investment law offers potential routes for overcoming these hurdles. Whenever investment treaties include IP rights as an investment and allow for investor–state dispute settlement (ISDS), investors can challenge host state measures affecting their IP rights in ISDS proceedings. As this article will show, this in turn offers a unique opportunity for invoking the standards of protection under international investment agreements (IIAs) to challenge host state compliance with international IP treaties. While challenging national IP regimes is an attractive option for right holders, these challenges potentially amount to a sea change for the international IP regime and cause serious concern for host states. I, however, argue {{that most of the}} routes pursued by right holders under IIAs are unlikely to be successful. Investment protection standards such as fair and equitable treatment, <b>umbrella</b> <b>clauses,</b> and most-favoured nation treatment should not be construed to allow invoking alleged breaches of international IP norms in ISDS. Some IIAs, however, contain clauses that subject expropriation claims against compulsory licenses and other IP limitations to a test of consistency with the international IP rules governing these limitations. As they offer the only feasible route for investors to challenge host state compliance with international IP treaties, I review the implications of these clauses, recent reform proposals, and suggest alternative mechanisms for aligning international IP and investment protection based on general international law...|$|R

40|$|The World Trade Organization (“WTO”) and {{bilateral}} investment treaties (“BITs”) {{are among the}} most significant legal developments in the history of international economic law. Never before in the history of international relations has trade and investment been supported by such powerful legal guarantees and adjudicative processes. In less than two decades the WTO and BITs have permanently altered the legal landscape with reciprocal and mutually advantageous arrangements designed to reduce barriers to trade and investment and eliminate discriminatory treatment in international economic relations. In most respects the worlds of trade and investment are on parallel tracks headed in the same direction. The ends are similar, but the means toward those ends are distinct. The purpose of this essay is to highlight discrete areas where a convergence of the two disciplines is emerging. These points of convergence are limited, but significant. The first point of convergence highlights the mutually reinforcing nature of trade and investment. The guarantees in BITs and the WTO are baseline protections that reflect international minimum standards that nations accord to every other trading partner. Preferential trade agreements with investment chapters promote deep vertical integration and efficient global production lines by minimizing trade costs, maximizing market access, and harmonizing cross-border regulatory standards. The convergence of trade and investment in deep preferential trade agreements {{is a reflection of the}} modern era of globalized chains of supply. The second point of convergence emphasizes the unifying commitment in both trade and investment regimes against discrimination and protectionism. While the WTO focuses on non-discrimination with respect to like products and services, BITs focus on non-discrimination with respect to the regulation of similarly-situated foreign and domestic investors. Despite the textual differences, in no other area of law has WTO jurisprudence influenced the resolution of investment claims more than with respect to BIT national treatment guarantees. The third point of convergence is the trend toward parallel WTO and BIT proceedings, which is only possible through the convergence of substantive norms. Thus far we have seen such parallel proceedings in less than a handful of cases, but the proliferation of BITs and investment arbitration will increase such opportunities. There is an obvious symmetry between the two types of proceedings, with one looking forward and the other looking backward. The fourth point of convergence is the use of trade remedies to enforce investment arbitration awards. Investment arbitration was designed in a manner such that recognition and enforcement of adverse investment awards was presumed. That is not how things have played out, and the Argentina kerfuffle suggests that foreign investors increasingly may pursue trade remedies to secure enforcement of investment arbitration awards. The final point of convergence is relying on investment arbitration to enforce international trade rights. Despite the assumption that international trade disputes must be resolved before the WTO Dispute Settlement Body, the existence of broad <b>umbrella</b> <b>clauses</b> in BITs presents an emerging vehicle for enforcing investment commitments in trade agreements...|$|R
