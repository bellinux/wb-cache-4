60|$|At length {{we reached}} their lines, {{passing through a}} storm of arrows, and there began such a battle as I {{had never heard of}} or even dreamed. With axes, stone-headed clubs and spears, both armies fought furiously, and though the Incas still outnumbered us by two to one, because of my {{training}} our regiments drove them back. Lord after lord rushed at me with glaring eyes, but my mail turned their copper spears and knives of flint. Oh! Wave-Flame fed full that day, and if Thorgrimmer my forefather could have seen <b>us</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>home</b> <b>in</b> Valhalla, surely he must have sworn by Odin that never had he given it such a feast.|$|E

5|$|At 42, Glenn was {{the oldest}} member of the {{astronaut}} corps and would likely be close to 50 {{by the time the}} lunar landings took place. During Glenn's training, NASA psychologists determined that he was the astronaut best suited for public life. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy suggested to Glenn and his wife in December 1962 that he run for the <b>U.S.</b> Senate <b>from</b> Ohio in 1964, challenging aging incumbent Stephen M. Young (1889–1984) in the Democratic primary election. Since it seemed unlikely that he would be selected for Project Apollo missions, he resigned from NASA on January 16, 1964, and announced his Democratic Party candidacy for the <b>U.S.</b> Senate <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>home</b> state of Ohio the following day.|$|R

5000|$|In 1980, Denton ran as a Republican for a <b>U.S.</b> Senate seat <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>home</b> {{state of}} Alabama. In the primary election, he easily {{defeated}} former U.S. Congressman Armistead Selden, {{who was the}} candidate of choice of the Republican establishment in the state. He then achieved a surprise victory with 50.15 {{percent of the vote}} in November over Democrat Jim E. Folsom, Jr., who himself had defeated the incumbent, Donald W. Stewart, in the Democratic primary. In doing so, Denton became the first and only retired Navy admiral elected to the United States Senate. He was the first Republican to be popularly elected in Alabama since the direct election of U.S. Senators began in 1914, the first Republican senator since Reconstruction to represent Alabama in the U.S. Senate, and the first Catholic to be elected to statewide office in Alabama. Compiling a conservative voting record in the U.S. Senate, Denton was featured in a 1981 article in Time Magazine called [...] "An Admiral from Alabama".|$|R
2500|$|In March 1956, Stevens's friend Elmer Bennett, {{legislative}} {{counsel in}} the Department of the Interior, was promoted by Secretary of the Interior Douglas McKay to the Secretary's office. Bennett successfully lobbied McKay {{to replace him}} in his old job with Stevens, and Stevens returned to Washington, D.C., {{to take up the}} position. By the time he arrived in June 1956, McKay had resigned in order to run for the <b>U.S.</b> Senate <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>home</b> state of Oregon and Fred Andrew Seaton had been appointed to replace him. Seaton, a newspaper publisher from Nebraska, was a close friend of Fairbanks Daily News-Miner publisher C.W. Snedden, and in common with Snedden was an advocate of Alaska statehood, unlike McKay, who had been lukewarm in his support. Seaton asked Snedden if he knew any Alaskan who could come to Washington, D.C. to work for Alaska statehood; Snedden replied that the man he needed—Stevens—was already there working in the Department of the Interior. The fight for Alaska statehood became Stevens's principal work at Interior. [...] "He did all the work on statehood," [...] Roger Ernst, Seaton's assistant secretary for public land management, later said of Stevens. [...] "He wrote 90 percent of all the speeches. Statehood was his main project." [...] A sign on Stevens's door proclaimed his office as [...] "Alaskan Headquarters", and Stevens became known at the Department of the Interior as [...] "Mr. Alaska." ...|$|R
