40|$|Incremental utility {{elicitation}} (IUE) is a decisiontheoretic {{framework in}} which tools simultaneously make suggestions to a human decision maker based on an incomplete model of the decision maker’s utility function, and update the model based on feedback from the user.

We describe a system called VEIL that is based on visual exploration of the available alternatives and provides visual cues about their estimated utility based on IUE. VEIL uses a linear programming formulation to make fast updates to the utility estimate based on the user’s expressed preferences between pairs of alternatives. In experiments, VEIL’s update method converges quickly to make good suggestions and help the <b>user</b> <b>form</b> an overall impression of the space of alternatives...|$|E

40|$|Understanding how <b>users</b> <b>form</b> {{perceptions}} of a software innovation would help software designers, implementers and users in their evaluation, selection, implementation and on-going use of software. However, {{with the exception of}} some recent work, there is little research examining how a <b>user</b> <b>forms</b> his or her {{perceptions of}} an innovation over time. To address this research need, we report on the experiences of a health planner using a DSS software tool for health planning over a 12 -month period. Using diffusion theory as outlined by Rogers, we interpret the user's perceptions of the software following Rogers' perceived characteristics of the innovation. Furthermore, we show how our user justifies her attitudes toward the technology using 5 important factors during 3 -, 6 - and 12 -month interviews: stage of adoption, implementation processes, organizational factors, subjective norms, and user competence. Results are compared with key IS research in these areas, and the implications of these findings on the diffusion of decision support systems are discussed...|$|R
