The joint {{business}} prospered, becoming Newcastle's leading engraving service with an enviable reputation for high quality work and good service. In September 1776 he went to London for eight months, finding the city rude, deceitful and cruel, and much disliking the <b>unfairness</b> <b>of</b> extreme wealth and poverty side by side. He returned to his beloved Newcastle {{as soon as he}} could, but his time in the capital gave him a wider reputation, business experience, and an awareness of new movements in art.|$|E
25|$|People {{who have}} ventromedial frontal cortex lesions {{were found to}} be more likely to reject unfair offers. This was {{suggested}} to be due to the abstractness and delay of the reward, rather than an increased emotional response to the <b>unfairness</b> <b>of</b> the offer.|$|E

25|$|The local Church {{officials}} on Corfu (as {{well as on}} the other Ionian Islands) maintained a deliberate neutrality during the anti-semitic events and did not support the government's efforts to reestablish order, unlike the high echelons of the Church, who took measures to limit the anti-Semitic mood.

25|$|Warner also {{arranged}} for DNA tests of evidence {{left from the}} case of Roger Keith Coleman, who was put to death by the state in 1992. Coleman was convicted in the 1981 rape and stabbing death of his 19-year-old sister-in-law, Wanda McCoy. Coleman drew national attention, even making the cover of Time, by repeatedly claiming innocence and protesting the <b>unfairness</b> <b>of</b> the death penalty. DNA results announced on January 12, 2006 confirmed Coleman's guilt.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{solution}} {{to cope with}} the <b>unfairness</b> limitations <b>of</b> the Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) algorithm. Indeed, in current widely deployed IEEE 802. 11 b wireless local area networks (WLAN), the performance of all the competing access nodes are dramatically affected once the bit rate of one station degrades. This anomaly is due to the <b>unfairness</b> behavior <b>of</b> the DCF algorithm. To avoid this, our solution is based on multiple backoff windows principle. We demonstrate through simulations the efficiency of our proposal. Our results show that the proposed algorithm enables fair bandwidth sharing and increases significantly the total network throughput. 1...|$|R

25|$|The {{second reason}} {{has to do}} with precedent. In the 1920s, the Supreme Court upheld the {{constitutionality}} and validity of several land laws. Invalidating the California Alien Land Law would have required overturning these decisions – something that the Court is typically loath to do, especially so shortly after the decision dates. In this case, the Court was able to address the <b>unfairness</b> <b>of</b> the application of the law by focusing on the petitioners’ first contention, and effectively ignore the broader implications.|$|E

While his client Huang Hsin-chieh, the leading opposition dissident, and seven co-defendants, including his future Vice President Annette Lu, were found guilty, Chen {{came to be known}} for his forceful and colorful arguments.

The Commission instead implemented an 18-1 ratio. Michael Mukasey, in the Attorney General's capacity, vehemently opposed and testified against this change, warning that thousands of violent criminals may be released under the guidelines and endanger the community. Mukasey's move was criticized by advocates of elimination of crack-powder disparity.|$|E

25|$|In 1884, a {{sub-committee}} of the regatta’s Committee of Management discussed {{options for}} reducing the <b>unfairness</b> <b>of</b> the course. Their recommendation was to move the finish line downstream to Poplar Point (thus avoiding the bend) and the start {{to the bottom of}} Temple Island. This was not popular with spectators as it made previous viewing points obsolete. The sub-committee also recommending reducing the racing lanes from three to two and extending racing from two days to three. The Committee gained support from the Captains of competing Clubs and the changes were introduced for the 1886 Regatta.|$|E
25|$|The New Course started just {{downstream}} of Temple Island, on the Buckinghamshire {{side and}} finished opposite the upstream end of Phyllis Court, {{very close to}} the current finish line. There were two slight bends (at Remenham and just after Fawley) and a staggered start to compensate for them. The course was also piled for the first time, although not boomed. Unfortunately, it became apparent that in trying to eliminate the <b>unfairness</b> <b>of</b> the Old Course, a new problem had been introduced. Downstream of Fawley, bushes grew alongside the Buckinghamshire bank and provided shelter from the prevailing wind. The course now ran close to this bank and crew on the Buckinghamshire station gained the advantage of shelter whenever a ‘Bushes Wind’ was blowing. From 1886 to 1905, Bucks took 59% of wins against 41% on Berks.|$|E
25|$|Tara held great {{significance}} to the Irish population {{as it was the}} historic seat of the High Kings of Ireland. Clontarf was symbolic because of its association with the Battle of Clontarf in 1014, when the Irish King Brian Boru defeated his rival Maelmordha, although Brian himself died during the battle. Despite appeals from his supporters, O'Connell refused to defy the authorities and he called off the meeting, as he was unwilling to risk bloodshed and had no others. He was arrested, charged with conspiracy and sentenced to a year's imprisonment and a fine of £2,000, although he was released after three months by the House of Lords, which quashed the conviction and severely criticised the <b>unfairness</b> <b>of</b> the trial. Having deprived himself of his most potent weapon, the monster meeting, O'Connell with his health failing had no plan and dissension broke out in the Repeal Association.|$|E

Indeed, to prevent any accusations <b>of</b> <b>unfairness,</b> the Board <b>of</b> Trade Examiners habitually failed all candidates who sat the examinations with her.|$|R

25|$|After the war Johnston {{struggled}} {{to make a living}} for himself and his wife, who was ailing. He became president of a small railroad, the Alabama and Tennessee River Rail Road Company, which during his tenure of May 1866 to November 1867, was renamed the Selma, Rome and Dalton Railroad. Johnston was bored with the position and the company failed for lack of capital. He established in 1868 an insurance company in Savannah, Georgia, acting as an agent for the Liverpool and London and Globe Insurance Company, and within four years had a network of more than 120 agents across the deep South. The income from this venture allowed him to devote time to his great postwar activity, writing his memoirs. His Narrative of Military Operations, published in 1874, was highly critical of Davis and many of his fellow generals, continuing his grievance about the <b>unfairness</b> <b>of</b> his ranking as a general and attempting to justify his career as a cautious campaigner. The book sold poorly and its publisher failed to make a profit.|$|E
25|$|In early 1945 Powers was {{directed}} to a race relations meeting in Chicago with the new American Council on Race Relations and began an endeavor of learning himself and then promulgating race relations issues across police departments. The first major project started in Richmond, California with Davis McEntire. Initial efforts were aimed at training the police in human relations including trying to eliminate prejudice and present the <b>unfairness</b> <b>of</b> segregation and discrimination based on race - factors later observed to be widespread needs. The work brought together leaders of the California Department of Corrections, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Japanese American Citizens League, and a Nisei, second-generation American of Japanese descent, US Marine. Together the social norms and prejudices of the day were vented, discussed, and broken down across a week of open-ended discussions. Following the training incendiary incidents arose {{in the community and}} the police took novel actions ensuring fairness and peace was retained. The Saturday Evening Post covered it in Cops don't have to be brutal, Dec 28, 1946. Following this numerous police departments even outside California were informed of the training and a booklet A Guide to Race Relations for Peace Officers was created and distributed, (including excerpts in the Baltimore Afro-American newspaper.) There was a prospective project by the young American Council on Race Relations using it and on making a training film with Powers writing the script, working with Edwin Embree. Out of this Powers was on a short list of leaders in the field though more recent scholarship critiqued the program for not including the local minority leadership of the time.|$|E
25|$|As the {{complaints}} from the BMX upper crust-the Pros and BMX Press-increased, the more Mennenga resented {{and took a}} defensive position. This defensiveness that perhaps slowly calcified to an unwillingness to listen help to create an unorganized Pro rider boycott in 1983 and into part of 1984. It was led unofficially by Greg Hill, {{one of the most}} respected and winningest professionals at the time, and included legendary racers like Stu Thomsen over the alleged <b>unfairness</b> <b>of</b> its pro points system that was in place during that time. It was a long-standing complaint going back to Mr. Hill's 1980 objections to the 1979 season points scoring. An editorial boycott by Robert Osborn, the Managing Editor, Publisher and owner of BMX Action, a major BMX magazine, was over long simmering slights perceived by Mr. Osborn at ABA events but the direct cause of his boycott was his being denied a photographer's pass at an ABA national in 1980. Mr. Osborn had printed unfavorable editorials in his magazine about the ABA. As a result, ABA racing events abruptly disappeared from the pages of BMX Action after the June 1983 issue when it covered the Elsinore National. Conversely NBL Nationals and Renny Roker's NBL sanctioned ESPN Pro Spectacular races received lavish coverage, particularly the 1983 NBL Grand Nationals. It had a full 19 pages dedicated to it in the January 1984 issue. BMXA didn't even cover the ABA Grand National for 1983. In contrast in its February 1985 issue it reported with photos of the United States Bicycle Association (USBA) race at the USBMX track in Azusa, California. The USBA was as time would show not merely an archrival of the ABA but an arch enemy. The ABA was mentioned only obliquely and incidentally, which had been the case for the previous year and a half. It was not until the March 1985 issue did it cover an ABA event, the 1984 Grand National. It was 20 months since the last ABA national BMX Action had reported on. Reportedly, BMX Action ended its editorial boycott in part due to an agreement with the ABA to cease publishing its in house magazine Bicycles and Dirt.|$|E
