5|$|Modern {{scholars}} {{debate whether}} the Ming dynasty had sovereignty over Tibet. Some {{believe it was}} a relationship of loose suzerainty that was largely cut off when the Jiajing Emperor (r. 1521–67) persecuted Buddhism in favor of Daoism at court. Others argue that the significant religious nature of the relationship with Tibetan lamas is <b>underrepresented</b> <b>in</b> modern scholarship. Others note the Ming need for Central Asian horses and the need to maintain the tea-horse trade.|$|E
5|$|Stolen Childhood: Slave Youth in Nineteenth-Century America broadly {{documents}} {{nineteenth century}} slave {{children and their}} lives. It was the first full-length book on the subject, {{and at the time}} of its publishing, the topic of enslaved children was <b>underrepresented</b> <b>in</b> American slavery scholarship. The book is part of Indiana University Press's Blacks in the Diaspora series, and was first published in 1995, with a revised edition in 2011. King taught history at Michigan State University when the first edition was released.|$|E
5|$|Many more gene {{sequences}} {{are known}} than protein structures. Further, {{the set of}} solved structures is biased toward proteins {{that can be easily}} subjected to the conditions required in X-ray crystallography, one of the major structure determination methods. In particular, globular proteins are comparatively easy to crystallize in preparation for X-ray crystallography. Membrane proteins, by contrast, are difficult to crystallize and are <b>underrepresented</b> <b>in</b> the PDB. Structural genomics initiatives have attempted to remedy these deficiencies by systematically solving representative structures of major fold classes. Protein structure prediction methods attempt to provide a means of generating a plausible structure for proteins whose structures have not been experimentally determined.|$|E

5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{note that}} Tibetan leaders during the Ming frequently engaged in {{civil war and}} conducted their own foreign diplomacy with neighboring states such as Nepal. Some scholars underscore the commercial aspect of the Ming-Tibetan relationship, noting the Ming dynasty's shortage of horses for warfare and thus {{the importance of the}} horse trade with Tibet. Others argue that the significant religious nature of the relationship of the Ming court with Tibetan lamas is <b>underrepresented</b> <b>in</b> modern scholarship. In hopes of reviving the unique relationship of the earlier Mongol leader Kublai Khan (r.1260–1294) and his spiritual superior Drogön Chögyal Phagpa (1235–1280) of the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism, the Yongle Emperor (r.1402–1424) made a concerted effort to build a secular and religious alliance with Deshin Shekpa (1384–1415), the Karmapa of the Karma Kagyu school. However, the Yongle Emperor's attempts were unsuccessful.|$|E

25|$|The vast {{majority}} of programmers in open source communities are male. In a study for the European Union on free and open source software communities, researchers found that only 1.5% of all contributors are female. Although women are generally <b>underrepresented</b> <b>in</b> computing, {{the percentage of women}} in tech professions is actually much higher, close to 25%. This discrepancy suggests that female programs are overall less likely than male programmers to participate in open source projects.|$|E
25|$|Assessment of {{homology}} models {{without reference}} to the true target structure is usually performed with two methods: statistical potentials or physics-based energy calculations. Both methods produce an estimate of the energy (or an energy-like analog) for the model or models being assessed; independent criteria are needed to determine acceptable cutoffs. Neither of the two methods correlates exceptionally well with true structural accuracy, especially on protein types <b>underrepresented</b> <b>in</b> the PDB, such as membrane proteins.|$|E

First, I present the current state of <b>underrepresented</b> students <b>in</b> higher education, highlighting the Hispanic/Latino experience, as a subgroup of historically underrepresented students, and emphasizing the need to examine community colleges as they are the primary higher education destination for these students. Second, I present literature describing best practices in retention and completion for <b>underrepresented</b> students <b>in</b> higher education and, additionally, best practices in retention and completion in community colleges across the nation. Third, I explore an urban community college system in Seattle, WA, in its effort to increase the retention and completion rates of their students, of which will be evaluated against literature supporting best practices. Finally, recommendations for future programming to address both the needs of this population of students and/or other underrepresented students to create better systems towards increasing retention and completion will be offered to the community colleges explored...|$|R
25|$|On taking office, Gamsakhurdia {{was faced}} with major {{economic}} and political difficulties, especially regarding Georgia's relations with the Soviet Union. A key problem was the position of Georgia's many ethnic minorities (making up 30% of the population). Although minority groups had participated actively in Georgia's return to democracy, they were <b>underrepresented</b> <b>in</b> {{the results of the}} October 1990 elections with only nine of 245 deputies being non-Georgians. Even before Georgia's independence, the position of national minorities was contentious and led to outbreaks of serious inter-ethnic violence in Abkhazia during 1989.|$|E
25|$|Women have {{traditionally}} played a limited role in peacebuilding processes {{even though they}} often bear the responsibility for providing for their families' basic needs {{in the aftermath of}} violent conflict. They are especially likely to be unrepresented or <b>underrepresented</b> <b>in</b> negotiations, political decision-making, upper-level policymaking and senior judicial positions. Many societies' patriarchal cultures prevent them from recognizing the role women can play in peacebuilding. However, many peacebuilding academics and the United Nations have recognized that women {{play a vital role in}} securing the three pillars of sustainable peace: economic recovery and reconciliation, social cohesion and development and political legitimacy, security and governance.|$|E
25|$|Significantly, it was {{not until}} the late 1990s that al-Qaeda began {{training}} Palestinians. This is not to suggest that resistance fighters are <b>underrepresented</b> <b>in</b> the network as a number of Palestinians, mostly coming from Jordan, wanted to join and have risen to serve high-profile roles in Afghanistan. Rather, large groups such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad – which cooperate with al-Qaeda in many respects – have had difficulties accepting a strategic alliance, fearing that al-Qaeda will co-opt their smaller cells. This may have changed recently, because the Israeli security and intelligence services believe that al-Qaeda has managed to infiltrate operatives from the Occupied Territories into Israel, and is waiting for the right time to mount an attack.|$|E
