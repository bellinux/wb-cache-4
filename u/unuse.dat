5000|$|The {{statement}} about the {{consummation of the marriage}} of Gustav III made by Adolf Fredrik Munck describes the sexual history of Gustav III and thereby also the character of his relationship with Charlotte Du Rietz. In his statement, Munck reports that Gustav had only one partner before Charlotte Du Rietz, [...] "the wife of an English sea captain," [...] in Gothenburg in 1766, but neither in that case nor in the relationship with Charlotte Du Rietz was there apparently any other physical contact than touching [...] "without effect". This was the reason that the most famous courtesan of Stockholm, Catharina Norman, was hired in 1771 to remove the king's virginity. After her meeting with the monarch, Catharina Norman reported that: [...] "His Majesty is terribly shy and utterly <b>unuse</b> to it", and that it had not been possible to perform intercourse. The relationship between Charlotte Du Rietz and Gustav III was therefore likely not sexually consummated.|$|E

Such searches are inevitably misguided as nothing as complicated as language can be coded in a single gene. Indeed, it is now generally recognized that even the structure of the brain is far too complex a system to rely for its construction on a genetic program. Although the FOXP 2 gene may prevent chimpanzees from articulating language as we do (Enard et al., 2002), it does not control the development of the nervous system in a manner that would specifically inhibit language.

40|$|Abstract—Nowadays, in {{wireless}} computing, guaranteeing {{a certain}} grade of Quality of Service (QoS) during wireless sessions {{is an important}} issue, especially when non-tolerant applications are running into the system. Mobility and channel quality often affect system performance, depending on the grade of mobility of hosts. In this paper, providing QoS to mobile hosts belonging to a certain service class (Mobility Independent Predictive- MIP) is the main issue and a statistical multiplexing algorithm is proposed, {{in order to save}} an enormous amount of resources; {{it is based on the}} Cell Stay Time (CST) distribution analysis for a 2 -dimensional (2 D) wireless environment under the Smooth Random Mobility Model (SRMM). There are many works in literature about resource pre-reservation: they offer good QoS guarantees, but a very low system utilization, because they do not care about the fact that a passive reservation can remain <b>unuse...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{roles of}} iron and light as {{limiting}} and colimiting factors for phytoplankton growth in subsurface chlorophyll maxima (SCMs) were investigated in mesotrophic to oligotrophic waters of the Southern California Bight and the eastern tropical North Pacific using microcosm manipulation experiments. Phytoplankton responses indicative of iron–light colimitation were found at several SCMs underlying macronutrient-limited surface waters in the eastern Pacific. Iron additions led to {{a shift in the}} size and taxonomic structure of the phytoplankton community, where large diatoms dominated what was formerly a diverse community of relatively small phytoplankton. The strongest and most ubiquitous responses of diatoms to iron addition were found under elevated light conditions, indicating that iron availability may have the greatest potential to affect SCM phytoplankton communities when light levels increase rapidly, such as during eddy events or with strong internal waves. The results show that iron influences phytoplankton community structure at SCMs, which would have consequences for nutrient cycling and carbon export within the lower euphotic zone. It is now well established that iron can control phytoplankton biomass and productivity in high nutrient–low chlorophyll (HNLC) regions, where <b>unuse...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract Reliability-aware power {{management}} (RAPM) {{has been a}} recent research focus due {{the negative effects of}} the popular {{power management}} technique dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) on system reliability. As a result, several RAPM schemes have been proposed for uniprocessor real-time systems. In this paper, for a set of frame-based independent real-time tasks running on multiprocessor systems, we study global scheduling based RAPM (G-RAPM) schemes. Depending on how recovery blocks are scheduled and utilized, both individual-recovery and shared-recovery based G-RAPM schemes are inves-tigated. An important dimension of the G-RAPM problem is how to select the appropri-ate subset of tasks for energy and reliability management (i. e., scale down their executions while ensuring that they can be recovered from transient faults). We show that making such decision optimally (i. e., the static G-RAPM problem) is NP-hard. Then, for the individual-recovery based approach, we study two efficient heuristics, which rely on local and global task selections, respectively. For the shared-recovery based approach, a linear search based scheme is proposed. The schemes are shown to guarantee all task deadlines. Moreover, to reclaim the dynamic slack generated at runtime from early completion of tasks and <b>unuse...</b>|$|E

40|$|Despite {{unwillingness to}} fertility, about 30 % of couples {{do not use}} any kind of {{contraception}} and this will lead to unwanted pregnancy. In this clinical trial study, 4177 subjects who {{had at least one}} alive child, and delivered in one of the 12 university hospitals in Tehran were recruited. This study was conducted in 1996. The questionnaire included some questions about contraceptive use, their attitudes about unwantedness or wantedness of their current pregnancies. Data were analysed using a Logistic Regrassion Model. Results showed that 20. 3 % of those who had no fertility intention, did not use any kind of contraception methods, 41. 1 % of the subjects who were using a contraception method before pregnancy, had got pregnant unwantedly. Based on Logistic Regression Model; age, education, previous familiarity of women with contraception methods and husband's education were the most significant factors in contraceptive use. Subjects who were 20 years old and less or 35 years old and more and illeterate subjects were at higher risk for <b>unuse</b> of contraception methods. This risk was not related to the gender of their children that suggests a positive change in their perspectives towards sex and the number of children.

40|$|In this work, {{university}} {{archives and}} record management at universities have been discussed. Record management in university archives as a concept, has been first started in USA and developed the past sixty years. Short time later {{it has been}} accepted in continental Europe and then practiced in all universities of the world. It is a reality that universities {{are the most important}} institutions for the nations. By the practice of the record management, it brought together the use of institutional archives, with their workers and service for the individuals for the whole society. With the use of this concept all intellectual works could be open to all researchers. The important factor in selecting the subject is: <b>unuse</b> of document management systems in universities even they're producing scientific information and new technologies. In the most important and oldest universities in Turkey there is not such a system {{as in the case of}} Istanbul University. With this work my aim is to create a shelter for all the works to regulate the archives of University of Istanbul. In this research plenty of literature discussed and field studies have been made. Also via internet research number of articles have been collected. In this work, for the completeness of the subject, the concept of record management, its aims, document management programs firstly discussed. Under this frame, the document management in university investigated under the laws of modern archives which are suitable the functions of the institution. Secondly, after the creation of document management systems in universities which types of materials existed in universitiy archives and how would they be organised have been discussed.

40|$|This study aims to {{determine}} the communication constraints in implementing gendermainstreaming program{{in the province of}} Yogyakarta within the era of regional autonomy. The program which was initiated in 2000 has not been brought encouraging results. The qualitative research method was used with focus group data collection techniques. Head of the Office of Yogyakarta 2 ̆ 7 s Women Empowerment, head of government in the province of Yogyakarta, members of parliament as well as women activists of several women 2 ̆ 7 s NGOs were theinformants. The data from the interviews equipped with secondary data collected from the annual report from the Office of Women 2 ̆ 7 s Empowerment and all government agencies in the province of Yogyakarta. All data was then analyzed using descriptive-qualitative analysis. The results of this study found that implementa- tion of mainstreaming in all offices in Yogyakarta were not optimized, but the Education Department has a good gender responsive planning, implementation, and evaluation of programs. This study also identified a variety of communication barriers in the implementation of Gender Mainstreaming in Yogyakarta Province agencies, namely: cultural aspects of society 2 ̆ 7 s perception that support patriar- chy, perception of gender, resulting in work programs and behaviors that gender bias, the absence of data between men and women as a basis for making the program work, the <b>unuse</b> of gender analysis tools in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of work programs, the existence of mutations that are less concerned employee PUG experience, and budget issues that have not been gender responsive. Thus, this study suggests that the government should have the same perception of gender as a basis for making the program work and implemented in a gender responsive planning, implementation, and evaluation of programs. It needs to be supported by personnel in all offices that have a correct perception of the gender mainstreaming, for the sake of harmony and well-being of society, especially in the government of Yogyakarta...|$|E

This study was designed to determine the respective roles that change facilitators [...] parents, teachers, principals, and superintendents [...] perceive for themselves in areas related to educational change and development. Role perceptions were compared to reveal areas of agreement and difference. Selected school characteristics were analyzed to determine their possible affect on the perceptions of the respondents. Data for this study were collected using two instruments [...] a questionnaire and the Role Norm Inventory. The questionnaire contained five items and was developed to determine the attitudes of parents, teachers, and principals toward the activities of parent-teacher groups and advisory committees. The Role Norm Inventory contained 58 norm statements from five specific categories. These categories were: Role with Community; Role in School Management; Role with Children; Role with Curriculum; and Role with Staff. It was used to determine the roles that respondents perceived for members of their respective groups. The study was conducted in 15 Cook County school districts outside Chicago. Twenty-six schools participated. Returns of 80. 15 % of parents, 77. 28 % of teachers, 96. 15 % of principals, and 86. 66 % of superintendents were received. The chi-square test was used to analyze the data by the presence of either a PTA or a PTO, by the use or <b>unuse</b> of advisory committees, by the perceived impact of the PTA/PTO on change, and by the perceived impact of advisory committees on change. The following conclusions were based on the findings: (1) Parents, teachers, principals, and superintendents each desire a major role in educational change and development. (2) More than one group of change facilitators will often desire involvement with the same role. (3) PTA/PTO's are perceived as performing many important functions in the schools, but only principals as a group reported a majority feeling that such groups have impact on change. (4) Advisory committees have been used {{in a wide variety of}} areas in the schools, but less than half of the parents, teachers, and principals reported that these committees have impact on change. (5) There are significant differences between the role perceptions of the respondent groups. (6) There is probably no difference in parent attitudes toward involvement in educational change and development regardless of whether the school has a PTA or a PTO. (7) The use of advisory committees seems to be related to the desire for parent involvement in roles with curriculum. (8) Having a PTA/PTO, which is perceived as having an impact on change, seems to be related to the desire for parent involvement in roles with community and with curriculum. (9) Advisory committees, which are perceived as having an impact on change, seem to be related to the desire for involvement by parents in roles with community, with curriculum, and with staff. There is also strong evidence that the inverse is equally true. (10) There are some differences in teachers' attitudes toward change depending on whether the school has a PTA or a PTO. (11) The use of advisory committees seems to be related to the desire for participation by teachers in roles in school management. (12) The perceived impact of the PTA/PTO has some relationship to teacher involvement in educational change and development. (13) The perceived impact of advisory committees seems to have little or no relationship to teacher involvement in educational change and development. Education will continue to change. Perusal of the study's findings and conclusions should foster understanding and promote cooperative action between all who are concerned with the pursuit of excellence in education...|$|E
