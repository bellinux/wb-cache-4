5|$|Hazlitt then {{comments}} {{on some of}} the other characters seen not in isolation but as they interact with and affect one another, comparing and contrasting them to highlight subtle differences. For example, the characters of Goneril and Regan, the comparison of which he begins with a note of personal distaste ("they are so thoroughly hateful that we do not even like to repeat their names"), are shown, he points out, partly in their reaction to their sister Cordelia's desire that they treat their father well—Prescribe not to <b>us</b> <b>our</b> duties—and partly by the contrast of their hypocrisy with the candor of the otherwise evil Edmund.|$|E

6000|$|They {{never say}} unkind things. They never tell <b>us</b> of <b>our</b> faults, [...] "merely {{for our own}} good." [...] They do not at {{inconvenient}} moments mildly remind <b>us</b> of <b>our</b> past follies and mistakes. They do not say, [...] "Oh, yes, a lot of use you are if you are ever really wanted"--sarcastic like. They never inform <b>us,</b> like <b>our</b> inamoratas sometimes do, {{that we are not}} nearly so nice as we used to be. We are always the same to them.|$|R

25|$|The {{school had}} three badges during its history. The {{first was the}} Bath Technical College badge which was a simple design - BTC in thin red letters within a shield {{outlined}} with a thin red line- and this lasted until the Bath Technical School was renamed in 1949. The second badge lasted until early 1954 and is recorded on the school photograph of March 1950 and the school website. The third badge, which lasted until 1970, was designed in early 1954 by Mr Ken Box, Head of Art and included the motto, 'NISI DOMINUS FRUSTRA'. The literal translation is 'UNLESS THE LORD IN VAIN'. This is not much help. The motto is based on Psalm 127 and the more usual translation is 'EXCEPT THE LORD APPROVE WE LABOUR IN VAIN' while another translation might be 'UNLESS THE LORD IS WITH <b>US</b> <b>OUR</b> EFFORTS ARE IN VAIN'.The badge has the Book of Knowledge open to show the motto, over the City wall with the Avon beneath. The open pages are white with yellow ends, the City wall is yellow, the river Avon white and the background a shade of blue.|$|E
25|$|From 1860 many {{attempts}} {{were made by the}} Persian Jewish community to secure assistance from European Jews against Muslims. These requests were full of descriptions of poverty and persecution faced by Jews in Persia. The following is one example of such requests :"Allow us to present our supplications to you. You would not want your brethren, your own flesh and blood, to perish in frightful penury, to be victims of renewed persecutions which awaits them with each passing day. We are subject to the scorn of our enemies (Muslims) who view us as defenseless and do with us whatever they like. We live every day, hour and moment of our lives in constant dread of some new tragedy which they might bring upon <b>us.</b> <b>our</b> lives, property, honor, everything that is dear to us is at the mercy of their anger and hostility, a situation which is worse than slavery. Apostate Jews have the right to inherit their parents entire estate, the widow and orphans who did not abandon their faith must hand over their property to the apostate. A Muslim who kills a Jew will not go to a trial, even if there were witnesses to the crime, the Muslim will pay at most a fine for his deed. We are groaning under the burden of disgraceful taxes.|$|E

The Moon Matrix is a broadcast from that spacecraft to the human body–computer, specifically to the left hemisphere of the brain, which gives <b>us</b> <b>our</b> sense of reality: [...] "We {{are living in a}} dreamworld within a dreamworld—a Matrix within the virtual-reality universe—and it is being broadcast from the Moon."
