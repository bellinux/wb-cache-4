25|$|With {{the help}} of Bathory, however, the scales soon turned in the {{opposite}} direction. Six months after his humiliating peace with the Polish monarch, Ivan IV was glad to conclude a truce with Sweden also on a <b>uti</b> <b>possidetis</b> basis at Plussa, on August 5, 1582. The war was resumed by Russians {{as soon as the}} truce expired, leading to the Treaty of Tyavzino, far less advantageous for Sweden.|$|E
25|$|On 13 September 1433 a truce {{was signed}} at Jasiniec. Polish–Teutonic {{negotiations}} continued at Brześć Kujawski, and Hussite–Catholic negotiations continued at the Council of Florence {{and at the}} Czech Diet in Prague. The Polish-led invasion of Neumark and Pomerania had proven successful, cutting the Teutonic Order off from support from the Holy Roman Empire, and convincing the Order to sign a treaty with the Poles. On 15 December 1433, twelve-year Truce of Łęczyca was signed between the Poles and the Order at Łęczyca (leading some Polish historians to divide this Polish–Teutonic War into two wars: in 1431–1433; and in 1435). The Teutonic Knights agreed {{to most of the}} Polish demands, including that the Order cease its support for Švitrigaila, each side would control the territories that it occupied until a peace was signed (<b>uti</b> <b>possidetis),</b> and no party would seek mediation by foreign powers in order to alter this truce. This marked {{the end of the war}} on Polish soil; the struggle on Lithuanian lands would continue for two more years, as the truce with Poland did not extend to the Livonian Order.|$|E

Pakistan believes, and international convention under <b>uti</b> <b>possidetis</b> juris supports, the position that it should not require an agreement to set the boundary; courts in several countries around the world and the Vienna Convention have universally upheld via <b>uti</b> <b>possidetis</b> juris that binding bilateral agreements are [...] "passed down" [...] to successor states. Thus, a unilateral declaration by one party has no effect; boundary changes must be made bilaterally.|$|E

60|$|I {{have looked}} back upon our conduct and our public conversations {{in order to}} {{discover}} {{what it is that}} can have given you offence. I have done so, because I am ready to admit that to offend you without any cause would be as contrary to true policy as I am sure it must be to the inclinations of almost every one of us. About two years ago Lord Nugent moved six propositions in favor of Ireland in the House of Commons. At the time of the motions, and during the debate, Lord North was either wholly out of the House, or engaged in other matters of business or pleasantry, in the remotest recesses of the West Saxon corner. He took no part whatsoever in the affair; but it was supposed his neutrality was more inclined towards the side of favor. The mover being a person in office was, however, the only indication that was given of such a leaning. We who supported the propositions, finding them better relished than at first we looked for, pursued our advantage, and began to open a way for more essential benefits to Ireland. On the other hand, those who had hitherto opposed them in vain redoubled their efforts, and became exceedingly clamorous. Then it was that Lord North found it necessary to come out of his fastness, and to interpose between the contending parties. In this character of mediator, he declared, that, if anything beyond the first six resolutions should be attempted, he would oppose the whole, but that, if we rested there, the original motions should have his support. On this a sort of convention took place between him and the managers of the Irish business, in which the six resolutions were to be considered as an <b>uti</b> <b>possidetis,</b> and to be held sacred.|$|E
60|$|Whether {{it would}} not be good policy for the general {{government}} to assume all the wild lands in the rebellious States, and to devote the proceeds of their sale to actual settlers to the payment of the national debt, is worth consideration. Texas alone, on whose public lands our assumption of her indebtedness gives us an equitable claim, would suffice to secure our liabilities and to lighten our taxation, and in all cases of land granted to freedmen no title should vest till a fair price had been paid,--a principle no less essential to their true interests than our own. That these people, who are to be the peasantry of the future Southern States, should be made landholders, is the main condition of a healthy regeneration of that part of the country, and the one warranty of our rightful repossession of it. The wealth that makes a nation really strong, and not merely rich, is the opportunity for industry, intelligence, and well-being of its laboring population. This is the real country of poor men, as the great majority must always be. No glories of war or art, no luxurious refinement of the few, can give them a sense of nationality where this is wanting. If we free the slave without giving him a right in the soil, and the inducement to industry which this offers, we reproduce only a more specious form of all the old abuses. We leave all political {{power in the hands of}} the wealthy landholders, where it was before. We leave the poorer whites unemancipated, for we leave labor still at the mercy of capital, and with its old stigma of degradation. Blind to the lessons of all experience, we deliberately make the South what Ireland was when Arthur Young travelled there, the country richest in the world by nature, reduced to irredeemable poverty and hopeless weakness by an upper class who would not, and a lower class who could not, improve. We have no right to purchase dominion, no right to purchase even abolition, at such a price as that. No <b>uti</b> <b>possidetis</b> conveys any legitimate title, except on the condition of wise administration and mutual benefit.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Uti</b> <b>possidetis</b> juris or <b>uti</b> <b>possidetis</b> iuris (Latin for [...] "as you possess under law") is a {{principle}} of international law which provides that newly formed sovereign states {{should have the same}} borders that their preceding dependent area had before their independence.|$|E
50|$|<b>Uti</b> <b>possidetis</b> juris is a {{modified}} form of uti possidetis; {{created for the}} purpose of avoiding terra nullius, the original version of <b>uti</b> <b>possidetis</b> began as a Roman law governing the rightful possession of property. During the medieval period it evolved into a law governing international relations and has recently been modified for situations of newly independent states.|$|E
5000|$|The court {{rejected}} {{both the}} <b>uti</b> <b>possidetis</b> principle and the oceanic principle because: ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Uti</b> <b>possidetis</b> (Latin for [...] "as you possess") is a {{principle}} {{in international law}} that territory and other property remains with its possessor {{at the end of}} a conflict, unless otherwise provided for by treaty; if such a treaty does not include conditions regarding the possession of property and territory taken during the war, then the principle of <b>uti</b> <b>possidetis</b> will prevail. Originating in Roman law, the phrase is derived from the Latin expression <b>uti</b> <b>possidetis,</b> ita possideatis, meaning [...] "may you continue to possess such as you do possess" [...] (lit., [...] "as you possess, thus may you possess"). This principle enables a belligerent party to claim territory that it has acquired by war.|$|E

50|$|In 1856, {{the treaty}} of {{friendship}} between Chile and Argentina that recognized boundaries was enacted <b>uti</b> <b>possidetis</b> juris, that is, those defined by the Spanish Empire until 1810.|$|E
50|$|That, in {{addition}} to <b>uti</b> <b>possidetis</b> juris, sovereignty was obtained when the islands were formally claimed in Argentina's name in 1820, followed by Argentina's confirmation and effective occupation from 1826 to 1833.|$|E
50|$|In particular, remote regions, sparsely {{populated}} or uninhabited areas, inhospitable climate, and sparse local vegetation caused {{a lack of}} geographical knowledge and hence administrative determination of the borders. But political unrest also led to changes, like the province of Tarija in colonial Argentina, which after independence wanted to come under Bolivian administration. On the other hand, European powers and the USA never recognized the principle of <b>Uti</b> <b>possidetis</b> 1810, as for example in the Falkland Islands. Since uncertainty characterized the demarcation of frontiers according to the <b>Uti</b> <b>possidetis</b> 1810, several long-running border conflicts arose in America after independence throughout the 19th century.|$|E

50|$|More recently, the {{principle}} {{has been used}} in a modified form (see <b>Uti</b> <b>possidetis</b> juris) to establish the frontiers of newly independent states following decolonization, by ensuring that the frontiers followed the original boundaries of the old colonial territories from which they emerged. This use originated in South America in the 19th century with the withdrawal of the Spanish Empire. By declaring that <b>uti</b> <b>possidetis</b> applied, the new states sought to ensure that there was no terra nullius in South America when the Spanish withdrew and to reduce the likelihood of border wars between the newly independent states and the establishment of new European colonies.|$|E
5000|$|Applying the {{principle}} of <b>uti</b> <b>possidetis</b> {{with regard to the}} Treaty of Taipei would grant Taiwan's sovereignty to the ROC, as it is undisputed that at the coming into force of the treaty, the ROC controlled Taiwan.|$|E
50|$|The Treaty of Breda, {{which brought}} {{an end to}} the war, was largely on the basis of <b>uti</b> <b>possidetis,</b> and saw Willoughbyland ceded. The English never regained {{sovereignty}} over Suriname, and Byam's authority in the area duly disintegrated.|$|E
50|$|Even {{though it}} is {{unlikely}} that Ecuador might have concocted a historical treaty of this nature, the Peruvian arguments cannot be dismissed out of hand. However, considering the <b>uti</b> <b>possidetis</b> juris principle Ecuador would maintain the borders ratified right before Gran Colombia's dissolution.|$|E
50|$|Mata {{replied to}} Cavero on November 30, arguing that Ecuador had full {{rights to the}} territories, reaffirming Ecuador's view that the Real Cédula of 1802 did not {{transfer}} territorial rights to the Viceroyalty of Peru, rendering the claim of <b>uti</b> <b>possidetis</b> de jure void. According to one source, Mata argued that the Real Cédula of 1802 did not constitute a real Spanish law, because it was never authorized by the Viceroy of Santa Fe, meaning that ownership of territories according to Spanish law remained as it was prior to 1802. Peru continued to stand by its position of <b>uti</b> <b>possidetis</b> of 1810, and brought its case before {{the governments of the}} United States and Great Britain, which distanced themselves from the dispute.|$|E
50|$|After {{achieving}} {{its independence}} from Spain in 1818, Chile held control of territory spanning roughly the same boundaries of the colonial general captaincy that was {{under the control of}} the Spanish Empire's Viceroyalty of Peru. Under the <b>uti</b> <b>possidetis</b> iuris principle that delimited the international boundaries of the independent South American states, Chile bordered at its north with Bolivia in the Atacama Desert and at its east with Argentina. To the south Chile claimed all lands west of the Andes but controlled only the area down to Bío Bío River plus the area between Valdivia and Chiloé, with the rest either belonging to independent Mapuche of Araucanía or being sparsely populated by other tribes. The <b>uti</b> <b>possidetis</b> system proved ephemeral, nonetheless; the lack of formal border treaties caused disputes throughout the continent.|$|E
50|$|<b>Uti</b> <b>possidetis</b> is {{a general}} principle, which is logically {{connected}} with the phenomenon of obtaining independence, wherever it occurs. Its obvious purpose is to prevent the independence and stability of new states being endangered by fratricidal struggles provoked by the changing of frontiers following {{the withdrawal of the}} administering power.|$|E

50|$|The {{term was}} {{originally}} used in treaties {{to refer to}} the withdrawal of enemy troops and the restoration of prewar leadership.

This contrasts with <b>uti</b> <b>possidetis,</b> where each side retains whatever territory and other property it holds {{at the end of the}} war.|$|E
