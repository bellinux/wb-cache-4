25|$|Placental {{expulsion}} can {{be managed}} actively or it {{can be managed}} expectantly, allowing the placenta to be expelled without medical assistance. Active management is described as the administration of a <b>uterotonic</b> drug within one minute of fetal delivery, controlled traction of the umbilical cord and fundal massage after delivery of the placenta, followed by performance of uterine massage every 15 minutes for two hours. In a joint statement, World Health Organization, the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics and the International Confederation of Midwives recommend active management of the third stage of labour in all vaginal deliveries to help to prevent postpartum hemorrhage.|$|E
25|$|A Cochrane review {{suggests}} that active management (use of <b>uterotonic</b> drugs, cord clamping and controlled cord traction) {{during the third}} stage of labour reduces severe bleeding and anemia. However, the review also found that active management increased the mother's blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, and pain. In the active management group more women returned to hospital with bleeding after discharge, {{and there was also}} a reduction in birthweight due to infants having a lower blood volume. The effects on the baby of early cord clamping was discussed in another review which found that delayed cord clamping improved iron stores longer term in the infants. Although {{they were more likely to}} need phototherapy (light therapy) to treat jaundice, the improved iron stores are expected to be worth increasing the practice of delayed cord clamping in healthy term babies. For preterm babies (babies born before 37 weeks) a review of the research found that delaying cord clamping by 30–45 seconds increased the amount of blood flow to the baby. This is important as increased blood volume in the baby made them less likely to develop some serious complications. Much of the research around this subject is poor quality so further, larger research projects are likely to produce more reliable results.|$|E

40|$|Objective: aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} current knowledge and practice regarding AMTSL in midwifery practices and obstetric departments in the Netherlands. Design: web-based and postal questionnaire. Setting: in August and September 2011 a questionnaire was sent to all midwifery practices and all obstetric departments in the Netherlands. Participants: all midwifery practices (528) and all obstetric departments (91) in the Netherlands. Measurements and findings: the response was 87. 5 %. Administering prophylactic <b>uterotonics</b> was seen as a component AMTSL by virtually all respondents; 96. 1 % of midwives and 98. 8 % of obstetricians. Cord clamping was found as a component of AMTSL by 87. 4 % of midwives and by 88. 1 % of obstetricians. Uterine massage was only seen as a component of AMTSL by 10 % of the midwives and 20. 2 % of the obstetricians. Midwifery practices routinely administer oxytocin in 60. 1 % of births. Obstetric departments do so in 97. 6 % (. p< 0. 01). Compared to 1995, the prophylactic use of oxytocin had increased in 2011 both by midwives (10 - 59. 1 %) and by obstetricians (55 - 96. 4 %) (. p< 0. 01). Key conclusions: prophylactic administration of <b>uterotonics</b> directly after childbirth is perceived as the essential part of AMTSL. The administration of <b>uterotonics</b> has significantly increased in the last decade, but is not standard practice in the low-risk population supervised by midwives. Implications for practice: the evidence for prophylactic administration of <b>uterotonics</b> is convincing for women who are at high risk of PPH. Regarding the lack of evidence of AMTSL to prevent PPH in low risk (home) births, further research concerning low-risk (home) births, supervised by midwives in industrialised countries is indicated. A national guideline containing best practices concerning management of the third stage of labour supervised by midwives, should be composed and implemented. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

Once placental or traumatic etiologies have been excluded, <b>uterotonics</b> and hemostatic obstetrical maneuvers must be initiated.

40|$|Preterm birth (PTB) is {{the leading}} cause of {{neonatal}} mortality and morbidity, with few prevention and treatment options. Uterine contraction is a central feature of PTB, so gaining new insights into the mechanisms of this contraction and consequently identifying novel targets for tocolytics are essential for more successful management of PTB. Here we report that myometrial cells from human and mouse express bitter taste receptors (TAS 2 Rs) and their canonical signaling components (i. e., G-protein gustducin and phospholipase C beta 2). Bitter tastants can completely relax myometrium precontracted by different <b>uterotonics.</b> In isolated single mouse myometrial cells, a phenotypical bitter tastant (chloroquine, ChQ) reverses the rise in intracellular Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) and cell shortening induced by <b>uterotonics,</b> and this reversal effect is inhibited by pertussis toxin and by genetic deletion of alpha-gustducin. In human myometrial cells, knockdown of TAS 2 R 14 but not TAS 2 R 10 inhibits ChQ 2 ̆ 7 s reversal effect on an oxytocin-induced rise in [Ca 2 +]i Finally, ChQ prevents mouse PTBs induced by bacterial endotoxin LPS or progesterone receptor antagonist mifepristone more often than current commonly used tocolytics, and this prevention is largely lost in alpha-gustducin knockout mice. Collectively, our results reveal that activation of the canonical TAS 2 R signaling system in myometrial cells produces profound relaxation of myometrium precontracted by a broad spectrum of contractile agonists, and that targeting TAS 2 Rs is an attractive approach to developing effective tocolytics for PTB management...|$|R

40|$|Background: While {{inferior}} to oxytocin injection in both efficacy and safety, orally administered misoprostol has {{been included in}} the World Health Organization Model List of Essential Medicines for use in the prevention of postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) in low-resource settings. This study evaluates the costs and health outcomes of use of oral misoprostol to prevent PPH in settings where injectable <b>uterotonics</b> are not available. Methods: A cost-consequences analysis was conducted from the international health system perspective, using data from a recent Cochrane systematic review and WHO's Mother-Baby Package Costing Spreadsheet in a hypothetical cohort of 1000 births in a mixed hospital (40 % births) /community setting (60 % births). Costs were estimated based on 2012 US dollars. Results: Using oxytocin in the hospital setting and misoprostol in the community setting in a cohort of 1000 births, instead of oxytocin (hospital setting) and no treatment (community setting), 22 cases of PPH could be prevented. Six fewer women would require additional <b>uterotonics</b> and four fewer women a blood transfusion. An additional 130 women would experience shivering and an extra 42 women fever. Oxytocin/misoprostol was found to be cost saving (US$ 320) compared to oxytocin/no treatment. Conclusions: Our findings confirm that, even though misoprostol is not the optimum choice in the prevention of PPH, misoprostol could be an effective and cost-saving choice where oxytocin is not or cannot be used {{due to a lack of}} skilled birth attendants, inadequate transport and storage facilities or where a quality assured oxytocin product is not available. These benefits need to be weighed against the large number of additional side effects such as shivering and fever, which have been described as tolerable and of short duration...|$|R
50|$|Fundal massage, {{also called}} uterine massage, is a {{technique}} used to reduce bleeding and cramping of the uterus after childbirth or after an abortion. As the uterus returns to its nonpregnant size, its muscles contract strongly, which can cause pain. Fundal massage can be performed with one hand over the pubic bone, firmly massaging the uterine fundus (the top of the uterus), or {{with the addition of}} one hand in the vagina compressing the two uterine arteries. Routine use of fundal massage can prevent postpartum or post-abortion hemorrhage and can reduce pain; it may also reduce the need for <b>uterotonics,</b> medications that cause the uterus to contract. It is used to treat uterine atony, a condition where the uterus lacks muscle tone and is soft to the touch instead of firm.|$|R

50|$|During pregnancy, the {{synthesis}} of oxytocin receptors in the uterus greatly increases, reaching a peak during labor and delivery. Consequently, the administration of carbetocin or another oxytocin analog during or immediately following birth will have increased <b>uterotonic</b> and contractile effect. The application of carbetocin does not affect a non-pregnant uterus with lower oxytocin receptor expression. Carbetocin also functions to thicken the blood, further preventing post-partum hemorrhage. Carbetocin {{should not be used}} to induce or augment labor since it could cause cardiac or respiratory distress to mother or infant.|$|E
50|$|Carbetocin {{is to be}} used in the {{hospital}} by prescription only. It can be administered intravenously or intramuscularly. In both cases, the recommended dose for an average adult female is 100 ug. Contractile effects of the uterus are apparent within two minutes and can be observed for approximately one hour, though maximum binding occurs about 30 minutes after intramuscular injection. Administration is performed immediately following parturition to minimize risk of postpartum hemorrhage by inducing uterine contractions, increasing muscle tone and thickening the blood. If further uterine stimulation is needed, treatment with other forms of oxytocic <b>uterotonic</b> drugs should be used.|$|E
40|$|Haemorrhage is {{a common}} {{complication}} of childbirth with 0. 65 % of deliveries associated with significant (> 1500 mL) peripartum blood loss.

Fibrinogen concentrate offers rapid restoration of fibrinogen levels with a small volume infusion and minimal preparation time. It is effective in treating patients with congenital hypofibrinogenaemia, but there are few reports of its use in association with continuing obstetric haemorrhage. Six cases of obstetric haemorrhage, associated with hypofibrinogenaemia, treated with fibrinogen concentrate in conjunction with platelets, fresh frozen plasma, packed red blood cells, <b>uterotonics</b> and obstetric intervention are described.

Methods: We combined published data from pre-intervention/NASG-intervention clinical trials with costs from study sites. For each country, we used observed proportions of initial shock level (mild: {{mean arterial pressure}} [MAP]. 60 mmHg; severe: MAP # 60 mmHg) to define a standard population of 1, 000 women presenting in shock. We examined three intervention scenarios: no women in shock receive the NASG, only women in severe shock receive the NASG, and all women in shock receive the NASG. Clinical data included frequencies of adverse health outcomes (mortality, severe morbidity, severe anemia), and interventions to manage bleeding (<b>uterotonics,</b> blood transfusions, hysterectomies).
