40|$|When United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) was {{established}} {{by the end of}} 1945, Joseph Needham (1900 - 1995) and some progressive scientists were recruited to build the Natural Sciences Department. Needham was supported by Julian Huxley (1887 - 1975), the first Director general, also issued from the social relations of Science Movement of the 1930 s. Needham’s agenda was a complete re-foundation of the international scientific relations, applying in particular a ‘Periphery Principle’, according to which UNESCO’s priority was to be turned towards the countries which needed the most a scientific development. Such a principle opened a space within <b>UNESCO’s</b> <b>Secretariat</b> for scientists coming from Latin America, India or China, a conscious political geographically-oriented action. This principle also lead UNESCO to attempt the creation of an international research institute in the Amazon Region; to establish a Field Scientific Co-operation Office (firstly in Rio, afterwards in Montevideo); and finally to organize in Montevideo (September 1948) the first Latin American Conference for the Development and the Organization of Science (LACDOS) ...|$|R

40|$|This {{doctoral}} research investigates {{possibilities and}} limitations of 'education borrowing' in Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago {{in the midst of}} competing objectives of improving quality in secondary education, encouragement of 'sharing' by the international community and the impulses towards the 'centre'. Two types of 'borrowing' are identified. The first involves 'horizontal borrowing', in which countries borrow from each other in the manner suggested by <b>UNESCO</b> and Commonwealth <b>Secretariat</b> policy documents. The second involves 'vertical borrowing' in which states are influenced by policies from the 'centre', usually countries of powerful significance due to relationships with the metropole or in the bid to raise achievement. The thesis analyzes literature on both types of 'education borrowing' and identifies policies encouraging 'horizontal borrowing' by the international community. Fieldwork was undertaken to identify pulses of foreign influence and innovation for policies in Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago. 50 interviews and 87 hours of observation for the purpose of triangulation took place between January - November 2007. Respondents include teachers, heads of departments, senior school managers, policymakers, local academics and members of regional and international institutions. Mathematics curricula and teaching were selected as the focus for examining policy. Drawing on the policy review and fieldwork data, patterns of policy 'borrowing' in the Caribbean are uncovered and considerations for policymakers are noted. There are two main findings: 1) Despite encouragement by <b>UNESCO</b> and Commonwealth <b>Secretariat</b> policy documents, {{there was no evidence of}} 'horizontal borrowing' between Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago and 2) Possibilities for cross-national attraction were limited due to the overriding attention paid to the global 'centre' for 'vertical borrowing' rather than concern for regional growth and cohesion. There appear to be three tenets of limitations to 'horizontal borrowing': 1) Island policymakers look internationally for innovation, thereby rejecting policies advocating 'borrowing' from each other; 2) Sharing is not part of the island histories and cultures; and 3) Forces of tradition bind existing teaching and education values. Although some of the implications of this thesis may be valuable in other contexts, the findings cannot be extrapolated to the whole of the Caribbean, to other small states or to developing countries in general. As states are often treated similarly in policies advocating 'horizontal borrowing', more analysis is needed to unpack patterns of influence, dynamics of change and the needs of under-researched countries...|$|R

Further to this, and thanks to the generous contribution from the Government of Japan, the Executive Secretary of the CBD and the Assistant- Director General for Natural Sciences of UNESCO jointly convened an informal diversity liaison group (DLG) composed of experts working on biological and cultural diversity issues, along with funders and potential donors (refer to notification 2012 - 050). The Diversity Liaison Group met at the UNESCO Liaison Office in New York on 28 - 29 April 2012. The report of the meeting is available as UNEP/CBD/COP/ 11 /INF/ 11.

5000|$|The lead {{organization}} for the International Year was UNESCO. There was a logic to this, in that UNESCO is the United Nations organization dealing with education, and also in that the constitutional mandate of UNESCO involves the encouragement of a global culture of peace. Within the <b>UNESCO</b> <b>Secretariat</b> in Paris, a specific International Year for the Culture of Peace Taskforce was established from 1998 to 2000, {{with the aim of}} co-ordinating the activities to publicize the International Year. Members of the Taskforce included: David Adams (Chair), Enzo Fazzino, [...] Di Bretherton, Katherine Stoessel, Zeynep Varoglu [...] and Jan Visser.|$|E
50|$|The Secretariat of the Iranian National Commission for UNESCO is {{the body}} in charge of {{implementing}} UNESCO programmes and activities at the Country level. The Secretariat also follows-up adoptions of the Supreme Council in coordination with the Executive Council. The secretariat of the Iranian National Commission for UNESCO has a structure similar to the <b>UNESCO</b> <b>secretariat</b> at Headquarters, in Paris. The Secretariat is thus composed of programme sectors, logistics and service divisions. On an organizational basis the Secretariat of the Iranian National Commission for UNESCO is affiliated to the Ministry of Science, Research and Technology. The Secretariat is managed by the Secretary General of the Iranian National Commission for UNESCO.|$|E
50|$|International {{cooperation}} is primarily coordinated by the UNESCO.

This committee convenes annually and is supported by the <b>UNESCO</b> <b>Secretariat</b> (Second Protocol, Art. 28). Every four years, the signatory states report to the committee on the implementation of the Second Protocol. In 2015, with the revision of the Act on the Protection of Cultural Property, the stipulations of the Second Protocol, which Switzerland ratified in 2004, will be integral part of Swiss law. Switzerland has already collaborated bilaterally with various countries, for example with the Czech Republic, Germany and Norway.|$|E
50|$|The Buenavista Protected Landscape is a {{conservation}} area and an archaeological site located on Bondoc Peninsula {{in the southern}} Luzon province of Quezon in the Philippines. It conserves an important watershed area composed of secondary-growth forest, grassland and coconut land in the rural village of Buenavista within the coastal municipality of Mulanay. The area was primarily set aside for watershed protection and timber production in 1937 covering approximately 356 ha. In 2000, it was reestablished as a protected landscape area under the National Integrated Protected Areas System. The area {{is known as the}} site of an ancient village containing unique limestone graves discovered in 2011.

40|$|The Guidelines for Quality Provision in Cross-Border Higher Education were {{developed}} and adopted {{to support and}} encourage international cooperation and enhance {{the understanding of the}} importance of quality provision in cross-border higher education. The purposes of the Guidelines are to protect students and other stakeholders from low-quality provision and disreputable providers (that is, degree and accreditation mills) as well as to encourage the development of quality cross-border higher education that meets human, social, economic and cultural needs. The Guidelines are not legally binding and member countries are expected to implement them as appropriate in their national context. Based on a survey about the main recommendations of the Guidelines, this report monitors the extent to which OECD countries and a few non-member countries comply with its recommendations. The Survey was sent out in June 2010 to all OECD countries. The Secretariat has also collaborated with the <b>UNESCO</b> <b>Secretariat</b> to have the questionnaire sent to all UNESCO non-OECD country delegations. Twenty-three responses were obtained from 22 Members: Australia, Austria, Belgium (Flemish and French communities), Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Netherlands, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States; and 9 non-Members: Bulgaria, Colombia, Fiji, Indonesia, Jordan, Kyrgyzstan, Lithuania, Oman, Rwanda. Government representatives were asked to co-ordinate with the other stakeholders covered to answer the survey. The main conclusion of the survey is that (responding) countries report a high level of compliance with the Guidelines recommendations. On average, responding OECD countries conform to 72 % of the main recommendations made to governments, tertiary education institutions, and quality assurance and accreditation agencies. The level of compliance decreases to 67 % when recommendations to student bodies are included, but the level of missing information, and thus uncertainty about actual compliance, increases significantly...|$|E
