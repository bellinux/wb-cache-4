2500|$|Less common are {{unilateral}} {{contracts in}} which one party makes a promise, but the other side does not promise anything. In these cases, those accepting the offer {{are not required to}} communicate their acceptance to the offeror. In a reward contract, for example, a person who has lost a dog could promise a reward if the dog is found, through publication or orally. The payment could be additionally conditioned on the dog being returned alive. Those who learn of the reward are not required to search for the dog, but if someone finds the dog and delivers it, the promisor is required to pay. In the similar case of advertisements of deals or bargains, a general rule is that these are not contractual offers but merely an [...] "invitation to treat" [...] (or bargain), but the applicability of this rule is disputed and contains various exceptions. The High Court of Australia stated that the term <b>unilateral</b> <b>contract</b> is [...] "unscientific and misleading".|$|E
2500|$|Another case {{involved}} the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (MPD). In 2007, newly appointed MPD Chief of Police Cathy L. Lanier announced the [...] "All Hands on Deck" [...] policy, {{in which all}} 4,000 MPD officers worked for three straight days to patrol high-crime neighborhoods and execute arrest warrants. Several [...] "All Hands on Deck" [...] periods occurred in 2007, 2008, and 2009. The Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), a labor union representing police officers in the District of Columbia, filed six to 10 grievances over the practice, claiming it violated {{the collective bargaining agreement}} and broke D.C. law. In September 2009, Truesdale filed an arbitrator's report in which he held that the MPD forced officers to change vacation days and tours of duty in violation of the union contract, failed to bargain with the FOP over these <b>unilateral</b> <b>contract</b> changes, and ordered the city to halt the [...] "All Hands on Deck" [...] initiative. He also ordered the MPD to pay overtime (with interest) to those officers who worked extra shifts. Lanier said would appeal the ruling to the Public Employee Relations Board and the courts.|$|E

50|$|A problem arises with <b>unilateral</b> <b>contracts</b> {{because of}} the late {{formation}} of the <b>contract.</b> With classical <b>unilateral</b> <b>contracts,</b> a promisor can revoke his offer for the contract at any point prior to the promisee's complete performance. So, if a promisee provides 99% of the performance sought, the promisor could then revoke without any remedy for the promisee.

50|$|The option {{contract}} provides {{an important role}} in <b>unilateral</b> <b>contracts.</b> In <b>unilateral</b> <b>contracts,</b> the promisor seeks acceptance by performance from the promisee. In this scenario, the classical contract view was that a contract is not formed until the performance that the promisor seeks is completely performed. This is because the consideration for the contract was the performance of the promisee. Once the promisee performed completely, consideration is satisfied and a contract is formed and only the promisor is bound to his promise.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Social {{commitments}} {{are developed}} for multi-agent systems {{according to the}} current practice in law regarding contract formation and breach. Deafeasible commitments are used to provide a useful link between multi-agent systems and legal doctrines. The proposed model makes the commitments more expressive relative to contract law, improving {{the model for the}} life cycle of the commitments. As a consequence, the broader semantics helps in modelling different types of contracts: gratuitous promises, <b>unilateral</b> <b>contracts,</b> bilateral contracts, and forward contracts. The semantics of higher-order commitments is useful in deciding whether to sign an agreement or not, due to a larger variety of protocols and contracts. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper,we {{are debating}} {{the problem of}} the {{relationship}} between the civil juristic document and the contract. The civil juristic document was defined as [...] . „a manifestation of will with the intention of producing juristic effects, meaning the birth, change and cancel of an concrete civil juristic relation ” or … “the manifestation of will occurred for the realization of juristic effects materialized in the creation, the change, the transfer or the canceling of an concrete civil juristic relation ” (Art. 1166 C. civ.). The contract was defined 1 in the doctrine as the agreement of a will between two or more persons for the purpose of producing juristic effects, in other words giving birth, changing, transferring or canceling juristic relations. The contract is the main form of the juristic act, and the new civil code made the classification from more points of view (art. 1171 - 1177) in synallagmatic and <b>unilateral</b> <b>contracts,</b> contracts with onerous title and contracts with costless title, contracts with immediate or successive fulfillment, named or no-named contracts, consensual, solemn and real contracts, etc...|$|R
50|$|An {{offer to}} {{contract}} {{must be addressed}} to a person, be sufficiently definite - that is, describe the goods, quantity, and price - and indicate an intention for the offeror to be bound on acceptance. The CISG {{does not appear to}} recognise common law <b>unilateral</b> <b>contracts</b> but, subject to clear indication by the offeror, treats any proposal not addressed to a specific person as only an invitation to make an offer. Further, where there is no explicit price or procedure to implicitly determine price, then the parties are assumed to have agreed upon a price based upon that ‘generally charged {{at the time of the}} conclusion of the contract for such goods sold under comparable circumstances’.|$|R
5000|$|In {{common law}} jurisdictions, it {{is roughly the}} {{equivalent}} of a bilateral contract and may be contrasted with a gift (as such a relationship is not one of contract) or a <b>unilateral</b> <b>contract</b> in which only one party makes an enforceable promise.|$|E
50|$|A {{capitulation}} (from Lat. caput) is {{a treaty}} or <b>unilateral</b> <b>contract</b> {{by which a}} sovereign state relinquishes jurisdiction within its borders over the subjects of a foreign state. As a result, the foreign subjects are immune, for most civil and criminal purposes, from actions by courts and other governmental institutions in the state that makes the capitulation.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>unilateral</b> <b>contract</b> {{is created}} when someone offers to do {{something}} [...] "in return for" [...] {{the performance of the}} act stipulated in the offer.

Nonetheless, the person performing the act must do it in reliance on the offer.|$|E

5000|$|An {{exception}} {{exists in}} the case of <b>unilateral</b> <b>contracts,</b> in which the offeror makes an offer to the world which can be accepted by some act. A classic instance of this is the case of Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co. 1893 2 Q.B. 484 in which an offer was made to pay £100 to anyone who having bought the offeror's product and used it in accordance with the instructions nonetheless contracted influenza. The plaintiff who was Mrs Carlill bought the smoke ball and used it according to the instructions but she contracted influenza.She sued the Carbolic Smoke Ball Co. for £100.The court held that the inconvenience she went through by performing the act amounted to acceptance and therefore ordered £100 to be given to Mrs.Carlill. Her actions accepted the offer - {{there was no need to}} communicate acceptance. Typical cases of unilateral offers are advertisements of rewards (e.g., for the return of a lost dog).|$|R
50|$|But {{if there}} is clear intent to be contractually bound, the {{presumption}} is rebutted. In Merritt v Merritt 1970, a separation agreement between estranged spouses was enforceable.

In Errington v Errington 1952, a father's promise to his son and daughter-in-law that they could live in (and ultimately own) a house if they paid off {{the balance of the}} mortgage, was an enforceable <b>unilateral</b> <b>contract.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{unanimous}} opinion by Justice Harlan noted two {{issues in the}} case. First, since the relevant provisions of the FPA are substantially equivalent {{to those of the}} NGA, the Court held that, under the holding of Mobile Gas, the filing of a new rate schedule and the proceeding to review it was not effective to supersede the contract rate. Mobile Gas held that the NGA did not authorize a <b>unilateral</b> <b>contract</b> change, and that holding also applied to the FPA.|$|E
50|$|The {{criteria}} for novation comprise the obligee's {{acceptance of the}} new obligor, the new obligor's acceptance of the liability, and the old obligor's acceptance of the new contract as full performance of the old contract. Novation is not a <b>unilateral</b> <b>contract</b> mechanism, hence allows room for negotiation on the new T&Cs under the new circumstances. Thus, 'acceptance of the new contract as full performance of the old contract' may be read in conjunction to the phenomenon of 'mutual agreement of the T&Cs.|$|E

40|$|Chapter one. At present {{fundamental}} changes {{are evident in}} the law relating to self imposed obligations and these have been commented upon by both judges and writers. Chapter two Estoppel was known in equity from its very earliest days and included elements of the substantive part performance of expectations. Chapter three The early avoidance of the Statute of Frauds by equity was never based upon a single coherent principle but included elements of estoppel. Chapter four With the ascendency of classical common law contract in the nineteenth century, estoppel and the doctrine of part performance parted company and fulfilled separate roles. Chapter five With the revival of equitable principles and the disintegration of classical contract theory in the mid years of the present century the two doctrines have again moved together and there is a renewed prospect of part performance being enveloped by estoppel. Chapter six Conceptually there is, once again, little distinction between estoppel and part performance and they may both be used as vehicles to impose obligations over a wide spectrum. Chapter seven Apart from the 'doctrine of part performance' acts carried out in reliance upon an expectation may be rendered effective by other legal concepts such as <b>unilateral</b> <b>contracts.</b> Contracts may be imposed by the courts. Chapter eight There are indications that an emerging jurisdiction in reliance protection could cut away much of the territory presently occupied by estoppel and the doctrine of part performance. Chapter nine Should classical contract theory and estoppel remain as clearly distinct heads of law the future of the doctrine of part performance as a distinct legal concept seems assured. But should contract and estoppel merge into a unified regime of law relating to self imposed obligations the future of the doctrine of part performance could be precarious. Chapter ten So long as the Statute of Frauds survives a 'doctrine of part performance' in some form or other, will probably survive to afford the courts with a discretion as to when to avoid the Statute. But the Statute itself will probably not be permitted to determine the cbligations of the parties. Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|R
