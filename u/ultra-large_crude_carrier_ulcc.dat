50|$|In 1979, {{the company}} famously built the Seawise Giant, an Ultra Large <b>Crude</b> <b>Carrier</b> (<b>ULCC)</b> supertanker; the longest ship ever built.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to their}} {{favorable}} size, Aframax tankers can serve most ports in the world. These vessels serve regions {{that do not}} have very large ports or offshore oil terminals to accommodate very large <b>crude</b> <b>carriers</b> and <b>ultra-large</b> <b>crude</b> <b>carriers.</b> Aframax tankers are optimal for short- to medium-haul crude oil transportation. Aframax class tankers are largely used in the basins of the Black Sea, the North Sea, the Caribbean Sea, the South and East China Seas, and the Mediterranean. Non-OPEC exporting countries may require the use of tankers because the harbors and canals through which these countries export their oil are too small to accommodate the larger Suezmax or the larger still very large <b>crude</b> <b>carriers</b> and <b>ultra-large</b> <b>crude</b> <b>carriers.</b>|$|R
5|$|During the 1960s, {{developments}} {{in the pattern of}} oil transportation indicated that it would soon become most economical to move oil between the Middle East and Europe using ultra large <b>crude</b> <b>carrier</b> (<b>ULCC)</b> vessels. These vessels were so large {{that they would not be}} able to enter most of the older ports on the Atlantic Ocean, North Sea, and English Channel coasts.|$|R
50|$|Both tankers were {{constructed}} in Nagasaki, Japan by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd, work beginning on the Venoil in October 1972 and the Venpet in January 1973. The vessels were completed in March and June 1973 respectively {{at the cost}} of approximately $28m each. Each vessel was more than 330,000 deadweight (DWT) which, at the time, classified them as Very Large <b>Crude</b> <b>Carriers</b> (VLCCs). The current classification for vessels over 300,000 DWT is Ultra Large <b>Crude</b> <b>Carriers</b> (<b>ULCC).</b>|$|R
500|$|Oil tankers {{are often}} {{classified}} by their size {{as well as}} their occupation. The size classes range from inland or coastal tankers of a few thousand metric tons of deadweight (DWT) to the mammoth ultra large <b>crude</b> <b>carriers</b> (<b>ULCCs)</b> of [...] Tankers move approximately [...] of oil every year. Second only to pipelines in terms of efficiency, the average cost of oil transport by tanker amounts to only two or three United States cents per [...]|$|R
5000|$|The TI {{class of}} supertankers are {{currently}} the four largest {{ships in the}} world (by displacement, deadweight tonnage ≈ cargo mass, and gross tonnage, a formula value based on internal volume, not mass). The class comprises the ships TI Africa, TI Asia, TI Europe and TI Oceania, where the [...] "TI" [...] refers to the VLCC Tanker Pool operator Tankers International L.L.C.

5|$|Gulf {{was at the}} {{forefront}} of various projects in the late 1960s intended to adjust the world oil industry to developments of the time including closure of the Suez Canal after the 1967 war. In particular, Gulf undertook the construction of deep water terminals at Bantry Bay in Ireland and Okinawa in Japan capable of handling Ultra Large <b>Crude</b> <b>Carrier</b> (<b>ULCC)</b> vessels serving the European and Asian markets respectively. In 1968, the Universe Ireland was added to Gulf's tanker fleet. At , this was the largest vessel in the world and incapable of berthing at most normal ports.|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of PIPC {{is located at}} Pengerang, Kota Tinggi District, Johor, Malaysia which is a strategic location at the south-east tip of Peninsular Malaysia. It offers access to existing major international shipping lanes connecting Middle East-Singapore and China. It has excellent road networks to Singapore and other major ports in the Peninsula. Its safe and sheltered harbour with a natural water depth of 24m provides perfect berthing conditions for Ultra Large <b>Crude</b> <b>Carriers</b> (<b>ULCCs)</b> and Very Large <b>Crude</b> <b>Carriers</b> (VLCCs). No breakwater is required with sufficient seagoing passage for ULCCs and VLCCs. Pengerang also offers availability of sufficient development land with low negative socioeconomic impact and very few Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESAs) which are easily preserved.|$|R
50|$|Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. (OSG) is {{a tanker}} company engaged {{primarily}} in the ocean transportation of crude oil and petroleum products.
