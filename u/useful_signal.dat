25|$|Hydrogen is {{the most}} {{frequently}} imaged nucleus in MRI because it is present in biological tissues in great abundance, and because its high gyromagnetic ratio gives a strong signal. However, any nucleus with a net nuclear spin could potentially be imaged with MRI. Such nuclei include helium-3, lithium-7, carbon-13, fluorine-19, oxygen-17, sodium-23, phosphorus-31 and xenon-129. 23Na and 31P are naturally abundant in the body, so can be imaged directly. Gaseous isotopes such as 3He or 129Xe must be hyperpolarized and then inhaled as their nuclear density is too low to yield a <b>useful</b> <b>signal</b> under normal conditions. 17O and 19F can be administered in sufficient quantities in liquid form (e.g. 17O-water) that hyperpolarization is not a necessity.

Principal investigators at Stanford University reported on May 4, 2011, that they had accurately measured the frame dragging effect relative to the distant star IM Pegasi, and the calculations proved to be {{in line with the}} prediction of Einstein's theory. The results, published in Physical Review Letters measured the geodetic effect with an error of about 0.2 percent. The results reported the frame dragging effect (caused by Earth's rotation) added up to 37 milliarcseconds with an error of about 19 percent.

2500|$|Fourier-transform ion {{cyclotron}} resonance mass spectrometry {{is a type of}} mass analyzer (or mass spectrometer) for determining the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of ions based on the cyclotron frequency of the ions in a fixed magnetic field. The ions are trapped in a Penning trap (a magnetic field with electric trapping plates), where they are excited (at their resonant cyclotron frequencies) to a larger cyclotron radius by an oscillating electric field orthogonal to the magnetic field. After the excitation field is removed, the ions are rotating at their cyclotron frequency in phase (as a [...] "packet" [...] of ions). These ions induce a charge (detected as an image current) on a pair of electrodes as the packets of ions pass close to them. The resulting signal is called a free induction decay (FID), transient or interferogram that consists of a superposition of sine waves. The <b>useful</b> <b>signal</b> is extracted from this data by performing a Fourier transform to give a mass spectrum.|$|E

40|$|The article {{describes}} and analyzes mathematical models of multiplicative and additive non-Gaussian noises affecting the <b>useful</b> <b>signals.</b> For synthesis and analysis, and, hence, the {{effective design of}} information systems and radio devices operating in conditions of intense perturbations {{it is necessary to}} choose not only the adequate mathematical model of the <b>useful</b> <b>signals</b> and information processes, but also the corresponding models of random effects, possessing in general non-Gaussian multiplicative and additive character. To describe the arbitrary non-Gaussian noises, which are quasiharmonic processes whose spectrum is close (or narrowband) to the band of the desired signal, the authors used a two-dimensional elliptic symmetric probability density function, including two extreme cases: Gaussian processes and a sinusoidal signal with random initial phase distributed uniformly in the interval [0, 2 π]. Model of correlated non-Gaussian narrowband noises of elliptically symmetric two-dimensional probability density function allows you to make a synthesis of information systems and devices based only on a priori knowledge of one-dimensional probability density function and the correlation function.
