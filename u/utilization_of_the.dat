5|$|To {{experience}} {{firsthand the}} processes mod-makers {{would have to}} go through with the new engine, Valve ported Half-Life (dubbed Half-Life: Source) and Counter-Strike to their new Source engine. Half-Life: Source is a straight port, lacking any new content or the Blue Shift High Definition pack. However, it does take advantage of vertex and pixel shaders for more realistic water effects, as well as Half-Life 2's realistic physics engine. They also added several other features from Half-Life 2, including improved dynamic lightmaps, vertex maps, ragdolls, and a shadowmap system with cleaner, higher resolution, specular texture and normal maps, as well as <b>utilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> render-to-texture soft shadows found in Half-Life 2s Source engine, along with 3D skybox replacements in place of the old 16-bit color prerendered bitmap skies. The Half-Life port possesses many of the Source engine's graphical strengths as well as control weaknesses that have been noted in the Source engine. Later updates added a field of view options, support for OS X and Linux, an optional high-definition texture pack, among other improvements. Half-Life: Source is available with special editions of Half-Life 2, or separately on Steam.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} <b>the</b> perioperative prophylactic <b>utilization</b> <b>of</b> antibiotics in phacoemulsification and {{intraocular lens}} implantation patients in ophthalmology department of our hospital. METHODS: A total of 1 156 cases underwent phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation from November, 2009 to November, 2012 in our hospital was included. Category of antibiotics, administration time point, medication time, wound healing were analyzed statistically and <b>the</b> rationality <b>of</b> above indexes was evaluated. RESULTS: All 1 156 cases received prophylactic antimicrobials by local application in the perioperative period(100 %). <b>The</b> <b>utilization</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> antibacterials systematically <b>of</b> 1 156 patients was 166 (14. 36 %); <b>The</b> <b>utilization</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> antibacterials systematically {{in patients with}} two systemic infection risk factors was 72. 09 %; <b>The</b> <b>utilization</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> antibacterials systematically in patients with three or more systemic infection risk factors was 100 %.
