500|$|The sixth {{season of}} The Real Housewives of Atlanta {{received}} generally favorable reviews from contemporary critics.

[...] However, Jodi Walker from Entertainment Weekly later criticized the series for insisting its disapproval of violence, despite its widespread promotion of the fight between Williams and Moore and ultimate decision to broadcast the altercation. In April 2014, Bravo renewed The Real Housewives of Atlanta for a seventh season, and additionally announced the spin-off series The Real Housewives of Atlanta: Kandi's Wedding.|$|E

500|$|Late at night, while {{investigating}} an orchard, Mulder is sprayed by a crop-dusting {{helicopter and}} ends <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital.</b> There, Mulder sees the message [...] "Do It Now" [...] on a TV and realizes {{that when people}} {{are exposed to the}} pesticide, which contains a chemical called LSDM designed to provoke fear in insects, they see these subliminal messages, and their phobias are exacerbated enough to cause them to kill. Eventually, after being confronted, the city councilman agrees to stop the spraying and blood test the community under the guise of a cholesterol study. Mulder and Scully, reading that Funsch has not been tested yet, arrive at his house to find it strewn with smashed electronic devices. Mulder deduces that blood is Ed's phobia and that he has seen the subliminal messages, and an empty rifle case signals that Funsch is going to act on his paranoia. Funsch positions himself {{at the top of a}} clock tower overlooking a blood drive and begins shooting randomly. Mulder climbs up to Funsch and overpowers him; Funsch is taken away on a stretcher. Mulder makes a call to Scully and sees the message [...] "All done. Bye Bye" [...] on his cell phone display. Scully calls out to Mulder but he is speechless.|$|E
500|$|In {{the episodes}} prior to [...] "Beyond the Sea", the protagonists of The X-Files are firmly {{established}} in the roles of believer (Mulder) and rational scientist/skeptic (Scully). [...] "Beyond the Sea" [...] is the first episode in which these roles are reversed. Scully, vulnerable {{after the death of}} her father, is persuaded by Boggs' apparent psychic ability. Meanwhile, Mulder refuses to believe the serial killer, discounts any evidence in Boggs' favor and will only consider rational explanations. According to Jan Delsara, Scully is inclined to believe Boggs because she identifies with him: they both understand the pressure of high family expectations. Scully strongly desired to make her father proud, despite not fulfilling his expectation that she became a doctor, and Boggs, in killing his family, had hoped to kill their expectations and judgment of him. In contrast, Mulder's relationship with his parents, based on resentment of them for their failure to protect his sister (themes developed later in the series), makes him unwilling to identify with Boggs. While Scully follows her instinct and solves the case, Mulder gets shot and ends <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> because of his doubts and skepticism. According to Joe Bellon, as the episode progresses, even Scully's personality becomes like Mulder's and [...] "for all narrative purposes, she becames Mulder for almost an entire episode." [...] According to Dean A. Kowalski, this role reversal of the partners represents a [...] "blending" [...] of Mulder and Scully's characters that is present throughout the series.|$|E
500|$|The film's {{ethereal}} aspects {{and double}} exposures were {{performed in the}} camera because {{the ability to create}} the effects in lab did not yet exist. Dwan made 24 dissolves in the film, each required precise control by the cameramen and that the counts had to be exact otherwise the shot would be ruined. Lombardi notes that the cinematographer, Walter Pritchard, was the man who had to go through the ordeal and that Universal said {{he was one of the}} company's oldest men. Dwan would claim that Pritchard would end <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> from the production. In The Parade's Gone By, Brownlow instead gives the number of dissolves as 25 and adds to the story by Dwan claiming that the audience could not figure out the effect was done. Dwan also claimed that by the time 15 dissolves were done that the cinematographer was so nervous that the it would keep him up at night and cause his hands to shake so greatly that an assistant would have to reload the film at the right spot before shots. This production may have been the last unbilled movie credit of Lon Chaney. The discovery of Lon Chaney's role was through Chaney having marked his appearance in a still with an X above his head. Chaney wrote [...] "This is me just below the X sign. Here I am a Russian Prince." [...] on the back of the still. The image still in particular leaves no question that it comes from The Restless Spirit because it also appears on the cover of The Universal Weekly for October 23, 1913. The second image found on the estate depicts Lon Chaney in the role of a wildman, which Mirsalis attributes to a fantasy sequence in the film.|$|E
