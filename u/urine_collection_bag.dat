40|$|Background: A {{urinary tract}} {{infection}} (UTI) is a common bacterial infection in children. UTIs {{may be difficult to}} recognize in young children, because the presenting symptoms are non-specific. However, it is important to diagnose and treat children with a UTI as soon as possible. Several methods are used for urine collection in diaper-wearing children. A bladder catheterization and suprapubic aspiration give most reliable results, but are invasive. A <b>urine</b> <b>collection</b> <b>bag</b> is often distressing, leaking and leaving red marks and the collection pads now available still need many actions before urine can be analyzed. According to current guidelines a urine sample collected by a collection bag is only used to rule out UTI. If the analysis of urine obtained by a collection bag is positive, a urine sample obtained by catheterization is necessary to rule out or prove UTI. Recently a new type of collection pad has been developed, the PeeSpot®. This is a felt of 30 x 10 x 5 mm which can absorb 1. 2 ml urine and can be placed in the diaper, but has only been validated for biochemical analyses up to now. Aim: To examine if the PeeSpot®, being a fast, child-friendly method, {{can be used as a}} reliable alternative for the <b>urine</b> <b>collection</b> <b>bag</b> to rule out UTI in diaper-wearing children. Setting: Children’s department of Deventer Hospital, a non-academic teaching hospital, in The Netherlands. Methods: This study consists of 3 sub-studies. 1) In a laboratory study the number of bacteria of 15 urine samples of adults was counted before and after absorption by the PeeSpot® felts. 2) In a clinical study urine samples of diaper-wearing children, with and without UTI, were obtained with the PeeSpot® felts. These samples were analyzed by counting the number of bacteria with the sediMAX analyzer (a new automated sediment analyzer) and by a urinary culture and contamination rate is calculated. 3) To compare that contamination rate to other methods of urine collection we did a retrospective study. In this sub-study all urine samples of children 0 - 42 months old obtained in our hospital in 2012 were evaluated and with their urinary culture results contamination rates are calculated for urine collected by collection bag and catheterization. Results: 1) The laboratory study shows that bacteria are fully recovered from the PeeSpot® felt. 2) The clinical study gives a contamination rate of 94 % for the PeeSpot®. There is no significant difference found between the two sexes, age on collection date, time span the felts stayed in the diaper and the four different wards where samples were obtained and number of bacteria counted or urinary culture results. 3) The retrospective study shows that contamination rate for catheterization is 0 - 44 % and for a <b>urine</b> <b>collection</b> <b>bag</b> 80 - 87 %. The difference between the contamination rate of the PeeSpot® and the collection bag turns out not to be significant in this study. Conclusion: We found that urine samples obtained with the PeeSpot® give a high contamination rate, but comparable to the contamination rate of a <b>urine</b> <b>collection</b> <b>bag.</b> Under certain conditions the PeeSpot® could be an alternative, more child-friendly method for the collection bag to rule out UTI, but further research is necessary with more urine samples of children with proven UTI. ...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} current practices amongst general practitioners in the West of Ireland with regard to the investigation, diagnosis and management of urinary tract infection (UTI) in children and to evaluate these practices against recently published guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). METHODS: A postal survey was performed using a questionnaire that included short clinical scenarios. All general practices in a single health region were sent a questionnaire, cover letter and SAE. Systematic postal and telephone contact was made with non-responders. The data was analysed using SPSS version 15. RESULTS: Sixty-nine general practitioners were included in the study and 50 (72 %) responded to the questionnaire. All respondents agreed that it is important to consider diagnosis of UTI in all children with unexplained fever. Doctors accurately identified relevant risk factors for UTI in the majority (87 %) of cases. In collecting urine samples from a one year old child, 80 % of respondents recommended the use of a <b>urine</b> <b>collection</b> <b>bag</b> and the remaining 20 % recommended collection of a clean catch sample. Respondents differed greatly in their practice with regard to detailed investigation and specialist referral after a first episode of UTI. Co-amoxiclav was the most frequently used antibiotic for the treatment of cystitis, with most doctors prescribing a five day course. CONCLUSIONS: In general, this study reveals a high level of clinical knowledge amongst doctors treating children with UTI in primary care in the catchment area of County Mayo. However, it also demonstrates wide variation in practice with regard to detailed investigation and specialist referral. The common practice of prescribing long courses of antibiotics when treating lower urinary tract infection is at variance with NICE's recommendation of a three day course of antibiotics for cystitis in children over three months of age when there are no atypical features...|$|E
40|$|The enterococcal surface protein, Esp, is a high-molecular-weight surface protein {{of unknown}} {{function}} whose frequency is significantly increased among infection-derived Enterococcus faecalis isolates. In this work, a global structural similarity {{was found between}} Bap, a biofilm-associated protein of Staphylococcus aureus, and Esp. Analysis {{of the relationship between}} the presence of the Esp-encoding gene (esp) and the biofilm formation capacity in E. faecalis demonstrated that the presence of the esp gene is highly associated (P < 0. 0001) with the capacity of E. faecalis to form a biofilm on a polystyrene surface, since 93. 5 % of the E. faecalis esp-positive isolates were capable of forming a biofilm. Moreover, none of the E. faecalis esp-deficient isolates were biofilm producers. Depending on the E. faecalis isolate, insertional mutagenesis of esp caused either a complete loss of the biofilm formation phenotype or no apparent phenotypic defect. Complementation studies revealed that Esp expression in an E. faecalis esp-deficient strain promoted primary attachment and biofilm formation on polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride plastic from <b>urine</b> <b>collection</b> <b>bags.</b> Together, these results demonstrate that (i) biofilm formation capacity is widespread among clinical E. faecalis isolates, (ii) the biofilm formation capacity is restricted to the E. faecalis strains harboring esp, and (iii) Esp promotes primary attachment and biofilm formation of E. faecalis on abiotic surfaces...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES To {{test the}} ability of a sensor {{developed}} to signal infection by the organisms that generate the crystalline biofilms that encrust catheters, to give an early warning that encrustation was occurring on patients' catheters, as the care of many patients undergoing long-term bladder catheterization is complicated by the encrustation and blockage of their catheters PATIENTS AND METHODS Twenty patients were followed prospectively for the lifetime of one of their catheters. Sensors based on cellulose acetate/bromothymol blue were placed in the urine-collection bags, which were changed as usual at weekly intervals. The bacteriology was assessed and pH determined weekly on urine samples. Photographic records were made of the sensors twice weekly. On removal, each catheter was examined for encrustation and blockage. RESULTS Proteus mirabilis was not isolated from five patients and in these cases the sensor colour remained golden-yellow to brown. The catheters drained for the scheduled period and showed no signs of encrustation. By contrast, the sensors turned dark blue/black in the urine of all 15 patients infected with P. mirabilis. All these patients' catheters were encrusted and in 12 the catheters blocked. The mean interval between the sensor signalling and the catheter blocking was 12 days. CONCLUSION The cellulose acetate/bromothymol blue sensors placed in the <b>urine</b> <b>collection</b> <b>bags</b> are capable of signalling infection by P. mirabilis. They also signal the early stages of catheter encrustation and allow catheter replacement in ample time to avoid the clinical crises and emergency referrals caused by catheter blockage...|$|R

40|$|Intestinal barrier {{function}} in pigs after weaning is almost exclusively determined in terminal experiments with Ussing chambers. Alternatively, the recovery in urine of orally administered lactulose {{can be used}} to assess intestinal permeability in living animals. This experiment was designed to study the {{barrier function}} of the small intestine of pigs over time after weaning. The aim was to relate paracellular barrier function (measured by lactulose recovery in the urine) with macromolecular transport [measured by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) using Ussing chambers] and bacterial translocation to assess whether lactulose recovery is related to possible causes of infection and disease. Forty gonadectomized male pigs (6. 7 ± 0. 6 kg) were weaned (d 0) at a mean age of 19 d, fitted with <b>urine</b> <b>collection</b> <b>bags,</b> and individually housed. Pigs were dosed by oral gavage with a marker solution containing lactulose (disaccharide) and the monosaccharides l-rhamnose, 3 -O-methylglucose, and d-xylose at 2 h and at 4, 8, and 12 d after weaning. The recovery of sugars in the urine was determined over 18 h after each oral gavage. The day after each permeability test, the intestines of 10 pigs were dissected to determine bacterial translocation to the mesenteric lymph nodes and jejunal permeability for HRP in Ussing chambers. Recovery of l-rhamnose in urine was affected by feed intake and by the time after weaning (P = 0. 05). Recovery of lactulose from the urine was greater (P = 0. 05) at 4, 8, and 12 d after weaning compared with the first day after weaning and was negatively correlated with feed intake (r = - 0. 63, P = 0. 001). The mean translocation of aerobic bacteria to the mesenteric lymph nodes was greater at 5 and 13 d after weaning compared with d 1 (P = 0. 05). Lactulose recovery showed no correlation with permeability for HRP nor with bacterial translocation (P > 0. 05). Although both lactulose recovery and bacterial translocation increased over time after weaning, lactulose recovery did not correlate with the permeability for HRP nor bacterial translocation within a pig (P > 0. 05). Therefore, we conclude that lactulose recovery in the urine of pigs after weaning is not associated with risk factors for infections. However, it appears to be possible to measure paracellular barrier function with orally administered lactulose in pigs shortly after weaning. Further studies will reveal whether this variable is relevant for the long-term performance or health of pigs after weanin...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION Clean urine {{samples are}} {{necessary}} to accurately diagnose several diseases in new-borns, especially Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs). A wide range of clinical interventions for <b>urine</b> <b>collection</b> is described in the literature including non-invasive and invasive methods. The most common non-invasive technique is <b>urine</b> <b>collection</b> using sterile <b>bags,</b> which is associated with significant patient discomfort and contamination of samples. Obtaining a clean-catch urine sample is the recommended method for <b>urine</b> <b>collection</b> in children able to co-operate. However, in children lacking sphincter control, urine catch is more difficult and time-consuming and invasive methods (catheterization and needle aspiration of urine from the bladder) are sometimes needed. There are some stimulation techniques that facilitate emptying of the bladder in situations of bladder dysfunction. We hypothesized {{that the use of}} such methods in new-borns could facilitate the collection of a clean-catch urine sample. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the success rate and safety of a new non-invasive technique to obtain clean-catch urine samples in newborns. AIM To describe and test a new technique to obtain midstream urine samples in newborns. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a prospective, feasible and safety study conducted in Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital, Warangal, (A secondary centre with a 20 -bed neonatal unit, a 130 -beded pediatric ward).

30|$|There {{are also}} some {{important}} and obvious limitations to our study. First of all, there is the retrospective design leading to missing data on antibiotic use and other infectious foci, among other problems. Secondly, our patient population evolved significantly over the 8 -year time period. Disease severity (SAPS-II score), ICU length of stay, number of ventilation days, and ICU mortality increased significantly over the four time periods. To correct for this evolution, crude UTI rates were adjusted for disease severity, but naturally, this does not correct for all possible sources of bias in the study. Third, potential etiological factors {{for the development of}} IBP monitoring-associated UTI were not considered. The duration of urinary catheterization could be different in the four groups, although this was determined by the standard ICU procedures as stated in the methods (<b>urine</b> drainage tubing, <b>collection</b> <b>bags,</b> and FoleyManometers were replaced every 7 days). Fourth, due to the epidemiologic and observational nature of the study looking at global incidences, we could not look for individual factors predictive for UTI or outcome by multiple logistic regression analysis.|$|R
40|$|OBJETIVE: to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of urine culture by bag specimen {{for the detection of}} neonatal urinary tract infection in full-term newborn infants. Retrospective study (1997) including full-term newborn infants having a positive urine culture (> 100, 000 CFU/ml) by <b>bag</b> specimen <b>collection.</b> The urinary tract infection diagnosis was confirmed by positive urine culture (suprapubic bladder aspiration method). The select cases were divided into three groups, according to newborn infant age at the bag specimen collection: GI ( 7 d, n = 9). Sixty one full-term newborn infants were studied (5. 1 % of total infants). The diagnosis was confirmed on 19 / 61 (31. 1 %) of full-term infants born alive. Distribution among the groups was: GI = 2 / 17 (11. 8 %), GII = 10 // 35 (28. 6 %), and GIII = 7 / 9 (77. 7 %). The most relevant clinical symptoms were: fever (GI - 100 %, GII - 91. 4 %) and weight loss (GI - 35. 3 %, GII - 45. 7 %). Urine culture results for specimens collected by suprapubic aspiration were: E. coli GI (100 %), GII (40 %) and GIII (28. 6 %), E. faecalis GI (30 %), Staphylococcus coagulase-negative GII (20 %) and GIII (42. 8 %), and Staphylococcus aureus GII (10 %). Correlation between positive <b>urine</b> culture <b>collection</b> (<b>bag</b> specimen method) and urinary tract infection diagnosis, using relative risk analysis, produced the following results: GI= 0. 30 (CI 95 % 0. 08 - 1. 15), GII= 0. 51 (CI 95 % 0. 25 - 1. 06) and GIII= 3. 31 (CI 95 % 1. 8 - 6. 06) The most frequent urinary tract infection clinical signs in the first week were fever and weight loss, while non-specific symptomatology occurred later.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: While urine {{sampling}} {{is necessary}} in the diagnosis of urinary tract infection and electrolyte disturbances, the <b>collection</b> of <b>urine</b> in neonates and non-toilet-trained children is often difficult. A universal <b>urine</b> <b>collection</b> method providing representative urinalyses results is needed. The objective {{of this study is}} to evaluate the applicability of the currently used <b>urine</b> <b>collection</b> pads (gauze compresses) and a new <b>urine</b> <b>collection</b> device (Peespot). DESIGN AND METHODS: We tested the reliability of routine (semi-) quantitative urinalysis results with these two different kinds of <b>urine</b> <b>collection</b> methods in a laboratory model. Although important in clinical diagnosis, we did not evaluate the effects on cellular and other components such as casts in the urinary sediment. RESULTS: Most semi-quantitative variables determined by urine stick (pH, blood, protein, leukocytes, nitrite, glucose, ketones, bilirubin and urobilinogen) gave concordant results for both methods compared with native urine. Using the Peespot <b>urine</b> <b>collection</b> device, reliable quantitative results were obtained for calcium, chloride, glucose, magnesium, phosphate, potassium, sodium, osmolality, urea nitrogen and urate compared with native urine. Data were concordant only for chloride, phosphate, glucose, sodium and urea nitrogen by use of gauze compresses. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Urine</b> <b>collection</b> pads are non-invasive methods useful in the <b>collection</b> of <b>urine</b> in non-toilet-trained children.

40|$|Background. Urinary tract {{infection}} (UTI) in the United States is {{the most}} common bacterial infection, and urine cultures often make up the largest portion of workload for a hospital-based microbiology laboratory. Appropriately managing the factors affecting the preanalytic phase of urine culture contributes significantly to the generation of meaningful culture results that ultimately affect patient diagnosis and management. Urine culture contamination can be reduced with proper techniques for <b>urine</b> <b>collection,</b> preservation, storage, and transport, the major factors affecting the preanalytic phase of urine culture. Objectives. The purposes of this review were to identify and evaluate preanalytic practices associated with urine specimens and to assess their impact on the accuracy of urine culture microbiology. Specific practices included collection methods for men, women, and children; preservation of urine samples in boric acid solutions; and the effect of refrigeration on stored urine. Practice efficacy and effectiveness were measured by two parameters: reduction of urine culture contamination and increased accuracy of patient diagnosis. The CDC Laboratory Medicine Best Practices (LMBP) initiative's systematic review method for assessment of quality improvement (QI) practices was employed. Results were then translated into evidence-based practice guidelines. Search strategy. A search of three electronic bibliographic databases (PubMed, SCOPUS, and CINAHL), as well as hand searching of bibliographies from relevant information sources, for English-language articles published between 1965 and 2014 was conducted. Selection criteria. The search contained the following medical subject headings and key text words: urinary tract infections, UTI, urine/analysis, urine/microbiology, urinalysis, specimen handling, preservation, biological, preservation, boric acid, boric acid/borate, refrigeration, storage, time factors, transportation, transport time, time delay, time factor, timing, <b>urine</b> specimen <b>collection,</b> catheters, indwelling, urinary reservoirs, continent, urinary catheterization, intermittent urethral catheterization, clean voided, midstream, Foley, suprapubic, bacteriological techniques, and microbiological techniques. Main results. Both boric acid and refrigeration adequately preserved urine specimens prior to their processing for up to 24 h. Urine held at room temperature for more than 4 h showed overgrowth of both clinically significant and contaminating microorganisms. The overall strength of this body of evidence, however, was rated as low. For urine specimens collected from women, {{there was no difference in}} rates of contamination for midstream urine specimens collected with or without cleansing. The overall strength of this evidence was rated as high. The levels of diagnostic accuracy of midstream <b>urine</b> <b>collection</b> with or without cleansing were similar, although the overall strength of this evidence was rated as low. For urine specimens collected from men, there was a reduction in contamination in favor of midstream clean-catch over first-void specimen collection. The strength of this evidence was rated as high. Only one study compared midstream collection with cleansing to midstream collection without cleansing. Results showed no difference in contamination between the two methods of collection. However, imprecision was due largely to the small event size. The diagnostic accuracy of midstream <b>urine</b> <b>collection</b> from men compared to straight catheterization or suprapubic aspiration was high. However, the overall strength of this body of evidence was rated as low. For urine specimens collected from children and infants, the evidence comparing contamination rates for midstream <b>urine</b> <b>collection</b> with cleansing, midstream collection without cleansing, sterile <b>urine</b> <b>bag</b> <b>collection,</b> and diaper collection pointed to larger reductions in the odds of contamination in favor of midstream collection with cleansing over the other methods of collection. This body of evidence was rated as high. The accuracy of diagnosis of urinary tract infection from midstream clean-catch urine specimens, sterile urine bag specimens, or diaper specimens compared to straight catheterization or suprapubic aspiration was varied. Authors' conclusions. No recommendation for or against is made for delayed processing of urine stored at room temperature, refrigerated, or preserved in boric acid. This does not preclude the use of refrigeration or chemical preservatives in clinical practice. It does indicate, however, that more systematic studies evaluating the utility of these measures are needed. If noninvasive collection is being considered for women, midstream collection with cleansing is recommended, but no recommendation for or against is made for midstream collection without cleansing. If noninvasive collection is being considered for men, midstream collection with cleansing is recommended and <b>collection</b> of first-void <b>urine</b> is not recommended. No recommendation for or against is made for <b>collection</b> of midstream <b>urine</b> without cleansing. If noninvasive collection is being considered for children, midstream collection with cleansing is recommended and <b>collection</b> in sterile <b>urine</b> <b>bags,</b> from diapers, or midstream without cleansing is not recommended. Whether midstream collection with cleansing can be routinely used in place of catheterization or suprapubic aspiration is unclear. The data suggest that midstream collection with cleansing is accurate for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections in infants and children and has higher average accuracy than sterile <b>urine</b> <b>bag</b> <b>collection</b> (data for diaper collection were lacking); however, the overall strength of evidence was low, as multivariate modeling could not be performed, and thus no recommendation for or against can be made. 2015 - 11 - 23 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 26598386 PMC 477121...|$|R

We found that reliability ofthe urine collec-tion could be monitored by simultaneous measurement of creatinine clearance. Method The 15 subjects were inpatients who had been admitted consecu...|$|R
40|$|The optimal {{evaluation}} of patients suspected ofhaving a pheochromocytoma remains con-troversial. The availability {{of large numbers}} of hormone assays and the need to exclude with certainty a potentially lethal disorder with an unpre-dictable course have led to various approaches to biochemical testing. The quantification of the urinary excretion rate of catecholamine and catecholamine metabolites has been the mainstay of the diagnosis of pheochromo-cytoma. The most useful urine tests are those that measure concentrations of metanephrines (normeta-nephrine and metanephrine combined), vanillylman-delic acid (VMA), and free (unconjugated) catechol-amines. The 24 -hour <b>urine</b> <b>collection</b> is the standard.

40|$|Summary: Conventional {{creatinine}} clearances involving <b>urine</b> <b>collections</b> over 2, 4 and 24 {{hours and}} creatinine clearance predicted from plasma creatinine concentrations without <b>urine</b> <b>collection</b> {{were compared to}} glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimated by 9 'Tc DTPA clearance in 171 patients {{with a wide range}} of GFR. AU creatinine clearance methods involving <b>urine</b> <b>collection</b> had standard errors of the estimate ofGFR greater than predictions from formulae. Predictions of creatinine clearance by formulae had coefficients of variation of the estimate of approximately 23 % when compared to isotopicaly determined GFR. Creatinine clearances determined by these equations in patients with stable renal function are an easier and at least as accurate a guide to GFR as methods involving urine colection...|$|R
40|$|Several medical {{conditions}} require {{the administration of}} intravenous (IV) fluids,but limitations of mass, volume, shelf-life, transportation, and local resources can restrict the availability of these important fluids. Such limitations are expected in long-duration space exploration missions and in remote or austere places on Earth. This design uses regular drinking water that is pumped through two filters to produce, in minutes, sterile, ultrapure water that meets the stringent quality standards of the United States Pharmacopeia for Water for Injection (Total Bacteria, Conductivity, Endo - toxins, Total Organic Carbon). The device weighs 2. 2 lb (1 kg) and is 10 in. long, 5 in. wide, and 3 in. high (25, 13, and 7. 5 cm, respectively) in its storage configuration. This handheld device produces one liter of medical-grade water in 21 minutes. Total production capacity for this innovation {{is expected to be}} in the hundreds of liters. The device contains one battery powered electric mini-pump. Alternatively, a manually powered pump can be attached and used. Drinking water enters the device from a source water bag, flows through two filters, and final sterile production water exits into a sealed, medical-grade <b>collection</b> <b>bag.</b> The <b>collection</b> <b>bag</b> contains pre-placed crystalline salts to mix with product water to form isotonic intravenous medical solutions. Alternatively, a hypertonic salt solution can be injected into a filled <b>bag.</b> The filled <b>collection</b> <b>bag</b> is detached from the device and is ready for use or storage. This device currently contains one <b>collection</b> <b>bag,</b> but a manifold of several pre-attached bags or replacement of single <b>collection</b> <b>bags</b> under sterile needle technique is possible for the production of multiple liters. The entire system will be flushed, sealed, and radiation-sterilized. Operation of the device is easy and requires minimal training. Drinking water is placed into the <b>collection</b> <b>bag.</b> Inline stopcock flow valves at the source and <b>collection</b> <b>bags</b> are opened, and the mini-pump is turned on by a switch to begin fluid flow. When the <b>collection</b> <b>bag</b> is completely filled with the medical- grade water, the pump can be turned off. The pump is designed so it cannot pump air, and overfilling of the <b>collection</b> <b>bag</b> with fluid is avoided by placing an equal amount of water in the source bag. Backflow is avoided by inline check valves. The filled <b>collection</b> <b>bag</b> is disconnected from its tubing and is ready for use. The source bag can be refilled for production of multiple liters, or the source bag can be replaced with an input tube that can be placed in a larger potable water source if the device is attended. The device functions in all orientations independent of any gravity fields. In addition to creating IV fluids, the device produces medical-grade water, which can be used for mixing with medications for injection, reconstituting freeze-dried blood products for injection, or for wound hydration or irrigation. Potential worldwide use is expected with medical activities in environments that have limited resources, storage, or resupply such as in military field operations, humanitarian relief efforts, submarines, commercial cruise ships, etc...|$|R

To investigate {{the strengths and}} limitations of methods used to assess completion of 24 -hour <b>urine</b> <b>collection,</b> the authors systematically reviewed {{the literature on the}} accuracy and usefulness of methods vs para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) recovery (referent). The percentage of incomplete collections, based on PABA, was 6 % to 47 % (n= 8 studies). The sensitivity and specificity for identifying incomplete collection using creatinine criteria (n= 4 studies) was 6 % to 63 % and 57 % to 99. 7 %, respectively. The most sensitive method for removing incomplete collections was a creatinine index < 0. 7. In pooled analysis (≥ 2 studies), mean urine creatinine excretion and volume were higher among participants with complete collection (P<. 05); whereas, self-reported collection time did not differ by completion status. Compared with participants with incomplete collection, mean 24 -hour sodium excretion was 19. 6  mmol higher (n= 1781 specimens, 5 studies) in patients with complete collection. Sodium excretion may be underestimated by inclusion of incomplete 24 -hour <b>urine</b> <b>collections.</b> None of the current approaches reliably assess completion of 24 -hour <b>urine</b> <b>collection...</b>|$|R
