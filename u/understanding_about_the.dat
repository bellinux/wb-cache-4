5|$|Both {{of these}} discoveries—the space {{weathering}} effects {{and the low}} density—led to a new <b>understanding</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> relationship between S-type asteroids and OC meteorites. S-types are the most numerous kind of asteroid in the inner part of the asteroid belt. OC meteorites are, likewise, {{the most common type}} of meteorite found on the Earth's surface. The reflection spectra measured by remote observations of S-type asteroids, however, did not match that of OC meteorites. The Galileo flyby of Ida found that some S-types, particularly the Koronis family, could be the source of these meteorites.|$|E

He said he hopes to help reduce the stigma of BPD, and encourage and lead others with the disorder to receive proper care.

25|$|The lack of {{an impact}} crater at the {{discovery}} site was only explained after the 1920's, with the new <b>understanding</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Missoula Floods, {{one of the largest}} floods documented, caused by the collapse of an ice barrier during the last deglaciation. The meteorite presumably landed on an ice cap in what is now Montana or western Canada, and was transported as a glacial erratic (dragged by the glacier ice) to the vicinity of an ice barrier that formed across the Clark Fork River. This barrier had ponded a huge amount of water at the Lake Missoula right at the time when the meteorite reached the area and the ice barrier became unstable and breached. The resulting flood involved up to 10 million cubic meters per second of water discharge, with large blocks of ice rafting down the Columbia River and the Willamette Valley {{at the end of the}} last Ice Age (~13,000 years ago). Some of these ice rafts included boulders (named erratics by geologists) like the Willamette meteorite, which eventually sunk in the flood waters and settled where they were found by humans.|$|E

2500|$|The book, {{which began}} as a {{doctoral}} dissertation, was written largely as an answer to Christopher Browning's 1992 publication on the Holocaust, Ordinary Men. Much of Goldhagen's book was concerned with the same Order Police Battalion 101 that Browning had studied, though with very different conclusions. Browning’s book recognizes {{the impact of the}} unending campaign of anti-Semitic propaganda, but takes other contributing factors into account as well such as: the fear of breaking ranks, career advancement, the concern of not being seen as weak, and the issue of the bureaucracy of a state apparatus. Likewise, Browning asserts that battlefield conditions and peer-bonding imparted their coercion on the behavior of the Germans. Goldhagen does not acknowledge these other variables for their overall influence on the volunteer police battalions and maintains that they acted exclusively of their own volition, motivated intrinsically by putative anti-Semitic eliminationism. These alleged shortfalls nothwithstanding, Goldhagen's book {{went on to win the}} American Political Science Association's 1994 Gabriel A.
