2500|$|His {{interest}} in physics {{led him to}} develop new ultrasound technologies for examining and treating the eye. [...] Together with William Konig and Louis Katz, he created the first commercially available B-scan ultrasound equipment. [...] His numerous patents include those for an ultrasonically vibrated surgical knife, an ultrasonic diagnostic and therapeutic transducer assembly (with methodology), a system of therapeutic ultrasound and real-time ultrasonic scanning, and an <b>ultrasound</b> <b>system</b> for corneal biometry. His pioneering surgical techniques include the first vitreo-retinal surgery in New York and, using the ultrasound that he developed, demonstrating that operating at an earlier stage in ocular trauma could vastly improve the patient's prognosis for recovery. He has specialized in vitreo-retinal surgery and has had a career-long {{interest in}} imaging research. With a generous gift from Charles and Margaret Dyson, He established the Margaret M. Dyson Vision Research Institute, {{one of the major}} retinal research programs in the world. [...] The Dyson Institute continues research on the causes and possible therapies for age related macular degeneration and ultrasound imaging of the retina and choroid.|$|E

40|$|Doppler <b>ultrasound</b> <b>systems</b> {{are widely}} used to study blood flow and {{diagnosis}} of vascular diseases. An important characteristic of these systems {{is the ability to}} detect the direction of the blood flow. Most Doppler <b>ultrasound</b> <b>systems</b> apply a quadrature demodulation technique on the ultrasonic transducer output signal. Therefore additional treatment is necessary to separate forward and reverse flow signals. This work presents a digital method to convert signals in quadrature into directional signals using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) approach. Validation of the method has been achieved using simulated Doppler ultrasound signals...|$|R

5000|$|PaPeRo uses {{different}} {{technologies to}} interact with its environment. For example, Its [...] "eyes" [...] are really twin cameras with a face recognition system. When PaPeRo has nothing to do, it roams around looking for faces. Upon finding one, it will try to start a conversation. PaPeRo also has a speech recognition system. With a pair of sensitive microphones, it can determine exactly where a sound comes from and if the sound is human speech. The robot will then interpret the information and respond accordingly. While PaPeRo roams around, it uses an <b>ultrasound</b> <b>system</b> located in its chest to detect objects. If an object lies in its path, PaPeRo's <b>ultrasound</b> <b>system</b> will detect where exactly the object is, and then PaPeRo will {{decide what to do}} to avoid the object.

5000|$|The ADR 2130, {{designed}} by Marty Wilcox {{was the first}} portable ultrasound unit commercially available in the United States, being released in 1975. This unit weighed about 25 lbs, had 3 linear probes to choose from and used an oscilloscope for a display instead of a TV monitor. ADR was later purchased by ATL which later spun off its portable technology into a company that became Sonosite. ATL was later purchased by Philips while Sonosite came out with its first battery powered portable offering, the Sonosite 180 released in 1999. Previous to this, Ecton produced a low-cost portable cardiac <b>ultrasound</b> <b>system</b> that could be carried by hand in March 1998, called the Sonnet [...] but the test prototypes were never put into full-scale production because of difficulty finding venture capital. Ecton was purchased by Acuson in 1999 and the Sonnet system was released as the Acuson Cypress Cypress portable <b>ultrasound</b> <b>system</b> in 2000. The first battery powered portable was the Organon Teknika MiniVisor produced in 1979, but which saw only limited production. The device was created by {{a team led by}} Klaas Bom of the Erasmus MC and Organon Teknika. The first dual-touch screen portable the Hyperion <b>ultrasound</b> <b>system</b> distributed through Graydon Pierce Imaging is designed specifically for the most hostile and demanding medical environments - Military Medical Applications (MEDCOM), Emergency Medical Services, Trauma Centers and Humanitarian Relief Operations.

50|$|Untargeted microbubbles, {{such as the}} {{aforementioned}} SonoVue, Optison, or Levovist, are injected intravenously into the systemic circulation in a small bolus. The microbubbles {{will remain in the}} systemic circulation for a certain period of time. During that time, ultrasound waves are directed on the area of interest. When microbubbles in the blood flow past the imaging window, the microbubbles’ compressible gas cores oscillate in response to the high frequency sonic energy field, as described in the ultrasound article. The microbubbles reflect a unique echo that stands {{in stark contrast to the}} surrounding tissue due to the orders of magnitude mismatch between microbubble and tissue echogenicity. The <b>ultrasound</b> <b>system</b> converts the strong echogenicity into a contrast-enhanced image of the area of interest. In this way, the bloodstream’s echo is enhanced, thus allowing the clinician to distinguish blood from surrounding tissues.|$|E
