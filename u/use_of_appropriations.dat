60|$|Legislation is {{desirable}} to render more efficient this {{branch of the}} public service. All {{the recommendations of the}} Secretary of War I regard as judicious, and I especially commend to your attention the following: The consolidation of Government arsenals; the restoration of mileage to officers traveling under orders; the exemption of money received from the sale of subsistence stores from being covered into the Treasury; the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>appropriations</b> for the purchase of subsistence stores without waiting for the beginning of the fiscal year for which the appropriation is made; for additional appropriations for the collection of torpedo material; for increased appropriations for the manufacture of arms; for relieving the various States from indebtedness for arms charged to them during the rebellion; for dropping officers from the rolls of the Army without trial for the offense of drawing pay more than once for the same period; for the discouragement of the plan to pay soldiers by cheek, and {{for the establishment of a}} professorship of rhetoric and English literature at West Point. The reasons for these recommendations are obvious, and are set forth sufficiently in the reports attached. I also recommend that the status of the staff corps of the Army be fixed, where this has not already been done, so that promotions may be made and vacancies filled as they occur in each grade when reduced below the number to be fixed by law. The necessity for such legislation is specially felt now in the Pay Department. The number of officers in that department is below the number adequate to the performance of the duties required of them by law.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} how firms’ {{degree of}} openness and innovativeness influence their <b>use</b> <b>of</b> {{formal and informal}} appropriation mechanisms. Patents, trademarks, copyrights, and design rights are formal appropriation mechanisms. Secrecy, lead-time, and complexity are examples <b>of</b> informal <b>appropriation</b> mechanisms. Both external search breadth and depth are positively associated with firms’ <b>use</b> <b>of</b> informal <b>appropriation</b> mechanisms, while only external search breadth is positively associated with formal appropriation mechanisms. Firms’ degree of radical (incremental) innovation orientation is negatively (positively) associated with their <b>use</b> <b>of</b> formal <b>appropriation</b> mechanisms. Analysis <b>of</b> the joint impact of openness and innovativeness, suggests that for radical innovators it is external search breadth (rather than depth) that has a positive association with the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> informal <b>appropriation</b> mechanisms. In contrast, for radical innovators external search depth (rather than breadth) {{is associated with the}} <b>use</b> <b>of</b> formal <b>appropriation</b> mechanisms.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This report reviews the Department of Defense's (DOD) handling of appropriated funds from expired appropriation accounts. In 1990, Congress changed the law governing the use of appropriation accounts because it concluded that controls over them were not working. Without adequate controls, Congress was concerned that agencies could disburse money in amounts and for purposes {{that it had not}} approved. GAO found that DOD improperly charged appropriation accounts after they were closed. GAO also found that DOD did not establish the requisite systems, controls, and managerial attention required to properly account for its disbursements consistent with the 1990 account closing law. As a result, DOD made at least $ 615 million of illegal or otherwise improper adjustments during fiscal year 2000 alone. DOD was aware of the limitations the account closing law placed on the availability of canceled appropriations and that the law was enacted because of previous abuses by DOD. DOD also knew that a major system used to control its <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>appropriations</b> allowed for disbursements to be charged {{in a way that was}} inconsistent with the law. However, DOD did nothing to fix the system, even though the cost to do so was minimal. The $ 615 million of adjustments GAO identified as illegal or otherwise improper must be immediately reversed. Also, at a minimum, DOD will need to change its systems, policies, and procedures, along with the weak control environment that fostered these practices, and served to perpetuate the problem. GAO summarized this report in testimony before Congress (GAO- 01 - 994 T). ...|$|E
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "USCIS has implemented immigrant integration efforts through outreach activities, educational materials, and a grant program, and established various measures for assessing its grant program, but has not yet set interim milestones for planned evaluations of the program. From 2008 to 2011, OoC reported conducting more than 300 significant outreach events to promote citizenship awareness and civic integration. Further, nearly half of OoCs funding over the past 3 fiscal yearsabout $ 19. 8 millionwas spent on grants aimed at preparing immigrants for the naturalization process. The grants were made to a myriad of governmental and nongovernmental organizations, including public school systems and community and faith-based organizations. OoC has established various measures for assessing grantees performance under its grant program. These measures include, for example, {{the number of participants}} enrolled in grantees citizenship instruction and naturalization preparation programs, the number of participants who passed their naturalization examinations, and the proportion of participants who received grantees services and self-reported that they naturalized during the year of the grant program. However, USCIS has identified inherent limitations with these measures, such as that its data were incomplete in part because data were self-reported by program participants, and not all program participants reported to grantees whether they passed the naturalization examination and naturalized. In January 2011, USCIS drafted a statement of work for a contractor to develop an evaluation plan that would allow USCIS to measure the grant programs performance and long-term impact, and this may help address these limitations. According to USCIS, it did not complete this statement of work or award a contract for an evaluation plan because, at that time, the agency was uncertain whether it would receive appropriations in fiscal year 2011 to continue the grant program, and the program has no authorizing statute. The final fiscal year 2011 law, enacted in April 2011, did allow the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>appropriations</b> to fund the grant program, but USCIS did not proceed with developing an evaluation plan. In November 2011, USCIS reported that it plans to conduct an internal and external evaluation of the program in fiscal years 2012 and 2013, respectively, contingent on appropriations for the grant program. However, USCIS has not yet set interim milestones for these evaluations. Setting such milestones, contingent on the receipt of funding, could help USCIS strengthen its planning for conducting those evaluations, consistent with program management standards. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{contemporary}} dance in Europe appropriation has been productively applied as a production method only from 1990 s. [ [...] . ] Early approaches to and <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> in European {{contemporary dance}} were mostly informed by post-structuralist thought and resisted the individualistic subjective expression through {{operating in a}} semiotic field. Later approaches (those that I intend to focus on in this MA paper) approach and apply appropriation techniques {{in order to achieve}} different modes of expressivity that would go beyond the approaches that were prevailing in and still are largely forming and informing dance creation, performance and perception, namely: the subjective expression (expressing the inner self through movement) and the objective expression (approaching movement not as a self-expression but as an object in itself). I will examine appropriation procedures in the following choreographies: 50 / 50 by Mette Ingvartsen (2004), Le sacre du printemps by Xavier Le Roy (2007) and Rire by Antonia Baehr (2008). On the basis of the analysis of these works I attempt to find out what opportunities the various manners <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> provide the contemporary choreographers with and what those opportunities mean to the authors of dance in terms of their productive process, their artistic expression and their positioning as political subjects. In concrete I will focus my discussion on the following questions: 1. How does the application <b>of</b> artistic <b>appropriation</b> affect contemporary choreographic approaches and choreographic practices? 2. Which subject positions are implied by the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the various procedures <b>of</b> artistic <b>appropriation?</b> 3. What do the various procedures <b>of</b> artistic <b>appropriation</b> indicate in terms of the subject's modes of expressivity? In conclusion, my main aim is to analyse and evaluate what the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> artistic <b>appropriation</b> as a production method means and has done for contemporary European dance practices...|$|R
