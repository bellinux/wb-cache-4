40|$|Abstract. PTG {{materials}} were prepared using TiO 2 as photoconductors, silver palmitate as a reducible silver salt, PHZ as a toner and 2246 as a reducing agent in acrylic acid resin binder. The PTG material was coated onto the PET film and then exposed by <b>UV-meter.</b> Effects {{of the amount}} of TiO 2 and PHZ on the image properties were investigated by means of ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV) and transmission density meter. The formation of silver image was confirmed from the absorption peak around 430 nm and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The results show that the optimum content is that PHZ of 0. 5 g and titanium dioxide of 0. 03 g. The Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) showed that the triangle-like grains with size of 43 nm and height of 10 nm grew uniformly {{on the surface of the}} exposed PTG film...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the use of two instruments to measure the ultraviolet protective factor (UPF) of T-shirt knit fabrics. After various laundering treatments, specimens were cut and UPF was measured from the wale, course, and bias directions with the ISO MET® <b>UV-Meter</b> and the Cary UV-Visible Spectrophotometer. Similar results {{were found between the}} two instruments and among repeated measures. Before UPF measurement, the shirt fabrics were repeatedly laundered using various household detergents and laundering additives commonly available to consumers. Statistically significant effects on the mean UPF values were found related to type of fabric, type of detergent/laundry additives, number of repeated launderings, and interaction effects of combinations of the three factors. Consumers can improve the UPF of their cotton and cotton-blend clothing by using detergents with brightener and/or products containing ultraviolet absorbers. Conclusions and implications for educators and apparel and textiles industry are provided...|$|E
40|$|Background: Welding {{is among}} the most {{important}} frequently used processes in the industry {{with a wide range of}} applications from the food industry to aerospace and from precision tools to shipbuilding. The aim of this study was to assess the level of steel industry welders′ exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation and to investigate the health impacts of these exposures. Methods: In this case-control study, we measured the intensity of UV at the workers′ wrist in Fars Steel Company through manufacture of different types of heavy metal structures, using <b>UV-meter</b> model 666230 made by Leybold Co., from Germany. Results: The population under the study comprised 400 people including 200 welders as the exposed group and 200 nonwelders as the unexposed group. The results of the questionnaire were analyzed using SPSS software, version 19. The average, standard deviation, maximum and minimum of the UV at the welders′ wrist were 0. 362, 0. 346, 1. 27, and 0. 01 μW/cm 2, respectively. There was a significantly (P < 0. 01) higher incidence of cataracts, keratoconjunctivitis, dermatitis and erythema in welders than in their nonwelders. Conclusions: This study showed that the time period of UV exposure in welders is higher than the permissible contact threshold level. Therefore, considering the outbreak of the eye and skin disorders in the welders, decreasing exposure time, reducing UV radiation level, and using personal protective equipment seem indispensable. As exposure to UV radiation can be linked to different types of skin cancer, skin aging, and cataract, welders should be advised to decrease their occupational exposures...|$|E
