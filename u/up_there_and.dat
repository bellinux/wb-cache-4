5|$|At Wonderfontein on 15 December 1879, 6,000 burghers, {{many of them}} {{bearing the}} republic's vierkleur ("four-colour") flag, voted to pursue a restored, {{independent}} republic. Pretorius and Bok were imprisoned on charges of high treason when they took this news to Wolseley and Sir Owen Lanyon (who had replaced Shepstone), prompting many burghers to consider rising <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> then—Kruger persuaded them not to, saying this was premature. Pretorius and Bok were swiftly released after Jorissen telegraphed the British Liberal politician William Ewart Gladstone, who had met Kruger's first deputation in London and had since condemned the annexation as unjust during his Midlothian campaign.|$|E
5|$|The allied {{objective}} was to encircle Humaitá and force its capitulation by siege. On 15 August 1867, under heavy fire, Brazilian warships forced the passage of Curupayty, an outer line of defense of Humaitá. Joaquim Inácio commanded from {{the bridge of the}} ironclad Brasil, which engaged in the operation. Joaquim Inácio was afterwards awarded the noble title of Barão de Inhaúma (Baron of Inhaúma) on 27 September. The name came from Inhaúma, a region (now a neighborhood) near the city of Rio de Janeiro. His wife had grown <b>up</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> he himself owned a coffee farm in the area. Those landowners, including the Baron of Inhaúma, who produced coffee (the most valuable Brazilian export commodity) were the wealthiest and most influential people in Brazil's southeast. They were owners of slaves, and many of them formed the core of the Conservative Party (the ultraconservative wing called saquarema) and were connected to each other through family and political ties.|$|E

25|$|They all got {{together}} <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> {{there was a}} bloody massacre because I think they shot about three hundred natives all in one hit {{and there was a}} hell of a row over it.

25|$|The house, {{built in}} the style of a French château to reflect the Pinchot family's French origins, was {{designed}} by Richard Morris Hunt with some later work by Henry Edwards-Ficken. Situated on the hills above Milford, it overlooks the Delaware River. Pinchot grew <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> returned during the summers when his later life took him to Washington and Harrisburg. His wife Cornelia made substantial changes to the interior of the home and gardens, in collaboration with several different architects, during that time.|$|E

25|$|After {{taking stock}} of the situation, and {{achieving}} a partial financial recovery, the CMU set about building the bridge and viaduct to cross the River Wye at Monmouth, and extend its line {{as far as a}} mineral depot at Wyesham, a mile from Monmouth. A transshipment facility was set <b>up</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> the Monmouth Railway continued to operate, unmodernised, as far as that point. The extension of the CMU from the Troy station to Wyesham opened on 1 July 1861.|$|E
25|$|Hitzfeld {{was born}} in Lörrach in {{the valley of the}} Wiese in {{southwest}} Germany, close to the Swiss border. He grew <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> is the youngest of five children. Hitzfeld said that when he first left Bayern in 2004 he 'felt burnt out' and 'was a bit depressed', and 'it took me two years to recover.' He then had 'the best years at Bayern' on his return. He stated his views that people should not get too excited about things, not get too down about things, and treat each situation individually. His uncle was the World War II general Otto Hitzfeld.|$|E
25|$|Webb {{was born}} in Detroit in 1905 and grew <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> in a Quaker {{community}} in Ontario. From 19241929 {{he worked as a}} bank teller and clerk at a brokerage firm in Detroit; in another account, he was a successful stockbroker during the 1920s but lost his earnings during the Crash before the Depression. During the Depression beginning in 1929, he moved to California and worked as a prospector and earned a meager living. During these years he also worked as a fire ranger for the United States Forestry Service. Webb reportedly wrote short stories which were unpublished. After 1934, Webb returned to Detroit and worked for the automobile manufacturer Chrysler in their export division. In 1937, he visited a friend in Panama in search of gold, but had little success. But in Panama, he brought along a camera donated by his former employer, Chrysler.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the large}} number of people inquiring after other people, the {{received}} wisdom of the wee morning hours was that most, if not all, people had gotten out alive. Among the police and fire fighters, this idea stemmed largely from the last searches of District Engineer Farley: no one had been seen in the parquet or parquet circle. No one had been seen in the dress circle. It was true that no one had physically checked the gallery, but people had called <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> received no reply, nor were there sounds of movement. The inclination was to hope for the best. True, when Charles Vine dropped himself off the gallery there had still been hundreds of people struggling on the staircase, but Vine had sought medical assistance for his deep cuts, so what he knew was not general knowledge. When the morning papers went to press, none carried news of casualties.|$|E

[...] "I've got a boy under my wing down here in Texas who's a football-playing fool and I {{want him to go}} to Centre.

500|$|A {{supporter}} of the Democratic Party, Ebert publicly urged liberal filmmaker Michael Moore to give a politically charged acceptance speech at the Academy Awards: [...] "I'd like to see Michael Moore get <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> let 'em have it with both barrels and really let loose {{and give them a}} real rabble-rousing speech." [...] During a 1996 panel at the University of Colorado at Boulder's Conference on World Affairs, Ebert coined the Boulder Pledge, by which he vowed never to purchase anything offered through the result of an unsolicited email message, or to forward chain emails or mass emails to others. Ebert endorsed Barack Obama for re-election as President in 2012.|$|E
500|$|Van der Byl {{moved to}} Southern Rhodesia in 1950 to manage {{some of his}} family's tobacco farming interests, hoping {{to make his own}} fortune. Having visited the country many times as a youth, he remarked that after reading about the profits to be made from tobacco he [...] "suddenly got a rush of blood to the crotch about the tobacco boom and decided I was going to go <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> make the family fortune in a place I liked and wanted to be in." [...] He welcomed the move as it allowed him to indulge his hobby of big game hunting: in that year in Angola, then under Portuguese rule, he set a world record for the biggest {{elephant}} shot, which stood until 1955.|$|E

[...] She admires Diana Ross as an [...] "all-around entertainer" [...] and Whitney Houston, who she said [...] "inspired me to get <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> do what she did." [...] She credits Mariah Carey's singing and her song [...] "Vision of Love" [...] as influencing her to begin practicing vocal runs as a child.

It was advantageous to us on so many levels, that it was just the right place to go for this movie," [...] Perry stated as the reason for the film's production in British Columbia. British Columbia Highway 19 was utilized as Route 23. The Plaza of Nations was used as a stand-in for Ellis Medical Complex, the site of Tim's death.|$|E
