40|$|Detached-eddy {{simulations}} for the M 219 experimental cavity {{geometry and}} the 1303 <b>uninhabited</b> <b>combat</b> <b>air</b> <b>vehicle</b> cavity geometry are presented. First, results from three computations {{are presented with}} the aim of studying the effect of imposing synthetic velocity fluctuations at the inflow boundary. Both methods employed (synthetic-eddy method and fluctuations from a precursor large-eddy simulation) increased the high-frequency content in the boundary layer upstream of the cavity. Averaged profiles showed little change in the streamwise velocity; however, the profiles of normal velocity were noticeably different. The influence of the upstream boundary layer on the cavity flowfield means that the full aircraft geometry needed to be modeled. Consequently, advanced multiblock topologies had to be used to properly represent the planform of the <b>uninhabited</b> <b>combat</b> <b>air</b> <b>vehicle</b> and all the details of the cavity, including doors and hinges, while sliding meshes were needed to insert the store into the <b>uninhabited</b> <b>combat</b> <b>air</b> <b>vehicle</b> configuration. Results with an empty cavity were encouraging for such complex configurations. Visualizations using the Q criteria revealed the added turbulent content due to the door leading edges and the door hinges. The addition of a store in between the doors had little effect close to the front wall. However, averaged flowfields showed that the proximity of the shear layer to the apex of the store deflected it downward into the cavity and restricted its growth. Outside the cavity, shedding was observed from the sting and force balance...|$|E

40|$|The {{projected}} use of <b>Uninhabited</b> <b>Combat</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Vehicles</b> (UCAVs) in <b>combat</b> missions {{raises the}} challenge of providing the intelligent functionality {{that will allow them}} to carry out their tasks in autonomous mode. This challenge is composed by the fact that UCAVs will have to act in a dynamic environment, which will constantly require changes in the mission plans. In this paper, we present an approach to the autonomy of planbased mission execution in the context of multi-UCAV missions. In particular, we concentrate on two essential aspects of mission execution: the assessment of the mission environment, and the adjustment of UCAV plans to the variations in the mission environment. The situation assessment and plan modification are discussed within the framework of an agent-based simulation environment, which allows the high-fidelity replication of the actual mission environment and allows users to experiment with UCAV capabilities in various types of combat situations.

Some of the challenges associated with both the vehicle-class aerodynamics and the fundamental vortical flows are reviewed, and principles from a hierarchical complexity approach are used to relate flow fundamentals to system-level interests.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the structure of}} the flow within the engine inlet of an <b>uninhabited</b> <b>combat</b> <b>air</b> <b>vehicle</b> (UCAV). The UCAV features a top-mounted, serpentine inlet leading to an engine buried within the fuselage. The performance of the inlet is found to depend strongly on a flow separation that occurs within the inlet. Both the time-averaged and the unsteady structure of this separation is studied, and an argument relating the inlet performance to the behaviour of this separation is suggested. The results presented in this paper also suggest that there are considerable aerodynamic limitations to further shortening or narrowing of the inlet. Since there are substantial, system level benefits from using a smaller inlet, the case for separated flow control therefore appears clear...|$|E
40|$|Optimal {{formation}} reconfiguration {{control of}} multiple <b>Uninhabited</b> <b>Combat</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Vehicles</b> (UCAVs) {{is a complicated}} global optimum problem. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a population based stochastic optimization technique inspired by social behaviour of bird flocking or fish schooling. PSO can achieve better results in a faster, cheaper way compared with other bio-inspired computational methods, and there are few parameters to adjust in PSO. In this paper, we propose an improved PSO model for solving the optimal formation reconfiguration control problem for multiple UCAVs. Firstly, the Control Parameteri-zation and Time Discretization (CPTD) method is designed in detail. Then, the mutation strategy and a special mutation-escape operator are adopted in the improved PSO model to make particles explore the search space more efficiently. The proposed strategy can produce a large speed value dynamically according to the variation of the speed, which makes the algorithm explore the local and global minima thoroughly at the same time. Series experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method in solving the optimal formation reconfiguration control problem for multiple UCAVs...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} the Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) approach for the computation of flows around <b>uninhabited</b> <b>combat</b> <b>air</b> <b>vehicles.</b> One {{of the key}} features of this new family of aircraft is that weapon bays are used to enhance stealth characteristics and improve aerodynamic performance. The highly energetic flow-field within the weapon bays can change dramatically the aerodynamics of these aircraft {{and for this reason}} detailed CFD analyses are needed to provide insight in the change of loads encountered when weapon bays are exposed. In contrast to previous studies where idealised, isolated cavities are used as model problems, a realistic aircraft geometry is used in this work. Computations using DES are presented for the clean aircraft, the idealised cavity and the complete configuration. Advanced multi-block topologies are used which allow for most of the geometric details of the aircraft to be preserved and resolved by the employed CFD solver. For all cases where weapon bays are present, DES is used for the simulation while statistical turbulence models prove to be adequate for the clean aircraft cases. Comparisons against experimental data demonstrate the accuracy of the employed methods and strengthen confidence in the employed DES models. The overall loading of the aircraft is well-predicted even at high angles of attack and DES appears to offer encouraging results at low and high Mach number cases. Experiments conducted by QinetiQ and DSTL are used for validation of the DES method and results indicate that less than 3 dB discrepancies in the overall sound pressure level can be obtained in comparison to the tunnel data...|$|R
40|$|This chapter offers {{insights}} about decisions {{that will be}} considered {{in the early years of}} this decade regarding modernization of the combat platforms the U. S. Air Force fields. The focus is on systems that either are currently fielded (the B- 1 bomber), are in advanced development (the F- 22), or are close to decisions on whether they are to become major programs (the Joint Strike Fighter [JSF]). Other efforts are under way that might provide new combat platforms in the more distant future, including designs for <b>uninhabited</b> <b>combat</b> <b>air</b> <b>vehicles,</b> and craft that transit space en route to their targets. But it is not possible to assess these systems with the same level of fidelity as the more mature systems treated here because the operational concepts for these and other concepts have not yet been sufficiently developed, and their performance parameters have not yet been sufficiently defined. We do assess near-term platform modernization options in light of the air-delivered weapons and munitions that are planned for the coming two decades or could be fielded within that time frame. Recognizing that the Air Force, like its sister services, plays important roles in advancing U. S. interests in peacetime, as well as in war, the chapter examines the demands of both conflict and routine, peacetime “presence ” operations. MISSIONS Any consideration of force size and mix must begin with an understanding of what such forces are likely to be called on to do. Specifically, planners approaching the task of evaluating options for future forces must have some insights into the following questions...|$|R
30|$|Bat Algorithm (BA) {{is a new}} {{bio-inspired}} {{optimization technique}} proposed in [23]. The algorithm is inspired by the social behavior of bats and the phenomenon of echolocation to sense distance. BA mimics the variations of pulse emission rates and loudness of bats when searching for prey and has shown a typical quick start. It is simple, robust, easy to implement and also significantly faster than other optimization techniques. It has been successfully applied to solve diverse engineering optimization problems such as power system stabilizer [24], <b>uninhabited</b> <b>combat</b> <b>air</b> <b>vehicle</b> (UCAV) path planning [25], economic dispatch [26], load frequency control [27], planning the sports training [28], fuel arrangement optimization of reactor core [29], feature selection [30], etc. The algorithm obtained good results when dealing with lower-dimensional optimization problems, but may become problematic for higher-dimensional problems because it tends to converge very fast initially [31]. The standard BA is usually quick at the exploitation of the solution though its exploration ability is relatively poor [25].|$|E
40|$|Path {{planning}} for <b>uninhabited</b> <b>combat</b> <b>air</b> <b>vehicle</b> (UCAV) {{is a complicated}} high dimension optimization problem, which mainly centralizes on optimizing the flight route considering {{the different kinds of}} constrains under complicated battle field environments. Original bat algorithm (BA) is used to solve the UCAV path planning problem. Furthermore, a new bat algorithm with mutation (BAM) is proposed to solve the UCAV path planning problem, and a modification is applied to mutate between bats during the process of the new solutions updating. Then, the UCAV can find the safe path by connecting the chosen nodes of the coordinates while avoiding the threat areas and costing minimum fuel. This new approach can accelerate the global convergence speed while preserving the strong robustness of the basic BA. The realization procedure for original BA and this improved metaheuristic approach BAM is also presented. To prove the performance of this proposed metaheuristic method, BAM is compared with BA and other population-based optimization methods, such as ACO, BBO, DE, ES, GA, PBIL, PSO, and SGA. The experiment shows that the proposed approach is more effective and feasible in UCAV path planning than the other models...|$|E
40|$|Three {{independent}} {{studies from}} the United States (NASA), Sweden (FOI), and Australia (DSTO) are analyzed {{to assess the}} state of current unstructured-grid computational fluid dynamic tools and practices for predicting the complex static and dynamic aerodynamic and stability characteristics of a generic 53 -degree swept, round-leading-edge <b>uninhabited</b> <b>combat</b> <b>air</b> <b>vehicle</b> configuration, called SACCON. NASA exercised the USM 3 D tetrahedral cell-centered flow solver, while FOI and DSTO applied the FOI/EDGE general-cell vertex-based solver. The authors primarily employ the Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) assumption, with a limited assessment of the EDGE Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) extension, to explore sensitivities to grids and turbulence models. Correlations with experimental data are provided for force and moments, surface pressure, and off-body flow measurements. The vortical flow field over SACCON proved extremely difficult to model adequately. As a general rule, the prospect of obtaining reasonable correlations of SACCON pitching moment characteristics with the RANS formulation is not promising, even for static cases. Yet, dynamic pitch oscillation results seem to produce a promising characterization of shapes for the lift and pitching moment hysteresis curves. Future studies of this configuration should include more investigation with higher-fidelity turbulence models, such as DES...|$|E

A new hybrid metaheuristic differential evolution (DE) and cuckoo search (CS) algorithm is proposed to solve the UCAV three-dimension {{path planning}} problem. DE is applied to optimize the process of selecting cuckoos of the improved CS model during the process of cuckoo updating in nest. The cuckoos can act as an agent in searching the optimal UCAV path.

This new approach can accelerate the global convergence speed while preserving the strong robustness of the basic CS. The realization procedure for this hybrid metaheuristic approach DE/CS is also presented. In order to make the optimized UCAV path more feasible, the B-Spline curve is adopted for smoothing the path. To prove the performance of this proposed hybrid metaheuristic method, it is compared with basic CS algorithm. The experiment shows that the proposed approach is more effective and feasible in UCAV three-dimension path planning than the basic CS model...|$|E
