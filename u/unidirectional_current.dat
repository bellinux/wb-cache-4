40|$|Rates of mass {{transfer}} in coral reefs are governed {{both by the}} physical flow environment and the morphology of the coral. Laboratory experiments were conducted to estimate {{mass transfer}} in unidirectional and oscillatory flows by measuring the rate of dissolution of gypsum cylinders (clods) placed within the branching structure of three morphologically distinct coral species. Unidirectional flows were varied between 2. 9 and 14. 1 cm s� 1 and, as expected, mass transfer rates increased with increasing flow and a more open branch spacing. Depending on morphology and flow, mass transfer rates within {{the interior of the}} branching structure were 50 to 75 % of that measured outside the coral in free-stream conditions. Oscillatory conditions showed relative mass transfer rates 1. 6 to 2. 9 times greater than equivalent <b>unidirectional</b> <b>currents.</b> This ratio increased with increasing wave frequency, likely due to the corresponding decrease in the diffusive boundary layer thickness. The ratio also increased with a greater compactness in branch spacing, with mass transfer rates within the coral structure up to 130 % of free-stream conditions.

5000|$|In the circuit, {{the grid}} of the {{detector}} (usually a low-mu or medium-mu triode) {{is connected to}} the secondary of the final RF or IF transformer through a capacitor, the [...] "grid leak capacitor" [...] of 100 pF to 330 pF, with 250 pF being typical. A large resistor, the [...] "grid leak resistor" [...] of a few hundred kΩ to 10 MΩ is connected either in parallel with this capacitor, or from the detector's grid to ground. The resistor-capacitor combination, in concert with the nearly <b>unidirectional</b> <b>current</b> flow of the detector's grid-to-cathode (or grid-to-filament, if it's directly heated) circuit, forms a clamp circuit. The incoming modulated radio frequency signal voltage swings both positive and negative with respect to ground as it emerges from the final RF or IF stage. The detector's grid-to-cathode circuit will only conduct current when the grid is positive with respect to the cathode. The resulting current flow charges the capacitor to maintain a voltage which biases the detector grid negative with respect to its cathode. The amount of bias varies based on the received signal strength. The grid leak resistor - capacitor circuit is designed to have a time constant which is slightly slower than the rate of change of the audio program and much slower than the rate of change of the carrier. Because the bias varies depending on signal strength, plate current will rise on very low signals, and operation near cut-off of the tube will cause distortion. On receivers with battery powered heaters, the heater power supply could be used to bias the tube with a small positive voltage.The nearly <b>unidirectional</b> <b>current</b> flow of the received, modulated signal results in a separate audio signal that is said to be detected or demodulated. The triode detector tube also amplifies this audio signal, thereby providing two processes in one tube. Regenerative detectors often used grid leak, especially in the detection of amplitude modulated signals.|$|E

50|$|Letheby {{designed}} an interrupter circuit for {{use with}} induction coils for the medical application of electricity. The function of an interrupter circuit is to continually make and break the supply to the induction coil, which causes the coil to generate a large back emf at its output each time it is switched. Early interrupters were operated by hand, but Golding Bird introduced an automatic interrupter which worked electromagnetically in 1838. The problem with Bird's interrupter, and the problem that Letheby wished to solve, was that the direction of flow of the electric current was in opposite directions during the make and the break operations. Medical applications of electricity often required a <b>unidirectional</b> <b>current,</b> particularly when treating nervous disorders. Letheby's design caused only either the make or the break current to flow to the patient by a mechanical arrangement of two spoked wheels. Letherby proposed that a further advantage of his machine was that the pulses from the make contact provided a rather lesser shock to the patient than the pulses from the break contact. This gave the physician some control in situation where large shocks were not needed.|$|E

We couple a semiconductor drift-diffusion model to a magnetic field in order to describe the electromagnetic effects associated with electrical currents flowing within rocks.

40|$|This note {{describes}} the scour induced by tidal currents around piles under live-bed conditions, {{on the basis}} of physical model tests carried out at Aalborg University (DK). Fine sand was placed in a flume equipped with a reversible pump. Scour was leveled by an automatic laser profiler. Experimental time evolution of scour is satisfactorily given by a simple rule, function of the volume occupied by the pile, the test duration and the sediment mobility. Such rule allows for a quantitative description of erosion in equilibrium conditions, although with some uncertainty. The scour depth S is S/D≈ 1. 3 (D is the pile diameter). For <b>unidirectional</b> <b>currents,</b> eroded volume V at the pile is V/D 3 ≈ 13, the hole having an assymmetrical shape. For tidal currents, two cases are distinguished, when tidal period is much longer or much shorter than time scale of erosion: in the first case the hole is asymmetric and keeps “drifting with the tide” with volume V/D 3 ≈ 16; in the second case the hole is symmetric and is stable, with volume V/D^ 3 ≈ 13...|$|R
