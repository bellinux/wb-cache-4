50|$|Giobbi {{founded the}} Lisa Giobbi Movement Theatre {{while working on}} circus arts and dance with Circus Flora and working as staff {{choreographer}} for the Big Apple Circus. Giobbi performed aerial work most notably at The Joyce Theatre in NY, La Scala in Milan and La Fenice in Venice, {{as well as the}} Boston Dance <b>Umbrella</b> <b>Aerial</b> festivals, the Frequent Flyers Festival and the Santa Rosalia Festival in Palermo. She was a three-time guest artist of the Deutsche Opera in Berlin.|$|E
50|$|The Experimental Radio Station Eberswalde was an {{experimental}} radio station {{of the company}} Carl Lorenz founded in Eberswalde, Germany in 1909. It used an <b>umbrella</b> <b>aerial,</b> which was carried at a 70 metres high, guyed central mast and at the corners on 16 30 metres high timber masts, as antenna system. The central mast was a wood-latticed mast with a weight of 10,2 tons, guyed in 5 levels. As transmitters arc and machine transmitters were used, which served mainly {{for the purpose of}} telegraphy. Between January 1923 until January 1925, music transmissions were also done, although the station was never a regular broadcasting station. Starting from 1924, the station was used for short wave experiments. In 1928, the first experimental radio beacon was built on the Experimental Radio Station Eberswalde. It worked in the medium-wave band and used a triangle plane aerial, which was hung up on three 28 metres tall masts. Starting from middle of the 1930s, the Experimental Radio Station Eberswalde was gradually shut down. In 1939, the entire antenna systems including the central mast were dismantled. Starting from 1942, the buildings were used for a research centre for peat utilization. One hoped {{to be able to make}} fuel from peat. From 1954 to 1963, the facilities, which are unused today, served for the forest-economy faculty of the Humboldt University of Berlin.|$|E
50|$|It {{was part}} of an {{omnidirectional}} aerial, consisting of four 200-metre-high radio masts, which were connected using wires on their tops. The middle mast was fed via radio power. This very efficient transmission aerial led to interference with the Romanian transmitter Braşov on the same frequency, so only 70 kilowatts of power were used, instead of 250. But even with this reduced power, jamming of Braşov occurred, so in 1972 the radio facility Donebach was rebuilt as a directional aerial with a minimum towards Braşov. Therefore two radio masts were taken down and the remaining two were rebuilt as <b>umbrella</b> <b>aerials.</b> This made a transmission power of 250 kilowatts possible.|$|R
50|$|Operation Niagara was a U.S. Seventh Air Force close {{air support}} {{campaign}} carried out from January through March 1968, during the Vietnam War. Its purpose was {{to serve as an}} <b>aerial</b> <b>umbrella</b> for the defense of the U.S. Marine Corps Combat Base on the Khe Sanh Plateau, in western Quang Tri Province of the Republic of Vietnam. The base was under siege by an estimated three-divisional force of the Peoples Army of Vietnam (PAVN).|$|R
