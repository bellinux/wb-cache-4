5|$|In 1995, {{a tunnel}} was {{proposed}} {{as part of}} the Connector, traveling <b>underneath</b> Horace J. Bryant Drive; however, the idea was rejected by Mayor James Whelan and the City Council as it would have displaced many homes in the area. The same year, Mirage Resorts president Steve Wynn proposed a new casino resort in the marina district, and stated that resort would not be built unless there was better access to the site. Additional plans were later researched, and six different plans were proposed. The plans included the tunnel <b>underneath</b> Horace J. Bryant Drive, a tunnel <b>underneath</b> the adjacent Penrose Canal, two alternative tunnel locations, the elevated highway above the wetlands, and the improvement of existing streets to direct traffic through the city. Transportation officials determined all of the plans, except for the first two tunnel proposals, to have significant drawbacks.|$|E

5|$|In early July, {{widespread}} {{showers and}} thunderstorms developed across the Western Pacific <b>underneath</b> a tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT). On July9, a single cumulonimbus cloud west of Wake Island became {{associated with the}} TUTT and quickly organized. By July11, the system featured a small central dense overcast and soon became sufficiently organized for the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to declare it as Tropical Depression 11W. Upon classification, the system was located roughly 320km (200mi) east of the Northern Mariana Islands. The development of the depression was unprecedented in two ways: first, a single cloud developed into a tropical cyclone; and second, it became tropical while situated <b>underneath</b> a cold-core low.|$|E

Bone analysis has identified the remains as being those of someone foreign to Copán.|$|E

5|$|The skyway was a {{constraint}} in {{the building}} of the New Jersey Turnpike in 1951. The turnpike had to be built low enough to provide enough clearance <b>underneath</b> the skyway, but high enough to then provide sufficient clearance over the nearby Passaic River. Turnpike engineers could have built over the skyway (at a much higher cost) or under the skyway's trusses; the latter option was chosen. As part of a 2005 seismic retrofit project, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority lowered the Passaic River Viaduct Bridge on its easterly alignment to increase vertical clearance and allow for full-width shoulders <b>underneath</b> the Pulaski Skyway. Engineers replaced the bearings and lowered the turnpike bridge by , without shutting it to traffic.|$|E
