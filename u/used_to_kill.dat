5|$|Hygiene {{is a set}} of {{practices}} to avoid infection or food spoilage by eliminating microorganisms from the surroundings. As microorganisms, in particular bacteria, are found virtually everywhere, harmful microorganisms may be reduced to acceptable levels rather than actually eliminated. In food preparation, microorganisms are reduced by preservation methods such as cooking, cleanliness of utensils, short storage periods, or by low temperatures. If complete sterility is needed, as with surgical equipment, an autoclave is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> microorganisms with heat and pressure.|$|E
5|$|Radioactive samarium-153 is a {{beta emitter}} with a {{half-life}} of 46.3 hours. It is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> cancer {{cells in the}} treatment of lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, and osteosarcoma. For this purpose, samarium-153 is chelated with ethylene diamine tetramethylene phosphonate (EDTMP) and injected intravenously. The chelation prevents accumulation of radioactive samarium in the body that would result in excessive irradiation and generation of new cancer cells. The corresponding drug has several names including samarium (153Sm) lexidronam; its trade name is Quadramet.|$|E

5|$|The {{efficacy}} of chemical pesticides tends to diminish over time. This is because any organism that manages {{to survive the}} initial application will pass on its genes to its offspring and a resistant strain will be developed. In this way, {{some of the most}} serious pests have developed resistance and are no longer killed by pesticides that <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> their ancestors. This necessitates higher concentrations of chemical, more frequent applications and a movement to more expensive formulations.|$|E
5|$|The episode opens {{showing a}} horde of walkers as they follow a {{helicopter}} overhead, leaving Atlanta and migrating to the countryside over several days. As they near the Greene farm, they {{hear the sound of}} a gunshotfrom the shot that Carl (Chandler Riggs) <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> a reanimated Shane Walshand they turn to head towards the farm. As Rick (Andrew Lincoln) escorts Carl back to the others, the walker horde emerges from the forest, and Rick and Carl take shelter in the barn.|$|E
5|$|Warfarin has {{traditionally}} been <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> rodents, but many populations have developed resistance to this anticoagulant, and difenacoum is often substituted. These are cumulative poisons, requiring bait stations to be topped up regularly. Poisoned meat {{has been used for}} centuries to kill animals such as wolves and birds of prey. Poisoned carcasses however kill a wide range of carrion feeders, not only the targeted species. Raptors in Israel were nearly wiped out following a period of intense poisoning of rats and other crop pests.|$|E

5|$|A {{few other}} non-essential heavy metals {{have one or}} more toxic forms. Kidney failure and {{fatalities}} have been recorded arising from the ingestion of germanium dietary supplements (~15 to 300g in total consumed {{over a period of}} two months to three years). Exposure to osmium tetroxide (OsO4) may cause permanent eye damage and can lead to respiratory failure and death. Indium salts are toxic if more than few milligrams are ingested and will affect the kidneys, liver, and heart. Cisplatin (PtCl2(NH3)2), which is an important drug <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> cancer cells, is also a kidney and nerve poison. Bismuth compounds can cause liver damage if taken in excess; insoluble uranium compounds, as well as the dangerous radiation they emit, can cause permanent kidney damage.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, Israeli AH-64As {{frequently}} attacked Hezbollah outposts in Lebanon. On 13 April 1996, during Operation Grapes of Wrath, an Apache fired two Hellfire {{missiles at}} an ambulance in Lebanon, killing six civilians. During the al-Aqsa Intifada in the 2000s, AH-64s were <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> senior Hamas figures, such as Ahmed Yassin, Abed al-Aziz Rantissi, and Adnan al-Ghoul. On 24 May 2001, a privately owned Lebanese-registered Cessna 152 flew 15 minutes {{down the coast}} over Israeli airspace, refused to identify and respond to contact and a warning shot before it was shot down by an IAF AH-64A. IAF Apaches played {{a prominent role in}} the 2006 Lebanon War, launching strikes into Lebanon targeting Hezbollah forces.|$|E
5|$|In October 1995, a Houston jury convicted Saldívar {{of first-degree}} murder and sentenced her {{to life in prison}} with the {{possibility}} of parole after 30 years in 2025.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione set out to complete the mission Dumbledore gave Harry by hunting down and destroying Voldemort's Horcruxes. Meanwhile, Severus Snape informs Lord Voldemort and the Death Eaters of Harry's impending departure from Privet Drive. Voldemort commandeers Lucius Malfoy's wand, as Voldemort's own wand cannot be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> Harry because they share the same core.|$|E

The practice of targeted killing had previously been accepted in situations of self-defense in military settings; after the attacks it was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> non-combatants and those not directly involved in a particular armed force.|$|E
5|$|Targeted Killings: Law and Morality in an Asymmetrical World is a non-fiction {{compilation}} {{book about}} targeted killing edited by Claire Finkelstein, Jens David Ohlin, and Andrew Altman. It {{was published by}} Oxford University Press in 2012. The book grew out of contributions by the authors to a conference in April 2011 at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Targeted Killings features eighteen essays in five sections arranged by topic. The work argues that after the 11 September attacks by Al-Qaeda in 2001, the United States and other countries {{began to see the}} tactic of targeted killing differently.

5|$|The case of Claudius' {{poisoning}} is more complex. Claudius {{was known}} to have been very fond of eating Caesar's mushroom. Following his death, many sources have attributed it to his being fed a meal of death caps instead of Caesar's mushrooms. Ancient authors, such as Tacitus and Suetonius, are unanimous about poison having been added to the mushroom dish, rather than the dish having been prepared from poisonous mushrooms. Wasson speculated the poison <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> Claudius was derived from death caps, with a fatal dose of an unknown poison (possibly a variety of nightshade) being administered later during his illness.|$|E
5|$|The {{recovered}} beef {{material is}} extruded through long tubes that are thinner than a pencil, {{during which time}} at the Beef Products, Inc. (BPI) processing plant, the meat is exposed to gaseous ammonia. At Cargill Meat Solutions, citric acid is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella. Gaseous ammonia {{in contact with the}} water in the meat produces ammonium hydroxide. The ammonia sharply increases the pH and damages microscopic organisms, the freezing causes ice crystals to form and puncture the organisms' weakened cell walls, and the mechanical stress destroys the organisms altogether. The product is finely ground, compressed into pellets or blocks, flash frozen and then shipped for use as an additive.|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosaurus {{may have}} had {{infectious}} saliva <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> its prey. This theory was first proposed by William Abler. Abler examined the teeth of tyrannosaurids between each tooth serration; the serrations may have held pieces of carcass with bacteria, giving Tyrannosaurus a deadly, infectious bite much like the Komodo dragon was thought to have. Jack Horner regards Tyrannosaurus tooth serrations as more like cubes in shape than the serrations on a Komodo monitor's teeth, which are rounded. All forms of saliva contain possibly hazardous bacteria, so the prospect of it {{being used as a}} method of predation is disputable.|$|E
