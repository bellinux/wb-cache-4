60|$|The {{poor old}} black cook! <b>Unlashing</b> his hammock for the night, {{and finding a}} wet log fast asleep in it; and then waking {{in the morning with}} his woolly head tarred. Opening his coppers, and finding an old boot boiling away as saucy as could be, and {{sometimes}} cakes of pitch candying in his oven.|$|E
60|$|<b>Unlashing</b> and {{removing}} the cover, Godfrey {{sat up and}} looked round. The gale had broken. Black clouds were hurrying past overhead, but there were patches of blue sky. The sea was still very heavy, but it was rarely that the canoe dipped her nose under a wave, so lightly did she rise and fall over them.|$|E
60|$|No {{first-class}} ship's steward {{can exist}} without possessing {{a more than}} average measure of executive ability. Dag Daughtry was a first-class ship's steward. Placing the Ancient Mariner in a nook of safety, and setting Big John to <b>unlashing</b> the remaining boat and hooking on the falls, he sent Kwaque into the hold to fill kegs {{of water from the}} scant remnant of supply, and Ah Moy to clear out the food in the galley.|$|E

6000|$|Well, {{here were}} these poor Frenchmen being carried off. What could we do? Very little of a {{permanent}} sort, but {{we did what we}} could. We sent a messenger flying to Joan, and we and the French guards halted the procession for a parley--to gain time, you see. A big Burgundian lost his temper and swore a great oath that none should stop him; he would go, and would take his prisoner with him. But we blocked him off, and he saw that he was mistaken about going--he couldn't do it. He exploded into the maddest cursings and revilings, then, and, <b>unlashing</b> his prisoner from his back, stood him up, all bound and helpless; then drew his knife, and said to us with a light of sarcasting triumph in his eye: ...|$|E
40|$|In economy nowadays, {{the act of}} {{innovation}} is in general social; it requires the management of knowledge, and the techniques and methodologies to drive it. Innovation is not the product of one isolated intelligence, instead, it {{is the result of}} a multi-disciplinary workgroup lead by a process or a methodology. The conceptual design, which is found in the first stages of the innovation process, represents one of the most important challenges in industry nowadays. One of the main challenges faced by chemical industries related to the conceptual design phase is to provide the means in the form of methods and computational tools, for solving problems systematically, at the same time that benefiting from the collective efforts of individual intelligences involved. Hence, the main objective of this work is to provide a solution to improve the creative capacity of a team involved in the innovation process, in particular the preliminary (critical) phase of conceptual design. Consequently, it is important to understand the techniques, methods and tools that best support the generation of novel ideas and creative solutions. In addition, it is necessary to study the contribution of information and communication technologies as the mean to support collaboration. Web technologies are considered as complementary tools to implement methods and techniques in collaborative design, and particularly in the conceptual design stage. These technologies allow setting up distributed collaborative environments to bring together the resources and the experts who can relate the existing pieces of knowledge to new contexts. It is the synergy created in this kind of environment, which allow producing valuable concepts and ideas in the form of Collective Intelligence. Nevertheless in most existing solutions for collective intelligence or crowdsourcing environments, they do not report the use of a particular methodology to improve the participants' creativity. The solution in this work describes a social network service that enables users to cooperatively solve problems oriented (but not limited) to the phase of conceptual design. In this work we propose that the use of Collective Intelligence in combination with the model TRIZ-CBR could lead the creative efforts in a team to develop innovative solutions. With this work we are looking for connecting experts from one particular field, TRIZ practitioners and stakeholders with the objective to solve problems in collaboration <b>unlashing</b> the collective intelligence to improve creativity. This work uses the basis of the concept named "Open CAI 2. 0 " to propose a solution in the form of a theoretical framework. The contributions seek to move the development of the field in Computer Aided Innovation a step forward...|$|E

60|$|And {{such was}} the strangeness of it, the real now became unreal. The mile tramp and the {{pitching}} of camp by {{the edge of the}} stream seemed like a passage in a nightmare.

60|$|In {{twelve hours}} the sea had almost gone down. The {{floating}} anchor was hauled up and <b>unlashed,</b> the masts were stepped, the large sail hoisted, and, {{free from the}} dead weight that had hitherto checked her speed, the little craft sped along gaily before the gentle wind, Godfrey keeping her as near as possible dead before it, on the chance that they might catch sight of the boat.|$|R
50|$|To {{come out}} from the hove-to {{position}} and get under way again, the tiller or wheel is <b>unlashed</b> and the windward jibsheet is released, hauling in the normal leeward one.

It is important when choosing the tack, heaving to, and remaining hove to, in a confined space that adequate room is allowed for these maneuvers.|$|R
60|$|While {{engaged in}} {{constructing}} the hut, {{he observed that}} the four dogs were sitting on their tails doing nothing except gazing in curiosity, if not surprise, at his unwonted proceedings. Being a busy man, he naturally disliked idlers, and therefore <b>unlashed</b> some food from his sledge and served out their supper by way of giving them something to do. They ceased idling at once, but after supper sat down on their tails again to watch as before, though in a more languid frame of mind.|$|R
60|$|The woman nodded, and Lon fell to unharnessing the dogs, while I <b>unlashed</b> {{the sled}} {{and carried the}} camp outfit into the cabin. The cabin was a large, one-room affair, and the woman was evidently alone in it. She pointed to the stove, where water was already boiling, and Lon set about the {{preparation}} of supper, while I opened the fish-bag and fed the dogs. I looked for Lon to introduce us, and was vexed that he did not, for they were evidently old friends.|$|R

For my mind was busy with other matters, and besides, I was young in years and knew little of woman. It was only on looking back that I came to understand.|$|R
60|$|I {{began the}} climb. But {{they did not}} wait. One by one they <b>unlashed</b> {{themselves}} and followed me up the perilous mast. There was reason for haste, for at any moment the Sparwehr might slip off into deep water. I timed my leap, and made it, landing in the cleft in a scramble and ready {{to lend a hand}} to those who leaped after. It was slow work. We were wet and half freezing in the wind-drive. Besides, the leaps had to be timed to the roll of the hull and the sway of the mast.|$|R
60|$|Flat-hauled on {{the crisp}} breeze, the Arangi closed in rapidly with the land. Jerry {{peered through the}} barbed wire, {{sniffing}} the air, Skipper beside him and giving orders to the mate and helmsman. The heap of trade- boxes was now <b>unlashed,</b> and the boys began opening and shutting them. What gave them particular delight was the ringing of the bell with which each box was equipped and which rang whenever a lid was raised. Their pleasure in the toy-like contrivance was that of children, and each went back {{again and again to}} unlock his own box and make the bell ring.|$|R
60|$|The sail {{was passed}} aft, <b>unlashed</b> from the yard, and spread out, adding {{considerably}} to {{the comfort of}} all those sitting astern; {{and now that the}} ship's guns were booming ahead, and they had become accustomed to the thick curtain of cloud hanging round them, the feeling of uneasiness that the girls had felt was entirely dissipated, and Mr. Atherton had no longer any occasion to use his best efforts to keep up their spirits. All laughed and chatted over their adventure, which, as they said, far exceeded in interest anything they had been promised when they started from the ship. The only drawback, as they all agreed, was the cold, which was indeed really severe.|$|R
50|$|While the {{explosion}} {{was not a}} full force detonation, it blew a 12x8ft hole in her Starboard side and started a large fire on the Stern of the Badger State. The order to abandon ship went out immediately despite the continuing bad weather, which was then lashing the ship with 25 ft waves and 40 knot winds. No sooner had crew <b>unlashed</b> two rubber liferafts the howling winds tore them off {{the deck of the}} ship. Two other rubber liferafts were lowered into the water, only to be overturned and throwing two men into the water.

60|$|A {{few minutes}} of active and ready {{exertion}} succeeded. A light boom was <b>unlashed</b> from the raft, and raised on its end, supporting a little signal, made of the handkerchiefs of the party, which fluttered in the light breeze, at the elevation of some twenty feet above {{the surface of the}} water. After this precaution was observed, they were obliged to await the result in such patience as they could assume. Minute passed after minute, and, at each moment, the form and proportions of the ship became more distinct, until all the mariners of the party declared they could distinguish men on her yards. A cannon would have readily sent its shot from the ship to the raft, and yet no sign betrayed the consciousness of those in the former of the proximity of the latter.|$|R
40|$|The {{transversal}} design implies {{to explore}} “rizomatic” ways to enter upon the design process, nourishing itself of different artistic expressions, {{not only to}} stimulate and <b>unlash</b> the heuristic process, but to found the project´s decisions. In this workshop we encourage the students to understand creative processes from an integrative scope, combining different methods of plastic experimentation, enhanced from digital environment, and different design scales; using digital media as the tool of production and communication. This is an interdisciplinary workshop since it was led by architects, an actress and a literature professor; and it was directed to architecture and visual communication design students. The experience was very exciting, mainly for the students, they responded with enthusiasm to the professors´ proposals. The relationship between teachers was founded in the fact of sharing conceptual basis and pedagogical objectives, and the respect of particular concerns. Interdisciplinary work opens rich possibilities of interchange, knowledge and intellectual growing. [Full paper in Spanish...|$|R
60|$|This {{was done}} {{as quickly as}} possible, though with much difficulty, and the men were <b>unlashed</b> from the sledge and placed within it. The others then crowded in, and, falling down beside each other, were asleep in an instant. The {{excessive}} crowding of the little tent was an advantage at this time, as it tended to increase their animal heat. Captain Guy allowed them to sleep only two hours, and then roused {{them in order to}} continue the journey; but short though the period of rest was, it proved sufficient to enable the men to pursue their journey with some degree of spirit. Still, it was evident that their energies had been overtaxed, for when they neared the ship next day, Tom Singleton, who had been on the lookout, and advanced to meet them, found that they were almost in a state of stupor, and talked incoherently; sometimes giving utterance to sentiments of the most absurd nature, with expressions of the utmost gravity.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{two main}} types of dry cargo: bulk cargo and break bulk cargo. Bulk cargoes, like grain or coal, are transported {{unpackaged}} in the hull of the ship, generally in large volume. Break-bulk cargoes, on the other hand, are transported in packages, and are generally manufactured goods. [...] Before the advent of containerization in the 1950s, break-bulk items were loaded, lashed, <b>unlashed</b> and unloaded from the ship one piece at a time. However, by grouping cargo into containers, [...] of cargo, or up to about 64000 lb, is moved at once and each container is secured to the ship once in a standardized way. [...] Containerization has increased the efficiency of moving traditional break-bulk cargoes significantly, reducing shipping time by 84% and costs by 35%. [...] In 2001, more than 90% of world trade in non-bulk goods was transported in ISO containers. [...] In 2009, almost {{one quarter of the}} world's dry cargo was shipped by container, an estimated 125 million TEU or 1.19 billion metric tons worth of cargo.|$|R
60|$|He <b>unlashed</b> the {{fastenings}} {{of the cover}} of the circular hole above him, reached his hand forward and got hold of Luka's paddle, and passed it with his own out through the hole. Then he sat up himself. Confident as he felt in the canoe, he was almost frightened at the wild aspect of the sea. The wind was literally howling, driving the rain before it with a force that stung Godfrey's neck as it struck it. He got out a strip of deer-skin lashing, of which there was a supply always close at hand under the deck, lashed the paddles together, and then, leaning aft, lashed them at the centre firmly to the tow-rope. Then with some difficulty he got out his knife and cut the rope close to its fastening; the paddles flew overboard, and the boat drifted rapidly astern, the drag of the paddles being, as Godfrey observed with satisfaction, sufficient to keep her head to wind. Then he wriggled himself down underneath the apron again and lashed down {{the cover of the}} hole.|$|R
40|$|This article {{deals with}} the servant of God Maria Caterina Brondi (Sarzana, 1684 -Pisa, 1719), also known by the time as the santina de Sarzana. She begins her road to {{perfection}} in her hometown under the auspicies of the Jesuits who are touring the Italian lands deploying the popular missions and then she pursues it under the spiritual direction {{of a number of}} ecclesiastics in towns belonging to the Republic of Genoa and to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. Her experiences arouses the interest of the Grand-Duke Cosimo III and his daugther Anna Maria Luisa de Medici. Her characteristics as a female mystic together with the doubting reaction from church authorities she received rank her in the company of Saints Catherine of Siena, Teresa of Jesus and her contemporary Veronica Giuliani. The study sheds new light to the forms of lay spirituality, ecclesiastical surveilance and the active involvement from no less high a political official than the GrandDuke of Tuscany, who places her under his protection and patronage. Her death <b>unlashes</b> polemics and the cause of her beatification seems to have left unfinished.  </p...|$|R
50|$|There {{was a small}} bark on the island, a boat {{built to}} carry beef back to Guam, which could perhaps hold 30 men and so in its present state was clearly inadequate. Not wishing to go to Guam where they would rot in prison, or worse, {{it was decided to}} {{lengthen}} and refit the bark and attempt the 2200 mi voyage to Macau. As work progressed, there were mounting concerns about the ability to fit all aboard, the lack of provisions that would keep on a long voyage and the lack of navigational instruments. Many privately expressed a preference to remain on the island preferring a secure, if lonely, existence to the prospect of perishing at sea. To everyone's astonishment, the Centurion reappeared after 19 days causing even Anson to show emotion. The crew had battled heroically to keep her afloat contending with <b>unlashed</b> cannons rolling about, open gun ports allowing the ocean to surge in, the anchor dangling below and only having the mizen mast rigged, all the while dealing with the original leak in the hull. Gradually control was regained and the ship was able to sail upwind to regain Tinian.|$|R
60|$|In the {{afternoon}} {{a fleet of}} galleys was seen coming down the river. The Danes possessed {{a large number of}} these boats at Yarmouth, and in these they navigated the inland waters far into the interior. The wind had shifted until it was blowing nearly due east, and Edmund and Egbert had agreed upon the best course to be pursued. In case of attack they could hardly hope finally to beat off the assault of a large fleet of galleys, and would besides be exposed to attack by boats laden with combustibles. Therefore as soon as the galleys were seen approaching the oars were <b>unlashed,</b> the great sail hoisted, and at her best speed the Dragon advanced up the river to meet her foes. The Danes gave a shout of alarm as the vessel advanced to meet them with the water surging in a white wave from her bows, and the greater part of them hurried towards one bank or the other to escape the shock. Some, slower in movement or stouter in heart, awaited the attack, while from all a storm of missiles was poured upon the advancing boat.|$|R
60|$|It {{makes me}} sigh now {{to think of}} the cheer which burst from that tatterdemalion crew. Who were they to fight the bone and sinew of the King's navy in a rotten ship of an age gone by? And who was he, that stood so {{straight}} upon the quarter-deck, to instil this scum with love and worship and fervour to blind them to such odds? But the bo'suns piped and sang out the command in fog-horn voices, the drums beat the long roll and the fifes whistled, and the decks became suddenly alive. Breechings were loosed and gun-tackles <b>unlashed,</b> rammer and sponge laid out, and pike and pistol and cutlass placed where they would be handy when the time came to rush the enemy's decks. The powder-monkeys tumbled over each other in their hurry to provide cartridges, and grape and canister and doubleheaded shot were hoisted up from below. The trimmers rigged the splinter nettings, got out spare spars and blocks and ropes against those that were sure to be shot away, and rolled up casks of water to put out the fires. Tubs were filled with sand, for blood is slippery upon the boards. The French marines, their scarlet and white very natty in contrast to most of our ragged wharf-rats at the guns, were mustered on poop and forecastle, and some were sent aloft to the tops to assist the tars there to sweep the British decks with handgrenade and musket. And, lastly, the surgeon and his mates went below to cockpit and steerage, to make ready for the grimmest work of all.|$|R
