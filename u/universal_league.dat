25|$|Lawrence Mee was {{to breathe}} {{new life into}} the <b>Universal</b> <b>League.</b> In 1973 Mee and his wife became {{co-workers}} at the head office of the World Esperanto Organization. The following year the <b>Universal</b> <b>League</b> selected a few faithful members to lead a renewal of the League in striving for peace through cooperation with the World Association for World Federation (now known as the World Federalist Movement) and the World Esperanto Association.|$|E
25|$|During the 1950s {{membership}} in the <b>Universal</b> <b>League</b> grew to 15,000 Esperantists. In 1959, they realized the longstanding dream of minting Esperanto coinage in denominations of one Stelo (bronze), five Steloj (yellow copper) and ten Steloj (cupronickel). Rich from worldwide commodity sales receipts, the <b>Universal</b> <b>League</b> had placed a large order for with the Royal Dutch Mint (Rijksmunt) in Utrecht to strike the coinage. This investment was swiftly recouped, {{with the result that}} in 1965 the League was able to issue a fourth denomination, a silver 25-Steloj coin, which also sold very well.|$|E
25|$|Later {{development}} of the Stelo stagnated. The <b>Universal</b> <b>League</b> founders wanted to show their good will by maintaining a constant value for the Stelo, but their efforts were doomed to failure. The Dutch price of bread gradually increased, but nobody thought to adjust {{the relationship between the}} Stelo and the guilder. The ratio remained four Steloj to the guilder, and bank currency conversion tables were used to fix the value of the Stelo in other countries. Moreover, even the <b>Universal</b> <b>League</b> gave up the idea of recording bookkeeping transactions in Stelo monetary units, so nobody gained experience with a coin of constant value. It is no wonder that the Stelo lost its reputation and that its use even by Esperantists became rare.|$|E
50|$|Townshend {{obtained}} {{rooms at}} 18 Greek Street {{to use as}} the <b>Universal</b> <b>League's</b> headquarters. They were also used {{as the home of}} the International Working Men's Association a few months later.|$|R
5000|$|Akron Cougars (joined the <b>Universal</b> Basketball <b>League.</b> The league folded {{before the}} first season.) ...|$|R
50|$|The team {{announced}} {{that they would be}} relocating to Akron, Ohio for the 2007 season, replacing the previously announced Akron Quakers. Soon after, the team announced a move to the <b>Universal</b> Basketball <b>League.</b> However, given the state of the <b>Universal</b> Basketball <b>League</b> today, and given the recent announcement of the Akron Energy, a new IBL team headed by Marc Cook, it appears as though the Cougars are defunct.|$|R
25|$|Mee {{worked out}} the {{unofficial}} value of the Stelo in those 25 countries, using as his point of departure 1 January 1977, the day on which the Stelo's fixed purchasing power was defined. He discovered that the <b>Universal</b> <b>League</b> formula was certainly wrong for the Netherlands; he presumed {{that it was wrong}} for other countries also, although he did not yet have proof of this.|$|E
25|$|The {{archives}} of the <b>Universal</b> <b>League</b> show that the intention was to mint a coin with a fixed value. The League saw this stability {{as the only way}} to lift the world from the pressures of economic differentials that tended to result in conflicts among peoples. Exchange rates for the Stelo outside the Netherlands were based on 1946 exchange rates for other currencies quoted by the largest Dutch commercial bank.|$|E
25|$|With bank {{accounts}} in seven countries including the Netherlands, the <b>Universal</b> <b>League</b> needed to stipulate {{the value of}} the Stelo in these countries. For want of scientific data on the effective purchasing power of the various national currencies it was, however, impossible to determine reliable conversion rates between the Stelo and each national currency. While the conversion rate with the guilder was solidly established, agreement on the other rates would not be easy.|$|E
50|$|The Akron Cougars are a {{professional}} men's minor league basketball team, {{members of the}} upstart <b>Universal</b> Basketball <b>League,</b> based in Akron, Ohio.|$|R
25|$|Lawrence Mee enthusiastically {{accepted}} {{the position of}} League treasurer in 1977. Remaining as board members were Christiaan M.N.T. Op 't Roodt and Willem P. Roelofs, who were eager to quickly establish a procedure to keep the Stelo's value constant and to publish the result {{within the framework of}} the Esperanto movement. Under the editorship of Op 't Roodt, the <b>Universal</b> <b>League's</b> new periodical Bulteno was guided by the idea that the value of the Stelo would remain constant, unaffected by inflation.|$|R
50|$|Happy Birthday is a {{collaboration}} album by Pete Townshend, the guitarist for The Who and friends, including Ronnie Lane. It was pressed and released in 1970 by <b>Universal</b> Spiritual <b>League.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1993 the {{governing}} board of the <b>Universal</b> <b>League</b> ceased publishing the Bulteno and decided to wind up {{the affairs of the}} League itself. The remaining capital was divided among several foundations, with most of the funds going to the World Esperanto Association. Among the grants was found a stock of Stelo coins to be sold through the UEA as collector's items. The death of Dr. Op 't Roodt in 1996 and of Dr. Roelofs in 1998 marked the end of a major Esperantist initiative.|$|E
25|$|But {{the other}} {{dream of the}} Stelo {{retaining}} a constant value was almost forgotten except among the very old <b>Universal</b> <b>League</b> members. The League fell quiet and scarcely did anything, though still publishing the illustrated magazine La Praktiko. The new subtitle was A journal for citizens of the world; previously it had been A journal for instruction and recreation. Publication of the periodical stopped only in 1970, when Andreo Cseh, who had been editor since 1946, had to retire due to weak health. Dr. Cseh remained in a care home {{until his death in}} 1979.|$|E
25|$|Even in {{the early}} period (1945) the <b>Universal</b> <b>League</b> {{nevertheless}} brought out the 1-Stelo Premio-Kupono, which remained valid till 1950. Every new coupon issue brought on the market {{was intended to be}} valid for five years. The coupons were used to pay for subscriptions, advertisements, activity participation costs, etc. League members also received the coupons as rewards for introducing new members or as competition prizes. According to a report in La Praktiko the use of Premio-Kupono flourished, and it became habitual for Esperantists to pay with them, for example during Esperanto world conferences.|$|E
50|$|During the First World War he {{organized}} the Sydney Chamber of Commerce War Food Fund, helped {{to establish the}} State Wool Committee, founded the <b>Universal</b> Service <b>League</b> (1915). He was a trustee of the Regimental Comforts Fund and vice-president of the Soldiers' Club (1915).|$|R
50|$|In 1915 {{he founded}} the Soldiers Help Society. He also {{travelled}} Queensland as honorary organising secretary of the Queensland Recruiting Committee, preaching to encourage greater enlistment. He was an ardent supporter of conscription, co-founded the Compulsory Service League, served on the Executive of the National Council for the Referendum {{and founder of the}} <b>Universal</b> Service <b>League.</b>|$|R

2500|$|After discussion, the Esperantists {{agreed to}} form the <b>Universal</b> <b>League</b> as an {{organization}} whose principal purpose would be to implement Zamenhof's original program: to unite humanity in peace through a common language. Employing the motto [...] "One World, One Language, One Currency," [...] the Netherlands-based group promoted {{the use of the}} Stelo as a universal currency unit.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Universal</b> <b>League</b> {{remained}} in existence, {{but in the}} Esperanto world its significance declined. After they had placed his obituary in the periodical Esperanto, {{many of his colleagues}} died as well. Dr. Roelofs had taken over the editing of the Bulteno [...] when Dr. Op 't Roodt could no longer undertake it. The irregular appearance of new issues of the [...] Bulteno made apparent the reduction in active League membership.|$|E
50|$|A {{supporter}} of conscription in World War I, Fern joined the <b>Universal</b> Service <b>League</b> in 1915. He {{served as a}} member of the 17th and 16th Battalions of the Australian Imperial Force from 1915 to 1916, attaining the rank of Lance Corporal. He suffered from shellshock as a result of his service and was invalided home. He died at Lidcombe in 1918.|$|R
50|$|During the First World War, Hughes and {{his wife}} were a {{foundation}} executive-members of the <b>Universal</b> Service <b>League</b> and were part {{of a small group of}} upper-class Catholics who opposed the anti-conscription stance of the Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne Daniel Mannix and other Catholics. Although he remained a firm opponent of the influence of sectarianism and its position in society at that time.|$|R
50|$|Prime Minister Billy Hughes {{hosted a}} {{referendum}} on 28 October 1916. His campaign for conscription {{was supported by the}} major newspaper companies and other media. It was also supported by most of the Commonwealth Liberal Party including the Liberal state premiers, by the major Protestant churches and the <b>Universal</b> Service <b>League,</b> which had many prominent Australians as members. The result was that there were 1,087,557 votes in favour and 1,160,033 in opposition. The failed referendum led to Prime Minister Billy Hughes losing his seat in the Australian Labor Party.|$|R
2500|$|The 1946 {{assembly}} re-emphasized {{the motto}} [...] "One World, One Language, One Currency." [...] The League had commercial relations with banks in six countries (Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Sweden and Switzerland), {{as well as}} with three Dutch banks. For all these bank accounts the <b>Universal</b> <b>League</b> maintained parallel systematic accounting in the local currency and in Steloj, and appointed agents in 14 other countries. These representatives submitted their financial operations reports {{on the basis of the}} Stelo.|$|E
2500|$|For {{two years}} they {{promoted}} {{development of the}} Stelo as an international currency. After long discussion they concluded that the Stelo should be revalued from a fourth of a guilder to a half-guilder. Further discussions led the <b>Universal</b> <b>League</b> to fix {{the value of the}} Stelo. Mee was later to write a significant and comprehensive essay {{on the development of the}} Stelo, [...] ("The stable monetary unit of the Esperantists: the Stelo'"), which first appeared in the 2000 Yearbook of Europees Genootschap voor Munt- en Penningkunde, a federation of Dutch-language numismatic associations.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{founding}} of the <b>Universal</b> <b>League,</b> an express wish of the now-deceased Zamenhof and of Esperantists from many different lands both before and during the Second World War was coming to fruition. The original participants secretly invited other well-known Esperantists {{to take part in the}} discussions. A preparatory committee was constituted to develop and fix the ideas further. On 1 April 1945 the committee revealed their basic concept to the world. One of their stated purposes was: [...] "to strive for the creation of a world currency, based on an international monetary unit, the Stelo." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{students}} of WISD were continuing to play competitive {{sports in the}} 1940 gymnasium. <b>Universal</b> Interscholastic <b>League</b> had noted on several occasions the floor was not regulation size. WISD began saving funds {{in order to build}} a new facility. Once again, using $462,731.76 of local funds and the DSA Construction Mgr., construction began on the west end of the cafeteria. (Wortham ISD Board minutes, November 16, 1993.) The new gymnasium was completed in 1994. The original building is presently being used for P.E. classes, Little Dribbler basketball games and Wortham Ex-Student activities.|$|R

50|$|Almost {{from the}} start of {{elections}} in Japan, popular movements arose to eliminate the tax-paying requirement, which effectively disenfranchised {{a large segment of the}} adult male population. In 1897, the <b>Universal</b> Suffrage <b>League</b> (Futsu Senkyo Kisei Dōmeikai) was created to raise public awareness through discussion groups and periodicals. Diet members, mostly from liberal faction within the Diet, supported by the Liberal Party of Japan (Jiyuto) and its offshoots, presented bills to the Diet in 1902, 1903, 1908, 1909 and 1910. The movement finally appeared to succeed in March 1911, when its Universal Suffrage Bill was passed by the lower house only to be summarily rejected by the House of Peers.|$|R
2500|$|Dr. Roelofs {{especially}} {{wanted to}} give the Stelo a character totally different from Dr. Hartl's idea of international monetary units. He also advocated using the Stelo as propaganda for money reform. Dr. Roelofs believed that the Stelo should {{serve as the basis for}} international financial transactions, but only between countries that refused to deal with commercial banks. How the system would function was never detailed on paper, writes Lawrence Mee, [...] "presumably because the ideas of money reformers were already well known." [...] Although he admitted that the original basis of the purchasing-power provision was somewhat arbitrary, Mee wanted the Stelo to serve in the role originally envisioned by the <b>Universal</b> <b>League.</b>|$|E
2500|$|For Lawrence Mee {{the ideas}} of Dr. Hartl were not dead. [...] He {{and his wife had}} long used the Stelo in the {{bookkeeping}} for their business Mondkomercista Eldonejo Esperantista (an Esperanto-language trade publisher). After his departure from the <b>Universal</b> <b>League</b> he tried to apply Dr. Roelofs's currency values, but quickly concluded that the data on the purchasing power of the Stelo were erroneous. From the mid-1980s he began to collect statistical data on inflation in various countries, gaining the unexpected support of an economics instructor at Erasmus University in Rotterdam. The instructor had a great interest in Mee's work. An honorary member of the library at Erasmus University, Mee occupied much of his free time in researching statistical data on the 25 countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.|$|E

5000|$|Boissel came to {{be heavily}} {{influenced}} by the ethno-racialist concepts of Arthur de Gobineau. He became active in political journalism and, in 1933, he published a book titled Les Croix le sang (The Cross of Blood). In 1934, he undertook the founding of a far-right league called Racisme International Fascism, later renamed Le Front Franc. Starting in March 1936, Boissel founded the Paris-based periodical Le Réveil du peuple, which he edited as an organ of the Front. [...] Boissel established contacts {{with the leaders of}} the German Nazi Party. In May 1935, he went to Nuremberg to participate in the congress of the <b>Universal</b> Anti-Jewish <b>League</b> (La Ligue Antijuive Universelle) alongside Julius Streicher.|$|R
50|$|By May 1916 the Queensland Recruiting Committee had {{instituted a}} {{centralised}} and cross-referenced filing system. This filing system provided the Committee with detailed records of 120,000 eligible males in Queensland {{and used a}} classification system to show availability in terms of family responsibilities, work commitments and other factors. This elaborate and detailed organisation was informed as much by the expectation of conscription as it was by the ongoing campaign for voluntary enlistment. Recruiting organisers increasingly believed that the voluntary system had reached its limit and invested {{in the success of}} compulsory conscription which had been publicly advocated by the <b>Universal</b> Service <b>League</b> and others since September 1915. The government under William Morris Hughes offered a plebiscite on the issue of conscription - campaigning for which proved highly socially and politically divisive. This debate helped to shatter any illusion of national unanimity around the war issue. The plebiscite was narrowly defeated on 28 October 1916. A second plebiscite in December 1917 was also defeated. Campaigning prior to the second vote proved even more vitriolic and divisive than the first. In the wake of these setbacks, recruiting organisers pulled out all stops to meet the quotas demanded by the government.|$|R
50|$|Susan Louise Cotton Marsh {{was born}} on April 23, 1867 in Troy, Indiana. She was the {{daughter}} of Cullen Columbus Cotton & Ann Connot. She later moved to Monet, Missouri where she married Eugene Marsh. The couple had two children, Eugenia and Wilbur, after they moved to Webster Groves, Missouri. Here, Marsh began her career of advocacy. Marsh was heavily involved {{as a member of the}} Webster Groves chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. She also advocated for the American Red Cross and the Navy League during World War 1. Other clubs she was a part of include, the Monday Club of Webster Groves, the Shakespeare Drama Study Club and Tercentenary Club, the American Literary League, the St. Louis Dante Club, the Daughters of 1812, the Colonial Dames of the 17th Century, Snider Association of <b>Universal</b> Culture, the <b>League</b> of Women Voters, the Republican Women's Club, the London Poetical Society and the National Society Magna Charta Dames. Marsh even began the St. Louis Branch of the National League of American Pen-Women. Her heavy involvement as an activist then led her into the political arena.|$|R
