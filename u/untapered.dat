25|$|The {{aircraft}} has {{an unusual}} configuration with a fully glazed forward cabin, reminiscent of an Alouette helicopter, that provides 270° panoramic vision and almost vertical downward {{vision for the}} pilot and two passengers. The aircraft has twin booms with twin rudders and a high-mounted tailplane. It {{is powered by a}} Lycoming flat-six normally-aspirated engine situated behind the cabin and driving a fixed pitch ducted fan. Due to the ducted fan, the aircraft is exceptionally quiet. The aircraft has a fixed tricycle undercarriage with the nosewheel offset to the left. The wings are unswept and <b>untapered.</b> The aircraft is of fairly standard all-metal construction with stressed skin of aluminium.|$|E
25|$|A few knots {{have become}} more or less {{standard}} for attaching the {{various parts of the}} fly lines and backing, etc., together. A detailed discussion of most of these knots is available in any good book on fly fishing. Some of the knots that are in most every fly angler's arsenal are: the improved clinch knot which is commonly used to attach the fly to the leader, the overhand slip knot or arbor knot which is used to attach the backing to the spool, the albright knot which can be used to attach the fly line to the backing. A loop can also be put in fly line backing using a bimini twist. Often, a loop is added to the business end of the fly line to facilitate the connection to the leader. This loop may take one of several forms. It may be formed by creating a loop in the end of the fly line itself or by adding a braided loop or a loop of monofilament nylon (as in Gray's Loop). Alternatively, a single length of monofilament nylon, or fluorocarbon, may be tied {{to the end of the}} fly line using a nail or tube knot or a needle knot. A loop can then be tied at the end of this monofilament butt length or butt section using a double surgeon's knot or a perfection loop, to which the tapered or <b>untapered</b> leader, also looped using a double surgeon's knot or a perfection loop, may in turn be connected via a loop to loop connection. The use of loop to loop connections between the fly line and the leader provides a quick and convenient way to change or replace a tapered leader. Many commercially produced tapered leaders come with a pre-tied loop connection.|$|E
2500|$|Chain stays may be {{designed}} using tapered or <b>untapered</b> tubing. [...] They may be relieved, ovalized, crimped, S-shaped, or elevated to allow additional clearance for the rear wheel, chain, crankarms, or {{the heel of}} the foot.|$|E
2500|$|The {{new design}} was {{initially}} {{known as the}} VCP-2, but was soon resignated as PW-1 (Pursuit, Water-Cooled) in the U.S. Army Air Service's new designation system. The first aircraft was used for static testing, while the second prototype flew in November 1921, reaching a speed of [...] It was rebuilt later that year with a new <b>untapered</b> set of wings using a Fokker style thick airfoil, becoming the PW-1A, but performance was reduced, and the aircraft was refitted with its original wings, reverting to the designation PW-1.|$|E
2500|$|The wing was of NACA 23018 {{section at}} the root, {{and was a}} five-piece, all-metal, {{twin-spar}} structure. The <b>untapered</b> centre section carried the inboard engines and main undercarriage, while {{the inner and outer}} sections were tapered on their leading and trailing edges, with the inner sections carrying the outboard engines. The ailerons were fitted with trim and balance tabs, and there were hydraulically operated split flaps in three sections {{on each side of the}} trailing edges of the centre section and inner wings. A [...] fuel capacity was given by eight bag tanks, one on either side of the fuselage in the centre section and three in both inner wings.|$|E
2500|$|The wings {{were built}} around two spars. The central 25% of their span, between the booms, had {{constant}} chord. [...] Immediately outboard {{they had a}} wider chord and beyond were double straight tapered to rounded tips. They carried [...] almost full span, narrow chord Frise ailerons. Forward, the slim, square section and <b>untapered</b> tail booms blended into the wings at about mid-chord, the aft ends carrying a constant chord tailplane slightly above them. [...] This had rounded tips and a central elevator with a trim tab. [...] A central, single, tall, round tipped, wire braced vertical tail was mounted on in it. The H.110 had a fixed, split, conventional undercarriage with each spatted mainwheel on a faired, near vertical shock absorber and a rearward leaning strut together forming a V, laterally braced with an inverted V-strut attached near the under fuselage centre line. [...] There was a central tailwheel on a long leg under the fin.|$|E
6000|$|... § IX. It is {{necessary}} to limit this observation to European architecture, because the Egyptian shaft is often <b>untapered,</b> like the Northern. It appears that the Central Southern, or Greek shaft, was tapered or curved on æsthetic rather than constructive principles; and the Egyptian which precedes, and the Northern which follows it, are both vertical, the one because the best form had not been discovered, the other because {{it could not be}} attained. Both are in a certain degree barbaric; and both possess in combination and in their ornaments a power altogether {{different from that of the}} Greek shaft, and at least as impressive if not as admirable.|$|E

5000|$|Space {{elevator}} equations typically use a [...] "characteristic length", Lc, {{which is}} also known as its [...] "self-support length" [...] and is the length of <b>untapered</b> cable it can support in a constant 1 g gravity field.|$|E
50|$|For {{rotating}} tethers (rotovators) {{the value}} used is the material’s ‘characteristic velocity’ {{which is the}} maximum tip velocity a rotating <b>untapered</b> cable can attain without breaking,The characteristic velocity equals the specific velocity multiplied by the square root of two.|$|E
50|$|SHARAD (Mars SHAllow RADar sounder) is a {{subsurface}} sounding radar {{embarked on}} the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter probe. It complements the MARSIS instrument on Mars Express, providing lower penetration capabilities (some hundred meters) but much finer resolution (15 metres - <b>untapered</b> - in free space).|$|E

5000|$|Bristles may {{be natural}} or synthetic. If the {{filaments}} are synthetic, {{they may be}} made of polyester, nylon or a blend of nylon and polyester.Filaments can be hollow or solid and can be [...] or <b>untapered.</b> Brushes with tapered filaments give a smoother finish.|$|E
50|$|Anacropora spinosa forms bushy {{clumps of}} contorted {{branches}} up to 10 mm thick which taper to a point. The corallites are long, crowded and irregular, mostly being <b>untapered.</b> Spines project beneath the corallites. The colour of this coral is usually brownish, and {{the tips of}} the branches are often white.|$|E
50|$|The {{ratio of}} tip chord to root chord {{is called the}} taper ratio. Taper has the {{desirable}} effect of reducing the root bending stress by shifting the lift inboard, {{but it has been}} argued by some noted designers, including John Thorp and Karl Bergey, that an <b>untapered</b> rectangular planform is best for aeroplanes of less than 6,000 pounds gross weight.|$|E
50|$|The Fw 44 was {{designed}} as a biplane with conventional layout and straight, <b>untapered</b> wings. Its two open cockpits were arranged in tandem, and both cockpits were equipped with flight controls and instruments. The Fw 44 had fixed tailwheel landing gear. It employed ailerons on both upper and lower wings. It did not use flaps. It was flown with a Siemens-Halske Sh 14 radial engine.|$|E
50|$|The {{parasol wing}} of the 490 was of straight, <b>untapered</b> plan apart from {{elliptical}} tips. For its time the all-metal wing was thin, with a thickness/chord ratio of 8.5%, and was built up around two spars. The ailerons were split into two pairs. Streamlined lift struts ran from the lower fuselage longerons to about mid-span, assisted by two pairs of outward leaning centre section struts.|$|E
50|$|The Keystone XLB-6 {{prototype}} {{was created}} by refitting the final triple-tailed Keystone LB-5 (serial number 27-344) with an LB-5A tail unit; longer (75 foot) straight-chord, <b>untapered</b> and noticeably swept-back wings; and 525 hp (391 kW) Wright Cyclone R-1750-1 radial engines suspended on struts between the wings rather than mounted on the lower wing. This produced a bomber with {{twice the rate of}} climb as the LB-5 and slightly faster cruise speed. Production LB-6s featured a five-foot longer fuselage.|$|E
5000|$|Lacome's [...]58 caliber {{percussion}} lock prairie rifle {{is displayed}} in the Palace of the Governors museum in Santa Fe, where he is listed as a trader with the Zuni and Navajo. It is a Hawken style with a snail breech and double set trigger in a scroll guard. The [...]58 caliber <b>untapered</b> barrel is 36" [...] x 1-1/8" [...] and the rifle is approximately 53" [...] in overall length with a 13-5/8" [...] length of pull.|$|E
50|$|The cable {{would need}} to be made of a {{material}} with a large tensile strength/density ratio. For example, the Edwards space elevator design assumes a cable material with a specific strength of at least 100,000 kN/(kg/m). This value takes into consideration the entire weight of the space elevator. An <b>untapered</b> space elevator cable would need a material capable of sustaining a length of 4,960 km of its own weight at sea level to reach a geostationary altitude of 35786 km without yielding. Therefore, a material with very high strength and lightness is needed.|$|E
50|$|The next problem {{encountered}} by Kilbourn {{was that the}} gun cradle, the metal block on which the gun sat, had to be shortened to allow the gun {{to fit into the}} Firefly, and thus the gun itself was not very stable. Kilbourn had a new barrel designed for the 17-pounder that had a longer <b>untapered</b> section at the base, which helped solve the stability problem. A new mantlet was designed to house this gun and accept the modified cradle. The modifications were extensive enough that 17-pounders intended for the Firefly had to be factory-built specifically for it.|$|E
50|$|The primary wing {{structure}} is a wood box spar connected to an aileron spar by ribs cut on a band saw. To {{the front of}} the main spar are strapped D-shaped fiberglass fuel tanks which can carry up to 12 imperial gallons per wing. Over the tanks is the framing and plywood skin of the wing's nose. Behind the main spar, the wings are covered in cloth. The wing section is the NACA 23012 with a 55 in chord; the wing is rectangular, being straight and <b>untapered.</b> No flaps were fitted to the prototype, but they were being considered.|$|E

50|$|The {{wings of}} the SB-11 have 2.3° of {{dihedral}} and are unswept. The inner 60% of span has constant chord. The outer panels, carrying the ailerons, are straight tapered with a taper ratio of 0.4. Manually driven full span Fowler type Wortmann flaps emerge from the trailing edge between rollers, increasing the chord by 200 mm (7.9 in) over the <b>untapered</b> inner wing and by 80 mm (3.2 in) at the tip. Overall the flaps produce a 25% increase in wing area. Their trailing edges carry ailerons outboard and plain camber changing flaps inboard. Above wing, mid-chord Schempp-Hirth airbrakes are placed at about mid span.|$|E

50|$|In April 1919, General Duval of the French Armée de l'Air {{set out for}} the {{replacement}} of two of the principal categories of aircraft within the air force - CAP2 (Chasse, Armée, Biplace meaning 'armed two-seat fighter') and CAN2 (Chasse, Armée, Nuit, Biplace meaning 'armed two-seat night fighter'). Gourdou-Leseurre put forward the GL-50 as a submission for the CAP2 category (despite the fact that this categorisation system was removed in 1920). Its 300 hp Hispano-Suiza engine was intended to be fitted with a supercharger, however this was not fitted, despite the fact it would have increased its performance drastically. It was of wooden construction, with a long-span <b>untapered</b> wing, considered unusual at the time, that feature being more in line with single-seat aircraft design, as were the wing bracing struts.|$|E
