The {{aim of this study}} was to assess factors influencing the quality of raw sludge, i. e. freshly-produced and non-treated sludge. The survey of raw sludge quality was conducted each season over a year with controlled factors such as sludge type (primary or biological; rural or urban area origin) and seasonal evolution. Quality of raw sludge was characterized by the determination of microbiological (Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli, enterococci, spores of Clostridium perfringens) and chemical parameters (metallic trace elements, organic index). The organic index is a new parameter based on a gas chromatography method and developed in this study in order to estimate global organic semi-volatile load in sludge. Results showed significant differences in raw sludge quality depending on controlled factors. Thus, E. coli, and enterococci concentrations were higher in primary and biological <b>urban</b> raw <b>sludge</b> compared to biological rural sludge.

Piggery, malting production and <b>urban</b> <b>sludges</b> derived from full-scale anaerobic reactors were tested in the experiment {{as the source of}} inoculum in batch digesters. It was found that piggery sludge was the most affected by the increase of ammonia nitrogen concentration while malting producing and municipal sludges were less affected. In general, the addition of zeolite at doses in the range of 0. 01 – 0. 1 g/g VSS reduced the inhibitory effect of N-NH 4 + for piggery sludge (P. S.). For this sludge, the propionic:acetic ratio increased when the concentration of N-NH 4 + increased, indicating that methanogenesis was affected.

40|$|Urbanization is unrelenting due {{to rapid}} world {{population}} growth, necessitating a sustainable assessment with consideration of environmental impact to minimize resources inputs and waste outputs. An eco-efficiency analysis (EEA) framework {{has been developed}} to evaluate <b>urban</b> <b>sludge</b> handling options. Assessment of economic cost and environmental impact has revealed the suitability of the framework in urban application, as demonstrated by a case-study assessment of five sewage sludge management scenarios in Hong Kong. Land cost considerations, which are trivial in rural areas, have been revealed to be crucial in urban cities by the recognition of consequential sensitivity to high urban land costs. Furthermore, separate and detailed assessment of sludge treatment facilities based on actual transportation data are also highly significant because the accumulated GHG emissions associated with transportation can vary up to 187, 000 tons when using single transportation distance assumptions. By the inclusive evaluation of sludge scenarios instead of individual treatment technology, comprehensive and informative results were obtained for sustainable town planning and sludge management.

Both herbicides and metabolites were monitored during long-term laboratory incubation (140 days) and analyzed by gas chromatography with a nitrogen−phosphorus detector (GC-NPD). Residues were confirmed by gas chromatography with a mass selective detector (GC-MSD). A sonication microextraction method was used to extract the compounds. The organic amendments used were <b>urban</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> and the humic fraction of this sludge, to increase the organic matter content of the soil from 1 % to 2 %. For both compounds, simazine and terbuthylazine, the degradation began earlier in the amended soils.

40|$|The {{majority}} of pollutants that affect wastewater are concentrated by treatment processes in sludge; {{it is therefore}} critical to have a suitable evaluation methodology of sludge management options to analyze if pollution is redirected from water to other media, such as air and soil. Life cycle assessment {{is one of the}} most widely known and internationally accepted methodologies to compare environmental impacts of processes and systems and to evaluate their sustainability in the entire life cycle. In this study the methodology was applied to assess and compare three scenarios of <b>urban</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> treatment and disposal: sludge anaerobic digestion followed by dedicated incineration, sludge incineration without previous digestion, and sludge anaerobic digestion followed by composting. The potential benefits of spreading the compost to soil were not included in the system boundaries even if, due to its nutrients contents and soil improving features, compost could partially replace the use of commercial products. The study was aimed at finding out the environmental critical points of the treatment alternatives selected and at providing a technical and scientific contribution for further debates with national and local authorities on the environmental optimization of sewage sludge management. Life cycle assessment results confirmed the major contribution of electricity and methane consumption on several environmental impact categories.

Mineral fertilization ensured a yield increase of 8 %, while manure fertilization led to yield increases of 18 - 35 % (depending on rate), while the sludge fertilization to 13 - 46 %. The organic fertilization led to the soil content increase in organic carbon, total nitrogen, mobile phosphorus and potassium. The paper presents data regarding the content of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium and heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Pb, Co, Ni, Mn and Cd) in stems, leaves and grains of oats.

The following experimental scheme with plantingpots was used: A factor = depth of planting substrate for applying the organic matter on it, with twograduations: a 1 = 0 - 30 cm; a 2 = 0 - 60 cm; B factor = type and amount of organic matter applied (g/lsubstrate), with the following graduations: b 1 = 0; b 2 = manure 340 g/l; b 3 = sludge 170 g/l; b 4 = sludge 340 g/l; b 5 = sludge 510 g/l; b 6 = sludge 680 g/l. Therefore, it was a bi-factorial experiment like 2 x 6, designed assubdivided blocks, with 4 replications. Each planting pot consists in a concrete cylinder of 1 m height anddiameter, and 0. 785 m 3 volume. To sum up the effects of the experimental factors on the trees response, thefollowing readings were recorded: dynamics of trunk diameter growth, length growth of annual shoots,number of flower buds/tree and fluorescence. In the first year after planting, the depth of the plantingsubstrate did not significantly influence the annual increase in the trunk cross sectional area (TCSA). Nevertheless, {{in the case of a}} 1 = (0 – 30 cm) substrate, the total annual shoot growth per tree wassignificantly higher by 113 % versus a 2 = (0 – 60 cm). Manure application as 340 g/l substrate versus theunfertilized control influenced by far the annual increase in TCSA (167 %) and of total annual growth(182 %). <b>Urban</b> <b>sludge</b> application (170 - 680 g/l substrate) versus the unfertilized substrate led to asignificantly higher increase (140 - 155 %) in TCSA. The total annual shoot growth showed also higher values(141 - 184 %) in the case of more than 340 g/l sludge application (b 4 – b 6) versus the unfertilized control. Thesame rate of manure (340 g/l) determined a significant increase in total annual growths by 129 % vs. sludgeapplication, but did not significantly influence the TCSA...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to show the results of the Italian {{research}} project of national interest (PRIN) launched in 2006 and finished in 2008, concerning the "assessment of groundwater contamination risk by nitrates assessment". The project verified the IPNOA method for nitrate groundwater contamination risk assessment in four test-sites of Italy. The IPNOA is a parametric index which assesses the potential hazard of nitrate contamination originating from agriculture on a regional scale. The method integrates two categories of parameters: the hazard factors (HF), which represent all farming activities that cause, or might cause, an impact on soil quality in terms of nitrate (use of fertilisers, application of livestock and poultry manure, food industry wastewater and <b>urban</b> <b>sludge),</b> and the control factors (CF) which adapt the hazard factors to the characteristics of the site (geographical location, climatic conditions and agronomic practices). Finally, the Potential Risk Map is obtained by coupling the potential hazard of nitrate pollution (IPNOA) and the aquifer Contamination Vulnerability Map. The project was carried out by five Research Units (RU) from the Politecnico di Torino, Universities of Piacenza, Florence, Naples and Palermo. The geochemistry of groundwaters from the four test-sites was studied to determine the distribution of nitrate, and to evaluate groundwater chemical facies. All the study areas are affected by groundwater nitrate contamination and often by hydrogeochemical peculiarities. In some cases isotopic study, δ 18 O-NO 3 δ 15 N-NO 3, allowed to differentiate nitrates of chemical fertilisers from those of biological origin, as well as denitrification processes...|$|E

40|$|The {{ecotoxicological}} {{characterization of}} sewage sludge {{takes into account the}} additive, antagonistic and synergistic effects that occur as a result of multi-chemical interactions. Such an evaluation therefore is essential to complement the chemical analysis that, although required by law, is clearly insufficient. Using a tiered approach in the toxic evaluation {{of sewage sludge}} allows for characterization of toxicity in a timely manner. According to the literature, reproduction tests with Folsomia candida are suitable tools for the toxic assessment of organic sludges. Therefore, the inclusion of Collembola avoidance tests at a screening level (low tier), and acting as a trigger for longer-period tests (high tier; e. g. reproduction test), may provide a successful strategy, and may complement the currently proposed test battery. To evaluate the use of both avoidance and reproduction tests with collembolans in such a tiered approach, three sewage <b>sludges</b> (<b>urban,</b> olive and electroplating industries) were mixed in with a field-collected soil at different concentrations. Avoidance and reproduction tests were performed with the soil-sludge mixtures after 0, 4 and 12 weeks of incubation. The tests detected no toxicity in soil-sludge mixtures of <b>urban</b> and olive <b>sludges</b> at any incubation period. Mixtures with sludge from the electroplating industry induced toxicity only in the avoidance tests with freshly prepared and 4 -week incubated samples. These results demonstrate the ability of Collembola avoidance tests to assess sewage sludge toxicity over time and its potential for hazardous sludge characterization at low tier levels. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Introduction: Earthworms {{are among}} the most {{important}} organisms in soil and their activities can be an indicator of soil quality. These organisms may be influenced by organic wastes application such as sewage sludge and subsequently affect soil quality. One of the quick and easy methods for soil quality monitoring is the use of biological indicators such as microbial activity. It is due to their quick response to changes in the environment. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of earthworms on nitrification rate and arginine ammonification as microbial activity in a calcareous soil amended with <b>urban</b> sewage <b>sludge.</b> Materials and Methods: The studied soil was sampled from Shahrekord University land and sewage sludge belonged to the refinery sludge ponds of shahrekord. Based on dry weight, this organic waste had carbon and nitrogen, approximately 67 and 110 times more than tested soil, respectively. The organic waste in terms of quality and heavy metal concentrations was in class A. Experimental treatments were sewage sludge (without and with 1. 5...|$|R
