5|$|Tchaikovsky's {{analysis}} {{of each of}} The Five was unsparing. While {{at least some of}} his observations may seem distorted and prejudiced, he also mentions some details which ring clear and true. His diagnosis of Rimsky-Korsakov's creative crisis is very accurate. He also calls Mussorgsky the most gifted musically of the Five, though Tchaikovsky could not appreciate the forms Mussorgsky's originality took. Nonetheless, he badly <b>underestimates</b> Borodin's technique and gives Balakirev far less than his full due—all the more telling in light of Balakirev's help in conceiving and shaping Romeo and Juliet.|$|E
5|$|Males tend to {{move over}} longer {{distances}} than females. The average home range size in Fleming's study was 1.33hectares (3.3acres); males had larger home ranges on average. Specimens {{that were once}} captured tended to be captured more frequently than those {{that had never been}} captured. Fleming estimated that population densities reached peaks of up to 4.3 per ha (1.7 per acre) late in the rainy season (October–November), but dropped to near zero around June; however, these figures may well be <b>underestimates.</b> In central Venezuela, population densities vary from 5.5 to 9.6 per ha (2.2 to 3.8 per acre).|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys dimidiatus is now {{recognized}} as one of eight species in the genus Oryzomys. O.dimidiatus is further part of the O.couesi section, which is centered on the widespread Central American O.couesi and also includes six other species with more limited and peripheral distributions. O.couesi occurs with O.dimidiatus in southeastern Nicaragua. Many aspects of the systematics of the O.couesi section remain unclear and {{it is likely that the}} current classification <b>underestimates</b> the true diversity of the group. Oryzomys is classified in the tribe Oryzomyini ("rice rats"), a diverse assemblage of American rodents of over a hundred species, and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of family Cricetidae, along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents.|$|E

High strength for clear segment would be <b>underestimated,</b> but low strength for knot segment is not <b>underestimated.</b> Although the <b>underestimated</b> strength {{is assigned to}} clear segment, the assigned strength {{is higher than the}} strength for weak section. Thus, the <b>underestimated</b> strength for clear segment did not significantly govern the bending strength of GLT.|$|R

5|$|Oryzomys gorgasi is the southeasternmost {{representative}} of the genus Oryzomys, which extends north into the eastern United States (marsh rice rat, O.palustris). O.gorgasi is further part of the O.couesi section, which is centered on the widespread Central American O.couesi and also includes six other species with more limited and peripheral distributions. Many aspects of the systematics of the O.couesi section remain unclear {{and it is likely}} that the current classification <b>underestimates</b> the true diversity of the group.

5|$|According to the {{classification}} by Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, Oryzomys antillarum {{is one of}} eight species in the genus Oryzomys, which occurs from the eastern United States (O.palustris) into northwestern South America (O.gorgasi). O.antillarum is further part of the O.couesi section, which is centered on the widespread Central American O.couesi and also includes various other species with more limited and peripheral distributions. Many aspects of the systematics of the O.couesi section remain unclear {{and it is likely}} that the current classification <b>underestimates</b> the true diversity of the group. Oryzomys previously included many other species, which were progressively removed in various studies culminating in the 2006 paper by Weksler and colleagues, which excluded more than forty species from the genus. All are classified in the tribe Oryzomyini ("rice rats"), a diverse assemblage of American rodents of over a hundred species, and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of family Cricetidae, along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents.|$|E
5|$|O.albiventer {{is part of}} {{the genus}} Oryzomys, which {{currently}} includes about eight species distributed from the eastern United States (O.palustris) into northwestern South America (O.gorgasi). O.albiventer is further part of the O.couesi section, which is centered on the widespread Central American O.couesi and also includes various other species with more limited and peripheral distributions. Many aspects of the systematics of the O.couesi section remain unclear and {{it is likely that the}} current classification <b>underestimates</b> the true diversity of the group. Oryzomys previously included many other species, which were progressively removed in various studies culminating in a contribution by Marcelo Weksler and coworkers in 2006 that removed more than forty species from the genus.

50|$|Note: the {{standard}} error and {{the standard}} deviation of small samples tend to systematically <b>underestimate</b> the population standard error and standard deviation: the standard error of the mean is a biased estimator of the population standard error.

Sokal and Rohlf (1981) give an equation of the correction factor for small samples of n < 20. See unbiased estimation of standard deviation for further discussion.|$|R

SOII provides little incident-level detail that can help to guide MVC prevention initiatives. Further, because SOII does not cover certain worker groups such as agricultural workers on farms with fewer than 11 employees and the self-employed, it undoubtedly <b>underestimates</b> the number of work-related MVCs and other events.|$|E
