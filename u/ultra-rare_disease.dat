Consequently, the approach will aid clinicians by greatly narrowing (by 27. 6 -fold) the search space of potential diagnoses for patients with suspected developmental disorders. Furthermore, this Clinical Face Phenotype Space allows the clustering of patients by phenotype even when no known syndrome diagnosis exists, thereby aiding disease identification.

40|$|Background: Patients {{with rare}} and {{ultra-rare}} diseases make heavy {{demands on the}} resources of both health and social services, but these resources are often used inefficiently due to delays in diagnosis, poor and fragmented care. We analysed the national service for an <b>ultra-rare</b> <b>disease,</b> Alstrom syndrome, and compared the outcome and cost of the service to the standard care. Methods: Between the 9 th and 26 th of March 2014 we undertook a cross-sectional study of the UK Alstrom syndrome patients and their carers. We developed a semi-structured questionnaire to assess our rare patient need, quality of care and costs incurred to patients and their careers. In the UK all Alstrom syndrome patients are seen in two centres, based in Birmingham, and we systematically evaluated the national service and compared the quality and cost of care with patients ’ previous standard of care. Results: One quarter of genetically confirmed Alstrom syndrome UK patients were enrolled in this study. Patients that {{have access to a}} highly specialised clinical service reported that their care is well organised, personalised, holistic, and that they have a say in their care.

There is no therapy for AKU. Our aim was to verify if AKU implied a secondary amyloidosis. Congo Red, Thioflavin-T staining and TEM were performed to assess amyloid presence in AKU specimens (cartilage, synovia, periumbelical fat, salivary gland) and in HGA-treated human chondrocytes and cartilage. SAA and SAP deposition was examined using immunofluorescence and their levels were evaluated in the patients' plasma by ELISA. 2 D electrophoresis was undertaken in AKU cells to evaluate the levels of proteins involved in amyloidogenesis. AKU osteoarticular tissues contained SAA-amyloid in 7 / 7 patients. Ochronotic pigment and amyloid co-localized in AKU osteoarticular tissues. SAA and SAP composition of the deposits assessed secondary type of amyloidosis. High levels of SAA and SAP were found in AKU patients' plasma. Systemic amyloidosis was assessed by Congo Red staining of patients' abdominal fat and salivary gland. AKU is the second pathology after Parkinson's disease where amyloid is associated with a form of melanin. Aberrant expression of proteins involved in amyloidogenesis has been found in AKU cells. Our findings on alkaptonuria as a novel type II AA amyloidosis open new important perspectives for its therapy, since methotrexate treatment proved to significantly reduce in vitro HGA-induced A-amyloid aggregates...|$|E
40|$|Background Alkaptonuria (AKU) is an <b>ultra-rare</b> <b>disease</b> {{associated}} {{to the lack}} of an enzyme involved in tyrosine catabolism. This deficiency results in the accumulation of homogentisic acid (HGA) in the form of ochronotic pigment in joint cartilage, leading to a severe arthropathy. Secondary amyloidosis has been also unequivocally assessed as a comorbidity of AKU arthropathy. Composition of ochronotic pigment and how it is structurally related to amyloid is still unknown. Methods We exploited Synchrotron Radiation Infrared and X-Ray Fluorescence microscopies in combination with conventional bio-assays and analytical tools to characterize chemical composition and morphology of AKU cartilage. Results We evinced that AKU cartilage is characterized by proteoglycans depletion, increased Sodium levels, accumulation of lipids in the peri-lacunar regions and amyloid formation. We also highlighted an increase of aromatic compounds and oxygen-containing species, depletion in overall Magnesium content (although localized in the peri-lacunar region) and the presence of calcium carbonate fragments in proximity of cartilage lacunae. Conclusions We highlighted common features between AKU and arthropathy, but also specific signatures of the disease, like presence of amyloids and peculiar calcifications. Our analyses provide a unified picture of AKU cartilage, shedding a new light on the disease and opening new perspectives. General significance Ochronotic pigment is a hallmark of AKU and responsible of tissue degeneration. Conventional bio-assays have not yet clarified its composition and its structural relationship with amyloids. The present work proposes new strategies for filling the aforementioned gap that encompass the integration of new analytical approaches with standardized analyses...|$|E
40|$|Alkaptonuria (AKU) is an <b>ultra-rare</b> genetic <b>disease,</b> {{in which}} the {{accumulation}} of a toxic metabolite, homogentisic acid (HGA) leads to the systemic development of ochronotic aggregates. These aggregates cause severe complications mainly {{at the level of}} joints with extensive degradation of the articular cartilage. Primary cilia have been demonstrated to play an essential role in development and the maintenance of articular cartilage homeostasis, through their involvement in mechanosignaling and Hedgehog signaling pathways. Hedgehog signaling has been demonstrated to be activated in osteoarthritis (OA) and to drive cartilage degeneration in vivo. The numerous similarities between OA and AKU suggest that primary cilia Hedgehog signaling may also be altered in AKU. Thus, we characterized an AKU cellular model in which healthy chondrocytes were treated with HGA (66 μM) to replicate AKU cartilage pathology. We investigated the degree of activation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway and how treatment with inhibitors of the receptor Smoothened (Smo) influenced Hedgehog activation and primary cilia structure. The results obtained in this work provide a further step in the comprehension of the pathophysiological features of AKU, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach to modulate AKU cartilage degradation processes through manipulation of the Hedgehog pathway...|$|R

In the present paper, we report the expression of HGD in the brain. Mouse and human brain tissues were positively tested for HGD gene expression by western blotting. Furthermore, HGD expression was confirmed in human neuronal cells that also revealed the presence of six HGD molecular species. Moreover, once cultured in HGA excess, human neuronal cells produced ochronotic pigment and amyloid.

40|$|Alkaptonuria (AKU) is an <b>ultra-rare</b> genetic <b>disease</b> {{resulting}} from a deficient activity of the enzyme homogentisate 1, 2 - dioxygenase (HGD), responsible for the catabolism of the aromatic amino acids Phenylalanine and Tyrosine. This condition leads to the accumulation of a toxic metabolite, HGA and of its product of oxidation BQA, whose polymerization generates melanin-like aggregates, with amyloidogenic properties, leading to the phenomenon of “Ochronosis”. The most affected structures by the deposition of these ochronotic aggregates are joints, which undergo severe arthropathy; therefore, articular cartilage is the main investigated tissue for the comprehension of AKU physiopathology. Articular cartilage homeostasis is maintained by articular chondrocytes, which {{have an important role}} in the synthesis and release of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, essential to properly respond to mechanical compression processes the tissue is constantly subjected to. This mechanism is mediated by chondrocyte cytoskeleton, including the microtubule-based organelle primary cilium, which exerts its function through the activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. On the basis of the previous considerations, for the aims of this thesis, the set-up of in vitro AKU cellular and tissue models, was fundamental to counteract problems related to the collection of AKU samples, due to the rarity of the disease. Both experimental models were properly characterized, by highlighting the role of HGA in mediating pigment deposition and cartilage degradation processes, through histological and cytological analyses and immunofluorescence assays. Results showed that the ochronotic pigment deposits following HGA treatment lead to an oxidative stress status and to the accumulation of serum amyloid A (SAA) protein in the cartilaginous tissue. Another in vitro model was used to analyse the ability of AKU chondrocytes to respond to mechanical loading in terms of production of ECM components, by applying a 10...|$|R

Recently, high prices for ultra-OMPs {{have given rise to}} debate on the sustainability and justification of these prices. The aim {{of this article is to}} review the international scientific literature on the pricing of ultra-OMPs and to provide an overview of the current knowledge on the drivers of ultra-OMP pricing. The pricing process of ultra-OMPs is a complex and nontransparent issue. Evidence in the literature seems to indicate that ultra-OMPs are priced according to rarity and what the manufacturer believes the market will bear. Additionally, there appears to be a trend between the price of an ultra-OMP and the number of available alternatives. Patients, third-party payers, and pharmaceutical companies could benefit from more transparent pricing strategies. With a view to containing health care costs, it is likely that cost-sharing strategies, such as performance-based risk sharing arrangements, will become increasingly more important. However, it is vital that any measures for price control are consistent with the intended goals of the incentives to promote the development of new OMPs. Ideally, a balance must be struck between attaining affordable prices for ultra-OMPs and securing a realistic return on investment for the pharmaceutical industry.

There are currently no treatments for any of the forms of CMTs or GAN. We suggest that further clinical studies should analyse electrical impedance myography as an outcome measure for CMT. Further, additional quality of life (QoL) assessments for these CMTs are required, and we need to identify GAN biomarkers as well as develop new genetic testing panels for both diseases.

Prevalence estimates of rare diseases {{are important to}} increase awareness and financial resources. Current qualitative and quantitative estimates of LD prevalence range from ~ 0. 1 to 90 cases/million. We demonstrate an approach to quantitatively estimate LD prevalence (all, generalized, and partial) through a search of 5 electronic medical record (EMR) databases and 4 literature searches. Methods: EMR and literature searches were conducted from 2012 to 2014. For the EMR database searches (Quintiles, IMS LifeLink, General Electric Healthcare, and Humedica EMR), LD cases were identified by the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD- 9 -CM) code 272. 6 (United Kingdom General Practice Research Database used other diagnostic codes to identify LD) plus additional LD-associated clinical characteristics (patients with HIV or documented HIV treatment were excluded). Expert adjudication of cases {{was used for the}} Quintiles database only. Literature searches (PubMed and EMBASE) were conducted for each of the 4 major LD subtypes. Prevalence estimates were determined by extrapolating the total number of cases identified for each search to the database population (EMR search) and European population (literature search). Results: The prevalence range of all LD across all EMR databases was 1. 3 – 4. 7 cases/million. For the adjudicated Quintiles search, the estimated prevalence of diagnosed LD was 3. 07 cases/million (95 % confidence interval [CI], 2. 30 – 4. 02), 0. 23 cases/million (95 % CI, 0. 06 – 0. 59) and 2. 84 cases/million (95 % CI, 2. 10 – 3. 75) for generalized lipodystrophy (GL) and partial lipodystrophy (PL), respectively. For all literature searches, the prevalence of all LD in Europe was 2. 63 cases/million (0. 96 and 1. 67 cases/million for GL and PL, respectively).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Alkaptonuria (AKU) is an <b>ultra-rare</b> {{autosomal}} recessive <b>disease</b> that currently lacks an appropriate therapy. Recently we provided experimental evidence that AKU is a secondary serum amyloid A (SAA) -based amyloidosis. The {{aim of the}} present work was {{to evaluate the use}} of antioxidants to inhibit SAA amyloid and pro-inflammatory cytokine release in AKU. METHODS: We adopted a human chondrocytic cell AKU model to evaluate the anti-amyloid capacity of a set of antioxidants that had previously been shown to counteract ochronosis in a serum AKU model. Amyloid presence was evaluated by Congo red staining. Homogentisic acid-induced SAA production and pro-inflammatory cytokine release (overexpressed in AKU patients) were evaluated by ELISA and multiplex systems, respectively. Lipid peroxidation was evaluated by means of a fluorescence-based assay. RESULTS: Our AKU model allowed us to prove the efficacy of ascorbic acid combined with N-acetylcysteine, taurine, phytic acid and lipoic acid in significantly inhibiting SAA production, pro-inflammatory cytokine release and membrane lipid peroxidation. CONCLUSION: All the tested antioxidant compounds were able to reduce the production of amyloid and may be the basis for establishing new therapies for AKU amyloidosis...|$|R
40|$|This project {{carries out}} an {{analysis}} of market access of orphan drugs for rare diseases. In the European Union (EU), orphan drugs are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of rare diseases. These rare diseases are life-threatening or chronically seriously debilitating conditions affecting {{no more than five}} in 10, 000 persons in the EU. Worldwide, policies are available to stimulate the development and marketing of orphan drugs. Such policies serve to compensate industry for the risks and lower potential return on investment due to the low number of patients. Part 1 of this project, the general introduction, provides the definitions and background related to orphan drugs and rare diseases and presents an overview of the different steps of market access of orphan drugs in the EU. The contents of this project reflect these steps, i. e. orphandesignation and marketing authorization are discussed in part 2, pricing is discussed in part 3, reimbursement in part 4 and uptake in part 5. The general introduction also provides an overview of the arguments for and against attributing special status to orphan drugs. Studies on the registration of orphan drugs are reported in part 2. An evaluationof the orphan drug policies in the EU by orphan drug experts is provided in chapter 2. 1. Experts perceive the orphan drug policies in the EU asuseful. Within the context of continuing to optimize patient access to orphan drugs, several policy recommendations were formulated such as defining the concept of sufficiently profitable in the context of reducing the period of market exclusivity for highly profitable orphan drugs, determining the level of clinical evidence needed to authorize orphan drugs, etc. Chapter 2. 2 describes the development and validation of a new tool, COMPASS, to assess the quality of orphan drugs clinical evidence presented for orphan drugs at the time of marketing authorization. The tool was drawn up based on elements derived from existing checklists supplemented with items specifically related to rare diseases and orphan drugs as recommended by six experts. The COMPASS tool can for examplebe used by local reimbursement agencies for the review of clinical evidence in orphan drug registration dossiers or by clinicians and pharmacists upon considering a (new) orphan drug treatment. The COMPASS tool was used in chapter 2. 3 to quantitatively evaluate the characteristicsand quality of pivotal studies presented for orphan drugs authorised inthe EU before July 1 st, 2012. These studies were found to exhibit methodological flaws such as lack of blinding in the study design, lack of QoL-related endpoints as outcome, use of surrogate endpoints, etc. Additionally, there were important shortcomings in the reporting of those studies, which further complicates the interpretation of the clinical evidence. This study shows that a more demanding regulatory process for orphan drugs is needed. Studies on the pricing of orphan drugs are reported in part 3. The influence of orphan designation status on prices of drugs for rare indications is demonstrated in chapter 3. 1. The analysis showed that the median price per defined daily dose was higher for drugs with an orphan designation ( 138. 56) than for drugs without an orphan designation used for rare indications ( 16. 55). Chapter 3. 2 providesseveral examples of repurposed drugs for rare indications for which theeffectiveness evidence was published prior to the application for orphan designation status. Upon comparing Belgian hospital prices per defineddaily dose of selected drugs for common diseases with the price of repurposed drugs for the rare disease indication, differences of up to 200 fold were reported. This pricing practice adds to the budget impact of treating rare diseases. An overview of the international scientificliterature on the drivers of pricing of ultra-orphan drugs in describedin chapter 3. 3. <b>Ultra-rare</b> <b>diseases</b> constitute an informal subcategory,within rare diseases, to describe very rare diseases (i. e. occurring inless than one per 50, 000 individuals). The pricing process of ultra-orphan drugs is a complex and non-transparent issue. Evidence in the literature seems to indicate that ultra-orphan drugs are priced based on rarity of the indication and the number of available alternatives. Chapter 3. 4 shows how various drug- and disease-specific variables relate toannual treatment costs per patient and per orphan drug indication in six EU Member States. Additionally, it was investigated if certain country-specific pricing and reimbursement policies affect the price level of orphan drugs. Repurposed orphan drugs, orally administered orphan drugs or orphan drugs for which an alternative treatment is available are associated with lower annual treatment costs. Orphan drugs with multiple orphan indications, for chronic treatments or for which an improvement in overall survival or quality-of-life has been demonstrated, are associated with higher annual treatment costs. No association was found between annual treatments cost of orphan drugs across countries and the different pricing and reimbursement systems. Current debate about the affordabilityof high-priced orphan drugs highlights the need for more transparency in orphan drug price setting. The topic of reimbursement of orphan drugs is discussed in part 4. Because of their high price and difficulties in demonstrating effectiveness, orphan drugs are often perceived as not able to provide value for money. In chapter 4. 1 an overview of the evidence on the value for money of orphan drugs is given. Results show that orphan drugs can provide value for money. Considering a threshold of £ 30, 000 per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) (i. e. threshold for reimbursement applied in England and Wales) ten {{out of a total of}} nineteen orphan drugs for which data was available, offer value for money. Factors other than cost-effectiveness are also taken into account at the time of reimbursement In chapter 4. 2 qualitative research methods were applied to establish that various official (i. e. therapeutic value, budget impact, price and impact in clinical practice) and non-official (i. e. pricing and reimbursement in other countries, interference by patient organisations and experts, arguments related to quality of pharmaceutical compounding, media attention, innovative character, economic importance, ethical arguments and the political climate) factors might influence reimbursement decisions for orphan drugs in Belgium. The identification of these factors is crucial in the development of a transparent and consistent framework which will guide future decision-making for reimbursement of orphan drugs. A study on the uptake of orphan drugs is reported in part 5. Chapter 5. 1 shows that the uptake of orphan drugs varies across EU Member States. The highest volumes of orphan drugs in the first year occurred in Member States with a high gross domestic product (GDP) and implicitly, a higher budget for health care, independently of the existence of a formal health technology assessment (HTA) organisation. In contrast, in countries with a low GDP, orphan drugs were less available incountries with a formal HTA-organisation. There, budgetary restrictionscan cause the exclusion of less cost-effective orphan drugs. These variations have important implications with respect to access to orphan drugs. Recommendations for a sustainable orphan drug market are proposed in the general discussion in part 6. These recommendations relate toone (or more) of the steps of market access. Several recommendations toimprove quality of clinical evidence (for instance by setting trial standards imposing the use of at least one hard endpoint) are formulated. Furthermore, to capture what is valued by patients, patient(s) (organizations) should be able to provide input in an early stage on what endpoints should be considered when developing a new drug for a rare disease. Development of new orphan drugs can be improved by adopting a public-private partnership approach for orphan drug development. Patient registries are an important tool to gather knowledge about the natural course of a rare disease and/or the long-term effectiveness of an orphan drug. Long-term data is required for marketing authorization and to guide reimbursement decisions. Recommendations relating to pricing of orphan drugs include measures to increase transparency in orphan drug pricing, a proposalto prescribe repurposed orphan drugs by international non-proprietary name and a call to revise orphan drug status of sufficiently profitable orphan drugs. Timely access to new orphan drugs can be achieved by implementing managed entry agreements to deal with the uncertainty about cost-effectiveness and by optimizing reimbursement procedures for orphan drugs across EU Member States. Finally, there is a need to define prioritiesin funding and reimbursement of orphan drugs. Upcoming challenges for the orphan drug pharmaceutical industry are also discussed. For instance,adaptive licensing is expected to reduce the overall cost of development and to have a positive effect on timely access to new drugs. Future research could focus on pricing and budget impact orphan drugs, an issue of continued importance in the aftermath of the financial and economic crisis. status: publishe...|$|R
