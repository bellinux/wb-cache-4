Msiri achieved what other tribes and the Portuguese had tried without as much success, which was to trade across the continent, with both coasts.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the spoken {{language}} suffered {{none of the}} constraints that applied to the written language and Brazilian Portuguese sounds very {{different than any other}} derivative of Portuguese. Brazilians, when concerned with pronunciation, look <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> is considered the national standard variety, and never the European one, specially after a lot of tension between Portugal and the settlers (immigrants) in Brazil since the country's de-facto settlement, as immigrants were forbidden of speaking freely on their native languages in Brazil by fear of severe punishment by the Portuguese law enforcers. Lately, Brazilians in general have had some exposure to European speech, through TV and music. Often one will see Brazilian actors working in Portugal, and Portuguese actors working in Brazil, despite the differences on spoken language.|$|E

500|$|Manson has {{referred}} to Born Villain as the band's [...] "grandest concept record". He has said its title {{was inspired by the}} controversy which surrounded the band after the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, when elements of the mainstream media falsely accused the band of influencing its perpetrators. The title also references the nature versus nurture argument, with Manson elaborating to CNN: [...] "In any story, the villain is the catalyst. The hero's not a person who will bend the rules or show the cracks in his armor. He's one-dimensional intentionally, but the villain is the person who owns <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> he is and stands by it. He'll do things that are sometimes morally questionable, but he does it because it's his nature to do it, and it never fluctuates." ...|$|E
