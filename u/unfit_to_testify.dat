5000|$|During {{the hearing}} on January 13, 2010, Chester Stranczeks attorney, Chris Gair from the Chicago firm Jenner & Block, {{presented}} as a witness Dr. Cindy Zadikoff, {{an assistant professor of}} neurology specializing in movement disorders at NorthWestern Memorial Hospital. According to Maura Possley of the SouthTown Star Newspaper [...] "Dr. Zadikoff examined Stranczek in August and October. The doctor testified that his wife reported that Stranczek, when they returned from their Boca Raton home to their Crestwood house, would forget where the bathroom or bedroom were." [...] The same article {{goes on to say that}} [...] "Plaintiffs attorney Burton Weinstein ( [...] a partner at the Chicago law firm of Baskin, Server, Berke & Weinstein [...] ) questioned whether Stranczek could exaggerate symptoms or fake his way through her exams to try to indicate he was <b>unfit</b> <b>to</b> <b>testify.</b> Weinstein also referred to reports from Stranczek's former doctor of him having less-severe memory loss and said some of Stranczek's medications were known to heighten confusion or memory loss." ...|$|E

However, the only witness {{to be heard}} was Dr. Peter Parkes, medical officer at Horfield Prison, who <b>testified</b> <b>to</b> Straffen's medical history and stated his {{conclusion}} that Straffen was <b>unfit</b> <b>to</b> plead. Oliver commented: [...] "In this country we do not try people who are insane. You might as well try a baby in arms. If a man cannot understand what is going on, he cannot be tried."

40|$|Introduction: The {{diagnoses of}} workers being <b>unfit</b> <b>to</b> work {{may be a}} {{relevant}} health indicator. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to analyze the one-year incidence of an <b>unfit</b> <b>to</b> work diagnosis. Method: This one-year prospective study included all workers undergoing annual work medical examination from occupational health services in Troyes, France. Results: Twenty-one occupational physicians followed 54, 026 employees. The all-cause incidence of being <b>unfit</b> <b>to</b> return to work was 0. 772 %. The two main causes of being <b>unfit</b> <b>to</b> work were musculoskeletal disorders (61 %) and psychopathologies (24 %). The relative risk (RR) of being <b>unfit</b> <b>to</b> work, independent of the cause, was higher when employees were aged over 50 years (RR = 2. 51), and female (RR = 1. 51). Conclusions: Prospective results from occupational physicians’ medical records may provide significant and cost-effective directions to prioritize actions and target health promotion in the workplace...|$|R
