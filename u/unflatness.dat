40|$|The 53. 667 MHz continuous-wave {{heavy ion}} RFQ has been {{designed}} and manufactured for the SSC-LINAC project. This four-rod RFQ accelerates ions with maximum mass to charge ratio of 7 from 3. 728 keV/u to 143 keV/u. Measurements {{have been carried out}} to check the RF performance of the cavity {{and the quality of the}} electric field. The S- 11 of the power coupler is adjusted to better than - 44 dB, and the Q (0) of the cavity is 6440. The quality of the electric field is evaluated by the perturbation method. The measurement procedure and data analysis will be discussed in detail. The error due to gravity of the perturbation bead has been corrected by averaging the fields in different quadrants. As a result, the <b>unflatness</b> of the electric field is +/- 2. 5 %, and the dipole field component distributes from 0 % to 20 % in different longitudinal positions, which indicates the asymmetry of the quadrupole field.

To reduce the disturbance from the test environment, a dielectric block {{has been used as}} the perturbation body instead of the beads. The error induced by the block and the sampling approach have been investigated.

The injector upgrade of {{it aims to}} improve its reliability and mitigate the radiological activation due to electron losses at hundreds of MeV. Therefore, a 2. 998 GHz hybrid buncher has been developed and will be installed in between a pre-buncher and LINAC II. It comprises a 1 - cell standing-wave (SW) section for rapid acceleration and a 13 -cells travelling-wave (TW) section for further bunching and acceleration. This paper focuses on its RF tuning procedure. The tuning strategy combines a nonresonant bead-pull measurement of complex electric field and a linear model for local reflection coefficient calculation. The tuning result is satisfying.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the influence of}} raw image preprocessing and other selected processes on the accuracy of close-range photogrammetric measurement. The examined processes and features includes: raw image preprocessing, sensor <b>unflatness,</b> distance-dependent lens distortion, extending the input observations (image measurements) by incorporating all RGB colour channels, ellipse centre eccentricity and target detecting. The examination of each effect is carried out experimentally by performing the validation procedure proposed in the German VDI guideline 2634 / 1. The validation procedure is based on performing standard photogrammetric measurements of high-accurate calibrated measuring lines (multi-scale bars) with known lengths (typical uncertainty = 5 μm at 2 sigma). The comparison of the measured lengths with the known values gives the maximum length measurement error LME, which characterize {{the accuracy of the}} validated photogrammetric system. For higher reliability the VDI test field was photographed ten times independently with the same configuration and camera settings. The images were acquired with the metric ALPA 12 WA camera. The tests are performed on all ten measurements which gives the possibility to measure the repeatability of the estimated parameters as well. The influences are examined by comparing the quality characteristics of the reference and tested settings...|$|E
40|$|Sheet (0. 41 - 4. 80 mm thick) or {{thin plate}} {{structures}} commonly exist in additively manufactured Ti- 6 Al- 4 V components for load-bearing applications. A batch of 64 Ti- 6 Al- 4 V sheet samples with dimensions of 210 / 180 mm × 42 mm × 3 mm have been additively manufactured by selective {{electron beam melting}} (SEBM). A comprehensive assessment was then made of their density, surface flatness, microstructure, and mechanical properties in both as-built and hot isostatically pressed conditions, including {{the influence of the}} hot isostatic pressing (HIP) temperature. In particular, standard long tensile (156 mm long, 2 mm thick) and fatigue (206 mm long, 2 mm thick) test sheet samples were used for assessment. As-built SEBM Ti- 6 Al- 4 V sheet samples with machined surfaces fully satisfied the minimum tensile property requirements for mill-annealed TIMETAL Ti- 6 Al- 4 V sheet products, whereas HIP-processed samples (2 mm thick) with machined surfaces achieved a high cycle fatigue (HCF) strength of 625 MPa (R = 0. 06, 107 cycles), similar to mill-annealed Ti- 6 Al- 4 V (500 - 700 MPa). The <b>unflatness</b> was limited to 0. 2 mm in both the as-built and HIP-processed conditions.

40|$|A {{deuteron}} radio-frequency quadrupole (RFQ) {{is being}} built by the RFQ group at Peking University. It is a very compact high-current RFQ, operating at 162. 5  MHz in continuous-wave mode. By optimizing the beam dynamics design, our simulations reached 98 % transmission efficiency for acceleration of the 50 -mA deuteron beam from 50  keV to 1  MeV, with an intervane voltage of 60  kV and a length of 1. 809  m. This RFQ adopts a window-type structure, with low power consumption and sufficient mode separation, with no stabilizing rods required. Its magnetic coupling windows have been optimized by both electromagnetic simulation {{and the construction of}} an equivalent circuit model. The empirical equation based on the circuit model provides a new way to evaluate the effect of the window size on the frequency. In addition, an aluminum model of the full-length RFQ has been built and tested, and the results show good agreement with the simulations. During the tuning process, the magnetic coupling effect between quadrants was found to be unique to the window-type RFQ. We also propose a method to estimate the effects of different degrees of electric field <b>unflatness</b> on the beam transmission. For the cooling system design, the results of thermostructural analysis, verified by comparing results from ansys and cst, show that the special cooling channels provide a high cooling efficiency around the magnetic coupling windows.

Dry grinding, flood grinding, minimal quantity of lubrication (MQL), and nanoparticle jet MQL {{were used in}} the grinding experiments. The specific grinding energy of dry grinding, flood grinding and MQL were 84, 29. 8, 45. 5  J/mm 3, respectively. The specific grinding energy significantly decreased to 32. 7  J/mm 3 in nanoparticle MQL. Compared with dry grinding, the surface roughness values of flood grinding, MQL, and nanoparticle jet MQL were significantly reduced with the surface topography profile values reduced by 11 %, 2. 5 %, and 10 %, respectively, and the ten point height of microcosmic <b>unflatness</b> values reduced by 1. 5 %, 0. 5 %, and 1. 3 %, respectively. These results verified the satisfactory lubrication effects of nanoparticle MQL. MoS 2, carbon nanotube (CNT), and ZrO 2 nanoparticles were also added in the grinding fluid of nanoparticle jet MQL to analyze their grinding surface lubrication effects. The specific grinding energy of MoS 2 nanoparticle was only 32. 7  J/mm 3, which was 8. 22 % and 10. 39 % lower than those of the other two nanoparticles. Moreover, the surface roughness of workpiece was also smaller with MoS 2 nanoparticle, which indicated its remarkable lubrication effects. Furthermore, the role of MoS 2 particles in the grinding surface lubrication at different nanoparticle volume concentrations was analyzed. MoS 2 volume concentrations of 1 %, 2 %, and 3 % were used. Experimental results revealed that the specific grinding energy and the workpiece surface roughness initially increased and then decreased as MoS 2 nanoparticle volume concentration increased. Satisfactory grinding surface lubrication effects were obtained with 2 % MoS 2 nanoparticle volume concentration...|$|E
40|$|The {{injector}} upgrade of LINAC II at DESY aims {{to improve}} its reliability and mitigate the radiological activation of components due to electron loss at relatively high energy of hundreds of MeV. Therefore, a 2. 998 GHz hybrid buncher has been developed and will be installed in between an existing 2. 998 GHz pre-buncher and LINAC II. It comprises a 1 -cell standing-wave (SW) section for rapid electron acceleration and a 13 -cells traveling-wave (TW) section for further beam bunching and acceleration. This paper focuses on its radio-frequency tuning procedure. The tuning strategy combines a non-resonant bead-pull measurement of complex electric field and a linear model for local reflection coefficient calculation. It is demonstrated that imaginary part of the local reflection coefficient represents the field distribution straightforwardly, based on which the structure can be tuned from cell to cell. During tuning, special {{attention has been paid}} to the field enhancement in the SW section to ensure its beam-capturing capability. Field amplitude and phase, global and local reflection coefficients have been analyzed for two different frequencies simultaneously, i. e. the intrinsic frequency of the structure and the target frequency, to avoid over-tuning. The tuning result is satisfying. For the target frequency, field <b>unflatness</b> of the TW section has been reduced from ± 9 % to ± 4 %, and field in the SW section has been enhanced significantly. Meanwhile, in the TW section, the deviation of phase advances between adjacent cells from the nominal value 120 ° has been reduced from the range ± 5 ° to ± 2 °. By using ASTRA simulation, it has been verified that the residual detuning of the structure is acceptable in view of the beam dynamics performance...|$|E
