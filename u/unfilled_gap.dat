Second, these rural markets seem likely to continue harboring <b>unfilled</b> <b>gaps,</b> compared to national capital markets. Third, structural changes in the markets can have both positive and negative impacts on availability of financial services in nonmetropolitan America. Finally, rural capital markets are expected to carry the burden of financial lubricant to support expanded rural economic development efforts. For purposes of this paper, rural is assumed to be synonymous with nonmetropolitan, since data are typically organized on the basis of a metropolitan/nonmetropolitan framework. Marked diversity exists across rural communities. Differing levels of success in achieving rural economic development are evidence of that diversity. Some rural communities have achieved growth within regions of little growth. Others have not. Efforts by lenders and community leaders have resulted in rural capital markets more successfully supporting economic growth in some settings than in others. Nonetheless, a more clear understanding of changes in these markets will help lenders and communities to more effectively shape and use rural capital markets. This paper is organized into three sections. The first section explores the performance of nonmetropolitan, compared to metropolitan, America in population, employment, and income growth.

40|$|Although {{chlorophyll}} (Chl) degradation is {{an essential}} biochemical pathway for plant physiology, our knowledge regarding this process still has <b>unfilled</b> <b>gaps.</b> Pheophytinase (PPH) was shown to be essential for Chl breakdown in dark-induced senescent leaves. However, the catalyzing enzymes involved in pigment turnover and fruit ripening-associated degreening are still controversial. Chl metabolism is {{closely linked to the}} biosynthesis of other isoprenoid-derived compounds, such as carotenoids and tocopherols, which are also components of the photosynthetic machinery. Chls, carotenoids and tocopherols share a common precursor, geranylgeranyl diphosphate, produced by the plastidial methylerythritol 4 -phosphate (MEP) pathway. Additionally, the Chl degradation-derived phytol can be incorporated into tocopherol biosynthesis. In this context, tomato turns out to be an interesting model to address isoprenoid-metabolic cross-talk since fruit ripening combines degreening and an intensely active MEP leading to carotenoid accumulation. Here, we investigate the impact of PPH deficiency beyond senescence by the comprehensive phenotyping of SlPPH-knockdown tomato plants. In leaves, photosynthetic parameters indicate altered energy usage of excited Chl. As a mitigatory effect, photosynthesis-associated carotenoids increased while tocopherol content remained constant. Additionally, starch and soluble sugar profiles revealed a distinct pattern of carbon allocation in leaves that suggests enhanced sucrose exportation. The higher levels of carbohydrates in sink organs down-regulated carotenoid biosynthesis. Additionally, the reduction in Chl-derived phytol recycling resulted in decreased tocopherol content in transgenic ripe fruits. Summing up, tocopherol and carotenoid metabolism, together with the antioxidant capacity of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions, were differentially affected in leaves and fruits of the transgenic plants. Thus, in tomato, PPH plays a role beyond senescence-associated Chl degradation that, when compromised, affects isoprenoid and carbon metabolism which ultimately alters the fruit's nutraceutical content...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Extensive {{research}} {{exists on}} the role of peacekeeping forces and yet relatively few studies have examined the role of AU mediation and the challenges it encounters in resolving African conflicts. While peacekeeping missions can halt political conflicts, however, literature depicts that they do not help deal with the conflicts from their root causes, and this is the reason why in many places political violence and insecurity have become intractable on the continent. The central aim of this study has been to study the role of mediation in resolving political violence and investigate whether the AU does fully own the mediation process and has autonomy over the mediation agendas and outcome. The study finds that Africa’s most important inter-state actor has no supremacy and wherewithal to act as an autonomous and powerful actor in the mediation process. Autonomous in that it is unable to act independently by setting and presiding of its agenda, and to act victoriously without being overcome by narrow endogenous (Africa) or exogenous (extra African) interests and influence. Challenges that were found depriving the AU of ownership and autonomy in mediation processes are both internal and external. The internal challenges were confirmed to include: the AU’s mediators’ failure to understand the origins, root causes and nature of African conflicts; the AU’s mediators’ lack of professional expertise in conflict analysis; unchecked divisions among AU member states; the AU’s lack of full control and authority over the mediation process; the AU’s lack of professionally trained and experienced mediators in mediation research; weakness of the AU mediation process; <b>unfilled</b> <b>gaps</b> in the AU’s Peace and Security Architecture; the lack of institutionalised mediation architecture and mediation teams at the AU; and lack of African originated resources to support AU mediation processes. The external challenges include: the presence of the seemingly unconquerable external conspiracy of dictatorial forces from the Western countries before and/or during the mediation process. Therefore, with these challenges, the study demonstrated that the AU does neither own mediation processes nor does it have autonomy over the mediation agenda item and outcomes. This was done through the close examination of how the AU mediation team applied the principles governing successful mediation in three African cases [...] . D. Litt. et Phil...|$|R

40|$|Restarting stalled {{replication}} forks {{is vital}} to avoid fatal replication errors. Previously, it was demonstrated that hydroxyurea-stalled replication forks rescue replication either by an active restart mechanism or by new origin firing. To our surprise, using the DNA fibre assay, we only detect a slightly reduced fork speed on a UV-damaged template during the first hour after UV exposure, and no evidence for persistent replication fork arrest. Interestingly, no evidence for persistent UV-induced fork stalling was observed even in translesion synthesis defective, Polηmut cells. In contrast, using an assay to measure DNA molecule elongation at the fork, we observe that continuous DNA elongation is severely blocked by UV irradiation, particularly in UV-damaged Polηmut cells. In conclusion, our data suggest that UV-blocked replication forks restart effectively through re-priming past the lesion, leaving only a small gap opposite the lesion. This allows continuation of replication on damaged DNA.

40|$|A tragic {{massacre}} in May 1921, {{commonly referred to}} as the Bulhoek Massacre, was associated with the ecclesiology of the Church of God and Saints of Christ, founded by Enoch Mgijima. If {{it were not for the}} theology of eschatology that this church adhered to, the so-called Bulhoek Massacre would not have happened. The theology of eschatology which Mgijima was focussing on caused the ecclesiology of the amaSirayeli to be the victims of the circumstances. Dulles defines ecclesiology as the church in the process of self actualisation. There is self understanding of worshippers. In the case of the Church of God and Saints of Christ, such self-understanding caused the Bulhoek Massacre. It is said that when people fervently believe in an Ultimate Being, whether such belief is a construction in their minds or a reality, then those people will be willing to defend their belief and die for, if it needs to be. For such a believer, it is because of the hope for a better life in the future that they are willing to even defy earthly authorities. When that believer follows a voice of the supernatural, which is revealed only to him and sounds much louder, much clearer and more authoritative than human voices, it is then that he cannot be void. Such an authoritative voice may be transmitted either through ancestors, known as the living dead, or directly from the Supreme Being. In the case of the said church, it is both. Secondly, an ecclesiology of the Church of God and Saints of Christ should be understood in the light of their mother church in America under the leadership of Crowdy the founder. Such ecclesiology should also be understood against the religious backdrop of the African Initiated Churches (AIC). These two factors, the mother church in America and the religion of the African Initiated Churches, will be the main components that drive this thesis, and thus illuminate the spark in the said church. Owing to the proliferation of the African Initiated Churches in the continent of Africa, there is a wide speculation that Africa, of the 21 st century, will be the centre of World Christianity. Whether this is just a dream or a reality remains to be realized. But the fact remains that, these churches continue to be a religious force that forms part of the church history in Africa. While this thesis will constantly be referring to the 1921 events, an ecclesiology of the said church is a present phenomenon because the church survived the massacre and is still active today. The two researchers, Robert Edgar from Los Angeles University in the USA, and Martin Mandew from the University of Natal, completed their doctoral theses on the Bulhoek Massacre. Edgar was researching on, The Fifth Seal. Enoch Mgijima, The amaSirayeli Bulhoek Massacre, 1921. Mandew concentrated on, War, Memory and Salvation, The Bulhoek Massacre and the Construction of a Contextual Soteriology. Since both researchers come from a distance, and are unable to speak the language of the people they were researching, there were of obviously <b>unfilled</b> <b>gaps</b> in between. As mentioned about cultural differences, therefore, knowing the language of the worshippers makes a big difference. There needs some analysis of idiomatic expressions, enunciated and other formal and informal expressions that tend to be important during communication. However, I acknowledge their research programme but I will go further from their product. This thesis examines the ecclesiology of this church and then relates it to the massacre where they were killed for their own beliefs. It is also important to analyse, as this thesis does, the church-state relations in South Africa in the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries in order to establish how other religious bodies related to the governments of the said period.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} body of {{evidence}} that the processes mediating the allocation of spatial attention within objects may be separable from those governing attentional distribution between objects. In the neglect literature, a related proposal has been made regarding the perception of (within-object) sizes and (between-object) distances. This proposal follows observations that, in size-matching and bisection tasks, neglect is more strongly expressed when patients are required to attend to the sizes of discrete objects than to the (unfilled) distances between objects. These findings are consistent with a partial dissociation between size and distance processing, but a simpler alternative must also be considered. Whilst a neglect patient may fail to explore the full extent of a solid stimulus, the estimation of an unfilled distance requires that both endpoints be inspected before the task can be attempted at all. The attentional cueing implicit in distance estimation tasks might thus account for their superior performance by neglect patients. We report two bisection studies that address this issue. The first confirmed, amongst patients with left visual neglect, a reliable reduction of rightward error for <b>unfilled</b> <b>gap</b> stimuli as compared with solid lines. The second study assessed the cause of this reduction, deconfounding the effects of stimulus type (lines vs. gaps) and attentional cueing, by applying an explicit cueing manipulation to line and gap bisection tasks. Under these matched cueing conditions, all patients performed similarly on line and gap bisection tasks, suggesting that the reduction of neglect typically observed for gap stimuli may be attributable entirely to cueing effects. We found no evidence that a spatial extent, once fully attended, is judged any differently according to whether it is filled or unfilled...|$|E
40|$|Neglect {{patients}} generally fail {{to respond}} appropriately toward stimuli {{located in the}} contralesional space and may ignore stimuli or reduce the extent eye and hand movement to objects occurring within this space. Thus, systematic spatial biases in the visually guided actions were observed for patients with right-hemisphere damage. As it was found in previous studies, {{in addition to the}} behavioral response, it is important to monitor the eye behavior during a visual search task to analyze the difficulties related to the exploration of the visual space by neglect patients. The present study analyzed behavioral and eye-movement measures in unilateral neglect patients in response to online bisection task (<b>unfilled</b> <b>gap</b> lines). Two different tasks were used to test the bisection performance, a pointing and a grasping strategy. Indeed, we hypothesized that neglect patients may be more directly impaired in task execution (online bisection) in case of pointing than of grasping strategy. Therefore, it was explored whether these different strategies may influence subjects’ behavioral and eye-movement measures. Secondly, segment length (from shorter to longer) and its spatial position (from right to left spatial location) were monitored, to verify the consistency of rightward bias increasing as a function of left-side more than right-side dislocation and of longer more than shorter segments. Eleven neglect patients and ten control subjects were included into the study. The subjects could give their response pointing the perceived midpoint starting from stimuli onset (pointing condition). In the grasping condition, subjects were required to imagine they had to grasp an object localized on the midpoint of the segment, instead of only perceptually visualize and point the midline of the segment itself. Eye movements were recorded using an infrared-based video tracking (Tobii X 120), including the total number of fixations, fixations length, and direction of the first fixations during bisection task execution. Consistent spatial biases were found for both bisection responses, fixation count, and duration, {{as well as for the}} first fixation count in case of pointing task. The spatial gradient effect was found only in response to specific ‘‘leftward’’ positions. In addition, bisection task was affected by the cognitive strategy of patients, with a more consistent rightward response bias in case of a representation finalized to pointing more than grasping. Eye-movement behavior supported and confirmed this behavioral trend. An ‘‘extreme-left’’ gradient effect was suggested and discussed, with patients’ behavioral and eye measures more impaired. On the contrary, the patients’ performance was similar to the controls’ one in case the grasping task. The direct link of visual pointing and grasping strategy with two distinct cortical pathways was adduced to explain these results...|$|E

These are: the {{classification}} and functional analysis of aspects of their behaviour, examining feeding preferences in relation to land management, finding how literary attitudes towards them developed and obtaining quantitative insights into their past distribution to apply to possible explanations for their status changes. Three pairs near Llangranog, Dyfed were observed and findings were complemented with analysis of RSPB film offcuts. All observed behaviours were defined and classified according to social context and frequency of use. Of 45 behaviours seen, 21 had not previously been recorded. Single-link cluster diagrams were presented to illustrate observed postures and comparable corvid postures. Three aspects of their social behaviour were further examined: Food-begging by juveniles and females was related to time since fledging and copulation date respectively. Begging success depended on technique repertoire, which increased with time; increased foraging group size decreased the individual's vigilance time spent, with an earlier detection of potential tourist disturbance; wing-flicking did not occur with short flights nor after flights due to disturbance. It was frequent after landing while as frequent before take-off as during foraging excepting tourist disturbed flights. Ritualised forms of wing-flicking and bill-wiping {{formed the basis of}} Chough communication. Flow diagrams and canal models describing the functional organisation of these behaviours are presented. Choughs feed on short, mainly grass swards maintained by grazing, exposure and occasionally, cutting. When given the Jackdaw's old name, Choughs acquired their thieving reputation and were also regarded as fire-raisers until the 1830 's.

Intentionality has shared a similar role, such that one and the other have often been brought together in a symbiotic relationship (Searle 1990) or deemed coextensive (Crane 1998). Such promiscuity is not necessary. The revolution brought about by embodied and situated approaches seem to leave little place for such an association. Intentionality is seldom studied in the new paradigm, and when it is, new models of it are applicable to biological and robotic structures which, by most accounts, probably have no consciousness (Millikan 1984, Menary 2006). Menary (2009) also notes that the same could be said of scholastic accounts of intentionality. On the other hand, consciousness is being studied and various ways which do not involve intentionality or anything similar. I suggest that the association between these two notions has to do with the particular intellectual environment that prevailed in traditional philosophy of mind. Considerations about access and the good fortune of cognitivism, among other factors, made for a culture that emphasized the gap between behaviour on one hand and the the mental states that characterize us when we are in a disposition to cause behaviour on the other. In such conditions, concepts like intentionality and consciousness acted as bridge and allowed for a language which enabled accounts of the mind that remained somewhat comprehensive and unified, while leaving the <b>gap</b> <b>unfilled.</b> As they were covering the most problematic and elusive parts of our understanding of the mind, there was both enough similarity in the ways we used those concepts, and enough vagueness in how we accounted for their realization in physical systems, to make a rapprochement inevitable. When a new paradigm swept away the cognitivist conception of representation, some philosophers and cognitive scientists turned to more embodied and situated models of cognition. Representations in this paradigm (such as Millikan’s (1995) and Clark’s (1997)) are “action-oriented”, thus leaving no gap between action and representation – getting an account of the complex representations that we communicate in propositions is thus seen as a matter of empirical investigation. If there is no gap, concepts like intentionality and consciousness are called to play different roles in accounts of the mind – roles which do not permit any confusion. The poster will highlight relevant differences in the philosophical climate as they project themselves in accounts of representation (following Gallagher 2008), and make salient the link between this climate and the role of cognition in philosophy of mind...|$|R
40|$|The {{appearance}} of chairs, {{and the way}} we sit haven’t really changed since centuries, despite developments in our lifestyle in the past one and a half century. Increasingly more people spend increasingly more time sitting unhealthily. The chair simply has not kept up with these developments and the new demands generated by them. There are still some very fundamental (ergonomic) problems with sitting, since it is not a natural position: it is indeed a paradox that the usage of conventional chairs still keeps increasing. This phenomena raises the question why still should we use these chairs if we have alternatives? The alternatives offer healthier position on the long run but only for a narrow group of people: in general we can say that we gain a more healthy position, but we lose the general usability. For example the kneeling chair puts unbearable stress on the knees for elderly people, or the saddle-chair is not usable with short skirt, etc. There are situations however where many different people have to be seated {{at the same time and}} these alternative solutions can not offer acceptable accommodation for all. Virtually we have two extremes, the conventional chair, characterized by general usability, but not particularly good for anyone and the alternative solutions, which while very favorable for a particular group, exclude others. Currently there is no gradual transition between the two, it is truly a black and white situation. This is where I see an <b>unfilled</b> <b>gap</b> even though the demand exists: there are several situations, spaces (e. g. waiting areas, auditoriums, restaurants, cafeteria) where general usability and a more healthy position would be beneficial. With my degree project I am exploring what is between the two extremes: what can be the gray between the black and the white? I am searching for the delicate balance and the right compromise between the two. The main aim of this degree project is to overcome this schism and offer ideas which could mean the way forward in seating design. The end result is a chair built on and mergeing the experiences accumulated in the field of sitting, which necessitated a comprehensive analysis of the already existing solutions. But this project points further than just a thesis topic, it holds much more potential. My goal was to create a framework of principles for myself which I can use as a guideline in the future as well, as the issues uncovered here are generally true and valid for a long time. They can form a solid basis for any future designs as comfort and usage should be an implicit starting point of any object...|$|E
