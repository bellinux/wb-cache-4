In addition, threats to degradation (rust) of the steel components is a possibility if air voids are left in the original construction, due to too dry a mixture of the concrete being applied, or not forcing {{the air out of}} the structure while it is in its wet stage of construction, through vibration, pressurized spraying techniques, or other means. These air voids can turn to pools of water as the cured material absorbs moisture.

To resolve wear and corrosion issues, the hard iron boride-based coatings on steels obtained through the thermal diffusion process can be applied on the entire working surfaces of large size and complex shape products. The behavior of these coatings obtained at Endurance Technologies Inc. has been studied in the friction-abrasion, friction-corrosion and friction-abrasion-corrosion conditions simulating oil production service conditions. Tribological {{studies have been conducted}} using the "rod-on-flat" reciprocating sliding method in the conditions simulating actual application conditions. The synergistic actions of harsh conditions results in a higher rate of materials destruction. The obtained iron boride coatings demonstrated significantly lower wear losses with no delamination and spalling than <b>untreated</b> <b>steels</b> and Ni- and Cr-based coatings. The encouraging tribo-corrosion test results for boride coatings are explained by their high hardness and chemical inertness, specific structure obtained through the thermal diffusion process with reduced micro-crack propagation and the thin "tribofilm" formed during a friction mode. Successful application of the products with the boride protective coatings is reported. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

The surface hardness of the treated and <b>untreated</b> <b>steels</b> was studied using depth sensing ultra microindentation system (UMIS). It is shown that the hardness of nitrogen ion implanted steel samples varied from 35 to 50 GPa depending on the implantation conditions and the doses of the N 2 + implantation. These hardness values were higher than those previously published for ion implanted tool steels. The surfaces of the treated samples were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

The combination of evidences from nano-indentation and XPS, points towards possible formation of silicon carbo-nitride in a suspected (C,Si) xNy stoichiometry.

40|$|Structural alloys for Generation-IV nuclear {{reactors}} need to endure a high neutron dose, high temperature, and corrosive coolant. Austenitic stainless steels, particularly the oxide-dispersion-strengthened (ODS) austenitic steels, are promising candidate materials, but they suffer several limits such as irradiation damage and {{stress corrosion cracking}} (SCC). This research applies a laser shock peening (LSP) process to improve the radiation and SCC resistance of austenitic stainless steels in simulated nuclear reactor environments. A high density dislocation networks, stacking faults and twin boundaries were generated in the surface region of 304 steels by the shock wave-material interactions in the LSP process. In-situ TEM irradiation experiments suggest that laser-peened 304 steels suffer less radiation damage than the untreated samples because the generated dislocation networks and twin boundaries serve as sinks for the annihilation of irradiation defects.

40|$|Most {{low alloy}} steels are {{tempered}} at relatively low temperatures, limiting the opportunities for improving their wear resistance and surface hardness by traditional heat treatment processes. In this work, we use plasma immersion ion implantation (PI 3) to apply a hybrid ion implantation/thermochemical diffusion treatment to ball bearing steel 100 Cr 6 (1 % C, 1. 5 % Cr). By a judicious choice of implantation voltage, temperature and time, {{it is possible to}} combine the PI 3 treatment with the tempering stage of heat treatment, without compromising the hardness of the alloy. Up to 200 &# 0176;C, the bulk hardness (750 HV tempered) of the material is maintained, and nitrogen implantation increases the surface hardness due to the precipitation of fine Fe 2 N. At 300 &# 0176;C, where enhanced nitrogen and carbon diffusion can occur, the bulk hardness decreases, although in many applications this can be compensated by the increase in surface hardness to around 900 HV 0. 1 due to Fe 3 N and Fe 4 N formation.

Average lateral size of nano-features less than 60 nm (after heating) were shown to favor mainly the carbon nanotube growth while a larger features size was associated predominantly to the carbon nanofiber synthesis. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy observations suggest two different mechanisms for nanotube/nanofiber growth: (1) base growth mode caused by nanosized hills on the surface catalyzing the nanotube/nanofiber synthesis, (2) tip growth mode requiring substrate surface break-up as a preliminary step to form catalytic particles, with similarities to the ‘‘metal dusting’’ mechanisms.

X-ray diffraction analyses revealed the presence of both γ′ (Fe 4 N) and ε (Fe 2 – 3 N) nitrides with a predominance of the ε phase. Moreover, α-Fe (110), γ′ and ε diffraction peaks were shifted to lower angles suggesting the development of compressive stresses in the post nitrided steel. As a result, it was shown that nitriding allowed a significant hardening of steel with hardness values higher than 1200 HV. The diffusion layers were always composed of an outer compound layer and a hardened bulk layer which thickness was half of the total diffusion layer one. No white layer was observed. Similarly, no traces of chromium nitrides were detected. The temperature seemed to be a parameter more influent than the process duration on the morphological properties of the nitrided layer, while it had no real influence on their crystallinity. Finally, the optimal nitriding conditions to obtain a thick and hard diffusion layer are 500 °C for 10 h. On the other hand, to verify the effect of these parameters on the corrosion resistance, potentiodynamic polarization tests were carried out in an original “wood juice” electrolyte. After corrosion, surface was then observed at the SEM scale. Electrochemical study indicated that the <b>untreated</b> <b>steel</b> behaved as a passive material. Although the very noble character of steel was somewhat mitigated and the corrosion propensity increased for nitrided steels, the passive-like nature of themodified surfacewas preserved. For the same optimized parameters as those deduced from the mechanical characterization (500 °C, 10 h), surface presented, in addition to a huge surface hardening, a high corrosion resistance.

40|$|Summary This study {{assessed}} the edge cutting efficiency of three new curettes with different edge retention echnologies after simulated wear in vitro. Three test curettes (two with a titanium nitride coating and one without coating, but {{made of a}} cryogenically treated stainless steel alloy) were used to root plane prepared bovine dentin specimens. Nine curettes of each type were used to instrument one dentin sample each. Dentin removal was determined after the first ten strokes and again cumulatively for the strokes 500 – 510 and 1, 000 – 1, 010 by means of atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). The effects of chemical and thermal stress were analysed after repeated disinfection and sterilization of the instruments then followed by a final 10 -stroke sequence of dentin removal to determine cutting efficacy. A standard, <b>untreated</b> stainless <b>steel</b> curette {{was used as a}} control. Test and control instruments showed no statistical evidence of diminished dentin removal over 1010 strokes. Dentin surface roughness also displayed insignificant differences for all instruments. However, sterilization negatively affected the test and control instruments to an equal degree. Sterilization procedures appear to be an important factor in the dulling of curettes, which affected dentin removal efficacy but not surface roughness...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{ultrasonic}} treatment (UST) on the solidification microstructure of a 35 CrMo steel cast ingot were investigated. To avoid {{the erosion of}} a high-temperature melt, a T-shaped ultrasonic waveguide unit was used to introduce ultrasonic vibrations into a 35 CrMo steel die casting melt. The experimental {{results show that the}} microstructure of the ingot was refined by ultrasonic treatment. While the microstructure of <b>untreated</b> 35 CrMo <b>steel</b> is coarse dendritic grains, after the introduction of ultrasonic treatment, the solidification microstructure transforms from coarse dendritic to equiaxed grains, and the dendrites are also refined. Samples from different positions of the ingots were subjected to different ultrasonic effects, and the effects on grain refinement also varied due to the severe attenuation of the ultrasound in the melt. The mechanisms of grain refinement using ultrasonic treatment for 35 CrMo steel melt are presented...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Q 195 steel {{was treated}} with titanizing {{followed}} plasma nitriding by glow plasma alloying technology using single pulse power supply. The corrosion resistances of titanizing sample and titanizing + ion nitrided sample were studied. The {{results show that the}} alloying layer is 200 µm in depth and organization is α-Fe solid solution containing Ti by plasma titanizing technology using single pulse power supply. An obvious reactive diffusion dividing line formed between alloying layer and the substrate. It shows that diffusion phenomenon happened in process of titanizing. The morphology of Ti alloy layer was columnar crystals. The content of Ti on the surface is up to 5 wt%. And the Ti content of alloying layer is in a decreasing from the surface to the inner on a gradient distribution. The phase structure of titanizing layer is composed of Fe 2 Ti, Fe-Ti and TiC phases. The phase structure of titanizing + ion nitrided sample was obviously TiN phase and a few Fe-Ti phase. The surface hardness of <b>untreated</b> carbon <b>steel</b> is 110 HV and that of the alloying layer of titanizing is 310 HV. The surface hardness of titanizing + ion nitrided sample is 1800 HV. The corrosion resistance of titanizing sample is increased 12. 15 times compared with the untreated sample and 1. 42 times compared with 18 - 8 stainless steel in H 2 SO 4 solution; The corrosion resistance of titanizing + ion nitrided sample is increased 7. 444 times compared with the untreated sample and as well as 18 - 8 stainless steel in H 2 SO 4 solution...|$|R
