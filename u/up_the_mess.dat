5|$|During {{the second}} verse, {{it has the}} {{spacecraft}} traveling past the moon, whilst Utada cleans <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>mess</b> the passengers left on their tables. By the second pre-chorus, several passengers play ping pong, as Utada exercises.

5|$|Model {{spent the}} first year of World War II as a chief of staff, first of IV Corps during the {{invasion}} of Poland, and then of Sixteenth Army during the Battle of France. He was promoted to lieutenant general (Generalleutnant) in April 1940, and earned his first senior command posting in November that year, when he was assigned to lead the 3rd Panzer Division. He immediately proceeded to ignore all formalities of organization and command, which endeared him to his men and exasperated his staff—who often had to clean <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>mess</b> he left behind. He also instituted a combined arms training programme where his men were thrown together in various ad-hoc groupings regardless of their parent unit: tankers would train with infantry, engineers with recon units, and so on. Model thus anticipated by some months the regular German use of Kampfgruppen in World War II. While this would become routine later on, it was still not a universal practice in the Wehrmacht in late 1940 and early 1941.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Jason Wade in the driver's {{seat of a}} car, with {{the other members of}} Lifehouse in the car with him. The traffic is at a stand still in a tunnel, as a swarm of people have {{abandoned}} their vehicles and are walking through. Wade and the band members get out of the car, and begin walking in the opposite direction of the crowd {{to the other side of}} the tunnel. Wade pushes through the people, who are in a rush to get to the entrance of the tunnel and is constantly focused on his destination to get to the end. When he reaches the tunnel's end, he sees the wreckage of a car crash with firefighters and paramedics cleaning <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>mess.</b> Wade then sees a girl observing what appears to be herself, dead inside one of the crashed car. He then looks to the left, and sees an old man observing himself, dead on the ground. As Wade looks into the other car, he sees himself, also seemingly dead. Upon this, Wade frantically runs back into the tunnel towards his car. Then he sees himself in the car with the band members, however everyone seems to be frozen as he bangs on the windows. Suddenly Wade is inside the car again, and a police officer comes to the window, motioning him to continue driving, since he is stopped in the middle of the tunnel for no apparent reason.|$|E

50|$|Jordan quickly {{comes to}} {{understand}} that Sinestro's beliefs are not in line {{with those of the}} Guardians: Sinestro believes that the Guardians have reduced the Corps to merely picking <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>messes</b> criminals create as opposed to proactively dealing with the problem. During a mission to capture Kanjar Ro, Jordan is knocked unconscious by Kanjar's energy staff. Sinestro comes in and kills Kanjar, pinning the blame on Jordan.

25|$|Three legends {{explain the}} {{formation}} of the Chocolate Hills. The first tells the story of two feuding giants who hurled rocks, boulders, and sand at each other.

40|$|Biotechnology is “the {{integration}} of natural sciences and engineering {{in order to}} achieve the application of organisms, cells, parts thereof and molecular analogues for products and services”. Biotechnology, for more than a century, has acted as a vital buffer between people, pollution and the environment. The ever-increasing stresses we impose upon the world’s ecosystems mean that this field is becoming ever more important. It may be that biotechnology will not only be able to help clean <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>messes</b> that we inflict on the Mother Earth, but also prevent them ever happening in the first place...|$|R

25|$|Edgar Montrose (Graham Greene) is Possum Lodge's {{explosives}} enthusiast. He {{believes that}} any problem (including leaky roofs and invasive weeds) {{can be solved}} with explosives. He is usually seen wearing singed overalls, a cracked construction helmet {{and a pair of}} ear protectors, though he rarely covers his ears with them. According to himself, Edgar was born in Assiniboia, Saskatchewan, and he started using explosives at a young age.

25|$|When {{the film}} was {{released}} on the televised network ABC on February 23, 1975, a {{four and a half}} minute prologue was added to the film to contextualise the character and justify the violence. Written and directed by Monte Hellman, it featured an unidentified official (Harry Dean Stanton) offering the Man With No Name a chance at a pardon in exchange for cleaning <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>mess</b> in San Miguel. Close-ups of Eastwood's face from archival footage are inserted into the scene alongside Stanton's performance.

25|$|During November 2007, Eduardo Maruri {{was elected}} President of Barcelona for the 2007–11 period. Maruri and Noboa (Barcelona's Vice President) {{introduced}} the slogan La Renovación (The Renovation), thereby promising {{to bring in}} key international players {{as well as the}} best Ecuadorian players and to clean <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>mess</b> that had prevented Barcelona from winning the national title. However, the 2009 season was Barcelona's worst season in its history in the Serie A. Such teams as Deportivo Quito, ESPOLI, Deportivo Cuenca and LDU Portoviejo came out and spoke about their concern: if Barcelona were relegated, it would enormously impact those teams' economic situations, since when they would play at home against Barcelona it would almost guarantee a sell-out. (This was because Barcelona had the most fans of any team in Ecuador.) On October 3, 2009, more than 70,000 fans showed up at the Estadio Monumental Banco del Pichincha to support El Idolo del Ecuador so {{that it would not be}} relegated to the Serie B. In an intense match, Barcelona defeated LDU Portoviejo 2–0 with goals from José Luis Perlaza (46th minute) and Juan Samudio (90th minute). This allowed Barcelona to remain the only Ecuadorian team that has never played a game in Serie B.|$|E
25|$|The Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo came in 1932. In 1934, Houston Junior College {{became a}} {{four-year}} institution and {{changed its name}} to the University of Houston. A flood in 1935 suddenly turned conditions for the worst, and Houstonians were forced to clean <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>mess.</b> Air service by Braniff Airways and Eastern Air Lines came in 1935 and 1936. By the end of the decade, Houston was encountering growth pains, as the city had inadequate air service and that it was no longer a frontier town. Houston became the largest city in Texas in terms of population in 1939. Many immigrants and African-Americans from Louisiana and other parts of Texas moved to the city to find education or work. The city obtained a very multicultural atmosphere, with large African-American and immigrant communities scattered about. However, African-Americans faced bad housing and poor jobs during this time period. Nevertheless, African-American society developed so much that the city was, and still is, the African-American capital of Texas. The University of Houston moved to its present-day location donated by the Cullen family off of what would later be the first freeway in Houston, U.S. Highway 75 (now called Interstate 45), or Gulf Freeway.|$|E
