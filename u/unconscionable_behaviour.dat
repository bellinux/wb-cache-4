Before 1875, the common law courts only allowed escape from an agreement and damages if someone was induced to enter an agreement by fraud or was put under physical duress, or suffered {{from a lack of}} legal capacity. The courts of equity, however, were significantly more generous because they allowed [...] "rescission" [...] (i.e. cancellation) of a contract if a person was the victim of any misrepresentation, even an innocent one, and any [...] "undue influence", beyond influence by physical threats. In these situations the victim of the misrepresentation or <b>unconscionable</b> <b>behaviour</b> has the option to avoid the contract. If avoided, the parties are both entitled to have returned whatever property they had already conveyed, so nobody remains unjustly enriched (though this terminology was not used till the 20th century). As the 20th century unfolded, the courts and statute expanded on the range of circumstances in which a person could claim damages for negligent misrepresentation, on top of fraud. As concern over the use of unfair terms grew, there were calls to recognise a positive duty on contracting parties to disclose material facts {{as part of a broader}} duty of [...] "good faith" [...] and some judges attempted to follow the American Uniform Commercial Code by fashioning a broader doctrine of [...] "unconscionable" [...] bargains, procured through inequality of bargaining power. This development was, however, stopped by the House of Lords, so that problems of unfair contract terms continued to be dealt with through targeted legislation. The courts also declare contracts void if they were for an illegal purpose, and refuse to enforce the agreement, or give any legal remedy if doing so would require a person to rely on their illegal act.|$|E
50|$|The FUD tactic {{was used}} by Caltex Australia in 2003. According to an {{internal}} memo, which was subsequently leaked, they wished to use FUD to destabilise franchisee confidence, and thus get a better deal for Caltex. This memo {{was used as an}} example of <b>unconscionable</b> <b>behaviour</b> in a Senate inquiry. Senior management claimed that it was contrary to and did not reflect company principles.|$|E
50|$|Latec Investments Ltd v Hotel Terrigal Pty Ltd {{establishes}} that, in New South Wales, {{there are}} 3 classes of equitable interests: equitable interest, mere equity and personal equity. Mere equity, for example, may arise when one {{party has been}} unjustly disadvantaged by the <b>unconscionable</b> <b>behaviour</b> of another. Importantly, however, a ‘mere equity’ will not prevail over an actual bona fide equitable interest - such as an equitable charge.|$|E
5000|$|... the {{ingredients}} for a proprietary estoppel should include, in principle, a proprietary claim made by a claimant and {{an answer to that}} claim based on some fact, or point of mixed fact and law, which the person against whom the claim was made could be estopped from asserting. To treat a [...] "proprietary estoppel equity" [...] as requiring simply <b>unconscionable</b> <b>behaviour</b> was a recipe for confusion. The remedy to which, on the facts as found by the judge, the claimant was entitled could be described neither as based on an estoppel nor as proprietary in character. His Lordship's present view was that proprietary estoppel could not be prayed in aid to render enforceable an agreement declared by statute (s. 2 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989) to be void. A claim for the imposition of a constructive trust to provide a remedy for a disappointed expectation engendered by a representation made in the course of incomplete contractual negotiations was misconceived and could not be sustained by reliance on <b>unconscionable</b> <b>behaviour.</b> The claimant was, however, entitled to a quantum meruit payment for his services in obtaining the planning permission.|$|E
50|$|The High Court {{held that}} to avoid {{detriment}} through Waltons' <b>unconscionable</b> <b>behaviour,</b> Waltons was estopped from denying the contract. Whilst the mere exercise of legal {{right not to}} exchange contracts was not unconscionable, there were two additional elements which made Waltons' conduct unconscionable: a) element of urgency, b) Maher executed and forwarded on 11/11 and assumed execution by Walton was a formality. The award (though very similar to an expectation interest, {{as if it were}} a contract that was enforced) was only meant to cover reliance. Because Maher had acted to his detriment, in reliance on the encouragement of Walton Stores, which had acted unconscionably, equity would intervene.|$|E

State security agents reacted with teargas and gunfire. 50 people died and about 550 houses were destroyed.The April 2003 national elections were marked by serious violence and intimidation in the Etche LGA, seriously compromising the free voters process.In a 2007 report, Human Rights Watch said that [...] "in recent years Etche has earned a degree of unwelcome notoriety due to allegations of corruption, thuggery and murder leveled against its current chairman." [...] The report stated that health and education facilities were in an advanced state of physical decay, with funds allocated for staffing and renovation being diverted for other purposes.In January 2009 the Etche legislative council impeached three of their members for [...] "irrational and <b>unconscionable</b> <b>behaviour,</b> gross misconduct, misappropriation of legislative fund and abuse of office." ...|$|E

40|$|Many Holocaust {{scholars}} {{subscribe to}} the theory that under the unimaginable stress of Holocaust persecution Jewish victims found that, in extremis, conventional morality did not apply. On {{the basis of an}} analysis of a sample of videotestimonies held in the Jewish Holocaust Museum and Research Centre in Melbourne, Australia (hereafter the JHMRC), this article argues that such assumptions require revision. Despite observing numerous instances of <b>unconscionable</b> <b>behaviour,</b> in these videotestimonies survivors provide many examples of their own ethical practices and those of others. <br /...|$|E
40|$|This article {{argues that}} the object of {{rectification}} for unilateral mistake ought to be essentially no different than rectification for common mistake - namely, {{to ensure that the}} written contract reflects the true bargain between the parties as determined by ordinary principles of contract formation. Proof dishonesty or <b>unconscionable</b> <b>behaviour</b> prior to entry into the contract should not be the basis of the claim. A party who is mistaken as to the terms expressed in a written contract ought to be granted rectification whenever he or she has been led reasonably to believe that the document does in fact contain the terms intended, regardless of whether the other party shares the mistake, knows of it, or behaved badly in some way...|$|E
40|$|At the Heysel Stadium in Brussels in 1985, 39 Juventus {{supporters}} were killed, {{primarily as a}} consequence of a charge by drunken opposition fans. Four years later, at Hillsborough, Sheffield, {{more than twice as many}} spectators were crushed to death, primarily as a result of police contempt for the hooligan minority. That both tragedies involved Liverpool followers - 96 of whom died at Hillsborough - is the unhappiest, most divisive, most problematic of coincidences. Yet while it would be naïve, at best, to deny any other connection, the long-running inquiry into the Hillsborough tragedy has bred denial about Heysel, and not exclusively among Liverpool supporters. Further hampered by the reluctance of Juventus to desecrate the club's first European Cup final triumph by reopening old wounds, debate has been stifled. To suggest that the fatal charge at Heysel might have contributed to the <b>unconscionable</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the police at Hillsborough, or that the fences that contributed so heavily to the deaths would not have been there but for pitch invasions, is to wade into toxic waters. Written to commemorate the 30 th anniversary of the Heysel tragedy, this paper investigates the various ‘truths', interviews witnesses and addresses the inherent contradictions of ‘The Tragedy That Dare Not Speak Its Name'...|$|E
