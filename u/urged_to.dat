40|$|Background and aims: The {{behavioural}} addiction {{model of}} obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) proposes that as compulsions successfully reduce obsession-provoked anxiety {{in the early}} stages of the disorder, their performance is rewarding and therefore potentially addictive. According to this theory, the <b>urge</b> <b>to</b> perform a compulsion or neutralization resembles craving in addiction, and ventral fronto-striatal reward circuitry is activated during compulsive or neutralizing behaviour, resembling substance addiction disorders. The current study used EEG source localisation to test this hypothesis by examining brain activity accompanying the <b>urge</b> <b>to</b> neutralize and covert neutralization. Methods: Two groups of non-clinical participants (15 Low-OC, 15 High-OC) performed a task in which the <b>urge</b> <b>to</b> neutralize was induced by supplying participants with an obsessive-compulsive-like thought. Source localised EEG activity was compared between a negative condition with high <b>urge</b> <b>to</b> neutralize, and a positive condition with low <b>urge</b> <b>to</b> neutralize, and correlations between brain activity and self-reported <b>urge</b> <b>to</b> neutralize were examined. Results: High-OC participants reported a significantly greater <b>urge</b> <b>to</b> neutralize than Low-OC participants, and the majority of participants reported performing covert neutralization during the experiment. Between-condition comparisons in the High-OC group revealed significantly greater alpha activity in the insula and vlPFC in the negative than the positive condition, which was significantly correlated with both <b>urge</b> <b>to</b> neutralize and later decrease in negative affect. Conclusions: The current results support the proposal that the <b>urge</b> <b>to</b> neutralize in OCD is neurally similar to craving in substance addiction, in agreement with the behavioural addiction model of OCD. ...|$|R

5|$|After {{retiring}} from the post of Superior General of the Holy Ghost Fathers, Lefebvre was approached by traditionalists from the French Seminary in Rome who had been refused tonsure, the rite by which, until 1973, a seminarian became a cleric.

After directing them to the University of Fribourg, Switzerland, Lefebvre was <b>urged</b> <b>to</b> teach these seminarians personally. In 1969, he received permission from the local bishop to establish a seminary in Fribourg which opened with nine students, moving to Écône, Switzerland in 1971.|$|E

40|$|There is now strong {{evidence}} that exercise has an acute effect on the <b>urge</b> <b>to</b> smoke and the accompanying withdrawal symptoms. However, the perceptions by heavy smokers of exercise and its relationship <b>to</b> the <b>urge</b> <b>to</b> smoke have not been well documented. The aim {{of the present study}} is to understand the experiences of heavy smokers with regard to exercise and its effect on their <b>urge</b> <b>to</b> smoke. Five physically inactive, heavy smokers are asked to abstain from smoking the night before exercising on a cycle ergometer under two conditions (one at medium and one at vigorous intensity done a week apart). Semi-structured, in-depth interviews are conducted after the second exercise session. Thematic analysis reveals six themes describing the participants’ experience of exercise, <b>urge</b> <b>to</b> smoke, exercise preferences, exercise and smoking relationship, exercise as an aid to quit smoking, and the effects of the experimental procedure. Overall, the participants’ experiences support the existing literature, which has posited affective, biological, and cognitive mechanisms contributing to a delay in the <b>urge</b> <b>to</b> smoke after exercise. The main findings pertain to: (1) the “feel-good” effect after exercise as a relief from the “feel-bad” effect during exercise; (2) the decreased <b>urge</b> <b>to</b> smoke after exercise, stated by all participants regardless of reported positive and negative feelings; and (3) exercise as a “clearing the mind” mechanism rather than an attention-distracting mechanism...|$|R
5|$|As Cimaron emerged {{over the}} South China Sea, {{officials}} in Vietnam began preparing for possible {{effects from the}} storm. Authorities began evacuating residents in flood-prone areas along the coast from Quảng Bình Khánh Hòa, including 12,500 in Thừa Thiên–Huế Province. Fishermen were <b>urged</b> <b>to</b> seek shelter at nearby ports until the storm subsided. The Vietnamese Government also requested the deployment of the nation's Army, Coast Guard, and Navy to assist in evacuation efforts. Residents still recovering from Typhoon Xangsane in early October were forced to secure their homes and evacuate once again. An estimated 218,000people were planned to be relocated across Vietnam: 68,000 in Quảng Nam, 60,000 in Quảng Trị, 50,000 in Thừa Thiên–Huế, and 40,000 in Quảng Bình. Appeals were made to roughly 3,500vessels, with a collective crew count of 32,285, to return to port. The Navy deployed 42ships for possible search and rescue missions. Following Cimaron's change in course and cessation of movement, the Vietnamese Government suspended all evacuation plans on November2; however, fishermen were <b>urged</b> <b>to</b> remain at port in fears of repeating the incidents during Typhoon Chanchu in May of that year where over 200fishermen lost their lives.|$|E
5|$|By October28, Isabela, {{southern}} Cagayan, Quirino, {{and northern}} Aurora provinces were placed under Public Storm Warning Signal (PSWS) #3, the second-highest level. More than 20provinces overall were placed under varying PSWS levels. Residents living {{along the coast}} were <b>urged</b> <b>to</b> evacuate. Early on October29, several provinces along Luzon's east coast were placed under PSWS #4, {{the highest level of}} alert. During a national radio broadcast President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo urged residents to heed warnings and not to venture out during the storm. Throughout Luzon, schools and government offices were closed on October29 while residents in mountainous areas were <b>urged</b> <b>to</b> evacuate due to threat of mudslides. The National Transmission Corporation deployed power restoration crews across the region to allow for quick post-storm response. Hospitals in Cimaron's projected path requested employees to be present in anticipation of an influx of patients. Quick response teams from the Department of Social Welfare and Development were placed on standby for possible deployment. Within evacuation areas, the Philippine National Police was dispatched to prevent people from returning to these areas. Bus companies suspended all services north of Tarlac City and San Jose.|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} {{investigated}} whether negative mood alone, or {{in conjunction with}} exposure to food cues, influences the <b>urge</b> <b>to</b> eat. Female participants (N = 160) were allocated to either a negative or neutral mood induction procedure followed by exposure to either a preferred food cue or a non-food cue. Participants reported their <b>urge</b> <b>to</b> eat at baseline, following the mood induction procedure, and following the cue exposure, as well as completing measures of restrained and disinhibited eating. Contrary <b>to</b> prediction, <b>urge</b> <b>to</b> eat decreased following the mood induction procedure {{for those in the}} negative mood condition. This was not influenced by eating style (i. e., restrained or disinhibited eaters). <b>Urge</b> <b>to</b> eat subsequently increased following exposure to the food, but not the non-food, cue. This effect was moderated by negative mood and eating style with disinhibited eating being positively associated with <b>urge</b> <b>to</b> eat for those women in the negative mood condition. These findings suggest that negative mood plays a role in the tendency to overeat, but only in the context of personally desirable food cues and for a subgroup of women with a history of disinhibited eating.
