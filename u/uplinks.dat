40|$|The {{limiting}} {{factor in the}} <b>uplink</b> of all CDMA cellular systems is the relation between <b>uplink</b> noise rise and intended coverage. In link budgets, noise rise is usually simply handled as a constant contribution to the background noise in logarithmic scale, {{often referred to as}} interference margin. In practice, however, it is not constant. We model the <b>uplink</b> noise rise as a lognormal distribution, and investigate the impact to link budgets. Simulations and numerical calculations show that the <b>uplink</b> noise rise variance does not critically affect the <b>uplink</b> capacity and coverage. System feasibility and its relation to the <b>uplink</b> load is also discussed. It is shown that approximative load expressions provides an upper bound on the <b>uplink</b> load and therefore they can be used to imply system feasibility. Furthermore, the <b>uplink</b> load expressions provide accurate approximations of the load given that the load is within the practical limits given by the link budgets...|$|R

40|$|WiMAX {{networks}} experience sporadic congestion on <b>uplink</b> when applications {{running at}} subscriber stations need more bandwidth to transmit than allocated. With the fast proliferation of mobile Internet, the wireless {{community has been}} looking for a framework that can address the issue of impediment on <b>uplink.</b> Due to asymmetric behavior of Internet applications downlink sub-frame is expected to have longer duration as compared to <b>uplink.</b> According to IEEE 806. 16 standard for WiMAX the segmentation of TDD frame between <b>uplink</b> and downlink can be dynamically redefined even at runtime. Research contributions so far lack in addressing an optimal strategy for readjustment of <b>uplink</b> and downlink sub-frame boundaries; based on traffic statistics. In this paper, we introduce a mechanism that allows <b>uplink</b> sub-frame to grow, borrowing resources from the downlink sub-frame, if the <b>uplink</b> utilization is high and the downlink is being underutilized. We present here, a framework to dynamically demarcate the TDD frame-duration between <b>uplink</b> and downlink. Proposed algorithm takes into account the present utilization of downlink and reallocates a certain quantum of free resources to <b>uplink.</b> This occurs when <b>uplink</b> observes shortage of bandwidth to transmit. We simulate some test scenarios using OPNET Modeler with and without dynamic reallocation capability. The results of our simulation confirm the effectiveness of proposed algorithm which observes a remarkable decrease in end-to-end packet delay. Also, we observe an improvement in throughput at <b>uplink</b> such that, the performance of downlink remains unaffected...|$|R
