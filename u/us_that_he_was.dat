25|$|Traditional biographies, {{including}} the Vita Iuvenalis, {{give us the}} writer's full name and also tell <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> either the son, or adopted son, of a rich freedman. He {{is supposed to have}} been a pupil of Quintilian, and to have practised rhetoric until he was middle-aged, both as amusement and for legal purposes. The Satires do make frequent and accurate references to the operation of the Roman legal system. His career as a satirist is supposed to have begun at a fairly late stage in his life.|$|E

[...] "I was calling for things only a {{beginner}} would have been ignorant enough to think anybody could ever do, and there he was, doing them." [...] Toland later explained {{that he wanted to}} work with Welles because he anticipated the first time director's inexperience and reputation for audacious experimentation in the theater would allow the cinematographer to try new and innovative camera techniques that typical Hollywood films would never have allowed him to do. Unaware of filmmaking protocol, Welles adjusted the lights on set as he was accustomed to doing in the theater; Toland quietly re-balanced them, and was angry when one of the crew informed Welles that he was infringing on Toland's responsibilities. During the first few weeks of June, Welles had lengthy discussions about the film with Toland and art director Perry Ferguson in the morning, and in the afternoon and evening he worked with actors and revised the script.|$|E
2500|$|He held a bachelor's {{degree in}} canon law by 13 December 1400. On 15 September 1402 Pope Benedict XIII {{provided}} Fionnlagh to a canonry (with {{the expectation of}} a prebend) in the diocese of Dunkeld; the mandate of provision contains information much about Fionnlagh, informing <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a priest, confirming that he possessed a bachelor's degree in canon law, while also stating that he was Archdeacon of Dunblane.|$|E
60|$|Now for {{the very}} same reason it is, that St John is so careful, first to tell <b>us</b> <b>that</b> The Word of God made all things; and then to tell <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> full of grace and truth.|$|R
5000|$|Saris criticized Adams for his {{praise of}} Japan and {{adoption}} of Japanese customs:He persists in giving [...] "admirable and affectionated commendations of Japan. It is generally thought amongst <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> a naturalized Japaner." [...] (John Saris) ...|$|R
60|$|It <b>is</b> {{enough for}} <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of the Holy Father, {{and of the}} Holy Son; like them eternal, like them incomprehensible, like them almighty, like them all-wise, all-just, all-loving, merciful, faithful, and true for ever.|$|R
2500|$|A {{variety of}} sources after Gildas name Arthur as the victor of the Battle of Mount Badon, at which the Saxons were routed and their invasions halted for many years. Historians regard it as a {{probable}} historical event. [...] Gildas's Latin is somewhat opaque: he does not name Arthur, or any other leader of the battle. He does discuss Ambrosius Aurelianus as a great scourge of the Saxons immediately prior, but seems to say some time passed between Ambrosius's victory and the battle of Badon. He also tells <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> born {{in the same year}} as the battle (which he describes as taking place [...] "in our times" [...] and being one of the latest - and greatest - slaughters of the Saxons) and that, {{at the time of his}} writing, a new generation born after the battle of Badon, has come of age in Britain.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{completion}} of the campaign in Poland the armoured forces were transferred to the west to prepare for the next set of operations. The four light divisions had proved to have inadequate firepower, and they were brought up to strength to full panzer divisions, one of which was given to Erwin Rommel. With this change the total number of panzer divisions in the Heer stood at ten. Guderian continued to work in development of the panzer arm. Said Hans von Luck of the 7th Panzer Division in his memoir: [...] "In the middle of February we were transferred to Dernau on the Ahr, hence practically in to the western front. Rommel visited every unit. He told <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> proud to be permitted to lead a panzer division. Guderian too came to inspect and talk to us. 'You are the cavalry' he told us. 'Your job is to break through and keep going.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 134 BC, he {{was serving}} {{with the army}} at Numantia and his good {{services}} {{brought him to the}} attention of Publius Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus Africanus. Whether he arrived with Scipio Aemilianus or was already serving in the demoralized army that Scipio Aemilianus took over at Numantia is not clear. According to Plutarch, during a conversation after dinner, when the conversation turned to generals, someone asked Scipio Aemilianus where the Roman people would find a worthy successor to him. Aemilianus then gently tapped on Marius' shoulder, saying: [...] "Perhaps this is the man." [...] It would seem that even at this early stage in his army career, Marius had ambitions for a political career in Rome. He ran for election as one of the twenty-four special military tribunes of the first four legions who were elected (the rest were appointed by the magistrate who raised the legion). Sallust tells <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> unknown by sight to the electors but was returned by all the tribes {{on the basis of his}} accomplishments.|$|E
6000|$|... 1. Either it is NOT bad, {{though it}} seems so to us; and God will bring good out of it in his good time, and justify himself to men, and show <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> holy in all his works, and righteous in all his ways.|$|R
5000|$|The voice tells <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> alone now, [...] "in {{the present}} as were I still."

I am no longer an enemy, but a follower of Jesus, and the preacher has told <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> the Prince of peace." ...|$|R
2500|$|Similarities between Spinoza's {{philosophy}} and Eastern philosophical traditions {{have been discussed}} by many authorities. The 19th-century German Sanskritist Theodore Goldstücker {{was one of the}} early figures to notice the similarities between Spinoza's religious conceptions and the Vedanta tradition of India, writing that Spinoza's thought was [...] "... a western system of philosophy which occupies a foremost rank amongst the philosophies of all nations and ages, and which is so exact a representation of the ideas of the Vedanta, that we might have suspected its founder to have borrowed the fundamental principles of his system from the Hindus, did his biography not satisfy <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> wholly unacquainted with their doctrines... We mean the philosophy of Spinoza, a man whose very life is a picture of that moral purity and intellectual indifference to the transitory charms of this world, which is the constant longing of the true Vedanta philosopher... comparing the fundamental ideas of both we should have no difficulty in proving that, had Spinoza been a Hindu, his system would in all probability mark a last phase of the Vedanta philosophy." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I know it not," [...] said Isaac; [...] "our last {{letters from}} our brethren at Paris advised <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> at that city, beseeching Philip for aid against the Sultan Saladine." ...|$|E
60|$|So it is; many a {{time the}} very blessing which we expect to get only with great difficulty, God gives us at our first trial, to show <b>that</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> the Giver, to cheer up our poor doubting hearts, and show <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> able, and willing too, to give {{exceeding}} abundantly {{more than we can}} ask or think.|$|R
60|$|The Friday of {{that very}} busy week {{in the life of}} this young man who even {{thereafter}} is to persist in reminding <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not in any sense a man of action, found the vestibule of the Manege empty of swordsmen when he made his leisurely and expectant egress between Le Chapelier and Kersain.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{nevertheless}} true," [...] Seaman insisted. [...] "No {{member of our}} service is allowed to remain more than one month without communicating his existence and whereabouts to headquarters. No word has been received from Wolff since that night in January. On the other hand, indirect information has reached <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> in durance over here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is nothing}} of the sort; when you are engaged to a person, you {{naturally}} call him by his Christian name. I can't think, though, why father didn't tell <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> coming." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think he}} was an ass at all. Of course he had to tell <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{changing}} his residence. He {{says that he is}} going to take a back bedroom somewhere near the Seven Dials." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{swallowed}} {{some wine}} {{and then sat}} up, leaning against me as I sat {{at the bottom of}} the stairs, quite himself again, and assuring <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not hurt; Perrault never touched him--"Threatened you, then," [...] said Fulk.|$|E
5000|$|Levine once {{referred}} {{to himself as}} “a dirty Detroit Jew with bad manners", and <b>he</b> has sometimes <b>been</b> criticized for leaning too hard on his blue-collar bona fides. The critic Adam Kirsch, writing in The Times Book Review in 1999, noted, accurately enough, that “in his autobiographical essays he goes {{out of his way}} to tell <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> essentially a peasant.” ...|$|R
60|$|From him comes all {{which raises}} us above the animals, and makes us {{really and truly}} men and women. All sense of duty, obedience, order, justice, law; all tenderness, pity, generosity, honour, modesty; all this, if you will receive it, is <b>that</b> Christ in <b>us</b> of whom St. Paul tells us, and tells <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> our hope of glory.|$|R
5000|$|At Balthasar's funeral, then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, {{later to}} become Pope Benedict XVI, said, {{speaking}} of Balthasar's work in general: [...] "What the pope intended to express by this mark of distinction elevation to the cardinalate, and of honor, remains valid; no longer only private individuals but the Church itself, in its official responsibility, tells <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> right {{in what he}} teaches of the faith." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But why {{on earth}} didn't he say he was innocent?" [...] Captain Bayley repeated, with {{something}} of his old irritation. [...] "What possessed him to run away {{as if he were}} guilty without making one protest to <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> innocent?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'That evening {{there came}} {{what seemed to}} me to be a grand release, for Hudson told <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to leave us. He walked into the dining-room as we sat after dinner, and {{announced}} his intention in the thick voice of a half-drunken man.|$|E
6000|$|St John {{tells us}} that He had one name which none knew save Himself. But he tells <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> called Faithful and True; and he tells us, too, that He had another name which St John did know; and that is, [...] "The Word of God." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It appears, in short, {{as if this}} miserable man, having {{exhausted}} [...] every {{species of}} sensual gratification--having drained the cup of [...] sin even to its bitterest dregs--were resolved to show <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> [...] no longer a human being even in his frailties, but a cool, unconcerned [...] fiend, laughing with detestable glee over {{the whole of the}} better and [...] worse elements of which human life is composed.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There you are, you see," [...] the {{councillor}} said triumphantly to his colleagues. [...] "Look at the obstinacy and insolence {{of these}} Hollanders. Even this brat {{of a boy}} dares to tell <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not a Catholic. Take him away," [...] {{he said to the}} warder, [...] "and see <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> securely kept. We may want to question him again; but in any case he will go to the gallows tomorrow or next day." ...|$|R
6000|$|It is {{the whole}} {{difference}} between {{the aim of the}} orator and the aim of any other artist, such as the poet or the sculptor. The aim of the sculptor <b>is</b> to convince <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> a sculptor; the aim of the orator, <b>is</b> to convince <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not an orator. Once let Mr. Chamberlain be mistaken for a practical man, and his game <b>is</b> won. <b>He</b> has only to compose a theme on empire, and people will say that these plain men say great things on great occasions. He has only to drift in the large loose notions common to all artists of the second rank, and people will say that business men have the biggest ideals after all. All his schemes have ended in smoke; he has touched nothing <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did not confuse. About his figure there is a Celtic pathos; like the Gaels in Matthew Arnold's quotation, [...] "he went forth to battle, but he always fell." [...] <b>He</b> <b>is</b> a mountain of proposals, a mountain of failures; but still a mountain. And a mountain is always romantic.|$|R
60|$|Drawing near, the {{stranger}} informed <b>us,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{just from the}} face of the great Pontiff, Hivohitee, who, having dismissed his celestial guests, had retired to his private sanctuary. Upon this, Media resolved to land forthwith, and under the guidance of Mohi, proceed inland, and pay a visit to his Holiness.|$|E
60|$|He tells <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{reclaimed}} at {{last from}} a profligate life (the thought of honourable marriage seems {{never to have}} entered his mind), by meeting, while practising as a rhetorician at Treves, an old African acquaintance, named Potitanius, an officer of rank. What followed no words can express so {{well as those of}} the great genius himself.|$|E
6000|$|In {{reference}} to this, Monsieur Nadar tells <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> deeply {{impressed with the}} belief that the screw would ultimately become our aerial motor, but that, being ignorant of what it was likely the experiments of this first aeromotive would cost, he had resolved, instead of begging for funds to enable him to accomplish his great end, to procure funds for himself in the following manner:-- ...|$|E
