Comparisons of performance measures {{are used for}} different urposes.

Regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>urpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> comparisons <b>of</b> performance measures, {{it is important that}} the compared measures re defined and applied homogeneously and consistently, i. e. they must have information orrespondence in order to be comparable; otherwise, erroneous decisions can be made. owever, commensurability is not enough. If the compared measures are to have any information alue, the measures also need to be chosen carefully, so that, in a relevant and reliable way, they eflect the measured objects’ most important qualities. This paper analyses performance easures used in three benchmarking projects in the Swedish water and sewage sector.
