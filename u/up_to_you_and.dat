5|$|Seeing all the singers, {{you really}} {{come face to}} face with a lot of people that are {{predominantly}} younger. That's inspiring, because they come <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> they're such big fans and they share with you what song touched them the most and how they had to learn every single ad lib and dissect it. As a vocalist it brought me back to, 'Yeah, that's what I used to do to my Whitney Houston record and my Mariah Carey record and my Etta James record.' It brings you back to a place where it becomes your personal responsibility to infuse the next generation with more information about learning every intricate note. That's why a song called 'Sing for Me' is a special song. It's one of those singer's songs where if you're not a vocalist you can't mess with that song.|$|E

According to Bill Mechanic, the former head of 20th Century Fox, [...] "John wanted me to make Battlefield Earth. He had Scientologists all over me. They come <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> they know who you are. And they go, 'We're really excited about Battlefield Earth.'" [...] This did not impress Mechanic: [...] "Do you think in any way, shape, or form that weirding me out is going to make me want to make this movie?" ...|$|E
500|$|The tank {{scene was}} created {{completely}} using CGI. The only actual footage {{from the scene}} was the background. A computer-generated tank, along with women, were designed on a computer. Then, special effects shots of smoke and explosions were layered {{on top of the}} vehicle to give it a more life-like appearance. Bruce Harwood, who portrayed Byers, noted that the action sequences in the episode were a challenge. He explained, [...] "It's pretty difficult on a set when the stuntmen come <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> go, 'Don't worry, you'll be safe, Nothing to worry about. Okay. Everyone put their safety glasses on.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Meyer {{has been}} {{publicly}} credited with [...] "thoroughly shap...the comedic sensibility" [...] of The Simpsons; in 2000, Mike Scully, the show runner {{for the series}} at the time, called him [...] "the best comedy writer in Hollywood." [...] Scully said he was [...] "the main reason" [...] why The Simpsons [...] still so good after all these years." [...] Vitti has said Meyer's [...] "fingerprints are on nearly every script" [...] and he [...] "exerts as much influence on the show as anyone can without {{being one of the}} creators," [...] while recounting how [...] "a show that you have the writer's credit for will run, and the next day people will come <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> tell you how great it was. Then they'll mention their two favorite lines, and both of them will be George's." [...] Bill Oakley noted Meyer has [...] "he's been there since the beginning adding thousands of jokes and plot twists, etc., that everyone considers classic and brilliant.|$|E
500|$|Lee {{became known}} for his [...] "frightening" [...] {{tendency}} to not [...] "mince words". The director often had his cast do numerous takes for a scene {{in order to get}} the perfect shot, and was not afraid to call something [...] "boring" [...] if he disliked it. Thompson later recalled the director would [...] "always come <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> say something unexpectedly crushing", such as asking her not to [...] "look so old." [...] She also commented, however, that [...] "he doesn't indulge us but is always kind when we fail." [...] Due to Thompson's extensive acting experience, the director encouraged her to practice t'ai chi to [...] "help her relax [...] make her do things simpler." [...] Other actors soon joined them in meditating – according to Doran, it [...] "was pretty interesting. There were all these pillows on the floor and these pale-looking actors were saying, 'What have we got ourselves into?' [...] was more focused on body language than any director I've ever seen or heard of." [...] He suggested Winslet read books of poetry and report back to him in order to best understand her character. He also had Thompson and Winslet live together to develop their characters' sisterly bond. Many of the cast took lessons in etiquette and riding side-saddle.|$|E
500|$|For {{most of the}} film, Berry's character, Turner, the 9-1-1 operator, does {{stay inside}} [...] "the hive" [...] before {{becoming}} {{actively involved in the}} search for Breslin's character, Welson, the kidnapped caller. D'Ovidio chose two female leads, explaining, [...] "I wanted strong women... I think it was appropriate here, since most 911 call operators are women." [...] Berry remarked, [...] "I love the idea of being a part of a movie that was so empowering for women. We don't often get to play roles like this, where ordinary people become heroic and do something extraordinary." [...] D'Ovidio chose to tell the story from the perspective of two characters—the operator and the caller—believing that it would become repetitive if it focused on only one. As a result, he switched perspectives every ten pages when writing the screenplay. As well as collaborating on the story with his wife, Nicole and Jon Bokenkamp, he accepted suggestions from Berry, Breslin and Eklund: [...] "Halle came in with some great notes and Abigail and Michael and it started to flesh things out. I'm not one to say 'no' to a great suggested line of dialogue. It just makes me look better as a writer! I feel it's a very collaborative process, and some of the happiest accidents happen when you just listen to people. When someone comes <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> says, 'Why don't we do it this way?' I think that it's important to listen." ...|$|E

500|$|Ryan Reed of Paste Magazine {{called it}} [...] "a driving pop anthem that moves from a punchy, 'Roxanne'-esque new-wave groove to a soulful, synth-driven chorus." [...] Matt Cibula of PopMatters further {{explained}} the track, writing, [...] "It starts out like an early Police single, with some straight-up Reggatta de Blanc syncopation and a shockingly good Sting vocal impression. But the chorus opens up {{to turn into}} something less Police-y and more, dare I say it, Bruno Mars-y." [...] Kitty Empire of The Observer wrote that the song [...] "channels the Police, but its 21st-century builds owe as much to rave-pop as they do to producer Mark Ronson. It's an ill-omened meeting that somehow gels." [...] Jason Lipshut of Billboard gave a very positive review, stating that [...] "'Locked out of Heaven' is Mars' best solo single to date, with the singer-songwriter yelping about fornication as a tossed salad of chopped guitars and vocal exclamations buttress his sumptuous leading-man act. Sometimes, the perfect lead single is hard to find; other times, it walks right <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> delivers a big, cozy hug." [...] Melinda Newman of HitFix praised [...] "Mars' singing and the catchy little background vocals," [...] which according to her, [...] "keep the song moving downstream at a rapid pace." [...] She also noted that [...] "Even clumsy lyrics like 'your sex takes me to paradise' can’t diminish that joy that the beats and melody bring." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{obtaining the}} summit of the ridge the allied column found itself facing the French {{infantry}} line. The French guards rose and advanced towards the crest, whereupon the two forces confronted each other at a distance of 30 paces. The moment was immortalised by Lord Charles Hay of the 1st Regiment of Guards who later wrote that he stepped forward, took out a hip flask and drank with a flourish, shouting out to his opponent, [...] "We are the English Guards, and we hope you will stand till we come <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> not swim the Scheldt as you did the Main at Dettingen." [...] He then led his men in three cheers. Voltaire's version of this famous episode has become proverbial. He wrote: [...] "The English officers saluted the French by doffing their hats … [...] the French, returned the greeting. My Lord Charles Hai, captain in the English Guards, cried, 'Gentlemen of the French Guards, fire.' The Comte d'Auteroche, then lieutenant of Grenadiers, shouted, 'Gentlemen, we never fire first; fire yourselves.'" [...] The French were the first to fire, the volley was somewhat ineffective but threw the Third Guards into some confusion and wounded George Churchill, the commander of the guards brigade. Captain Lord Panmure led the unbroken companies of the Third Guards to the flank of the First Guards. Up to this point the British column had not fired a single musket shot, but now the allied infantry poured a devastating discharge into the French. The volley of musketry with the battalion guns delivering numerous rounds of grape-shot, swept away the front rank of the ten battalions of the French first line, killing and wounding between 700–800 men, breaking the Gardes Françaises, while the Gardes Suisses and the four battalions of the Brigade Aubeterre were driven back by the British advance.|$|E
