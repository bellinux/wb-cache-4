60|$|The {{currents}} {{here were}} of a complicated kind. It was true, as the girl had said, that the tide ran round to the north, but at a special moment in every flood there set in along the shore a narrow reflux contrary to the general outer flow, called 'The Southern' by the local sailors. It was produced by the peculiar curves of coast lying east and west of the Beal; these bent southward in two back streams the <b>up-Channel</b> flow {{on each side of}} the peninsula, which two streams united outside the Beal, and there met the direct tidal flow, the confluence of the three currents making the surface of the sea at this point to boil like a pot, even in calmest weather.

When daylight returned, however, with a clear horizon, no increase of wind, and nothing in sight, I was so much relieved as to take a good nap until eight. All that day we started neither tack nor sheet, nor touched a brace. Towards evening I went aloft myself to look for land, but without success, though I knew, from our observation at noon, it could not be far off. Fifty years ago the longitude was the great difficulty with navigators. Both Talcott and myself did very well with the lunars, it is true; but there was no chance to observe, and even lunars soon get out of their reckoning among currents and tides. Glad enough, then, was I to hear Neb sing but [...] "Light ahead!" [...] from the fore-top-sail-yard. This was about ten o'clock. I knew this light must be the Lizard, as we were too far to the eastward for Scilly. The course was changed so as to bring the light a little on the weather-bow; and I watched for its appearance to us on deck with an anxiety I have experienced, since, only in the most trying circumstances. Half an hour sufficed for this, and then I felt comparatively happy. A new beginner even is not badly off with the wind fresh at south-west, and the Lizard light in plain view on his weather-bow, if he happen to be bound <b>up-channel.</b> That night, consequently, proved to be more comfortable than the previous.|$|E

40|$|The {{distribution}} of ultra-high-pressure (UHP) metamorphic rocks demonstrates that burial (to > 100 km) and rapid exhumation (> 1 cm a− 1) of continental crust {{is a normal}} part of early (10 Ma) continental collision. Currently, there is no comprehensive model for this fundamental tectonic process that also satisfactorily explains the upper-crustal structures resulting from early collisional UHP rock exhumation. Characteristic features requiring explanation include: structural domes that are cored by UHP nappes; associated medium- to high-pressure nappes displaying a distinct “pressure gap”; overlying lower-grade rocks, including suture zone ophiolites; and, coeval foreland-directed thrust-faults and syn-exhumation normal faults. We present a geodynamical model involving crustal burial and exhumation in a subduction channel below an accretionary wedge. Competition between down-channel shear traction and <b>up-channel</b> buoyancy forces, expressed as the exhumation number, E, controls burial and exhumation, leading to rapid <b>up-channel</b> flow when E > 1. Exhuming UHP material forms a nappe stack and structural dome as it penetrates and destabilises the overlying wedge, driving thrusting and extension. This solution is compelling because it explains both the geology and the petrology of the Tso Morari and other UHP complexes, and because it demonstrates that pulse-like buoyant exhumation from deep in the subduction channel creates observed upper crustal structures. This places constraints on the exhumation mechanism and provides a test of alternative models. Other proposed mechanisms, such as continuous circulation in a lithospheric-scale wedge or overpressured subduction channel, predict different types of upper-crustal structures and are therefore unsatisfactory explanations for early collisional exhumation of UHP terranes...|$|E
40|$|UHP rocks {{commonly}} {{form and}} exhume {{during the transition}} from oceanic subduction to continental collision. Their exhumation in subduction channels depends on the balance between down-channel shear traction and <b>up-channel</b> buoyancy. Thermal-mechanical upper-mantle-scale numerical models are used to investigate how variations in material properties of the subducting continental margin affect this balance. Changes in shear traction leading to crustal decoupling/detachment are investigated by varying the onset of strain weakening, thermal parameters, and convergence velocity. Variations in buoyancy force are investigated by modifying subducted material density and volume. The model results are interpreted {{in terms of the}} exhumation number E, which expresses the role of the pressure gradient, channel thickness, effective viscosity, and subduction velocity. Peak metamorphic conditions, exhumation velocity, and timing of exhumation are temporally and spatially variable and are sensitive to the evolution of E.

40|$|The {{exhumation}} of crustal ultra-high-pressure (UHP) material {{depends on}} {{temporal and spatial}} variations in its detachment within the subduction channel. This dependence is investigated using numerical models with variable initial crustal strengths, representing a range of initial crustal compositions, and parameterized strain weakening, representing a range of processes that reduce effective crustal viscosity during deformation. Competition between down-channel shear traction, favoring subduction, and <b>up-channel</b> buoyancy, favoring exhumation, is expressed as the exhumation number, E, which can vary with time and position along the channel. Exhumed lower strength crust, which resists subduction owing to weak down-channel traction, records peak conditions − 1. Higher strength crust is efficiently subducted to UHP depths (E 38 kbar. Given sufficient strain weakening, exhumation proceeds at > 60 km Ma − 1, indicating that buoyancy (E » 1) drives exhumation in these models.

40|$|Abstract: Surveys of subtidal and {{intertidal}} sediment distributions were undertaken i {{the upper}} Humber and Ouse during autumn (fall) and winter. Within the Ouse, {{the great majority}} of sediment samples comprised a mixture of predominantly silt and clay ( 63 and < 125 ~m). A pronounced seasonal transport was observed both in subtidal lag sediments and intertidal bank sediments. The strongest difference between autumn and winter distributions of subtidal bed sediments resulted from the down-estuary movement of very fine sand from {{the upper reaches of the}} Ouse during winter. This feature was also evident i he intertidal sediments. Intertidal banks in the upper eaches of the Ouse utilized very fine sand to grow during summer and autumn, and were eroded back to stronger silt and clay substrates over the winter period. The down-channel redistribution of sand-sized sediment was a response to increased freshwater inflows overwinter. This movement is approximately balanced in summer and autumn, during low freshwater inflows, by an <b>up-channel</b> sediment ransport due to tidal velocity asymmetry and its associated flood dominance. The aims of this study were to investigate th...|$|E
40|$|Scientists {{studying}} badland {{processes in}} Mediterranean and Semi-arid climates require assurances {{that the material}} in which gullies are presented is not dispersive. A dispersive context means; first, infiltration rates may be radically changing in very short periods due to swelling and deflocculation of clays; second, surface crusts could {{be the result of}} translocation of sodium into subsurface positions; third, rills may be formed or at least exacerbated by shallow subsurface erosion; fourth, large gullies with substantial <b>up-channel</b> headcuts, including so-called ‘bank gullies’, may have formed because subsurface pipes have collapsed; and fifth, that network connectivity and evolution may be principally internal, being effected by subsurface pipe capture network integration; and most importantly, the bulk of the sediment moving around in the landscape is not being lost from the surface. This paper presents a decision-support tool to assist the effective diagnosis of a landscape's principal genetic process suite.

40|$|Aasxa^cr: Calculations of {{cohesionless}} bottom-sediment movement {{within the}} New York Bight {{have been made}} by applying the transport formulae of Bagnold (1941, 195 C 1963), Einstein (1950), and Yalin (1963) to near-bottom current meter and sufficial sand size observations. Current data were drawn from the records of eighteen long-term Savonius rotor current meter deployments at various locations within the Bight during Fall of 1973 and Spring of 1974. The assumptions underlying the calculations are that wave activity was minimal at recording sites, that a drag coefficient of 3 × 10 - ~ reflecting small scale roughness and large boundary layer Reynolds number is suitable to convert measured currents to friction velocities, and that laboratory threshold velocities apply in the marine environment. The calculations suggest that oceanic bottom sediment movement reaches maximum intensity during the fall and winter due to the added energy input from strong meterological events. Calculated transport quantities on the inner shelf tend to decrease as depth and distance from shore increase. However, during the Fall of 1973, the deep waters near the head of the Hudson Shelf Valley exhibited current flows directed to the north in excess of 40 cm/sec. These <b>up-channel</b> flow events appear to be in response to strong, sustained westerly winds. The maximum sediment transport rate caused by these current velocities is two orders of magnitude greater than that occurring at much shallower depths along the New Jersey coast during the same measurement period. The Spring 1974 current velocity field yields transport rates of lesser magnitudes relative to the previous fall, with a net down-channel sediment flux {{at the head of the}} Hudson Shelf Valley. The New York Harbor entrance appears to be the site of near-continual sediment transport generated by swift tidal currents...|$|E

40|$|An {{open channel}} lava flow on Mt. Etna (Sicily) was {{observed}} during May 30 – 31, 2001. Data collected using a forward looking infrared (FLIR) thermal {{camera and a}} Minolta-Land Cyclops 300 thermal infrared thermometer showed that the bulk volume flux of lava flowing in the channel varied greatly over time. Cyclic changes in the channel’s volumetric flow rate occurred over several hours, with cycle durations of 113 – 190 min, and discharges peaking at 0. 7 m 3 s− 1 and waning to 0. 1 m 3 s− 1. Each cycle was characterized by a relatively short, high-volume flux phase during which a pulse of lava,with awell-defined flow front, would propagate down-channel, followed by a period of waning flow during which volume flux lowered. Pulses involved lava moving at relatively high velocities (up to 0. 29 m s− 1) and were related to some change in the flow conditions occurring <b>up-channel,</b> possibly at the vent. They implied either {{a change in the}} dense rock effusion rate at the source vent and/or cyclic-variation in the vesicle content of the lava changing its bulk volume flux. Pulses would generally overspill the channel to emplace p¯ahoehoe overflows. During periods of waning flow, velocities fell to 0. 05 m s– 1. Blockages forming during such phases caused lava to back up. Occasionally backup resulted in overflows of slow moving ‘a‘¯a that would advance a few tens of meters down the levee flank. Compound levees were thus a symptom of unsteady flow, where overflow levees were emplaced as relatively fast moving p¯ahoehoe sheets during pulses, and as slow-moving ‘a‘¯a units during backup. Small, localized fluctuations in channel volume flux also occurred on timescales of minutes. Volumes of lava backed up behind blockages that formed at constrictions in the channel. Blockage collapse and/or enhanced flow under/around the blockage would then feed short-lived, wave-like, downchannel surges. Real fluctuations in channel volume flux, due to pulses and surges, can lead to significant errors in effusion rate calculations...|$|E

40|$|Investigations {{into the}} {{physical}} oceanographic {{characteristics of the}} Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary are reviewed; these include the general pattern of water movement {{and the influence of}} high freshwater discharges on the salinity distribution. Various approaches to the problem of defining sediment transport paths in the macrotidal estuarine system, for fine grained and coarse grained material, are summarised. Transport patterns are examined, for example, through: the distribution of surficial sediments and their associated bedforms; seabed drifter studies; the analysis of tidal current and wave data, separately and in combination, because of their influence on bedload transport paths; satellite imagery, within the visible part of the spectrum; and on the basis of output from depth-averaged numerical models. Comparison between the interpretations shows that there are discrepancies and contradictions in the derived sediment transport paths. In particular, it is difficult to explain the <b>up-channel</b> movement of fine grained material against a background of inferred offshore movement, shown by the orientation of sandwaves and the direction of movement of the surface waters. An early model to overcome this contradiction incorporated ‘two-way differential transport’ throughout the water column. Localised contradictions in the transport paths for sand and ‘fine sediment’ occur in the inner part of the Bristol Channel. The most recent conjectural models for sediment movement incorporate an ebb- dominated zone along the central axis of the Channel, together with flood-dominated coastal zones. This lateral variation in transport paths, across the Channel, constrasts with the earlier proposition for vertical differentiation; it is suggested by seabed drifter recovery patterns and confirmed by the output from one of the numerical models. Transport towards the flood-dominated zones at the boundaries is enhanced under the superimposed influence of waves, which is demonstrated through the use of sediment transport formulae and sand tracer experiments. Although the annual contribution of the rivers to the overall sediment budget is shown to be small, the time of retention of waters and sediment within the system could result in fluviatile sediment inputs being retained for tens of years. In an attempt to extrapolate observations of transport processes into the ancient record, a preliminary facies model for the macrotidal Bristol Channel is presented. The model shows the availability of sand increasing in an onshore direction; progressing in this direction, the facies pass from scoured bedrock and lag deposits, through cross bedded megaripple foresets and the topset planar bedding of intertidal flats, to Holocene fill and supratidal deposits...|$|E
40|$|The Whittard Canyon (NE Atlantic) {{is one of}} {{the largest}} canyon systems on the {{northern}} Bay of Biscay margin. It likely receives a high input of organic matter from the productive overlying surface waters, and part of this organic matter may eventually be transferred down the canyon into the Whittard Channel extending from the canyon mouth onto the Biscay Abyssal Plain. To establish if substantial transport of organic matter takes place from the canyon into the deep-sea channel we: (1) deployed a benthic lander in the Whittard Channel for a period of one year to measure near-bottom particulate matter transport and deposition rates; (2) collected surface sediment samples from the Whittard Channel and adjacent areas to assess possible organic matter enrichment in the channel (3) surveyed transects across the channel and adjacent areas with towed video camera to assess distribution of benthic megafauna potentially indicating enhanced flux of fresh organic material. The video surveys revealed massive occurrence of elpidiid holothurians in the proximal Whittard Channel, whilst only low numbers were counted further down the channel and on areas adjacent to the channel. We speculate that these deposit-feeding holothurians were attracted by the elevated content of relatively fresh organic matter in surface sediments of the proximal channel, as indicated by analysis of the surface sediment samples. Yet, whilst we expected that organic matter enrichment in the channel could be attributed to down-canyon transport through the Whittard Canyon, this could not be confirmed by data recorded by the benthic lander. During most of the 1 -year deployment period, the net near-bottom currents and suspended particulate matter transport was directed in <b>up-channel</b> direction. During two sediment-gravity flow events recorded in March and July 2011, most likely originating from the Whittard Canyon, substantial deposition of particulate matter did occur in the Whittard Channel. However, the material deposited during those events consisted largely of inorganic sediment and was relatively poor in fresh organic material, and hence could not have substantially contributed to the organic matter enrichment observed in the channel. The highest deposition flux of fresh organic matter, recorded in May 2011, was not associated with any down-channel flow and more likely was derived from local settling of phytodetritus produced during the spring phytoplankton bloom. Based on our observations we infer that the organic enrichment observed in the proximal Whittard Channel is due to redistribution of phytodetritus by bottom currents, and accumulation of this material in the topographic depression formed by the Whittard Channel. The mobility of the elpidiid holothurians allows them to exploit these localised food sources...|$|E
