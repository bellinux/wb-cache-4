5|$|According to Clan MacLeod tradition, Leod {{inherited}} {{some of his}} lands from {{a foster}} father, who was a sheriff of the Hebridean island of Skye; other lands he inherited from his father-in-law, {{who was also a}} lord on Skye. MacLeod tradition also states that Leod was the father of four sons and two daughters. Two of these sons founded the two main branches of MacLeods; branches which exist to this day—Tormod (from whom the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan descend) and Torquil (from whom the MacLeods of Lewis descend). The traditional belief that Torquil was a son has also been challenged; the current <b>understanding</b> <b>is</b> that he was a great-grandson of Leod. In recent years, the DNA evidence of men bearing surnames equating to MacLeod has revealed that a certain proportion share a common ancestor—an ancestor considered to have been the clan's founder.|$|E
5|$|English doctor Maxwell (Shearsmith) {{settles into}} bunk 9E while {{travelling}} from Paris to Bourg-Saint-Maurice. Maxwell is disturbed first by Jorg (Pemberton), a drunk, flatulent German who climbs into bunk 9D, then by Kath (Hesmondhalgh) and Les (Benton), a couple travelling to their daughter's wedding. Jorg is in Les's bed, but the couple climb into 9A. Australian backpacker Shona (Gunning) enters; she places her bag on bunk 9C then leaves, and Maxwell closes the door. Kath and Les, laughing at Maxwell, begin to undress on the bed. Les wakes Jorg, but <b>understanding</b> <b>is</b> limited until Maxwell translates. Jorg switches to 9F and Les climbs into 9D.|$|E

40|$|The study {{examined}} perceived similarity and understanding in dyadic coping among 197 young and 192 mature couples. Perceived similarity and <b>understanding</b> <b>were</b> computed through a dyad-centered approach. To separate 2 equally important components of dyadic congruence (i. e., unique and stereotypical similarity) stereotype adjusted and unadjusted scores were computed. Results indicated that stereotype effects were higher among young couples than among mature couples; perceived stereotypical similarity was higher in young couples than in mature couples and stereotypical and partner-specific <b>understanding</b> <b>were</b> higher in mature couple relationships. Stereotypical <b>understanding</b> <b>was</b> {{positively associated with}} relationship quality but only among mature couples. Partner-specific <b>understanding</b> <b>was</b> not associated with relationship quality in mature couples, but it was negatively associated with relationship quality in young couples. © 2011 IARR...|$|R

40|$|The term {{conceptual}} <b>understanding</b> <b>was</b> {{analyzed to}} determine how educators can help students attain understanding in a concept based curriculum. The investigator sought to establish what salient dimensions and conditions supported conceptual understanding. A dimensional analysis of the term conceptual <b>understanding</b> <b>was</b> employed through {{a review of the}} literature in mathematics, science, psychology, and nursing education. The salient dimensions of conceptual <b>understanding</b> <b>were</b> identified as: factual and procedural knowledge, connections, transfer, and metacognition. The supporting properties included: meaningful learning activities, memorization, and misconceptions. The results substantiate conceptual understanding as a process. When this process is utilized by nurse educators, students may better connect and organize knowledge aiding in the knowledge transfer that occurs between theory and practice...|$|R

It can take different forms in different cultures and this needs to be taken into consideration when assessing critical results.|$|E
25|$|Chakraborti et al. {{find that}} the three GPs {{observed}} by the GMRT have a magnetic field of B~39 μG, and more generally a figure of greater than B~30μG for all the GPs.

The observations of GPs challenge that thinking.|$|E
25|$|While we {{know about}} the types of {{cytokine}} patterns helper T cells tend to produce, we understand less about how the patterns themselves are decided. Various evidence suggests that the type of APC presenting the antigen to the T cell has a major influence on its profile. Other evidence suggests that the concentration of antigen presented to the T cell during primary activation influences its choice. The presence of some cytokines (such as the ones mentioned above) will also influence the response that will eventually be generated, but our <b>understanding</b> <b>is</b> nowhere near complete.|$|E

25|$|The Carved Stone Balls {{have been}} taken as {{evidence}} of knowledge of the five Platonic solids a millennium before Plato described them. Indeed, some of them exhibit the symmetries of Platonic solids, but the extent of this {{and how much it}} depends on mathematical <b>understanding</b> <b>is</b> disputed, as configurations resembling the solids can naturally arise when placing knobs around a sphere. There {{does not appear to be}} much special attention given to the Platonic solid arrangements over less symmetrical arrangements of knobs over the balls, and some of the five solids do not appear.|$|E
25|$|Judgments are, for Kant, the {{preconditions}} of any thought.

For the categories are equivalent to these moments, in that they are concepts of intuitions in general, so far as they are determined by these moments universally and necessarily. Thus by listing all the moments, one can deduce from them all of the categories.|$|E

25|$|Aphasia affects {{both the}} {{expression}} and reception of language. Both two most common types, expressive aphasia and receptive aphasia, affect speech perception to some extent. Expressive aphasia causes moderate difficulties for language understanding. The effect of receptive aphasia on <b>understanding</b> <b>is</b> much more severe. It is agreed upon, that aphasics suffer from perceptual deficits. They usually cannot fully distinguish place of articulation and voicing. As for other features, the difficulties vary. It {{has not yet}} been proven whether low-level speech-perception skills are affected in aphasia sufferers or whether their difficulties are caused by higher-level impairment alone.|$|E
25|$|The {{regulation}} of dietary iron absorption {{is complex and}} our <b>understanding</b> <b>is</b> incomplete. One of the better characterized genes responsible for hereditary haemochromatosis is HFE on chromosome 6, which codes for a protein that participates in the {{regulation of}} iron absorption. The HFE gene has two common mutations, C282Y and H63D. The C282Y allele is a transition point mutation from guanine to adenine at nucleotide 845 in the HFE gene, resulting in a missense mutation that replaces the cysteine residue at position 282 with a tyrosine amino acid. Heterozygotes for either allele do not manifest clinical iron overload but may display an increased iron uptake.|$|E
