Modern business management has not been applied in terms of aspects of production, utilization of human resources, and marketing and financial management. This study aimed to determine the capacity of human resources (management or business owners) in managing HFI in Bone Regency, as well as development efforts that can be done to improve their capacity. The results showed that the main products produced by HFI in Bone Regency were ranging from traditional foods (traditional cakes) to modern food (nuggets, meatballs, milkfish presto etc.). The capacity of human resources in managing HFI is limited in several important aspects, Financial management was not designed well; for example, production costs were not calculated in a careful, complete, thorough, and precise manner; so that the benefit was not known or could not be predicted with certainty. Marketing management was weak in providing a good product identity name, brand, and expiration date. In terms of production management production plan was not designed well, so sometimes the excessive stocks spoiled before being sold, and sometimes they ran out of supplies, meaning they could not meet consumers' demands. The over and <b>under-productions</b> affected the overall benefit generated from the business operation. Human resources were managed a simple manner because the businesses employed small numbers of workers...|$|R

Synaptic plasticity is a key contributor to learning and memory, two processes that are severely impaired in AD patients. Translational control, or the maintenance of protein homeostasis, {{has been shown to}} be essential for neural plasticity and is regulated by mTOR. [...] Both protein over- and <b>under-production</b> via mTOR activity seem to contribute to impaired learning and memory. Furthermore, given that deficits resulting from mTOR overactivity can be alleviated through treatment with rapamycin, it is possible that mTOR plays an important role in affecting cognitive functioning through synaptic plasticity. [...] Further evidence for mTOR activity in neurodegeneration comes from recent findings demonstrating that eIF2α-P, an upstream target of the mTOR pathway, mediates cell death in prion diseases through sustained translational inhibition. [...] Some evidence points to mTOR’s role in reduced Aβ clearance as well. mTOR is a negative regulator of autophagy; therefore, hyperactivity in mTOR signaling should reduce Aβ clearance in the AD brain. Disruptions in autophagy may be a potential source of pathogenesis in protein misfolding diseases, including AD. [...] Studies using mouse models of Huntington’s disease demonstrate that treatment with rapamycin facilitates the clearance of huntingtin aggregates.

Obesity is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and leads to several diseases, including metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular, fatty liver diseases, and cancer. Growing evidence allows us to understand the critical role of adipose tissue in controlling the physic-pathological mechanisms of obesity and related comorbidities. Recently, adipose tissue, especially in the visceral compartment, has been considered not only as a simple energy depository tissue, but also as an active endocrine organ releasing a variety of biologically active molecules known as adipocytokines or adipokines.

This paper develops a two-period model to analyse the joint effects of both problems on a small and remote tourism economy. Congestion and the complementariness between foreign transport and local tourism services are key features {{in this type of}} markets. As a result, direct selling and the presence of foreign tour-operators emerge as possible market arrangements with different implications in terms of welfare and public intervention. Four main results are obtained. First, in the direct selling situation the optimal policy depends on the relative importance of the problems. Second, the existence of tour-operators always leads to tourism over-production. Third, the presence of a single tour-operator does not solve the congestion problem. Lastly, the switch from several tour-operators to a single one is welfare reducing. commons, anti-commons, tourism, direct selling, tour-operators, optimal policy...|$|E

We also discuss variation of CODP positioning, total cost and payment when rate of return changes. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{scope of}} this thesis is Australia from {{the late nineteenth century}} to 1939, viewed through the lens of three interrelated {{industries}} – wheat-growing, flour-milling and bread-baking. Authoritative literature on wheat-growing is abundant, but literature on bread-baking and flour-milling is scant, so this thesis aims to add to the literature by explicating the interconnectedness of these three kindred industries. In the period covered, Australia achieved its sought-after wheat surplus, but as the title suggests, these industries lurched through cycles of triumph and crisis as breakthroughs were achieved only to suffer unforeseen setbacks, culminating in some of the industry coming to near collapse. This thesis argues that Australia's shift from chronic <b>under-production</b> of wheat as an insular socio-economic outpost of Britain, to a sovereign nation-state operating in a global grain and flour market profoundly altered the production, supply, price and quality of flour-based staples to Australian and international customers and consumers.

I find that a truth-telling equilibrium could exist where the bureau's ability to influence would deter it from lying and the level of bureaucratic provision would be efficient. However, there could also be an equilibrium where the bureau would lie in which case there would be either over-production or <b>under-production.</b> This suggests that even when the bureau only cares about extracting the surplus value of its production, there could still be over-production simply due to the bureau's ability to distort cost informationBureaucracy, Influence, Truth-Telling...|$|E

A previous suppressor analysis had identified two genes, SMc 00067 and SMc 03872, involved in the synthesis of exopolysaccharide-I (EPS-I), critical for symbiosis. A loss-of-function mutation in either gene resulted in lower production of EPS-I. We used epistasis analysis to investigate the relationship between SMc 00067 and SMc 03872 and other EPS-I synthesis genes (exoY, exoS, exoR and, expR+). I confirmed lower EPS-I levels in the ASMc 00067 and ASMc 03872 mutants by direct measurement via anthrone assays. I also found reduced expression of exoY, encoding an enzyme required for EPS-I synthesis, in the mutants. We expected the EPS-I <b>under-production</b> to affect the ability of these two mutant strains to infect and form nodules on alfalfa roots.

In sharp contrast, genetic and biochemical studies have demonstrated bacterial NO to protect gram-positive pathogens like Staphyloccocus aureus and Bacillis anthracis against oxidative and antibiotic stress. In order to first evaluate the protective functions afforded by bacterial NOS (bNOS), we identified several inhibitors that bind tightly to bNOS and demonstrated antimicrobial properties. These initial studies allowed for extensive crystallographic analyses in order to characterize inhibitor “hot-spots” and pharmacophores with improved bNOS inhibitor selectivity. Validation and characterization of these inhibitors also required development of new tools to assess bNOS inhibition. These tools include the utilization of bacterial redox partners we identified that support bNOS activity. More importantly, these tools allowed for the development of new assays to rapidly identify potent NOS inhibitors. Together, these studies represent the first exploitation of bNOS as a therapeutic target and make significant contributions towards the continued development and characterization of bNOS inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a simple {{model of a}} decentralized multi-product firm in which transfer pricing is used to co-ordinate the activities of its constituent divisions. Two goods are produced in a single facility and the accounting system provides the full cost for each based on a rule in which overhead costs are allocated in proportion to direct labor costs. The study compares the performance of some commonly used transfer pricing (TP) policies with respect to level as well as efficiency of production. The policies studied are Actual Cost-Based TP (ACTP), Standard Cost-Based TP (SCTP), and a hybrid TP policy based on both standard and actual costs. It is shown that under ACTP managers may have incentives to “pad ” as well as misallocate costs deliberately to maximize their divisional incomes, while under SCTP there is over-reporting of costs leading to <b>under-production.</b> In general, neither policy achieves the first-best level of production or profit. ACTP yields higher profits to the firm than SCTP if the internally transferred good is the primary good produced by the firm. The hybrid policy eliminates some of the production inefficiencies associated with ACTP {{as well as the}} over-reporting problems associated with SCTP, resulting in a higher profit to the firm than can be achieved using either policy alone...|$|E
40|$|The Na-O anticorrelation seen {{in almost}} all {{globular}} clusters ever studied using high-resolution spectroscopy is now generally explained by the primordial pollution from {{the first generation of}} the intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch stars to the proto-stellar clouds of the second generation of stars. However, the primordial pollution scenario may not tell the whole story for the observed Na-O anticorrelations in globular clusters. Using the recent data by Carretta and his collaborators, the different shapes of the Na-O anticorrelations for red giant branch stars brighter than and fainter than the red giant branch bump can be clearly seen. If the elemental abundance measurements by Carretta and his collaborators are not greatly in error, this variation in the Na-O anticorrelation against luminosity indicates an internal deep mixing episode during the ascent of the low-mass red giant branch in globular clusters. Our result implies that the multiple stellar population division scheme solely based on [O/Fe] and [Na/Fe] ratios of a globular cluster, which is becoming popular, is not reliable for stars brighter than the red giant branch bump. Our result also suggests that sodium supplied by the deep mixing may alleviate the sodium <b>under-production</b> problem within the primordial asymptotic giant branch pollution scenario.

40|$|Biofuel {{production}} is not cost competitive and thus requires governmental intervention. The {{effect of the}} institutional framework {{on the development of}} the biofuel sector is not yet well understood. This paper aims to analyze how biofuel production and production capacity could have evolved in Germany in the period 1992 - 2014. The effects of an agricultural policy intervention (liberalization of the agricultural market) and a bioenergy policy intervention (a tax on biodiesel after an initial exemption) are explored. Elements of the Modeling Agent systems based on Institutional Analysis (MAIA) framework, complex adaptive systems (CAS) theory, and Neo Institutional Economics (NIE) theory were used to conceptualize and formalize the system in an agent-based model. It was found that an early liberalization of the agricultural market led to an <b>under-production</b> of biodiesel; a late liberalization led to the collapse of biodiesel production. An early introduction of the biodiesel tax led to stagnation in biodiesel production and production capacity; a late introduction led to an increase in sunk costs provided that the biofuel quota is binding. Also, a lack of agents' adaptation mechanism to forecast prices led to a decrease in patterns of biodiesel production when an external shock was introduced in the system. In sum, we argue that system behavior is influenced by individual behavior which is shaped by institutions. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
