The UT land area is slightly over one half the entire area of the State of Maine. Year-round residents in the UT number approximately 9,000, about 1.3% of the state's total population, with many more people residing only seasonally within the UT.

25|$|The Squatters' riot was an {{uprising}} and conflict {{that took place}} between squatting settlers {{and the government of}} Sacramento, California (then an <b>unorganized</b> <b>territory</b> annexed after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo) in August 1850 concerning the lands that John Sutter controlled in the region and the extremely high prices that speculators set for land that they had acquired from Sutter. The influx of squatters was a consequence of the 1848 California Gold Rush; when courts began to take legal action against squatters in the area, the squatters mobilized under Dr. Charles L. Robinson and Joseph Maloney and challenged mayor Hardin Bigelow and sheriff Joseph McKinney; the conflict was ultimately resolved, and the speculation in Sacramento ended as a result.|$|E

Senator James Pearce of Maryland drafted the final proposal in which Texas ceded its claims to land which later became half of present-day New Mexico, a third of Colorado, and small portions of Kansas, Oklahoma, and Wyoming to the federal government, {{in return for the}} assumption of $10 million of the old republic's debt.

25|$|The gold seekers {{organized}} the Provisional Government of the Territory of Jefferson on August 24, 1859, but this new territory failed to secure {{approval from the}} Congress of the United States embroiled {{in the debate over}} slavery. The election of Abraham Lincoln for the President of the United States on November 6, 1860, led to the secession of nine southern slave states and the threat of civil war among the states. Seeking to augment the political power of the Union states, the Republican Party-dominated Congress quickly admitted the eastern portion of the Territory of Kansas into the Union as the free State of Kansas on January 29, 1861, leaving the western portion of the Kansas Territory, and its gold-mining areas, as <b>unorganized</b> <b>territory.</b>|$|E
