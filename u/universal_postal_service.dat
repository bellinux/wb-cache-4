Apart from universal services Croatian Post also provides many other postal services: acceptance, directing, transport and delivery of direct mail, printed matter (books and prints), parcels, prepaid reply service (IBRS/CCRI mail), express mail services (EMS) and value-added services: hpekspres, business parcel and e-parcel.|$|R
40|$|In most {{member states}} of the European Union (EU), <b>universal</b> <b>postal</b> <b>services</b> {{provided}} by the incumbent operator are exempt from value added taxes (VAT) {{on the grounds that}} they are the Òpublic <b>postal</b> <b>service.</b> Ó Other <b>postal</b> <b>service</b> providers have to charge VAT at the standard rate. The paper sheds light on the main competitive impact of VAT policies while showing the consequences on overall welfare. We show that the results are very sensitive to the operatorsÕ labor policies. Consequently, VAT exemptions have a different impact in countries with different labor regulations. The comprehensive treatment of competition and welfare enables us to provide guidance on how to resolve the policy trade-off between consumer surplus, government tax revenue, and a level playing field in liberalized postal markets.

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "When GAO originally placed the U. S. <b>Postal</b> <b>Service's</b> (the Service) transformation efforts and long-term outlook on its high-risk list in early 2001, it was to focus urgent attention on the Service's deteriorating financial situation. Aggressive action was needed, particularly in cutting costs, improving productivity, and enhancing financial transparency. GAO testified several times since 2001 that comprehensive postal reform legislation was needed to address the Service's unsustainable business model, which assumed that increasing mail volume would cover rising costs and mitigate rate increases. This outdated model limited its flexibility and incentives needed to realize sufficient cost savings to offset rising costs, declining First-Class Mail volumes, unfunded obligations, and an expanding delivery network. This limitation threatened the Service's ability to achieve its mission of providing affordable, high-quality <b>universal</b> <b>postal</b> <b>services</b> on a self-financing basis. This testimony will focus on (1) why GAO recently removed the Service's transformation efforts and outlook from GAO's high-risk list, (2) the Service's financial condition in fiscal year 2007, (3) the opportunities and challenges facing the Service, and (4) major issues and areas for congressional oversight. This testimony is based on GAO's past work, review of the postal reform law, and updated information on the Service's financial condition. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the issues}} {{in the process of}} the EU <b>postal</b> <b>services</b> market liberalisation, which is in the final stage of its legal basis drafting process. The acceptance of the legal basis by competent EU institutions will largely define the <b>postal</b> <b>services</b> market liberalisation method, which is to be carried out by all EU Member States in a given period of time. For the final step of the liberalisation the authors (eu expert bodies) of the legal basis draft proposal have managed to maintain a relatively high standard of <b>universal</b> <b>postal</b> <b>services</b> (delivery every working day and at least five days a week for EU addresses, and short delivery times) and in addition to these also foreseen various financing methods. The latter are based on solutions taken from other sectors where the liberalisation process has been recently concluded and where a sector is also subject to the universal service obligation. Even though those financing models are more or less effective in other sectors, they have been subject to many concerns in a public debate on changes in postal sector. The key concerns relate to the foreseen mechanisms of universal service financing, the regulation of access to the public postal network, and the financing of the public postal network maintenance as well as development. The best way to overcome partially unproductive public debates on the issue is to start making factual and precise estimates of the effect of changes presented in this article by applying simplified financing mechanisms of the universal service. These mechanisms will need the input of specific data which will take into the account all relevant traits of every single EU Member State. liberalisation, universal service, directive, financing model, European Union...|$|R
