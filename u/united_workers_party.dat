5|$|Jagielski {{signed up}} to the Polish Workers' Party (PPR) in 1944, or in 1946 (sources vary). When the Polish Worker's Party {{transformed}} into the Polish <b>United</b> <b>Workers</b> <b>Party</b> (PZPR) in 1948, he {{became a member of}} the new party. From 1946 to 1949, Jagielski served on the Central Board of the Związek Samopomocy Chłopskiej (Association of Peasant Self-Help), a communist organization designed to take control of the countryside. From 1950 to 1952 he was on the Central Board of the State Agricultural Farms and from December 1952 to December 1953 he was a deputy director of that institution. In December 1953, he became the Director of the Agricultural Department of the Central Committee of the Polish <b>United</b> <b>Workers</b> <b>Party,</b> a position he would hold until December 1956.|$|E
5|$|In March 1954, {{he became}} a deputy {{to a member of}} the Central Committee of the Polish <b>United</b> <b>Workers</b> <b>Party</b> and would retain this {{position}} until March 1959. As a result of the January 1957 Polish legislative elections, Jagielski was appointed as a deputy to the Sejm, the Polish legislative body. In January of that year, he also became the Deputy Minister of Agriculture and was appointed as the Minister of Agriculture in October 1959, a position he would hold until June 1970. In March 1959, he was appointed a full member of the Central Committee of the Polish <b>United</b> <b>Workers</b> <b>Party</b> (he was previously a deputy to a full member). In June 1964, {{he became a}} deputy to a member of the Politburo of the Polish United Workers' Party and would hold that position until December 1971.|$|E
5|$|Saint Lucia gained full {{independence}} in 1979. Immediately beforehand, Odlum organised large protests {{in front of}} international news cameras, further cementing {{his role in the}} region's communist and socialist movement. Three weeks after independence, the nearby country of Grenada saw the overthrow of its government by communists revolutionaries led by Maurice Bishop. When the <b>United</b> <b>Workers</b> <b>Party</b> called a general election in Saint Lucia three weeks later, Compton's government fell – Odlum was returned to Parliament and the Labour Party, led by Allan Louisy, came to power.|$|E
50|$|Trepczyński {{joined the}} Lodz Committee of the Polish <b>Workers</b> <b>Party</b> (later the Polish <b>United</b> <b>Worker's</b> <b>Party)</b> in 1946. In 1951, {{he became the}} {{secretary}} of the Polish peace committee. He was appointed deputy minister of foreign affairs in 1971. From 1972 to 1973 he served as the 27th president of the United Nations General Assembly.|$|R
50|$|Spasowski {{served as}} {{an officer in the}} Polish Army {{division}} formed in the Soviet Union under Gen. Zygmunt Berling. Intensely loyal to Poland and convinced that Communism held great promise for his homeland, he joined the Polish <b>United</b> <b>Worker's</b> <b>Party,</b> the official Communist party in Poland, and entered government service almost immediately after the war. In time, Spasowski served on the Central Auditing Commission, which maintained and audited the party's finances.|$|R
50|$|He would succumb in {{the tumultuous}} {{defeat of the}} <b>United</b> <b>Worker's</b> <b>Party</b> in the 1997 {{election}} where he was defeated by George Odlum on a St Lucia Labour Party ticket. The results of the election show Odlum overcoming the incumbent 3960 to 2604, the lowest number of votes King would ever gain in an election. He took a nine year sabbatical from elective politic although remaining Chairman of the party {{for most of this}} period.|$|R
5|$|Louisy {{had become}} Prime Minister {{thanks to a}} secret {{agreement}} with Odlum that he would resign, allowing Odlum to take over, within 6 months. When the time came Louisy refused, backed by the Americans, who wanted to keep Odlum out of office at all costs. This saw Odlum turn against his own government and even vote against the budget. A second proposal that Louisy resign was rejected on 30 December 1980, with the power struggle continuing despite his agreement to hand over some of his portfolios. The dispute continued into 1981, with Odlum attracting controversy by announcing on 3 March {{that he had not}} ignored the possibility of his grouping within the Labour Party splitting and joining the <b>United</b> <b>Workers</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E
5|$|Siwiec's timing {{has been}} {{described}} as unfortunate, as he chose to commit his act during a dance (mazurka), at which time his cry was muffled due to the sounds of an orchestra playing. Some, like Tomas Kavaliauskas or Krzysztof Kąkolewski, have speculated that if he had chosen to act moments earlier, during a speech by Polish communist leader Władysław Gomułka, first secretary of the Polish <b>United</b> <b>Workers</b> <b>Party,</b> the commotion he caused would have likely interrupted it and his message might have been witnessed more widely. Publicist Antoni Zambrowski noted that many other self-immolators like Czech Jan Palach had cooperated with anti-communist opposition movements and left messages and other documents which helped publicize their activities; Siwiec worked alone and so the Polish anti-communist opposition with which he identified with was not aware of his action and the meaning behind it until much later.|$|E
5|$|The {{result was}} the 1981 {{dismissal}} of Odlum as Deputy Prime Minister and the resignation of Louisy. Louisy was succeeded not by Odlum, but by Winston Cenac, who himself resigned eight months later on 16 January 1982. Cenac was succeeded by Michael Pilgrim in an attempt by moderates in the Labour Party to avoid the possibility of Odlum leading the country. By this point Odlum had left the party, forming the Progressive Labour Party (PLP). Pilgrim's government also collapsed, necessitating an early general election in 1982 in which the Labour Party was left with only 3 of the 17 seats, returning the <b>United</b> <b>Workers</b> <b>Party</b> to government and seeing Odlum dismissed from Parliament. His Progressive Labour Party won only a single seat.|$|E

50|$|In 1945, the ZHP {{restored}} {{its former}} name {{and returned to}} public existence. However, the communist authorities of Poland pressured the organization {{to become a member}} of the Pioneer Movement, and eventually, in 1949, banned it, while its members joined the Polish <b>United</b> <b>Worker's</b> <b>Party</b> as a result. A new organization under the same name was created by communist government after the death of Soviet premier Joseph Stalin on the basis of membership of the government-sponsored Scouts of the Working Youth of Poland organization (Organizacja Harcerska Związku Młodzieży Polskiej or ZMP-OH).|$|R

25|$|In April 1980 a new European {{conference was}} held in Paris, but under {{different}} terms. The principle of consensus was gone at the Paris conference, and the Italian, Romanian, Spanish, Yugoslav, Icelandic, British, Dutch and Sammarinese communist parties boycotted the event. The French Communist Party, co-sponsors of the meeting together with the Polish <b>United</b> <b>Workers</b> <b>Party,</b> rejected {{the notion that the}} Paris meeting would have been of a similar kind as the Berlin conference as no common positions on strategy had been approved.|$|E
500|$|In July 1981, Jagielski {{lost his}} {{memberships}} in the Central Committee of the Polish <b>United</b> <b>Workers</b> <b>Party,</b> the Politburo of the Polish United Workers and the Economic Committee. He remained a deputy to the Sejm until 1985. He {{died on the}} night of 27 February 1997, from a heart attack in his home, in Warsaw, Poland, at the age of 73. After Jagielski's death, Lech Wałęsa described him as a [...] "sensitive man who always listened to arguments", and said that Jagielski differed in that respect from other Polish politicians in 1980.|$|E
500|$|Odlum's {{faction of}} the Labour Party {{did most of the}} work in the election, {{building}} their power base among the banana-producing small farmers, with Odlum leading frequent strikes in an attempt to improve working conditions. His work in the 1974 election, along with his [...] "good looks and charisma", yielded a safe seat in Castries, which he allowed his brother to run for. Odlum instead chose to campaign for a rural seat held by the <b>United</b> <b>Workers</b> <b>Party,</b> which he lost by a small margin. Despite the Labour Party still being in opposition in Saint Lucia, socialism and left-wing politics were on the rise in the Caribbean as a whole and, during his time out of Parliament, Odlum was the public face of socialism in the region.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{decisions}} of the Polish government declaring the Solidarity trade union illegal, the OPZZ was created on 24 November 1984 according to the 1982 trade union act which made trade union pluralism illegal. The OPZZ inherited all of Solidarity's property, and was part of the pro-government Patriotic Movement for National Revival (Patriotyczny Ruch Odrodzenia Narodowego - PRON). In 1985 it joined the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU). Until 1990 the OPZZ was tied closely to the Polish <b>United</b> <b>Worker's</b> <b>Party</b> (PZPR). Following the end of communist rule in Poland the federation aligned with various post-communist and social-democratic parties (e.g. Democratic Left Alliance, SLD).|$|R
50|$|Sokolovsky's {{political}} trajectory {{took him}} from the Zionist Socialist <b>Workers</b> <b>Party</b> through the <b>United</b> Jewish Socialist <b>Workers</b> <b>Party</b> (on the central committee of which he served) before joining the Bund and finally becoming {{a member of the}} Communist Party.|$|R
50|$|After the war, Jerzy, who has survived, has {{enlisted in}} the Peoples’ Army of Poland (LWP), which is under the {{complete}} control of the pro-Soviet Polish <b>United</b> <b>Worker's</b> <b>Party.</b> He feels personal loyalty to his friends, loves his country, and has sympathy {{for those who have}} suffered. He visits Anna and her daughter to tell them that Andrzej is dead. Apparently, when the list of the names of the victims was compiled, Andrzej was misidentified as Jerzy {{on the basis of the}} name in the sweater that Jerzy had lent to Andrzej; it was Andrzej who was killed, not Jerzy. Despondent that he is now forced to acknowledge a lie and to serve those who killed his comrades in Katyn, Jerzy commits suicide.|$|R
500|$|Parliamentary {{elections}} {{were held in}} Poland on 20 January 1957. They were the second election to the Sejm – the unicameral parliament of the People's Republic of Poland, and the third {{ever in the history}} of Communist Poland. It took place during the liberalization period, following Władysław Gomułka's ascension to power. Although conducted in a more liberal atmosphere than previous elections, they were far from free. Voters had the option of voting against some official candidates; de facto having a small chance to express a vote of no confidence against the government and the ruling Communist Polish <b>United</b> <b>Workers</b> <b>Party.</b> However, as in all Communist countries, there was no opportunity to elect any true opposition members to the Sejm. [...] The elections resulted in a predictable victory for the Front of National Unity, dominated by the PZPR.|$|E
500|$|During {{the early}} 1960s, St Lucia {{and the other}} West Indies Associated States were British colonies, with a limited degree of self-rule. In St Lucia, the Saint Lucia Labour Party was {{considered}} the traditional party for [...] "political and constitutional advance" [...] but, despite this, it lost the general election in 1964 to the <b>United</b> <b>Workers</b> <b>Party,</b> a right-wing party led by John Compton that continued to rule until 1979. In response Odlum, a socialist, founded the Saint Lucia Forum, a pressure group that discussed [...] "the socialist and black cultural ideas which were beginning to challenge the Caribbean status quo". This {{was part of a}} group of Forums established in 1970 following secret talks with other left-wing Caribbean intellectuals, including Maurice Bishop. In 1972 Odlum left his job with the Council of Ministers to form the St Lucia Action Movement, which later merged with a weakened Labour Party in time for the 1974 general election.|$|E
500|$|Jagielski {{became a}} {{communist}} deputy {{to the legislative}} body of Poland, the Sejm, in 1957, and {{he would continue to}} serve in that capacity for seven consecutive terms until 1985. In 1959, he was posted {{to be a member of}} the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party and appointed to be the Minister of Agriculture. After he left his position as Minister of Agriculture in 1970, Jagielski became a Deputy Prime Minister, and the next year, a member of the Politburo of the Polish United Workers' Party. In August 1980, Jagielski represented the government during talks with strikers in the city of Gdańsk. He negotiated the agreement which recognized Solidarity, a Polish trade union, as the first officially recognized independent trade union within the Eastern Bloc. Between August 1980 and August 1981, Jagielski continued to interact with representatives of Polish workers, though his health was declining during this period. In late July 1981, Jagielski was fired from the Deputy Premiership, reportedly because he failed to produce a recovery program for the economic crisis Poland was experiencing at that time. The same year, he left his membership of the Political Bureau of the Polish <b>United</b> <b>Workers</b> <b>Party</b> and the Central Committee. [...] He died in Warsaw, Poland from a heart attack at the age of 73.|$|E
5000|$|In March 1968 student-led {{demonstrations in}} Warsaw (Polish 1968 {{political}} crisis) gave Gomułka's government {{an excuse to}} channel public anti-government sentiment into another avenue. Thus his security chief, Mieczysław Moczar, used the situation as a pretext to launch an anti-Semitic press campaign (although the expression [...] "Zionist" [...] was officially used). The state-sponsored [...] "anti-Zionist" [...] campaign resulted in the removal of Jews from the Polish <b>United</b> <b>Worker's</b> <b>Party</b> and from teaching positions in schools and universities. Due to economic, political and police pressure, 25,000 Jews were forced to emigrate during 1968 - 1970. The campaign, though ostensibly directed at Jews who had held office in the Stalinist era and at their families, affected {{most of the remaining}} Polish Jews, whatever their backgrounds.|$|R

A UB official, Józef Światło, (born Izaak Fleichfarb), after escaping in 1953 to the West, exposed through Radio Free Europe the methods of the UB which led to its dissolution in 1954.

This was widely believed in regard to the Deering at the time, particularly by hardline anti-communists in the government. Though an intriguing suggestion, no definitive proof that any of these activities were actually carried out has surfaced.|$|R
