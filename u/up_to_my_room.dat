60|$|I think I'll go <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room.</b> I keep {{to my old}} {{habit of}} a siesta after luncheon.|$|E
60|$|ELLIE. I'm too tired. I'll take a book <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> {{and rest}} a little. [She {{goes to the}} bookshelf].|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{you come}} <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> {{and take your}} things off?" [...] enquired Mrs. Church, {{returning}} the old ladyâ€™s hostile stare with interest.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ferdinand," [...] he said, [...] "I {{am glad to}} {{see that}} you are better. Come <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> for a few minutes. We must have a talk." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It can't be done," [...] Pritchard declared, {{taking his}} arm once more. [...] "You've {{got to see}} me through this. Come <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> for a minute." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms,</b> will you?" [...] he asked. [...] "There's {{something}} I {{want to say}} to you. And then I'll {{walk back}} with you." [...] She was staying at a small hotel off Jermyn Street.|$|R
6000|$|I hurried <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room.</b> There {{was a note}} upon my dressing-table. I tore it hastily open. A {{few lines}} only, hastily {{scribbled}} in pencil:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If you please,' said Helen. 'Will {{you come}} <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room?</b> I keep all my own things there, {{out of the}} way of the critics.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You fellers go {{into the}} theatre, 'cause I ain't quite ready yet, an' I'll go <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> to think over one or two things." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} you," [...] said Ives, {{with a slow}} smile. [...] "Well, I think I will {{be going}} <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> now. If you would dine with me here one evening soon, Mr. Forster, I'd be glad." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will bring}} me back a line from my sister in reply to this," [...] said Armand, whom {{circumstances}} had at last rendered cautious. [...] "Bring it <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> that I may give you the five louis in exchange." ...|$|R
6000|$|We {{had been}} making a call {{together}} that evening, and afterward Tom ran <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> for a pipe and a chat before going on to his own luxurious apartments. I had stepped {{into the other room}} for a moment when I heard Tom sing out: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Absolutely. I {{used to get}} two {{or three}} a day sometimes. Whenever I went <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room,</b> I'd find another waiting for me on the dressing-table." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You can go <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> {{and help}} me stow away some baggage," [...] he said, glancing around {{as if to make}} certain they were not observed.|$|E
6000|$|... "He never lets me come {{in when he}} {{has these}} attacks," [...] said Meta. [...] "If he only would! But will you come <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room?</b> That is nearer." ...|$|E
60|$|It is a pleasure, my dears, {{when writing}} of that hour of bitterness, {{to record the}} moments of {{sweetness}} which lightened it. As I climbed <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> in Dover Street, I heard merry sounds above, and {{a cloud of smoke}} blew out of the door when I opened it.|$|R
6000|$|... "To be sure. That's {{the way to}} be revenged. Hetty," [...] he added, {{turning to}} the artist, who alone of the {{observers}} had smiled instead of groaned at the old gentleman's startling suggestion, [...] "will you kindly run <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> and get a red leather case that lies under the shell cabinet? Thank you, my dear." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{began to}} tell the story of Charlie in English, but Grish Chunder put a {{question}} in the vernacular, and the history went forward naturally in the tongue best suited for its telling. After all it could never have been told in English. Grish Chunder heard me, nodding from time to time, and then came <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> where I finished the tale.|$|R
60|$|I left Jacky peeking {{still and}} I went to bed. After {{a long time}} Aunt Tommy came <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> {{and sat down on}} my bed in the moonlight.|$|E
6000|$|L. Isabel--or Lily--run <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> and fetch me {{the little}} {{box with a}} glass lid, {{out of the top}} drawer of the chest of drawers. (Race between LILY and ISABEL.) ...|$|E
6000|$|Carl was perspiring at {{the thought}} of what the Gang would do to him when they {{discovered}} that he had invited Genie. But he was game. [...] "Come <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> whenever you can, and help me with my boning," [...] he added. [...] "You mustn't ever get the idea that we're conferring any blooming favor by having you around. It's you that help us. Our necks are pretty well sandpapered, I'm afraid.... Come <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> any time.... I'll have to be hiking on if I'm going to get much of a walk. Come over and see me to-night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Off--nothing," [...] whispered Colonel Pepper, drawing Lane aside. [...] "Swann and his strong-arm gang {{just got}} foxy. They quit for a while. Now they're rushing {{the girls in}} there--say from four to five--and in the evenings a little while, not too late. Oh, they're the slick bunch, picking out the ice cream soda hour when everybody's downtown.... You run <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> right now. And I'll gamble----" ...|$|R
60|$|There {{was once}} a medical student who came <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> early in the session, and I proved to him {{in half an hour}} that he did not exist. He got quite frightened, and I can still see his white face as he sat staring at me in the gloaming. This shows what metaphysics can do. He has recovered, however, and is sheep-farming now, his {{examiners}} never having asked him the right questions.|$|R
60|$|I went <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> wife's <b>room</b> {{and told}} her what the {{children}} had said of Tedham's call, {{and that he was}} coming back again.|$|R
6000|$|She looked round her. [...] "I {{hate this}} place. I hate these people," [...] she said. [...] "I wish you'd come <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> with me. I {{do want to}} talk to you." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{walked me}} <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> slowly and gravely--I am certain {{he had a}} delight in that formal parade of {{executing}} justice--and when we got there, suddenly twisted my head under his arm.|$|E
6000|$|... "This was a {{visit from}} a gentleman {{of the name of}} Blessington, who was a {{complete}} stranger to me. He came <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> one morning, and plunged into business in an instant.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are under}} the charge of Mr. Athelney Jones, of Scotland Yard. He is going <b>to</b> bring you <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms,</b> and I shall ask you for a true account of the matter. You must make a clean breast of it, for if you do I hope that I may be of use to you. I think I can prove that the poison acts so quickly {{that the man was}} dead before ever you reached the room." ...|$|R
60|$|I went <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> dearie's <b>room,</b> all {{pale and}} shaking. When I went in {{she came to}} meet me, like a girl going to meet death.|$|R
60|$|We {{walked along}} the Embankment to Adelphi Terrace, where I took him <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms,</b> and seated him in my easy-chair near the window. As he sat down, one of the trains on the Metropolitan line whirred past the Terrace, {{snorting}} steam and whistling shrilly, after the fashion of Metropolitan engines generally. My mysterious stranger jumped back in alarm, {{and seemed to be}} afraid of some immediate catastrophe. There was absolutely no possibility of doubting it. The man had obviously never seen a locomotive before.|$|R
6000|$|... '"Oh, Mr. James!" [...] I said, [...] "if {{you love}} me {{have a cup of}} tea and some bread-and-butter sent <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room,</b> and tell the maid to show me the way to it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Rollo, [...] "I rather think I {{will go with}} you; but {{you must}} wait here for me a minute or two. I must go <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> first; but I will come {{directly}} down again." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{pronounced}} {{those words}} as if [...] "supper" [...] {{was a form}} of domestic offense, habitually committed by the men, and endured by the women. I followed the groom <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room,</b> not over-well pleased with my first experience of the farm.|$|E
6000|$|The Lady, {{shaking her}} head: [...] "Tea-roses are ghastly. I hate yellow roses. I {{would rather have}} black, and black is simply impossible. I shall {{have to tell you}} just what I want to do. I don't want <b>to</b> work <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> with the flowers; I want <b>to</b> work <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the young lady who is going to pour tea for me. I don't care if there isn't a flower {{anywhere}} but on the table before her. I want a color scheme that shall not have a false note in it, from her face to the tiniest bud. I want them to all come together. Do you understand?" ...|$|R
60|$|On <b>my</b> way <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> own <b>room</b> I met Miss Halcombe on the stairs. She saw, by the hurry of my {{movements}} {{and the change}} in my manner, that I had some new purpose in view, and asked what had happened.|$|R
60|$|He {{carried the}} {{phonograph}} himself <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> sitting <b>room</b> and adjusted it for me. Now I shall learn something pleasant, I am sure. For it {{will tell me}} {{the other side of}} a true love episode of which I know one side already.|$|R
