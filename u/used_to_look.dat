5|$|The oldest form of {{astronomy}}, optical or visible-light astronomy {{extends from}} approximately 400 to 700 nm. Positioning an optical telescope in space {{means that the}} telescope does not see any atmospheric effects (see astronomical seeing), providing higher resolution images. Optical telescopes are <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at stars, galaxies, planetary nebulae and protoplanetary disks, amongst many other things.|$|E
5|$|Most strokes {{result from}} loss of blood supply, {{typically}} {{because of an}} embolus, rupture of a fatty plaque or narrowing of small arteries. Strokes can also result from bleeding within the brain. Transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) are strokes in which symptoms resolve within 24 hours. Investigation into the stroke will involve a medical examination (including a neurological examination) and the taking of a medical history, focusing on {{the duration of the}} symptoms and risk factors (including high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and smoking). Further investigation is needed in younger patients. An ECG and biotelemetry may be conducted to identify atrial fibrillation; an ultrasound can investigate narrowing of the carotid arteries; an echocardiogram can be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for clots within the heart, diseases of the heart valves or the presence of a patent foramen ovale. Blood tests are routinely done as part of the workup including diabetes tests and a lipid profile.|$|E
25|$|Selected {{laboratory}} tests can be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for associated problems or possible tumor spread. These include: full blood count, protein electrophoresis, antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor (indicative of myasthenia), electrolytes, liver enzymes and renal function.|$|E

25|$|Radiographs (x-rays) are {{sometimes}} <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for sand and enteroliths. Due {{to the size}} of the adult horse's abdomen, it requires a powerful machine that is not available to all practitioners. Additionally, the quality of these images is sometimes poor.|$|E
25|$|Often {{before the}} biopsy, the doctor asks for medical imaging {{to rule out}} other causes of woman's symptoms. Imaging {{modalities}} such as ultrasound, CT scan and MRI have been <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for alternating disease, spread of tumor and effect on adjacent structures. Typically, they appear as heterogeneous mass in the cervix.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, a {{bronchoalveolar lavage}} may {{be carried out}} - an {{endoscope}} is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> down the trachea, and mucus and cells are washed out of the lower airways for analysis. Typically, a BAL recovers an abnormally high percentage of neutrophils from an RAO horse - up to 50 or 70% in severe cases.|$|E

25|$|Sharon {{encourages}} Michelle to {{make amends}} with Martin and Ian, but neither of them are interested; Michelle talks to Bex, who says Michelle let herself down and the old Michelle that Bex <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> up to would hate this Michelle, and that she ruined everything she worked for; Michelle cries in Sharon's arms, saying she no longer knows herself. Ian eventually forgives Michelle but Martin still refuses to speak to her. Michelle attempts to find work in schools, without any luck. Stacey invites Michelle to a family meal but Martin says Michelle is only pretending to care about her family, and tells her {{that she is not}} the big sister he <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> up to. Michelle starts community service and hears that Tim wants a divorce, and she tries to avoid the issue. Eventually, Martin and Michelle start to talk again but he is still angry that she has behaved like a teenager. Michelle then realises that she needs to apply for other jobs so enquires about a sales assistant job, which she successfully obtains. Whilst travelling to work Michelle meets Tom Bailey (Daniel Casey) on the tube and she eventually gets the courage to ask him {{to go out on a}} date.|$|E
25|$|Schepens {{invented the}} {{binocular}} indirect ophthalmoscope (BIO), which is routinely <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the retina. His original BIO {{is now in}} the collection of the Smithsonian Institution. It has been reported that Schepens assembled the prototype for his BIO from metal scraps collected from the streets of London during the German blitz. He was also a pioneer of surgical techniques such as scleral buckling for the repair of retinal detachments. The use of these techniques has raised the success of retinal reattachment surgery from 40% to 90%. During his career, Schepens wrote four books and over 340 research papers.|$|E

25|$|Trypanosomes can be {{detected}} from patient samples using two different preparations. A wet preparation can be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for the motile trypanosomes. Alternatively, a fixed (dried) smear can be stained using Giemsa's or Field's technique and examined under a microscope. Often, the parasite is in relatively low abundance in the sample, so techniques to concentrate the parasites can be used prior to microscopic examination. For blood samples, these include centrifugation followed by examination of the buffy coat; mini anion-exchange/centrifugation; and the quantitative buffy coat (QBC) technique. For other samples, such as spinal fluid, concentration techniques include centrifugation followed by examination of the sediment.|$|E
25|$|In 2011 {{researchers}} from UC Berkeley published a study reporting second-by-second reconstruction of videos watched by the study's subjects, from fMRI data. This {{was achieved by}} creating a statistical model relating visual patterns in videos shown to the subjects, to the brain activity caused by watching the videos. This model was then <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> up the 100 one-second video segments, in a database of 18 million seconds of random YouTube videos, whose visual patterns most closely matched the brain activity recorded when subjects watched a new video. These 100 one-second video extracts were then combined into a mashed-up image that resembled the video being watched.|$|E
25|$|The {{top-down}} approach anticipates nanodevices {{that must be}} built piece by piece in stages, much as manufactured items are made. Scanning probe microscopy is an important technique both for characterization and synthesis of nanomaterials. Atomic force microscopes and scanning tunneling microscopes can be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at surfaces and to move atoms around. By designing different tips for these microscopes, {{they can be used}} for carving out structures on surfaces and to help guide self-assembling structures. By using, for example, feature-oriented scanning approach, atoms or molecules can be moved around on a surface with scanning probe microscopy techniques. At present, it is expensive and time-consuming for mass production but very suitable for laboratory experimentation.|$|E

25|$|The head tracker {{registers}} {{the translation}} and {{rotation of the}} user's head. Pointman uses these inputs to map {{the movements of the}} user's head and torso one-for-one to those of his avatar. The virtual view changes as the user turns his head to look around or leans his torso in any direction. When the weapon is raised into an aim position its sights remain centered in the field of view, so that turning the head also adjusts the aim. The user can aim as precisely as he can hold his head on target. Hunching the head down by flexing the spine is also registered by the head's translation, and the avatar adopts a matching posture. Leaning forward and hunching are used to duck behind cover. Rising up and leaning to the side are <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> out and shoot from behind cover.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} distinction made by any staging system {{is whether or}} not the cancer is still confined to the prostate. In the TNM system, clinical T1 and T2 cancers are found only in the prostate, while T3 and T4 cancers have spread elsewhere. Several tests can be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for evidence of spread. Medical specialty professional organizations recommend against the use of PET scans, CT scans, or bone scans when a physician stages early prostate cancer with low risk for metastasis. Those tests would be appropriate in such cases as when a CT scan evaluates spread within the pelvis, a bone scan look for spread to the bones, and endorectal coil magnetic resonance imaging to closely evaluate the prostatic capsule and the seminal vesicles. Bone scans should reveal osteoblastic appearance due to increased bone density in the areas of bone metastasis—opposite to what is found in many other cancers that metastasize.|$|E
25|$|On flight day 2, {{the crew}} of Endeavour {{completed}} several tasks {{in preparation for the}} docking on flight day 3. The first and most important of these tasks was surveying the shuttle's Thermal Protection System (TPS). The Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS) was used to survey the wing leading edge and nose cone. The Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS, or Canadarm 1) was also <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the thermal tiles and blankets on and around the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) pods. After the survey was complete, the Express Logistics Carrier (ELC) 3 was grappled by the SRMS. While the survey was conducted by Greg Johnson and mission specialists Roberto Vittori and Greg Chamitoff, {{the rest of the crew}} prepared the orbiter for docking. This included installing tools such as a center-line camera in the Orbiter Docking System, along with various other sensors used to gauge distance and speed. Kelly and mission specialists Mike Fincke and Drew Feustel furthermore checked out the two spacesuits carried on Endeavour, in preparation for the mission's four planned spacewalks.|$|E
