40|$|The {{objective}} of the proposed research is to analyze automated residential energy management technology using primary energy source utilization. A residential energy management system (REMS) is an amalgamation of hardware and software that performs residential energy <b>usage</b> <b>monitoring,</b> <b>planning,</b> and control. Primary energy source utilization quantifies power system levels impacts on power generation cost, fuel utilization, and environmental air pollution; based on power system generating constraints and electric load. 	Automated residential energy management technology performance is quantified through a physically-based REMS simulation. This simulation includes individual appliance operation and accounts for consumer behavior by stochastically varying appliance usage and repeating multiple simulation iterations for each simulated scenario. The effect of the automated REMS under varying levels of control will be considered. 	Aggregate REMS power system impacts are quantified using primary energy source utilization. This analysis uses a probabilistic economic dispatch algorithm. The economic dispatch algorithm quantifies: fuel usage and subsequent environmental air pollution (EAP) generated; based on power system generating constraints and electric load (no transmission constraints are considered). 	The analysis will comprehensively explore multiple residential energy management options to achieve demand response. The physically-based REMS simulation will consider the following control options: programmable thermostat, direct load control, smart appliance scheduling, and smart appliance scheduling with a stationary battery. The ability to compare multiple automated residential energy management technology options on an equal basis will guide utility technology investment strategies.

Within the last six years, a transmission diagnostics research team was formed to address current and future technology barriers in transmission diagnostics. The diagnostics team conducted a survey to determine critical needs of the diagnostics community. Survey results indicated that experimental verification of gear and bearing fault detection methods and damage magnitude assessment were considered the two most critical research areas of a highly reliable health and <b>usage</b> <b>monitoring</b> system. A <b>plan</b> was implemented by the diagnostics team to address these key research areas, by in-house research and university grants. A variety of transmission fault detection methods were applied to experimentally obtained fatigue data. Failure modes of the fatigue tests include a variety of gear pitting failures, tooth wear, tooth fracture, and bearing spalling failures. Accomplishments to date include verification of several specific gear diagnostic methods, verification of a new pattern recognition method to determine failure, and development of a new method to model gear tooth damage.

40|$|Helicopter Structural <b>Usage</b> <b>Monitoring</b> is a {{technology}} that is about {{ready to make a}} monumental change in the way dynamic components are managed in service. Instead of fixed retirement times based on the assumption of “worst case ” <b>usage,</b> Structural <b>Usage</b> <b>Monitoring</b> with Regime Recognition will allow individual components to be retired based on their individual usage. For many operators this may allow extensions of the time in service of limited-life fatigue components, potentially by multiples of their current retirement times. However, just substituting actual usage for the worst case usage in a damage calculation would eliminate the safety margin provided by the worst case assumption – a margin of one of the approximately six “ 9 ’s ” of reliability that is normally provided. This paper shows how a <b>usage</b> <b>monitor</b> count of occurrences of critical flight regimes can be multiplied by a factor – The <b>Usage</b> <b>Monitor</b> Reliability Factor – to assure that structural reliability is maintained over the full range of possible usage scenarios. A critical tool – the Fatigue Reliability Assessment Model- was developed at Sikorsky to conduct the necessary statistical studies. This model allows very quick but accurate closed form estimates of fatigue reliability for complex helicopter scenarios, replacing the cumbersome “Monte-Carlo ” simulation approaches in use up to this time. Usage data from the Sikorsky S- 92 Civil Transport Helicopter is used to develop and evaluate the method. It is concluded that a <b>Usage</b> <b>Monitor</b> Reliability Facto...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{life-cycle}} {{environmental and}} usage conditions {{of a product}} or system can be monitored and analyzed to assess its on-going health, provide advance warning of failure, and provide information to improve the design and qualification of fielded and future products.

This paper presents methods to effectively collect and analyze life-cycle environmental and usage data for in-situ health assessments. An integrated hardware-software micro-programmable module for health and <b>usage</b> <b>monitoring</b> of electronic products in their application environment is presented.

The helicopter (a Bell Model 412 equipped with a Health and <b>Usage</b> <b>Monitoring</b> System (HUMS) and data recorder) was operated by Petroleum Helicopters Inc. (PHI) during the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta, Georgia, under the FAA’s Project HeliSTAR. The mission was referred to as the Atlanta Short Haul Mission (ASHM) and involved many short flights to provide pick up and delivery service at the Olympics. The usage data collected for the ASHM was used to perform fatigue life calculations and damage tolerance evaluations on selected rotor system components known as Principal Structural Elements (PSE’s). The usage data from the ASHM were compared to certification data and to data from a previous study for a mission called the Gulf Coast Mission (GCM) which involved primarily long cruise flights. Although the usage was more severe for the ASHM than the GCM, the results of the comparison showed that <b>usage</b> <b>monitoring</b> would provide benefits in extending retirement times or inspection intervals, compared to certification, especially if high/low altitude effects were considered.

In military aero engine applications, {{a portion of}} the safe crack propagation life is more and more utilised to extend the usage period beyond the limits set by the concept of safe crack initiation life.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the current}} {{environment}} of decreasing budgets, {{the need for}} an accurate and reliable fatigue <b>usage</b> <b>monitoring</b> system is of ever increasing importance to ensure the safe and economical utilisation of aircraft which are expected to last longer than ever before. Strain based in-flight data recorders are perceived to provide an increase in accuracy over the traditional fatigue g meter, and have thus been implemented by many military fleet operators worldwide particularly for agile aircraft. Although this may be the case, these new generation recorders and the systems required for fatigue damage interpretation are complex, and many problems are associated with their use. Military design requirements mandate the incorporation of fatigue monitoring data recorders, however the specifications allow much scope in the implementation of the system and interpretation of the data. Therefore, there exist numerous and varied philosophies for the <b>usage</b> <b>monitoring</b> of aircraft worldwide. This paper proposes a unified approach for fatigue <b>usage</b> <b>monitoring</b> of modern fighter aircraft and is based on experience primarily with the F/A- 18, and discusses the requirements for future fatigue monitoring systems based on strain and flight parameter measurements. Areas covered include the choice of gauge locations, need for flight parameters, data collection rates, calibration of damage models to durability tests, reliability of strain sensors, data integrity, and the in-flight calibration of strain sensors.
