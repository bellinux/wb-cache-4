5|$|One of {{the most}} {{extensively}} studied cerebellar learning tasks is the eyeblink conditioning paradigm, in which a neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) such as a tone or a light is repeatedly paired with an <b>unconditioned</b> <b>stimulus</b> (US), such as an air puff, that elicits a blink response. After such repeated presentations of the CS and US, the CS will eventually elicit a blink before the US, a conditioned response or CR. Experiments showed that lesions localized either to a specific part of the interposed nucleus (one of the deep cerebellar nuclei) or to a few specific points in the cerebellar cortex would abolish learning of a conditionally timed blink response. If cerebellar outputs are pharmacologically inactivated while leaving the inputs and intracellular circuits intact, learning takes place even while the animal fails to show any response, whereas, if intracerebellar circuits are disrupted, no learning takes place—these facts taken together make a strong case that the learning, indeed, occurs inside the cerebellum.|$|E
25|$|In {{classical}} (or respondent) conditioning, {{behavior is}} understood as responses triggered by certain environmental or physical stimuli. They can be unconditioned, such as in-born reflexes, or learned through the pairing of an <b>unconditioned</b> <b>stimulus</b> with a different stimulus, which then becomes a conditioned stimulus. In relation to motivation, classical conditioning {{might be seen as}} one explanation as to why an individual performs certain responses and behaviors in certain situations. For instance, a dentist might wonder why a patient does not seem motivated to show up for an appointment, with the explanation being that the patient has associated the dentist (conditioned stimulus) with the pain (<b>unconditioned</b> <b>stimulus)</b> that elicits a fear response (conditioned response), leading to the patient being reluctant to visit the dentist.|$|E
25|$|Respondent (classical) {{conditioning}} {{is based}} on innate stimulus-response relationships called reflexes. In his famous experiments with dogs, Pavlov usually used the salivary reflex, namely salivation (unconditioned response) following the taste of food (<b>unconditioned</b> <b>stimulus).</b> Pairing a neutral stimulus, for example a bell (conditioned stimulus) with food caused the bell to elicit salivation (conditioned response). Thus, in classical conditioning, the conditioned stimulus becomes a signal for a biologically significant consequence. Note that in respondent conditioning, unlike operant conditioning, the response does not produce a reinforcer or punisher (e.g. the dog does not get food because it salivates).|$|E

40|$|Classical {{conditioning}} {{of motor}} responses, {{such as the}} eyeblink response, is an experimental model of associative learning and of adaptive timing of movements. A conditioned blink will have its maximum amplitude near the expected onset of the <b>unconditioned</b> blink-eliciting <b>stimulus</b> and it adapts {{to changes in the}} interval between the conditioned and <b>unconditioned</b> <b>stimuli.</b> Previous studies have shown that an eyeblink conditioning protocol can make cerebellar Purkinje cells learn to pause in response to the conditioned stimulus. According to the cerebellar cortical conditioning model, this conditioned Purkinje cell response drives the overt blink. If so, the model predicts that the temporal properties of the Purkinje cell response reflect the overt behaviour. To test this prediction, in vivo recordings of Purkinje cell activity were performed in decerebrate ferrets during conditioning, using direct stimulation of cerebellar mossy and climbing fibre afferents as conditioned and <b>unconditioned</b> <b>stimuli.</b> The results show that Purkinje cells not only develop a change in responsiveness to the conditioned stimulus. They also learn a particular temporal response profile where the timing, not only of onset and maximum but also of offset, is determined by the temporal interval between the conditioned and <b>unconditioned</b> <b>stimuli...</b>|$|R
25|$|Classical {{conditioning}} {{is described}} as the pairing of a conditioned stimulus (CS) (such as a vibration) with an <b>unconditioned</b> <b>stimulus</b> (US) (such as a loud noise) to evoke a conditioned response (CR) (agitation). In this pairing, the vibration will be presented immediately followed by a loud noise. Initially, {{the presentation of the}} loud noise (US) would cause the unconditioned response (UR) (natural agitation) without prior classical conditioning. However, the continuous pairing of the loud noise (US) with the vibration (CS) converts the unconditioned response (UR) into a (CR) as the fetus learns that the presentation of a vibration will be followed by a loud noise. Eventually, the fetus will respond to the vibration (CS) without being exposed to the loud noise (US); this is when conditioning has occurred. Conditioning has been demonstrated in as few as 12-15 pairings of the vibration (CS) with the loud noise (US) in fetuses as early as 32 weeks of gestation.|$|E
2500|$|... a) Classical {{conditioning}} of fear. Initially {{the organism}} experiences the pairing of a CS (conditioned stimulus) with an aversive US (<b>unconditioned</b> <b>stimulus).</b> The theory assumes that this pairing creates {{an association between}} the CS and the US through classical conditioning and, because of the aversive nature of the US, the CS comes to elicit a conditioned emotional reaction (CER) – [...] "fear." [...] b) Reinforcement of the operant response by fear-reduction. As {{a result of the}} first process, the CS now signals fear; this unpleasant emotional reaction serves to motivate operant responses, and responses that terminate the CS are reinforced by fear termination. Note that the theory does not say that the organism [...] "avoids" [...] the US in the sense of anticipating it, but rather that the organism [...] "escapes" [...] an aversive internal state that is caused by the CS.|$|E
50|$|The timing {{between the}} {{conditioned}} and <b>unconditioned</b> <b>stimulus</b> is important. There {{are two types}} of approaches for eye blink conditioning when it comes to timing between the stimuli. The first is called delay conditioning, which is when the conditioned stimulus (tone) starts, then continues until the <b>unconditioned</b> <b>stimulus</b> (air puff) is released after a delay, then they both suspend at the same time. The other is called trace conditioning, where the conditioned stimulus (tone) is shorter and stops before the <b>unconditioned</b> <b>stimulus</b> (air puff) begins, leaving a gap between the two stimuli. This type of conditioning forces the subject, in this particular example, a bunny, to remember to link the conditioned stimulus with the <b>unconditioned</b> <b>stimulus.</b>|$|E
50|$|In neuropsychology, equipotentiality is a {{neurological}} principle that describes a cortical mechanism, first identified by Jean Pierre Flourens and later revisited by Karl Lashley in the 1950s.

30|$|In {{the present}} study, I {{evaluated}} my hypothesis by recording SPR and HR, which reflect emotion-related autonomic arousal (Palomba et al. 2000), {{in response to}} loud noises, which are <b>unconditioned</b> <b>stimuli</b> that induce negative emotions (Damasio et al. 1990), in healthy participants presented concomitantly with or without bilateral skin pressure {{to the sides of}} the chest.|$|R
40|$|SummaryStimuli that possess {{inherently}} rewarding or aversive qualities elicit {{emotional responses}} and also induce learning by imparting valence upon neutral sensory cues. Evidence has accumulated implicating the amygdala {{as a critical}} structure in mediating these processes. We have developed a genetic strategy to identify the representations of rewarding and aversive <b>unconditioned</b> <b>stimuli</b> (USs) in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and have examined their role in innate and learned responses. Activation of an ensemble of US-responsive cells in the BLA elicits innate physiological and behavioral responses of different valence. Activation of this US ensemble can also reinforce appetitive and aversive learning when paired with differing neutral stimuli. Moreover, we establish that the activation of US-responsive cells in the BLA {{is necessary for the}} expression of a conditioned response. Neural representations of conditioned and <b>unconditioned</b> <b>stimuli</b> therefore ultimately connect to US-responsive cells in the BLA to elicit both innate and learned responses...|$|R
5000|$|In the {{conditioning}} phase the <b>unconditioned</b> <b>stimulus</b> (e.g. morphine) {{is administered}} to the animal (usually a mouse or rat) in the treatment group. In {{this phase of the}} procedure the animal is only allowed access to one compartment of the apparatus. [...] This compartment will become associated with the motivational effects of the <b>unconditioned</b> <b>stimulus.</b> The environment will come to elicit approach or avoidance-withdrawal depending {{on the nature of the}} <b>unconditioned</b> <b>stimulus.</b> The conditioning procedure usually consists of eight or more five-minute sessions.|$|E
50|$|In Kamin's {{blocking}} effect the conditioning of {{an association between}} two stimuli, a conditioned stimulus (CS) and an <b>unconditioned</b> <b>stimulus</b> (US) is impaired if, during the conditioning process, the CS is presented together with a second CS {{that has already been}} associated with the <b>unconditioned</b> <b>stimulus.</b>|$|E
50|$|Without conditioning, {{there is}} already a {{relationship}} between the <b>unconditioned</b> <b>stimulus</b> and the unconditioned response.

50|$|Pavlov {{proposed}} that conditioning involved {{a connection between}} brain centers for conditioned and <b>unconditioned</b> <b>stimuli.</b> His physiological account of conditioning has been abandoned, but classical conditioning continues to be studied in attempts to understand the neural structures and functions that underlie learning and memory.

40|$|Detection {{of taste}} aversions induced by weak <b>unconditioned</b> <b>stimuli</b> like body rotarion. The main {{aim of the}} present study was to develop a {{behavioural}} procedure in order to detect mild taste aversions induced by body rotation and low doses of LiCl in Wistar rats. The proposed procedure involves a choice-test between tastes with different previous preferences. Experiment 1 a showed that, when decaffeinated coffee and cider vinegar are used, body-rotation induced aversions to the preferred coffee solution are evident during the choice-test only if the neophobic response to the lest preferred vinegar has been eliminated by a previous preexposure. A single preexposure before the choice-test is enough to eliminate neophobia (Experiment 1 b). In Experiment 2 the same procedure effectively detected mild aversions induced by i. p. injected low doses (0. 15 M; 0. 2 % b. w.) of LiCl. The relevance of the proposed procedure lies in its potential application to the psychobiological study of taste aversion learning and it is proposed as a specially sensitive behavioural tool for detecting mild aversions induced by weak <b>unconditioned</b> <b>stimuli,</b> like body rotarion...|$|R
50|$|In this paradigm, {{extinction}} {{occurs when}} the animal is re-exposed to the conditioned cue or conditioned context {{in the absence of}} the <b>unconditioned</b> <b>stimulus.</b> As the animal learns that the cue or context no longer predicts the coming of the <b>unconditioned</b> <b>stimulus,</b> conditioned responding gradually decreases, or extinguishes.|$|E
50|$|A neutral {{stimulus}} is {{a stimulus}} which initially produces no specific response other than focusing attention. In classical conditioning, when used {{together with an}} <b>unconditioned</b> <b>stimulus,</b> the neutral stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus. With repeated presentations of both the neutral stimulus and the <b>unconditioned</b> <b>stimulus,</b> the neutral stimulus will elicit a response as well, known as a conditioned response. Once the neutral stimulus elicits a conditioned response, the neutral stimulus becomes known as a conditioned stimulus.

50|$|Evaluative {{conditioning}} {{is defined}} as a change in the valence of a stimulus that is due to the pairing of that stimulus with another positive or negative stimulus. The first stimulus {{is often referred to as}} the conditioned stimulus and the second stimulus as the <b>unconditioned</b> <b>stimulus.</b> A conditioned stimulus becomes more positive when it has been paired with a positive <b>unconditioned</b> <b>stimulus</b> and more negative when it has been paired with a negative <b>unconditioned</b> <b>stimulus.</b> Evaluative conditioning thus refers to attitude formation or change toward an object due to that object's mere co-occurrence with another object.|$|E
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} number of neuroimaging studies using visual sexual stimuli (VSS) for human sexuality studies, including emerging field of research on compulsive sexual behaviors. A central question in this field is whether behaviors such as extensive pornography consumption share common brain mechanisms with widely studied substance and behavioral addictions. Depending on how VSS are conceptualized, different predictions can be formulated within the frameworks of Reinforcement Learning or Incentive Salience Theory, where a crucial distinction is made between conditioned (cue) and <b>unconditioned</b> (reward) <b>stimuli</b> (related to reward anticipation vs reward consumption, respectively). Surveying 40 recent human neuroimaging studies we show existing ambiguity about the conceptualization of VSS. Therefore, we feel {{that it is important to}} address the question of whether VSS should be considered as cues (conditioned <b>stimuli)</b> or rewards (<b>unconditioned</b> <b>stimuli).</b> Here we present our own perspective, which is that in most laboratory settings VSS play a role of reward (<b>unconditioned</b> <b>stimuli),</b> as evidenced by: 1.) experience of pleasure while watching VSS, possibly accompanied by genital reaction 2.) reward-related brain activity correlated with these pleasurable feelings in response to VSS, 3.) a willingness to exert effort to view VSS similarly as for other rewarding stimuli such as money, and/or 4.) conditioning for cues (CS) predictive for. We hope that this perspective paper will initiate a scientific discussion on this important and overlooked topic and increase attention for appropriate interpretations of results of human neuroimaging studies using VSS...|$|R

40|$|In most evaluative {{conditioning}} studies, the valence of the <b>unconditioned</b> <b>stimuli</b> is stable. We examined {{what happens}} when dramatic stories, of which the valence evolves over time, are used as <b>unconditioned</b> <b>stimuli.</b> In three experiments, we tested {{the hypothesis that the}} conditioning effect of stories depends on the valence of the ending, even when the beginning is of the opposite valence. Experiment 1 (N = 61) used a 2 × 3 within-participants design. Unknown consumer brands were paired with either good-ending or bad-ending stories, and the presentation of the brands was either before the beginning, before the ending, or after the ending. On both an implicit and an explicit attitude measure, we found that brands paired with good-ending stories were liked more than brands paired with bad-ending stories, and this effect was largest for brands presented after the ending. In Experiment 2 (N = 131), the explicit attitude results were replicated in a larger sample. In Experiment 3 (N = 127), the order of story segments was reversed such that the ending was told before the beginning. The conditioning effect was replicated and as in Experiment 1 and 2, the conditioning effect was largest for brands presented after the ending (now told first). We discuss the theoretical as well as practical implications of these findings...|$|R

50|$|Classical {{conditioning}} {{occurs when}} a conditioned stimulus (CS) is paired with an <b>unconditioned</b> <b>stimulus</b> (US). Usually, the conditioned stimulus is a neutral stimulus (e.g., {{the sound of a}} tuning fork), the <b>unconditioned</b> <b>stimulus</b> is biologically potent (e.g., the taste of food) and the unconditioned response (UR) to the <b>unconditioned</b> <b>stimulus</b> is an unlearned reflex response (e.g., salivation). After pairing is repeated (some learning may occur after only one pairing), the organism exhibits a conditioned response (CR) to the conditioned stimulus when the conditioned stimulus is presented alone. The conditioned response is usually similar to the unconditioned response (see below), but unlike the unconditioned response, it must be acquired through experience and is relatively impermanent.|$|E
50|$|In {{classical}} or respondent conditioning, {{a relatively}} neutral stimulus (conditioned stimulus) comes {{to signal the}} occurrence of a biologically significant stimulus (<b>unconditioned</b> <b>stimulus)</b> such as food or pain.

5000|$|Terminology for {{classical}} conditional {{has also}} been developed.
