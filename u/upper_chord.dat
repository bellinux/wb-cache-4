25|$|As the 1930s {{turned to}} the 1940s, Parker went to New York as a {{featured}} player in the Jay McShann Orchestra. In New York he found other musicians who were exploring the harmonic and melodic limits of their music, including Dizzy Gillespie, a Roy Eldridge-influenced trumpet player who, like Parker, was exploring ideas based on <b>upper</b> <b>chord</b> intervals, beyond the sevenths that had traditionally defined jazz harmony. While Gillespie was with Cab Calloway, he practiced with bassist Milt Hinton and developed {{some of the key}} harmonic and chordal innovations that would be the cornerstones of the new music; Parker did the same with bassist Gene Ramey while with McShann's group. Guitarist Charlie Christian, who had arrived in New York with the Benny Goodman Orchestra in 1939 was, like Parker, an innovator extending a southwestern style. Christian's major influence was in the realm of rhythmic phrasing. Christian commonly emphasized weak beats and off beats and often ended his phrases on {{the second half of the}} fourth beat. Christian experimented with asymmetrical phrasing, which was to become a core element of the new bop style..|$|E

2500|$|In May 1920, Holton D. Robinson (b. 1863, Massena, NY, d. 1945, {{engineer}} of the Williamsburg Bridge) contacted Steinman {{and requested}} that they join forces {{to create a}} design for the Florianópolis Bridge (or Hercilio Luz Bridge, 1926) in Florianópolis, Brazil. After getting advice from Charles Fowler, Steinman agreed and they formed the firm of [...] in 1921, a partnership that lasted until the 1940s. They did not win the contract immediately but continued to collaborate on it and other projects. The early 1920s were considered a tough time for bridge construction, so Steinman tried to design his bridges to be economically pleasing rather than artistic, without sacrificing the structural integrity of the bridge. For example, Robinson and Steinman changed the original plans for the Florianopolis bridge, using eyebar chains as the <b>upper</b> <b>chord</b> of the stiffening truss instead of the conventional wire-cable. The new design produced a very stiff bridge with much less material than the original plan. Other bridge engineers {{would also have to}} take this new economical design into account when competing with Steinman. Steinman was well regarded in the profession and had a reputation for good presentations and for being politically astute.|$|E

50|$|Essentially, the Yenisei bridge {{opened up}} {{a new era in}} Russian bridge engineering. Proskouriakov's statically {{determinate}} trusses with subdivided panels and upward-angled <b>upper</b> <b>chords</b> were subsequently widely used by many other bridge engineers.

There is a ventilating gap in the roof above the centreline, protected by a raised sheetmetal ridge capping which is semi-circular in section. The curved roof has no guttering; water simply runs off into concrete drains {{on either side of the}} building.|$|R
5000|$|Structurally, {{the bridge}} is a bowstring tied arch with two {{separate}} yet identical spans supported by end abutments and a center pier of mortared cut limestone blocks.

50|$|By {{the end of}} 1940, the {{erection}} of the cantilevered arms was commenced and {{was completed}} in mid-summer of 1941. The two halves of the suspended span, each 282 feet (86 m) long and weighing 2,000 tons, were built in December 1941. The bridge was erected by commencing at the two anchor spans and advancing towards the center, {{with the use of}} creeper cranes moving along the <b>upper</b> <b>chord.</b> 16 hydraulic jacks, each of which had an 800-ton capacity, were pressed into service to join the two halves of the suspended span.|$|E

50|$|In 1892, {{the third}} Sixth Street Bridge {{was built by}} an {{engineer}} named Theodore Cooper for the Union Bridge Company. The main spans were 440 ft long, each having through trusses of the camel-back type with upward-angled <b>upper</b> <b>chords,</b> and were twice {{as wide as the}} previous bridge. In 1927 the bridge had to be taken apart because the steelwork was too brittle for safety. So in 1927, the main spans were somewhat trimmed down temporarily from their 80 ft height which were then lowered onto barges and floated down the Ohio River to the back channel of Neville Island {{to become part of the}} Coraopolis Bridge. Finally in 1994 the steel was scrapped.|$|R
50|$|The bridge had {{a central}} span (46.80 meter long) with {{external}} platforms and an <b>upper</b> parabolic <b>chord</b> supported by tubular cells, and eight additional spans of 11.25 m each supported on metallic girders.

Material of all components is steel S 235. All calculations were performed in accordance with valid standards. The structure consists of a load-bearing columns fixed to the ground, the truss girders are designed of hollow cross-sections, pin-suported by the columns. The purlins are pin supported by <b>upper</b> <b>chords</b> of a truss girder, with the lower and upper edges flushing. Purlins support the roof made of roof-panels by Kingspan, thickness 160 mm. Wall casing the technical parts of the object is formed also by system panels by Kingspan. The cladding of the sales area is made of glass panels by Reynaers...|$|R
50|$|Construction was {{overseen by}} Gustav Lindenthal, whose {{original}} design left a gap of 15 ft between the steel arch and the masonry towers. Fearing {{that the public}} assumed that the towers were structurally integral to the bridge, Lindenthal added aesthetic girders between the <b>upper</b> <b>chord</b> of the arch and the towers to make the structure appear more robust. The original plans for the piers on the long approach ramps called for a steel lattice structure. The design was changed to smooth concrete to soothe concerns that asylum inmates on Wards and Randall's islands would climb the piers to escape.|$|E
50|$|The {{bridge is}} a riveted steel eight-panel single span {{camelback}} pony truss bridge on a rural section of M-86. The bridge is 90 feet long, with a 32.8-foot-wide concrete deck and a 27 feet wide roadway. Five I-beams support the floor. The <b>upper</b> <b>chord</b> is constructed with back-to-back channels with lattice, while the lower chord and verticals are constructed from {{two pairs of}} angles with a plate in the middle. A metal guard rail serves as a railing. The bridge is supported with concrete abutments, and U-shaped concrete wing walls line the approach on each side.|$|E
50|$|The Pegram truss is {{a hybrid}} between the Warren and Parker trusses where the upper chords {{are all of}} equal length and the lower chords are longer than the {{corresponding}} <b>upper</b> <b>chord.</b> Because {{of the difference in}} upper and lower chord length, each panel is not square. The members which would be vertical in a Parker truss vary from near vertical {{in the center of the}} span to diagonal near each end (like a Warren truss). George H. Pegram, while the chief engineer of Edge Moor Iron Company in Wilmington, Delaware, patented this truss design in 1885.|$|E
50|$|The phrase tasto solo {{indicates}} {{that only the}} bass line (without any <b>upper</b> <b>chords)</b> is to be played for a short period, usually until the next figure is encountered. This instructs the chord-playing instrumentalist not to play any improvised chords for a period.The reason tasto solo had to be specified was {{because it was an}} accepted convention that if no figures were present in a section of otherwise figured bass line, the chord-playing performer would either assume that it was a root position triad, or deduce from the harmonic motion that another figure was implied. For example, if a continuo part in the key of C begins with a C bass note in the first measure, which descends to a B in the second measure, even if there were no figures, the chord-playing instrumentalist would deduce that this was most likely a first inversion dominant chord (spelled B-D-G, from bottom note of the chord to the top).|$|R
50|$|Sometimes {{both the}} <b>upper</b> and lower <b>chords</b> support roadbeds, forming a double-decked truss. This {{can be used}} to {{separate}} rail from road traffic or to separate the two directions of automobile traffic and so avoiding the likelihood of head-on collisions.|$|R

50|$|Designing the bridge, Proskouriakov {{proposed}} a new constructive solution — an original trussed girder. By using featheredge design for its <b>upper</b> <b>chord</b> (similar to Schwedler truss), Proskouriakov extended {{the height of}} the main trusses up to 21.64 m. The engineer also utilized the theory of influence lines for truss analysis that enabled more accurate calculation of internal forces in every member in a truss due to moving loads. Since then, the theory of influence lines for truss analysis has been used in engineering both in Russia and around the world. Incidentally, the Yenisei bridge was the first in Russia, during the construction of which the incremental launching method was applied for the first time.|$|E
50|$|The {{bridge is}} {{supported}} by two fieldstone abutments and a pier. Its two spans are identical in construction, with one being much longer than the other.

Its <b>upper</b> <b>chord</b> is a riveted steel girder supported by lattice-braced members riveted to the flanges of the plate girder. The lower chord consists of two double wrought iron tension bars. The central panel is cross-braced with wrought-iron tie rods. All joints, not just in this span but the main one as well, are secured by threaded iron pins two inches (5 cm) wide capped with hexagonal nuts.|$|E
