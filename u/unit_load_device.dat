25|$|A <b>unit</b> <b>load</b> <b>device</b> (ULD) is a pallet or {{container}} used to load luggage, freight, {{and mail}} on wide-body aircraft and specific narrow-body aircraft. It allows a large quantity of cargo to be bundled {{into a single}} unit. Since this leads to fewer units to load, it saves ground crews time and effort and helps prevent delayed flights. Each ULD has its own packing list (or manifest) so that its contents can be tracked.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, {{there were}} about 20.5million {{intermodal}} containers {{in the world of}} varying types to suit different cargoes. Containers have largely supplanted the traditional break bulk cargo – in 2010 containers accounted for 60% of the world's seaborne trade. The predominant alternative methods of transport carry bulk cargo – whether gaseous, liquid or solid – e.g. by bulk carrier or tank ship, tank car or truck. For air freight, the more light-weight IATA-defined <b>unit</b> <b>load</b> <b>device</b> is used.|$|E

50|$|When baggage is {{checked in}} at the ticket counter or with a sky cap (where it {{receives}} a bag tag indicating the passenger's itinerary), it is often placed onto a moving bag belt which carries the baggage to the bag room.

The bag tag which was previously affixed to the baggage during check-in is then read by a baggage handler and placed into the proper bag cart (usually a 4-wheeled trailer) or <b>Unit</b> <b>Load</b> <b>Device</b> (ULD; a machine-loadable container). The bag cart or ULD is then eventually pulled from the bag room by a bag tug and out to the aircraft for loading by baggage handlers.|$|E

50|$|After the {{introduction}} of the operationally and logistically more economical Boeing 767-223SF in March 2010, First Air retired and removed its two Boeing 727-233 aircraft from its fleet. One was one of only two combi types in the world, and the last 727-200 in North America on scheduled passenger-freight services. The other 727-233F full freighter has also been phased out. A Hawker Siddeley HS 748 turboprop (C-GFNW) was retired in March 2011. Replacing this aircraft type are two ATR 72 Combi turboprops as part of First Air's fleet replacement program. They are outfitted with a cargo handling system, and one is outfitted with a large cargo door. A first of its kind in North America, it is able to handle built <b>Unit</b> <b>Load</b> <b>Device</b> positions.

The aviation industry adopted ULD/pallets to be lightweight containers and supporting platforms respectively, intended to be loaded into aircraft and fly along with their loads, they need to be minimum in weight and thus do not have wheels or strong base structure. Also, the ULD/pallets have stringent dimensional standard following the aircraft cargo bay dimension. Therefore, these dollies are custom designed to complement the ULD/pallet's dimension, hinge/fixture position, weak overall physical strength and transportation need. Advanced dollies for ULD and pallets, such as those used on an airport apron, may have the following specialized facilities.|$|E
