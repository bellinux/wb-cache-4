In the truss, the lower horizontal member (the bottom chord) and the <b>upper</b> <b>horizontal</b> member (the top chord) carry tension and compression, fulfilling the same function as the flanges of an I-beam. Which chord carries tension and which carries compression depends on the overall direction of bending. In the truss pictured above right, the bottom chord is in tension, and the top chord in compression.|$|E

25|$|The Viastra was envisaged as a one or three-engined {{commercial}} aircraft {{capable of carrying}} ten passengers and designed {{with an eye to}} operations in countries with poor surface transport facilities. Vickers built several variants, largely similar apart from the engines: ultimately, there were Viastras with one, two and three engines. They were high-wing monoplanes, the wings having constant chord, square tips and a thick Raf 24 section. The wings, {{like the rest of the}} aircraft were covered with the corrugated skin and carried balanced ailerons and outboard slots. There was a biplane tail unit with a pair of narrow chord planes, the lower attached to the fuselage underside and the upper mounted clear above. The outboard vertical tail surfaces were again very narrow and served as the main rudders; the single-engined and tri-motor variants also had a small triangular central fin, carrying an auxiliary rudder and supporting the <b>upper</b> <b>horizontal</b> plane. With one exception, the twin-engined Viastras had the central fin and rudder replaced by tubular bracing.|$|E

50|$|During the Cold War, {{the risks}} {{associated}} with using escalation were much broader and more diverse, due to the intensity of the current world events. Counterinsurgency and counter-terrorist operations were very prone to using horizontal escalation as a means of defense. Those two types of warfare are more likely to lead to horizontal escalation, because the area of conflict widens in efforts to eliminate enemy holdings or to punish other parties that support their enemy. In an era of such high intensity, in order to gain an <b>upper</b> hand, <b>horizontal</b> escalation was implemented.|$|R
2500|$|The Grunau 9 {{had almost}} rectangular, two spar, wooden structured, two piece wings with fabric {{covering}} everywhere except the leading edges, which were plywood covered. Short, simple rectangular, cropped ailerons reached {{to the square}} wing tips. [...] They were attached to the upper fuselage beam with their leading edges at the forward sloping member and a chordwise gap between their roots. [...] Each wing was braced {{with a pair of}} landing wires from the apex of the A-frame to the upper wing at outboard points on the forward and aft spars and by pairs of flying wires from [...] below the wing to the lower horizontal A-frame member. There were also bracing wires from the wing rear spars to the tail to retrain its lateral movement. [...] The vertical rudder hinge {{was at the end of}} the fuselage, with a rudder that was rectangular apart from its sloping lower edge. [...] A triangular tailplane was mounted on the <b>upper,</b> <b>horizontal</b> fuselage beam with the elevator hinge in line with the rudder's. [...] The rectangular elevators therefore required a cut-out for rudder movement; like the rudder and tailplane, the elevators were fabric covered. [...] A fin was provided by fabric covering the near triangular area of the rear fuselage between the rudder hinge, the upper and lower beams and the diagonal between them.|$|E
