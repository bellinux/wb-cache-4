5|$|After the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union, the economy went into decline and the population quickly started to decrease. Between 1989 and 2002, Murmansk Oblast lost almost a quarter of its population; and almost 100,000 more between 2002 and 2010. Nevertheless, the economy rebounded somewhat {{in the first decade of}} the 2000s and the peninsula remains the most industrially developed and <b>urbanized</b> <b>region</b> in northern Russia.|$|E
5|$|After the {{economic}} slump of the 1990s, {{the economy of}} the oblast started to rebound during {{the first decade of the}} 2000s, although at a rate below the country's average. Today the Kola Peninsula is the most industrially developed and <b>urbanized</b> <b>region</b> in northern Russia. The major port of the peninsula is Murmansk, which serves as the administrative center of Murmansk Oblast and does not freeze in winter. Although the strategic importance of the Kola Peninsula has diminished since the Cold War, the peninsula nevertheless still has the highest concentration of nuclear weapons, reactors, and facilities in Russia, with the number of nuclear reactors alone exceeding any other region of the world.|$|E

25|$|A lot of {{controversy}} exists concerning the division of 19 municipalities for a highly <b>urbanized</b> <b>region,</b> which is considered as (half of) one city by most people. Some politicians mock the '19 baronies' and want to merge the municipalities under one city council and one mayor. This would lower the number of politicians needed to govern Brussels, and centralise the power over the city to make decisions easier, thus reduce the overall running costs. The current municipalities could be transformed into districts with limited responsibilities, similar to the current structure of Antwerp or to structures of other capitals like the boroughs in London or arrondissements in Paris, to keep politics {{close enough to the}} citizen.|$|E
2500|$|Southern California {{consists}} of a heavily developed urban environment, {{home to some of}} the largest urban areas in the state, along with vast areas that have been left undeveloped. With over 22 million people, roughly 60% of California's population resides in Southern California. It is the second-largest <b>urbanized</b> <b>region</b> in the United States, second only to the Washington/Philadelphia/New York/Boston Northeastern Megalopolis. [...] Whereas these cities are dense, with major downtown populations and significant rail and transit systems, much of Southern California is famous for its large, spread-out, suburban communities and use of automobiles and highways. The dominant areas are Los Angeles, Orange County, San Diego, and Riverside-San Bernardino, each of which is the center of its respective metropolitan area, composed of numerous smaller cities and communities. The urban area is also host to an international metropolitan region in the form of San Diego–Tijuana, created by the urban area spilling over into Baja California.|$|E
2500|$|Murie {{was born}} on March 1, 1889, in Moorhead, Minnesota, the child of Norwegian immigrants. Growing up in this less <b>urbanized</b> <b>region</b> helped foster a love for the {{wilderness}} from an early age. Murie studied biology at Fargo College, private liberal arts college of the Congregational Church. When his [...] zoology professor moved to Pacific University in Oregon, he offered Murie a scholarship to transfer there, where he completed studies in zoology and wildlife biology and was graduated in 1912. He did graduate work at the University of Michigan and was granted an M.S. in 1927. He {{began his career as}} an Oregon State conservation officer and participated in scientific explorations of Hudson Bay and Labrador, financed by the Carnegie Museum. He joined the U.S. Bureau of Biological Survey (now the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) in 1920 as a wildlife biologist, spending the next 6 years in the field with his brother Adolph Murie, studying Alaskan caribou, mapping migratory routes and estimating numbers. He married Margaret Thomas in 1924 in Anvik, Alaska. They spent their honeymoon tracking caribou through the Koyukuk River region.|$|E

40|$|Globalization and {{changing}} mobility patterns have significantly altered the urban landscapes of Latin America {{over the past}} decades. Efforts {{by the state and}} the private sector to regenerate urban areas and free up land for the sake of investment and wealthy city dwellers have shaped processes of privatization and socio-spatial segregation. While ‘privileged mobilities’ such as lifestyle migration can be assumed {{to play a role in}} such urban transformations, research on the link between urban change and lifestyle migration in Latin America is still in its infancy. This paper focuses on the impact of lifestyle migration on the extent and speed of socio-spatial change in intermediate cities and <b>urbanizing</b> <b>regions.</b> More concretely, the paper underscores the importance of lifestyle migration in shaping contemporary urban space in Latin America by comparing socio-spatial transformations in Cuenca, an intermediate city in southern Ecuador, and the urbanizing coast of Guanacaste province in northwest Costa Rica. These research sites currently are two of Latin America's main destinations for international lifestyle migrants, and hence are experiencing escalating real estate development. Both areas have developed into increasingly exclusivist spaces and as such show that intermediate cities and <b>urbanizing</b> <b>regions</b> can no longer escape the spatial segregation, gentrification and inequality that used to be associated almost solely with metropolitan centers.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{attempts}} {{to assess the}} influence of changing land-use patterns on the groundwater quality of the hard rock aquifer system in the Maheshwaram watershed, near Hyderabad, India. The study area is a rapidly <b>urbanizing</b> <b>region</b> with land development progressing at a fast pace. To study {{the impact of this}} rapid urbanization and overall land-use transition, a groundwater quality index (GQI) was prepared within a geographical information system (GIS). The GQI integrates the different water quality parameters to give a final index value {{that can be used for}} spatio-temporal comparisons. The land-use transitions were closely monitored from 2003 to 2008 using multispectral satellite images. The land-use pattern has changed drastically with an increase in the built-up area at the expense of other land uses. The analysis reveals a rapid deterioration of groundwater quality related mainly to the increase in built-up land with unsewered sanitation and poultry farms. Seasonal variability of the groundwater quality was also assessed. Mean GQI decreased from 84. 16 to 83. 26 over a period of 5 years from 2003 to 2008, while seasonal variability of water quality increased. GQI and Seasonal Variability of water quality were integrated in GIS to yield a groundwater sustainability map, in terms of water quality. Zones of sustainable and unsustainable groundwater use were demarcated for better decision making related to municipal land allotment in this rapidly <b>urbanizing</b> <b>region...</b>|$|R
40|$|Local {{labour market}} areas (LLMAs) are usually defined {{on the basis}} of total {{commuting}} flows between constituent ‘building block’ areas. Indeed the 1984 revision of Travel-To-Work Areas (TTWAs) was based on aggregate flows between 1981 Census wards. It is widely recognized, however, that various sub-groups of the population have distinctive commuting patterns. TTWAs therefore represent the outcome of an ‘averaging’ of the journey-to-work patterns of different gender, socio-economic and occupational groups. In this preliminary review, the self-containment of TTWAs in England and Wales, which have been generated using aggregate data, is assessed at the simplest level of disaggregation of the commuting data: disaggregation by gender. In accordance with expectations, it is found that TTWAs defined {{on the basis of}} total commuting flows are generally more self-contained for females than for males, and that those TTWAs which are insufficiently self-contained to be considered as LLMAs for males are overwhelmingly concentrated in the most <b>urbanized</b> <b>regions.</b> These findings are reinforced by the results of re-running the TTWA regionalization algorithm against 1981 flow data for males and females in order to create gender-specific TTWAs; disparities between Male and Female TTWAs are greatest in the most <b>urbanized</b> <b>regions.</b> Such differences are investigated in greater detail for two Metropolitan Regions (MRs) : the combined Liverpool and Manchester MRs in the north-west and the London MR in the south-east...|$|R
