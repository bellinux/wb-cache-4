5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the eighth series, Kryten's nanobots reconstruct the Red Dwarf, which they had broken down into its constituent atoms. In the process, the entire crew of the ship – including a pre-accident Rimmer – are resurrected, but the Starbug crew find themselves sentenced to two years in the ship's brig (at first, for crashing a Starbug and bringing onboard Kryten and Cat as stowaways, but later for <b>using</b> <b>information</b> from the confidential files). The series ends with a metal-eating virus loose on Red Dwarf. The entire resurrected crew evacuates save the original dwarfers. In the cliffhanger ending, Rimmer is left stranded alone to face Death (and promptly knees him in the groin and flees).|$|E
40|$|Proper <b>use</b> <b>information</b> is {{necessary}} to do exposure modelling in the scope of regulatory risk assessments. The legal regime under which the regulatory risk assessment is done influences the need for <b>use</b> <b>information.</b> Different legal regimes lead to more or less possibilities for authorities to define the exposure scenario to be assessed and the data to be presented by the industrial parties involved. The more information is required by the regulations, the less <b>use</b> <b>information</b> has to be gathered or guessed at by the regulatory exposure assessor. The value of <b>use</b> <b>information</b> is further determined by {{the scope of the}} assessment. A very conservative first tier (screening) assessment requires little information, whereas a detailed assessment of actual risks requires accurate <b>use</b> <b>information.</b> The scientific knowledge and available models limit the benefits of <b>use</b> <b>information.</b> Interesting <b>use</b> <b>information</b> has little value if there are no methods to account for the information in the exposure assessment, e. g. if relations between possible exposure determinants and exposure levels are unknown. The need for <b>use</b> <b>information</b> will further be dependent on the analysis of costs (of gathering data) versus benefits (increase in quality of the assessment). Many choices regarding the need for <b>use</b> <b>information</b> depend on policy choices by decision-makers. These decision-makers again depend on proper scientific information to make informed choices. © 2001 British Occupational Hygiene Society. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

5|$|Japan's {{vulnerability}} to blockade was studied. <b>Using</b> <b>information</b> {{supplied by the}} Board of Trade and the naval attaché in Tokyo, the planners estimated that the British Empire accounted for around 27 per cent of Japan's imports. In most cases these imports could be replaced from sources in China and the United States. However, certain critical materials for which Japan relied heavily on imports were identified, including metals, machinery, chemicals, oil and rubber, {{and many of the}} best sources of these were under British control. Japan's access to neutral shipping could be restricted by refusing insurance to ships trading with Japan, and chartering ships to reduce the number available.|$|E

Michael thanks Locke for hunting the boar and then asks Locke about the Monster, but Locke says that he did not see anything.

5|$|Proteins are {{assembled}} from {{amino acids}} <b>using</b> <b>information</b> encoded in genes. Each protein {{has its own}} unique amino acid sequence that is specified by the nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding this protein. The genetic code {{is a set of}} three-nucleotide sets called codons and each three-nucleotide combination designates an amino acid, for example AUG (adenine-uracil-guanine) is the code for methionine. Because DNA contains four nucleotides, the total number of possible codons is 64; hence, there is some redundancy in the genetic code, with some amino acids specified by more than one codon. Genes encoded in DNA are first transcribed into pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) by proteins such as RNA polymerase. Most organisms then process the pre-mRNA (also known as a primary transcript) using various forms of Post-transcriptional modification to form the mature mRNA, which is then used as a template for protein synthesis by the ribosome. In prokaryotes the mRNA may either be used as soon as it is produced, or be bound by a ribosome after having moved away from the nucleoid. In contrast, eukaryotes make mRNA in the cell nucleus and then translocate it across the nuclear membrane into the cytoplasm, where protein synthesis then takes place. The rate of protein synthesis is higher in prokaryotes than eukaryotes and can reach up to 20 amino acids per second.|$|E

5|$|Rogers {{recruits}} Barnes, Dum Dum Dugan, Gabe Jones, Jim Morita, James Montgomery Falsworth, and Jacques Dernier {{to attack}} other known Hydra bases. Stark outfits Rogers with advanced equipment, most notably a circular shield made of vibranium, a rare, nearly indestructible metal. Rogers {{and his team}} sabotage various Hydra operations. The team later assaults a train carrying Zola. Rogers and Jones succeed in capturing Zola, but Barnes falls from the train to his assumed death. <b>Using</b> <b>information</b> extracted from Zola, the final Hydra stronghold is located, and Rogers leads an attack to stop Schmidt from using {{weapons of mass destruction}} on major American cities. Rogers climbs aboard Schmidt's aircraft as it takes off, and during the subsequent fight the Tesseract's container is damaged. Schmidt physically handles the Tesseract, causing him to dissolve in a bright light. The Tesseract burns through the plane and is lost in the ocean. Seeing no way to land the plane without the risk of detonating its weapons, Rogers crashes it in the Arctic. Stark later recovers the Tesseract from the ocean floor but is unable to locate Rogers or the aircraft, presuming him dead.|$|E
5|$|The Bulgarians, <b>using</b> <b>information</b> from escaped {{prisoners of}} war, {{determined}} that Entente forces would engage in hostile actions west of lake Ohrid, in Monastir, Dobro Pole or Human.

By 7 September, Dobro Pole was reinforced by one machine gun company, six battalions and ten heavy howitzers, the head of Army Group Scholtz General Friedrich von Scholtz then stated that the defensive measures made {{the defense of the}} front feasible. Scholtz had failed {{to take into account the}} departure of Bulgarian chief of staff Nikola Zhekov and his subsequent replacement by Georgi Todorov. Widespread insubordination and desertions also plagued the Bulgarian troops who refused to participate in fortification works; poor rations and fatigue contributed to the low morale.|$|E

Covarrubias' aid is sought when Mulder attempts to reach Tunguska in Russia to investigate the source of a further black oil contamination. Whilst there, Mulder is held in a gulag and used as a successful test subject for a black oil vaccine. He escapes and is able to return to America, having found that Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) is working with the Russians.|$|E
