5000|$|Cory Doctorow, {{author and}} {{sometime}} Electronic Frontier Foundation activist, {{has described the}} process of the switch as <b>unwiring,</b> a move away from a global internetwork, which in reality passes through many chokepoints where data may be controlled and inspected, toward one which uses available bandwidth frugally by passing communications in a mesh and avoiding chokepoints. He and Charles Stross wrote a collaborative short story Unwirer on the process.|$|E

Additionally, since each actuator requires about 100 mA for its actuation in current implementation, downsizing, <b>unwiring,</b> and power-saving technology is essential for the deployment from place to place in living space.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a dynamic adaptation process for multi-cloud applications that {{is composed of}} two phases. The first one is a modeling phase, which borrows the ability for representing commonalities and variabilities from the software product lines (SPL) paradigm. In this phase, a customized model feature specifies the configuration of cloud services {{to be used by}} an application (commonalities) and the different possible providers for each service (variabilities). The second phase is an implementation phase, which relies on the Mape-K autonomic loop to define the steps of an adaptation strategy and a centralized knowledge management provides the proper inputs for each step. Finally, in order to make easier the task of developing the adaptation process itself, the current implementation of the adaptation strategy relies on the FraSCAti component framework, which allows performing wiring and <b>unwiring</b> operations between components...|$|E
40|$|Deep {{foundation}} pit will cause settlement of surround {{buildings in the}} process of excavation. When the settlement is excessive, it will give rise to safety issues. Subsidence monitoring has become an important measure {{to ensure the safety of}} deep {{foundation pit}}s. But in current subsidence monitoring engineering, the costs of wiring, <b>unwiring</b> and installation are particularly high. This paper proposes a portable wireless data transmission device in forecasting and early warning of settlement deformation of soils around deep foundation pits. We solve the problem by adopting the means of wireless communication to replace the cable transmission link part. The device does not rely on any personal computers. Instead, it can directly deal with the collected data through grey prediction GM (1, 1) mathematical model, neural network and interpolation model to give short-term, medium- term and long-term forecasts, respectively. Additionally it is able to set a threshold value. Once the forecast data reach the threshold, the device can issue alert and achieve the target of reminding technicians, so as to provide reliable basis to prevent and reduce disasters...|$|E
40|$|The {{world is}} <b>unwiring</b> itself at an {{astonishing}} rate. Wireless access points {{are on the}} rise world-wide. New modulation schemes are making it possible to do more with less bandwidth. Next generation wireless networks promising unprecedented data transfer rates are around the corner. With all this high speed infrastructure being laid, it is only natural to observe that we will use our wireless devices more and more. We will have higher expectations of our devices to be inconspicuously portable and have Olympic endurance. Manufacturers are quickly realizing that size and run time demands of their portable equipment can not be met by increasing energy density in batteries or even improving power management efficiency – the improvements in these technologies are saturating. To achieve the leap in wireless devices ’ functionality and run time, manufacturers are turning to high efficiency energy management of system functions. Decreasing the amount of energy it takes to complete a function means the battery has more energy left for other processes. This energy management philosophy is being developed for several common wireless functional blocks such as DSP and processor calculations, and the transmitter power amplifier. In particular, innovative ways o...|$|E

40|$|Our aim is {{to explain}} a way to {{construct}} categories of games by combining 2 -dimensional structures called playpens. We use a running example of a category of games based on digraphs. We explain some basic properties of digraphs, including a construction of a tensor product on this category {{by means of a}} promonoidal structure on the category consisting of a parallel pair of maps. We describe a corefiective subcategory of the category of digraphs which is naturally thought of as a category of trees. To motivate the 2 -dimensional structures we shall use, we introduce the concept of <b>unwiring.</b> This formalises the idea of a structure whose elements can be decomposed over the shapes provided by a monad. We show that this construction picks out a well-behaved class of exponentiable objects, and allows the lifting of exponentiation functors to categories of algebras. We explore the details of the special case of this construction for free multicategory monads. Examining what happens for the free fc-mulicategory monad leads to the introduction of playpens. We explore simple constructions and examples of playpens, and show how these may be used to produce an fc-multicategory of games based on digraphs. We outline the theory of represent ability for fc-multicategories, and we demonstrate that the fc-multicategory we've produced underlies a strict double category, whose horizontal part is a standard category of games. We explore a link between this construction and slicing in fc-multicategories. We explain how to modify the construction so far to produce categories with different conventions for play, with different notions of strategy, and with different combinatorial notions of game (including trees of the kind mentioned earlier). By means of these examples, we hope to indicate the variety of potential further extensions of our construction. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
