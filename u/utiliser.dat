Middle Eastern countries also record this species in their hauls, but at lower amounts of between 50 and 5000 t. In more southerly regions such as South Africa, it is a rare catch, usually appearing in beach seines. The species is taken by a variety of netting methods such as beach seines, trawls, purse seines and other types of trap including hook and line. It is usually marketed fresh, dried or salted. Torpedo scad are often caught by recreational fishermen throughout their range, however are not considered a target for gamefishing. They readily take small lures and are good sport on light tackle. Torpedo scad are said to have fair to good quality flesh, however are not very popular. Some chefs recommend frying or steaming the fish, although grilling is also acceptable. In polluted waters it has been demonstrated the fish contain higher than acceptable levels of heavy metals, and should be avoided in such regions. Torpedo scad are often used as live baits for larger gamefish.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{analyses}} simple {{models for}} "production-utilisation" systems, reduced to two state variables for producers and <b>utilisers,</b> respectively. Two modes are distinguished: in "harvester" systems the resource utilisation involves active seeking {{on the part}} of the <b>utilisers,</b> while in "processor" systems, <b>utilisers</b> function as passive material processors. An idealised model of biosphere-human interactions provides an example of a harvester system, and a model of plant and soil carbon dynamics exemplifies a processor system. The biosphere-human interaction model exhibits a number of features in accord with experience, including a tendency towards oscillatory behaviour which in some circumstances results in limit cycles. The plant-soil carbon model is used to study the effect of random forcing of production (for example by weather and climate fluctuations), showing that with appropriate parameter choices the model can flip between active-biosphere and dormant-biosphere equilibria under the influence of random forcing. This externally-driven transition between locally stable states is fundamentally different from Lorenzian chaos. A basic behavioural difference between processor and harvester forms of producer-utiliser system is that harvester systems tend toward oscillatory behaviour (though they do not always do so), while processor systems do not have this tendency...|$|R
40|$|Movile Cave, Romania, is {{an unusual}} {{underground}} ecosystem that has been sealed off {{from the outside world}} for several million years and is sustained by non-phototrophic carbon fixation. Methane and sulfur-oxidising bacteria are the main primary producers, supporting a complex food web that includes bacteria, fungi and cave-adapted invertebrates. A range of methylotrophic bacteria in Movile Cave grow on one-carbon compounds including methylated amines, which are produced via decomposition of organic-rich microbial mats. The role of methylated amines as a carbon and nitrogen source for bacteria in Movile Cave was investigated using a combination of cultivation studies and DNA stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) using 13 C-monomethylamine (MMA). Two newly developed primer sets targeting the gene for gamma-glutamylmethylamide synthetase (gmaS), the first enzyme of the recently-discovered indirect MMA-oxidation pathway, were applied in functional gene probing. SIP experiments revealed that the obligate methylotroph Methylotenera mobilis is one of the dominant MMA <b>utilisers</b> in the cave. DNA-SIP experiments also showed that a new facultative methylotroph isolated in this study, Catellibacterium sp. LW- 1 {{is probably one of the}} most active MMA <b>utilisers</b> in Movile Cave. Methylated amines were also used as a nitrogen source by a wide range of non-methylotrophic bacteria in Movile Cave.

In 1978, at Alma - Ata WHO and UNICEF jointly declared the primacy of the primary health care (PHC) approach for achieving the WHO's social goal, " health for all the people by the year 2000 ". Since then, PHC has become a major concern on national and international levels. Saul Arabia one of the countries which has adopted and implemented the PHC approach. This study explores the implementation of the PHC approach, the utilisation of health services delivered at the health centres and health awareness in Jeddah, a major urban centre in Saudi Arabia, where public and private health services co-exist and compete, and where traditional medicine is still used and practised. A sample comprising both <b>utilisers</b> of the PHC centres and non- <b>utilisers</b> were questioned about their health practices, beliefs and attitudes, and an attempt was made to determine whether socio- economic and demographic characteristics were significantly related to utilisation and health awareness. No single pattern of attitude or behaviour was found to be consistently related to socio-economic or demographic characteristics. However, the findings indicate the general significance of education. The nature of service provision was found to affect satisfaction and a need was found {{to improve the quality of}} the health service and to remove bureaucratic barriers which impede utilisation. Although many aspects of PHC are successfully implemented, there is evidence of misunderstandings of the approach by both consumers and providers, which limits both utilisation and satisfaction. In particular providers and users still prioritises curative above preventive medicine, health education is still neglected, and the potential of the media in this respect is under-exploited.

40|$|Humic {{substances}} (HS) might influence planktonic food chains {{in lakes}} in two ways: 1) by altering the physical or chemical environment and thus modifying autotrophic primary {{production and the}} dependent food chains; 2) by acting as a direct carbon/energy source for food chains. HS compete with phytoplankton for available quanta underwater and this effect {{is seen in the}} reduced euphotic zone depth in lakes with high concentrations of HS. Thus potential photosynthetic production is lower in the presence of HS. However, this effect can be offset in small lakes in which the depth of mixing is also reduced when HS concentrations are high. Complexation by HS of important nutrients such as iron and phosphorus may also restrict primary production. Evidence is accumulating that photosynthetic primary production is insufficient to support measured metabolic activity in humic lakes, which implies that metabolism of allochthonous HS underpins much of the observed activity. Studies of bacterial abundance and growth in the presence of HS support the view that bacteria are the most significant <b>utilisers</b> of HS. This use is apparently facilitated by photolysis of HS, particularly by short wavelength radiation. Bacteria are grazed by both micro-zooplankton (heterotrophic and mixotrophic flagellates and ciliates) and macrozooplankton. It is within this microbial community that the food chains derived from autotrophic and allotrophic sources interact. These effects of HS on food chains are discussed in relation to possible implications for the response of different lake types to eutrophication...|$|R

Bacterial communities within the large intestine of three groups of horses were compared using oligonucleotide-RNA hybridisation methodology. Each group consisting of six horses was maintained on (1) a grass-only diet, (2) a concentrate diet (i. e. supplemented with hydrolysable carbohydrates) and (3) a concentrate diet but horses were affected by simple colonic obstruction and distension (SCOD), a prevalent form of dietary-induced intestinal disease. We show that in response to dietary change and intestinal disease, there is a progressive and significant increase in Lachnospiraceae, the Bacteroidetes assemblage and the lactic acid-producing, Bacillus-Lactobacillus-Streptococcus (BLS) group. In contrast, there is a corresponding decrease in the proportion of obligate fibrolytic, acid-intolerant bacteria, Fibrobacter and Ruminococcaceae. Assessment of monocarboxylic acids indicated that there are significantly higher concentrations of lactic acid in the colonic contents of horses maintained on a concentrate diet and those suffering from SCOD, correlating with the observed increase in the population abundance of the BLS group. However, the population size of the Veillonellaceae (lactate <b>utilisers)</b> remained constant in each study group.

In this randomized trial high utilizers of primary care where treated in a 6 month intervention programme providing pharmacotherapy, standardized education and counselling for physicians and patients. This group was compared to a treatment as usual group. The practices were randomized, a 6 month follow up was attached. 63 patients of 31 primary care practices were treated.

Methods This paper presents design {{and methods of}} the study "Effectiveness and Cost-Effectiveness of Needs-Oriented Discharge Planning and Monitoring for High <b>Utilisers</b> of Psychiatric Services" (NODPAM), a multicentre RCT conducted in five psychiatric hospitals in Germany. Inclusion criteria are receipt of inpatient psychiatric care, adult age, diagnosis of schizophrenia or affective disorder, defined high utilisation of psychiatric care during two {{years prior to the}} current admission, and given informed consent. Consecutive recruitment started in April 2006. Since then, during a period of 18 months, comprehensive outcome data of 490 participants is being collected at baseline and during three follow-up measurement points. The manualised intervention applies principles of needs-led care and focuses on the inpatient-outpatient transition. A trained intervention worker provides two intervention sessions: (a) Discharge planning: Just before discharge with the patient and responsible clinician at the inpatient service; (b) Monitoring: Three months after discharge with the patient and outpatient clinician. A written treatment plan is signed by all participants after each session. Primary endpoints are whether participants in the intervention group will show fewer hospital days and readmissions to hospital. Secondary endpoints are better compliance with aftercare, better clinical outcome and quality of life, as well as cost-effectiveness and cost-utility. Discussion If a needs-oriented discharge planning and monitoring proves to be successful in this RCT, a tool will be at hand to improve patient outcome and reduce costs via harmonising fragmented mental health service provision.

40|$|A severe burn is {{a trauma}} fraught with stress and pain and {{may change the}} entire course of life. This thesis focuses on care utilisation, care {{experiences}} and patient satisfaction after a severe burn. The patients studied were treated at the Burn Unit at Uppsala University Hospital between 1980 and 2006. Burn-related health was examined using the Burn Specific Health Scale-Brief (BSHS-B), personality traits with the Swedish universities Scales of Personality (SSP), psychological symptoms using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS), symptoms of posttraumatic stress with the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and satisfaction with care using the Patient Satisfaction-Results and Quality (PS-RESKVA) questionnaire. Those utilising care years after injury reported poorer functioning on three of the BSHS-B subscales. Personality traits had {{a greater impact on}} care utilisation than injury severity. Social desirability was lower among care <b>utilisers</b> and was associated with burn-related health aspects. The participants reported a low level of negative care experiences, the most common of which was Powerlessness. Most patients were satisfied with care, more with quality of contact with the nursing staff, and less with treatment information. Multiple regressions showed that the BSHS-B Interpersonal relationships subscale was an independent variable related to all measured aspects of patient satisfaction. The highest adjusted R 2 was 0. 25. In a prospective assessment with multiple regression analyses, Age and Education, the personality traits of Stress susceptibility, Trait irritability, Detachment and Social desirability, in addition to the post-traumatic stress symptoms Intrusion and Hyperarousal, were predictors of satisfaction with care. The highest adjusted R 2 was 0. 19. The thesis has pointed out that interpersonal factors are related to care utilisation as well as satisfaction with care.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the role of compatible solutes, extracellular polysaccharides (EPS), and nutrients on anaerobic biomass when stressed with salinity. When 1 mM of osmoregulants glycine betaine, α-glutamate and β-glutamate were added separately to serum bottles containing biomass not adapted to sodium, and fed with glucose and 35 g NaCl/L, all the compatible solutes were found to alleviate sodium inhibition, although glycine betaine {{was found to be}} the most effective. The effect of glycine betaine on different anaerobic bacterial groups under salinity stress was monitored using VFAs, and showed that methanogens were more protected than propionate <b>utilisers.</b> Moreover, the addition of 1 mM of glycine betaine to anaerobic biomass not adapted to salinity resulted in significantly higher methane production rates compared with anaerobic biomass that was exposed for 4 weeks to 35 g NaCl/L. Interestingly, under saline batch conditions when the medium was replaced totally the culture produced less methane than when only new substrate was added due to compatible solutes cycling between the media and the cell. The elimination of macronutrients from the medium was found to have a more pronounced negative effect on biomass under saline compared with nonsaline conditions, and because of the synthesis of N-compatible solutes sufficient nutrients should always be present. On the other hand, the absence from the medium of micronutrients did not further reduce biomass activity under salinity. Finally, a higher production of EPS was obtained from biomass exposed to higher salt concentrations, and its composition was found to change under different saline conditions and time. As a result, biomass under saline conditions had a slightly higher mean flock size compared with the biomass that was not subjected to salt. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Najas flexilis (Willd.) Rostk. & Schmidt is a {{submerged}} annual macrophyte, rare in Europe, {{which is}} protected under the EC Habitats Directive. N. flexilis appears to be decreasing in the British Isles, its main stronghold in Europe. We outline the environmental conditions required for N. flexilis growth, comparing between present and recently extinct sites for the plant. Plant traits (leaf area/shoot length; and reproductive number/shoot length) {{can be used to}} assess N. flexilis population success, and models are produced that can predict this. Both the comparison between present and extinct sites, and the models, suggest that eutrophication and acidification of lakes are the main threats to N. flexilis. Acidification appears to reduce the ability of N. flexilis to produce seeds (potentially fatal for an annual). On the other hand, eutrophication leads to conditions where N. flexilis, an obligate carbon dioxide <b>utiliser,</b> cannot photosynthesise due to the predominance of bicarbonate rather than dissolved carbon dioxide in lake water...|$|E
40|$|M. Sc. Mabula Game Reserve {{initiated}} {{an extensive}} grass-monitoring programme ten years ago. At the same time, management kept records of {{factors such as}} rainfall, burning, game numbers and game composition that might have an influence on grass production. They also conducted an extensive mapping programme {{over a number of}} years to familiarise themselves with the physical phenomena of Mabula, namely geology, soils, slope and aspect, that influence grass growth. The most important aspect of their mapping programme was to divide the reserve into different vegetation communities. The objective of the study is to supply Mabula Game Reserve with clear-cut evidence of the condition of the grazing resources at Mabula. The aim of the study is to assist the management of Mabula with future guidelines in the veld management of the reserve. The overall purpose of this study was to investigate the veld management efficiency of Mabula Game Reserve by establishing whether the ecological status of the grazing had been degraded or improved over the study period. This researcher analysed the grass monitoring data to determine veld condition indices, grazing values, perenniality and to establish the amount of climax and pioneer grass. He sequenced his research by: • classifying grass species in terms of the ecological index method to determine whether grass had been utilised in a sustainable manner or over-utilised;. • calculating the grazing capacity for each vegetation community over the past ten years; • highlighting those grass species in the analyses that showed abnormal growth or decline over the ten years; and • interpreting the results in terms of the ecological status of the relevant area [...] The study was conducted firstly by categorising the grass monitoring stations into different vegetation communities. Ecological indices for each vegetation community was determined. The grass species that showed the biggest increase/decrease in the ten years of monitoring were seperated to determine the ecological significance of the increase/decrease. The ecoloical indices of the different vegetation communities were compared with each other to determine the overall improvement or deterioration of the veld quality. By re-calculating the game numbers for every year, this researcher was able to determine the Game Livestock Unit for the area. With this figure, he was able to differentiate between the grass <b>utilisers,</b> comparing them from year to year in terms of their grazing capacity. The study revealed that in order to obtain an objective view of the condition of the veld, it is necessary to evaluate the condition of the veld in terms of each vegetation community, as well as the total area. Such an approach would enable the manager to plan according to a specific vegetation community. The study also made it clear that it is necessary to reduce the number of game, but that this must be done by culling the appropriate group of <b>utilisers.</b> The necessity of introducing a browsing monitoring programme soon became evident. The study showed how the grass and game monitoring analyses for the area can be applied in association with the rainfall figures in forward planning in order to manage the sustainable utilisation of biological resources and to minimise the effects of drought conditions. The researcher concluded this study by highlighting the shortfalls of the ecological index method in determining the condition of the veld, and recommended other methods i. e. the Benchmark Method, Key Species Method, and the Weighted Key Species Method to supplement the present method. Another recommendation was to collect two different sets of data during monitoring to avoid conflicting results, as was the case with the 2004 survey. One data set should include herbs and forbs while the other set should only contain grass species...|$|R
40|$|Context: Primates {{are one of}} {{the most}} charismatic and widely studied {{vertebrate}} groups. However, the study of new world primates in green patches within urban areas has been neglected. Such primates have been viewed as a source of human–animal conflict; however, their ecological importance to urban ecosystems and their role in human well being is poorly understood. Aims: To increase understanding of both ecological and socioeconomical factors affecting the distribution, density and group sizes of urban marmosets in a large Brazilian city (Belo Horizonte). Methods: A map of vegetation cover and land use was produced and employed to investigate the distribution of marmosets. An online questionnaire was extensively publicised, which permitted the public to report the occurrence or not of marmosets near their residences. For sites with low salary levels and low internet availability, face-to-face interviews were conducted. Additionally, field surveys were conducted in 120 green areas identified by spatial analysis as potential areas of occurrence. The human population density, salary levels and green areas were posteriorly correlated with marmoset distribution. Key results: Despite the urbanisation and high human population density, green fragments within the city still housed marmoset groups. However, the presence of green areas did not always indicate primate presence. Group presence was significantly related to the size of parks or green areas and negatively related to built-up areas, and human density. Salary levels were related to more forested streets and possibly tolerance. Marmosets were classified as urban <b>utilisers.</b> Conclusions: The human–wildlife conflict with marmoset species was relatively low, owing to marmoset avoidance of built-up areas. The interaction of marmoset species and city dwellers was mainly limited to borders of forest fragments and inside city parks, and appeared to be human motivated. Implications: This study showed the importance of public involvement in wildlife studies in urban environments; clarifying the interaction between city dwellers and wild species is essential to mitigate negative interactions...|$|R
40|$|Ruminant {{livestock}} {{contribute significantly}} to global greenhouse gas emissions. This is due to microorganisms, known as methanogens that generate methane from hydrogen and carbon dioxide during feed fermentation in the rumen. Mitigation strategies are being developed to reduce methane emissions from ruminants. However, inhibiting methane production may cause accumulation of unused hydrogen in the rumen, which may slow down rumen fermentation and affect animal productivity. Homoacetogens, microbes known to reside in the rumen, can use hydrogen and carbon dioxide to form acetate. Homoacetogens could take {{over the role of}} ruminal hydrogen disposal following inhibition of methanogens. The aims of this study were to quantify the involvement of alternative hydrogen <b>utilisers,</b> such as homoacetogens, in hydrogen or electron utilisation. Chemical compounds were screened to identify specific inhibitors of methanogens (BES, acetylene), and both methanogens and homoacetogens (chloroform). Homoacetogenesis was measured via incorporation of 13 CO 2 into 13 C-acetate using a short-term in vitro assay. This short-term in vitro assay measured and confirmed the occurrence of homoacetogenesis in sheep rumen fluid, and it accounted for 1. 67 % of electron utilisation in fresh rumen fluid. Homoacetogenesis increased in the assay when BES was added, suggesting homoacetogens could increase their activity in the absence of methanogens. Homoacetogenesis decreased with the addition of chloroform, which is known to partially inhibit homoacetogens. Methane formation was inhibited by acetylene in an in vitro serial batch fermentation inoculated with sheep rumen fluid. Homoacetogenesis did not increase, but the homoacetogens were able to grow and maintain themselves as the rumen material was repeatedly diluted and supplemented with fresh feed. Their activity accounted for 2. 32 % of electron utilisation. To study their significance in the rumen, methane formation was inhibited in sheep using acetylene. Homoacetogenesis increased and accounted for 6. 53 % of electron utilisation. However, propionate appeared to be the major electron sink (58 - 88 %) in the absence of methanogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. In the future, knowledge of these hydrogen-utilising microorganisms could be used to divert hydrogen or electrons into more beneficial end-products, leading to the transition from a normal methane-producing rumen to an equally or even more productive low methane one...|$|R
