40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a new sampling method for motion planning that can generate configurations more <b>uniformly</b> <b>distributed</b> on C-obstacle surfaces than prior approaches. Here, roadmap nodes are {{generated from the}} intersections between C-obstacles {{and a set of}} <b>uniformly</b> <b>distributed</b> fixed-length segments in C-space. The results show that this new sampling method yields samples that are more <b>uniformly</b> <b>distributed</b> than previous obstacle-based methods such as OBPRM, Gaussian sampling, and Bridge test sampling. UOBPRM is shown to have nodes more <b>uniformly</b> <b>distributed</b> near C-obstacle surfaces and also requires the fewest nodes and edges to solve challenging motion planning problems with varying narrow passages.
