The polarized light near the <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>spectrum</b> {{appears to be}} particularly important. Many migratory butterflies live in semi-arid areas where breeding seasons are short.

5|$|Bioluminescent {{organisms are}} {{a target for}} many areas of research. Luciferase systems are widely used in genetic {{engineering}} as reporter genes, each producing a different colour by fluorescence, and for biomedical research using bioluminescence imaging. For example, the firefly luciferase gene was used as early as 1986 for research using transgenic tobacco plants. Vibrio bacteria symbiose with marine invertebrates such as the Hawaiian bobtail squid (Euprymna scolopes), are key experimental models for bioluminescence. Bioluminescent activated destruction is an experimental cancer treatment.

25|$|Some {{animals can}} {{distinguish}} {{colors in the}} <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>spectrum.</b> The UV spectrum falls outside the human visible range, except for some cataract surgery patients.

25|$|Gapes of {{juvenile}} altricial birds are often brightly coloured, sometimes with contrasting spots or other patterns, {{and these are}} believed to be an indication of their health, fitness and competitive ability. Based on this, the parents decide how to distribute food among the chicks in the nest. Some species, especially in the families Viduidae and Estrildidae, have bright spots on the gape known as gape tubercles or gape papillae. These nodular spots are conspicuous even in low light. A study examining the nestling gapes of eight passerine species found that the gapes were conspicuous in the <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>spectrum</b> (visible to birds but not to humans). Parents may, however, not rely solely on the gape coloration, and other factors influencing their decision remain unknown.|$|E
25|$|Cockatoo {{species have}} a mobile crest of {{feathers}} {{on the top}} of their heads, which they can raise for display, and retract. No other parrots can do so, but the Pacific lorikeets in the genera Vini and Phigys can ruffle the feathers of the crown and nape, and the red-fan parrot (or hawk-headed parrot) has a prominent feather neck frill that it can raise and lower at will. The predominant colour of plumage in parrots is green, though most species have some red or another colour in small quantities. Cockatoos are the main exception to this, having lost the green and blue plumage colours in their evolutionary history; they are now predominately black or white with some red, pink, or yellow. Strong sexual dimorphism in plumage is not typical among parrots, with some notable exceptions, the most striking being the eclectus parrot. However {{it has been shown that}} some parrot species exhibit sexually dimorphic plumage in the <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>spectrum,</b> normally invisible to humans.|$|E

OAO-1's battery failed after three days, terminating the mission. It was followed by OAO-2, which carried out ultraviolet observations of stars and galaxies from its launch in 1968 until 1972, well beyond its original planned lifetime of one year.|$|E
500|$|Butterflies {{use their}} {{antennae}} {{to sense the}} air for wind and scents. The antennae come in various shapes and colours; the hesperiids have a pointed angle or hook to the antennae, while most other families show knobbed antennae. The antennae are richly covered with sensory organs known as sensillae. A butterfly's sense of taste is coordinated by chemoreceptors on the tarsi, or feet, which work only on contact, and are used to determine whether an egg-laying insect's offspring {{will be able to}} feed on a leaf before eggs are laid on it. Many butterflies use chemical signals, pheromones; some have specialized scent scales (androconia) or other structures (coremata or [...] "hair pencils" [...] in the Danaidae). Vision is well developed in butterflies and most species are sensitive to the <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>spectrum.</b> Many species show sexual dimorphism in the patterns of UV reflective patches. Colour vision may be widespread but has been demonstrated in only a few species. Some butterflies have organs of hearing and some species make stridulatory and clicking sounds.|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the application of}} ultraviolet spectroscopy for the rapid determination of aesculin, aesculetin and fraxetin in Cortex fraxini extract solutions, <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>spectra</b> of Cortex fraxini extract solutions from different batches were collected in the spectral range from 200 nm to 400 nm.

Thus, K-OPLS was proposed to establish the calibration models for the determination of Cortex fraxini extract solutions between the reference data and <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>spectra.</b> The calibration results were achieved for the determination of Cortex fraxini extract solutions. The coefficients of determination in calibration (R 2) for aesculin, aesculetin and fraxetin were 0. 989, 0. 957 and 0. 939, while in prediction (R 2) were 0. 982, 0. 979 and 0. 962, respectively. And the root-mean-square error of prediction (RMSEP) for aesculin, aesculet and fraxetin were 11. 99, 3. 02 and 1. 59 μg/mL.

2500|$|The {{brightest}} {{star in the}} constellation, Gamma Velorum, is a complex multiple star system. The brighter component, known as Gamma2 Velorum or Suhail, shines as a blue-white star of apparent magnitude 1.83. It is a spectroscopic binary made up of two very hot blue stars orbiting each other every 78.5 days and separated by somewhere between 0.8 and 1.6 Astronomical Units (AU). The brighter component is a hot blue main-sequence star of spectral type O7.5 and is around 280,000 times as luminous, [...] is around 30 times as massive and is 17 times the diameter of our Sun with a surface temperature of 35,000 K. The second component is an extremely rare example of hot star known as a Wolf–Rayet star, and is the brightest example in the sky. It has a surface temperature of 57,000 and is around 170,000 times as luminous as our sun, though it radiates most of its energy in the <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>spectrum.</b> [...] Gamma1 is a blue-white star of spectral type B2III and apparent magnitude 4.3. [...] The two pairs are separated by 41 arcseconds, easily separable in binoculars. [...] Parallax measurements give a distance of 1,116 light-years, meaning that they are at least 12,000 AU apart.

2500|$|Using {{this model}} the {{effective}} temperature of stars is estimated, {{defined as the}} temperature of a black body that yields the same surface flux of energy as the star. If a star were a black body, the same effective temperature would result from any region of the spectrum. For example, comparisons in the B (blue) or V (visible) range lead to the so-called B-V color index, which increases the redder the star, with the Sun having an index of +0.648 ± 0.006. Combining the U (ultraviolet) and the B indices leads to the U-B index, which becomes more negative the hotter the star and the more the UV radiation. Assuming the Sun is a type G2 V star, its U-B index is +0.12. The two indices for two types of stars are compared in the figure with the effective surface temperature of the stars assuming they are black bodies. It {{can be seen that}} there is only a rough correlation. For example, for a given B-V index from the blue-visible region of the spectrum., the curves for both types of star lie below the corresponding black-body U-B index that includes the <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>spectrum,</b> showing that both types of star emit less ultraviolet light than a black body with the same B-V index. It is perhaps surprising that they fit a black body curve as well as they do, considering that stars have greatly different temperatures at different depths. For example, the Sun has an effective temperature of 5780 K, which can be compared to the temperature of the photosphere of the Sun (the region generating the light), which ranges from about 5000 K at its outer boundary with the chromosphere to about 9500 K at its inner boundary with the convection zone approximately [...] deep.|$|E
