25|$|Yamamoto {{committed}} Combined Fleet {{units to}} a series of small attrition actions across the south and central Pacific that stung the Americans, but suffered losses he could ill afford in return. Three major efforts to carry the island precipitated a pair of carrier battles that Yamamoto commanded personally at the Eastern Solomons and Santa Cruz Islands in September and October, and finally a wild pair of surface engagements in November, all timed to coincide with Japanese Army pushes. The timing of each major battle was successively derailed when the army could not hold up its end of the operation. Yamamoto's naval forces won a few victories and inflicted considerable losses and damage to the US fleet in several naval battles around Guadalcanal which included the battles of Savo Island, Cape Esperance, and Tassafaronga, but he could never draw the <b>US</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> decisive fleet action. As a result, Japanese naval strength began to diminish.|$|E

500|$|Thomas Sotinel of Le Monde {{started his}} review by recalling the {{irritation}} the film caused upon its world premiere in Cannes, and compared the cut {{he had seen}} there to the final version: [...] "In all honesty, the difference does not jump to my eyes. Of course, the film seems more consistent, {{but that may be}} because we've already traveled this maze once. While leaving, we might remain calmer, but still amazed by the mixture of exuberant invention and puerility." [...] A positive review came from L'Express, written by Laurent Djian, who compared the film to 2001: A Space Odyssey. He applauded how he found the strobe lights hypnotising in a way that influenced the perception of time. [...] "In 2010, no other filmmaker [...] than Gaspar Noé can shoot with such mastery, nor draw <b>us</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> vortex of sensations as vertiginous." [...] Ouest-Frances critic, on the other hand, was immensely bored by the film, and called it [...] "a padding of simple ideas, stereotypes and cliches in a heap of contrived and vain images which think they're technical prowess.

The result isn't quite as fresh and inventive as some of Guetta's recent output – Kelis' [...] 'Acapella', for example – but it goes a long way towards recapturing some of last summer's magic." [...] The site's other reviewer, Nick Levine, agreed saying that the song [...] "thumps as persuasively as Muhammad Ali circa 1967." [...] Robert Daw of Idolator said [...] "if you think Ms. Kelly is taking the go-go boots off anytime soon, then you'd best go lean against the wall, flower. Rowland's Guetta-produced new single 'Commander' is pure strobe-light adrenaline rush... will appear on Kelly's as-yet-untitled third solo album... we're predicting a full on Rowland Renaissance!".

Hoberman of The Village Voice {{said the}} film was a [...] "gripping" [...] account that did [...] "an {{excellent}} job in deconstructing the Venezuelan TV news footage of blood, chaos, and rival crowds", {{and said it was}} [...] "nearly a textbook on media manipulation". Writing for The New York Times, Stephen Holden said {{the film was}} [...] "a riveting documentary" [...] that delivered [...] "the suspense of a smaller-scale Seven Days in May", citing {{the way in which it}} examined how television can be used to [...] "deceive and manipulate the public". He reproached the film's uncritical depiction of Chávez, and how it hinted at CIA involvement without presenting any proof. Ty Burr in The Boston Globe called the film [...] "our best chance" [...] to find out what really happened on 11–13April, but cautioned that the filmmakers' [...] "pro-Chávez stance" [...] meant that for wider context audiences should look elsewhere, as it left out too much of Chávez's record. Burr also said the film's attempt to make the <b>US</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> villain was ineffective. He said, [...] "because [...] view the chasm that divides Venezuela purely in the context of the Cold War and Latin American political instability, they downplay the class warfare that's exploding right in front of them."

Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times enjoyed the [...] "fun" [...] {{scenes in the}} parallel universe, and stated he would not mind watching an entire show about their Fringe Division. IGN's Ramsey Isler called the victims' method of death in [...] "Immortality" [...] "one of the nastiest in recent memory," [...] and rated the episode 8.5/10.

500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. The A.V.

VanDerWerff compared elements of the episode, most notably the relationship between the character of Henry Dion and his mother, to the works of filmmaker David Lynch, particularly his television series Twin Peaks. Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 4.5 out of 5, noting that it [...] "caps off the series sensationally". Gibron also praised Starr's guest role, describing it as [...] "a stellar interpretation". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated [...] "Paper Dove" [...] four stars out of five. Shearman felt that the series found a comfortable [...] "tonal nuance" [...] in the episode that worked for it, but felt {{that by the end of}} the first season none of the supporting cast had been developed well enough to play against Henriksen's Frank Black, noting [...] "there are half a dozen actors who could be termed regulars ... but without exception they remain functional ciphers".|$|E

500|$|In the Battle of Long Island on August 27, 1776, British forces {{successfully}} occupied western Long Island (modern Brooklyn), compelling Washington {{to withdraw}} his army to Manhattan. [...] General Howe then paused to consolidate his gains, and the brothers {{decided to make}} a diplomatic overture. [...] During the battle they had captured several high-ranking Continental Army officers, including Major General John Sullivan. [...] The Howes managed to convince Sullivan that a conference with members of the Continental Congress might yield fruit, and released him on parole to deliver a message to the Congress in Philadelphia, proposing an informal meeting to discuss ending the armed conflict between Britain and its rebellious colonies. [...] After Sullivan's speech to Congress, John Adams cynically commented on this diplomatic attempt, calling Sullivan a [...] "decoy-duck" [...] and accusing the British of sending Sullivan [...] "to seduce <b>us</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> renunciation of our independence"; others noted that it appeared to be an attempt to blame Congress for prolonging the war.

In his essay, [...] "War Guilt in the Middle East," [...] Rothbard states that Israel refused [...] "to let these refugees return and reclaim the property taken from them." [...] He took negative views of the two state solution for the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, saying: On the one hand there are the Palestinian Arabs, who have tilled the soil or otherwise used the land of Palestine for centuries; and on the other, there are a group of external fanatics, who {{come from all over}} the world, and who claim the entire land area as [...] "given" [...] to them as a collective religion or tribe at some remote or legendary time in the past. There is no way the two claims can be resolved to the satisfaction of both parties.

500|$|A {{significant}} [...] in {{the development}} of hip-hop was the addition of eight-counts, a method of counting dance steps to stay in sync with the music. Toni Basil introduced this studio technique into locking in the 1970s. Basil was trained in ballet before being introduced to street dance by Don Campbell, the creator of locking and founding member of The Lockers dance crew. She is responsible for teaching the rest of The Lockers how to dance to counts. In an interview with NPR, Lockers member Adolfo [...] "Shabba-Doo" [...] Quiñones stated [...] "I would say that Toni Basil was sort of our Abe Saperstein in terms of how she was able to organize <b>us</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> professional dance troupe. I remember her teaching us how to count music. She was like, okay, we were like, count music? How do you count soul? It was crazy, you know?... all of our cues kind of went something like this, boom, pop, do boom, pada da boom, pada like that. And she was like, how do you guys get in sync like that? I said it's a feeling, you know?" [...] Traditionally hip-hop dance, or any form of street dance, is not performed to counts as these styles were created on the street rather than in a studio setting. So the introduction of counts was a pivotal move into bringing hip-hop dance from the street into the studio. Even with this addition, it would be years before commercial hip-hop developed into its current form.|$|E
