The {{application of these}} systems as a backbone of decision support systems allows for effective and efficient information management. To sufficiently evaluate such kind of integrated systems recognising events {{for the benefit of}} decision makers, a holistic methodology is necessary. We propose a new methodology which complements existing approaches for technology-oriented verification and validation by user-oriented evaluation (<b>user</b> <b>experience</b> <b>analysis).</b> We illustrate the proposed methodology by evaluating EP-IRM, an event processing system for intelligent resource management. This case study shows that our methodology offers invaluable information about the performance and acceptance of an eventbased decision support system.

Websites are an important communication medium in today 2 ̆ 7 s society and theory is needed to better understand the experience of using them. This dissertation addressed the website user experience in the context of public relations and proposed a framework of the public relations website experience built on the major coordinates of time and space. The framework provides a description of three phases of the temporal dimension (first impression, exploration, and exit) and of the components of the spatial dimension (modules, elements, and element functions). Research questions exploring the connections between the temporal and the spatial dimensions were advanced. Empirical research was conducted following a new research protocol called <b>User</b> <b>Experience</b> <b>Analysis.</b> Based on the data analysis, the temporal and spatial dimensions were connected and the public relations website experience of the student community who participated in this research was mapped. ...|$|E

As {{one of the most}} important and informative expressions, smile conveys the underlying emotion status such as joy, happiness, and satisfaction. In this paper, an efficient smile detection approach is proposed based on Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The faces are first detected and a holistic flow-based face registration is applied which does not need any manual labeling or key point detection. Then ELM is used to train the classifier. The proposed smile detector is tested with different feature descriptors on publicly available databases including real-world face images. The comparisons against benchmark classifiers including Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) suggest that the proposed ELM based smile detector in general performs better and is very efficient. Compared to state-of-the-art smile detector, the proposed method achieves competitive results without preprocessing and manual registration. & 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. 1...|$|E

There are a number of different tools and techniques currently available to plan, design, and manage projects. In most cases, project managers must use a number of different software packages to complete a successful project. With the advent of application programming interfaces (API) and open-source software, proper cost effective tools can be at the disposal of project managers and staff. An open-source alternative exists on all levels of web GIS infrastructure. Project risk and waste can be limited with the ability to effectively plan and control projects, thereby increasing the probability of success. The website created in this case study provides users the ability to view the progress of a project- according to user needs. Its dashboard-style interface aids in visualizing and disseminating project information.

Being less engaged with how our food is prepared contributes to unhealthy eating habits. This lifestyle also leaves us with less time for sharing quality face-to-face communication with our friends and loved ones. Less quality time together leads to poorer quality relationships. In our fast evolving, highly technological world, we don't spend quality time cooking or eating together because our attention is split. Due to the wonders of modern technology, we have lost the habit of working only regular business hours. We are constantly bombarded by other demands on our time. How can we bring people back to the dinner table together, giving each other their undivided attention? How can we {{find a way to}} bring fun back into the kitchen, engaging people with cooking?

It is a simple application that subtracts outcome from income and shows the current financial state. The work begins with a detailed analysis of the best possible user interface options that give the most comfortable user experience. This is followed by the implementation in a Delphi environment. The results show that even a simple application like Bilanca takes a lot of coding to produce a flawless user interface. The author points out that users would normally use Microsoft Excel when trying to solve a problem like the one solved by Bilanca. As he analyses the Excel's user interface and results from the literature, some possible improvements are found and used in the practical implementation. The resulting application is focused on solving only the specific user problem, namely the management of personal financial flows, and gives a better user experience than Excel. The diploma work contains a research of literature on user interfaces, definition of a typical user of Bilanca, prototype development, <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> <b>analysis</b> with Excel, new ideas for improving the user interface, and finally the development of Bilanca in a Delphi environment together with a description of difficulties that were found.

It is not surprising that emotions have been a point of interest for researchers for centuries (Sousa, 2010), however, even after considerable research effort over many years, there is no definitive answer to the question „What is an emotion?‟ (Scherer, 2005). As computer programs and application become more complex <b>User</b> <b>experience</b> and the ability to interact successfully has become crucial, and as such the Human Computer Interaction (HCI) becomes critical to that success. One increasingly important aspect of HCI is the role played by the user‟s emotional state on such interactions. But as emotions are difficult at best to define, the goal is to identify a method by which they can be analysed and predicted thus enabling a possible improvement to interface interactions, and <b>user</b> <b>experience.</b> Biometric <b>analysis</b> offers one solution to this complex situation. Although there are many techniques utilized in biometric analysis it is imperative that whichever method is employed has the minimum effect without causing distress or interruption to the user‟s interaction.

40|$|This seminar was {{delivered}} on 25 th January 2011 by Wen-Chia Wang, a PhD researcher in the School of Engineering and Design at Brunel University. During her PhD, Wen-Chia worked on several projects with the telecommunication company 3 in the UK to understand <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> with mobile phones. Her PhD research addresses {{the importance of}} understanding users before conducting design; especially how individual differences of cognitive styles (holistic - serialistic) affect human operational behaviour with mobile phone interfaces. More importantly, her research seeks to establish the linkage between psychology and design, and to provide design guidelines {{that are based on}} individual differences. The presentation was hosted at Brunel University as part of the Human Centred Design Institute (HCDI) Research Seminar Series. HCDI is a University Research Centre (URC) that brings together expertise in Human-centred Design which combines methodologies and technologies from design, engineering, computer science, artificial intelligence and philosophy. Human-centred Design leads to machines, systems and products which are physically, cognitively and emotionally intuitive to their users. The Human Centre Design seminar series are events designed to encourage communication and teamwork with colleagues across the university and experts leaders in human-centred related topics. The aim {{of this study is to}} understand <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> of touch screen mobile phones and to provide design principles from users’ perspectives. The importance of <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> in the product design process has been discussed in recent decades. Diverse quantitative methodologies attempt to understand users by evaluating their attitudes, expectations, emotion, concept of the object, judgment of the product and so forth. However, <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> is subjective and difficult to measure. Whilst many researchers tend to transform <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> to quantitative data, Coxon’s (2007) Taxonomy of Experience (ToE), and its analytic approach of SEEing, uncover an understanding of the <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> through qualitative <b>analysis.</b> The term ‘SEEing’ attempts to differentiate from the processes of thinking, but still associates with the thinking process. The nine steps of the SEEing process aim to clarify the <b>user’s</b> <b>experience.</b> It begins by transforming the user’s verbal commentary and ends in a synthesis of super-ordinary metaphors. This study thus applies ToE-SEEing to deeply understand mobile phone users, especially their interaction experience with touch screen mobile phones.

The 21 st-century editor, in an accentuated role as innovative creative producer (combining creativity with entrepreneurial skills), can now wield a wider range of tools, inspired by the approaches used in the creative-tech sector for new product development such as <b>user</b> <b>experience,</b> data <b>analysis,</b> iterative testing as well as a range of digital creative content tools. This paper will consider how a radical rethink of this role could help both academic and trade publishing rediscover its central position within our culture and clarify the added value it offers to authors and readers...|$|R
