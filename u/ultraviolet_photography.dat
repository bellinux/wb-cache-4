40|$|The {{study of}} rock art has {{traditionally}} {{focused on the}} analyses of style and technique rather than of materials and technology, {{in part because it}} is often considered undesirable to remove pigment samples for laboratory analysis.

As such, only a limited amount of data have been generated in the last twenty years that deal with the technology involved in the manufacture of rock art. However, recent advances in photography-based procedures involving digital image enhancement (Clogg et al. 2000) and multispectral imaging (Kamal et al. 1999) have successfully highlighted the possibilities of using non-conventional photographic techniques as in situ methods of analysis, and are currently supplying new information about aboriginal pigment and stone working technologies to the field of rock art studies.

5000|$|As long as {{photographic}} {{materials were}} usefully sensitive only to blue-green, blue, violet and <b>ultraviolet,</b> three-color <b>photography</b> {{could never be}} practical. In 1873 German chemist Hermann Wilhelm Vogel discovered that the addition of small amounts of certain aniline dyes to a photographic emulsion could add sensitivity to colors which the dyes absorbed. He identified dyes which variously sensitized for all the previously ineffective colors except true red, to which only a marginal trace of sensitivity could be added. In the following year, Edmond Becquerel discovered that chlorophyll was a good sensitizer for red. Although it would be many more years before these sensitizers (and better ones developed later) found much use beyond scientific applications such as spectrography, they were quickly and eagerly adopted by Louis Ducos du Hauron, Charles Cros and other color photography pioneers. Exposure times for the [...] "problem" [...] colors could now be reduced from hours to minutes. As ever-more-sensitive gelatin emulsions replaced the old wet and dry collodion processes, the minutes became seconds.

According to our analytical studies, red, green, blue, black, and gold-like metallic paints were identified to be a red monoazo pigment (b-naphthol PR 53 : 1), chrome green, artificial ultramarine blue, carbon black, and brass powder (Dutch metal powder), respectively, dating the playing card to 1895 onward based on the manufacturing date of the red monoazo pigment. Barite was also shown to be mixed with the pigments as an extender. On the other hand, the portrait’s face of the playing card was peculiarly blackened. Our analytical approach toward characterizing the blackened face showed that the black paint was achieved by carbon black and, in other words, the face was not blackened due to the darkening of Pb-bearing pigments.

40|$|This {{research}} is divided in two sections: The first one focuses on original historic documents, namely the copy letters of Heinrich Schliemann. Schliemann, a tradesman, who traveled frequently, {{but he was}} also involved in archaeological excavations in several different sites. Therefore, he maintained a thorough correspondence, but also kept a record of it by means of a copy press. Schliemann's outgoing mail extends to 43 volumes and, after careful examination of the entire archive, a selection of pages was studied and documented using nondestructive and hyperspectral imaging methods in the visible, ultraviolet and infrared region of the spectrum. This led to the classification of inks into groups of similar characteristics that can be linked to several factors, among others the inks' recipes. <b>Ultraviolet</b> Reflectance <b>Photography</b> helped in the distinction of the oxidation limits around ink characters. Infrared Reflectography distinguished between oxidation and diffusion of the ink's halo. Visible reflectograms helped to better distinguish the borders of inks. <b>Ultraviolet</b> Fluorescence Colour <b>Photography</b> detected the ink's oxidation halo clearly and more intense than Ultraviot t Fluorescence black and white Photography. False Colour lnfrared imaging differentiated inks based on their false colour in the infrared. In general, the combination of these methods can lead to differentiation of inks compared to each other into groups with similar optical behaviour. The documentation recorded the state of preservation of the document in a specific and given time. The images act as evidence of the actual existence of such an archive and as reference to future comparisons to verify if and when a change has occurred in the state of preservation of the copy letters. As access may be an issue for researchers in faraway lands, the documentation gave direct contact with the images of the archive. It revealed the different inks used during a 50 year timeline, adding helpful information in each era's preferences and availability of writing media. The second section is based on laboratory prepared samples. I n order to understand the copy letters, one has to go through the whole procedure of reproducing them. lron gall ink and copy ink recipes were sourced and used to manufacture inks. The inks were used to write on papers similar to the ones used in the end of the 19 th century, and the copy press procedure was applied in order to produce copies. Non-destructive imaging and documentation was applied to the laboratory copies. The resulting images were compared with those of the originals and were able to locate, verify and resolve to the typical characteristics of inks on copies. This is of great importance to historians that come across documents and classfy them, but also to conservators, who need to know if it is a written or copied document in order lo chose the appropriate conservation treatment. The written and copied samples as well as the inks themselves were also analysed using chemical methods of analysis in order to study and to group inks with similar characteristics or differentiate them from each other. The analyses also proved that copied inks retain the characteristics of the original writing, thus making a comparison of copied and non-copied inks directly possible and also making feasible tracing inks back to their original recipe based on their morphology. Scanning Electron Microsopy at high magnifications proved that no matter what was the paper substrate, the morphology of the ink's surface remained the same even when it underwent the copy press procedure or had been transferred onto another paper. Also that inks from different recipes exhibit morphological characteristics that distinguished them in such an extent that can be classified as different. Fiber Optic Reflectance Spectroscsopy revealed that distinction of a copy from a written document is possible and that differentiation of inks can be achieved. Colour measurement of the tristimulous values of each ink led to their classification into groups. Inductively Coupled Plasma spectroscopy revealed much information regarding the ingredients of the paper substrate as well as the ink itself. Raman Microspectroscopy succeeded in proving that the analysed inks were iron gall inks, independently of the paper substrate or the state the ink e. g. before and after the copy press procedure or copy. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy was performed on be samples depending on their physical phase liquid, solid and ink on paper and showed they can be identified as metal-gall inks. Two of the eight inks can be distinguished from the others. Using Attenuated Total Reflectance mode on inks on paper can indicate differentiation in the recipes. The paper substrate did not interfere in reading the spectra. Differentiation into separate categories could only be achieved by comparison of inks with each other. For a conservator {{it is very important to}} be able to classify materials found on objects as it helps in selecting the conservation treatment. Furthermore, inks can be grouped or differentiated due to specific characteristics; this will help historians, archivists and researchers in distinguishing the main text of a document from various additions and if so, also classify the additions based on the type of recipe, in different origins or eras...|$|R
40|$|The {{crucifix}} from Årdal in Ryfylke is {{the only}} large medieval crucifix still in the county of Rogaland. It was presented to Stavanger Museum in 1908 and is looked upon as the museum’s greatest treasure. Its poor state of conservation, disfiguring overpaintings and poorly executed secondary additions resulted in it being removed from the sacred art exhibition and put into storage. It {{was found to be}} suitable for the practical part of Anne Ytterdal’s examination in technical conservation. The work was carried out at the Museum of Archaeology in Stavanger between January 1988 and June 1989. The crucifix underwent thorough examination using X-ray photography, computerized tomography (CT) and <b>ultraviolet</b> and infrared <b>photography.</b> Art historians have disagreed on the exact dating of the crucifix within the 13 th century. This was clarified by the use of CT, which dated the crucifix to before 1250. The materials constituting the crucifix and the techniques used to make it were examined and identified by ordinary binocular microscopy, wood analysis, wet chemical analysis and analysis of cross sections in an electron microscope. The results showed that the layers of paint and the gilding had been applied using the techniques commonly practiced in Norwegian medieval painting whereby few pigments were mixed and used to build up simple structures on strictly limited areas. The only uncommon usage of materials on the crucifix was the use of red lead as a pigment to imitate jewellery and the absence of underpainting for the red lead inside the crown. The ground and paint layers on the crucifix were conserved with sturgeon glue. When the restoration method was being decided, emphasis was placed on the prominent position which the crucifix would occupy in the museum in the future. It was decided to remove the overpainting of the loincloth because of the poor effect it had on the figure as a whole and the way it distorted the true experience of medieval splendour. The original paint was intact {{on the face of the}} crucifix. The rest of the figure was treated in such a way that its surface retained the impression of age. The damage on the figure was retouched in a manner that allowed it to remain as distinct as possible and at the same time unobtrusive compared to the rest of the figure. The medieval colours on the crucifix were kept as true as possible...|$|R
40|$|Footwear {{impression}} {{evidence in}} dust {{is often difficult}} to locate in ambient light and is a fragile medium that both collection and enhancement techniques can destroy or distort. The collection of footwear impression evidence always begins with non-destructive photographic techniques; however, current methods are limited to oblique lighting of the impression followed by an attempt to photograph in situ 12, 15, 17. For the vast majority of footwear impressions, an interactive collection method, and thus a potentially destructive procedure, is subsequently carried out to gather the evidence 18. Therefore, alternative non-destructive means for the preservation and enhancement of footwear impressions in dust merits further attention. Previous research performed with reflected <b>ultraviolet</b> (UV) <b>photography</b> and reflected <b>ultraviolet</b> imaging systems (RUVIS) has shown that there are additional non-destructive methodologies that {{can be applied to the}} search for and documentation of footwear impressions in dust 34, 36, 37. Unfortunately, these prior studies did not include robust comparisons to traditional oblique white light, instead choosing to focus on different UV wavelengths. This study, however, seeks to evaluate the use of a RUVIS device paired with a 254 nanometer (nm) UV light source to locate 2 -D footwear impressions in dust on multiple substrates against standard oblique white light techniques and assess the visibility of the impression and amount of background interference present. The optimal angle of incident UV light for each substrate was also investigated. Finally, this study applied an image enhancement technique in order to evaluate its usefulness when looking at the visibility of a footwear impression and the amount of background interference present for enhanced white light and RUVIS pictures of footwear impressions in dust. 	A collection of eight different substrate types was gathered for investigation, including vinyl composition tile (VCT), ceramic tile, marble tile, magazine paper, steel sheet metal, vinyl flooring, wood flooring, and carpet. Heel impressions were applied to the various substrates utilizing vacuum collected dust and normal walking pressure. Each substrate was then explored and photographed in ambient fluorescent light, oblique white light at 0, 15, 30, and 0 with the light source below the surface plane of the substrate, and 254 nm UV light at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 and 0 with the light source below the surface plane of the substrate. All pictures were evaluated for clarity and visible detail of the footwear impression and the amount of background interference present, selecting for the best images within a lighting condition group. Additional intra- and intergroup comparisons were carried out to explore differences created by the various lighting conditions. Enhanced images were then created with the best scored pictures and evaluated for additional modifications in impression visibility and background interference. 	Photographs of footwear impressions in dust illuminated with ambient fluorescent light proved to be the most difficult conditions under which a footwear impression could be visualized. However, both oblique white light and 254 nm UV light lighting conditions showed improvements in either visualization or background dropout, or both, over ambient light conditions. An assessment of the white light and 254 nm UV light RUVIS images also demonstrated that the best angles for the light source for all substrates were oblique 0 and oblique 0 below the surface plane of the substrate lighting. It was found that white light photographs generally provided higher visibility ratings, while RUVIS 254 nm UV light photographs provided better grades for reducing background interference. Enhanced images of white light conditions provided generally poorer quality and quantity of details, while enhanced RUVIS images seemed to improve upon these areas. 	 The use of a RUVIS to capture photographs of footwear impression evidence in dust was found to be a successful secondary non-destructive technique that can be paired with traditional oblique white light procedures. Additionally, the use of below the surface plane of the substrate lighting techniques were found to improve either visibility or background dropout, or both, over standard 0 oblique lighting, depending on the light source, and should be employed, when applicable. Finally, further investigation into digital photo-editing enhancement techniques for footwear impression evidence in dust is needed...|$|R
