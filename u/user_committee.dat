40|$|Water is a {{critical}} natural resource not only to life and natural ecosystem functioning, but also, for economic and social development. The global recognition {{of the role of}} water in development dates back in 1977 with the United Nations Water Conference in Mar del Plata. Since then, water has remained pivotal in the development of nations. Specifically, groundwater is critical to sustainable development, meeting the global water needs of over 1. 5 million people daily. However, it is rarely well managed. This study therefore examined community water management, and analysed the participation of water <b>user</b> <b>committees</b> in public groundwater infrastructure management in relation to functional sustainability in Namayingo Town Council. Community water management was adopted to involve communities in groundwater development and management, and enhance the sustainability of rural water systems in Uganda. Yet, non-functionality of water sources upsurges, and the Ministry of Water and Environment continues to offer technical solutions. However, it is important to analyse the social and community factors, maintenance, and water sector policy and institutional frameworks that impact on the participation of water <b>user</b> <b>committees</b> and functional sustainability. For empirical evidence, empirical investigation was based on a case study design taking a qualitative approach. Findings revealed that community water management remains rhetoric in Namayingo Town Council. In policy documents, the model promises sustainability. However, non-functionality of water facilities reveals the inability of the model to address sustainability. There was lack of participation of water <b>user</b> <b>committees</b> in the initial stages of groundwater infrastructure development. Further, the practice of the national water sector policies at community level exacerbated by inadequate institutional support did not support the institutional and economic structures of water <b>user</b> <b>committees.</b> Hence, participation and inadequate social capital were key in understanding the lack of functionality sustainability of groundwater facilities in Namayingo Town Council, Ugand...|$|R
40|$|Human-wildlife {{conflict}} {{is one of}} the biggest conservation challenges throughout the world. Various conservation strategies have been employed to limit these impacts, but often they are not adequately monitored and their effectiveness assessed. Recently, electric fencing has been constructed as a means to mitigate human-wildlife conflict surrounding many Nepalese protected areas. To date, there are no other studies analyzing the cost effectiveness and efficacy of fencing for conservation. This study aims to examine the cost effectiveness of electric fencing in the eastern sector of Chitwan National Park, Nepal, where the fencing has recently been constructed. Great Indian one-horned rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis), wild boar (Sus scrofa), Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), and tiger (Panthera tigris) were the main wildlife species involved in human-wildlife conflict in the buffer zone area surrounding the park, where the fencing was deployed. Electric fencing was significantly effective in reducing crop damage by 78 % and livestock depredation by 30 %- 60 %. Human mortality was not reduced significantly in the study areas and continued at low levels. Our analysis suggested that total net present value of the cost of electric fence in Kagendramalli <b>User</b> <b>Committee</b> (KMUC) and Mrigakunja <b>User</b> <b>Committee</b> (MKUC) was 1 517 959 NPR (Nepalese Rupees, 21 685 USD) and 3 530 075 NPR (50 429 USD) respectively up to the fiscal year 2009 / 10. Net present benefit in KMUC and MKUC was 16 301 105 NPR (232 872 USD) and 38 304 602 NPR (547 208 USD) respectively up to 2009 / 10. The cost-benefit ratio of electric fence up to base fiscal year 2009 / 10 in KMUC is 10. 73, whereas MKUC is 10. 85.

Methods used were stratified random sampling of household economics with questionnaire survey for socio-economic information and quantitative and qualitative analysis for vegetation study. Seventy two households were studied in-depth through household surveys. Vegetation ecology and forest resources were studied in Rakshaniya, Dhaneshwor, Laamitar and Masine forests of the BZ, totaling 37 sample plots. The study recorded a total of 36 tree species from 19 families. Shorea robusta was the dominant tree species in the community forest with highest important percentage, standing volume, biomass and sustainable fuel wood yield. The study area was sufficient to fulfill the demand of the fuel wood and timber in a sustainable way but annual demand of fodder (9640. 54 tons/year) outstripped the annual sustainable supply of fodder (409. 41 total digestible nutrient in tons/year). Thus, community forest was insufficient to provide the resource equally to all seasons and its unequal distribution compelled the locals for illegal extraction of resource showing some pressure on the reserve. In addition, large-scale human interference (Cut Stump Density- 39. 56 /ha and Live Tree Density- 58. 11 /ha) in community forest questioned the endurance of buffering potential and biodiversity conservation.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an assessment of}} the extent and conditions under which private financing can be a realistic approach for sanitation in slums. It is based on a cross-sectional study comparing two slum communities in East Africa, where 250 households from Bwaise III in Kampala, Uganda and 379 households from Temeke in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania were interviewed in 2010. Also, 10 key-informant interviews and 8 focus group discussions were conducted in addition to field observations. Findings show that majority (85 %) of households used unimproved, private-shared pit latrines. These privately owned latrines had many structural shortfalls besides poor operation and maintenance while the public latrines provided by third-party were structurally sound but were under-utilized in residential slum neighorhoods. This is attributed to the presence free or at least cheaper alternatives which the community members preferred instead of paying per-visit user-fees. For the few who were willing to pay, willingness to pay was positively associated with the presence of a facility <b>User</b> <b>committee</b> and having been sensitized. In this context, a combination of these factors made cost recovery as well as operation and maintenance very minimal. The poor status of privately owned shared pit latrines matched the limited income levels of households. Similarly, cost recovery for public facilities was dependent on the number of users who were willing to pay: the more the users, the more the cost recovery. A combination of private and public financing is thus ne cessary to fund different but com plementary aspects of sanitation in slums. </p...|$|E

It gives an account of poor women’s ‘fluid lives’ as they engage in efforts to secure water for their households and participate in water governance at community level where there are persistent water-related problems. The authors conducted a socio-economic study of households in a poor rural parish {{in order to better}} understand women’s safe water access and participation in the management of a healthy community water supply. The study findings confirm that gender remains an important analytical tool for identifying access issues, since gender relations and inequalities are evident in most of the mechanisms of access to water in this community. The chapter explores how women and children remain vulnerable to lack of access to safe water, even where there are community schemes and improved water sources in place, since for the most part powerful, formal positions such as village chairperson, water <b>user</b> <b>committee</b> member, and handpump mechanic continue to be held by men. This is despite the fact that, in the case of water user committees in particular, the 1999 National Water Policy stipulates that women should make up 50 per cent of such committees. In addition, payment arrangements, particularly maintenance and repair fees, frequently result in denying vulnerable children and women physical access to water resources whenever men, as household heads, do not pay these fees. Strategies which seek to improve women’s access to safe water and power in community organization of water remain essential...|$|E

40|$|Many {{resources}} such as supercomputers, legal advisors, and university classrooms are shared by many members of an organization. When the supply of shared resources is limited, conflict usually results between contending demanders. If these conflicts can be adequately resolved, then value is created for the organization. In this paper we use the methodology of applied mechanism design to examine alternative processes for the resolution of such conflicts for a particular class of scheduling problems. We construct a laboratory environment, within which we evaluate the outcomes of various allocation mechanisms. In particular, {{we are able to}} measure efficiency, the value attained by the resulting allocations {{as a percentage of the}} maximum possible value. Our choice of environment and parameters is guided by a specific application, the allocation of time on NASA's Deep Space Network, but the results also provide insights relevant to other scheduling and allocation applications. We find (1) experienced user committees using decision support algorithms produce reasonably efficient allocations in lower conflict situations but perform badly when there is a high level of conflict between demanders, (2) there is a mechanism, called the Adaptive User Selection Mechanism (AUSM) which charges users for time, which yields high efficiencies in high conflict situations but because of the prices paid, the net surplus available to the users is less than that resulting from the inefficient <b>user</b> <b>committee</b> (a reason why users may not appreciate "market solutions" to organization problems) and (3) there is a modification of AUSM in which tokens, or internal money, replaces real money, which results in highly efficient allocations without extracting any of the users' surplus. Although the distribution of surplus is still an issue, the significant increase in efficiency provides users with a strong incentive to replace inefficient user committees with the more efficient AUSM...|$|E

A <b>user</b> <b>committee,</b> gathering contracting authorities, local authorities, and design offices, has been involved in the development of the project since its very beginning. Thermo 2 Pro has two main objectives: to give relevant material to prepare a pre-feasibility study, and to promote geothermal development by facilitating access to the information. The main vector for Thermo 2 Pro is a Web application where the user accesses the information by simulating vertical or horizontal sections and boreholes.

40|$|Several {{trends in}} end {{components}} (longer life time, higher accuracy, higher complexity [...] .) are challenging for the European manufacturing industry. Due {{to the global}} competition, increasing production costs is not an option. Innovation by increased process control meets this challenge. Manufacturers using metal or plastic transformation processes (e. g. deep drawing and injection moulding) recognized this challenge, {{but there is a}} lack of proven technological solutions to control production processes. Measurements of relevant process data were missing. Here, SensoFut started. The necessary in-situ and real-time capture of process data offers tremendous possibilities for many industrial processes and applications. Process data can be used to get a deeper understanding of the many manufacturing processes with the consequence of an increased performance and lifetime of the manufacturing devices plus the opportunity of even further optimization. Important and even critical process parameters for many processes are temperature and pressure. However, for complex processes at high temperatures and / or pressures as well as for positions in components that are difficult to reach, it was complicated or sometimes impossible to obtain in-situ data with the current sensors at the specific desired locations. In many processes or for components in heavily polluted environments, the use of hard durable (lifetime extension) and self-lubricating coatings is already well established. The coatings are made by the use of PVD, CVD or hybrid deposition techniques. In this way it was possible to combine the tribological and sensory function in a multifunctional coating with new properties. Thus, in addition to a protective function, these coatings continuously provided information on temperature and pressure and / or forces. The primary target groups were companies, which manufacture components or work with processes under heavy load (thermal load and / or pressure). Typical industries were aerospace, machining, foundry, metal processing, automotive industry and mechatronics. A second target group consisted of companies across the entire value chain of such sensors. The job coaters can offer such sensor functionality. SensoFut had the following objectives: -Sensor coatings for temperature and pressure, implemented by material combinations, which are pressure and temperature resistant in harsh industrial environments. -Integration of the sensor coating in a process or product in location, which were previously inaccessible or difficult to measure. -A prototype measurement system (and connections to the sensor) that continuously monitors the product / process. -Demonstration of the feasibility in well selected industrial applications that are relevant to the challenges of the target group. By achieving the desired objectives, end users and component developers in Germany and Flanders increased the added value of their products. For example, they are now able to use it up to the limit or integrate new features and services. This had an impact on their competitiveness, production costs and product quality.
