Fetal mice at embryonic day (E) 13. 0 - 18. 5 were used for in situ hybridization studies using [35 S]-labeled RNA probes for IGF-I, IGF-II, IGF-I receptor (-IR), and IGF binding proteins (-BPs). At E 13. 0, IGF-I and IGF-II mRNA were expressed in the mesenchyme around the mandibular bone, but IGF-IR mRNA was not expressed within the bone. At E 14. 0, IGF-I and IGF-I mRNA were expressed in the outer layer of the condylar anlage, and IGF-IR mRNA was first detected within the condylar anlage, suggesting that the presence of IGF-IR mRNA in an IGF-rich environment triggers the initial formation of the condylar cartilage. IGFBP- 4 mRNA was expressed in the anlagen of the artic-ular disc and lower joint cavity from E 15. 0 to 18. 5.

The upper (lower) enclosure is filled with CuO-water (Al 2 O 3 -water) nanofluid. The top and bottom horizontal walls of the trapezoidal enclosures are maintained at constant hot temperature while other inclined walls of the enclosures are at constant cold temperature. Different combinations of Hartmann numbers are imposed on the upper and lower trapezoidal cavities. Numerical simulations are conducted for different values of Rayleigh numbers, Hartmann number and solid volume fraction of the nanofluid by using the finite element method. In the upper and lower trapezoidal cavities magnetic fields with different combinations of Hartmann numbers are imposed.

The base was fabricated by reversibly bonding a 150  μm-thick PDMS sheet with a 10  mm wide circular hole at its center to the glass slide. The 300  μm-thick cantilever chip {{was attached to the}} glass slide {{at the center of the}} hole using UV curable glue (F-UVE- 61, Newport). The thickness of the chip was sufficient (H[*]=[*] 8.6) to exclude any influence of the glass surface on cantilever dynamics. Furthermore, as the thickness of the PDMS sheet (150  μm) was less than the thickness of the chip, access from above was retained. A flat <b>upper</b> <b>cavity</b> surface was fabricated by pouring degassed PDMS onto a silicon wafer to a thickness of about 5  mm and baking for 4  hours at 60 °C.

The diameter exceeded all dimensions of the microcantilevers by at least an order of magnitude to avoid edge effects. The rougher surface of the disc was fixed to a kinematic mirror mount (KM 05 /M, Thorlabs), which was in turn mounted on an encoded piezo motor linear stage (CONEX-AG-LS 25 - 27 P, Newport) with a nominal precision of 0.2  μm.

40|$|AbstractDifferent ions in the pore of the KcsA channel behave differently, and we relate this {{to their}} solvation. We {{show that the}} {{selectivity}} is dependent, in part, on the solvation in the cavity (sometimes {{referred to as the}} vestibule, it is the region containing water molecules between the intracellular gate and the selectivity filter at the extracellular end of the pore). We have shown earlier that potassium is more dependent at {{the upper end of the}} cavity region on solvation by the threonines there, while sodium ion has more water molecules as ligands. In addition, sodium ion is placed asymmetrically, while potassium is nearly exactly symmetric with respect to the four-fold symmetry of the channel. We have now extended these calculations to rubidium and cesium ions, and find that rubidium solvation resembles that of potassium (and both are permeant ions), while cesium resembles sodium (and both are non-permeant), in terms of the geometry of up to eight hydrating, and four non-hydrating, water molecules. In each case, a maximum of 12 water molecules are relevant to the calculation. The placement of the water molecules in the two cases is essentially the same as found from the electron density in the X-ray structure of Zhou and MacKinnon. For Na+ and K+, we show that energy decreases from bulk to the cavity to the lowest position in the selectivity filter (accurate energy could not be calculated for the heavier ions). A separate calculation shows that fixing the Na+ ion at the position of the K+ minimum, followed by re-optimization produced a significantly modified system, not something that could be produced by thermal fluctuations. Moving the K+ into the Na+ position in the <b>upper</b> <b>cavity</b> led to a small increase in energy, ≈ 3  kBT, but was accompanied by large shifts in the positions of hydrating waters, which would create a major kinetic barrier. Therefore, thermal fluctuations could not invalidate the conclusions of the main calculations...|$|E

40|$|This study {{developed}} a solution algorithm {{based on the}} function specification method to solve the inverse heat conduction equations. By this solution, the casting-die interfacial heat transfer coefficients(IHTC) in light metal squeeze castings were determined accurately and the pressurized solidification was simulated precisely. This goal was accomplished in the four stages. First, a model was developed to simulate fluid flow in forced convection and heat transfer in pressurized solidification of a cylindrical simple shape squeeze casting. Pressure-dependent heat transfer coefficients (HTC) and non-equilibrium solidification temperatures were determined by experimental measurements. With the measured HTC and temperatures under the different pressures, the temperature distributions and the cooling behaviours of squeeze cast were simulated. In the second stage, a different wall-thickness 5 -step casting mould was designed, and squeeze casting of magnesium alloy AM 60 was performed under an applied pressure 30, 60 and 90 MPa in a hydraulic press. With measured temperatures, heat fluxes and IHTCs were evaluated using the polynomial curve fitting method and numerical inverse method. The accuracy of these curves was analyzed by the direct modeling calculation. The results indicated that heat flux and IHTCs determined by the inverse method were more accurately than those from the extrapolated fitting method. In the third stage, the inverse method was applied to an aluminum alloy A 443 and magnesium alloy AM 60. As the applied hydraulic pressure increased, the IHTC peak value of each step was increased accordingly. Compared to the thin steps at the <b>upper</b> <b>cavity,</b> the relatively thick steps attained higher peak IHTCs and heat fluxes values due to high local pressures and high melt temperature. The empirical equations relating IHTC to the local pressures and solidification temperature at the casting surface were derived and summarized.

The {{results showed that the}} numerical calculated temperatures were in well agreement with experimental ones.

The features of these quasiparticles promise a variety of applications, for instance lasing without inversion and micro-optical parametric amplifiers, and an environment to study fundamental physics, such as Bose-Einstein condensation in the solid state. By overcoming the longstanding fabrication problems of ZnSe-based microcavities, the enlarged exciton binding energy in combination with the use of highly reflective dielectric mirrors makes this material system ideally suited to the realisation of polariton-based devices operating at room temperature. An epitaxial liftoff technology is developed that relies on the high etch selectively between the ZnSe heterostructure and a novel II-VI release layer, MgS. Three hybrid microcavities are fabricated with the liftoff technique and spectroscopically characterised. Angle resolved transmission experiments reveal strong hybridization of the ZnSe/Zn 0 : 9 Cd 0 : 1 Se quantum well excitons and cavity photons in a fixed microcavity. A completely length tunable microcavity is presented and shown to exhibit similar dispersion as for the fixed microcavity, with the addition of evidencing the cavity polariton bottleneck effect. The nonlinear optical features are discussed. Photoluminescence data is presented that evidences the first observation of the build up of cavity polaritons at the edge of the momentum space trap in the lower polariton branch, the bottleneck effect, in a ZnSe based microcavity.

40|$|Combustion {{instability}} in premixed combustors mostly arises {{due to the}} coupling between heat release rate dynamics and system acoustics. It is crucial to understand the instability mechanisms to design reliable, high efficiency, low emission gas turbine combustors. In this thesis, elementary processes acting {{as a source of}} unsteady heat release rate are described. These elementary processes are acoustic wave-flame interactions, flame-vortex interactions, equivalence ratio fluctuations, flame-wall interactions and the unsteady stretch rate. To investigate the flame- vortex interaction mechanism, a parametric study is performed in single and double expansion dump combustors. 2 -D simulations are performed using the random vortex method combined with thin flame model of premixed combustion. The inlet velocity of the combustor is forced sinusoidally at various amplitudes and frequencies, and the heat release rate response is evaluated. It is shown that the heat release rate dynamics are governed by the cyclical formation of a large wake vortex and its interaction with the flame. Maximum heat release rate in a cycle is reached a short time after the breakup of the vortex, which causes rapid burning of the reactants trapped within the structure. The geometry and operating conditions of the combustor control the mechanism by which the vortex breakup is initiated. For short cavities, the impingement of the large wake vortex onto the forward facing step is responsible from the vortex breakup. (cont.) On the other hand, in long cavities, the vortex breakup is initiated as the wake vortex impinges on the <b>upper</b> <b>cavity</b> wall in single expansion dump combustor, or the vortex forming in {{the other half of the}} combustor in double expansion dump combustor. Furthermore, the effect of the air injection in the cross stream direction close to the dump plane on equivalence ratio is investigated. It is shown experimentally that high amplitude pressure oscillation in the combustor during unstable operation causes fluctuation in the injected jet velocity. The oscillatory jet velocity affects the incoming equivalence ratio depending on the momentum ratio of the jet to the primary stream. A critical momentum ratio is defined at which the amplitude of the equivalence ratio oscillations reaches a maximum. by Hurrem Murat Altay. Thesis (S. M.)

50|$|The horse's {{olfactory}} receptors {{are located}} in the mucosa of the <b>upper</b> nasal <b>cavity.</b> Due to the length of the nasal cavity, there is a large area of these receptors, and the horse has a better ability to smell than a human. Additionally, the horse also has a vomeronasal organ, or Jacobson's Organ, which is in the hard palate, and is able to pick up pheromones and other scents when a horse exhibits the flehmen response. The flehmen response forces air through slits in the nasal cavity and into the vomeronasal organ. Unlike many other animals, the horse's Jacobson's Organ doesn't open into the oral cavity.|$|R

In this work, an improved model representing PD behaviour within a spherical cavity in a homogeneous dielectric material has been developed to study the influence of cavity surface charge distribution on the electric field distribution in the cavity. Comparison of measurement and simulation results has been undertaken to validate the model. The model uses a two-dimensional axial symmetric Finite Element Analysis method, which is solved for local electric potentials. The model geometry consists of a homogenous dielectric material and a spherical <b>cavity.</b> The <b>upper</b> and lower <b>cavity</b> surfaces are divided into 10 boundaries each to model charge distribution along the cavity wall. Discharge is assumed to occur along the symmetry axis in the cavity. Once the discharge has passed through the cavity to the opposite surface, it is assumed that charge then propagates along the <b>upper</b> and lower <b>cavity</b> surfaces. Charge distribution is assumed symmetrical on the <b>upper</b> and lower <b>cavity</b> surfaces. During discharge, charge density increases on the cavity surface boundaries where charge propagates, until the field in the cavity centre is less than the extinction field. To model the charge movement along the cavity wall through conduction at other times, the change in the charge density on each cavity surface boundary is set as dependent on the cavity surface conductivity. Thus, cavity surface charge distribution will influence the electric field distribution in the cavity, affecting the likelihood of the next PD event...|$|R
