40|$|The {{systemic}} {{transformation of}} post-socialist countries from central planning {{to a market}} economy was a very complex and unprecedented <b>undertaking.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> we critically examine three influential classifications proposed by Coates [2000, 2006], Hall and Soskice [2001], and Amable [2003], within the “comparative capitalisms” literature stream, and argue that they are unsuitable for evaluating the progress made by transition economies since 1990. The basis of the criticism stems from timing: these theoretical frameworks were developed primarily to evaluate the growth of advanced and mature capitalist countries. Thus, they fail to capture the unique features of transition economies and the complexity of the transformation process that led to the emergence of different market-based systems. From this vantage point, we discusses and also critique a recent classification developed by Myant and Drahokoupil [2011, 2015], who distinguish five ideal models (i. e. “varieties of capitalism”) that have evolved within transition countries. In our conclusion we point to areas within the field that may be explored by future research...|$|R
40|$|<b>In</b> <b>this</b> {{paper we}} {{investigate}} {{the dynamics of}} one-way delays in an operational mobile core network. Our final goal is to develop anomaly detection schemes for the packet delay process in order to reveal network and equipment problems. This requires a preliminary exploration of the delay process in the core network, which we <b>undertake</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study.</b> We present one-way delay measurements extracted from passive traces captured at an operational GPRS/UMTS network. We find that queuing is {{the only source of}} delay at GGSNs, while for SGSNs the mobility and flow-control further complicate the characterization of the “normal ” delay behavior. Moreover, the presence of unwanted traffic has an impact on the delay statistics and should be taken into account. We find that information about actual bandwidth conditions in the Radio Network may be inferred by investigating packet delays in the core network. Our explorative results are promising about the possibility of Third-generation (3 G) mobile networks play an increasingly important role in the telecommunication market. Operators of a 3 G infrastructure must cope with a usage environment that is rapidly evolving, as new applications emerge and terminal capabilities increase continuously.

40|$|Transit and radial {{velocity}} searches are two techniques for identifying nearby extrasolar planets to Earth that transit bright stars. Identifying a robust sample of these exoplanets around bright stars for detailed atmospheric characterization {{is a major}} observational <b>undertaking.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> we describe a framework that answers {{the question of whether}} a transit or {{radial velocity}} survey is more efficient at finding transiting exoplanets given the same amount of observing time. Within the framework we show that a transit survey's window function can be approximated using the hypergeometric probability distribution. We estimate the observing time required for a transit survey to find a transiting Earth-sized exoplanet in the HZ with an emphasis on late type stars. We also estimate the radial velocity precision necessary to detect the equivalent HZ Earth-mass exoplanet that also transits when using an equal amount of observing time as the transit survey. We find that a radial velocity survey with sig_rv~ 0. 6 m/s precision has comparable efficiency in terms of observing time to a transit survey with the requisite photometric precision sig_phot~ 300 ppm to find a transiting Earth-sized exoplanet in the HZ of late M~dwarfs. For Super-Earths, a sig_rv~ 2. 0 m/s precision radial velocity survey has comparable efficiency to a transit survey with sig_phot~ 2300 ppm. Comment: 12 Pages, 9 Figures, Submitted Ap...|$|R

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{scattering}} characteristics of ridging patterns in agriculture {{by the use}} of C-band polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images. The polarimetric signatures of periodic potato fields and row wheat in different directions are highlighted using a set of polarimetric parameters. Enhanced coherent scattering is observed when the alignment direction of the ridging patterns is perpendicular to the radar's line of sight (LOS). The dominant backscattering mechanism of the ridging patterns is deduced by evaluating different polarimetric parameters. The increased copolarized backscattering coefficients and copolarized correlation coefficient, and the reduced entropy and polarimetric alpha angle, indicate a strong contribution of odd scattering to ridging patterns aligned perpendicular to the LOS. We also compare the dominant contributions to the backscattering of ridging patterns in different phenological stages. Although the canopy changes of potato and wheat with time are significant, the underlying periodic surface changes the dominant scattering mechanism of potato fields over all the phenological stages, and the wheat aligned parallel with the flight direction of radar still has relatively high coherent scattering in the different vegetation development stages. The variability analyses <b>undertake</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> allow a more detailed documentation of the physical scattering process of the ridging patterns in agriculture, and will improve the applicability of synthetic aperture radar images in agriculture.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to present a thorough analysis of image formation among first-time visitors to an Aboriginal (Mi’kmaw) cultural site. The thesis is an initial attempt to examine theories in consumer behaviour and reformulate a model in the destination image literature to empirically test the influence of personal (motivation, cognition-affect) and stimulus (promotional) factors on impression of an Aboriginal tourist destination. To gather primary data, visitors to The Glooscap Heritage Centre, in the Province of Nova Scotia, Canada completed a self-administered questionnaire. In total there were 309 valid samples. Over 80 % of respondents <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> were interested <b>in</b> exploring cultural heritage, learning about cultures and ways of life (motives) and visiting cultural attractions (cognitive). Affectively, respondents felt the destination would be a pleasant (4. 37 / 5), relaxing (4. 10 / 5) and exciting (4. 07 / 5) place to visit. Survey results imply most tourists were exposed to the tour guide’s message (82 %), followed by the tour operator (53 %), then the brochure (29 %), and finally the travel agent’s information (19 %). However, exposure did not correlate with effectiveness in image formation. The brochure impacted image the most (4. 33 / 5), next was the tour operator (4. 12 / 5), followed by the tour guide (4. 08 / 5) and lastly the travel agent (3. 9 / 5). Survey results imply the destination can more effectively use its key communication tools to enhance its image. Current study findings provide important implications and can aid in the design of marketing campaigns to create and improve Aboriginal destination image. One significant <b>undertaking</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> was to draw upon the actions of other key regions and situate thesis results in the wider context of Aboriginal tourism growth. The role of <b>this</b> research <b>in</b> relation to destination development is considered broadening the implications to a global setting beyond the immediate context of the study...|$|R
