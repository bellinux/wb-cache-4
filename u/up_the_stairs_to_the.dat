5|$|A book {{published}} in November 2011, Seal Target Geronimo, by Chuck Pfarrer, a former SEAL, contradicted the account {{as given by}} U.S. government sources. According to Pfarrer, neither helicopter crashed {{at the beginning of}} the raid. Instead, the SEALs jumped onto the roof from the hovering Razor 1 helicopter and entered a third-floor hallway from the roof terrace. Osama's third wife, Khairah, was in the hallway, headed towards the SEALs. She was blinded by a strobe light and pushed to the floor as the SEALs went past her. Osama bin Laden stuck his head out of a bedroom door, saw the SEALs, and slammed the door closed. At the same time, Osama's son Khalid bin Laden ran <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> third floor and was killed with two shots.|$|E

25|$|Route 67 is {{a walking}} trail {{consisting}} of 67 public artworks, symbolising 67 years which Nelson ‘Madiba’ Mandela {{dedicated to the}} freedom of South Africa. The artwork is a celebration of South African culture and history and is scattered along the route as it starts from the Campanile, <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Vuysile Mini Market Square and to the large South African flag at the Donkin Reserve. The artworks were created by local Eastern Cape artists.|$|E

25|$|Legere {{was convicted}} {{in the murder of}} shopkeeper John Glendenning, of Black River Bridge, New Brunswick, which {{occurred}} on the evening of June 21, 1986. After cutting the power, Legere and his accomplices Todd Matchett and Scott Curtis, broke into the elderly couple's store. After repeatedly beating John and his wife Mary, the trio fled the scene. Mary then discovered her husband (who had been beaten to death); she crawled <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> phone and dialed 911. The dispatcher spoke with Mary on the phone until the emergency forces arrived. Police tracked down the three and arrested them. Matchett pleaded guilty to murdering John Glendenning and brutally beating his wife Mary; Curtis and Legere were convicted at trial.|$|E
25|$|The {{entrance}} is {{situated at the}} back of the Saw Plaza. The exterior queue line consists of mock razor wire fences and various large torture implements rusting on the ground (most of which come from the films). Walkie talkie announcements are heard from policemen inside the building, often sounding as if they are panicking. Loud ambient music is played throughout the area. The queue travels around the back of the warehouse and then into the building itself. Inside, riders walk through a dimly lit corridor, with four shotguns hanging from the ceiling. The guns 'fire' every few minutes to give a jump effect. The corridor leads up some stairs past a cage with a trap (the Rack from Saw III) seen in it. On special occasions, live actors are placed in this cage and act as Jigsaw's victims. Travelling up the stairs, Billy the Puppet can be seen and heard on TV monitors <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> station. Above the queue, a body is seen tangled in barbed wire (referencing the first Saw), before the queue goes into the station. In here, mannequin parts are fixed in various small devices or hanging from the walls, and misted windows flash on the wall opposite the queue.|$|E
500|$|The song is {{performed}} on the Speak Now World Tour. Clips of the performance {{can be seen in}} the music video for Swift's single [...] "Sparks Fly". In the clips we see a bride wearing [...] "a gown shaped like a pastry" [...] as she walks <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> groom and preacher. Swift {{can be seen in the}} background making a scene during this clip. Other clips show the bridesmaids waving, the bride getting onto them while the groom is clapping and the groom running off with Swift. According to Jocelyn Vena of MTV.com, the performance is [...] "a very theatrical moment" [...] in which [...] "Swift acted out crashing a wedding. She eventually stole the groom away, as she sings in the song, and the pair ran through the crowd together." ...|$|E

500|$|One of {{the most}} notorious and widely {{condemned}} scenes in Gone with the Wind depicts what is now legally defined as [...] "marital rape". The scene begins with Scarlett and Rhett {{at the bottom of the}} staircase, where he begins to kiss her, refusing to be told 'no' by the struggling and frightened Scarlett; Rhett overcomes her resistance and carries her <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bedroom, where the audience is left in no doubt that she will [...] "get what's coming to her". The next scene, the following morning, shows Scarlett glowing with barely suppressed sexual satisfaction; Rhett apologizes for his behavior, blaming it on his drinking. The scene has been accused of combining romance and rape by making them indistinguishable from each other, and of reinforcing a notion about forced sex: that women secretly enjoy it, and it is an acceptable way for a man to treat his wife.|$|E
2500|$|The {{vote of censure}} was {{defeated}} by 313 votes to 295, with Palmerston's old enemies in the pacifist camp, Cobden and Bright, voting for him. The result of the vote was announced at 2:30 in the morning, and when Palmerston heard the news he ran <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ladies' Gallery and embraced his wife. Disraeli wrote: [...] "What pluck to mount those dreadful stairs at {{three o'clock in the}} morning, and eighty years of age!" ...|$|E

[...] Haq then said, [...] "I'm only doing this for a statement," [...] and proceeded to follow the girl <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second floor. Haq stopped to ask receptionist Layla Bush about speaking with a manager, {{at which point the}} girl walked to a bathroom and locked herself inside. At this point, Cheryl Stumbo asked fellow employee Carol Goldman to call 911. But, before Goldman could complete a call, Haq shot Goldman in the knee. Stumbo's niece, in the bathroom, heard her and dialed 911.|$|E

2500|$|The Voyages {{station is}} themed as a 17th-century ship, with the {{basement}} being the cargo hold, {{the second level}} being the deck, and the ride operator's controls being the [...] "Captain's Quarters". The station has three levels: a ground floor, a second floor, and a basement. Before entering the station, guests may be redirected to several outdoor queue switchbacks. Once the switchbacks have been navigated, guests enter {{the ground floor of}} the station. The ground floor includes two staircases to the basement; however, most of it is composed of maintenance areas. Depending {{on the size of the}} line, the park may or may not open the basement. If the basement is open, guests will walk down the stairs immediately after entering the ground floor of the station. The basement is filled with nothing but queue switchbacks. Once these switchbacks have been navigated, guests will walk <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground floor before continuing <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second floor. The second floor of the station holds the roller coaster's loading and unloading areas, as well as the two transfer tracks and maintenance bays. On the loading side of the station there are fourteen air-powered queue gates, one for each row of the train. On the unloading side of the station there are free shelves and lockers that riders may use to hold their belongings for the duration of the ride. The unloading side is also home to the ride operator's controls and two exit gates: a sliding gate near the front of the train and a swinging gate near the rear of the train. Beyond the unloading side of the station is an area that holds two maintenance bays. These allow unused trains to be stored during normal operation and also provides an additional area for maintenance crews to inspect the roller coaster trains.|$|E

50|$|Stairs {{were also}} {{constructed}} to contain trick or stumble steps. These were steps that had different rise height or tread depth {{from the rest}} and would cause anyone running <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> stumble or fall, so slowing down the attackers' progress.|$|R
