Some researchers were quick to identify the potential uses and benefits of podcasting for language learning (Belanger, 2005; Clark & Walsh, 2005; Kaplan-Leiserson, 2005; Manning, 2006; Meng, 2005; Moody, 2006; Scinicariello, 2006; Sloan, 2005; Stanley, 2006; Thorne & Payne, 2005). However, “research into students’ experience of podcasting is in its very early stages” (Edirisingha, Rizzi, Nie, & Rothwell, 2007, p. 88). This chapter presents a review of how podcasting fits with language-learning theories (including constructivist approaches, the use of authentic materials, and informal and lifelong learning, among others), what features were identified as potential benefits of podcasting for language learning and what evidence we have now to support those claims. It focuses on the learning experience of the end users by examining a number of reports into students’ use of podcasting resources.

World Ocean Council, with funding from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, undertook a project to inform and, as appropriate, engage a diverse range of ocean industries on marine planning and encourage the use of credible science and risk assessment. With information gathered through literature reviews, case studies, interviews, and outreach, this paper presents potential benefits of and concerns regarding marine planning from the ocean business perspective.

We analysed the geospatial distributions of different soil types in the ‘Las Batuecas – Sierra de Francia’ and ‘Quilamas’ natural areas using soil sampling and laboratory analyses to determine the soil associations and dominant soil types and so create toposequence maps. These maps {{were used to assess}} potential soil <b>uses</b> <b>and</b> <b>resources</b> and to identify environmental problems from natural and/or anthropogenic causes. The GIS techniques used in this study provide georeferenced maps of forming factors and soil distribution {{that can be used to}} create databases that include fact sheets and photographs of the soil profiles. This soil information was exported in ‘kmz’ format to geospatially visualise the different soil units in 3 D virtual tours using the Google Earth platform.

Understanding {{the intricacies}} of the production structure of a given region or country {{is as important as the}} planning and action phases, and as complex in terms of implementation and deepening processes. It was with this kind of motivation that this project examined in some detail the production structure of the Amazon state, choosing as time reference the year 2006. To reach the main objective of this project, it was left aside the technique of Regional Social Accounting to be able to order in a more coherent and consistent manner the necessary information that resulted in macroeconomic aggregates. The main tool used was the construction of some quadrants as of production (A 1), intermediate consumption (B 1) and value added components (C), all of those components of the Table of <b>Uses</b> <b>and</b> <b>Resources</b> of goods and services of the Amazon. The results generated tabulations producing levels of aggregation in ranges of 110 products by 56 activities, 17 products by 17 activities and 12 products by 12 activities, respecting in all cases statistical confidentiality due to imposition of non-identification in some specific cases. Furthermore, the project followed with analysis and discussions, in which were always presented comparisons that refer to the information contained in the Brazil?s TRU.

40|$|During {{the second}} half of this century {{offshore}} sand extraction has become commonplace. There has been an important increase of sand demand to use on construction and coastal protection as well as for industrial purposes. On the other hand, the development in the dredging field has helped to the expansion of the process. Since nearshore dredging is an alteration in a very dynamic environment with important consequences, it is sought to find the minimal depth where a trench can be dredged without affecting the coastal stability and neither considers an excessive restriction. The trivial solution would be to extract in deep bottoms, but the price of these operations (they become more expensive with increasing distance offshore) and also sediment availability makes it unrealistic. Is in this context of <b>uses</b> <b>and</b> <b>resources</b> where this work is done. First, trying to recognise which are the potential effects of nearshore dredging on coastal stability and next, looking if there is data enough to prove them. Then, after identifying the main effects, a methodology to prevent these impacts is proposed, i. e. some engineering rules to minimise the impacts and select the zones to be dredged. Theoretically nearshore dredging and the resulting trench can affect the hydrodynamics, the sediment transport and control the coastal behaviour and, as a consequence, the coastal stability, through different mechanisms: the interaction with longshore sediment transport, the beach drawdown, the interception of the onshore sediment transport in the inner shelf, the modification of wave characteristics, the modification of wave's field of velocity and the trench propagation to the coast. There are different depth criterion to prevent each of these impacts but at the same time, the ones associated to some of them are exceeded by others. Thus, the way to select the depth criterion to prevent all of them must be based on the most restrictive one. On the other hand, it has been observed that other impacts just would verify in particular kind of beaches or coasts (e. g. the interception of onshore transport) or within long time scales (e. g. trench propagation) and although potentially {{they would be able to}} affect the coastal stability, they will mainly verify in very specific coastal stretches and, in consequence, they are not very common. Finally, and after analysing several reported coastal responses, three effects have been identified as the most likely to happen and therefore, some rules are necessary to be sure they will be avoided: beach drawdown, trench propagation and wave's modification. To avoid the called beach drawdown, trenches should be done seawards of the depth of closure d,. Therefore it is necessary to find this threshold depth of significant vertical changes, but since it has been demonstrated that it is time and space dependant it is not a trivial task. However, a first assessment of the minimum depth can be done using Hallermeier's equation fed by extremal wave conditions, selected to be representative of a return period according to the life period of the trench, e. g. Tretum> 25 years. It has been tried to represent trench propagation with a process-based model, but the results have been just qualitative and not quantitative. However, it can exist so to keep sediment transport gradients small and avoid it, trenches should have little depth or be in depths where the transport rates are small. A general criterion could be to dredge seawards of the depth that represents the beginning of significant sediment transport, which at the same time would avoid the interception of the onshore transport in the inner shelf. The third effect is the modification of wave characteristics. It induces longshore sediment transport gradients that suppose a change in shoreline development as it has been observed in nature. This effect will be significant in long coasts such that their behaviour is conditioned by the longshore sediment transport, but there it will be less important if trenches are shallow and not very wide (less than 400 m, Viguier et al., 1984).

40|$|In {{the fifties}} and sixties of 20 th century, the {{regional}} economists identified a regional process of circular and cumulative causation of under- development of resource-rich but backward regions (Myrdal) and core-periphery relation of developed industrial regions with resource hinterland regions (Friedman). In the seventies, {{environment and development}} conflicts were identified leading to ecological and socio-economic degradation in the resource regions. In the regional framework, the tribal regions as sub-national regions have come under serious anthropogenic impacts due to increasing demands for resource materials for trade and industries. Growing awareness of environmental degradation and depletion, the policy makers, planners, environmentalist and economists have focused their attention to examine the efficiencies of land <b>use</b> <b>and</b> the <b>resource</b> <b>use</b> in agriculture, identifying the ecological and economic efficiencies of the resource use pattern. Agriculture, being an organic economic activity, has a close relation with the natural <b>resources</b> like land <b>and</b> water. The tribal ecology is changing and the tribes have gradually adapted to agriculture activities and a distinct agro-ecosystem has grown in tribal areas. The tribes are trying to diversify the resource use for their ecological and economic sustenance. The government is also influencing <b>resource</b> <b>use</b> <b>and</b> land <b>use</b> as development strategy in the tribal region. It is necessary to examine the land <b>use</b> <b>and</b> the <b>resource</b> <b>use</b> efficiencies in the agricultural areas in regional and temporal framework. Land <b>use</b> <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> <b>use</b> efficiencies have been measured to evaluate ecologic and economic efficiency and growth in agriculture. Since, agriculture operates in system dynamic framework in which agriculture has close relation with other uses like forestry in ecological landscape in eco-regional framework and is affected by climatic change and other anthropogenic impacts resulting from industrialization and urbanization. {{it is necessary to}} identify the land <b>use</b> <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> <b>use</b> efficiencies in agriculture in the tribal eco-system. Along with land, other natural resources like water are important in agriculture. The efficiency of irrigation may be an indicator to identify the <b>use</b> of water <b>resource</b> <b>and</b> its efficiency in agriculture. The land <b>use</b> <b>and</b> irrigation intensity are used as an indicators for measuring land <b>use</b> <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> <b>use</b> efficiency in this study.
