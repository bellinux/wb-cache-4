5000|$|Advertisers often refine {{direct mail}} {{practices}} into targeted mailing, in which mail is sent following database analysis to select recipients considered {{most likely to}} respond positively. [...] This reduces costs for mailers by narrowing the mailing universe to only the most likely audience. For example, {{a person who has}} demonstrated an interest in golf may receive direct mail for golf-related products, or perhaps for goods and services that are appropriate for golfers. This use of database analysis is a type of database marketing. Alternatively, <b>unaddressed</b> <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> may be sent on a neighbourhood-by-neighbourhood basis. Whether at the individual or neighbourhood level, direct mail marketing allows recipients to be targeted, attempting to match the demographic profile of the recipients to one most closely matching that of likely customers. Individually targeted direct mail may be tailored based on previous transactions and gathered data. For example, all male recipients of an offer may receive a personalized package with a man’s picture on the cover, while all female recipients receive a picture of a woman.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Implementation of new {{guidelines}} into clinical practice is often incomplete. <b>Direct</b> <b>mail</b> {{is a simple}} way of providing information to physicians and may improve implementation of {{new guidelines}} on basic life support (BLS). The {{aim of this study}} was to describe knowledge of the most recent European Resuscitation Council (ERC) Guidelines for BLS among general practitioners (GPs) and investigate whether <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> improves theoretical knowledge of these guidelines. Methods All general practice clinics (n= 351) in Central Denmark Region were randomised to receive either <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> (intervention) or no <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> (control). The <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> consisted of the official ERC BLS/AED poster and a cover letter outlining changes in compression depth and frequency in the new guidelines. In general practice clinics randomised to intervention, every GP received a <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> addressed personally to him/her. Two weeks later, a multiple-choice questionnaire on demographics and BLS guidelines were mailed to GPs in both groups. Results In total, 830 GPs were included in this study (<b>direct</b> <b>mail,</b> n= 408; control, n= 422). The response rate was 58 %. The majority (91 %) of GPs receiving <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> were familiar with BLS Guidelines 2010 compared to 72 % in the control group (P Conclusion <b>Direct</b> <b>mail</b> improved knowledge of changes in BLS guidelines and thus facilitated the implementation of this knowledge into clinical practice. Resuscitation councils and medical societies may consider using <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> as a simple strategy to facilitate implementation of changes in clinical guidelines. </p...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{we have seen}} {{significant}} increases in Internet activity and the adoption of new digital technology for sending and receiving communications. According to numerous reports, email now accounts for over 70 % of Internet activity. As Internet usage has increased, Internet advertising, and in particular email advertising, has evolved from simple-text, untargeted mass mailings to visually sophisticated highly-targeted interactive communication. ^ This study sought to compare and examine attitudes toward and responses to two forms of permission-based direct advertising – online <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> campaigns to traditional, postal <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> campaigns to determine what are the qualities peculiar to email advertising and its adopters and attitudes towards this medium that have lead to its adoption, acceptance, and possible preference as a channel of marketing communication. Self-administered surveys were sent via email and postal mail to a randomly selected sample of 400 supporters of a National Public Radio station housed at a large southwestern university. ^ Results showed that online <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> was not {{more likely to be}} responded to by study participants than traditional <b>direct</b> <b>mail,</b> did not generate more positive attitudes than traditional <b>direct</b> <b>mail,</b> and was no more likely to be read than traditional <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> advertising. However, online <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> advertising was viewed as prompting more radio station membership renewals, particularly among email survey respondents, suggesting that that online <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> advertising may result in more sales than traditional <b>direct</b> <b>mail.</b> ^ In examining the affects of demographics on the effectiveness of advertising media delivered through either online or <b>direct</b> <b>mail,</b> results showed that demographics make a significance difference in responses and attitudes, particularly in perceptions of convenience and ease-of-use of email advertising. ^ Keywords. <b>Direct</b> <b>mail</b> advertising, email advertising, permission-based marketing, advertising effectiveness. ...|$|R
50|$|Today, batch {{prescreen}} is {{ubiquitous in}} the financial industry. The most common method for distributing batch prescreen offers is <b>direct</b> <b>mail.</b> During {{the first quarter of}} 2010, U.S consumers received 481 million <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> prescreen credit offers which represents a 29 percent increase on the 372.4 million mailed {{in the first quarter of}} 2009. However, as the volume of <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> prescreen offers increases, the acceptance rate of those offers tends to decrease. The reason for this inverse correlation is that the number of U.S consumers interested in responding to <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> prescreen offers tends to remain relatively static. <b>Direct</b> <b>Mail</b> prescreen, while compelling to some consumers, just doesn't appeal to everyone.

Results of a field study indicate that one type of <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> (a shopper) contributes significantly to sales when used independently. When combined with national or local advertising, however, the contribution level of this shopper decreases. Conversely, a <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> insert combined with many others inserts into one single envelope is much more powerful when utilized in conjunction with national advertising. In fact, results show that this latter combination of <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> with national advertising contributes more to average weekly unit sales than any other combination.

The main factors of the demand {{are found to be}} various price indicators with respect to individual market, two income series and the variable of economic environment. The results of our empirical analysis suggest that the price elasticity of demand on both markets is below zero. The autonomy in price increases is limited due to positive cross-price elasticity of demand for <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> with regard to price fluctuations for TV commercials. Substitution effects on the <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> market are even more evident with regard to price fluctuations for advertisements in magazines and daily papers. An additional finding is that the demand on both markets varies seasonally in all models estimated by us. Finally, coefficients of income elasticity of demand for <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> services show that the total number of mail deliveries on the <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> market increases faster than the retail revenue in real terms...|$|R

In order to better understand the state of <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> in China, the researcher conducted six detailed interviews with five Chinese printers and one advertising agency. The result showed that with the purchase of digital presses, four of the five printing companies are capable of producing all levels of customized <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> from versioning to highly personalized print. But all of them indicated that digital printing only occupies very limited portion of their annual production output. However, some printing companies interviewed regarded <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> as one of their major products, which generate most of their revenue. Moreover, their <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> job volumes are quite stable mostly due to long-term cooperation with same group of customers, such as banks and publishers. But according to the ad agency interviewed, the usage of <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> decreased noticeably in recent times due to the emerging and growing E-marketing channels like social media. In addition, most clients of that ads agency have specific marketing plans, which are based on marketing budget, return on investment (ROI) and creativity, therefore its challenging to persuade clients to utilize <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> because of its high production cost.
