2500|$|Hubbert's <b>upper-bound</b> estimate, {{which he}} {{regarded}} as optimistic, accurately predicted that US oil production would peak in 1970, although the actual peak was 17% higher than Hubbert's curve. Production declined, as Hubbert had predicted, and stayed within 10 percent of Hubbert's predicted value from 1974 through 1994; since then, actual production has been {{significantly greater than}} the Hubbert curve. The development of new technologies has provided access to large quantities of unconventional resources, and the boost of production has largely discounted Hubbert's prediction.|$|E
2500|$|A {{variant of}} Kolmogorov {{complexity}} {{is defined as}} follows : [...] The complexity of a number n is the smallest number of states needed for a BB-class Turing machine that halts with a single block of n consecutive 1s on an initially blank tape. [...] The corresponding variant of Chaitin's incompleteness theorem states that, {{in the context of a}} given axiomatic system for the natural numbers, there exists a number k such that no specific number can be proved to have complexity greater than k, and hence that no specific upper bound can be proven for Σ(k) (the latter is because [...] "the complexity of n is greater than k" [...] would be proved if [...] "n > Σ(k)" [...] were proved). As mentioned in the cited reference, for any axiomatic system of [...] "ordinary mathematics" [...] the least value k for which this is true is far less than 10↑↑10; consequently, in the context of ordinary mathematics, neither the value nor any <b>upper-bound</b> of Σ(10 ↑↑ 10) can be proven. (Gödel's first incompleteness theorem is illustrated by this result: in an axiomatic system of ordinary mathematics, there is a true-but-unprovable sentence of the form [...] "Σ(10 ↑↑ 10) = n", and there are infinitely many true-but-unprovable sentences of the form [...] "Σ(10 ↑↑ 10) < n".) ...|$|E
