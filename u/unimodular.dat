25|$|When {{the rank}} of the form is greater than about 28, the number of {{positive}} definite <b>unimodular</b> forms starts to increase extremely rapidly with the rank, so there are huge numbers of corresponding simply connected topological 4-manifolds (most of which seem to be of almost no interest).|$|E
25|$|There are however some {{important}} subclasses of IP and MIP {{problems that are}} efficiently solvable, most notably problems where the constraint matrix is totally <b>unimodular</b> and the right-hand sides of the constraints are integers or – more general – where the system has the total dual integrality (TDI) property.|$|E

25|$|One common way {{of proving}} that a {{polyhedron}} is integral {{is to show}} that it is totally <b>unimodular.</b> There are other general methods including the integer decomposition property and total dual integrality. Other specific well-known integral LPs include the matching polytope, lattice polyhedra, submodular flow polyhedra, and the intersection of 2 generalized polymatroids/g-polymatroids --- e.g. see Schrijver 2003.|$|E
25|$|This {{definition}} {{can also}} be extended where K is a commutative ring R, in which case a matrix is invertible {{if and only if}} its determinant is an invertible element in R. For example, a matrix A with entries in Z, the integers, is invertible (in the sense that there exists an inverse matrix with integer entries) if the determinant is +1 or −1. Such a matrix is called <b>unimodular.</b>|$|E
25|$|Let G be {{a compact}} abelian group, μ the {{normalized}} Haar measure, and T a group automorphism of G.

The automorphism T is ergodic {{if and only if}} the equality (T*)n(χ)nbsp&=nbsp&χ is possible only when nnbsp&=nbsp&0 or χ is the trivial character of G.

5000|$|A totally <b>unimodular</b> matrix (TU matrix) is {{a matrix}} for which every square {{non-singular}} submatrix is <b>unimodular.</b> A totally <b>unimodular</b> matrix {{need not be}} square itself.
