As had Air Force, Tech picked <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of first downs. But like Air Force, the opposition's defense forced a punt near midfield.

25|$|The Sooners, {{after moving}} <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> spots in both polls, {{would take on}} Randy Shannon's Miami team {{in front of a}} record-breaking 85,357 people at Oklahoma Memorial Stadium. The Sooners were favored to defeat the ACC team by 10 to 11 points. Sam Bradford {{followed}} his record-breaking debut with another, completing 19 of his 25 pass attempts for 205 yards and tying the school record for most touchdown passes in a game with five. In addition, he extended his record-tying streak of consecutive pass completions to claim the record for his own. Bradford finished his first game with 18-straight pass completions. He came into his second game with four more straight completions, breaking the old record. Through two games, Bradford had completed 83% of his passes, had as many touchdown passes as incompletions (eight), and was ranked number one in the country for passing efficiency. For his performance, he was named the Walter Camp National Player of the Week and the Big 12 Offensive Player of the Week.|$|E
25|$|Although {{they would}} win the 1947–48 Sheffield Shield Western Australia were its weakest team (Tasmania was not yet included) and {{isolated}} {{from the rest of}} Australia, so they provided an easy start for the MCC's round of state matches. The WACA Ground would not see a Test match until the 1970-71 Ashes series. George Robinson won the toss for the home side and batted. Herbert Rigg (34) and Allan Edwards (43) made their first class debuts and added 76 for the first wicket. David Watt (85) and Morgan Herbet (53) made 118 for the fifth wicket as Peter Smith (4/132) and Doug Wright (4/55) trundled their way through the batting order. Bill Voce (2/75) picked <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of late wickets and Western Australia were out for 366 on the second morning. Gibb and Washbrook opened again, but it was Jack Ikin (66) and Joe Hardstaff (53) who made the early runs, followed by Wally Hammond's 208. This was Hammond's 36th double hundred, overtaking Don Bradman's record and this early indication of good form gave the Australians some worries (Bradman retook the record in 1947-48). He added 71 with Norman Yardley (31) and 149 with Smith (46) as the MCC made 477 in 478 minutes. Due to the rain this only left 46 minutes for the WA second innings and they made a safe 48/1. 19,500 people watched the game with £1,809 in receipts.|$|E

25|$|Clayton Kershaw started August off on {{the right}} foot, {{pitching}} his fourth complete {{game of the season}} and picking up his league leading 13th win in the 6-2 road victory over the San Diego Padres. In his first start since electing not to be traded, Hiroki Kuroda was masterful, pitching seven shutout innings while striking out eight as the Dodgers beat the Padres 1-0 for Kuroda's first win since July 1. The news was not all good on the day however, as the team announced that rookie starter Rubby De La Rosa would have to undergo season ending Tommy John surgery. He was 4-5 with a 3.71 ERA for the Dodgers during his 13 appearances (10 starts). Ted Lilly allowed only one run (on a solo homer by Jason Bartlett) in six innings the next day, but it was not enough as Tim Stauffer shut the Dodgers down and the bullpen coughed <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> more runs in a 3-0 loss to the Padres. Chad Billingsley picked up his 10th win on August 5 against the Arizona Diamondbacks, 7-4. This would be the fifth straight season with double digit wins for Billingsley. The Dodgers scored six runs on seven hits in the third inning to open up the lead. Javy Guerra picked up his first four out save for his 10th of the season. On August 6, the Dodger promoted Nathan Eovaldi from the Double-A Chattanooga Lookouts to make the start against the Diamondbacks. In his Major League debut, he pitched five innings while allowing only two runs and striking out seven. The Dodgers did just enough offensively to get Eovaldi the win, 5-3. Cody Ransom hit a two-run homer in the seventh inning to help the Diamondbacks avoid a sweep and snap Clayton Kershaw's five-game winning streak.|$|E
25|$|The Golden Gophers {{would start}} {{the game with}} the ball on a chilly {{afternoon}} in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The stout Badgers defense would get right to work forcing a three–and–out. Wisconsin's first offensive play was a 49-yard run by RB James White down to the Minnesota 12-yard line. The Gopher defense would hold up and force Wisconsin to kick a 31-yard field goal by K Jack Russell. Minnesota would then punt again after only three offensive plays. Wisconsin moved the ball to about midfield but were forced to punt. The Golden Gophers took over at their own 4-yard line and picked <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of first downs but once again had to punt. The Badgers then had their own three–and–out and punting the ball back to the Gophers who took over right aroung midfield as the first quarter came to a close. On the first play of the second quarter, Minnesota QB Philip Nelson threw a 9-yard pass to WR Maxx Williams but the ball the stripped by Badgers S Nate Hammon and recovered by LB Derek Landisch at the Badgers 32-yard line. Three plays later, Wisconsin QB Joel Stave threw and interception to Gophers CB Aaron Hill who returned it 39 yards for a touchdown. Wisconsin would move the ball into Minnesota territory but were forced to punt it back to Minnesota. The Golden Gophers were putting together a nice drive but on third down and 11 from the Wisconsin 36-yard line, LB Brendan Kelly hit the Gophers QB Nelson and forced a fumble that was recovered by Badgers LB Chris Borland. Five plays later, Wisconsin was {{in the end zone}} with a 1-yard touchdown run by James White. The Badgers defense moved the Gophers offense back and forced a three–and–out. The Badgers then used a 12 play drive and got down to the Minnesota 2-yard line but were forced to kick a 20-yard field goal by Jack Russell. The Gophers would take a knee to close out the half, Wisconsin led 13–7.|$|E

500|$|By September 2015, John Paesano {{had begun}} {{composing}} {{music for the}} season. He felt that the season's new showrunners [...] "were true to {{what we were trying}} to do in season one. There were just elements in season two that we had to acknowledge" [...] such as the Punisher and Elektra. He jokingly said that [...] "it’s not like we all of the sudden went into John Williams territory, you know? It’s definitely still dark, still gritty ... but it definitely jumps <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> levels." [...] When approaching the characters of Punisher and Elektra, with whom Paesano was familiar from the comics and previous adaptations, he [...] "took all those preconceived notions I had with a grain of salt" [...] and waited to see what the season's interpretation of the characters would be. Paesano worked closely with the series' sound design team, spotting episodes with them to coordinate where [...] "we were going to hit what" [...] and [...] "maintain that definable aspect of New York" [...] and its sound. A soundtrack album for the season was released digitally by Hollywood Records on July 15, 2016.|$|E
500|$|After three years, {{production}} on Kim Possible had virtually ceased following {{the premiere of}} the film [...] because the writers felt that finally establishing Kim and Ron as a couple would serve as [...] "great wrap-up to the series", and thus had long abandoned creating new [...] "outlets" [...] for the character during the show's third season. Schooley and McCorkle had always wanted Kim and Ron to eventually end <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple,</b> but avoided this storyline {{for as long as}} possible in fear of [...] "paint [...] into a corner". When the show was surprisingly renewed for a fourth season by popular demand, Schooley and McCorkle realized that pursuing Kim and Ron's relationship provided the series with [...] "new story ideas" [...] and [...] "opportunities for comedy", and ultimately learned to appreciate the characters' [...] "new dynamic." [...] To prevent Kim and Ron's relationship from becoming [...] "soap-opera-ish", the writers strove to maintain the basics of their friendship, with Kim continuing to save the world with Ron as her sidekick. In terms of character development, the show's main titles were finally adjusted to reflect the grade in which Kim is currently enrolled, changing it from high school sophomore to high school senior. Additionally, Kim finally gets her own car, which she inherits from her father, while her younger brothers Jim and Tim begin enrollment at Middleton High School, having skipped several grades due to their genius-level intellect, much to Kim's chagrin. However, Kim eventually relents and insists that her brothers continue attending the same school as her, threatening to leave if they down.|$|E
