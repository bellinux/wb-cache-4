In 1956 the car moved back up a notch to the 5CV band when it received the bored out {{version of the same}} engine fitted {{at the back of the}} new Renault Dauphine. The connection with the Dauphine was stressed by the rebranding of the Juvaquatre Break which was now christened the Renault Dauphinoise.

40|$|Abstract. High {{temperature}} SiC devices {{require the}} materials for packaging also capable of working at higher temperature {{than those for}} Si devices. SiC devices are expected to help hybrid vehicle <b>power</b> control <b>units</b> (PCUs) <b>produce</b> higher <b>power</b> in a more compact size as SiC can withstand higher voltages and temperatures (above 300 °C) than silicon with less power loss. The improvement of interconnection technologies is increasingly becoming a top priority, particularly for the operation of SiC devices at relatively high temperatures. We propose a new interconnection method using nickel electroplating to replace Al wire bonding or die-bonding using solder materials. During {{the evaluation of the}} reliability of interconnections annealed at up to 500 °C, we observed no significant changes in mechanical or electrical properties. We found that micro-plating connections can be used successfully for high-temperature-resistant packaging for SiC devices...|$|R
50|$|The S13 {{was known}} for sharp {{steering}} and handling (thanks to front MacPherson struts and a rear multilink suspension) and relatively light weight (2700 lb) but was regarded in the automotive press as being underpowered. The engine, while durable and relatively torquey, was a heavy iron-block truck <b>unit</b> that <b>produced</b> meager <b>power</b> for its relatively large size. It was only modestly improved by the change to the DOHC version in 1991. Furthermore, despite the modest power output and relatively low vehicle weight, gas mileage was mediocre. These engines are the primary difference between the North American 240SX and the world-market Silvia/180SX/200SX. The KA24DE did not come turbocharged while the SR20DET did. The U.S. version {{was regarded as a}} highly capable sports car that only needed a better engine. Other differences include a standard limited slip differential on overseas and Canadian models, available digital climate control in Japan, and manual seat belts standard in Japan and Canada vs. automatic restraint seatbelts in America.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a simplified propeller turbine <b>unit</b> to <b>produce</b> <b>power</b> in a low head micro hydroelectric power installation. To be appropriate for remote areas and developing countries, a micro hydro system needs to be simple in design. There are good turbine designs for medium to high heads but traditional designs for heads under about 10 m, ie, the crossflow turbine and waterwheel, are slow running, requiring substantial speed increase to drive an AC generator. Propeller turbines have a higher running speed but are normally too complicated for micro hydro installations. In this thesis a suitable propeller turbine was developed. The effect of flat blades and optimum turbine blade and guide vane angles has been determined, as has the effect of various cones attached to the downstream end of the hub. The large hub diameter is an important compromise. A prototype turbine for installation on a New Zealand farm was developed from model tests. The turbine has a hub diameter to blade tip diameter ratio of 0. 66 and 8 flat blades set at 30 ° to tangential (60 ° from axial). The best efficiency of the model turbine was 62 %, with an efficiency of 57 % at the best power point. Using scaling laws it is predicted that the prototype, with a blade tip diameter of 0. 410 m, will produce 6. 0 kW at 612 RPM from a head of 2. 7 m and a flow rate of 0. 41 m³/s. This gives 4. 3 kW output from the 50 Hz 2 -pole generator. This prediction is for no cone fitted on the downstream end of the hub, but model tests indicate that the power could be improved by about 5 % {{with the addition of a}} straight sided cone on the hub...|$|R

The effect of operating conditions as solution concentrations and velocities was investigated by a sensitivity analysis.
