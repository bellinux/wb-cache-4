40|$|A {{document}} {{describes a}} low-impact mating system suitable for both docking (mating of two free-flying spacecraft) and berthing (in which a robot arm in one spacecraft positions an object for mating with either spacecraft). The low-impact mating system is fully androgynous: it mates {{with a copy}} of itself, i. e., all spacecraft and other objects to be mated are to be equipped with identical copies of the system. This aspect of the design helps to minimize the number of unique parts and to standardize and facilitate mating operations. The system includes a closed-loop feedback control subsystem that actively accommodates misalignments between mating spacecraft, thereby attenuating spacecraft dynamics and mitigating the need for precise advance positioning of the spacecraft. The operational characteristics of the mating system can be easily configured in software, during operation, to enable mating of spacecraft having various masses, center-of-gravity offsets, and closing velocities. The system design provides multi-fault tolerance for critical operations: for example, to ensure <b>unmating</b> at a critical time, a redundant unlatching mechanism and two independent pyrotechnic release subsystems are included...|$|E
40|$|Behavioral {{differentiation}} and ovarian {{development of}} <b>unmated</b> gynes, queens, and workers of Ectatomma vizottoi were investigated in laboratory conditions. Forty-one behavioral acts {{were identified and}} quantified for workers, 19 for queens and 24 for <b>unmated</b> gynes, for an overall species repertoire of 42 different behavioral acts. Ovipositing reproductive eggs was an exclusive task of the queen, whereas workers showed 15 caste-specific behaviors. The most important (frequent) behaviors for the queens were brood care, immobility, and reproduction, and for workers were immobility, grooming/interaction, brood care, and foraging. <b>Unmated</b> gynes (not winged) primarily showed immobility, brood care, grooming/interaction, and foraging. Analysis of ovarian development showed that <b>unmated</b> gynes had little-developed ovarioles, in contrast to queens. Queens and <b>unmated</b> gynes showed a clear behavioral differentiation, in which queens {{played the role of}} reproducers and <b>unmated</b> gynes performed activities belonging to the worker repertoire.

40|$|Rhytidoponera sp. 12 is a {{polygynous}} Australian arid-zone queenless ponerine ant with morphologically identical mated workers (gamergates) and <b>unmated</b> workers. Discriminating gamergates from virgin {{workers in}} R. sp. 12 is therefore difficult. All females have functional ovaries and spermatheca. The ability of <b>unmated</b> workers to lay trophic eggs {{has not been}} reported. In four R. sp. 12 colonies we found that gamergates have tough reddish-brown cuticle differing {{from that of the}} dark brown <b>unmated</b> workers. Gamergates were successfully identified by combining this observable morphological difference with previously described behavioural traits thus eliminating the need of identification through dissection. In a laboratory-kept colony gamergates showed mutual tolerance. Egg-shuffling behaviour by gamergates was observed. A high proportion of <b>unmated</b> workers laid trophic eggs that were either cannibalised or shared between nestmates; larvae were observed to feed exclusively on these trophic eggs. Eggs laid by gamergates were sometimes eaten, although the majority of these were deposited onto egg piles carried by <b>unmated</b> workers. Oophagy of viable eggs by gamergates may represent a form of dominance behaviour or, together with egg-shuffling, a behaviour to resist manipulation by less fecund gamergates. Removing gamergates from three colonies led to oocyte development in some <b>unmated</b> workers, indicating that ovarian development in virgin workers may be reduced in the presence of gamergates...|$|R
5|$|Northern mockingbirds {{are famous}} for their song repertoires. Studies have shown that males sing songs at the {{beginning}} of breeding season to attract females. <b>Unmated</b> males sing songs in more directions and sing more bouts than mated males. In addition, <b>unmated</b> males perform more flight displays than mated males. The mockingbirds usually nest several times during one breeding season. Depending on the stage of breeding and the mating status, a male mockingbird will vary his song production. The <b>unmated</b> male keeps close track of this change. He sings in one direction when he perceives a chance to lure a female from the nest of the mated male. <b>Unmated</b> males {{are also more likely to}} use elevated perches to extend his songs to a further range. Though the mockingbirds are socially monogamous, mated males have been known to sing to attract additional mates.|$|R
40|$|A {{temperature}} sensor {{has been developed}} that utilizes the temperature dependent absorption of a rare earth doped optical fiber. The temperature measurement is localized at a remote position by splicing a short section of the rare earth fiber into a loop of commercial data communication fiber that sends and returns an optical probe signal to the temperature sensitive section of fiber. The optical probe signal is generated from two different wavelength filtered LED sources. A four port fiber optic coupler combines the two separate wavelength signals into the fiber sensing loop. Time multiplexing is used so that each signal wavelength is present at a different time. A reference signal level measurement is also made from the LED sources and a ratio taken with the sensor signal to produce a transmission measurement of the fiber loop. The transmission is affected differently at each wavelength by the rare earth temperature sensitive fiber. The temperature is determined from a ratio of the two transmission measurements. This method eliminates any ambiguity with respect to changes in signal level in the fiber loop such as mating and <b>unmating</b> optical connectors. The temperature range of the sensor is limited to about 800 C by the temperature limit fo the feed fibers...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Mating {{changes the}} {{mechanism}} by which E 2 regulates oviductal egg transport, from a non-genomic to a genomic mode. Previously, we found that E 2 increased the expression of several genes in the oviduct of mated rats, but not in <b>unmated</b> rats. Among the transcripts that increased its level by E 2 only in mated rats was the one coding for an s 100 calcium binding protein G (s 100 g) whose functional role in the oviduct is unknown. Methods Herein, we investigated the participation of s 100 g on the E 2 genomic effect that accelerates oviductal transport in mated rats. Thus, we determined the effect of E 2 on the mRNA and protein level of s 100 g in the oviduct of mated and <b>unmated</b> rats. Then, we explored the effect of E 2 on egg transport in <b>unmated</b> and mated rats under conditions in which s 100 g protein was knockdown in the oviduct by a morpholino oligonucleotide against s 100 g (s 100 g-MO). In addition, the localization of s 100 g in the oviduct of mated and <b>unmated</b> rats following treatment with E 2 was also examined. Results Expression of s 100 g mRNA progressively increased at 3 - 24 h after E 2 treatment in the oviduct of mated rats while in <b>unmated</b> rats s 100 g increased only at 12 and 24 hours. Oviductal s 100 g protein increased 6 h following E 2 and continued elevated at 12 and 24 h in mated rats, whereas in <b>unmated</b> rats s 100 g protein increased {{at the same time}} points as its transcript. Administration of a morpholino oligonucleotide against s 100 g transcript blocked the effect of E 2 on egg transport in mated, but not in <b>unmated</b> rats. Finally, immunoreactivity of s 100 g was observed only in epithelial cells of the oviducts of mated and <b>unmated</b> rats and it was unchanged after E 2 treatment. Conclusions Mating affects the kinetic of E 2 -induced expression of s 100 g although it not changed the cellular localization of s 100 g in the oviduct after E 2. On the other hand, s 100 g is a functional component of E 2 genomic effect that accelerates egg transport. These findings show a physiological involvement of s 100 g in the rat oviduct. </p...|$|R
40|$|Estradiol (E 2) accelerates oviductal egg {{transport}} through intraoviductal non-genomic pathways in <b>unmated</b> {{rats and}} through genomic pathways in mated rats. This shift in pathways {{has been designated}} as intracellular path shifting (IPS), and represents a novel and hitherto unrecognized effect of mating on the female reproductive tract. We had reported previously that IPS involves shutting down the E 2 non-genomic pathway up- and downstream of 2 -methoxyestradiol. Here, we evaluated whether IPS involves changes in the genomic pathway too. Using microarray analysis, we found that a common group of genes changed its expression in response to E 2 in <b>unmated</b> and mated rats, indicating that an E 2 genomic signaling pathway is present before and after mating; however, a group of genes decreased its expression only in mated rats and another group of genes increased its expression only in <b>unmated</b> rats. We evaluated the possibility that this difference {{is a consequence of}} an E 2 non-genomic signaling pathway present in <b>unmated</b> rats, but not in mated rats. Mating shuts down this E 2 non-genomic signaling pathway up- and downstream of cAMP production. The Star level is increased by E 2 in <b>unmated</b> rats, but not in mated rats. This is blocked by the antagonist of estrogen receptor ICI 182 780, the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor SQ 22536, and the catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor, OR 486. These results indicate that the E 2 -induced gene expression profile in the rat oviduct differs before and after mating, and this difference is probably mediated by an E 2 non-genomic signaling pathway operating on gene expression only in <b>unmated</b> rats.

40|$|This {{study on}} the nightingale, Luscinia megarhynchos, {{is the first to}} examine both nocturnal and diurnal singing {{activity}} of mated and <b>unmated</b> males throughout a species' entire breeding cycle. Nocturnal song was sung mostly by <b>unmated</b> males. After pair formation, males ceased nocturnal singing and resumed it if their mate deserted. These results strongly suggest that nocturnal song of <b>unmated</b> males functions to attract a mate. Diurnal singing activity before females settled was low and did not predict future mating status. However, <b>unmated</b> males showed a continuous increase in diurnal singing activity {{until the end of the}} breeding cycle, but diurnal singing activity of mated males decreased after the egg-laying period. Mated males resumed nocturnal song for, on average, 3 nights during egg laying by their mates. This second period of nocturnal song coincided with the peak of diurnal singing activity. Such a high male singing effort during egg laying might allow the female to adjust her reproductive effort to male quality, deter rival males (e. g. through honest announcement of the female's fertility) or attract females for extrapair copulations.

40|$|Sexually {{selected}} infanticide, whereby <b>unmated</b> males {{obtain a}} mate by killing the dependent offspring of an already mated female, {{is a common}} alternative reproductive strategy in many animals. I estimated the frequency of infanticide in a population of barn swallows, Hirundo rustica, during the period 1977 [...] 2002. Population size decreased {{by more than a}} factor 10 during this period, and this decrease was associated with an increase in mortality, selecting for adults with better body condition. Density-dependent effects acted on infanticide through the relationship between the relative number of <b>unmated</b> males and population size. Because males in prime condition are better able to defend their nests against infanticidal males, the frequency of infanticide decreased as mean tail length and mean body condition of males increased during the study period. Therefore, a rapid decrease in population size, a decrease in the abundance of <b>unmated</b> males, and a concomitant increase in body condition have changed the importance of infanticide from being a major cause of mortality accounting for more than 25 % of all nestling mortality to being almost completely absent during a period of 25 years.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{northern}} {{fowl mite}} (NFM; Ornithonyssus sylviarum) is a blood-feeding ectoparasite of birds and a major pest of poultry in the United States. Mite populations spread rapidly in commercial flocks, reach peak burdens of > 70, 000 mites per bird and have developed resistance to many pesticides. Despite decades as a pest in the United States, the reproductive biology of NFM remains unclear. Based on karyotypes, the NFM has haplodiploid sex determination, which suggests <b>unmated</b> females could produce male offspring (arrhenotoky). Thus, <b>unmated</b> females could disseminate to a new host and initiate an infestation by producing and mating with sons (oedipal mating). Methods We used small capsules to isolate and recover NFM on host chickens. Mites in capsules could blood feed, develop and reproduce, but could not contact other mites. Individual larvae were matured in isolation to produce known, <b>unmated</b> females. We evaluated reproduction of (I) previously mated females (i) in isolation, or (ii) paired with a male, and (II) <b>unmated</b> (virgin) females in isolation. In each treatment we recorded the number and sexes of offspring produced over time. Results Mated NFM produced female and male offspring in isolation, or when paired with a male. When paired with a male, females produced a female-biased sex ratio of the offspring (F:M ratio ~ 5 : 1). <b>Unmated,</b> female NFM produced exclusively male offspring when in isolation. When paired with their sons that had developed to maturity, the "virgin" females were able to mate and subsequently produce female offspring. Conclusions This study found that females with immediate access to sperm produced mostly female offspring. Virgin female NFM initially produced only male offspring and subsequently used oedipal mating to produce female offspring. Using this reproductive system NFM could successfully colonize new hosts as immature, or <b>unmated</b> females. The strong female-biased sex ratio of NFM populations suggests {{a large proportion of}} the parasite population is capable of disseminating to new hosts, which is essential for an obligate parasite to persist. </p...|$|R
50|$|A saccular {{dilation}} in the spermatheca stores spermatozoa {{received from}} males during copulation. It can maximize efficiency {{and use of}} sperm. Derived from the ectoderm, the spermatheca is covered in fat and tissue and has three main regions: the distal region, the medial region and the proximal region. The coiled distal region {{is responsible for the}} control of sperm flow. It can modulate how much sperm is excreted which ensures that the female does not lose an excess of sperm. The proximal region contains valves which prevent the backflow of sperm when muscles dilate. This region is connected to the spermathecal duct where sperm exits. Stacconi and Romani (2011) found that, overall, the saccular structure within the spermatheca {{plays a key role in}} identifying mated and <b>unmated</b> females.
