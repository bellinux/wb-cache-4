40|$|In {{this article}} we propose a method close to Double Chain Ladder (DCL) {{introduced}} by Martínez-Miranda, Nielsen, and Verrall (2012 a). The proposed method is motivated by the potential lack of stability of the DCL method (and of the classical Chain ladder method [CLM] itself). We consider the implicit estimation of the <b>underwriting</b> <b>year</b> inflation in the CLM method and the explicit estimation of it in DCL. This may represent a weak point for DCL and CLM because the <b>underwriting</b> <b>year</b> inflation might be estimated with significant uncertainty. A key feature of the new method is that the <b>underwriting</b> <b>year</b> inflation can be estimated from the less volatile incurred data and then transferred into the DCL model. We include an empirical illustration that illustrates {{the differences between the}} estimates of the IBNR and RBNS cash flows from DCL and the new method. We also apply bootstrap estimation to approximate the predictive distributions...|$|E
40|$|It {{has long}} been known that maximum {{likelihood}} estimation in a Poisson model reproduces the chain-ladder technique. We revisit this model. A new canonical parametrisation is proposed to circumvent the inherent identification problem in the parametrisation. The maximum likelihood estimators for the canonical parameter are simple, interpretable and easy to derive. The boundary problem where all observations in one particular development year or on particular <b>underwriting</b> <b>year</b> is zero is also analysed...|$|E
40|$|Double chain ladder {{demonstrated}} how the classical chain ladder technique {{can be broken}} down into separate components. It was shown that under certain model assumptions and via one particular estimation technique, it is possible to interpret the classical chain ladder method as a model of the observed number of counts with a built-in delay function from when a claim is reported until it is paid. In this paper, we investigate the double chain ladder model further and consider the case when other knowledge is available, focusing on two specific types of prior knowledge, namely prior knowledge on the number of zero-claims for each <b>underwriting</b> <b>year</b> and prior knowledge about the relationship between the development of the claim and its mean severity. Both types of prior knowledge readily lend themselves {{to be included in the}} double chain ladder framework...|$|E
2500|$|Arising {{simultaneously}} with these developments were wider issues: first, in the United States, an ever-widening interpretation {{by the courts}} of insurance coverage in relation to workers' compensation for asbestosis-related losses, which created a huge hole in Lloyd's claims reserves, which was initially not recognised and then not acknowledged. Second, {{by the end of}} the decade, almost all of the market agreements, such as the Joint Hull Agreement, which were effectively cartels mandating minimum terms, had been abandoned under pressure of competition. Third, new specialised policies had arisen which had the effect of concentrating risk: these included [...] "run-off" [...] policies, under which the liability of previous <b>underwriting</b> <b>years</b> would be transferred to the current year, and [...] "time and distance" [...] policies, whereby reserves would be used to buy a guarantee of future income.|$|R
40|$|Underwriting Performance Key: Fitch Ratings regards {{continued}} underwriting discipline by Lloyd‟s of London as important. We expect Lloyds ‟ future cross-cycle underwriting profitability {{to be more}} favourable than historically, {{due in part to}} {{the work}} undertaken by the Performance Management Directorate (PMD). The agency has increased confidence that prior <b>underwriting</b> <b>years</b> will develop favourably on aggregate across the rating horizon. Fitch forecasts a sub- 95 % calendar-year combined ratio for 2013, subject to normal catastrophe experience. PMD’s Market Oversight Positive: Fitch considers the increased oversight of market participants provided by the PMD to have played a key role in the reduction in cross-cycle earnings volatility since it was established in 2003. Processes including business plan reviews and syndicate benchmarking have helped PMD and syndicates improve key aspects of underwriting, including pricing, reserving, claims management, risk-adjusted capital setting and catastrophe modelling techniques. Favourable Performance Versus Peers: Lloyds ‟ has achieved marginally reduced cross-cycle earnings volatility in the context of the wider industry, both in absolute terms and when compared with peers...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we explore the theory to {{selecting}} risk capital enhancing securities in insurance companies underwriting catastrophe (cat) exposures, under the constraints of regulatory and economic capital adequacy requirements. The approach used provides a number of insights about the selection and optimisation of risk capital decisions. For example, we find that instruments are selected in the preceding period, but securities structure is optimised in the <b>underwriting</b> <b>year.</b> Using a real options approach, we find that insurers optimise their securities structure if they manage to survive a cat-event and have enough capital from existing structures or access to additional capital to undertake investments in post-loss growth opportunities. We also find that, emerging alternative risk capital solutions are designed to reduce wealth transfer effects, information asymmetry costs and moral hazard associated with cat exposures. This {{is consistent with the}} implications of the information asymmetry hypothesis...|$|E
40|$|Characteristic of many reserving methods {{designed}} to analyse claims data aggregated by contract or sets of contracts, {{is the assumption}} that features typifying historical data are representative of the underwritten risk and of future losses likely to affect the contracts. Kremer (1982), Bomheutter and Ferguson (1972), de Alba (2002), and many others, consider models with development patterns common to all underwriting years and known mean-variance relationships. Data amenable to such assumptions are indeed rare. More usual are large variations in settlement speeds, exposure and claim volumes. Also typifying many published models are Incurred But Not Reported (IBNR) predictions limited to periods with known claims, frequently adjusted with "tail factors " generated from market statistics. Of concern could be analytical approach inconsistencies behind reserves for delay periods before and after the last known claims, under reserving and unfair reserve allocation at <b>underwriting</b> <b>year,</b> array or contract levels. As applications of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, the models proposed in this paper depart from the neat assumptions of quasi-likelihood and extended quasi-likelihood, and introduce random effects models. The primary focus is the close dependency of the 1 BNR on data variability structures and variance models, built with reference to the generic model derived in Vera (2003). The models have been implemented in BUG...|$|E

40|$|The National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation (NACCHO) {{welcomes the}} Rudd Governments {{commitment}} {{to build a}} better primary health care system for all Australians through the development of Australia's first National Primary Health Care Strategy. In this submission we provide an important Introduction which sets the context and the definitions that underpin the recommendations for a national primary health care strategy that can best close the gap in life expectancy and health outcomes for Aboriginal peoples. The National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation believes that the success of a primary health care system should be judged by how effectively, those who are most needy are able to access quality care. The matter is not just about access per se, but also about who is accessing the health system. A strategy that supports health service provision to those who are already good users of the health system will not make gains in health outcomes for Aboriginal peoples. Access to primary health care is identified as a core obligation under the International Covenant for Economic Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). Within this core obligation is the understanding that Indigenous peoples have a right to design, deliver and control health services for them in order to achieve health gains. To this end, Australian Governments and non-government institutions have supported Aboriginal primary health care through Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services (ACCHSs). The Rudd Governments definition of partnership means involving: "Indigenous people in the design and delivery of programs locally and regionally, and share responsibility for outcomes… This strategy is firmly based on the principle of working in partnership with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community-controlled health sector. " The primary health care delivered by Aboriginal community-controlled health services is culturally appropriate because they are: 'An incorporated Aboriginal organisation, initiated by a local Aboriginal community, based in a local Aboriginal community, governed by an Aboriginal body which is elected by the local Aboriginal community, delivering a holistic and culturally appropriate health service to the community which controls it Services that are not Aboriginal community-controlled, by definition, cannot deliver culturally appropriate primary health care. However, services that are not Aboriginal community-controlled can be encouraged to deliver healthcare that is culturally secure. A definition and program prepared by the ACCHS sector for the delivery of Aboriginal cultural safety training for mainstream health services should be supported. NACCHO wishes to impart the message that the Strategy affirm the critical role and impact that accessible and culturally appropriate primary health care can make to close the gap in Aboriginal health standards by 2018 (Rudd Governments Statement of Intent), and for the Strategy to support the required actions needed to realise that objective. In this regard, NACCHO provides numerous recommendations under each of the 10 elements of the Discussion Paper: Towards a National Primary Health Care Strategy. Principal of these recommendations is that ACCHSs are the preferred service model in the delivery of comprehensive primary health care to Aboriginal peoples across Australia. Unless ACCHSs are supported as the key providers in a strategy to close the gap, through an appropriately resourced Capacity Building Plan, the disparities in Aboriginal people's health status will not be alleviated. A systematic framework for working towards a primary health care system for Aboriginal peoples that maximises local community control (such as through a national plan aligned with the Northern Territory Aboriginal Health Forum 'Pathways to Community Control' 1) should <b>underwrite</b> a 5 <b>year</b> Capacity Building Plan for ACCHSs. Resourcing pathways to community control for primary health care services will require pooling of all Aboriginal–specific primary health care funds currently being directed to State Governments, Divisions of General Practice and other private health care providers. This will maximize the potential of primary health care to close the gap in life expectancy for Aboriginal peoples. Such fund pooling should be governed by an appropriate mechanism, requiring the involvement of, and endorsement by, the NACCHO Aboriginal leadership. Capacity building will require capital and recurrent funding and workforce strategies to train, recruit and retain staff including measures to address the vast salary disparities which currently prevent staff recruitment within ACCHSs. It will require resourcing based on the model of the Primary Health Care Access Program (PHCAP). A systematic approach towards defining the core deliverables for Aboriginal primary health care services (ie what funding would buy with an acceptable per capita benchmark funding allocation) is needed. ACCHSs funding should be based on a weighted population basis, according to need. A resource allocation formula that reflects the actual cost of ACCHSs providing the agreed core services at particular locations must be agreed to by NACCHO and Affiliates. Progressing such a Plan will require a formalised partnership between the Department of Health and Ageing and the NACCHO leadership, particularly {{in the form of a}} new National Framework Agreement. The expert advisory group is encouraged to read the full evidence-based NACCHO submission, but in summary, we draw attention to the following core requirements in order to expand ACCHSs: 1. A long-term plan of action for the expansion of ACCHSs developed in partnership between the Department of Health and Ageing and NACCHO and Affiliates (see Element 1), which meets specified targets and is measured by the indicators identified at the National Indigenous Health Equality Summit (2008) (Element 5). 2. Joint governance of an expansion program based on a National Framework Agreement (see Element 3). 3. The plan to support the adoption of core functions for ACCHSs across Australia (see Elements 2 & 10). 4. A workforce support program (see Elements 2, 8 & 9). 5. An evidence-based, ethical and acceptable quality assurance and performance management program developed by ACCHSs and for ACCHSs (see Elements 5 & 6) 6. A funding base for ACCHSs that utilises: • funding on a weighted population basis according to need • pooling of all Aboriginal-specific primary health care funds (including those to State Governments, Divisions of General Practice and other private providers).
