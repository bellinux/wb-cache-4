5|$|Megabat species {{often have}} {{eyesight}} as good as, {{if not better}} than, human vision. Their eyesight, <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> their microbat relatives, is adapted to both night and daylight vision including some colour vision.|$|E
5|$|Sigurd {{was in the}} {{fortunate}} position that on his accession to the earldom there {{seem to have been}} no other serious contenders. In this respect his rule was <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the earlier generation of the sons of Earl Thorfinn and of the next generation in that it avoided the bitter feuding that beset the earldom during both of those periods.|$|E
5|$|The Zong {{massacre}} {{has inspired}} several works of literature. Fred D'Aguiar's novel Feeding the Ghosts (1997) {{tells the story}} of an African who survives being thrown overboard from the Zong. In the novel, the journal of the slave—Mintah—is lost, <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Granville Sharp. According to the cultural historian Anita Rupprecht, this signifies the silencing of African voices about the massacre.|$|E
50|$|The Millena race {{reside in}} Millena Town and its {{surrounding}} areas, <b>unlike</b> Rain <b>that</b> consists <b>of</b> mountainous regions Millena is surrounded by vast jungles such as Twinible Forest, Forest of Destiny and the Plains of Memory.|$|R
60|$|The châtelain {{was again}} surprised; for the {{steadiness}} of the reply denoted innocence, and {{he studied the}} countenance of the prisoner intently. He found apparent frankness where he had expected to meet with subterfuge, and, like all who have great acquaintance with crime, his distrust increased. The simplicity of one who really had nothing to conceal, <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> appearance <b>of</b> firmness, which is assumed to affect innocence, set his shrewdness at fault, though familiar with most of he expedients of the guilty.|$|R
50|$|As {{with the}} better-known Interactive Fiction Competition, works {{submitted}} to the Spring Thing must be released as freeware or public domain. <b>Unlike</b> <b>that</b> competition's limit <b>of</b> two hours per work, judges may {{spend as much time}} as necessary with an entry in the Spring Thing. The authors need to submit a small fee to enter.|$|R
5|$|Butterfly larvae, caterpillars, {{have a hard}} (sclerotised) {{head with}} strong mandibles used for cutting their food, most often leaves. They have {{cylindrical}} bodies, with ten segments to the abdomen, generally with short prolegs on segments 3–6 and 10; the three pairs of true legs on the thorax have five segments each. Many are well camouflaged; others are aposematic with bright colours and bristly projections containing toxic chemicals obtained from their food plants. The pupa or chrysalis, <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> moths, is not wrapped in a cocoon.|$|E
5|$|Common ravens have a {{wide range}} of vocalizations which are of {{interest}} to ornithologists. Gwinner carried out important studies in the early 1960s, recording and photographing his findings in great detail. Fifteen to 30 categories of vocalization have been recorded for this species, most of which are used for social interaction. Calls recorded include alarm calls, chase calls, and flight calls. The species has a distinctive, deep, resonant prruk-prruk-prruk call, which to experienced listeners is <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> any other corvid. Its very wide and complex vocabulary includes a high, knocking toc-toc-toc, a dry, grating kraa, a low guttural rattle and some calls of an almost musical nature.|$|E
5|$|Feeding {{mainly on}} bony fishes, the viper dogfish captures prey by {{protruding}} its jaws and impaling them with its teeth. Its impressive gape {{allows it to}} swallow relatively large fish whole. The skeletal and muscular structure of its head shows unique features that support this feeding mechanism, which is <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> other dogfish sharks. This shark gives birth to live young, which are nourished by yolk during gestation; the litter size is probably fewer than 26 pups. Small numbers of viper dogfish are caught incidentally in purse seines and bottom trawls. The IUCN presently lacks sufficient data to assess the conservation status of this species.|$|E
50|$|There was no Elder Futhark rune for the phoneme, so <b>that</b> <b>unlike</b> those <b>of</b> most Gothic letters, {{the name}} does not {{continue}} {{the name of}} a rune (but see qairþra).|$|R

5|$|He {{was found}} guilty and punished posthumously for the crime of treason. The Senate had his {{property}} proscribed, forbade mourning on his account, removed images of his likeness, such as statues and portraits, and his name was erased {{from the base of}} one statue in particular as part of his damnatio memoriae. Yet, in a show of clemency not <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the emperor, the Senate had Piso's property returned and divided equally between his two sons, on condition that his daughter Calpurnia be given 1,000,000 sesterces as dowry and a further 4,000,000 as personal property. His wife Placina was absolved.|$|E
5|$|Her {{education}} was extremely limited. She {{was able to}} attend a Congregationalist Sunday school where she learned to read and write. Congregationalist doctrine, <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the Church of England at the time, emphasised {{the importance of education}} for the poor. Her prized possession was a bound volume of the Dissenters' Theological Magazine and Review, in which the family's pastor, the Reverend James Wheaton, had published two essays, one insisting that God had created the world in six days, the other urging dissenters to study the new science of geology.|$|E
5|$|Like the House of the Lake, most {{houses in}} the crowded Theatre Quarter of Delos have irregular-shaped floor plans (such as {{trapezoidal}} designs), as opposed to square or rectangular designs. The narrow and irregular street grid is <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> other quarters, where streets usually meet at approximately right angles. Similar {{to the majority of}} excavated homes of Delos, those in the Theatre Quarter feature an open courtyard without porticoes, instead of the peristyle layout with columns. Some of the {{houses in the}} Theatre Quarter lack interior decoration altogether, with neither wall murals nor mosaics, which is unusual for most Delian homes.|$|E

40|$|Creating rankings {{might seem}} like a vain {{exercise}} in belly-button gazing, even more so for people so <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> kind <b>of</b> things as programmers. However, {{in this paper we}} will try to prove how creating city (or province) based rankings in Spain has led to all kind of interesting effects, including increased productivity and community building. We describe the methodology we have used to search for programmers residing in a particular province focusing on those where most population is concentrated and apply different measures to show how these communities differ in structure, number and productivity.

5000|$|Initial {{response}} to Pemberley’s Emma character was mixed {{due to her}} tendency toward [...] "unlikable" [...] self-confidence and large ego, though the first two episodes garnered over 120,000 views in the show’s first week. By early January (three months into the series), Emma had won over her audience with her caring for those around her. Emma Approved’s viewership was only about 80% <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Pemberley’s predecessor series The Lizzie Bennet Diaries, but <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> series, all <b>of</b> Emma’s transmedia storytelling was monetized using brand integration including companies such as Modcloth and Samsung.|$|R
5|$|Sherlock Holmes Baffled is a {{very short}} American silent film created in 1900 with {{cinematography}} by Arthur Marvin. It is the earliest known film to feature Arthur Conan Doyle's detective character Sherlock Holmes, albeit in a form <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> later screen incarnations. The inclusion of the character also makes it the first recorded detective film. In the film, a thief who can appear and disappear at will steals a sack of items from Sherlock Holmes. At each point, Holmes's attempts to thwart the intruder end in failure.|$|E
5|$|The adult sarus crane is {{very large}} with grey wings and body; a bare red head {{and part of}} the upper neck; a greyish crown; and a long greenish-grey pointed bill. In flight, the long neck is held straight, <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> an heron, which folds it back, and the black wing tips can be seen; the crane's long pink legs trail behind them. This bird has a grey ear covert patch, an orange-red iris and a greenish-grey bill. Juveniles have a {{yellowish}} base to the bill and the brown-grey head is fully feathered.|$|E
5|$|The {{systemic}} {{heart has}} muscular contractile walls {{and consists of}} a single ventricle and two atria, one for {{each side of the}} body. The blood vessels consist of arteries, capillaries and veins and are lined with a cellular endothelium which is quite <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> most other invertebrates. The blood circulates through the aorta and capillary system, to the vena cavae, after which the blood is pumped through the gills by the auxiliary hearts and back to the main heart. Much of the venous system is contractile, which helps circulate the blood.|$|E

500|$|Similarly, The Hollywood Reporter noted <b>that,</b> <b>unlike</b> some <b>of</b> {{the other}} films {{released}}, Silence {{was playing in}} fewer cinemas and had been released {{at a time when}} the marketplace had [...] "too many adult dramas" [...] and [...] "a lack of interest in the subject matter".|$|R

[...] Nicoll also posited that the inspiration for the character of Hilary involved [...] "naked Martian princesses and well-known consulting detectives." ...|$|R
5|$|Though {{a myriad}} of bones was {{available}} by 1969, many important ones were missing or hard to interpret. There were few postorbital skull elements, no femurs, no sacrum, no furcula or sternum, missing vertebrae, and (Ostrom thought) only a tiny fragment of a coracoid. Ostrom's skeletal reconstruction of Deinonychus included a very unusual pelvic bone– a pubis that was trapezoidal and flat, <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> other theropods, but which was the same length as the ischium and which was found right next to it.|$|E
5|$|<b>Unlike</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> his contemporary, the Finn Jean Sibelius, Nielsen's {{reputation}} abroad did {{not start}} to evolve until after World War II. For some time, international interest was largely directed towards his symphonies while his other works, many of them highly popular in Denmark, have only recently started {{to become part of}} the world repertoire. Even in Denmark, many of his compositions failed to impress. It was only in 1897 after the first performance of Hymnus amoris that he received support from the critics, to be substantially reinforced in 1906 by their enthusiastic reception of Masquerade.|$|E
5|$|Following its predecessors, Brawl uses {{a battle}} system <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> typical {{fighting}} games. Players {{can choose from}} a large selection of characters, each attempting to knock their opponents off the screen as they fight on various stages. The characters in Brawl include most of the same ones as the predecessors, such as the well-known Mario and Pikachu. Instead of using traditional health bars that start at a maximum value and lose value, Brawl characters start the game with 0%; the value rises as they take damage and may rise over 100% {{to a maximum of}} 999%. As a character's percentage increases, the character flies further back when hit. When a character is knocked beyond a stage's boundary and disappears from the screen, the character loses either a life, a point, or coins, depending on the mode of play. Brawl includes a function which allows players to create profiles with personalized button configurations for each control method along with their chosen username.|$|E
50|$|A debutante {{chosen by}} Allan Dwan, Collyer {{had her first}} {{starring}} role in 1927 when she starred in East Side, West Side. She did a total of eleven films during the silent film era, and <b>unlike</b> many <b>of</b> <b>that</b> period she made a successful transition to sound movies.|$|R
60|$|There {{are times}} of affliction, when {{the human soul}} fails to find relief in tears or cries. Poor Jack Matterby stood for some time motionless, as if paralysed, with glaring eyes and a face not <b>unlike</b> to <b>that</b> <b>of</b> death. They sought to rouse him, {{but he could not}} speak. Suddenly, observing the front door open, he darted out into the street, and ran {{straight}} home, where he flung himself on his mother's bed, and burst into an uncontrollable flood of tears. By degrees the passion subsided, leaving only a stunned feeling behind, under the influence of which he lay perfectly still.|$|R

5|$|Mycena mustea {{is similar}} to the North American species M.umbrinovinosa, which is {{distinguished}} by having a vinaceous-brown to purplish-black cap, irregularly shaped cheilocystidia that are covered at their tips with long, flexuous excrescences, and clamp connections. Mycena mustea is also similar to the European species M.urania, which differs in its blackish-violet cap, broadly club-shaped cheilocystidia covered with numerous, evenly spaced warts, and clamp connections. Mycena mustea also resembles the Japanese M.fonticola, a species described concurrently with M.mustea. <b>Unlike</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> M.fonticola, the cap of M.mustea typically becomes pale grayish-purple when mature; the cheilocystidia have several short finger-like excrescences at their tips; and the stem cuticle is made up of smooth hyphae. In contrast, the cap of M.fonticola becomes dark violet-brown when mature; there are no excrescences on the cheilocystidia; and the hyphae of the stem cuticle are sparsely covered with diverticulae that resemble warts or fingers.|$|E
5|$|The Smuts {{family lived}} in an almost {{exclusively}} Afrikaner world. Nevertheless, this cultural identity, <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the Boer republics to the north, did not define itself on opposition to Britain or the British. Swartland farmers had been largely insulated from the causes of discontent of earlier years, discontent which eventually culminated in the mass Boer migrations of the Great Trek. As a result, Jacobus Smuts largely unmoved by the Afrikaner nationalism preached by such organisations as the Afrikaner Bond, founded by Rev. SJ du Toit in 1877. After 1884, having come {{under the leadership of}} Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr, the Bond became more to the Smuts' taste. Hofmeyr changed the fundamental basis of the organisation, from one preaching Afrikaner separatism to one which combined a pragmatic policy of economic protectionism for Cape farmers and their produce with a call for unity between the English and Dutch-speaking populations and cooperation with the Colonial authorities. As a member of the Cape legislature Jacobus Smuts pledged his support to Hofmeyr and the reformed Bond.|$|E
5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} {{is the most}} social of the Carnivora in that it has the largest group sizes and most complex social behaviours. Its social {{organisation}} is <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> any other carnivore, bearing closer resemblance to that of cercopithecine primates (baboons and macaques) with respect to group-size, hierarchical structure, and frequency of social interaction among both kin and unrelated group-mates. However, the social system of the spotted hyena is openly competitive rather than cooperative, with access to kills, mating opportunities {{and the time of}} dispersal for males depending on the ability to dominate other clan-members. Females provide only for their own cubs rather than assist each other, and males display no paternal care. Spotted hyena society is matriarchal; females are larger than males, and dominate them.|$|E
