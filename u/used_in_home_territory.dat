30|$|Critics {{of using}} TEK for {{conservation}} purposes often {{are concerned about}} the validity of local knowledge derived from stories, songs, artwork, and religious practices and its translation into information useful to scientists and protected area managers (Berkes 1999). Furthermore, as Kaschula et al. (2005) observed in their research on rural fuelwood harvest, TEK and community-based resource management practices do not easily fit into categories designated and deemed important by western science. Validity assessments based on a western science rubric may gloss over important subtleties in local knowledge and practice or completely miss other aspects such as intentionality. Misconceptions about local TEK and practice intentionality feed into conflicts over TEK use stemming from power struggles between western science and traditional science practitioners. “Western experts and aboriginal experts … have different political agendas and … relate in different ways to the resource in question” (Berkes 1999 : 11). Berkes (1999) references an ongoing argument between those who want to preserve nature apart from human <b>use</b> <b>in</b> protected parks and reserves and those who restrict personal use of a natural resource in order to ensure its future <b>use</b> <b>in</b> their <b>home</b> <b>territories.</b> Unfortunately, this division influences how government and non-governmental organizations interact with local communities and results in policies that prevent residents from accessing necessary resources. Socioeconomic and TEK studies of anthropogenic fire in contemporary indigenous African, Australian, and South American communities highlight the use of controlled burns to expand or maintain subsistence livelihood activities and resources, and reduce wildfires (Kepe and Scoones 1999, Yibarbuk et al. 2001, Kull 2002, Laris 2002, Kepe 2005, Mistry et al. 2005, Sheuyange et al. 2005). This intentionality of purpose suggests that despite their different worldviews, indigenous and western fire experts share a common goal in maintaining and fostering biodiversity.|$|R
