5|$|<b>Understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> Sun is {{expected}} to continue to evolve required an understanding of the source of its power. Arthur Stanley Eddington's confirmation of Albert Einstein's theory of relativity led to his realisation that the Sun's energy comes from nuclear fusion reactions in its core, fusing hydrogen into helium. In 1935, Eddington went further and suggested that other elements also might form within stars. Fred Hoyle elaborated on this premise by arguing that evolved stars called red giants created many elements heavier than hydrogen and helium in their cores. When a red giant finally casts off its outer layers, these elements would then be recycled to form other star systems.|$|E

40|$|Examining post- 1970 {{representations}} of the Holocaust and Nazism along with critical responses to these representations, <b>the</b> dissertation demonstrates <b>how</b> a use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> term "fascination" has shaped contemporary <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> Holocaust should {{and should not be}} represented and remembered. My argument is that despite its pervasive and influential usage in the discourse of Holocaust representation, no critical attention has been given to what the term means. In as much as the term's usage draws the historical and ethical boundaries across which {{representations of}} the Holocaust cannot pass, this dearth of critical attention given to the term means that these boundaries are not clearly defined. This dissertation gives definition and context {{to the use of the}} term "fascination" in three representative thinkers from the post-Holocaust epoch: Susan Sontag in the 1970 s; Saul Friedlander in the 1980 s; and Dominick LaCapra in the 1990 s and 2000 s. By focusing on their use of "fascination," I trace the historical and aesthetic development of {{representations of the}} Holocaust and the critical discourses that develop around them. I contend that, contra the <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> "fascination" demonstrated by Sontag, Friedlander, and LaCapra, the term may in fact designate ethically responsible modes of engagement with the art and literature of the Holocaust.

500|$|To resolve {{questions}} about the blades, Pistorius was asked {{to take part in}} a series of scientific tests in November 2007 at the German Sport University Cologne with Professor of Biomechanics Peter Brüggemann and IAAF technical expert Elio Locatelli. After two days of tests, Brüggemann reported that Pistorius used about 25 percent less energy expenditure than non-disabled athletes once he achieved a given speed. The study also found that he showed major differences in sprint mechanics, with significantly different maximum vertical ground return forces, and that the positive work or returned energy was close to three times higher than that of a human ankle. The energy loss in the blade during stance phase when the foot was on the ground was measured as 9.3 percent, while that of normal ankle joint was measured at 42.4 percent, showing a difference of more than 30 percent. Brüggemann's analysis stated that the blades allowed lower energy consumption at the same speed, and that the energy loss in the blade is significantly less than in a human ankle at maximum speed. In December of that year, Brüggemann stated to Die Welt newspaper that Pistorius [...] "has considerable advantages over athletes without prosthetic limbs who were tested by us. It was more than just a few percentage points. I did not expect it to be so clear." [...] The study was published in 2008 in Sports Technology, but later researchers stated that the analysis [...] "did not take enough variables into consideration". Commentators have also argued that the IAAF study did not accurately determine whether Cheetahs confer a net advantage because measuring the net advantage or disadvantage conferred on an athlete using Cheetahs is not possible given current scientific knowledge. Second, the IAAF study may not have measured Pistorius’s performance against appropriate controls. IAAF used five non-disabled athletes, who run 400-meter races in similar times to Pistorius, as controls. However, because Pistorius was relatively new to the sport of running, he may not have trained enough to maximize his physical potential and reach his peak performance when the IAAF study was conducted. In March 2007, approximately 9 months before the IAAF study was conducted, Pistorius’s coach commented that Pistorius had not trained enough to achieve an upper body commensurate with the upper bodies of most elite sprinters. To obtain the most accurate <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> prostheses affect Pistorius’s performance, he should be compared to athletes with similar physical potential. Consequently, the IAAF study may have been flawed because it compared Pistorius, who might have the physical potential to run faster than his current times, against athletes at their peak.|$|E
