50|$|Acquisitions: When {{an object}} {{arrives at the}} museum {{for the first time}} as a {{prospective}} addition to the collection, a registrar immediately begins the documentation and tracking process by assigning a temporary identification number and assembling records that include the object's condition, date of arrival, the reason for its arrival at the museum, and a photograph documenting its physical appearance. This information follows the object through the acquisition process, tracking its movements. If the museum decides to accept the object, the registrar will then <b>update</b> <b>the</b> <b>record,</b> assigning a permanent accession number to the object. The registrar also makes recommendations to the Collections Committee. Using the museum's Collections Management Policy, the registrar assesses whether or not the object fits the collection, determines whether the museum has the necessary resources to properly care for the object, and ascertains that provenance can be established to protect the museum from potential litigation.|$|E
3000|$|Update(SK,x,v_x^'): To <b>update</b> <b>the</b> <b>record</b> of index x, {{the client}} firstly {{retrieves}} the current record v_x from the server. That is, the client obtains σ←Query(PK,S,x) from the server and checks that Verify(PK,x,σ [...])=v_x [...]. Then the client computes (C',U) ←VC.Update_PP(C,v_x,x,v_x') and outputs PK'=(PP,C') and t_x'=(PK',v_x',U). Finally, the server uses v_x' {{to update the}} database record of index x, PK' to update the public key, and U to update the auxiliary information.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} analysis {{undertaken by}} UNSW Library for assigning Digital Object Identifiers to grey literature. As a ‘trusted identifier’, DOIs assist tracking and relating research artefacts, but their assignment carries responsibilities that affect workflow options. Factors {{to be considered}} include the scope of repositories and resource types, request and minting mechanisms, DOI display within landing pages and files, and restrictions on items assigned a DOI. This paper includes an environmental scan of relevant international DOI services for grey literature and outlines a model whereby requests are reviewed and actioned by Library staff. The service is provided through a web application that allows students or staff to submit DOI requests for grey literature deposited in a UNSW repository. Library staff are then able to review the submission, mint a DOI, and <b>update</b> <b>the</b> <b>record.</b> In addition, trusted partners within the institution have access to Mint functionality. The submission process makes the user aware of DOI conditions and the subsequent workflow meets requirements for DOI assignment, including that objects assigned a DOI be a citable, enduring part of the scholarly record. The service balances ease of use by researchers, interoperability with existing systems, and flexibility to cater to existing and future use cases...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this diploma thesis is the design, {{development}} and implementation of an end-to-end ECG analysis and visualization IoT system using market ready technologies {{that can be used in}} real life medical applications and scenarios. For the development of the system we chose technologies and frameworks by taking account factors like cost, support, platform portability, backwards compatibility with older versions of software and hardware, power consumption, computational and networking load. The system consists of three main parts, the first part is the embedded Linux based application which reads the ECG signal and transmits it via classic or low energy Bluetooth to a smartphone or tablet. The second part is the android application that receives the ECG signal, stores it on the device, visualizes it (real-time visualization support on BLE connections) and sends it as a http packet through internet to the server for database storing. The last part is the webservice that runs on the server, its task is to receive the packet from the android app, evaluate that the packet has the right format and connect to the database to insert or <b>update</b> <b>the</b> <b>record.</b> The performance of every part of the system was validated by experimental evaluation of trade-offs that affect the run-time operation of all sub-systems, thus leading to the optimum configuration of the complete system...|$|E

Unlike [8 – 10], the DMHP does not incur additional handover delay due to verification and validation of handed over MHs.
