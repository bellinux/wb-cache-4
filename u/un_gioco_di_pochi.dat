5000|$|It {{still seems}} {{uncertain}} whether {{the game of}} primero is of Spanish or Italian origin. Although Daines Barrington is {{of the opinion that}} it is of Spanish origin, a poem of Francesco Berni is the earliest known writing to mention the game; it affords proof that it was at least commonly played in Italy {{at the beginning of the}} 16th century. His work entitled Capitolo del Gioco della Primiera, published in Rome in 1526, and believed to be the earliest extant work describing a card game, contains some particulars on primero. According to David Parlett, the game's card-point system is found in other Italian games but nowhere else. The game is still very much played in central Europe and Spain with Italian-suited cards, under the name of goffo or bambara, remaining the major native vying game of Italy. Alessandro Striggio's madrigal dramatizing a party of the game [...] "II <b>gioco</b> <b>di</b> primiera" [...] was published in 1569.|$|R

40|$|SOMMARIO - Le indagini archeologiche sistematiche, condotte dal 2001 nell’ambito dell'intervento interdisciplinare 'Progetto Egnazia: dallo scavo alla valorizzazione', permettono di rileggere l’intera vicenda della città adriatica, tra periodo messapico e Altomedioevo, e forniscono dati assai interessanti soprattutto per il periodo tardoantico. In particolare intorno alla metà del IV sec. d. C., si registra una netta cesura insediativa, riferibile con ogni probabilità ad un evento calamitoso, oltre che agli effetti della riforma amministrativa di Diocleziano e di Costantino. Tra la fine del IV e gli inizi del V secolo, si assiste, nel volgere <b>di</b> <b>pochi</b> decenni, ad una intensa trasformazione del paesaggio urbano e rurale, in cui risulta determinante il ruolo del vescovo, che all’autorità religiosa unisce la gestione diretta di competenze politiche e di attività economiche, in sostituzione delle magistrature municipali. Il lavoro prende in esame le attestazioni più significative di questo mutamento insediativo, con il riferimento costante alla documentazione dello scavo stratigrafico e ai cospicui materiali, utili a ricostruire il quadro delle produzioni e degli scambi che legano Egnazia all’intero bacino del Mediterraneo. ABSTRACT - The {{research}} of the ‘Progetto Egnazia: dallo scavo alla valorizzazione’, brought on since 2001, allows to recognize in this Adriatic town, {{between the end of}} the 4 th and {{the first half of the}} 5 th century A. D., the beginning of an intensive change, directly related to the power of Bishop that leads to a general renewal of the city together with a big economic development. In this new organization, Christian monuments gain a preeminent role. Particularly, the church of Bishop was built over a workshop area in the late 4 th century and remade in the late 5 th century: the building was enlarged and a new mosaic floor was laid down. At the same time, production and commercial activities settle in wide urban quarters, often occupying areas and structures previously related to other functions. It is very interesting the example of the forum baths, by via Traiana. Between the last years of the 4 th century and the beginning of the 5 th century, the activity of the public balineum is stopped because of the setting up of a workshop dedicated to the production of lime, bricks and tiles, to satisfy the huge need of building-materials. Besides, next to the church of Bishop, at the end of the IVth, another workshop for lime production is set up, with a large size kiln that directly provided to the needs of the church. This urban growth matches with the increasing of trading activity which, in this period, includes the whole basin of the Mediterranean Sea. Evidences of this tight commercial network can be found thanks to the study of coins and imported pottery often decorated with explicit reference to Christian cult...|$|R

40|$|The {{concrete}} and conceptual dialectic between the Greek city-state and the Roman city-territory {{is the first}} key to interpretation which has been raised through this reflection. By using logical and analogical cognitive tools of the Architecture, we aim to comprehend the several meanings which stand in the archaeological landscape of Cuma. We notice that the Roman development of urban areas around the Averno and Pozzuoli, has not only darkened the Greek essence of the site, now only perceived through the Acropolis {{and the beauty of}} the phlegrean landscape, but also created a historical filter which has obscured, throughout the centuries, the geographical dimension and the maritime identity of the most ancient Greek polis of the West. It still prevents the correct interpretation. The intuition of this analytic approach led to a landscape, semantic and analogical reading that reinterprets the geography of spaces, places and relics. It links them all through their systematic and perceptive structure of ‘forms’ which have been identified as well as fixed, myths and symbols throughout the ages. Considering the latest finds, which assign an older founding date to Cuma and the archaic topography which has been proved by geological investigations carried out along the lowest part of the Acropolis, empirical data, theoretical contributions and ancient attestations have been elaborated and contextualized into the current reality. Distinct and conflictual structural matrixes of the two different ideas of the city are now highlighted and joined in the interconnections with later cities (contemporary city is also included) : on one side, the sea, the island, the limits and the geographical rooms of the Greek Cuma; on the other, the relation between monuments and the infrastructural system of the Roman Cuma. We can outline new hypothesis about the foundation and the composite identity of a original insular polis. These make Cuma one of the greatest and most ancient examples of the Greek city-states. Assuming Aldo Rossi’s interpretation of city-state, the analogical comparison with Athens clears up the enlarged polycentric dimension of Cuma and the relation of reciprocal complementarity between the important ‘synoecisms’ which, specifically, converge into aware and planned acts of ‘highest foundation’ and ‘kitsis’. All this leads us to reinterpret Tito Livio’s passage (‘… primo in insulas Aenariam et Pithecusas egressi, deinde in continentem ausi sedes transferre’) especially the idea of ‘sedes’ (also considered as capital city). The meaning of the foundation of Cuma goes beyond the mere creation of an urban settlement, it identifies the consecration, through the eksistics, of the new insular city-state, outpost of the Magna Graecia, by both unitary and composed Greek community which landed, in different times, to Procida, Ischia, Miseno, which at a certain point ‘dares’ moving its sacred structures to the continent. Summarizing, the angle of the interpretation that we have proposed involves: 1) The fact that through the foundation of Cuma the whole phlegran archipelago has been delimited as polis including, right then, the peninsula of Cuma-Miseno connected to the mainland through the ‘istmo <b>di</b> <b>pochi</b> stadi’ of Caldera di Montegrillo; 2) The fact that Cuma, Pithecusa, Procida, Miseno are parts of the same city-state but wish a different planned and synoecistic meaning, related to both the political structure and the landscape-evocative dimension of the polis; 3) The fact that the intrinsic polycentrism, determined by the insular fragmentation of the city-state, increases the value of its natural ‘zoning’ and the integration of the already multicultural Euboea community with locals and people of different origins...|$|R
40|$|Di nessuna delle due mogli di Berengario I – Bertilla, la prima, un’aristocratica di origine supponide e Anna, la seconda, una principessa bizantina – si sono conservate le carte dei dotari. Di entrambe, inoltre, nessuna carta ricorda attività economiche o patrimoniali. Nel contesto familiare di Berengario I emerge però una delle due figlie, Berta, che fu badessa del monastero di San Salvatore di Brescia e poi anche, per nomina paterna, del monastero di San Sisto <b>di</b> Piacenza, fondato <b>pochi</b> decenni prima da Angelberga. Entrambi i monasteri avevano raccolto nei loro patrimoni larghe quote del fisco regio, spesso in prima istanza transitati nei dotari delle regine: le curtes e i monasteri dipendenti erano sparsi in tutta la parte settentrionale della penisola e, in taluni casi, oltrepassavano la linea degli Appennini. Berta appare così assumere presso la corte di Berengario una funzione di grande rilievo nella gestione e nella salvaguardia dei patrimoni di tali monasteri. Of {{none of the}} two {{wives of}} Berengar I - Bertilla, the first, an aristocratic woman from the Supponids and Anna, the second, a Byzantine princess - have been {{preserved}} dower charters; moreover no charter reminds businesses or assets. In the family context of Berengar I emerges, however, one of his two daughters, Berta, who was abbess of the monastery of St. Salvatore in Brescia and later, by his father's appointment, of the monastery of St. Sisto in Piacenza, founded a few decades earlier by Angelberga. Both monasteries were collected in their assets large shares of royal treasury, often {{in the first instance}} passed through in doweries of the queens: the curtes and the dependent monasteries were spread across {{the northern part of the}} peninsula and, in some cases, they passed the line of the Apennines. It looks like as at the court of Berengar Berta  assumes a role of great importance in the management and safeguarding of the assets of these monasteries. </p...|$|R
