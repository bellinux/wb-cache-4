40|$|The {{general rule}} {{underpinning}} both european and polish capital markets {{law is the}} equal access to information concerning financial instruments and their issuers. In {{order to reduce the}} information asymmetry and diminish the risk of insider trading the law provides for issuers' obligation to <b>disclose</b> <b>inside</b> <b>information.</b> The paper tackles the problem of dealing with <b>inside</b> <b>information</b> in case of multi-stage events. on the background of the ecj case law the authors try to answer the question, when information concerning a separate stage may be perceived as an <b>inside</b> <b>information</b> and under what conditions issuer may delay its disclosure. Second issue the paper deals with is whether a listed company may <b>disclose</b> an <b>inside</b> <b>information</b> during the due diligence and if a party to a planned m&a transaction is allowed to use this information while preparing the transaction. The authors come to conclusion that management board of a listed company is permitted to <b>disclose</b> <b>inside</b> <b>information</b> during the due diligence provided that, first, the disclosure does not violate the interest of the company and second - precautionary measures are taken (in particular, further confidentiality of the information is secured) {{in order to ensure that}} no party of the planned m&a transactions takes advantage of the information asymmetry. This view is based on teleological construction of the european and polish law and takes also into regard needs of the business practice. Finally, the provisions of the new market abuse regulation relevant for m&a transactions are presented...|$|R

Rakoff’s holding ran counter to the Second Circuit’s controversial decision in United States v. Newman, 773 F.3d 438 (2d Cir. 2014), which had narrowed the definition of insider trading to situations where the government could prove that the tipper had received a direct financial benefit from the tippee in return for disclosing the information.|$|R
40|$|This Article {{examines}} the seeming irreconcilable conflict {{faced by the}} pension plan fiduciary, who is a corporate insider, to disclose or not to <b>disclose</b> material, <b>inside</b> <b>information</b> to plan participants, who would use the information to divest investments in company stock, without disclosing the same information to persons {{on the other side}} of these trades. The Article begins with a general discussion of the regulation of trade in securities and the history of the insider trading laws under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Part III discusses the soundness of the prohibition against insider trading. Part IV explains the duties imposed on pension plan fiduciaries and how they appear to conflict with the corporate fiduciary 2 ̆ 7 s duty not to trade based upon non-public, <b>inside</b> <b>information.</b> Part V discusses the varying positions taken by the courts that have considered the issue.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} impact of insider trading {{regulation}} and its enforcement on bid-ask spreads, information asymmetry proxies, volatility, trade frequency and trade sizes. It employs an exclusive intra-day market-microstructure data-set for 29 countries and 32 exchanges and utilizes structural simultaneous equations models with distributed geometric lags estimated with GMM, controlling for market architecture, trading demand, minimum tick size and Fama-French factors. This thesis finds that enforcement of insider trading regulation in a country, rather than the strictness of written insider trading law, reduces information asymmetry and bid-ask spreads, increases volatility, and has an overall positive impact on traded value. The positive impact is mostly concentrated in the smallest stocks in the sample. The regulation of disclosure requirements has similar, but not identical, beneficial externalities in the market. The results support the prediction by Bhattacharya and Daouk (2002) that the fall {{in the cost of}} equity that results from insider trading prosecution in a country is due to a reduction in adverse selection. This thesis also find some support of the free <b>inside</b> <b>information</b> scenario of Medrano and Vives (2004), where volatility increases when insiders are forced to <b>disclose</b> the <b>inside</b> <b>information</b> before legally trading on it, if insider trading is not permitted and the regulation is enforced...|$|R

In contrast to prior international studies, which {{are not able to}} link insider transactions to a formal definition of <b>inside</b> <b>information,</b> we relate insider transactions to subsequent releases of <b>inside</b> <b>information</b> via ad-hoc news disclosures. We find evidence that corporate insiders as a group seem to trade on <b>inside</b> <b>information.</b> Moreover, members of the supervisory board seem to be most active in exploiting <b>inside</b> <b>information,</b> since they realize exceptionally high profits with their frequent front-running transactions.|$|R

On March 19, 1990, the case ended in acquittal on Obstruction, and in a mistrial on the other counts. He was retried over the summer and convicted on five counts. and sentenced to six months in prison, 1,000 hours of community service and fined $2,000 on conviction of <b>unlawfully</b> <b>disclosing</b> a Government wiretap and obstructing justice by lying to Federal agents about it.

40|$|Issues {{related to}} insider trading remain popular {{research}} topics. Empirical studies using historical data {{are limited by}} two key factors: 1) the inability to identify exactly who possesses <b>inside</b> <b>information,</b> and 2) the inability to identify the accuracy of information possessed. Advances in information system technology enable us {{to overcome these problems}} in the laboratory. Using this technology, we create a research shell to conduct experiments where we can identify the exact type and quality of information accessible by each trader. Our system includes the capability to monitor individual activities in accessing <b>inside</b> <b>information.</b> The system can automatically impose a monetary penalty if random monitoring identifies a trader accessing <b>inside</b> <b>information.</b> Our experiments involve traders who receive access to <b>inside</b> <b>information</b> without initial knowledge of the quality of that information. The results indicate that traders were able to outperform the market if penalties for being caught accessing such information were not included. Once penalties were included, however, no significant performance differences were observed.

40|$|Our study {{analyzes}} a {{large sample}} of transactions {{carried out by}} corporate insiders reported to the German regulatory authority BaFin in the period July 1, 2002 to April 30, 2005 employing event study methodology.

Therefore we use a distinct property of German law, i. e. company’s obligation to reveal <b>inside</b> <b>information</b> through ad-hoc news disclosures, to link trading of insiders to their foreknowledge of important corporate news. We find strong evidence that insiders exploit <b>inside</b> <b>information</b> as they earn above average profits by front-running on subsequent news disclosures. Furthermore, looking at the type of insider, we find that members of the supervisory board (directors) and the group of other insiders (basically family members of senior managers and directors) profit substantially from exploiting <b>inside</b> <b>information.</b> In contrast, members of the executive board (senior managers) can be largely exculpated from exploiting <b>inside</b> <b>information</b> as they realize below average returns with their rare front-running transactions...|$|R

It stems from a paper I published this year bemoaning our inability to effectively monitor the energy flows associated with short-term climate variability.

We then analyze the extent to which bidders are permitted to build a stake in the target prior to the offer and the prohibition on target companies and classical insiders to trade on information regarding a pending offer. Finally, we address reporting obligations in respect of share transactions by those who have access to <b>inside</b> <b>information,</b> showing that these obligations serve multiple purposes including facilitating enforcement of the prohibition on trading on <b>inside</b> <b>information,</b> improving informational efficiency of the stock market and notifying target management of pending takeovers...|$|R
