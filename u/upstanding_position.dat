40|$|PURPOSE: The {{study of}} the {{interrelation}} between hip and spine disorders is gaining increasing importance in the last years, but the link between Hip Osteoarthritis (HOA) and Low Back Pain (LBP) remains still unclear. Aim {{of the study is}} to assess the relationship between Femoral Neck Anteversion (FNA), LBP, and spinopelvic parameters in patients undergoing Total Hip Replacement (THR) for unilateral severe primary HOA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 91 patients were recruited. Inclusion criteria were: grade 5 or 6 unilateral HOA, according to Turmezei, and Harris Hip score (HHS) 30. Patients were divided into two homogeneous Groups according to the presence (Group-A) or not of concomitant LBP (Group-B). All patients underwent preoperatively a hip CT scan to evaluate FNA, Acetabular Anteversion (AA), and Combined Anteversion (CA = FNA + AA). ΔFNA, ΔAA and ΔCA were calculated as the differences between the arthritic hip and the normal hip angles in each Group. Full spinal X-rays in <b>upstanding</b> <b>position</b> were performed before (baseline) and 6 months after THR (follow-up) to calculate spinopelvic parameters. The health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was evaluated at baseline and at follow-up using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), HHS, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RM), and Short-Form Health Survey (SF- 36). The intra-group and inter-group variability were assessed using, respectively, paired and unpaired t tests. At baseline, the association between HRQoL scores and ΔFNA, ΔAA, and ΔCA was analysed by the Pearson correlation test. RESULTS: At baseline, in Group-A, {{there was a significant difference}} between arthritic FNA and normal hip FNA, while no differences were found in AA between the two hips. A close correlation was observed between ΔFNA and Spine-VAS (r = 0. 788), ODI (r = 0. 824), and RM (r = 0. 775). In Group-B, there was not a significant difference in FNA and AA between the two hips. At recruitment, in Group-A patients, we recorded a higher LL, SS, PI, SVA(C 7), and a lower PT and T 1 -SPI compared with Group-B subjects. Six months after THR, in Group-A, an improvement of all clinical scores was recorded, as well as, a significant reduction of SS, LL, T 1 PA, and SVA(C 7) and an increment of PT. In Group-B, at follow-up, an improvement of HHS, Hip-VAS, and SF- 36 was recorded, while the changes in spinopelvic parameters were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with concomitant unilateral HOA and LBP showed a marked anteverted FNA in the arthritic hip and a spinopelvic misalignment. After THR, a relief of both hip and low back pain and a change in spinopelvic parameters is observed...|$|E
40|$|Smoking in many Western {{societies}} {{has become}} a both moral aand health issue in recent years, but {{little is known about}} how smokers position themselves and regulate their behaviour in this context. In this article, we report the findings from a study investigating how smokers from an economically disadvantaged community in the East Midlands (UK) respond to concerns about the health impact of smoking on others. We conducted ten focus group (FG) discussions with mixed groups (by smoking status and gender; N = 58 participants) covering a range of topics, including smoking norms, self-regulation, and smoking in diverse contexts. We transcribed all FG discussions before analysing the data using techniques from discourse anlysis. Smokers in general positioned themselves as socially responsible smokers and morally <b>upstanding</b> citizens. This <b>position</b> was bolstered in two main ways: ‘everyday accommodation', whereby everyday efforts to accommodate the needs of non-smokers were referenced, and ‘taking a stand', whereby proactive interventions to prevent smoking in (young) others were cited. We suggest that smoking cessation campaigns could usefully be informed by this ethic of care for others...|$|R
