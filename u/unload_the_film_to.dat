5000|$|The {{final section}} of Zorns Lemma {{was shot in}} 1970. Frampton envisioned it as a time for the {{audience}} [...] "to empty the mind". When loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> rolls, he intentionally exposed them to sunlight and created reel-end flares to emphasize [...] "the materiality of film".|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} actions {{need to be}} taken to use a typical large format camera, {{resulting}} in a slower, often more contemplative, photographic style. For example, film loading using sheet film holders requires a dark space <b>to</b> load and <b>unload</b> <b>the</b> <b>film,</b> typically a changing bag or darkroom, although prepackaged film magazines and large format roll films have also been used in the past.|$|R
40|$|Tetracycline, an {{antibiotic}} used against {{a broad range}} of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria was encapsulated in microspheres made of poly(3 -hydroxybutyric acid) P(3 HB), a microbial biodegradable polymer isolated from Bacillus cereus SPV. The drug loaded microspheres were prepared using an oil emulsion technique and compressed uniaxially <b>to</b> produce <b>films.</b> Although <b>the</b> same fabrication conditions were used for preparing the drug loaded and <b>unloaded</b> microspheres, <b>the</b> presence of the drug changed the surface morphology and roughness of <b>the</b> <b>films.</b> <b>The</b> surface morphology of <b>the</b> drug loaded <b>films</b> appeared uneven and coarser and the roughness, with an average root mean square value of 5. 89 ?µm, was significantly higher than that of <b>the</b> <b>unloaded</b> <b>film.</b> <b>The</b> in vitro biocompatibility of <b>the</b> <b>films</b> was investigated using a human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT) by comparing cell viability on <b>the</b> <b>films</b> <b>to</b> that on conventional tissue culture plastics. Both <b>films</b> appear <b>to</b> support cell growth but cell attachment and percentage cell viability were greater on <b>the</b> drug loaded <b>films</b> (32 % of control) compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>unloaded</b> <b>film</b> (10 % of control), possibly {{as a result of the}} non-uniform surface morphology and increased roughness of <b>the</b> drug loaded <b>film.</b> Thus, <b>the</b> above results illustrate that <b>the</b> drug loaded <b>films,</b> in addition <b>to</b> being a suitable matrix for drug delivery, represent an improved substrate for keratinocyte cell attachment...|$|R
25|$|The 8 × 10 cameras he {{preferred}} were large and heavy, {{and due to}} the weight {{and the cost of}} <b>the</b> <b>film</b> he never carried more than twelve sheet film holders with him. At the end of each day, he had to go into a darkroom, <b>unload</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> holders and load them with new film. This was especially challenging when he was traveling since he had to find a darkened room somewhere or else set up a makeshift darkroom made from heavy canvas.|$|R
50|$|At {{first the}} studio's {{executives}} are keen <b>to</b> <b>unload</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> onto Felix and move on, but when Sally goes {{through with the}} topless scene and <b>the</b> <b>film</b> seems a likely success, they plot to regain control. Using California's community property laws, they get the distribution and final-cut rights by persuading Sally to sign them over.

50|$|Peterson's {{invention}} {{and development of}} the Instamatic camera at Eastman Kodak in the 1960s heralded an unprecedented explosion in amateur snapshot photography. With over 70 million units sold by 1970, there were very few American households without an Instamatic. Based on the simple idea that loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> in a camera ought to be a one-step process, the development of <b>the</b> drop-in <b>film</b> cartridge and a line of easy-to-use cameras for it created a phenomenon. Not since George Eastman's introduction of roll film had there been such a sales spike in the photo industry.|$|R
40|$|An {{electrochemical}} method for metal ion separations, called Electrically Switched Ion Exchange, is described. Direct oxidation and reduction of an electroactive <b>film</b> attached <b>to</b> an electrode surface is used <b>to</b> load and <b>unload</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> with alkali metal cations. <b>The</b> electroactive <b>films</b> under investigation are Ni hexacyanoferrates, which are deposited {{on the surface}} by applying an anodic potential to a Ni electrode in a solution containing the ferricyanide anion. Reported film preparation procedures were modified <b>to</b> produce <b>films</b> with improved capacity and stability. Electrochemical behavior of the derivatized electrodes were investigated using cyclic voltammetry and chronocoulometry. <b>The</b> <b>films</b> show selectivity for Cs in concentrated sodium solutions. Raman spectroscopy was used to monitor changes in oxidation state of <b>the</b> <b>film</b> and imaging experiments have demonstrated that the redox reactions are spatially homogenous across <b>the</b> <b>film.</b> Requirements for a bench scale unit were identified...|$|R
40|$|Poly(3 -hydroxyoctanoate) /poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate), P(3 HO) /P(3 HB), blend films {{loaded with}} aspirin were prepared, and the {{influence}} of aspirin loading on the surface properties, mechanical, thermal and degradation properties were investigated. Scanning electron microscopy images revealed that the addition of aspirin introduced a new topography on the surface of <b>the</b> blend <b>films.</b> Aspirin contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> increase in the hydrophilic nature of <b>the</b> blend <b>films</b> compared with <b>the</b> <b>unloaded</b> blend <b>films.</b> This was complemented by a considerable increase in the total protein adsorption in <b>the</b> aspirin-loaded blend <b>films.</b> <b>The</b> percentage cell viability was higher in <b>the</b> aspirin-loaded blend <b>films</b> compared with <b>the</b> <b>unloaded</b> blend <b>films.</b> There was a decrease in the tensile strength and the Young’s modulus with the addition of the aspirin.

40|$|If Hollywood’s heartfelt {{endorsement}} of a <b>film</b> accurately reflects <b>the</b> passions of popular culture, evidence supports {{the hypothesis that}} we are collectively {{in love with the}} underdog. At this writing, the quintessential underdog story, Slumdog Millionaire, has been nominated for 10 Academy Awards and recently won awards in the four Golden Globe categories in which it was nominated. The rags-to-riches struggle of Jamal, one of three orphaned Indian children representing the poorest of the world’s poor, is capturing a worldwide following. Adding to the underdog tale illustrated in <b>the</b> <b>film</b> is <b>the</b> story of the movie’s distribution and release. The first American distributor for Slumdog was hit hard by the economic downturn and was forced to stop operations before <b>the</b> <b>film</b> was released. Desperately looking <b>to</b> <b>unload</b> <b>the</b> <b>film,</b> <b>the</b> company sold the distribution rights. However, the purchaser bought only half of the rights, acquiring them for a very limited North American release.
