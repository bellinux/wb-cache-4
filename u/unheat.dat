40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} work was to investigate the corrosion behaviour of basalt short fiber reinforced aluminum metal matrix composites (MMCs) in alkaline solution using weight loss method. The Al/basalt MMCs contains basalt short fiber from 2. 5 to 10 % in steps of 2. 5 wt. % and fabricated using liquid metallurgy technique. The corrosion characteristics of Al/basalt short fiber composite and the unreinforced alloy were experimentally assessed. The corrosion test was carried out at different temperatures in mixture of sodium-chloride alkaline solution at a concentration of 1 N, 2 N & 3 N for different exposure time were subjected to corrosive media to evaluate their corrosion resistance. The results indicated that corrosion rate of metal matrix composites was lower than that of matrix material Al 7075 under the corrosive atmosphere for both <b>unheat</b> treated and heat treated conditions. Al/basalt short fiber composite become more corrosion prone as the basalt short fiber content is increased, and the corrosion rate in sodium chloride alkaline decreases with time, probably because of the formation of stable oxide layer over the specimens.

A espécie C. chloropyga, foi selecionada por seu comportamento semelhante em dieta natural (carcaça) e na dieta de leite e levedura (STOFFOLANO, 1974). Verificou-se inicialmente, o efeito de diferentes niveis de proteína na dieta, no desenvolvimento das larvas, utilizando-se a:rcD fonte proteica leite em pó {{integral}}, leite em pó integral combinado com levedura, caseína e caseína combinada com levedura, nos níveis de 2, 4, 6, 8 e 10 %. Nas dietas de leite e de leite e levedura, as porcentagens de ganho de peso foram proporcionais ao nível de proteína das dietas nos níveis 2 e 4 %. Nos níveis 6, 8 e 10 %, não houve crescimento, provavelmente devido à alta concentração de sólidos nas dietas. Com a utilização de caseína e caseína combinada com levedura, obtivemos respostas de crescimento proporcionais ao níve 1 de proteína das dietas até o nível 8 % para as dietas de caseína e levedura e até o nível 10 %, para as dietas de caseína. Como as dietas contendo levedura apresentaram resultados superiores aos obtidos somente com leite ou caseína como fontes proteicas e, sendo levedura uma fonte rica em ácido ribonucleico, este substituiu a levedura nas dietas de caseína, obtendo-se resultados superiores aos até então obtidos. - A série de dietas contendo caseína e RNA foi por este motivo utilizada como padrão nos ensaios subseqüentes. Verificamos então, respostas das larvas quando proteinas de diferentes origens eram adicionadas às dietas. No primeiro grupo de dietas as farinhas das leguminosas feijão e soja foram utilizadas, testando-se também o efeito de tratamento térmico e o de suplementação com metionina no desenvolvimento das larvas. A suplementação de feijão crú com metionina não aumentou a porcentagem de ganho de peso das larvas, o que ocorreu após o tratamento térmico e também com a suplementação da farinha tratada. Nas dietas com farinha de soja crua, quando suplementadas com metionina, as larvas apresentaram porcentagem de ganho de peso maior do que as dietas não suplementadas. O tratamento térmico também melhorou a qualidade das dietas. Os cereais arroz, milho e trigo foram utilizados como contendo cereal como única fonte proteica, para milho e trigo. A suplementação das dietas com aminoácidos limitantes produziu resultados superiores ou próximos aos obtidos com as dietas complementadas. Um último ensaio foi realizado utilizando-se ovo integral liofilizado como fonte proteica, obtendo-se resultados bastante satisfatórios, embora as dietas não contivessem RNA adicionado, confirmando que o desempenho da dieta depende do balanço adequado de nutrientesAbstract:The {{growth of}} Chrysomya albiceps, Chrysomya chloropyga and Chrysomya megaceplala larvae toward a natural (mice carcass) and milk-yeast diets was studied. The larva of C. chloropyga {{was selected because}} of its identical growth in both diets. Experiments were carried out to study the effect of different protein levels and different protein sources as well. Four pratein sources were utilized in this study: l) dried whole milk, 2) dried whole milk-plusyeast, 3) casein and 4) casein cornbined with yeast. The protein levels were 2,	 4, 6, 8 and 10 % for {{each one of the}} diets. In the dried whole milk and dried whole milk-plus-yeast the gain in body weight was proportional to the protein content of the diets, at the levels af 2 and 4 %. At 6, 8 and 10 % the growth was impaired, probably due to the high solid concentration in the diets. When the caseio and the casein-plus-yeast diets were utilized, the growth was proportional to the protein content of the diets up to the leveI of 8 %, {{in the case of the}} casein plus-yeast diet, and up to 10 % for the casein diet. When yeast was incorporated to the diets, the growth rates were always higher than those obtained without it. 	This result was not surprising sinee yeasts are a good natural source of ribonucleic acid. The addition of RNA to the casein diet showed even better results, in terms of growth, than the casein-plus-yeast diet. For this reason, the casein diet to which RNA was added, was taken as the standard diet throughout this study. The effect af different protein saurces on the growth rates of C. chloropyga larvas was investigated in another set of experiments. The ability of bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and soy-bean (Glycine max) proteins to support grawth as well as the effect of heat treatment and L-methionine supplementation were studied. The larvae did not respond to the supplementation of the unheated bean protein with L-methionine, however the growth rates were higher when the flour was heat-treated and when the heated-treated flour was supplemented with L-methionine. In the case of unheated soy flour, there was a better growth response after L-methionine addition; heated soy flour supported higher growth rates than the <b>unheat</b> flour both with and without L-methionine addition. Rice corn and wheat were also testes as protein sources for the C. Chloropyga larvae. Corn and wheat when supplemented with limiting amino acids elicited a better growth response than the unsupplemented sources. Supplementation of corn, rice and wheat with bean and soy-bean protein was beneficial to the growth of C. Chloropyga larvae. Dried whole egg vlas also tested, giving higher growth rates when compared with any other protein sourc...|$|E

40|$|The {{penetration}} of α-chymotrypsin and/or pancreatic lipase into dead cells of soybean cotyledons, of yeast and of algae was studied using the enzymic activity as a parameter. In addition a fluorescent antibody technique {{was applied for}} the localization of α-chymotrypsin within the soybean cells. The digestibility of <b>unheated,</b> EDTA-treated substrate {{was similar to that}} of the heated substrate. Since EDTA-treatment increases the permeability of the cell wall and cell membrane of the plant cell without denaturing proteins contained in the cells, we concluded that heating affected mainly the barrier formed by the cell wall, thus permitting a better passage of big molecules (enzymes). Leakage of β-amylase (mol. weight 61, 700) from soybean occurred only after treatment with EDTA. This confirmed that EDTA enhances the permeability of the cell wall. α-Chymotrypsin (mol. weight 24, 000) and pancreatic lipase (mol. weight 38, 000) penetrated <b>unheated</b> sections, whereas amylopectin (mol. weight 50, 000 - 1, 000, 000) did not penetrate <b>unheated</b> cotyledons. Apparently the greater dimension of amylopectin compared with α-chymotrypsin and lipase accounts for its lack of entry into <b>unheated</b> soybean cotyledons. However, when we applied the fluorescent antibody technique to localize α-chymotrypsin within the cells from <b>unheated</b> sections, we used antibodies (γ-globulins) having a mol. weight of 150, 000. They entered the <b>unheated</b> sections and produced a positive result of the experiment. Consequently the size of the molecules as indicated by the molecular weight, is not the reason why amylopectin did not penetrate the <b>unheated</b> cotyledons. Moreover, this shows that α-chymotrypsin probably opens a way for the entry of globulins. Therefore the entry of proteolytic enzymes is not an inert process. This is conceivable as the enzymes are big molecules with catalytic activity. <b>Unheated</b> non-EDTA-treated soybean (with plasmodesmata) was slightly penetrated by α-chymotrypsin, whereas <b>unheated</b> non-EDTA-treated yeast and algae (both without plasmodesmata) were not penetrated at all. Furthermore, in soybean material (<b>unheated</b> or heated) α-chymotrypsin enhanced the {{penetration of}} lipase; this effect was absent in the case of yeast. The results obtained strongly suggest that plasmodesmata are a way in dead plant cells for penetration of enzymes...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the presence investigation is to study the droplet impingement characteristics on heated and <b>unheated</b> surfaces with different surface roughness. The purpose is to show clear photographs of the impinging droplets from beneath the solid surface. Atmospheric pressure (lOlkpa), surface materials (glass and copper), impinging droplet temperature (T, = 24 C), original droplet diameter (4. 7 mm), and testing liquid (H 20) were fixed. A MotionScope PCI 8000 S high-speed camera was placed beneath the heated glass surface. Droplets of water were dropped on the test surface, which is located 25 mm to 50 mm under {{the tip of a}} burette. For the <b>unheated</b> surfaces, the droplet was positioned above the surface between 23 mm and 229 mm. Thus, the primary parameter was the Weber number, which ranged from 30 to 60 for heated surface and 29 to 290 for <b>unheated</b> surfaces. Furthermore, the effects of <b>unheated</b> copper surfaces with different surface roughness and droplet characteristic were experimentally studied. Surface temperature was fixed at Tw = 24 C whereas Weber number varied from 53 to 266. Impinging of water droplets upon <b>unheated</b> glass surface was also tested at fixed surface temperature of Tw = 24 C. However, Weber number was varied from 29 to 290 for <b>unheated</b> glass surface. Finally, a theoretical study was conducted to compare the experimental results with the theoretical results. As a result, surface temperature was found to have very little effect on the spreading process of the impinging droplet upon both heated and <b>unheated</b> glass surface. Moreover, the results from impinging droplets upon <b>unheated</b> copper and glass surface were also analyzed. It was found that surface roughness exhibited no significant effect on the spreading process. The measurement values of maximum spreading diameter collected in the present investigation compare well with the predictions model provided by previous investigators. However, the maximum spreading time of the impinging droplets upon both heated and <b>unheated</b> surface did not correlate well with the previous models...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background To {{evaluate}} whether heated serum allows for earlier detection of Dirofilaria immitis antigen, dogs with experimental D. immitis infections underwent weekly blood sampling to compare antigen results using both heated and <b>unheated</b> serum. Methods One of two isolates (JYD- 34 or Big Head™) {{were used to}} infect naïve laboratory beagle dogs. Serum was collected from dogs weekly and divided into two aliquots, heated and <b>unheated.</b> The samples designated as heated were placed in a heat block at 104  °C for 10  min then centrifuged with collection of the resulting supernatant. Two commercial ELISAs, DiroCHEK® (Synbiotics Corporation, Zoetis) and PetChek® (IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.), were used to conduct D. immitis antigen testing on all serum samples. Results There was no statistical difference in {{the mean number of}} days from infection to positive D. immitis antigen status between the two commercial testing kits (DiroCHEK® versus PetChek®) with either heated or <b>unheated</b> serum. When <b>unheated</b> serum was utilized, very strong agreement between the two assays was demonstrated using Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient (R c  =  0. 98). However, when heated serum was compared, Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient was only R c  =  0. 64, showing a lesser agreement. There was a statistical difference in the mean number of days from infection to a positive test result for <b>unheated</b> serum when compared to mean days to positive status with heated serum. For DiroCHEK® the heated serum yielded a positive result 126. 9  ±  18. 9  days postinfection while the <b>unheated</b> serum yielded a positive result 162. 6  ±  23. 0  days postinfection; this was a significant 35. 7  ±  32. 2  days longer, on average, compared with heated serum. With PetChek® the heated serum yielded a positive result 131. 5  ±  11. 7  days postinfection while the <b>unheated</b> serum yielded a positive result 162. 8  ±  23. 8  days postinfection; this was a significant 31. 3  ±  25. 5  days longer, on average, compared with heated serum. The detection of D. immitis antigen earlier using heated serum was consistent for both heartworm isolates.

Studies that evaluate ecological and socio-economic sustainability-factors of these production techniques are scarce. In this study, we analyze the greenhouse gas emissions along vegetable supply chains based on a life cycle approach and investigate factors of the socio-economic system towards future market diffusion of these new-old technologies based on the Sustainability Assessment of Food and Agriculture Systems (SAFA) guidelines of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Data of the supply-chains of lettuce, spinach, scallions and red radish was collected from field trials in different climatic regions in Austria and compared to existing commercial systems in Austria and Italy. The results show, that <b>unheated</b> winter vegetable production is feasible. Greenhouse gas emissions of <b>unheated</b> vegetables are lower with 0. 06 e 0. 12 kg CO 2 equivalent versus 0. 61 e 0. 64 kg CO 2 equivalent per kg fresh product crops from heated systems.
