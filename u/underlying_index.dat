25|$|The re-indexing {{problem of}} {{leveraged}} ETFs {{stems from the}} arithmetic effect of volatility of the <b>underlying</b> <b>index.</b> Take, for example, an index that begins at 100 and a 2X fund based on that index that also starts at 100. In a first trading period (for example, a day), the index rises 10% to 110. The 2X fund will then rise 20% to 120. The index then drops back to 100 (a drop of 9.09%), {{so that it is}} now even. The drop in the 2X fund will be 18.18% (2*9.09). But 18.18% of 120 is 21.82. This puts the value of the 2X fund at 98.18. Even though the index is unchanged after two trading periods, an investor in the 2X fund would have lost 1.82%. This decline in value can be even greater for inverse funds (leveraged funds with negative multipliers such as -1, -2, or -3). It always occurs when the change in value of the <b>underlying</b> <b>index</b> changes direction. And the decay in value increases with volatility of the <b>underlying</b> <b>index.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} {{leverage}} is {{also reflected in}} the pricing of options written on leveraged ETFs. In particular, the terminal payoff of a leveraged ETF European/American put or call depends on the realized variance (hence the path) of the <b>underlying</b> <b>index.</b> The impact of leverage ratio can also be observed from the implied volatility surfaces of leveraged ETF options. For instance, the implied volatility curves of inverse leveraged ETFs (with negative multipliers such as -1, -2, or -3) are commonly observed to be increasing in strike, which is characteristically different from the implied volatility smiles or skews seen for index options or non-leveraged ETF options.|$|E
25|$|ETFs are {{structured}} for tax efficiency {{and can be}} more attractive than mutual funds. In the U.S., whenever a mutual fund realizes a capital gain that is not balanced by a realized loss, the mutual fund must distribute the capital gains to its shareholders. This can happen whenever the mutual fund sells portfolio securities, whether to reallocate its investments or to fund shareholder redemptions. These gains are taxable to all shareholders, even those who reinvest the gains distributions in more shares of the fund. In contrast, ETFs are not redeemed by holders (instead, holders simply sell their ETF shares on the stock market, as they would a stock, or effect a non-taxable redemption of a creation unit for portfolio securities), so that investors generally only realize capital gains when they sell their own shares or when the ETF trades to reflect changes in the <b>underlying</b> <b>index.</b>|$|E
50|$|STOXX calculates and {{distributes}} {{the well}} known EURO STOXX 50, STOXX Europe 50, and STOXX Europe 600 indices, {{which are used}} as the <b>underlying</b> <b>indices</b> for numerous derivative financial instruments such as options, futures and index funds.|$|R
50|$|Source {{became the}} first European ETF {{provider}} to launch 18 innovative sector products that are built to benefit from diversification, liquidity and availability of stocks to borrow in the <b>underlying</b> <b>indices.</b> The <b>underlying</b> <b>indices,</b> the STOXX European 600 Optimised Supersector indices, were specifically created by STOXX and Source in July 2010. At the same time, Source also initiated a first large scale create-to-lend on ETFs in Europe. As a result, Source sector products turnover increased, this has also tightened bid-offer spreads lowering the cost of owning products benefiting all market participants. Since launch in July 2010, the Source Optimised Sector ETFs have increased the overall sector turnover by over 700% and continues to capture over 80% of the sector turnover.|$|R
50|$|Index funds {{invest in}} {{securities}} to mirror a market index, {{such as the}} S&P 500. An index fund buys and sells securities {{in a manner that}} mirrors the composition of the selected index. The fund's performance tracks the <b>underlying</b> <b>index's</b> performance. Turnover of securities in an index fund's portfolio is minimal. As a result, an index fund generally has lower management costs than other types of funds.|$|R
25|$|The ETF {{tracking}} error {{is the difference}} between the returns of the ETF and its reference index or asset. A non-zero {{tracking error}} therefore represents a failure to replicate the reference as stated in the ETF prospectus. The tracking error is computed based on the prevailing price of the ETF and its reference. It is different than the premium/discount which {{is the difference between}} the ETF’s NAV (updated only once a day) and its market price. Tracking errors are more significant when the ETF provider uses strategies other than full replication of the <b>underlying</b> <b>index.</b> Some of the most liquid equity ETFs tend to have better tracking performance because the underlying is also sufficiently liquid, allowing for full replication. In contrast, some ETFs, such as commodities ETFs and their leveraged ETFs, do not necessarily employ full replication because the physical assets cannot be stored easily or used to create a leveraged exposure, or the reference asset or index is illiquid. Futures-based ETFs may also suffer from negative roll yields, as seen in the VIX futures market.|$|E
25|$|This {{approach}} requires building {{a model of}} the <b>underlying</b> <b>index,</b> i.e. the one upon which the derivative value is determined (for example monthly/seasonal cumulative heating degree days). The simplest way to model the index is just to model the distribution of historical index outcomes. We can adopt parametric or non-parametric distributions. For monthly cooling and heating degree days, assuming a normal distribution is usually warranted. The predictive power of such a model is rather limited. A better result can be obtained by modelling the index generating process on a finer scale. In the case of temperature contracts, {{a model of the}} daily average (or min and max) temperature time series can be built. The daily temperature (or rain, snow, wind, etc.) model can be built using common statistical time series models (i.e. ARMA or Fourier transform in the frequency domain) purely based only on the features displayed in the historical time series of the index. A more sophisticated approach is to incorporate some physical intuition/relationships into our statistical models based on spatial and temporal correlation between weather occurring {{in various parts of the}} ocean-atmosphere system around the world (for example, we can incorporate the effects of El Niño on temperatures and rainfall).|$|E
2500|$|Some index ETFs invest 100% {{of their}} assets proportionately in the {{securities}} underlying an index, a manner of investing called replication. Other index ETFs use representative sampling, investing 80% to 95% {{of their assets}} in the securities of an <b>underlying</b> <b>index</b> and investing the remaining 5% to 20% of their assets in other holdings, such as futures, option and swap contracts, and securities not in the <b>underlying</b> <b>index,</b> that the fund's adviser believes will help the ETF to achieve its investment objective. There are various ways the ETF can be weighted, such as equal weighting or revenue weighting. For index ETFs that invest in indices with thousands of underlying securities, some index ETFs employ [...] "aggressive sampling" [...] and invest in only a tiny percentage of the underlying securities.|$|E

The present study is an attempt to explain the risk and return features of Indian ETFs and their trading and expense characteristics. The performance of ETFs is measured and compared with their <b>underlying</b> <b>indices.</b> It is found that they underperformed the indices, the reasons being they load their investors with extra risk than their <b>underlying</b> <b>indices.</b> Further, it is found that tracking error is having a positive relationship with expenses and risk of ETFs. Interestingly, the average number of trades and the lagged return of previous day do not affect the volume of shares. The study uses daily closing prices, intraday high and low prices and the volume of the traded shares of 10 ETFs listed on the National Stock Exchang for the period 1 st July, 2010 to 30 th June, 2015.

40|$|Previous {{researchers}} {{find that}} country iShares are directly and strongly exposed to US market risk {{in addition to}} home country market risk. This finding contradicts the fact that by design these iShares should behave as their <b>underlying</b> market <b>indices</b> behave. With monthly data and the appropriate orthogonalization choice, we find that direct US market risk exposure is weaker, less significant and less prevalent than previously suggested. Further tests indicate that in fact a strong majority of country iShares do not behave significantly differently from their <b>underlying</b> market <b>indices.</b> Hence, they are not less effective as diversification instruments to US investors than direct investments in the foreign markets as represented by their <b>underlying</b> market <b>indices.</b> Copyright (c) 2009 The Authors Journal compilation (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the potential of}} the analysis of noisy non-stationary time series by quantizing it into streams of discrete symbols and applying finite-memory symbolic predictors. Careful quantization can reduce the noise in the time series to make model estimation more amenable. We apply the quantization strategy in a realistic setting involving financial forecasting and trading. In particular, using historical data, we simulate the trading of straddles on the financial indexes DAX and FTSE 100 on a daily basis, based on predictions of the daily volatility differences in the <b>underlying</b> <b>indexes...</b>|$|R
2500|$|To apply {{an index}} on a rate plus margin basis {{means that the}} {{interest}} rate will equal the <b>underlying</b> <b>index</b> plus a margin.

2500|$|A variable-rate {{mortgage}}, adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), or tracker mortgage is {{a mortgage}} loan with {{the interest rate}} on the note periodically adjusted based on an index which reflects {{the cost to the}} lender of borrowing on the credit markets.

There may be a direct and legally defined link to the <b>underlying</b> <b>index,</b> but where the lender offers no specific link to the underlying market or index the rate can be changed at the lender's discretion. The term [...] "variable-rate mortgage" [...] is most common outside the United States, whilst in the United States, [...] "adjustable-rate mortgage" [...] is most common, and implies a mortgage regulated by the Federal government, with caps on charges. In many countries, adjustable rate mortgages are the norm, and in such places, may simply be referred to as mortgages.|$|E

25|$|Btrieve {{is not a}} {{relational}} database management system (RDBMS). Early descriptions of Btrieve {{referred to it as}} a record manager (though Pervasive initially used the term navigational database but later changed this to transactional database) because it only deals with the underlying record creation, data retrieval, record updating and data deletion primitives. It uses ISAM as its <b>underlying</b> <b>indexing</b> and storage mechanism. A key part of Pervasive's architecture is the use of a MicroKernel Database Engine, which allows different database backends to be modularised and integrated easily into their DBMS package, Pervasive.SQL.

30|$|Selection from {{available}} welfare studies: By far, {{the most}} frequently used procedure for selecting the relevant DEA indicators is the reference to already established welfare indices and rankings (e.g., Jablonsky 2004; Murias et al. 2006; Lee et al. 2006; Bougnol et al. 2010). Thereby, sub-indicators are often used, or their <b>underlying</b> <b>indices</b> are adopted directly as DEA indicators. In principle, this approach offers the advantage of data sets not needing to be elaborately collected and of their presumably having been checked for errors during their initial use. However, the use of index numbers can constitute a problem if volume measures are also used at the same time (Dyson et al. 2001).|$|R
50|$|These ETPs {{will result}} in a direct {{multiple}} of the return of an underlying asset. Therefore, a 3x leveraged ETP tracking the FTSE 100 will amplify the daily return of the <b>underlying</b> <b>index</b> by a multiple of 3.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study is to reveal the {{characteristics}} of the terminological structure formed by the index terms of junior-high school, high school and university-level textbooks. We first identify the types of concept of index terms, and then uncover the conceptual structure that <b>underlies</b> <b>index</b> terms. We found that, as the school level progresses, (1) the balance of concept types of index terms shift from concrete objects to their behaviours or features, (2) index terms as a whole shifts from a set of fragmented terms to a single indirectly-related group, (3) the core part of the index terms comes to be occupied by terms which represent concepts other than concrete objects...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a new approach}} to ranking speech utterances by a system’s confidence that they contain a spoken word. Multiple alternate pronunciations, or degradations, of a query word’s phoneme sequence are hypothesized and incorporated into the ranking function. We consider two methods for hypothesizing these degradations, the best of which is constructed using factored phrasebased statistical machine translation. We show that this approach is able to significantly improve upon a state-of-the-art baseline technique in an evaluation on held-out speech. We evaluate our systems using three different methods for indexing the speech utterances (using phoneme, phoneme multigram, and word recognition), and find that degradation modeling shows particular promise for locating out-of-vocabulary words when the <b>underlying</b> <b>indexing</b> system is constructed with standard word-based speech recognition. ...|$|R

A user-centric card sorting method is proposed for designing intuitive views for the end-users and a method for mapping its facets onto the indexing ontologies and search items is presented.
