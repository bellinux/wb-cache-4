5|$|Scully finds a {{disassembled}} {{utility knife}} {{at the latest}} crime scene with Mulder's prints on it and discovers that the murder weapon is missing from the evidence room. She meets with Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), who is also worried about Mulder's behavior. Mulder has a nightmare about being attacked by a gargoyle that is really himself. He wakes <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>goes</b> to Mostow's studio again, finding a severed arm. Scully gets a message to call Nemhauser, but his phone is answered by Mulder, who denies taking the knife. Mulder searches Mostow's studio and finds Nemhauser's body inside a new sculpture. Mulder is then confronted by Patterson, who is unaware of how {{he arrived at the}} studio. Mulder then deduces that Patterson is the killer, based on his three-year obsession with Mostow and his request for Mulder to investigate the case. Mulder confronts him, but Patterson flees when Scully arrives. Mulder pursues him and they fight; Patterson is shot and apprehended.|$|E

In the evening, after debating whether to sit in the front or back of a convertible, Black and her friends ride the car to a party at 7:45 pm. Patrice Wilson appears {{near the end of the}} song to deliver a short rap. The video was shot on January 6, 2011 at Black's father's house with friends and family as extras, and requiring multiple takes over 12 hours. Some of those extras became stars in their own right; her friends Benni Cinkle, Amanda Cooper and Hayley Grodt. Ark Music, according to Black's parents, cautioned them and her that they should not expect her to become famous. Black hoped that her friends and family would enjoy watching the video on YouTube and that it would perhaps help her to later begin a singing career.|$|E

The timed <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> test measures basic mobility skills including a sequence of functional manoeuvres used in everyday life. OBJECTIVES: to create a practical cut-off value to indicate normal versus below normal timed <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> test performance by comparing test performance of community-dwelling and institutionalised elderly women. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 413 community-dwelling and 78 institutionalised mobile elderly women (age range 65 - 85 years) were enrolled in a cross-sectional study. MEASUREMENTS: timed <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> test duration, residential and mobility status, age, height, weight and body mass index were documented. RESULTS: 92 % of community-dwelling elderly women performed the timed <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> test in less than 12 seconds and all community-dwelling women had times below 20 seconds. In contrast only 9 % of institutionalised elderly women performed the timed <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> test in less than 12 seconds, 42 % were below 20 seconds, 32 % had results between 20 and 30 seconds and 26 % were above 30 seconds. The 10 (th) - 90 (th) percentiles for timed <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> test performance were 6. 0 - 11. 2 seconds for community-dwelling and 12. 7 - 50. 1 seconds for institutionalised elderly women. When stratifying participants according to mobility status, the timed <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> test duration increased significantly with decreasing mobility (Kruskall-Wallis-test: p> 0. 0001). Linear regression modelling identified residential status (p> 0. 0001) and {{physical mobility}} status (p> 0. 0001) as significant predictors of timed <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> performance. This model predicted 54 % of total variation of timed <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> test performance. CONCLUSION: residential and mobility status were identified as the strongest predictors of timed <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> test performance. We recommend the timed <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> test as a screening tool to determine whether an in-depth mobility assessment and early intervention, such as prescription of a walking aid, home visit or physiotherapy, is necessary. Community-dwelling elderly women between 65 and 85 years of age should be able to perform the timed <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> test in 12 seconds or less...|$|R

Once at the top, the train goes through a pre-drop before making a sharp downward left {{turn back to the}} ground. When the train reaches the bottom, it then enters a vertical loop. Upon exiting the loop, the train then rises back <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>goes</b> through a dive loop. The train then makes a 180 degree left turn through the loop before going through a set of trim brakes. Next, the train enters a zero-gravity roll followed by a right turn leading into interlocking corkscrews.

The train then makes another left turn into the final brake run which leads back to the station. One cycle of the ride lasts about 2 minutes and 20 seconds.|$|E
500|$|With around 1600 {{pages in}} {{manuscript}} length, A Dance with Dragons was eventually published in July 2011 {{after six years}} of writing, longer in page count and writing time than any of the preceding four novels. The story of A Dance with Dragons catches <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>goes</b> beyond A Feast for Crows around two-thirds into the book, but nevertheless covers less story than Martin had intended, omitting at least one planned large battle sequence and leaving several character threads ending in cliff-hangers. Martin attributed the delay mainly to his untangling [...] "the Meereenese knot", which the interviewer understood as [...] "making the chronology and characters mesh up as various threads converged on [...] ". Martin also acknowledged spending too much time on rewriting and perfecting the story, but soundly rejected the theories of some of his critics that he had lost interest in the series or would bide his time to make more money.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} {{the effect of}} chair seat height and turning direction on the Timed <b>Up</b> <b>and</b> <b>Go</b> scores of patients after stroke. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. Setting: A geriatric day hospital in Hong Kong. SUBJECTS: Twenty-five patients with sub-acute stroke. METHODS: The time taken to complete the Timed <b>Up</b> <b>and</b> <b>Go</b> test with various chair seat heights (65 %, 90 % and 115 % of each subject’s leg length – distance from lateral knee joint line to ground in sitting) and turning directions (toward the affected and unaffected side) was recorded using a stopwatch with randomized test order. RESULTS: There were significant differences in Timed <b>Up</b> <b>and</b> <b>Go</b> scores between the 3 levels of chair seat height (p[*]<[*] 0. 001), with the lowest Timed <b>Up</b> <b>and</b> <b>Go</b> scores recorded when the seat height was 115 % of the subject’s leg length and the highest at a seat height of 65 % of the subject’s leg length. Turning toward the affected side {{was found to be}} significantly quicker than turning toward the unaffected side (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). CONCLUSION: Chair seat height and turning direction significantly influence the Timed <b>Up</b> <b>and</b> <b>Go</b> scores of patients after sub-acute stroke. Optimizing chair seat height with reference to subject’s leg length and turning direction is essential when using the Timed <b>Up</b> <b>and</b> <b>Go</b> test as an outcome measure in stroke rehabilitation.

500|$|Adams {{performed}} about 80 shots per exhibition.

The abundance of shots was unusual, and was described by one sports writer as [...] "more extensive than the entire billiard fraternity put together". The following description of Adams' shots appeared in an 1891 newspaper article, which highlighted them as, [...] "among his difficult feats":Two quart wine bottles are placed at {{the short end of}} the table, three feet apart; a ball is placed on the top of each bottle, and a third ball, six feet from the bottles in the opposite corner. Adams makes the hand ball jump from bottle to bottle then to take an English in space, counting on the third bail, a double shot.Fifteen balls are placed in a line, three inches apart. On the last ball is placed a piece of chalk, while two feet from the other end, at a square angle, is placed a single ball. Yank drops the hand ball with a Massé twist, which, after hitting the single ball, describes a semi-circle, taken the cushion first, then makes a carrom on the fifteen balls, but is played with such a delicate calculation as barely to reach the last ball; in fact, freezes against it so gently as not to dislodge the chalk previously placed thereon.A derby hat is placed on the table, under which is a ball. One foot from the hat are two balls a foot apart, which he carroms on, the hand ball continues striking the rim of the hat, forces it <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>goes</b> under making the stroke on the third ball, then returns from under the hat when it rocks the second time.He also stand {{at the head of the}} table, throwing the balls with a hundred-yard force but has them stop eight feet away in such a position as to spell his name.|$|E
