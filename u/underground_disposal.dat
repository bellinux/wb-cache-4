Working with Conoco and receiving encouragement born the Department of Energy, Metarie Office, and the Texas Railroad Commission the corporation conducted extensive feasibility studies on an on-site disposal concept. In May 1994, the Department of Energy issued a solicitation for cooperative agreement proposal for, "Development and Testing of a Method for Treatment and <b>Underground</b> <b>Disposal</b> of Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials (NORM) ". BPF submitted a proposal to the solicitation in July 1994, and was awarded a cooperative agreement in September 1995.

The system would allow BPF to demonstrate an environmentally sound and commercially affordable method for treatment and <b>underground</b> <b>disposal</b> of NORM. The key stop in the BPF process incorporates injection of the dissolved radioactive materials into a water injection or disposal well. Disposal costs in the BPF proposal of July 1995 were projected to range from $ 1000 to $ 5000 per cubic yard. The process included four separate steps.

After mechanical purification and reduction of the solutions/brines mineralization {{in the order of}} 5 million m 3 /year are emitted into surface waters. The studies carried out by Uralkali in 2000 - 2006 at the Verkhnekamskoe field, revealed an opportunity of <b>underground</b> <b>disposal</b> of mineralized brines/wastewater in {{the upper part of the}} salt-marl layer, directly overlapping the salt deposits and situated at depths not exceeding 300 m. Obtained results are confirmed by the state geological commission of the Federal Agency on Mineral Resources. The location of mineralized solutions in reservoir beds with an almost unlimited capacitive potential does not lead to the change in the hydrodynamic and hydrochemical regime of the underground hydrosphere and lessen the burden on the environment. To implement <b>underground</b> <b>disposal</b> of mineralized process brines/wastewater, it is necessary to amend the «Concerning Subsurface Resources» Federal Law.

40|$|Research {{interest}} in the thermo-mechanical behaviour of unsaturated soils is growing {{as a result of}} an increasing number of geomechanical problems involving both thermal and suction effects.

The Bishop effective stress framework is adopted to represent the stress state in the soil in a unified fashion. This constitutive context based on the evolution of two key parameters (the preconsolidation pressure and the suction air-entry value) makes it possible to represent the main features of the thermo-mechanical behaviour of unsaturated soils.
