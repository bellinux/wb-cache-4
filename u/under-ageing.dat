40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} work, {{the effect of}} {{artificial}} ageing of AA 2024 -T 3 on the tensile mechanical properties and fracture toughness degradation due to corrosion exposure will be investigated. Tensile and fracture toughness specimens were artificially aged to tempers that correspond to <b>Under-Ageing</b> (UA), Peak-Ageing (PA) and Over-Ageing (OA) conditions and then were subsequently exposed to exfoliation corrosion environment. The corrosion exposure time was selected {{to be the least}} possible according to the experimental work of Alexopoulos et al. (2016) so as to avoid the formation of large surface pits, trying to simulate the hydrogen embrittlement degradation only. The mechanical test results show that minimum corrosion-induced decrease in elongation at fracture was achieved for the peak-ageing condition, while maximum was noticed at the <b>under-ageing</b> and over-ageing conditions. Yield stress decrease due to corrosion is less sensitive to tempering; fracture toughness decrease was sensitive to ageing heat treatment thus proving that the S΄ particles play a significant role on the corrosion-induced degradation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanical}} {{behavior of}} both, reference and electron beam welded aluminum alloy 6156 specimens was experimentally investigated. Sheets of AA 6156 were artificially aged {{before and after}} the welding process and tensile specimens were machined from the welded sheets according to the ASTM E 8 standard. The specimens were artificially aged at 170 °C for different times that corresponded to all precipitation-hardening conditions, namely <b>under-ageing</b> (UA), peak-ageing (PA) and over-ageing (OA). The results showed that the effect of welding without any heat treatment (condition T 4) decreases by, about 100 MPa, the yield stress and the yield strength, while the remaining elongation at fracture hardly exceeds 4 %. It was also shown that artificial ageing before welding increases the tensile ductility (almost 50 % joint efficiency in deformation) while the artificial ageing post to welding significantly increases the strength properties (more than 75 % joint efficiency in strength) ...|$|E

In this study, lead–radium dating provided valid ages for juvenile to older adult groups, which {{were consistent with the}} counting of otolith growth zones in transverse otolith sections, and longevity estimates exceeding 30 years. Lead–radium dating revealed minor biases between the radiometric age and interpretation of growth zone counting for regional fishing areas monitored by two facilities, Center for Quantitative Fisheries Ecology (CQFE) and the Central Ageing Facility (CAF), using different age estimation techniques. For CQFE, <b>under-ageing</b> of 3. 3 years was observed for individuals with estimated ages under 20 years. For the CAF, ages were overestimated for young fish and underestimated for the oldest fish. Lead–radium dating detected underlying problems in coordinating age estimation between geographically separated fish stocks, and provided a framework to objectively assess otolith interpretation and growth modelling between laboratories based on age-validated data. ...|$|E

New mass media (electronic and print) showed up, {{and many of them}} fell by competition among medias. The phenomena could be seen from the socio-political development which followed the mass media development. The marriage of a rich religious Islamic Teacher from Semarang, Syekh Pujiono Cahyo (43 years old) who married Lutfiana Ulfa, an 11 years 10 months old girl became polemic in our society. Syekh Puji siri marriage was held at August 8 th 2008. The founder and guardian of Miftakhul Jannah Islamic School (Pesantren) Semarang said that he married young girl since he loved small things. A man and an <b>under-age</b> young girl marriage (law and psychological definition) has been happened many times in several Indonesia regions. The story of parents statement, subject, victim, or neighbor at television or radio became fact in society. Almost all young girl who married under ideal age happened in low economic and education family. Generally these girls married with wealthy men (rich or very rich). The research method used survey. According to Kerlinger, Survey method was a research which was done to large and small population, but the data was came from samples taken from the population, so that there found relative events, distributive, and relation between variables (Sugiyono, 1992 : 3). It was quantitative since it described about the influenced of Syekh Puji and Lutfiana Ulfa <b>under-age</b> marriage news. From the research there could be found that society perception to Syekh Puji and Lutfiana Ulfa <b>under-age</b> marriage news according to the frequency of reading Syekh Puji and Lutfiana Ulfa <b>under-age</b> marriage news, seriousness in reading Syekh Puji and Lutfiana Ulfa <b>under-age</b> marriage news, consistency in reading Syekh Puji and Lutfiana Ulfa <b>under-age</b> marriage news, length in reading Syekh Puji and Lutfiana Ulfa <b>under-age</b> marriage news, how often reading Syekh Puji and Lutfiana Ulfa <b>under-age</b> marriage news, trust level to Syekh Puji and Lutfiana Ulfa <b>under-age</b> marriage news, like and dislike in reading Syekh Puji and Lutfiana Ulfa <b>under-age</b> marriage news, people wish in giving respond to Syekh Puji and Lutfiana Ulfa <b>under-age</b> marriage news, there could be concluded that there was positive perception of the Syekh Puji and Lutfiana Ulfa <b>under-age</b> marriage news...|$|R
40|$|Aims: Test-purchasing (using {{volunteers to}} attempt an {{apparent}} <b>under-age</b> purchase) {{can be used}} as an enforcement intervention against retailers who sell alcohol to minors. This article will investigate whether community shopkeepers, familiar with alcohol test-purchasing protocols, are able to distinguish volunteers from genuine <b>under-age</b> customers. Methods: Thirty-six qualitative interviews were conducted with community shopkeepers, the retailers most often associated with <b>under-age</b> sales, working in convenience stores located in socially-contrasting areas of Glasgow, Scotland, 24 of which were licensed to sell alcohol. Findings: Interviewees provided details of the strategies they used to prevent <b>under-age</b> sales. Robust age-verification, set 7. 5 above legal-age of purchase, was felt to be particularly effective. Although, they were apprehensive of test-purchases, experienced retailers reported that they always knew when one was taking place in their shop, because volunteers were not sourced locally and, in contrast to real <b>under-age</b> customers, they were honest and compliant. Conclusions: Although making retailers more aware of their responsibilities, increased familiarity with the protocols of test-purchasing can allow vendors to be certain who real <b>under-age</b> customers are, potentially making low-risk sales to minors possible. Test-purchasing protocols (e. g. volunteers ages) should be re-oriented to keep pace with more robust age-verification checks. </p...|$|R
40|$|The 8090 type Al-Li alloys {{are prone}} to {{intergranular}} and exfoliation corrosion in the peak aged temper. In marine atmosphere exfoliation corrosion occurs within 2 years. The 48 H EXCO test give a good prediction of the corrosion susceptibility of 8090 type alloys in marine atmosphere. <b>Under-ageing</b> and over-ageing are two possibilities to suppress exfoliation susceptibility. Exfoliation corrosion is always intergranular on specimens examined in this study. Intergranular corrosion is usually explained by {{the existence of a}} continuous anodic path at grain boundaries. The anodic path in Al-Li-Cu-Mg alloys is first a Cu depleted zone. Intergranular and exfoliation corrosion only occur in Cu containing Al-Li alloys. The corrosion potential Eo of Al-Li alloys reflect the Cu content in solid solution and is not affected by Li addition. The pitting potential also reflect the Cu content of the solid solution, it is shifted 30 mV in the active direction by Li addition at the PA temper. Li addition prevent intergranular corrosion desensitization observed for 2 XXX AA, in the PA temper...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} carried out to assess the self-healing characteristics of aluminium hybrid composites reinforced primarily with mixed proportion of silica sand and bamboo leaf ash. Charpy impact test samples with 45 ° notch were machined from the aluminium hybrid composites and a ϕ 1 mm hole was drilled at 1 mm away from the notch. Two different self-healing treatments {{were given to the}} test samples prepared from the composites. In the first treatment, a 3 mm diameter hole was drilled along the sample and a low melting point alloy (60 Sn- 40 Pb) which served as secondary reinforcing material was pierced into the hole and then heat treated at a temperature of 250 °C. The second treatment that was adopted involved subjecting the test samples to two-steps <b>under-ageing</b> treatment. The first step involved ageing at 160 °C for 15 minutes and quenched in water. Thereafter, the second ageing treatment {{was carried out}} at 50 °C for 24 h. The samples were then subjected to Charpy impact testing. The results show that the composites had lower absorbed energy compared with Al- Mg-Si alloy. Self-healing treatment improved the energy absorbed in healed samples when compared to the damaged samples. Although, the under-aged samples had a slightly higher absorbed energy in comparison with the samples containing 60 Sn- 40 Pb, the presence of silica sand and bamboo leaf ash did not have significant influence on the absorbed energy. The highest healing efficiency obtained using the low melting point alloy approach was 61 %...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} the {{analyses}} presented below include estimates based on the terminal year value of fishing mortality from the Statistical Catch-at-Age (SCA) model for 2006, F = 0. 31. There are several reasons to regard this estimate with a large grain of salt. These include, first, that past model performance suggests that this estimate for 2006 may decline as additional years of data are added to it (retrospective pattern or bias). To quote the summary from the 2006 stock assessment, "Results from retrospective analysis in the SCA suggest that the 2006 F estimate is likely over-estimated and the SSB estimate is likely under-estimated; therefore, F could decrease and SSB could increase {{with the addition of}} future years of data. " Second, we have evidence suggesting that the MRFSS recreational landings could be increasingly overestimated in recent years. Third, we have accumulating evidence that the mycobacteriosis epidemic could be causing an increase in natural mortality, in contrast to the SCA model assumption that natural mortality is constant. Fourth, recent research on the effect of using otolith ages for older fish in virtual population analysis shows that <b>under-ageing</b> by the use of scale ages causes an over-estimate of fishing mortality, and this could also be true for SCA modeling. Fifth, the tag-recapture estimates of fishing mortality are considerably lower than the SCA estimates for recent years; for 2006, the coastwide average fishing mortality was only 0. 13. Looking at current estimates for earlier years, the SCA estimates are quite similar to those from the tag-recapture models. While the tag-recapture estimates are not exactly comparable to the SCA estimates, because they are for fish greater than 28 ” as opposed to fish of certain ages, they should still be roughly comparable.

Evaluate the effect of a range of percent increases (e. g., 15 %, 20 %, 25 %) in the coastwide [coastal] commercial quota on the fishing mortality rate The two previously reported analyses were revised to include the commercial quota...|$|E

The average {{age at marriage}} of the interviewed women was 14.36, which {{is lower than the}} 18  years of legal age for marriage in Ethiopia (Marshall et al. 2016). <b>Under-age</b> marriage by itself may not directly affect the vulnerability of women to drought or their capacity to adapt; however, it does mean that women give birth to many children at a young age, which in turn restricts their capacity to stay active in extra domestic activities to support their household. Of the interviewed women, 85 % had three children within five years after marriage. <b>Under-age</b> marriage is obviously a problem for the girl being married; however, it is difficult to convince parents against this, because they justify <b>under-age</b> or early marriage as a way for avoiding pre-marital sex and pregnancy outside wedlock (Boyden et al. 2012).|$|R
