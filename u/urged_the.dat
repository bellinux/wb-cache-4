40|$|We model {{economic}} {{decisions as}} stemming from <b>urges.</b> <b>The</b> magnitude of <b>the</b> <b>urge</b> {{is a function}} of previous consumption.

We apply the model to analyze cigarette smoking. Our main results are that, under not implausible conditions, making cigarettes more addictive can reduce smoking and making cigarettes more harmful can improve the average health of the population. ...|$|R
