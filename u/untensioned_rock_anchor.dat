40|$|The Norwegian Public Roads Administration (NPRA) is {{planning}} for an upgrade of the E 39 highway route at the westcoast of Norway. Fixed links shall replace ferries at seven fjord crossings. Wide spans and large depths at the crossings combined with challenging subsea topography and environmental loads {{call for an}} extension of existing practice. A variety of bridge concepts are evaluated in the feasibility study. The structures will experience significant loads from deadweight, traffic and environment. Anchoring of these forces is thus {{one of the challenges}} met in the project. Large-size subsea <b>rock</b> <b>anchors</b> are considered a viable alternative. These can be used for anchoring of floating structures but also with the purpose of increasing capacity of fixed structures. This paper presents first a thorough study of factors affecting <b>rock</b> <b>anchor</b> bond capacity. Laboratory testing of <b>rock</b> <b>anchors</b> subjected to cyclic loading is thereafter presented. Finally, the paper presents a model predicting the capacity of a <b>rock</b> <b>anchor</b> segment, in terms of a ribbed bar, subjected to a cyclic load history. The research assumes a failure mode occurring in the interface between the <b>rock</b> <b>anchor</b> and the surrounding grout. The constitutive behavior of the bonding interface is investigated for anchors subjected to cyclic one-way tensile loads. The model utilizes the static bond capacity curve as a basis, defining the ultimate bond τbu and the slip s 1 at τbu. A limited number of input parameters are required to apply the model. The model defines the bond-slip behavior with the belonging <b>rock</b> <b>anchor</b> capacity depending on the cyclic load level (τmax cy/τbu), the cyclic load ratio (R = τmin cy/τmax cy), and the number of load cycles (N). The constitutive model is intended to model short anchor lengths representing an incremental length of a complete <b>rock</b> <b>anchor...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Rock</b> <b>anchors</b> {{are used}} {{extensively}} in coal mines in the United States {{and around the}} world. The conditions {{in many of these}} coal mines are conducive towards the corrosion of <b>rock</b> <b>anchors.</b> Despite this, very little research has been performed to analyze corrosion and its effects on <b>rock</b> <b>anchors</b> in US coal mines. The specific aim of this thesis is to analyze typical Illinois Coal Basin (ICB) mine parameters and their effects on corrosion. A well understood relationship between these parameters and corrosion would be useful in locating highly corrosive areas and mitigating risks associated with corrosion. To study ICB mine parameters and their effects on corrosion, three general experiment types were carried out: in situ <b>rock</b> <b>anchor</b> analysis, simulated mine environment testing and analysis, and electrochemical testing and analysis. 	For in situ <b>rock</b> <b>anchor</b> analysis, open circuit potential (OCP) of <b>rock</b> <b>anchors</b> in coal mines with various conditions were measured. The OCP values can be used to predict whether or not corrosion of the <b>rock</b> <b>anchors</b> has initiated, and to study relationships between mine parameters and corrosion. The readings were also used to assess the validity of experimental setups by comparing experimental OCP values to in situ mine OCP values. The OCP readings obtained were found to vary by locations within the mines indicating corrosion conditions can vary relative to location. No clear trends were found between the OCP values and moisture or <b>rock</b> <b>anchor</b> age likely indicating numerous other factors were affecting the OCP values. These other significant factors will need to be determined and measured in addition to moisture and age in order to develop clear relationships between mine parameters and OCP values. Overall, the experimental OCP values found were slightly more negative than the in situ OCP values. This may have been {{due to the fact that}} the corrosion tanks exposed the <b>rock</b> <b>anchors</b> to more moisture. It is also a possible indication that mine <b>rock</b> <b>anchors</b> were not yet significantly corroding. 	For simulated environments, three tanks were filled with solution made by adding chloride ions, sulfate ions, and iron ions. The concentrations were based on water samples from mines and were the same for each tank. The temperatures of each tank were set at 30 °C or 50 °C, and the pH levels were set at 5. 5 or 9. The tanks were then loaded with thirteen different types of <b>rock</b> <b>anchors.</b> The solution compositions were monitored over time, and the <b>rock</b> <b>anchors</b> were removed at specified intervals and tested to tensile destruction. The decreasing ultimate strengths of anchors were assumed to be related to the corrosion rate. This relationship was used to study the corrosion rates of multiple <b>rock</b> <b>anchor</b> types in varying conditions. Results seemed to indicate higher temperatures caused the highest corrosion rates. Basic pH levels caused a less significant increase in corrosion. With respect to reduced visible surface corrosion, epoxy coatings were the most effective followed by the proprietary coating, and then the galvanized coating. All bolts, cable anchors, and friction bolts with no coating had significant visible corrosion relative to <b>rock</b> <b>anchors</b> with protective coatings. Cable bolts with no coating and friction bolts seemed to have had the largest decrease in strength, and this is hypothesized to be a result of having larger exposed surface areas than other <b>rock</b> <b>anchor</b> types. 	For electrochemical testing and analysis, potentiodynamic polarization tests were used to estimate the corrosion potential (Ecorr) and corrosion current (Icorr) of <b>rock</b> <b>anchor</b> metals in simulated mine environments. Ecorr can be used as an indication of the conditions necessary for the initiation of corrosion, and Icorr can be used to determine the rate of corrosion. The effects of pyritic sulfur from coal samples in solution, pH of solution, temperature, and the bolt grade on Ecorr and Icorr values were analyzed. No significant trends were observed between electrochemical properties and pyritic sulfur concentrations. pH, temperature, and bolt grade were also parameters that were analyzed, and of these, only temperature had a significant effect on electrochemical properties. The penetration rate increased significantly with respect to increasing temperatures. All corrosion rates in the simulated mine water were considered low according to the standard specifying corrosion rates and characteristics that was used. 	This research has shown mine corrosion parameters are consistent in localized areas. The results, however show additional parameters other than age and moisture must be accounted for in order to accurately predict the risk of corrosion in a given mine. Simulated mine testing results showed that corrosion prevention coatings are effective in reducing corrosion in the conditions tested. Electrochemical test showed corrosion rates were all low in the mine solutions tested. Temperature had the most significant effect on corrosion rates in both the simulated mine tests and electrochemical tests. The electrochemical tests also showed that increased temperature can only simulate increased corrosion periods up to the point that other reaction factors limit the reaction rate independent of temperature. To fully understand corrosion risks in ICB mines, additional parameters and experimental methods should be considered in order to increase the understanding of relationship between ICB mine parameters and corrosion...|$|R

40|$|The mining {{industry}} is a major consumer of rock bolts in the United States. Due to the high humidity in the underground mining environment, the rock bolts corrode and loose their load bearing capacity which in turn reduces the life expectancy of the ground support and, thus, creates operational difficulties and number of safety concerns [1]. Research on <b>rock</b> <b>anchor</b> corrosion has not been adequately extensive {{in the past and}} the effects of several factors in the mine atmosphere and waters are not clearly understood. One of the probable reasons for this lack of research may be attributed to the time required for gathering meaningful data that makes the study of corrosion quite challenging. In this particular work underground water samples from different mines in the Illinois coal basin were collected and the major chemical content was analyzed and used for the laboratory testing. The corrosion performance of the different commercial <b>rock</b> <b>anchors</b> was investigated by techniques such as laboratory immersion tests in five different corrosion chambers, and potentiodynamic polarization tests in simulated ground waters based on the Illinois coal basin. The experiments were conducted with simulate underground mining conditions (corrosive). The tensile strengths were measured for the selected <b>rock</b> <b>anchors</b> taken every 3 months from the salt spray corrosion chambers maintained at different pH values and temperatures. The corrosion potential (Ecorr), corrosion current (Icorr) and the corresponding corrosion rates (CR) of the selected commercial rock bolts: # 5, # 6, # 6 epoxy coated and # 7 forged head rebar steels, # 6 and # 7 threaded head rebar steels were measured at the solution pH values of 5 and 8 at room temperature. The open circuit potential (OCP) values of the different <b>rock</b> <b>anchors</b> were recorded in 3 selected underground coal mines (A, B 2 ̆ 6 C) in the Illinois coal basin and the data compared with the laboratory electrochemical tests for analyzing the life of the <b>rock</b> <b>anchors</b> installed in the mines with respect to corrosion potential and corrosion current measured. The results of this research were statistically validated. This research will have direct consequence to the rock related safety. The results of this research indicate that certain corrosive conditions are commonly found in mines but uniform corrosion (around 0. 01 - 0. 03 mm loss per year across the diameter) is generally not considered a serious issue. From this study, longer term research for long-term excavation support is recommended that could quantify the problem depending on the <b>rock</b> <b>anchor</b> used and specific strata conditions...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{assessment}} of support {{systems such as}} rockbolts and <b>rock</b> <b>anchors</b> are {{very important for the}} maintenance of existing rock-engineering structures. The utilization of non-destructive tests is preferable to destructive tests such as pullout tests. The dynamic responses of <b>rock</b> <b>anchors</b> and rockbolts could be used for non-destructive tests. These tests should generally provide some information on the constructional conditions, corrosion and axial force conditions. In {{the first part of this}} study, some theoretical models are developed for the axial and trasverse dynamic tests and then results of numerical simulations are presented by considering possible conditions in-situ. These conditions are the bonding quality, the existence of corroded parts or couplers and pre-stress. The results of the numerical simulations could be very valuable for interpretation of the wave responses to be measured in non-destructive dynamic tests in-situ. ...|$|R

The maximal shear stresses {{on the interface}} {{in front of the}} bearing plate are determined based on tests. The relation of maximal shear stress and fixed anchor length is assumed.

According to the results of the field test, the values range of the parameters in soft rock is determined. After comparing ultimate {{bearing capacity}} measured in test with predicting value, it is shown that the empirical formula can calculate the bearing capacity of fixed anchor length reasonably.

40|$|AbstractHigh-capacity, {{post-tensioned}} anchors {{have found}} wide-spread use, originally in initial dam design and construction, {{and more recently}} in the strengthening and rehabilitation of concrete dams to meet modern design and safety standards. Despite the advances {{that have been made}} in rock mechanics and rock engineering during the last 80 years in which post-tensioned anchors have been used in dam engineering, some aspects of the rock engineering design of high-capacity <b>rock</b> <b>anchors</b> for dams have changed relatively little over the last 30 or 40 years. This applies, in particular, to the calculations usually carried out to establish the grouted embedment lengths required for deep, post-tensioned anchors. These calculations usually make simplified assumptions about the distribution and values of rock–grout interface shear strengths, the shape of the volume of rock likely to be involved in uplift failure under the influence of a system of post-tensioned anchors, and the mechanism of that failure. The resulting designs are generally conservative. It is concluded that these aspects of the rock engineering design of large, post-tensioned <b>rock</b> <b>anchors</b> for dams can be significantly improved by making greater use of modern, comprehensive, numerical analyses in conjunction with three-dimensional (3 D) models of the rock mass structure, realistic rock and rock mass properties, and the results of prototype anchor tests in the rock mass concerned...|$|R
40|$|Most of {{the world}} 2 ̆ 7 s coral reefs line the coasts of {{developing}} nations, where impacts from intense and destructive fishing practices form critical conservation issues for managers. Overfishing of herbivorous fishes can cause phase shifts to macroalgal dominance, and fishers 2 ̆ 7 use of <b>rocks</b> as <b>anchors</b> lowers coral cover, giving further competitive advantage to macroalgae. Overfishing and anchoring have been studied extensively, but the role of their interaction in lowering coral reef resilience has not been quantified formally. We analyzed the combined effects of overfishing and <b>rock</b> <b>anchoring</b> {{on a range of}} reef habitat types-varying from high coral and low macroalgae cover to low coral and high macroalgae cover-in a marine park in Indonesia. We parameterized a model of coral and algal dynamics with three intensities of anchoring and fishing pressure. Results of the model indicated that damage caused by <b>rock</b> <b>anchoring</b> was equal to or possibly more devastating to coral reefs in the area than the impact of overfishing. This is an important outcome for local managers, who usually have the funds to distribute less-damaging anchors, but normally are unable to patrol regularly and effectively enough to reduce the impact of overfishing. We translated model results into an interactive visual tool that allows managers to explore the benefits of reducing anchoring frequency and fishing pressure. The potential consequences of inaction were made clear: the likelihood that any of the reef habitats will be dominated in the future by macroalgae rather than corals depends on reducing anchoring frequency, fishing pressure, or both. The tool provides a platform for strengthened relationships between managers and conservationists and can facilitate the uptake of recommendations regarding resource allocation and management actions. Conservation efforts for coral reefs in developing nations are likely to benefit from transforming model projections of habitat condition into tools local managers can understand and interact with...|$|R

First, a corrosion degradation model for reinforcing steel bars in concrete is selected to model the uniform corrosion of rock bolts.

Finally, {{an example of an}} <b>anchored</b> <b>rock</b> slope is worked out {{to investigate}} the effect of rock bolt corrosion on the time-dependent reliability of the <b>anchored</b> <b>rock</b> slope.

The system probability of failure of the <b>anchored</b> <b>rock</b> slope decreases with increasing thickness of bolt cover and increases with increasing water-cement ratio of the grout. During the design and construction of pre-stressed rock bolts, a certain thickness of bolt cover should be guaranteed and the water-cement ratio of the grout should be strictly controlled to enhance the long-term stabilization effect of rock bolts.

The rock slopes are composed of a heavily jointed rock mass and the spacing, dip and dip direction of joint sets are varying at different locations. Geological mapping was carried out to characterize all discontinuities present along the slopes. Laboratory and field investigations were conducted to assess the geotechnical properties of the intact rock, rock mass and joint infill. Stability analyses of these rock slopes were carried out using numerical programmes. Loads from the foundations resting on the slopes and seismic accelerations estimated from site-specific ground response analysis were considered. The proposed slope profile with several berms between successive foundations was simulated in the numerical model. An equivalent continuum approach with Hoek and Brown failure criterion was initially used in a finite element model to assess the global stability of the slope abutments.
