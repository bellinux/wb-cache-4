5|$|Chromium metal left {{standing}} in air is passivated by oxidation, forming a thin, protective, surface layer. This layer is a spinel structure {{only a few}} molecules thick. It is very dense, and prevents the diffusion of oxygen into the <b>underlying</b> <b>metal.</b> This {{is different from the}} oxide that forms on iron and carbon steel, through which elemental oxygen continues to migrate, reaching the underlying material to cause incessant rusting. Passivation can be enhanced by short contact with oxidizing acids like nitric acid. Passivated chromium is stable against acids. Passivation can be removed with a strong reducing agent that destroys the protective oxide layer on the metal. Chromium metal treated in this way readily dissolves in weak acids.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{does not}} react with water, {{but it does}} slowly react with {{atmospheric}} oxygen to form a layer of brown-black copper oxide which, unlike the rust that forms on iron in moist air, protects the <b>underlying</b> <b>metal</b> from further corrosion (passivation). A green layer of verdigris (copper carbonate) can often be seen on old copper structures, such as the roofing of many older buildings and the Statue of Liberty. Copper tarnishes when exposed to some sulfur compounds, with which it reacts to form various copper sulfides.|$|E
5|$|The metal's {{distinctive}} natural green patina {{has long}} been coveted by architects and designers. The final patina is a particularly durable layer that is highly resistant to atmospheric corrosion, thereby protecting the <b>underlying</b> <b>metal</b> against further weathering. It can be a mixture of carbonate and sulfate compounds in various amounts, depending upon environmental conditions such as sulfur-containing acid rain. Architectural copper and its alloys can also be 'finished' to embark a particular look, feel, and/or color. Finishes include mechanical surface treatments, chemical coloring, and coatings.|$|E

Presented with solubility details from similar sets of constitutional diagrams, can one expect artificial neural networks (ANN), which are blind to the <b>underlying</b> <b>metals</b> physics, to reveal similar or better correlations? The aim is to test whether it is feasible to predict solid solubility limits using ANN with the parameters that Hume-Rothery identified. The {{results indicate that the}} correlations expected by Hume-Rothery’s Rules work best for a certain range of copper or silver alloy systems. The ANN can predict a value for solubility, which is a refinement on the original qualitative duties of Hume-Rothery’s Rules.

40|$|Some of the physico-electrochemical {{properties}} of passive oxide films that form on reactive metal and alloy surfaces, and which protect the <b>underlying</b> <b>metals</b> from reaction with corrosive environments, are reviewed {{within the context}} of the Point Defect Model (PDM). This model yields analytical expressions for the steady state current and film thickness and for the transients in these properties that can be used to predict deterministically the accumulation of general corrosion damage to metal surfaces, provided that the evolutionary path to the future state is continuous and can be specified. The conditions under which passivity may exist are defined in terms of Phase Space Analysis (PSA) of the PDM and it is found that passivity is invariably a meta-stable phenomenon. PSA leads to the development of Kinetic Stability Diagrams (KSDs) as alternatives to the equilibrium thermodynamic Pourbaix diagrams that are now used to describe the conditions under which passivity is observed...|$|R
25|$|Often it is {{possible}} to chemically remove the products of corrosion. For example, phosphoric acid in the form of naval jelly is often applied to ferrous tools or surfaces to remove rust. Corrosion removal {{should not be confused with}} electropolishing, which removes some layers of the <b>underlying</b> <b>metal</b> to make a smooth surface. For example, phosphoric acid may also be used to electropolish copper but it does this by removing copper, not the products of copper corrosion.|$|E
25|$|The copper patinas {{are very}} thin: just 0.05080–0.07620millimeters in thickness. Yet, {{they are highly}} {{adherent}} to the underlying copper metal. The initial and intermediate oxide and sulfide patina films are not particularly corrosion resistant. The final sulfate patina is a particularly durable layer that is highly resistant to all forms of atmospheric corrosion and protects the <b>underlying</b> <b>metal</b> against further weathering. As patination progresses and the durable sulfate layer forms, the rate of corrosion decreases, averaging between 0.0001–0.0003millimeters per year. For a 0.6millimeter-thick sheet, this equates to less than 5% corrosion {{over a period of}} 100 years. Further information is available on copper patination.|$|E
25|$|Passivation {{refers to}} the {{spontaneous}} formation of an ultrathin film of corrosion products, known as a passive film, on the metal's surface that act {{as a barrier to}} further oxidation. The chemical composition and microstructure of a passive film are different from the <b>underlying</b> <b>metal.</b> Typical passive film thickness on aluminium, stainless steels, and alloys is within 10 nanometers. The passive film is different from oxide layers that are formed upon heating and are in the micrometer thickness range – the passive film recovers if removed or damaged whereas the oxide layer does not. Passivation in natural environments such as air, water and soil at moderate pH is seen in such materials as aluminium, stainless steel, titanium, and silicon.|$|E
5000|$|Silver-gilt or gilded/gilt silver, {{sometimes}} {{known in}} American English by the French term vermeil, is silver (either pure or sterling) {{which has been}} gilded with gold. Most large objects made in goldsmithing {{that appear to be}} gold are actually silver-gilt; for example most sporting trophies (including medals such as the gold medals awarded in all Olympic Games after 1912) and many crown jewels are silver-gilt objects. Apart from the raw materials being much less expensive to acquire than solid gold of any karat, large silver-gilt objects are also noticeably lighter if lifted, as well as more durable (gold is about as heavy as lead and is highly malleable/ easily scratched). Compared to objects made of ungilded sterling silver which have intricate detail like monstrances, gilding, which limits oxidation of the <b>underlying</b> <b>metals,</b> greatly reduces the need for cleaning and polishing, and so reduces the risk of damage to them. The [...] "gold" [...] threads used in embroidered goldwork are normally also silver-gilt.|$|R

40|$|Controlled {{motion of}} {{graphene}} and graphene oxide nanoflakes {{in a thin}} liquid film on metal surfaces was studied to unravel the significant variations of the electric field effects on the nanoparticles. It was found that graphene oxide flakes were negatively charged and migrated toward anode while the electrically neutral graphene flakes moved toward cathode. Therefore, thin layers of graphene as a protective coating were produced to inhibit corrosion of <b>underlying</b> <b>metals</b> and reduce friction and wear-related mechanical failures in moving mechanical systems. The method does not require an insulated substrate to confine the high electric field to the fluidic layer. The motion of the nano-particles under pulsed electric current was very efficient. The observed effects were interpreted in a possible mechanism associated {{to the effect of}} electric field on the mobility of different particles in different conductive media. This significant phenomenon, combined with unique properties of graphene and graphene oxides, represents an exciting platform for enabling diverse applications on the preparation of protective coatings on an arbitrary conductive substrate over large areas...|$|R
25|$|Some common metals oxidize {{extremely}} {{rapidly in}} air. Titanium and aluminium oxidize instantaneously {{in contact with}} the oxygen in the air. These metals form an extremely thin layer of oxidized metal on the surface which bonds with the <b>underlying</b> <b>metal.</b> This thin layer of oxide protects the underlying layers of the metal from the air preventing the entire metal from oxidizing. These metals are used in applications where corrosion resistance is important. Iron, in contrast, has an oxide that forms in air and water, called rust, that does not bond with the iron and therefore does not stop the further oxidation of the iron. Thus iron left exposed to air and water will continue to rust until all of the iron is oxided.|$|E
50|$|Flow-accelerated {{corrosion}} (FAC), {{also known}} as flow-assisted corrosion, is a corrosion mechanism in which a normally protective oxide layer on a metal surface dissolves in a fast flowing water.

5000|$|The {{silver and}} gold {{that was used to}} make King Philip II’s diadem would have {{originally}} been mined, processed, and then shipped to a jeweler or expert artisan. During the first millennium B.C. the region around the Balkans and Greece was famed for its precious metals. [...] During this period, most objects were cast in a lost wax process. The lost wax process involves creating a mold with an object made out of wax, the object being an identical rendering of what the finished product should look like. Once the wax is formed it is incased in clay and then baked. While baking, the wax will melt leaving the artisan with a mold. With a completed mold the artisan would be able to fill it with the metals they wished to use. [...] The gilding process that most likely would have been used on this diadem would have involved gold leaf being burnished to the silver. The adhesion of gold with the use of heat helps promote interdiffusion with the <b>underlying</b> <b>metals</b> which usually consist silver or copper.|$|R
40|$|Pits {{are found}} to {{nucleate}} on solid gal l ium in buffered chloride solutions, and we propose that the pits nucleate f rom blisters that fo rm beneath the passive film on the metal substrate. The proposed association of pitting with blister forma-tion is {{accounted for by the}} point defect mode l for the growth and breakdown of passive films, and has been tested by compar ing the behaviors of solid and liquid gal l ium upon anodic polarization in chloride-containing environments. This study shows that liquid gal l ium resists passivity b reakdown much more readily than does the solid, wh ich we attribute to the inhibition of cation vacancy condensation, in liquid substrate, and hence to the formation of blister precursors at the metal/fi lm interface. Thus, solid gall ium is added to the growing list of metals and alleys that apparently suffer passivity b reakdown via a vacancy condensate precursor.

40|$|The {{chloride}} ion (Cl-) {{is known as}} an aggressive species in the aqueous solutions that adsorbs to the imperfect sites on the metal surfaces, such as defects, impurities and second-phase particles. This adsorption process could change the chemical composition and properties, such as ion conductivity, of the passive film. As a result, the passive film becomes less protective and breaks down at some places where the <b>underlying</b> <b>metals</b> {{are exposed to the}} electrolyte and dissolved through anodic reaction forming a pit. In the meantime, the hydrolysis (cathodic reaction) occurs inside the pit giving rise to a lower pH and leading to an increased dissolution rate of the metals. Subsequently, more {{chloride ion}}s migrate into the pit in order to maintain electrical neutrality and adsorb onto the pit surface. The repeating of such process causes the pitting propagation. However, anodic polarization allows the chloride ions to migrate into the passive film more easily. With growth of the pit, more corrosion products make both in plane diffusion across the sample surface and out-of-plane diffusion to bulk solution from the pit mouth [M. G. Fontana, N. D.

However, comparison with previous results obtained for monolayers formed on Au and Cu films showed that the resistances of conducting C 60 monolayers do not show a simple dependence on the transferred charge.

30|$|The first {{metal layer}} on the substrate, {{referred}} to as contact layer, should have a low work function and good adhesion to the substrate. Moreover, it may also block the diffusion of upper layer metals with large work functions into the substrate. Presently, Ti is the principal metal as contact layer to β-Ga 2 O 3 because of its low function (4.33  eV) and good adhesion to the substrate. Besides, the formation of Ti 2 O 3 and Ti 3 O 5 with lower work functions than Ti at the interface is favored in forming Ohmic contacts since the oxides reduce the SBH and leave behind oxygen vacancies acting as donors. However, other metals with low work functions including Ta (3.1  eV) and Hf (3.9  eV) have not been explored yet. The second overlayer with a low work function {{should be able to}} form intermetallic compounds with the contact layer to prevent their diffusion into the interface. Presently, Al is used as the overlayer since it can meet these requirements. The third metal layer (barrier layer) serves the purpose of limiting the in-diffusion of the upper metal layer and out-diffusion of lower metal layers [70, 71]. Ni is the most commonly used barrier layer for β-Ga 2 O 3. There are other good candidates like Mo, Nb, and Ir with high melting points to substitute Ni which are expected to have lower reactivity and solubility for Au than Ni [72 – 75]. The fourth cap layer acts as a protective layer to prevent or minimize the oxidation of <b>underlying</b> <b>metals.</b> Practically, Au is commonly employed to serve this purpose.|$|R

50|$|Galvanization {{consists}} of an application on the object to be protected of a layer of metallic zinc by either hot-dip galvanizing or electroplating. Zinc is traditionally used because it is cheap, adheres well to steel, and provides cathodic protection to the steel surface in case of damage of the zinc layer. In more corrosive environments (such as salt water), cadmium plating is preferred. Galvanization often fails at seams, holes, and joints where there are gaps in the coating. In these cases, the coating still provides some partial cathodic protection to iron, by acting as a galvanic anode and corroding itself instead of the <b>underlying</b> protected <b>metal.</b> The protective zinc layer is consumed by this action, and thus galvanization provides protection only for a limited period of time.|$|R

40|$|Flat panel {{displays}} {{based on}} electron field emission {{can provide the}} benefits of the high resolution of a cathode ray tube display while possessing the portability of a liquid crystal display. To date, the problem with a field emission flat panel display based on silicon is that it usually involves complex photolithography processing, making it too complex and expensive to be commercially viable. In this thesis, the emphasis of the research is to fabricate a three terminal silicon device for flat panel display based on field emission technology without using photolithography processes. Laser crystallised amorphous silicon is chosen for our material which creates a rough silicon surface whose roughness gives rise to field enhancement. Furthermore, this process is widely used in the display industry to fabricate silicon based display driver thin film transistors, which can be readily incorporated. It is important to understand the electron field emission mechanism from the laser crystallised amorphous silicon and to find optimum conditions for emission. In the course of our research, we established a regime for super sequential lateral growth or a hybrid sequential lateral solidification and super lateral growth in Nd:YAG crystallisation of amorphous silicon. Excimer laser crystallised amorphous silicon under optimum conditions gives emission currents of the order of 10 - 5 A (current densities ~ 0. 04 A/cm 2) at threshold fields less than 15 V/mum in a diode configuration, without the need for a forming process. Through experiments, we concluded that the field emission mechanism from these samples is not controlled purely by surface phenomena, contrary to what was suggested by the Fowler Nordheim theory. Instead, it is the diffusion of the <b>underlay</b> <b>metals</b> into the silicon that create clusters of silicide that allow the electrons to become "hot" while travelling between the clusters. Lastly, a novel process illustrating that a three-terminal device based on laser crystallised amorphous silicon can be fabricated without the need for photolithography. However, the field emission data showed that some fine-tuning of the process is still required...|$|R
