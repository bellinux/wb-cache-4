50|$|A {{dashboard}} {{with digital}} readouts <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>speedometer,</b> tachometer, odometer, temperature, oil pressure, voltage, and fuel.|$|R
50|$|Around 1896 Stewart and Clark {{founded the}} Sterk Manufacturing Company which {{produced}} speedometers and automobile horns. The flexible shafts from the Chicago Flexible Shaft Company {{were used in}} the production of cables needed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>speedometers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{dashboard}} {{retains its}} instrument layout, but adds a new instrument binnacle on <b>the</b> steering column <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>speedometer,</b> tachometer, and fuel gauge. The central instrument display now houses a four-line TFT display with {{the option to}} upgrade to an 8.8 inch screen for navigation and infotainment functions.|$|R
2500|$|Most {{instruments}} and controls on a dashboard in modern vehicles are illuminated when the headlamps are turned on, {{and the intensity}} of light can be adjusted by <b>the</b> driver <b>for</b> comfort. Saab automobiles, for example, have an aircraft-style [...] "night panel" [...] function which shuts off all interior illumination save <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>speedometer</b> (unless attention is called to a critical situation on another gauge) to improve the driver's night vision.|$|R
50|$|Inside, {{a revised}} {{instrument}} panel featured two round pods <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>speedometer</b> and other instruments, replacing <b>the</b> horizontal sweep <b>speedometer</b> of 1964-65 models, {{but the rest}} of the basic dashboard designed was unchanged. F-85 models had base interiors with bench seats and rubber floor mats while the more lavish Cutlass versions came with full carpeting and featured Strato bucket seats of a new design with higher and thinner seat backs, or a no-cost bench seat option. Head rests were a $52 option.|$|R
50|$|Aside {{from the}} dashboard, the {{interior}} was also shared with the Mark IV. Instead of the square gauges used by Lincoln, Thunderbirds used round dials <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>speedometer,</b> fuel gauge, and clock. To the driver’s left were the climate control controls and the light controls; to the right were the radio controls, wiper controls, and information center. This dash layout would remain through the 1989 model year. Base price was $5,293 {{and a total of}} 57,814 Thunderbirds were built <b>for</b> <b>the</b> model year.|$|R

5000|$|Another Saab feature was the [...] "Night Panel", which {{permitted}} dousing of {{the instrument}} panel lighting, except for essential information, for less distraction when driving at night. Once the night panel button (located by the stereo and caution lights) has been activated, the instrument cluster will dim except <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>speedometer,</b> which will illuminate from 0-87 mph, until 87 has been exceeded. As a gauge becomes a necessity <b>for</b> <b>the</b> driver's attention, it will illuminate (<b>for</b> example, if <b>the</b> car needs to be refueled, if the engine is overheating, etc.) ...|$|R
5000|$|The F-4EAT was a 4-speed, {{electronically}} controlled {{automatic transmission}} developed by Mazda and JATCO starting in 1990. It was also later produced by Ford Motor Company from 1991 to 2003, {{to replace the}} aging, 3-speed/hydraulic controlled ATX. It {{is referred to as}} the F4A-EL by Mazda and Kia who also used this transmission. This transmission is an updated Mazda F3A transmission, 3 speed hydraulic controlled transmission. The F-4EAT uses electronic, computer controls, a 4th gear overdrive, has a lock up torque converter and differential. It used a computer-controlled speed sensor <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>speedometer.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Regular fourth {{generation}} production began on January 3, 1983; the 1984 model year and delivery to customers began in March 1983. The 1984 model carried over the [...] L83 slightly more powerful (5bhp) [...] "Crossfire" [...] V8 engine {{from the final}} 1982 third generation model. New chassis features were aluminum brake calipers and an all-aluminum suspension for weight savings and rigidity. The new one piece targa top had no center reinforcement. A new electronic dashboard with digital liquid crystal displays <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>speedometer</b> and tachometer was standard. Beginning in 1985, the [...] L98 engine with tuned port fuel injection became the standard engine.|$|R
50|$|Edward Turner {{designed}} Triumph's sprung hub in 1938. The {{design was}} inspired by Dowty hubs with suspension within them, as used in the fixed landing gear of Gloster Gladiator fighter aircraft. Turner's design used a plunger-type suspension made {{small enough to fit}} inside the wheel hub. With one spring above the rear axle and two below, the sprung hub provided about two inches of vertical travel and weighed 17 lb more than a conventional hub. It was designed to allow rear suspension to be offered optionally without altering Triumph's existing frames. The sprung hub did not provide a drive gear <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>speedometer,</b> so <b>the</b> design of the transmission was revised to provide the required drive gear.|$|R
5000|$|The Dyna Junior was {{characterized}} by simple lines and few frills. Exterior decoration {{was limited to the}} grille inherited from the Dyna X. The car had exposed hinges on the trailing edge of the two passenger doors that opened [...] "Suicide"-style. There were no external door handles, so opening the door required reaching in through the sliding plastic side windows to reach the interior latch. There was likewise no external trunk lid, with the rear storage compartment accessed by folding down the backrest of the two-place bench-seat. The interior was spartan, with a single centre-mounted dial <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>speedometer</b> and a gearshift lever sprouting from the dashboard as in the Dyna X.|$|R
50|$|<b>For</b> 2010, <b>the</b> Sentra {{received}} a mid-cycle refresh. It revisions included a new, Altima-inspired grille, a revised lower fascia and slightly different headlights. In back, new taillights (though {{almost identical to}} previous years) and additional chrome trim pieces on the trunk and side moldings highlight the major changes. New trimlines are offered to balance out the prices. Inside is a new red back-lighting color <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>speedometer</b> and knobs, and a new CD player with an optional navigation system. The new audio system includes iPod and USB integration on certain models, {{as well as a}} backup camera. Fog lamps are no longer standard on the 2.0S and SL model and leather seats are now only available as an option rather than standard on <b>the</b> SL model <b>for</b> 2010, which is reflected in the new, lower MSRP. The Brazilian export variant features a flexible fuel engine and retractable side mirrors were adopted from the Nissan Versa.|$|R

50|$|The {{interior}} had cloth {{bench seats}} and a metal dash sometimes with a simulated burle woodgrain. The radio {{was a simple}} mono vacuum tube type radio with integrated speaker. An ash tray was located in {{the right side of}} the dash, close to the clock Depending upon the year there were both choke and throttle cables on the dash. On the right side was the choke lever. In the earlier years the clock was integrated into the glove compartment door and was of a manual-wind seven-day type. In the 1949 and 1950 models the clock was next to the glove box and with the redesigned dash board, the clock was on the top of the dash, in a center pod. Also, this revised dash had two round pods <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>speedometer</b> and <b>the</b> other gauges while the 1949 and 1950 models had one large round pod directly in front of the steering wheel on the dash.|$|R
