It maps well to general-processing theories such as weak central coherence theory, which hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in ASD.

50|$|Parkinson's {{disease is}} a {{neurodegenerative}} disease affecting the substantia nigra, {{a component of the}} basal ganglia. The substantia nigra has a high quantity of dopaminergic neurons, which are nerve cells that release the neurotransmitter known as dopamine. When dopamine is released, it may activate dopamine receptors in the striatum, which is another component of the basal ganglia. When neurons of the substantia nigra deteriorate in Parkinson's disease, the striatum no longer properly receives dopamine signals. As a result, the basal ganglia can no longer regulate body movement effectively and motor function becomes impaired. By acting as an agonist for the D2, D3, and D4 dopamine receptors, pramipexole may directly stimulate the <b>underfunctioning</b> dopamine receptors in the striatum, thereby restoring the dopamine signals needed for proper functioning of the basal ganglia.|$|E
40|$|Diabetes {{has emerged}} as a major public health concern in {{developing}} nations. Health systems in most developing countries are yet to integrate effective prevention and control programs for diabetes into routine health care services. Given the inadequate human resources and <b>underfunctioning</b> health systems, we need novel and innovative approaches to combat diabetes in developing-country settings. In this regard, the tremendous advances in telecommunication technology, particularly cell phones, can be harnessed to improve diabetes care. Cell phones could serve as a tool for collecting information on surveillance, service delivery, evidence-based care, management, and supply systems pertaining to diabetes from primary care settings in addition to providing health messages as part of diabetes education. As a screening/diagnostic tool for diabetes, cell phones can aid the health workers in undertaking screening and diagnostic and follow-up care for diabetes in the community. Cell phones are also capable of acting as a vehicle for continuing medical education; a decision support system for evidence-based management; and a tool for patient education, self-management, and compliance. However, for widespread use, we need robust evaluations of cell phone applications in existing practices and appropriate interventions in diabetes...|$|E
40|$|D-Serine (DSR) is an {{endogenous}} {{amino acid}} involved in glia-synapse interactions that has unique neurotransmitter characteristics. DSR acts as obligatory coagonist at the glycine site {{associated with the}} N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of glutamate receptors (NMDAR) and has a cardinal modulatory role in major NMDAR-dependent processes including NMDAR-mediated neurotransmission, neurotoxicity, synaptic plasticity, and cell migration. Since either over- or <b>underfunction</b> of NMDARs {{may be involved in}} the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders; the pharmacological manipulation of DSR signaling represents a major drug development target. A first generation of proof-of-concept animal and clinical studies suggest beneficial DSR effects in treatment-refractory schizophrenia, movement, depression, and anxiety disorders and for the improvement of cognitive performance. A related developing pharmacological strategy is the indirect modification of DSR synaptic levels by use of compounds that alter the function of main enzymes responsible for DSR production and degradation. Accumulating data indicate that, during the next decade, we will witness important advances in the understanding of DSR role that will further contribute to elucidating the causes of neuropsychiatric disorders and will be instrumental in the development of innovative treatments...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} review, an {{attempt was made}} to {{describe}} current knowledge and concepts concerning the complex relationships that link thyroid autoimmunity (TAI) and hypothyroidism with female and male infertility, as well as abnormalities occurring during pregnancy, such as pregnancy loss and maternal and fetal repercussions associated with hypothyroidism. In the case of infertility, although the clinical relevance of TAI is somewhat controversial, when all available information is considered the results strongly suggest that when infertility is due to well-de®ned female causes, autoimmunity is involved and TAI constitutes a useful marker of the underlying immune abnormality, independently of thyroid function disorders. In the case of pregnancy loss, the vast majority of available studies clearly establish that TAI (even with no overt thyroid dysfunction) is associated with a signi®cant increase in miscarriage risk. To ®nd an association, however, does not imply a causal relationship, and the aetiology of increased pregnancy loss associated with TAI remains presently not completely understood. With regard to maternal repercussions during gestation, the main risk associated with TAI is the occurrence of hypothyroidism and obstetric complications (premature birth, pre-eclampsia, etc.). Thus, systematic screening of TAI and hypothyroidism during early pregnancy, monitoring of thyroid function with/without L-thyroxine treatment and follow-up during post-partum have proved helpful and important in order to manage these patients adequately. Finally, with regard to potential repercussions affecting the offspring, recent evidence suggests that thyroid maternal <b>underfunction,</b> eve...|$|R
40|$|The {{extent and}} {{direction}} of movement of removable partial dentures during function {{are influenced by the}} nature of supporting structures and the design of the prosthesis since forces are transmitted to abutment teeth by rest, guide planes, and direct retainers during functional movements. Because of the lack of tooth support distally, the denture base will have tissueward <b>underfunction</b> proportionate to the quality (displaceability) of the supporting soft tissue, the accuracy of the denture base, and the total occlusal load applied. The movement of the base under function determines the occlusal efficiency of the partial denture {{and the degree to which}} the abutment teeth are subjected to torque and tipping stresses. The purpose of this study is to know the functional load exerts with RPI and RPL direct retainer in bilateral distal extension. This study is a laboratory experiment employing samples of 5 frames using RPI and 5 frames using RPL direct retainer design. Testing was conducted by Vishay Teaching Polariscope type 080. The result was noted and analyzed statistically using ANOVA. The result of this study indicates that F calculation value for frame with RPI and RPL direct retainer design is 5, 35 and 6, 11 Mpa; F calculation for the occlusal load distribution on first premolar and edentulous area is 276, 90 Mpa and 171, 53 Mpa; F calculation for occlusal load distribution on first premolar and edentulous area employing RPI and RPL direct retainer design is 9, 17 and 11, 96 Mpa. This statistical calculation shows that there is a significant difference between RPI and RPL direct retainer design, the occlusal load concentrated at edentulous area either RPI or RPL direct retainer, and the occlusal load distribution between the first premolar and edentulous area are more uniform on RPI direct retainer design...|$|R
40|$|Youth with {{attention}} deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have deficits in interference inhibition, which can be improved with the indirect catecholamine agonist methylphenidate (MPH). Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to investigate the effects of a single dose of MPH on brain activation during interference inhibition in medication-naı̈ve ADHD boys. Medication-naı̈ve boys with ADHD were scanned twice, in a randomized, double-blind design, under either a single clinical dose of MPH or placebo, while performing a Simon task that measures interference inhibition and controls for the oddball effect of low-frequency appearance of incongruent trials. Brain activation was compared within patients under either drug condition. To test for potential normalization effects of MPH, brain activation in ADHD patients under either drug condition was compared with that of healthy age-matched comparison boys. During incongruent trials compared with congruent–oddball trials, boys with ADHD under placebo relative to controls showed reduced brain activation in typical areas of interference inhibition, including right inferior prefrontal cortex, left striatum and thalamus, mid-cingulate/supplementary motor area, and left superior temporal lobe. MPH relative to placebo upregulated brain activation in right inferior prefrontal and premotor cortices. Under the MPH condition, patients relative to controls no longer showed the reduced activation in right inferior prefrontal and striato-thalamic regions. Effect size comparison, furthermore, showed that these normalization effects were significant. MPH significantly normalized the fronto-striatal <b>underfunctioning</b> in ADHD patients relative to controls during interference inhibition, but did not affect medial frontal or temporal dysfunction.
