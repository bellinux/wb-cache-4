40|$|We {{propose a}} new method for {{personalized}} webpage recommendation. The method {{is capable of}} inferring a <b>user’s</b> personal <b>reading</b> interest distribution according to implicit user feedbacks coming from the <b>user’s</b> past online <b>reading</b> activities. With the inferred <b>user</b> <b>reading</b> interest distribution, we can recommend webpages in a search result set to a user in a personalized way. Our method is featured by its novel approach to observe the facial expressions and gaze positions of a user during the <b>user’s</b> online <b>reading</b> activities as two types of implicit user feedbacks for estimating the <b>user’s</b> <b>reading</b> interest distribution. To capture these implicit user feedbacks, we use an ordinary web camera and a customized web browser in the setup. The setup allows us to measure {{the distribution of the}} <b>reading</b> time a <b>user</b> spends in his or her reading activities over materials of different contents. With all the captured information, our method then estimates a <b>user’s</b> <b>reading</b> interest distribution by finding correlations between the implicit feedbacks of a user with the contents of the read materials. Given the estimated <b>user</b> <b>reading</b> interest distribution, our algorithm can further predict the <b>user’s</b> potential <b>reading</b> interest in any new webpage. Consequently, our algorithm can produce a personalized webpage recommendation for all the result webpages in an online search session. We compared the performance of our method with that of several mainstream commercial search engines as well as a recent personalized webpage ranking algorithm. The comparison results clearly show the superiority of our new method for personalized webpage recommendation...|$|R

(2008) {{present a}} {{framework}} for interactive narrative authoring {{in the domain of}} virtual storytelling where a user is provided with navigation choices in an interactive narrative. The framework is based on a generalised concept of a section, which is close to a subject in our description. A subject consists of hierarchically structured fragments (a statement in our description). A statement is defined as an atomic content element containing simple text and possibly other media. A statement may also be composed recursively and consist of a set of statements, a behaviour and a termination property. Behaviour can be set by an author as either deterministic to indicate that a <b>user</b> <b>reads</b> in the order of subjects or as non-deterministic to indicate that a <b>user</b> <b>reads</b> with no predefined order. A termination property is a condition that an author sets to determine when a subject terminates. A user then moves on to a following subject. A <b>user</b> <b>reads</b> an interactive narrative created in this framework by successively accessing statements in a subject.|$|R

We predict that implementation of our policy on the existing LFS would improve the degree of user satisfaction with the file system. 1 Introduction. A recent innovation in file system technology was the notion of a log structured file system [RO 92]. It was argued that such file systems would capitalize more effectively on the improvement in hardware technologies both in the near and not-so-near future. The basis for such an argument was two-fold: first, that memory was getting both cheaper and more plentiful, and second, that the relative speed of the CPU was increasing with respect to [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Vocabulary is {{the first}} hurdle for English {{learners}} to over- come. Instead of simply showing a word again and again {{we come up with}} an idea to develop an English news article search engine based on users word-reciting record on Shanbay. com. It is designed for advanced English learners to find suitable reading materials. The search engine consists of Crawling Module Document Normalizing module Indexing Module Querying Module and Interface Module. We propose three sorting amp ranking algorithms for Querying Module. For the basic algorithm five crucial principles are taken into consideration. Term frequency inverse document frequency familiarity degree and article freshness degree are factors in this algorithm. Then we think of a improved algorithm for the scene in which a <b>user</b> <b>read</b> multiple articles in the searching result list. Here we adopt a iterative amp greedy method. The essential idea is to select English news articles one by one according to the query meanwhile dynamically update the unfamiliarity of the words during each iterative step. Moreover we develop an advanced algorithm to take article difficulty in to account. Interface Module is designed as a website meanwhile some data visualization technologies e. g. word cloud are applied here. Furthermore we conduct both applicability check and performance evaluation. Metrics such as searching time word-covering ratio and minimum number of articles that completely cover all the queried vocabulary are randomly sampled and profoundly analyzed. The result shows that our search engine works very well with satisfying performance...|$|E
40|$|Sensitive data leak {{can cause}} {{significant}} loss for some organizations, especially for technology intensive companies and country security departments. Traditional {{mandatory access control}} (MAC) can only control whether the user can access the sensitive data or not, and cannot prevent the user to leak or spread the data. So even designed impeccable access control policies, we still cannot prevent inside leak. A nature solution is using physical isolation to prevent sensitive data from being leaked outside network; however inside the physical isolated network, data still can be spread from one subnet to another. We present Secure Subnet System, a BLP model base security system that can provide more strong access control, which is called mandatory action control. In our system after a <b>user</b> <b>read</b> sensitive data, system will dynamically change security policies to prevent the user to leak these data or spread the data outside to another subnet. We use a state machine model to describe our system, and use secure transfer equations to dynamically calculate the system policies for each new state.

In this paper we also show the design details of the demon and evaluate the demon both from security and performance. The evaluation {{results show that the}} output of the security tests case are under expected; and the performance test case show that, for the 64 KB IO chunk size, IO read loss can be improved to 6. 6 %, IO write loss can be improved to 1. 2 % after optimization...|$|E

40|$|Bibliography: p. 100 - 104. Office {{automation}} {{systems have}} become an essential tool for {{the operation of the}} modern office. With the emphasis of a modern office being placed on efficiency and ease of communication, office automation systems have become the backbone of successful businesses. COSNET is a prototype office automation system designed and implemented at the Department of the University of Cape Town and runs on Personal Computers that are linked to a NCR UNIX TOWER, which acts as the host. This dissertation investigates the different facilities supported by some of the office automation systems compared in this thesis, and describes the COSNET features. This prototype office automation system supports many of the facilities that are supported by large office automation systems. COSNET allows the user to define any MS-DOS based editor or word processor, and uses a simple editor for the creation of mail. The electronic filing facility allows documents to be created, filed, retrieved and deleted, and thus provides the users with the necessary features for document exchange. A user may set access permissions to each of his documents and may grant other users either read or write access to a specific document. The mail facility lets the <b>user</b> <b>read,</b> file, forward, delete and print a message, and supports classification of mail. A calendar facility is used as an electronic diary and stores all the user's schedules. These schedules may be viewed in either daily, weekly and monthly display modes. Read and write access to the calendar can be set by the user, in order to allow other users to manipulate his schedules. Any MS-DOS based application software can be added to COSNET. This facility allows the COSNET user to configure the office automation system to simulate the office environment. COSNET thus supports most of the necessary features required by an office automation system...|$|E
40|$|This {{application}} note discusses how AES- 128 encryption {{can be implemented}} with Zilog’s Z 8 Encore! family of 8 -bit microcontrollers. The AES- 128 standard is an encryp-tion solution that has been developed to satisfy many rapidly-evolving security concerns that have arisen within the computer and embedded chip industries. This standard employs 128 -bit block data transfer and a 128 -bit key to cipher and decipher plain data. The AES algorithm was implemented {{in compliance with the}} NIST FIPS 197 that governs how data is transferred via advanced encryption methods. Implementing the AES- 128 standard with Zilog’s Z 8 Encore! XP MCUs offers high-speed performance when undergoing a encryption/decryption process, resulting in a 1. 8909 ms cipher rate and a 2. 604 ms decipher rate. The source code consumes a maximum of 2. 5 KB of MCU memory. Zilog’s Z 8 Encore! XP MCU also offers high level of protection from unauthorized attempts to read or write to the embedded code within Flash program memory. Users can select option bits for Flash Read Protect, Flash Write Protect, or both. The Flash Read Pro-tect option bit disables external <b>user</b> <b>read</b> access to Flash Program Memory; the Flash Write Protect bit disables external user access to program this Flash program memory. These features allows all encryption and decryption code to be fully secured. There are two source code files associated with this {{application note}}. AN 0338 -SC 01. zip contains a full representation of the AES routines described herein. In AN 0338 -SC 02. zip, some lines of code in the main. c file have been commented out to facilitate testing cipher and decipher times and memory usage when a terminal emulation program is not being used. All source code has been tested with version 5. 0. 0 of ZDS II for Z 8 Encore! XP MCUs; both of these. zip files are available for download from the Zilog website.
