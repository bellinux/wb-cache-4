5|$|During 1997, {{there were}} five {{incidents}} where NSB's Nordic Mobile Telephone equipment interfered with the locomotive's electronics, causing the emergency brakes to activate. This caused a temporary halt until the motorman had unlocked the brakes. The problem was fixed by moving NSB's mobile senders. The units were taken into <b>use</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Bergen Line from 5 January 1997. Later they entered into <b>use</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Dovre and Sørland Lines, and then on regional trains around Oslo, such as the Vestfold Line. In August 1998, NSB stated that El 18 used more power {{than some of the}} substation transformers along the line could handle, particularly along the Vestfold Line. Part of the problem was caused by a mechanism in the locomotives whereby the motor was turned off if the wheels spin. The result was that the full power output of the El 18 along parts of the railway network could not be utilized.|$|E

The traffic through Trondheim–Hell increased; commuter trains terminated at several different stations. From 1930, multiple units were also put into <b>use</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> line.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to distributing {{the letter to}} the media, Albizu wrote his own, charging that Rhoads was part of a US plot to exterminate Puerto Ricans. He linked the letter to other complaints about American imperialism, saying that the US governors in Puerto Rico encouraged labor emigration rather than improving employment, and promoted birth control, which was offensive to the majority Catholic residents. Later that year Governor Beverley struggled with a greater political crisis than the Rhoads letter over his own remarks encouraging birth control <b>use</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island.

5|$|No primary {{airports}} {{had been}} built in Helgeland by the mid-1960s. The coastal parts of the region, such as at Brønnøysund, were without highways and railways.

A committee, led by Erik Himle and later Preben Munthe, was appointed in 1962 to consider additional airports in Norway. The Sud Aviation Caravelle jet aircraft {{was about to be}} phased into <b>use</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> main domestic routes by Scandinavian Airlines System and the committee recommended in 1964 that nine new airports be built which could serve jetliners, including an airport in Sandnesssjøen.|$|E
