2500|$|Speed {{reduction}} {{has traditionally}} been attempted {{by the introduction of}} statutory speed limits. [...] Traffic speeds of 30km/h (20mph) and lower are said to be more desirable on urban roads with mixed traffic. [...] The Austrian city of Graz, which has achieved steady growth in cycling, has applied 30km/h limits to 75% its streets since 1994. [...] Zones where speeds are set at 30 km/h (or 20mph) are gaining popularity [...] as they are found to be effective at reducing crashes and increasing community cohesion. Speed limits which are set below the speed that most motorists perceive to be reasonable for the given road require additional measures to improve compliance. [...] Attempts to improve speed limit observance are usually by either education, enforcement or road engineering. [...] "Education" [...] can mean publicity campaigns or targeted road <b>user</b> <b>training.</b>|$|E

40|$|Price {{steering}} is {{the practice}} of ?changing the order of search results to highlight specific products? and products prices. In this paper, we show an initial investigation to quantify the price steering level in search results shown to different kind of users on Google Shopping. We mimic the category of affluent users. Affluent users visit websites offering expensive services, search for luxury goods and always click on the most costly items results at Google Shopping. The goal is checking if <b>users</b> <b>trained</b> in specific ways get different search results, based {{on the price of}} the products in the results. Evaluation is based on well known metrics to measure page results differences and similarities. Experiments are automised, rendering large-scale investigations feasible. Results of our experiments, based on a preliminary experimental setting, show that <b>users</b> <b>trained</b> on some particular topics are not always influenced by previous search and click activities.

Moodle is a free software learning platform, based on the pedagogical principles of the constructivism and constructionism, according to which the student is the responsible for its own learning, and the tutor changes from being the transmitter of know-how to become the guide of the student in this process.

40|$|There are {{currently}} {{many different types}} of inexpensive input devices available to consumers, each of which excels at performing a specific type of task. For instance, mice provide accurate pointing; keyboards are useful for rapid input of characters, and touch pads offer a compact means for mobile device input. However situations arise wherein these devices are awkward to use and do not fully utilize the abilities of the user. One situation where this occurs is when attempting to recognize 2 -dimensional gestures in 3 -dimensional space. One device that is preferable to many in this area is the Wii remote, which contains accelerometers to track movement in 3 -dimensional space. Current methods for interpreting gestures performed with this device require that the <b>user</b> <b>train</b> the gesture in advance. However, situations may arise wherein training the system is inconvenient or impossible. To address this issue, we have investigated a method of recognizing 2 -dimensional gestures with the Wii remote device without requiring that the <b>user</b> <b>train</b> the gesture in advance...|$|R
