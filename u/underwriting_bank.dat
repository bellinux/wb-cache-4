The returns of ETNs are usually linked {{to the performance of}} a market benchmark or strategy, less investor fees. When an investor buys an ETN, the <b>underwriting</b> <b>bank</b> promises to pay the amount reflected in the index, minus fees upon maturity.

50|$|Lockups are {{designed}} to prevent insiders from liquidating assets too quickly after a company goes public. When employees and pre-IPO investors initially get their shares or options, they sign {{a contract with the}} company that typically prohibits trades for the first 90-180 days after a future IPO. When the company is ready to go public, the <b>underwriting</b> <b>bank</b> then reaffirms the existing agreements in new contracts. This helps to ensure the market will not disproportionately increase the supply, which drives prices downward. While lockups used to be simple—usually lasting 180 days for everyone—they have become increasingly complex.|$|E
40|$|Over-allotment {{arrangements}} are nowadays part {{of almost any}} initial public offering. The <b>underwriting</b> <b>banks</b> borrow stocks from the previous shareholders to issue more than the initially announced number of shares. This is combined with the option to cover this short position at the issue price. We present empirical evidence {{on the value of}} these arrangements to the underwriters of initial public offerings on the Neuer Markt. The over-allotment arrangement is regarded as a portfolio of a long call option and a short position in a forward contract on the stock, which is different from other approaches presented in the literature. Given the economically substantial values for these option- like claims we try to identify benefits to previous shareholders or new investors when the company is using this instrument in the process of going public. Although we carefully control for potential endogeneity problems, we find virtually no evidence for a reduction in underpricing for firms using over-allotment arrangements. Furthermore, we do not find evidence for more pronounced price stabilization activities or better aftermarket performance for firms granting an over-allotment arrangement to the <b>underwriting</b> <b>banks.</b> EFM Classification: 230, 41...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of {{investment}} banks’ political contributions on their underwriting business with local government officials. Using an original data set on municipal <b>underwriting</b> <b>banks</b> political contributions from 1994 to 2013, I find that political contributions are strongly associated with {{the likelihood that a}} contributing bank is hired, the bank’s market share, and the bond issuance cost.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I study how home bias varies {{over time in}} context of {{international}} corporate bond underwriting. I observe that home bias in bank’s country level underwriting portfolio increases by 27 % on average when experiencing a crisis at its home market. The effect is limited to transparent and higher quality issuers, indicating homogeneous treatment of more opaque and lower credit quality issuers during crisis independent of their geographic origin. I also show that banks tend to withdraw to lesser extent from markets where underlying sovereign credit quality {{is higher than the}} one in their home market, suggesting that the shift is somewhat driven by flight to quality considerations. Moreover, I find that banks treat their relationship client firms equally during crisis regardless of their home origin. I also show that increase in home bias is positively correlated with geographical distance between the issuer and the <b>underwriting</b> <b>bank.</b> I find no evidence that the increase would be less severe when the <b>underwriting</b> <b>bank</b> shares common familiarity characteristics with the issuer...|$|E

40|$|In {{the first}} essay {{we examine the}} effect of {{concurrent}} lending and underwriting on IPO withdrawal, we find that IPOs underwritten by the firms’ concurrent lending banks are significantly more likely to be withdrawn. The result is robust to controlling for the common factors that affect IPO withdrawal and also for endogeneity using a propensity score matching portfolio. Our evidence suggests a cost to IPO firms’ hiring concurrent lending banks as underwriters despite the potential benefit of informational scope economies such intermediaries may provide. It is consistent with an alternative argument that a current lending and <b>underwriting</b> <b>bank</b> has less incentive to help sell its client firms’ securities because of its lock-in of the firms’ subsequent borrowing needs even when it fails to sell the securities. In the second essay, we examine the investment decisions of second-time IPO firms after successfully going public. Our findings show that, contrary to first time IPOs, second-time IPOs are not active acquirers and spend significantly more on CAPEX and R 2 ̆ 6 D than first-time IPOs.

40|$|We examine {{underwriting}} {{fees for}} repeat issuers of new securities {{to determine the}} relation between loyalty to an <b>underwriting</b> <b>bank</b> and the fees charged. For a sample of offers over the 1975 - 2001 period, we find that loyalty is associated with lower fees for common stock offers, consistent with valuable relationship capital being built through loyalty. For debt offers, however, we document the opposite pattern, consistent with relationship capital not being as valuable. For both offer types, firms that graduate to higher quality banks face lower fees. Firms that {{are more likely to}} be switching banks to improve analyst coverage face high fees for common stock offers, but not for debt offers. Firms often have a primary investment bank, one with whom they have a long-term relationship and regularly use for underwriting new security issues to the public. The persistence of such bank-client relationships in a competitive market for intermediation services has been ascribed to “relationship specific capital ” by, among others, Rajan (1992) and James (1992).

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how relationship capital drives competition among <b>underwriting</b> <b>banks</b> {{in the corporate}} bond underwriting market. The recent deregulation and subsequent re-entry by commercial banks into this market in the U. S. raises policy interest in measuring competitive effect of the deregulation. The theories of relationship and reputation imply that (1) the entrants' products are differentiated from those of incumbents due to their pre-existing relationships with issuers, and (2) the issuers' valuation of relationship capital in turn depends on their own reputation in the capital markets. I investigate these hypotheses by using the methods developed in the empirical industrial organization literature, which have not been applied to the financial context. In doing so the paper also attempts to fill this {{gap between the two}} literatures. Using individual issuer data, I jointly estimate a discrete choice model of underwriter demand and a model of issue-specific pricing by individual banks. I find that there is a trade-off between relationships and price in the demand equation and that this trade-off is sharply higher for low-reputation issuers such as junk bond issuers and first-time issuers. The lower is the reputation of the issuer, the more the demander is willing to trade off price for the relationship. This nding is consistent with the certification effect of commercial <b>bank</b> <b>underwriting.</b> Commercial <b>bank</b> entry has increased competition in this market because their client-specific relationship capital has increased product differentiation in the market.

Known as the Central de Información de Riesgos (CIR), the dataset contains information on any loan commitment above € 6, 000 granted by any bank operating in Spain since 1984. We find that a variety of line-specific, borrower-specific and lender-specific characteristics as well as general economic conditions influence credit line use. The default status of the credit line is found to be the primary factor driving credit line usage, and this effect increases as the firm approaches default. Another influential factor seems to be an aging effect in which firms reduce their usage as the line ages. We find robust evidence that riskier firms, as suggested by their defaulting on their credit commitments, use their credit lines more intensively than firms that do not default.
