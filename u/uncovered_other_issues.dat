40|$|The {{research}} {{outlined in}} this paper began as a study to explore the meaning attached {{to the creation of}} a new type of destination from a postmodernist perspective. The concept of the "phantasmal destination" was derived from the observation of several destinations favored by tourists primarily because of a myth associated with them, generally with no basis in historical reality. Shangri-La in Yunnan, China, was selected for this investigation due to its unique qualities containing all of the elements of this tourism phenomenon. This qualitative study applied the Grounded Theory Method, and <b>uncovered</b> <b>other</b> <b>issues</b> related to the perception of "other," the effect images created by the media, and commercial considerations on development decisions leading to the distortion of cultures.

50|$|Yourkevitch {{himself was}} in New York City on 9 February 1942 when the Normandie accidentally caught fire {{in one of}} the World War II eras most astounding disasters. He could have saved this ship, based mostly on his {{intimate}} knowledge of the liners ballast systems, but the NYC fire department would not call on him. They shot too much water to the wrong places and she capsized overnight. (The situation was also {{complicated by the fact that}} the ships advanced fire suppression systems had been offline and un-staffed at the time). The United States Navy would later partner with him during what was then the largest and most complicated salvage operation on a passenger liner until the advent of the Costa Concordia incident of 2013. Even after the ship was but a blistered hull with most of her superstructure gone, he strongly believed she was salvageable. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and others in the war department felt the same way, but further inspections of her innovative hull nevertheless <b>uncovered</b> damages and <b>other</b> <b>issues</b> in the ship and made her beyond repair according to experts. The idea of putting the former ocean liner to sea as an aircraft carrier was also shelved. The Normandies eventual scrapping in 1946 was said to have been understandably heartbreaking to Yourkevitch, as well as associated maritime architects such has William Francis Gibbs, who would soon design his own masterpiece, the SS United States in 1951, with fireproofing especially in mind.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of two studies comparing traditional lab-based usability testing and remote Web-based usability testing of Web sites. Two sites were tested: an employee benefits site and a financial information site. The remote tests used an automated technique whereby the users participated from their normal work locations using their normal browser, and there was no real-time observa-tion. Tasks were presented to the user in a small browser window {{at the top of the}} screen that was also used to cap-ture their input. Results showed high correlations between lab and remote tests for the task completion data and the task time data. Subjective ratings of the sites did not corre-late as well. The most critical usability issues with the sites were identified by both techniques, although each tech-nique also uniquely <b>uncovered</b> <b>other</b> <b>issues.</b> In general, the results indicate that both the lab and remote tests capture very similar information about the usability of a site. Each type of test appears to offer its own advantages and disad-vantages in terms of the usability issues it can uncover...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Access {{barriers}} {{to health care}} for minority populations has been a feature of medical, health and social science literature for over a decade. Considerations of cultural barriers have featured in this literature, but definitions {{of what constitutes a}} cultural barrier have varied. In this paper, data from recent interviews with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, Aboriginal Health Workers and other non-Indigenous health professionals in north-west Queensland assist to refine the meaning of this term and <b>uncovered</b> <b>other</b> <b>issues</b> disguised as 'cultural' difference. Design: Semistructured interviews with community and health professionals. Setting: Mount Isa, Queensland, Australia. Participants: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, Aboriginal Health Workers and other health professionals in Mount Isa between 2007 and 2009. Results: Cultural barriers were considered differently by Aboriginal patients and health practitioners. While Aboriginal patients focused heavily on social relationships and issues of respect and trust, most practitioners seemed more focused on making Aboriginal people feel comfortable with changes to physical environments and systems, with less emphasis on creating strong interpersonal relationships. Conclusions: For Aboriginal patients the focus on interpersonal relationships between themselves and health practitioners is paramount. Creating comforting physical environments and systems that are easier to navigate do assist in overcoming cultural barriers, but are often seen as little more than token gestures if trusting interpersonal relationships are not formed between patient and practitioner...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in information technologies and subsequent explosive growth of computer software use in practically {{all aspects of}} everyday life provide tremendous opportunities and benefits for improving people 2 ̆ 7 s lives. However, significant proportion of software projects represents cancelled, abandoned or otherwise failed projects. This situation exists not only in commercial software products or government information systems, but also in an increasingly popular and important domain of free/libre and open source software (FLOSS). The problem of failures in software development projects requires identification {{and understanding of the}} factors of success and their interrelationships. Practice and previous research suggest that governance of software development projects plays crucial role in their success. Increasing adoption and sponsorship of FLOSS by commercial firms and government organizations present additional challenges; such sponsorship may also interact with governance in FLOSS projects and play a role in determining their success. This dissertation focused on analyzing the role and significance of governance and organizational sponsorship in the success of FLOSS development. This study used both conceptual analysis and empirical methods. The conceptual analysis phase, a preliminary study based on the review of existing literature, produced a partial model of success in FLOSS development. This model was verified in an empirical phase, which statistically analyzed data from multiple FLOSS repositories and other public sources. The statistical analysis was based on structural equation modeling (SEM) approach. Results of this study did not confirm hypothesized effects of the main two factors (governance and organizational sponsorship) on FLOSS success, but confirmed a positive effect of project maturity on the success. The likely reason of the lack of support for the main factors is unavailability of sufficient and correct data for proper operationalization. This and <b>other</b> <b>uncovered</b> <b>issues</b> are planned to be addressed in the future research on the topic, for which this dissertation formed a solid conceptual and data analysis framework...|$|R

Further, a desire to wear certain clothing styles (e.g., low cut tops) was also key to their decision to augment their breasts.|$|R
