5|$|By Sunday afternoon, 18hours {{after the}} alarm {{was raised in}} Pudding Lane, the fire had become a raging {{firestorm}} that created its own weather. A tremendous <b>uprush</b> of hot air above the flames was driven by the chimney effect wherever constrictions narrowed the air current, such as the constricted space between jettied buildings, and this left a vacuum at ground level. The resulting strong inward winds did not tend to put the fire out, as might be thought; instead, they supplied fresh oxygen to the flames, and the turbulence created by the <b>uprush</b> made the wind veer erratically both {{north and south of}} the main easterly direction of the gale which was still blowing.|$|E

5000|$|However {{this does}} not include a (non-free) fall in which air {{resistance}} produces drag forces that reduce the acceleration, until constant terminal velocity is reached. At terminal velocity the accelerometer will indicate 1 g acceleration upwards.

60|$|Now what I {{want to do}} here is to theorize {{about this}} shadow, this chill and arrest, that seems to have come upon the flourishing and {{expanding}} civilization in which all of us were born and reared. I want to put a particular view of what is happening before you, and what it is that we are up against. I want to put before you for your judgment the view that this overstrain and breaking down and stoppage of the great <b>uprush</b> of civilization that has gone on for the past three centuries is due to the same forces and is the logical outcome of the same forces that led to that <b>uprush,</b> to that tremendous expansion of human knowledge and power and life. And that that breaking up is an inevitable thing unless we meet it by a very great effort of a particular kind.|$|E

60|$|He {{remained}} motionless--his {{every sense}} intent upon the flickering patch of darkness. He {{became aware of}} some faint, remote, dark specks floating lightly through the outer air. They came down towards him, fitfully, eddyingly, and passed aside out of the <b>uprush</b> from the fan. A gleam of light flickered, the specks flashed white, and then the darkness came again.

6000|$|We drank tea {{the night}} before I left Grasmere, on the island in that lovely lake; our kettle swung over the fire, hanging from the branch of a fir-tree, and I lay and saw the woods, and mountains, and lake all trembling, and as it were {{idealized}} through the suble smoke, which rose up from the clear, red embers of the fir-apples which we had collected: afterwards we made a glorious bonfire on the margin, by some elder bushes, whose twigs heaved and sobbed in the <b>uprushing</b> column of smoke, {{and the image of}} the bonfire, and of us that danced round it, ruddy, laughing faces in the twilight; the image of this in a lake, smooth as that sea, to whose waves the Son of God had said, [...] "Peace!"

40|$|A {{tidal bore}} {{is a series}} of waves {{propagating}} upstream in the river mouth as the tidal flow turns to rising in macro-tidal conditions. Some related geophysical processes include the tsunami-induced bores and <b>uprushing</b> bores on beaches. In the present study, the inception of sediment motion beneath tidal bores was investigated physically. No sediment motion was observed in the initially steady flow and beneath undular bores. A transient sheet flow motion was observed beneath breaking bores and the onset of sediment motion was closely linked {{with the passage of the}} roller toe. The forces acting on the movable gravel bed particles were estimated from the physical measurements. The results showed that the longitudinal pressure gradient force was the dominant contribution de-stabilising the particles and inducing the onset of sediment motion. The drag force added a sizeable contribution to maintain the upstream particle motion, although the entire sheet flow motion was brief. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

6000|$|They shouted {{together}} {{with such a}} common intensity of direction that I halted and looked seaward. I saw the tall fountain flung by a shot that had just missed the great warship. A second rose still nearer us, a third, and a fourth, and then a great <b>uprush</b> of dust, a whirling cloud, leapt out of the headland whence the rocket had come, and spread with a slow deliberation right and left. Hard on that an enormous crash, and {{the man with the}} full voice leapt and cried, [...] "Hit!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'At last I {{sat down}} on the summit of the hillock, and watched this strange {{incredible}} company of blind things groping to and fro, and making uncanny noises to each other, as the glare of the fire beat on them. The coiling <b>uprush</b> of smoke streamed across the sky, and through the rare tatters of that red canopy, remote as though they belonged to another universe, shone the little stars. Two or three Morlocks came blundering into me, and I drove them off with blows of my fists, trembling as I did so.|$|E
40|$|The {{collection}} of detailed field measurements from the swash zone during storms {{is an extremely}} challenging task which is difficult to execute with traditional in-situ deployments (e. g., scaffold rigs with instruments). The levels of difficulty increase for gravel beaches where the wave energy reaches the beach face with almost no loss of energy,leading to violent plunging wave breaking on the beach face that can produce large vertical morphological changes and extremely strong <b>uprushes</b> that can easily and rapidly damage, bury or detach instrumentation. Remote-sensing techniques emerge as the most appropriate solution to perform field measurements under such adverse conditions since {{they have the ability}} to perform measurements without being deployed in-situ. A mid-range (~ 50 m) Laser-scanner mounted on a tower (~ 7 m high) in the mid beach face of a gravel beach (Loe Bar - SW England) was used to measure bed-level changes and runup at a sampling rate of 2 Hz along one beach profile during a storm. The results from the comparison of this system with other state-of-the-art instruments (e. g., ultrasonic bed level sensors, GPS and video cameras) indicate that the quality of the measurements obtained is within the accuracy of the standard methods. The advantages of this system is the reduced logistical infrastructure required for the deployment, the capability to perform surveys with high spatial and vertical resolution, during day and night, and to reach areas of the swash zone where no other instrument can be deployed safely. Measurements performed with a laser-scanner on a gravel beach (Loe Bar) show complex and fast-changing morphology on the gravel beach, which appears to be a form of negative morphodynamic feedback to controls the hydrodynamic evolution in the swash zone...|$|R
6000|$|Then, suddenly, like {{an escape}} {{of water from}} under a lock-gate, a great <b>uprush</b> of horrible {{realisation}} set all his thoughts swirling, and simultaneously I perceived that the vein was cut. He started back with a hoarse exclamation, and I saw the brown-purple blood gather in a swift bead, and run trickling. He was horrified. He pitched the red-stained scalpel on to the octagonal table; and instantly both doctors flung themselves upon me, making hasty and ill-conceived efforts to remedy the disaster. [...] "Ice!" [...] said Mowbray, gasping. But I knew that I was killed, though my body still clung to me.|$|E
6000|$|So {{that all}} this {{religious}} stir, which seems so multifold and incidental and disconnected and confused and entirely ineffective to-day, may be and most probably will be, in quite a few years a great flood of religious unanimity pouring over and changing all human affairs, sweeping away the old priesthoods and tabernacles and symbols and shrines, the last crumb of the Orphic victim and the last rag of the Serapeum, and turning all men about into one direction, as the ships and houseboats swing round together in some great river with the <b>uprush</b> of the tide.

60|$|She {{seemed to}} be in a strange world, a soundless, ruinous world, a world of heaped broken things. And it was lit--and somehow this was more {{familiar}} to her mind than any other fact about her--by a flickering, purplish-crimson light. Then close to her, rising above a confusion of debris, she recognised the Trocadero; it was changed, something had gone from it, but its outline was unmistakable. It stood out against a streaming, whirling <b>uprush</b> of red-lit steam. And with that she recalled Paris and the Seine and the warm, overcast evening and the beautiful, luminous organisation of the War Control....|$|E
6000|$|... "The <b>uprush</b> of his {{released}} optimism {{burst into}} stars {{like a rocket}} when he suddenly fell in love. He happened to be shooting a high and very headlong weir in a canoe, by way of proving to himself that he was alive; and he soon found himself involved in some doubt about the continuance of the fact. What was worse, he found he had equally jeopardized a harmless lady alone in a rowing-boat, and one who had provoked death by no professions of philosophic negation. He apologized in wild gasps through all his wild wet labours to bring her to the shore, {{and when he had}} done so at last, he seems to have proposed to her on the bank. Anyhow, with the same impetuosity with which he had nearly murdered her, he completely married her; and she was the lady in green to whom I had recently said `good-night.' ...|$|E
60|$|But if {{the attack}} was superb, the defence was magnificent; nor could the devoted heroism of the Irish {{soldiers}} surpass the stout endurance of the Dutch. The Artillery redoubled their efforts. The whole summit of the hill was alive with shell. Shrapnel flashed into being above the crests, and the ground sprang up into dust whipped by the showers of bullets and splinters. Again and again whole sections of the entrenchments vanished in an awful <b>uprush</b> of black earth and smoke, smothering the fierce blaze of the lyddite shells from the howitzers and heavy artillery. The cannonade grew to tremendous thundering hum. Not less than sixty guns were firing continuously on the Boer trenches. But the musketry was never subdued for an instant. Amid the smoke and the dust the slouch hats could still be seen. The Dutch, firm and undaunted, stood to their parapets and plied their rifles with deadly effect.|$|E
60|$|He {{thought of}} this old fancy of his, and it seemed {{impossible}} {{that he should be}} in love with Mildred Rogers. Her name was grotesque. He did not think her pretty; he hated the thinness of her, only that evening he had noticed how the bones of her chest stood out in evening-dress; he went over her features one by one; he did not like her mouth, and the unhealthiness of her colour vaguely repelled him. She was common. Her phrases, so bald and few, constantly repeated, showed the emptiness of her mind; he recalled her vulgar little laugh at the jokes of the musical comedy; and he remembered the little finger carefully extended when she held her glass to her mouth; her manners like her conversation, were odiously genteel. He remembered her insolence; sometimes he had felt inclined to box her ears; and suddenly, he knew not why, perhaps it was the thought of hitting her or the recollection of her tiny, beautiful ears, he was seized by an <b>uprush</b> of emotion. He yearned for her. He thought of taking her in his arms, the thin, fragile body, and kissing her pale mouth: he wanted to pass his fingers down the slightly greenish cheeks. He wanted her.|$|E
60|$|It was heavy, this vapour, {{heavier than}} the densest smoke, so that, after the first tumultuous <b>uprush</b> and outflow of its impact, it sank down {{through the air and}} poured over the ground in a manner rather liquid than gaseous, abandoning the hills, and {{streaming}} into the valleys and ditches and watercourses even as I have heard the carbonic-acid gas that pours from volcanic clefts is wont to do. And where it came upon water some chemical action occurred, and the surface would be instantly covered with a powdery scum that sank slowly and made way for more. The scum was absolutely insoluble, and it is a strange thing, seeing the instant effect of the gas, that one could drink without hurt the water from which it had been strained. The vapour did not diffuse as a true gas would do. It hung together in banks, flowing sluggishly down the slope of the land and driving reluctantly before the wind, and very slowly it combined with the mist and moisture of the air, and sank to the earth in the form of dust. Save that an unknown element giving a group of four lines in the blue of the spectrum is concerned, we are still entirely ignorant of the nature of this substance.|$|E
60|$|He did {{not quite}} know what he ought to say next. Here at last was his chance of an adventure, {{and he would be}} a fool not to take it; but it was a little ordinary, and he had {{expected}} more glamour. He had read many descriptions of love, and he felt in himself none of that <b>uprush</b> of emotion which novelists described; he was not carried off his feet in wave upon wave of passion; nor was Miss Wilkinson the ideal: he had often pictured to himself the great violet eyes and the alabaster skin of some lovely girl, and he had thought of himself burying his face in the rippling masses of her auburn hair. He could not imagine himself burying his face in Miss Wilkinson's hair, it always struck him as a little sticky. All the same it would be very satisfactory to have an intrigue, and he thrilled with the legitimate pride he would enjoy in his conquest. He owed it to himself to seduce her. He made up his mind to kiss Miss Wilkinson; not then, but in the evening; it would be easier in the dark, and after he had kissed her the rest would follow. He would kiss her that very evening. He swore an oath to that effect.|$|E
60|$|So, hard {{upon the}} <b>uprush</b> {{of the first}} German air-fleet, these Asiatic swarms took to the atmosphere. Instantly every {{organised}} Government {{in the world was}} frantically and vehemently building airships and whatever approach to a flying machine its inventors' had discovered. There was no time for diplomacy. Warnings and ultimatums were telegraphed to and fro, and in a few hours all the panic-fierce world was openly at war, and at war in the most complicated way. For Britain and France and Italy had declared war upon Germany and outraged Swiss neutrality; India, at the sight of Asiatic airships, had broken into a Hindoo insurrection in Bengal and a Mohametan revolt hostile to this in the North-west Provinces--the latter spreading like wildfire from Gobi to the Gold Coast--and the Confederation of Eastern Asia had seized the oil wells of Burmha and was impartially attacking America and Germany. In a week they were building airships in Damascus and Cairo and Johannesburg; Australia and New Zealand were frantically equipping themselves. One unique and terrifying aspect of this development was the swiftness with which these monsters could be produced. To build an ironclad took from two to four years; an airship could be put together in as many weeks. Moreover, compared with even a torpedo boat, the airship was remarkably simple to construct, given the air-chamber material, the engines, the gas plant, and the design, it was really not more complicated and far easier than an ordinary wooden boat had been a hundred years before. And now from Cape Horn to Nova Zembla, and from Canton round to Canton again, there were factories and workshops and industrial resources.|$|E
60|$|And all {{the time}} I was {{thinking}} what a shame {{it was that he}} was not sticking his spade into his own garden, instead of mine: he knew about the earth and the underworld of seeds, the resurrection of Spring and the flowers that appear in order like a procession marshalled by a herald. He possessed the garden intellectually and spiritually, while I only possessed it politically. I know more about flowers than coal-owners know about coal; for at least I pay them honour when they are brought above the surface of the earth. I know more about gardens than railway shareholders seem to know about railways: for at least I know that it needs a man to make a garden; a man whose name is Adam. But as I walked on that grass my ignorance overwhelmed me&mdash;and yet that phrase is false, because it suggests something like a storm from the sky above. It is truer to say that my ignorance exploded underneath me, like a mine dug long before; and indeed it was dug before the beginning of the ages. Green bombs of bulbs and seeds were bursting underneath me everywhere; and, so far as my knowledge went, they had been laid by a conspirator. I trod quite uneasily on this <b>uprush</b> of the earth; the Spring is always only a fruitful earthquake. With the land all alive under me I began to wonder more and more why this man, who had made the garden, did not own the garden. If I stuck a spade into the ground, I should be astonished at what I found there...and just as I thought this I saw that the gardener was astonished too.|$|E
60|$|For {{the same}} <b>uprush</b> of fancy which {{had shown him}} with all the force of {{mathematical}} demonstration that life had no meaning, brought with it another idea; {{and that was why}} Cronshaw, he imagined, had given him the Persian rug. As the weaver elaborated his pattern for no end but the pleasure of his aesthetic sense, so might a man live his life, or if one was forced to believe that his actions were outside his choosing, so might a man look at his life, that it made a pattern. There was as little need to do this as there was use. It was merely something he did for his own pleasure. Out of the manifold events of his life, his deeds, his feelings, his thoughts, he might make a design, regular, elaborate, complicated, or beautiful; and though it might be no more than an illusion that he had the power of selection, though it might be no more than a fantastic legerdemain in which appearances were interwoven with moonbeams, that did not matter: it seemed, and so to him it was. In the vast warp of life (a river arising from no spring and flowing endlessly to no sea), with the background to his fancies that there was no meaning and that nothing was important, a man might get a personal satisfaction in selecting the various strands that worked out the pattern. There was one pattern, the most obvious, perfect, and beautiful, in which a man was born, grew to manhood, married, produced children, toiled for his bread, and died; but there were others, intricate and wonderful, in which happiness did not enter and in which success was not attempted; and in them might be discovered a more troubling grace. Some lives, and Hayward's was among them, the blind indifference of chance cut off while the design was still imperfect; and then the solace was comfortable that it did not matter; other lives, such as Cronshaw's, offered a pattern which was difficult to follow, the point of view had to be shifted and old standards had to be altered before one could understand that such a life was its own justification. Philip thought that in throwing over the desire for happiness he was casting aside the last of his illusions. His life had seemed horrible when it was measured by its happiness, but now he seemed to gather strength as he realised that it might be measured by something else. Happiness mattered as little as pain. They came in, both of them, as all the other details of his life came in, to the elaboration of the design. He seemed for an instant to stand above the accidents of his existence, and he felt that they could not affect him again as they had done before. Whatever happened to him now would be one more motive to add to the complexity of the pattern, and when the end approached he would rejoice in its completion. It would be a work of art, and it would be none the less beautiful because he alone knew of its existence, and with his death it would at once cease to be.|$|E
50|$|Swash {{consists}} of two phases: <b>uprush</b> (onshore flow) and backwash (offshore flow). Generally <b>uprush</b> velocities are greater but of shorter duration compared to the backwash. Onshore velocities are at greatest {{at the start of}} the <b>uprush</b> and then decrease, whereas offshore velocities increase towards the end of the backwash. The direction of the <b>uprush</b> varies with the prevailing wind, whereas the backwash is always perpendicular to the coastline. This asymmetrical motion of swash can cause longshore drift as well as cross-shore sediment transport.|$|E
50|$|There are {{fundamental}} differences in sediment transport between the <b>uprush</b> and backwash of the swash flow. The <b>uprush,</b> which is mainly dominated by bore turbulence, especially on steep beaches, generally suspend sediments to transport. Flow velocities, suspended sediment concentrations and suspended fluxes are at greatest {{at the start}} of the <b>uprush</b> when the turbulence is maximum. Then the turbulence dissipates towards the end of the onshore flow, settling the suspended sediment to the bed. In contrast, the backwash is dominated by the sheet flow and bedload sediment transport. The flow velocity increases towards the end of the backwash causing more bed-generated turbulence, which results in sediment transport near the bed. The direction of the net sediment transport (onshore or offshore) is largely governed by the beachface gradient.|$|E

50|$|By Sunday afternoon, 18 {{hours after}} the alarm was raised in Pudding Lane, the fire had become a raging {{firestorm}} that created its own weather. A tremendous <b>uprush</b> of hot air above the flames was driven by the chimney effect wherever constrictions narrowed the air current, such as the constricted space between jettied buildings, and this left a vacuum at ground level. The resulting strong inward winds did not tend to put the fire out, as might be thought; instead, they supplied fresh oxygen to the flames, and the turbulence created by the <b>uprush</b> made the wind veer erratically both {{north and south of}} the main easterly direction of the gale which was still blowing.|$|E
50|$|The beachface is the planar, {{relatively}} steep {{section of}} the beach profile that is subject to swash processes (Figure 2). The beachface extends from the berm to the low tide level. The beachface is in dynamic equilibrium with swash action when the amount of sediment transport by <b>uprush</b> and backwash are equal. If the beachface is flatter than the equilibrium gradient, more sediment is transported by the <b>uprush</b> to result in net onshore sediment transport. If the beachface is steeper than the equilibrium gradient, the sediment transport {{is dominated by the}} backwash and this results in net offshore sediment transport. The equilibrium beachface gradient is governed by a complex interrelationship of factors such as the sediment size, permeability, and fall velocity in the swash zone as well as the wave height and the wave period. The beachface cannot be considered in isolation from the surf zone to understand the morphological changes and equilibriums as they are strongly affected by the surf zone and shoaling wave processes as well as the swash zone processes.|$|E
5000|$|As {{ocean surface}} waves {{come closer to}} shore they break, forming the foamy, bubbly surface called [...] The region of {{breaking}} waves defines the surf zone. After breaking in the surf zone, the waves (now reduced in height) continue to move in, and they run up onto the sloping front of the beach, forming an <b>uprush</b> of water called swash. The water then runs back again as backswash. The nearshore zone where wave water comes onto the beach is the surf zone. The water in the surf zone, or breaker zone, is shallow, usually between 5 and 10 m (16 and 33 ft) deep; this causes the waves to be unstable.|$|E
50|$|During World War II, on 26 November 1942, one engine, number 2365, {{was working}} an {{afternoon}} New Romney to Ashford passenger train through the Romney Marshes near Lydd {{when she was}} attacked by a low-flying German fighter aircraft. Cannon fire from the plane caused the dome {{on the top of}} the engine's boiler to burst, but no railway staff or passengers were hurt. Either by actual contact as he misjudged his dive, or in the sudden <b>uprush</b> of steam from the boiler, the pilot lost control of his plane and, as it crashed, he was flung out and drowned in a dyke. The engine was reboilered and returned to service on the New Romney branch early the following year.|$|E
50|$|The berm is the {{relatively}} planar {{part of the}} swash zone where the accumulation of sediment occurs at the landward farthest of swash motion (Figure 2). The berm protects the backbeach and coastal dunes from waves but erosion can occur under high energy conditions such as storms. The berm is more easily defined on gravel beaches and there can be multiple berms at different elevations. On sandy beaches in contrast, the gradient of backbeach, berm and beachface can be similar. The height of the berm is governed by the maximum elevation of sediment transport during the <b>uprush.</b> The berm height can be predicted using the equation by Takeda and Sunamura (1982)where Hb is the breaker height, g is gravity and T is the wave period.|$|E
50|$|A torpedo {{fitted with}} a {{proximity}} fuze can be detonated directly under the keel of a target ship. The explosion creates a gas bubble which may damage the keel or underside plating of the target. However, the most destructive part of the explosion is the upthrust of the gas bubble, which will bodily lift the hull in the water. The structure of the hull is designed to resist downward rather than upward pressure, causing severe strain in {{this phase of the}} explosion. When the gas bubble collapses, the hull will tend to fall into the void in the water, creating a sagging effect. Finally, the weakened hull will be hit by the <b>uprush</b> of water caused by the collapsing gas bubble, causing structural failure. On vessels up {{to the size of a}} modern frigate, this can result in the ship breaking in two and sinking. This effect is likely to prove less catastrophic on a much larger hull, for instance that of an aircraft carrier.|$|E
