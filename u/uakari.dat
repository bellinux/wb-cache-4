25|$|Pygmy {{marmosets}} (Cebuella pygmaea), Goeldi marmosets (Callimico goeldii), pacaranas (Dinomys branickii), {{and eastern}} lowland olingos (Bassaricyon alleni) are found here, {{but not in}} regions to the east. Other primates present include tamarins (Saguinus fuscicollis and Saguinus imperator), brown pale-fronted capuchins (Cebus albifrons), squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus), white-faced sakis (Pithecia irrorata), and black spider monkeys (Ateles paniscus). The rare red <b>uakari</b> monkeys (Cacajao calvus) {{are found in the}} north in swamp forests. Nocturnal two-toed sloths (Choloepus hoffmanni) are well distributed throughout this region along with the widespread three-toes sloths (Bradypus variegatus). The Amazon River is a barrier to a number of animals such as the tamarins Saguinus nigricollis, which occur on the north side, and Saguinus mystax, which occurs on the southwest side of the Amazon-Ucayali system.|$|E
50|$|Due to the <b>uakari's</b> location, it is {{extremely}} common for these animals to contract malaria. Primates who have contracted the disease are noticeably paler and are not chosen as sexual partners as {{they do not have}} the desired natural immunity to malaria.|$|R
50|$|They {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} primates, with a stocky build {{due to their}} close skin. The skin is covered in shaggy fur, its coloring varies depending upon species from black to grey and brown up to white. Parts of the face can be bald. The tail, which is not used for grasping but for balance, is also hairy, although the <b>uakari's</b> tail is only a stub.|$|R
50|$|The species Cacajao melanocephalus was {{previously}} named the black-headed <b>uakari</b> and two subspecies {{were thought to}} exist: Cacajao melanocephalus melanocephalus (black-backed <b>uakari)</b> and Cacajao melanocephalus ouakary (golden-backed <b>uakari).</b> However, in 2008 a new black <b>uakari</b> was discovered and the species group was reassessed by Boubli et al. using morphological and molecular analyses. Cacajao melanocephalus ouakary {{was found to be}} a junior synonym of Cacajao melanocephalus but its common name, golden-backed <b>uakari,</b> replaced the previous one, black-headed <b>uakari.</b> Cacajao melanocephalus melanocephalus was elevated to species status as Cacajao hosom (the Neblina <b>uakari),</b> and the new species was named Cacajao ayresi (Aracá <b>uakari).</b>|$|E
50|$|The Neblina <b>uakari</b> (Cacajao hosomi) or black-headed <b>uakari,</b> is a newly {{described}} {{species of}} monkey {{from the far}} northwest Brazilian Amazon and adjacent southern Venezuela.

50|$|The {{arboreal}} bald <b>uakari</b> {{prefers to}} reside in seasonally flooded forests {{in the area of}} the Amazon River Basin, in the countries of Peru and Brazil. It is important that the <b>uakari</b> is arboreal (lives in the tree tops) because of the flooding of the forests and the water rising to great heights during the rainy season. During the dry season, it returns to the ground to look for seeds and other food material. A study of the diet of the <b>uakari</b> found it to consist of 67% seeds, 18% fruit, 6% flowers, 5% animal prey, and buds. Its powerful lower jaw forms a pseudodental comb, which allows the <b>uakari</b> to open the hard surfaces of unripe fruits and eat the nuts that most other primates would not be able to open. It will also eat insects that happen to cross its path, however it does not specifically pursue this type of food.|$|E

50|$|<b>Uakari</b> is {{the common}} name for the New World monkeys of the genus Cacajao. Both the English and {{scientific}} names {{are believed to have}} originated from indigenous languages.|$|E
50|$|The bald <b>uakari</b> weighs between 2.75 and 3.45 kg (6.1 and 7.6 lb), {{with head}} and body lengths average 45.6 cm (18.0 in) (male) and 44.0 cm (17.3 in) (female). In general, the bald <b>uakari</b> has a long, shaggy coat ranging from white in color to red and its head is bald. The tail is bob-like and rather short for a New World monkey (about 5.9 in), at {{only half the}} length of the body and head combined. Its scarlet red face is {{due to the lack of}} skin {{pigments}} and plentiful capillaries that run under its facial tissue.|$|E

50|$|The {{bright red}} facial skin {{is a sign}} of good health and allows for the {{determination}} of a healthy mate. The breeding season is between October and May. Its gestation period is approximately six months. Both sexes have a sternal gland, which might be involved in olfactory communication, especially during mating, when the female encourages the male to mate by releasing an attractive scent. The bald <b>uakari</b> lives approximately 30 years and has been known to live over 30 years in captivity.|$|E
5000|$|They {{typically}} live {{in groups}} of 5-40 individuals, but occasionally more than 100 may come together. Individuals within a subgroup exist in close proximity and interact frequently. The <b>uakari</b> are diurnal. [...] They move around by walking and running on all fours and even climbing and galloping. Leaping is the main method of travel, allowing them to cover a distance of 10 meters in one leap. Swimming is done only when required, as when they accidentally fall into the water.|$|E
