500|$|On October 14, 2014, Savage criticized veteran sufferers of post {{traumatic}} stress disorder, {{accusing them of}} [...] "weakness". According to Savage, [...] "Everyone has depression in their life. But if the whole nation is told, 'boo-hoo-hoo, come and get a medication, come and get treatment, talk about mental illness.' You know what you wind <b>up</b> <b>with?</b> <b>You</b> wind up with Obama in the White House and liars in every phase of the government. That's what you wind up with. It's a weak, sick, nation. A weak, sick, broken nation. And you need men like me to save the country. You need men {{to stand up and}} say stop crying like a baby over everything... No wonder we're being laughed at around the world. No wonder ISIS can defeat our military." ...|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thompson of NPR Music was {{disappointed}} with the music video because it [...] "undercuts its message to an alarming degree: The words say 'Since you've been gone / I can breathe for the first time,' but the pictures say, 'Breaking <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> necessitates destroying all of your property.'" [...] At the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards, the music video received nominations for three awards; it won Best Female Video and Best Pop Video, and received a nomination for the Viewer's Choice Awards but lost to Green Day's [...] "Boulevard of Broken Dreams". MusicOMH ranked the music video as the 86th best video of the last decade. In February 2012, the music video received a Pop-Up Video treatment by VH1 which shows [...] "pops up" [...] bubbles containing trivia, witticisms and borderline sexual innuendos throughout the video.|$|E
500|$|Filming for Crossroads {{initiated}} in March 2001 in Baton Rouge and Hammond, Louisiana, near Spears' hometown. Due {{to the fact}} that Spears was also recording her third studio album along with the film's production, filming only wrapped up after six months. Additional scenes were filmed in Los Angeles, California. Crossroads had a total budget of $10 million; a relatively low budget by industry standards. According to the Louisiana Film and Video Commission, the film was originally titled What Friends are For. Spears described it as a teen movie that deals with real issues that normal teenagers live on a daily basis. She continued to explain the film's content, saying that it [...] "is about this journey that the three of us best friends take, finding ourselves and what we want out of life and getting our friendship back. Friends are all you have {{at the end of the}} day. When your boyfriend breaks <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> who do you call? Your girlfriend. I just love that message." ...|$|E

2500|$|On Thank You Daniel, a WWE Network {{tribute to}} Bryan, he {{confirmed}} {{that he has}} been asked about working for WWE in a different capacity, but Bryan compared this to [...] "a partner breaking <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> getting married to someone else and then asking you to be best friends", expanding to say that he needs time to heal emotionally before he can agree to such an offer. During this period WWE confirmed that Bryan would continue to appear for the company in a non in-ring role alongside his wife Brie Bella, who now serves as a WWE Ambassador following her retirement from in-ring competition at WrestleMania 32.|$|E

That cracker bleeding out in the basement, he told me what's what and he got no reason to lie. My brain ready to pop. It's too whack, nobody'd make this up. Nobody would never say that you..." [...] However, Torque blacks out, and when he awakens, Miles is dead. Blackmore then contacts Torque, telling him to come to the drowning pool beneath the prison's factory. As Torque heads there, he is attacked by Foundation soldiers backed up by a helicopter piloted by Jordan, who was lying about her men betraying her. Torque defeats the soldiers and kills Jordan.|$|E
2500|$|Clark {{believes}} that he was punished not for his undisclosed arrest record, but for causing conflict with producers behind the scenes. According to Clark, after {{he made it to}} the twelve finalists' round, he and the other finalists were unduly pressured by producers to sign a contract, using one of two attorneys handpicked by the producers for representation, or be disqualified from the show. Clark and his fellow contestants' position was that having the producers select an attorney for them was a conflict of interest, a conclusion they reached with the advice of Abdul, who had told Clark, [...] "Look, if you can get six of your fellow contestants to stand <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> and say, 'We want our own attorney, we're not rolling with this stuff you want us to do,' they will not kick off the rest of the cast." [...] The other contestants decided to support him in standing up to producers, and consulted with Paula Abdul's lawyer, Howard Siegel, on Abdul's recommendation (though Clark maintains in his book {{that they did not know}} at the time that Siegel was one of Abdul's attorneys). Two weeks later, producers began asking Clark about his arrest record, and dismissed him from the show.|$|E
2500|$|This creates further problems, {{as it is}} {{even more}} crucial to 'save face' after one's {{relationship}} has been broken when one is connected to new media technologies. Erving Goffman argues that all social life boils down to face-to-face interactions. These interpersonal interactions are mediated by what Goffman terms as [...] "face-work", which are the actions undertaken to maintain consistency with one's face, and to uphold the expressive order of social situations. Individuals attempt to keep a positive image of the self when interacting with others, and in order to do so, they may have to alter their appearance or manner in some way. Such face-work can also be seen in new technologies, especially social media websites such as Facebook. If someone breaks <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> you can actively choose what [...] "face" [...] you want to present to your friends, including your ex. You can choose to either post sad updates, which is the most natural thing you would want to do, or you can [...] "save face" [...] by posting happy updates and pictures of you going out with your friends. Even though you may be absolutely heartbroken within, Facebook allows you to hide your true feelings from the online world, and from your ex, by manipulating your profile. New media is being utilized as a tool for helping users present a desirable image of themselves, enabling them to save face in difficult situations. Nearly 35% of respondents in a study admitted to using their Facebook status to make someone think that they had plans, even if they did not.|$|E
