5|$|<b>Underground</b> <b>mine</b> shafts, some {{reaching}} depths over , {{were created}} for the extraction of metal ores. Borehole drilling and derricks were used to lift brine to iron pans where it was distilled into salt. The distillation furnaces were heated by natural gas funneled to the surface through bamboo pipelines. Dangerous amounts of additional gas were siphoned off via carburetor chambers and exhaust pipes.|$|E

Olympic Dam (Roxby Downs) is a large <b>underground</b> <b>mine,</b> Beverley, Four Mile and Honeymoon are in-situ leach mines and Ranger in an open pit mine in the Northern Territory. Uranium mined in Australia is mainly for export. Australia has no nuclear weapons or nuclear-powered vessels.|$|E
5|$|After this transfer, {{the roadway}} carried the CR492 designation. In 1964, several {{abandoned}} <b>underground</b> <b>mine</b> shafts collapsed underneath M-35 in Negaunee, and M-35 was rerouted {{out of the}} city along its current roadway through Negaunee Township, connecting with CR492. The eastern end of CR492 was moved by 2001. Before this realignment, CR492 followed Brookton Road, parallel to US41/M-28 before turning to the previous terminus just west of the border between Marquette Township and the City of Marquette. After the change, CR492 turned north to intersect the highway opposite of Wright Street. The CR492 designation was extended along Wright Street at the same time. In 2006, the city of Marquette extended Wright Street to end at Lakeshore Boulevard.|$|E

40|$|Key words: {{combined}} {{surface and}} underground mining; counter-tilt slope; failure mode; slope stability; limit equilibrium method Abstract. How {{to demonstrate the}} deformation and failure mode of the slope under combine surface and <b>underground</b> <b>mining</b> and evaluate its stability scientifically {{is one of the}} problems that need urgent solutions in mining engineering. First, the deformation and failure mode of the slope under simple surface mining, the deformation and failure mechanism of the overlying strata affected by <b>underground</b> <b>mining</b> and deformation mechanism of the slope under combined surface and <b>underground</b> <b>mining</b> were analyzed, then the failure mode and the stability calculation method of the slope under combined surface and <b>underground</b> <b>mining</b> was studied. The results show that the failure modes of the slope under combined surface and <b>underground</b> <b>mining</b> involve three patterns: slipping failure, subsiding failure and slipping-subsiding combined failure, that the failure modes and the stability of the slope under combined surface and <b>underground</b> <b>mining</b> be significantly affected by the <b>underground</b> <b>mining</b> positions and the influence be mainly controlled by the length of the latent slide plane of the slope and the weakening degree of the rock masses in the subsidence range. Finally, a limit equilibrium method to calculate the slope stability under combined surface and <b>underground</b> <b>mining</b> was put forward...|$|R
50|$|<b>Underground</b> {{soft rock}} <b>mining</b> {{is a group}} of <b>underground</b> <b>mining</b> {{techniques}} used to extract coal, oil shale, potash and other minerals or geological materials from sedimentary ("soft") rocks. Because deposits in sedimentary rocks are commonly layered and relatively less hard, the mining methods used differ from those used to mine deposits in igneous or metamorphic rocks (see <b>Underground</b> <b>mining</b> (hard rock)). <b>Underground</b> <b>mining</b> techniques also differ greatly from those of surface mining.|$|R
5|$|On {{the western}} side of the lower reaches of the Kettle Creek watershed, there is an <b>underground</b> <b>mine</b> complex with 26 sources of acid mine {{drainage}}. The acid mine drainage enters Kettle Creek, among other streams in the area and the sources of it have an average discharge of 479 gallons per minute. They also have 304 milligrams per liter of acidity, 44 milligrams per liter of iron, 21 milligrams per liter of aluminum, 8 milligrams per liter of manganese, and 930 milligrams per liter of sulfates. The alkalinity load from the Alvin R. Bush Dam is about 15 times greater than the acidity load from these acid mine discharges.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that Leggetts Creek sometimes exceeds its total maximum daily load, especially during low flow conditions and the summer months. There are some mine drainage issues on the creek between Rockwell Avenue and Charles Street. It experiences some flow loss to <b>underground</b> <b>mine</b> voids. In 1978, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources (now known as the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection) estimated that the creek lost 20 to 30 percent of its flow to mines during dry weather. However, the creek is large enough that this does not cause aquatic habitat to be lost. The Chinchilla sewage treatment plant discharges into the creek {{in the vicinity of}} Leggetts Gap. In its lower reaches, the creek is impacted by past mining, urban development, and debris. Stormwater also flows into the Lackawanna River via the creek and it is affected by fine sediment. There is one stormwater detention facility in the watershed, at Leggett's Creek Estates.|$|E
5|$|New mines {{were opened}} in Ahtme (1948), Jõhvi (No. 2, 1949), Sompa (1949), Tammiku (1951), {{and in the}} area between Käva and Sompa (No. 4, 1953). The Küttejõu open-pit mine was closed in 1947 and the Küttejõu <b>underground</b> <b>mine</b> was merged with the Kiviõli mine in 1951. The Ubja mine was closed in 1959. After {{construction}} of large oil shale-fired power stations, demand for oil shale increased and consequently new larger mines were constructed: the underground mines Viru (1965) and Estonia (1972) along with the open-pit mines Sirgala (1963), Narva (1970) and Oktoobri (1974; later named Aidu). Correspondingly, several exhausted smaller mines like Kukruse (1967), Käva (1972), No. 2 (1973), No. 4 (1975), and Kiviõli (1987) were closed. The Estonia Mine became the largest oil shale mine in the world. Because {{of the success of}} oil shale-based power generation, Estonian oil shale mining peaked in 1980 at 31.35million tonnes, and in the same year power generation peaked at 18.9TWh. The industry declined during the subsequent two decades. Demand for electric power generated from oil shale decreased following construction of nuclear power stations in the Russian SFSR, particularly the Leningrad Nuclear Power Station. At the end of 1988, a fire broke out in the Estonia Mine. The largest underground fire in Estonia, it continued for 81days and caused serious pollution of ground and surface waters.|$|E

Historically the lead belt around the Saint Francois Mountains and the Tri-state district lead-zinc mining area around Joplin, Missouri, have been very important sources of metals.
