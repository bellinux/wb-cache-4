5|$|Despite being bred for racing, Whippets can be couch potatoes. When {{not running}} around, {{they are usually}} asleep or cuddled in their owner's lap. They are not prone to {{fighting}} but {{have been known to}} chase small pets, due to their sighthound nature. They also have a tendency to get up on furniture. Whippets are touch sensitive, meaning that they tend to jump or overreact when touched <b>unexpectedly.</b>|$|E
5|$|Disjunct {{populations of}} the giant {{freshwater}} stingray in separate river drainages are probably isolated from one another; though the species occurs in brackish environments, {{there is no evidence}} that it crosses marine waters. This is a bottom-dwelling species that favors a sandy or muddy habitat. <b>Unexpectedly,</b> it can sometimes be found near heavily populated urban areas.|$|E
5|$|Due to the <b>unexpectedly</b> strong {{success of}} the Victory Tests, the {{government}} of Australia ordered the team to delay their demobilisation.

5|$|Edmonton’s native Magic Lantern Theatres <b>unexpectedly</b> {{tried to}} buy the Princess for $500,000 on Christmas Eve 1996.

5|$|Even {{before the}} Hanford Site {{started up the}} B Reactor, {{the first of its}} three reactors, on September 15, 1944, Wheeler had been {{concerned}} that some nuclear fission products {{might turn out to be}} nuclear poisons, the accumulation of which would impede the ongoing nuclear chain reaction by absorbing many of the thermal neutrons that were needed to continue a chain reaction. In an April 1942 report, he predicted that this would reduce the reactivity by less than one percent so long as no fission product had a neutron capture cross section of more than 100,000 barns. After the reactor <b>unexpectedly</b> shut down, and then just as <b>unexpectedly</b> restarted about fifteen hours later, he suspected iodine-135, with a half life of 6.6 hours, and its daughter product, xenon-135, which has a half life of 9.2 hours. Xenon-135 turned out to have a neutron capture cross-section of well over 2 million barns. The problem was corrected by adding additional fuel rods to burn out the poison.|$|E
5|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{reproduction}} most amphibians require fresh water although some lay their eggs on land and have developed various means of keeping them moist. A few (e.g. Fejervarya raja) can inhabit brackish water, {{but there are no}} true marine amphibians. There are reports, however, of particular amphibian populations <b>unexpectedly</b> invading marine waters. Such {{was the case with the}} Black Sea invasion of the natural hybrid Pelophylax esculentus reported in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Geffen's press {{promotion}} for Nevermind {{was lower}} than that typical of a major record label.

5|$|George's grandfather, King George II, {{disliked the}} Prince of Wales, and took little {{interest}} in his grandchildren. However, in 1751 the Prince of Wales died <b>unexpectedly</b> from a lung injury, and George became heir apparent to the throne. He inherited one of his father's titles and became the Duke of Edinburgh. Now more interested in his grandson, three weeks later the King created George Prince of Wales (the title is not automatically acquired).|$|E
5|$|He {{was also}} {{concerned}} by {{reports of the}} invasion of Kiska in the Aleutian Islands in August 1943, in which a large Allied force invaded an island {{that had already been}} evacuated by the Japanese. If this could happen, it was also possible that a force might attack where the Japanese were <b>unexpectedly</b> strong. Different levels of command sometimes came up with widely varying estimates of Japanese strength because they used different methods to estimate it.|$|E
5|$|Highway21 {{is often}} subject to winter {{closures}} due to lake effect caused by snowsquall, which can create sudden whiteout conditions along the Lake Huron shoreline. Several Emergency Detour Routes {{have been established}} further inland to guide drivers around such closures. Care should be taken during the winter months, as these storms can progress rapidly and <b>unexpectedly.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1669, the Jewel House was {{demolished}} and the Crown Jewels {{moved into}} Martin Tower (until 1841). They were displayed here for viewing by the paying public. This was exploited {{two years later}} when Colonel Thomas Blood attempted to steal them. Blood and his accomplices bound and gagged the Jewel House keeper. Although they laid {{their hands on the}} Imperial State Crown, Sceptre and Orb, they were foiled when the keeper's son turned up <b>unexpectedly</b> and raised the alarm.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, Tory leader George A. Drew <b>unexpectedly</b> {{resigned}} due to ill health. In his place, the PC party {{elected the}} fiery and charismatic Diefenbaker. The Tories ran a campaign centred {{on their new}} leader, who attracted large crowds to rallies and made a strong impression on television. The Liberals ran a lacklustre campaign, and St. Laurent made few television appearances. Uncomfortable with the medium, the Prime Minister read his speeches from a script and refused to wear makeup.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Shaftesbury <b>unexpectedly</b> {{moved out}} of the Manor House and {{divorced}} his wife. He left his former wife in charge and passed the running of the estate to his 23-year-old son, Anthony. Christina, Countess of Shaftesbury, and their sons remained in residence in Wimborne StGiles, while the Earl relocated to France, embarking on a string of short-lived and expensive love affairs with younger women distinguished by their exotic looks and equally colorful histories.|$|E
