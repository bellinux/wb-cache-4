5|$|We {{all have}} a Land of Beyond to seek in our life—what more can we ask? Our part {{is to find the}} trail that leads to it. A long trail, a hard trail, maybe; but the call comes to <b>us,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> have to go. Rooted deep in the nature of every one of us is the spirit of adventure, the call of the wild—vibrating under all our actions, making life deeper and higher and nobler.|$|E
5|$|Laurie Mains had {{returned}} from South Africa to coach Otago in the 2001 NPC, and after Peter Sloane moved to the Blues, Mains was appointed the Highlanders coach for 2002. Their season started with a narrow 3028 loss to the Crusaders at Jade Stadium, after leading 2827 at one point. That year the Highlanders also achieved a win over all four South African teams; a Grand Slam {{that they had not}} achieved since 1998. The closest of those four victories was a 2120 win over the Stormers in Cape Town. They also defeated the Brumbies 2518 in Canberra, The Gordon Hunter Memorial Trophy was also introduced that season to be contested between the Highlanders and Blues. Gordon Hunter had coached both teams before dying from cancer in 2001. Highland prop said of the game against the Blues “While I’m sure Gordy was popular in Auckland during his time coaching up there, as he’d seemed to be everywhere he went, the trophy meant a huge amount to <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> were determined to be the first winners to honour his memory”. The match was played at Eden Park, and the Highlanders were ahead 153 at half time, and eventually won 2013. Their last home match of the season was against the Reds at Carisbrook. The Highlanders’ 4026 win meant that they had gone three seasons undefeated at Carisbrook. With their eight victories from the regular season, the Highlanders finished fourth and played the Crusaders in Christchurch in their semi-final. The Crusaders won 3423 although Jeff Wilson did score a try in his last match for the franchise.|$|E

[...] UMNO Information Chief Muhammad Muhammad Taib responded, telling the press that Malaysia implemented policies to assist economically disadvantaged Malays, instead of neglecting them as Singapore did, stating also that at one point the Malays would have to compete on a level playing field with other Malaysians.|$|E

500|$|After {{the match}} City manager Joe Mercer said [...] "the heavy {{rain in the}} second half ruined the game" [...] and that he was [...] "quite happy with the {{performance}} of our team, although the technical level was rather low {{in the second half}}". Górnik manager Michał Matyas blamed his side's poor start, saying the [...] "first goal came too early for <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> never recovered from this shock." [...] The trophy was Manchester City's fourth major honour in three seasons. It made them the third English club to win the Cup Winners' Cup, after Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham United.|$|E
500|$|Not knowing at {{the time}} that he would be {{referring}} to deleted scenes, Andrew Lincoln told Entertainment Weekly, [...] "I remember going on set for the season premiere and seeing a couple of the prop guys, and they just looked at me as they gave me my gun and they went, 'You know, in this episode we kill more zombies than in the whole of Season 1.' They actually counted the kills! And when it came time for the taking-of-the-courtyard scene, that was just carnage." [...] He added, [...] "It really wasn't that well plotted. We just got sent zombies towards <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> had to improvise stabbing, so it was a bit touch-and-go from time to time." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} {{finishers}} {{appeared on the}} podium and in the subsequent press conference.

Other drivers congratulated Vettel; Hamilton said that [...] "with all that pressure it is easier to make mistakes, and he obviously didn't, so congratulations to him. He did a good job." [...] The Grand Prix also marked the first win by Toro Rosso, the first non-Ferrari Italian-based team to win since 1957. Ferrari team principal Stefano Domenicali paid tribute to the team, who use Ferrari engines, saying [...] "They deserve it, they are close to <b>us,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> are happy to work with them because we are giving them our engine." ...|$|E

500|$|What {{is certain}} is that the breed took its name from Clumber Park and that the Duke of Newcastle's gamekeeper, William Mansell, is {{credited}} with their development and improvement. Prince Albert, the Prince consort of Queen Victoria, was a fancier and promoter of the breed, as was his son King Edward VII, who bred them at the Sandringham estate in Norfolk. The breed was shown in England from 1859 onward. They are referred to in Queen Victoria's diary: on October 16, 1840, she wrote, [...] "Walked out directly after breakfast before Albert went to shoot. He had his 7 fine Clumber Spaniels with <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> went into the Slopes, with such a funny old Gamekeeper, Walters, in order that I should see how the dogs found out their game. They are such dear, nice dogs." ...|$|E
500|$|After Ferrari's {{victory at}} the {{previous}} race, their team principal Jean Todt, said that [...] "we {{seemed to be in}} a strong position but, of course, it is the order at the finish that counts", while Michael Schumacher said that his car's tyres dropped in performance after taking his first pit stop. McLaren technical director Adrian Newey said that the pit stop strategy was crucial in winning the race: [...] "The tyre wear did not spring any surprises on <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> were able to trust our estimations and co-ordinate the pit-stops to our best advantage." [...] Villeneuve was happy with his strong finish and was surprised by his good start. Heidfeld, who made contact with his teammate Alesi during the race, apologised for the collision. Ralf Schumacher said that he reduced his pace to secure his fifth position. Trulli described his race as [...] "difficult" [...] because of the hot temperatures though he praised his mechanics for their work.|$|E
500|$|Chamberlain thanked his teammates. [...] "It wouldn't {{even have}} been close to {{possible}} without them. They wanted me to get it as much I did." [...] He added, [...] "They had {{to do more than}} just give up open shots. They had to avoid fouls and pass me the ball in traffic." [...] Knicks' player Richie Guerin felt the Warriors broke a code of honor in sports by embarrassing an opponent and setting a record outside the normal flow of the game. Although effusive in his praise of Chamberlain, Guerin nonetheless estimated that if the game had played out normally, Chamberlain would have finished 15 to 20 points shy of 100. Chamberlain countered he could have scored 140 if the Knicks [...] "had played straight-up basketball." [...] New York coach Eddie Donovan suggested, [...] "The game was a farce. They would foul <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> would foul them." [...] The Knicks' Naulls stated, [...] "The game was not a fluke ... I thought it was absolutely authentic." [...] Imhoff said Zinkoff's announcements did not help the Knicks' cause.|$|E

500|$|Radiohead {{recorded}} {{a version of}} [...] "True Love Waits" [...] for their third album, OK Computer (1997), but discarded it. They worked on it again during the joint sessions for Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001). During this time, guitarist Ed O'Brien kept an online diary of the band's progress, and wrote in January 2000: [...] " [...] has been kicking around for about four years now and each time we approached it we {{seemed to be going}} down the same old paths. It actually sounds like the start of something exciting now." [...] One month later, he wrote: [...] "This is something like approach number 561 but it is a great song. It's simply {{trying to find a way}} of doing it which excites <b>us.</b> <b>And</b> <b>we</b> may have found a way, at the very least we've found a new approach … It may of course be utter crap and we have so lost the plot on this song. Please don't let that be the case." [...] The band failed to find an arrangement that satisfied them, and the song remained unreleased.|$|E
500|$|The allies {{decided to}} divide their forces into two armies: a {{multinational}} force {{that included the}} 1st Division and a second army composed entirely of Brazilians under Caxias. The 1st Division led by Marques de Sousa, along with Uruguayan and Argentine rebel troops, invaded Argentina. He found the long march to Buenos Aires, the Argentine capital, highly uncomfortable. He had spent his life {{up to that point}} fighting Hispanic-Americans, and he was now marching as their ally, surrounded by them. He did not trust them, and they trusted neither him nor his men. The only person among the allies with whom he shared his thoughts, and guardedly at that, was Domingo Faustino Sarmiento (later president of Argentina): [...] "We [...] form in here a separate group; we do not talk to anyone; no one approaches <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> could say that we walk among enemies." [...] On 3 February 1852, in the Battle of Caseros, they faced Rosas and his army. The allies were victorious, Rosas fled to the United Kingdom, and Marques de Sousa acquired his carriage as a war trophy.|$|E
500|$|Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson {{revealed}} that captain Roy Keane {{would return to}} his midfield role after playing in central defence in their win over Juventus: [...] "It took Roy about 15 minutes to settle into Tuesday's game but once he started {{to make sure he}} could see his opponent, he grasped the role very quickly, in the end, he could have played with a bowler hat and white gloves on it was so easy for him. He is a marvellous player and choosing him in defence is certainly an option but Mikaël Silvestre and John O'Shea should be fit and I have a back four in my mind." [...] The final was United's first since the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final and Ferguson was determined to win: That is too long for <b>us,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> are delighted. We have always looked at the League Cup as an extra to blood young players, but the format now has encouraged teams to have a go. We've played Liverpool once in Cardiff – in the Charity Shield – and lost so I hope this time it will be a different result." ...|$|E

500|$|The Ramones {{began playing}} gigs in mid-1974, {{with their first}} show at Performance Studios in New York City. The band, {{performing}} in a style {{similar to the one}} used on their debut album, typically performed at clubs in downtown Manhattan, specifically CBGB and Max's Kansas City. In early 1975, Lisa Robinson, an editor of Hit Parader and Rock Scene, saw the fledgling Ramones performing at CBGB and subsequently wrote about the band in several magazine issues. The group's vocalist Joey Ramone related that [...] "Lisa came down to see us, she was blown away by us. She said that we changed her life, She started writing about us in Rock Scene, and then Lenny Kaye would write about <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> started getting more press like The Village Voice. Word was getting out, and people starting coming down." [...] Convinced that the band needed a recording contract, Robinson contacted Danny Fields, former manager of the Stooges, and argued that he needed to manage the band. Fields agreed because the band [...] "had everything [...] ever liked," [...] and became the manager in November 1975.|$|E
500|$|In the {{campaign}} to revise Congressional instructions, many Americans formally expressed their support for separation from Great Britain in what were effectively state and local declarations of independence. Historian Pauline Maier identifies more than ninety such declarations that were issued throughout the Thirteen Colonies from April to July 1776. These [...] "declarations" [...] took a variety of forms. Some were formal written instructions for Congressional delegations, such as the Halifax Resolves of April 12, with which North Carolina became the first colony to explicitly authorize its delegates to vote for independence. Others were legislative acts that officially ended British rule in individual colonies, such as the Rhode Island legislature declaring its independence from Great Britain on May 4, the first colony to do so. Many [...] "declarations" [...] were resolutions adopted at town or county meetings that offered support for independence. A few {{came in the form}} of jury instructions, such as the statement issued on April 23, 1776 by Chief Justice William Henry Drayton of South Carolina: [...] "the law of the land authorizes me to declare...that George the Third, King of Great Britain...has no authority over <b>us,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> owe no obedience to him." [...] Most of these declarations are now obscure, having been overshadowed by the declaration approved by Congress on July 2, and signed July 4.|$|E
500|$|Singapore has a one person, {{one vote}} system: plural voting– that is, voting {{more than once}} in the electoral {{division}} that one is assigned to, or voting in more than one electoral division– is illegal. Following a relative swing in votes against the ruling People's Action Party government in the general election of 1984, the Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew raised the possibility of modifications to the one person, one vote system and said: [...] "It is necessary to try and put some safeguards into the way in which people use their votes to bargain, coerce, to push, to jostle and get what they want without running the risk of losing the services of the government, because one day, by mistake, they will lose the services of the government." [...] Subsequently, in an interview to the US magazine Foreign Affairs in January 1994, Lee, now Senior Minister, suggested that a person between the ages of 40 and 60 with a family should be given two votes because [...] "he is likely to be more careful, voting also for his children. He is more likely to vote in a serious way than a capricious young man under 30. But we haven't found it necessary yet. If it became necessary, we should do it. ... I'm not intellectually convinced that one-man, one-vote is the best. We practise it because that's what the British bequeathed <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> haven't really found a need to challenge that."
