50|$|The {{larger the}} ratio of sprung <b>weight</b> to <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight,</b> the less the body and vehicle {{occupants}} are affected by bumps, dips, and other surface imperfections such as small bridges. However, a large sprung <b>weight</b> to <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> ratio can also be deleterious to vehicle control.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{method used}} is {{to replace the}} cast iron {{friction}} brake assembly with a wheel motor assembly of similar weight. This results in no net gain in <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> and a car capable of braking up to 1G. [...] A {{good example of this}} is the Michelin Active Wheel motor as fitted to the Heuliez Will that results in an <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> of 35 kg on the front axle which compares favorably to a small car such as a Renault Clio that has 38 kg of <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> on its front axle.|$|R

5000|$|Lower <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> as {{only the}} halfshafts are carried, not the centre {{differential}} of an axle.|$|R
50|$|Inboard brakes (which reduce <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight)</b> are {{probably}} avoided more due to space considerations than to cost.|$|R
50|$|Lighter (mostly {{aluminum}} or magnesium alloy) wheels improve handling {{as well as}} ride comfort, by lessening <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight.</b>|$|R
5000|$|So the [...] "wheel bounce" [...] due {{to wheel}} inertia, or {{resonant}} {{motion of the}} <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> {{moving up and down}} on the springiness of the tire, is only poorly damped, mainly by the dampers or shock absorbers of the suspension. For these reasons, high <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> reduces road holding and increases unpredictable changes in direction on rough surfaces (as well as degrading ride comfort and increasing mechanical loads).|$|R
50|$|This <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> {{includes}} the wheels and tires, usually the brakes, plus some {{percentage of the}} suspension, {{depending on how much}} of the suspension moves with the body and how much with the wheels; for instance a solid axle suspension is completely unsprung. The main factors that improve <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> are a sprung differential (as opposed to live axle) and inboard brakes. (The De Dion tube suspension operates much as a live axle does, but represents an improvement because the differential is mounted to the body, thereby reducing the <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight.)</b> Wheel materials and sizes will also have an effect. Aluminium alloy wheels are common due to their weight characteristics which help to reduce unsprung mass. Magnesium alloy wheels are even lighter but corrode easily.|$|R
50|$|Reduced <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> {{compared}} to the Hotchkiss drive (live axle), since the differential and half-shafts {{are connected to the}} chassis.|$|R
50|$|The {{geometry}} and high (relative to total) <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> gave it some bump steer, which owners sometimes treated {{by moving the}} supports forward and lengthening the trailing arms.|$|R
5000|$|The {{steering}} 'feel' is more numbed than a RWD car. This {{is due to}} {{the extra}} weight of drive shafts and CV joint components that increase <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cars with {{relatively}} soft suspension and with low <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> are least affected by uneven surfaces, while on flat smooth surfaces the stiffer the better. Unexpected water, ice, oil, etc. are hazards.|$|R
50|$|Radius rods are customarily made of stamped {{steel or}} {{aluminum}} for lightness, {{as they are}} part of the vehicle's <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight.</b> Improvements in composite materials technology make possible plastic suspension links, although they are still uncommon.|$|R
25|$|A serious {{design fault}} in these {{locomotives}} was their very high <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> of 33 tons. Geared motors {{had not been}} used as it was {{thought they would be}} noisy in the confines of a tunnel. This resulted in serious problems with noise and vibration. Complaints from local residents started immediately after the service commenced and were such that the Board of Trade imposed a speed limit until modifications could be made. This was achieved by only using series mode on the controller, but by 1901, three of the locomotives had been rebuilt with new bogies and nose-suspended GE55 motors, reducing the <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> to 11 tons.|$|R
50|$|Hub gears {{tend to be}} {{heavier than}} {{derailleur}} systems with equivalent gearing characteristics, and the additional weight is concentrated at the back wheel. On rear-suspension bicycles in sporting use this <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> may adversely affect traction and braking.|$|R
50|$|As {{they require}} a heavier {{and more complex}} hub assembly, however, these systems can result in an {{increased}} <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> and require robust axle-control elements to give predictable handling. In addition, at higher speeds the hub assembly can overheat.|$|R
5000|$|Buell designs {{focus on}} {{providing}} good handling, comfortable riding, easy maintenance, and street-friendly real-world performance. Buell motorcycles were engineered {{with an emphasis}} on what they called the [...] "Trilogy of Tech": mass centralization, low <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight,</b> and frame rigidity.|$|R
50|$|The major {{disadvantage}} of wheel hub motors {{are that the}} weight of the electric motors would increase the <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight,</b> which adversely affects handling and ride (the wheels are more sluggish in responding to road conditions, especially fast motions over bumps, and transmit the bumps to the chassis instead of absorbing them). Most conventional electric motors include ferrous material composed of laminated electrical steel. This ferrous material contributes most of the weight of electric motors. To minimize this weight several recent wheel motor designs have minimized the electrical steel content of the motor by utilizing a coreless design with Litz wire coil windings to reduce eddy current losses. This significantly reduces wheel motor <b>weight</b> and therefore <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight.</b>|$|R
50|$|In-wheel motors {{offer the}} {{benefits}} of drastically improved vehicle packaging, simplified two-wheel or all-wheel-drive layouts, the option of through-the-road hybridization, more efficient regenerative braking, and the most direct wheel control possible. The downside is added <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> which can impact handling performance.|$|R
5000|$|In a front engine, {{rear-drive}} vehicle, dependent {{rear suspension}} is either [...] "live axle" [...] or deDion axle, {{depending on whether}} or not the differential is carried on the axle. Live axle is simpler but the <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> contributes to wheel bounce.|$|R
25|$|Many early {{implementations}} for automobiles {{located the}} brakes on the inboard side of the driveshaft, near the differential, while most brakes today are located inside the wheels. An inboard location reduces the <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> and eliminates a source of heat transfer to the tires.|$|R
50|$|The first {{electric}} locomotives used large diameter electric motors, mounted rigidly on their frames and using jackshaft drives and coupling rods {{to carry their}} torque to the driving wheels. This increased their <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> and limited their maximum speed, despite the greater power of {{electric locomotives}}.|$|R
5000|$|Weight - Brakes {{are often}} [...] "added weight" [...] {{in that they}} serve no other function. Further, brakes are often mounted on wheels, and <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> can {{significantly}} hurt traction in some circumstances. [...] "Weight" [...] may mean the brake itself, or may include additional support structure.|$|R
25|$|The most {{important}} modification was the fitting of a stronger rear differential {{to handle the}} increased engine power. A Salisbury 4HU unit with inboard disc brakes to reduce <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> was chosen instead of the old E.N.V. unit. It was the same unit used on the Jaguar E-Type.|$|R
50|$|The {{brake discs}} are carbon ceramic, which shaves a {{significant}} 12.5 kg from the <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight.</b> At the front, there are 398 mm ventilated and drilled brakes with 6-piston alloy monobloc calipers. At the back, there are 360 mm ventilated and drilled brakes with 4-piston alloy monobloc calipers.|$|R
50|$|The {{key reason}} for lower <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> {{relative}} to a live axle design is that, for driven wheels, the differential unit does not form part of the unsprung elements of the suspension system. Instead it is either bolted directly to the vehicle's chassis or more commonly to a subframe.|$|R
5000|$|A single {{transverse}} {{leaf spring}} for both front wheels and/or both back wheels, supporting solid axles, was used by Ford Motor Company, before and soon after World War II, even on expensive models. It had the advantages of simplicity and low <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> (compared to other solid axle designs).|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to simplicity lightness and compact shape, {{at least in}} some directions, since only the small end of the spring was attached to the wheel, it gave low <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight.</b> In {{addition to}} its contribution to ride and handling, this reduced wheel bearing loads and therefore allowed smaller cheaper bearings.|$|R
50|$|Total {{wheel weight}} (tire & rim) {{is part of}} the <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> of the vehicle and will have a great effect on {{traction}} while traveling over uneven terrain as the wheel can respond quicker (lighter weight) to terrain changes. This allows the wheel {{to get back on the}} ground more quickly.|$|R
50|$|<b>Unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> {{transfer}} is calculated {{based on the}} weight of the vehicle's components that are not supported by the springs. This includes tires, wheels, brakes, spindles, half the control arm's weight and other components. These components are then (for calculation purposes) assumed to be connected to a vehicle with zero sprung weight. They are then put through the same dynamic loads. The weight transfer for cornering in the front would be equal to the total <b>unsprung</b> front <b>weight</b> times the G-Force times the front unsprung center of gravity height divided by the front track width. The same is true for the rear.|$|R
40|$|Weight {{reduction}} {{has been}} the main/primary focus of automobile manufactures. Suspension leaf spring, a potential item for weight reduction in automobiles, accounts for 10 - 25 percent of <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight,</b> (which {{is considered to be}} the mass not supported by leaf spring). Application of composite materials reduces the weight of leaf spring without an...|$|R
50|$|Automobile {{suspensions}} {{have many}} variable characteristics, which are generally {{different in the}} front and rear and all of which affect handling. Some of these are: spring rate, damping, straight ahead camber angle, camber change with wheel travel, roll center height and the flexibility and vibration modes of the suspension elements. Suspension also affects <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight.</b>|$|R
50|$|Since this {{placement}} of the gearbox is unsuitable for a live axle (due to excessive <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight),</b> the rear suspension is either independent, or uses a de Dion tube (notably in Alfa Romeos). Rare exceptions to this rule were the Bugatti T46 and T50 which had a three speed gearbox on a live axle.|$|R
50|$|For {{the rear}} suspension, Lotus {{originally}} used a live axle (or solid axle). This approach was very cost effective since most production saloon cars {{up to the}} 1980s used these components. A mixture of Ford and Austin (Rover) components were used. One disadvantage of live axles is higher <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight,</b> affecting handling and ride on rough surfaces.|$|R
