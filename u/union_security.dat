25|$|Comprehensive {{campaigns are}} not limited to organizing, however. They may also be aimed at winning an initial or {{successor}} collective bargaining agreement, or to achieve a collective bargaining goal or goals (such as a <b>union</b> <b>security</b> clause). Comprehensive campaigns have also been used to prevent plant closings, prevent plant openings, or to encourage the employer to take some action (such as opposing a business competitor, withdrawing support for legislation, etc.).|$|E
25|$|The {{amendments}} also authorized {{individual states}} to outlaw <b>union</b> <b>security</b> clauses (such as the union shop) entirely in their jurisdictions by passing right-to-work laws. A right-to-work law, under Section 14B of Taft–Hartley, prevents unions from negotiating contracts or legally binding documents requiring companies to fire workers {{who refuse to}} join the union. Currently all of {{the states in the}} Deep South and a number of states in the Midwest, Great Plains, and Rocky Mountains regions have right-to-work laws (with six states—Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Mississippi, and Oklahoma—going one step further and enshrining right-to-work laws in their states' constitutions).|$|E
25|$|The duty {{applies to}} {{virtually}} every action that a union might take {{in dealing with}} an employer as the representative of employees, from its negotiation {{of the terms of}} a collective bargaining agreement, to its handling of grievances arising under that agreement, as well as its operation of an exclusive hiring hall and its enforcement of the <b>union</b> <b>security</b> provisions of a collective bargaining agreement. However, the duty does not ordinarily apply to rights that a worker can enforce independently; the union has no duty to assist the employees it represents in filing claims under a workers' compensation statute or other laws.|$|E

25|$|The Aračinovo crisis {{triggered}} ever stronger diplomatic {{pressure on}} the Macedonian government, from NATO and the EU, for a political resolution of the conflict. The attention that the Aračinovo crisis attracted {{was so great that}} NATO Secretary-General George Robertson, and the European <b>Union</b> <b>security</b> chief Javier Solana, visited Macedonia to bolster efforts for a political solution to the conflict. The crisis also widened the divide within the government on the matter of the approach toward resolving the conflict. The Prime Minister and the Minister of Interior were in favour of a continuation of the successful offensives from March and May 2001, whereas the President was pushing for a political solution.|$|E
25|$|The outlawed closed shops were {{contractual}} {{agreements that}} required an employer to hire only labor union members.

The National Labor Relations Board and the courts have added other restrictions on the power of unions to enforce <b>union</b> <b>security</b> clauses and have required them to make extensive financial disclosures to all members as part of their duty of fair representation. On the other hand, Congress repealed the provisions requiring a vote by workers to authorize a union shop a few years after the passage of the Act when it became apparent that workers were approving them in virtually every case.|$|E
25|$|All {{the major}} unions grew {{stronger}} during the war. The government {{put pressure on}} employers to recognize unions to avoid the sort of turbulent struggles over union recognition of the 1930s, while unions were generally able to obtain maintenance of membership clauses, a form of <b>union</b> <b>security,</b> through arbitration and negotiation. Employers gave workers new untaxed benefits (such as vacation time, pensions, and health insurance), which increased real incomes even when wage rates were frozen. The wage differential between higher skilled and less skilled workers narrowed, and with the enormous increase in overtime for blue collar wage workers (at time and a half pay), incomes in working class households shot up, while the salaried middle class lost ground.|$|E

25|$|The Act {{revised the}} Wagner Act's {{requirement}} of employer neutrality, to allow employers to deliver anti-union messages in the workplace. These changes confirmed an earlier Supreme Court ruling that employers {{have a constitutional}} right to express their opposition to unions, so long as they did not threaten employees with reprisals for their union activities nor offer any incentives to employees as an alternative to unionizing. The amendments also gave employers the right to file a petition asking the Board to determine if a union represents a majority of its employees, and allow employees to petition either to decertify their union, or to invalidate the <b>union</b> <b>security</b> provisions of any existing collective bargaining agreement.|$|E
25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of June 14, the Associated Press reported an explosion that rocked Gaza City.

The EU staff had, at that time, already been relocated to the Israeli city of Ashkelon for safety reasons. On June 14, Abbas dissolved the Palestinian-Hamas unity government, on 15 June, Hamas completed the control over Gaza.|$|E
25|$|Into this divided community, {{the mine}} owners hired spies {{to monitor and}} {{undermine}} the union.

Although everyone knew that there were spies in the union (the details of secret union leadership meetings were printed the following day in the Leadville Herald Democrat), they never guessed their identities. Spies were entrusted with <b>union</b> <b>security</b> responsibilities, even with the responsibility of detecting possible spies. The spies faithfully recorded information about ethnic rivalries and philosophical disputes among die-hard and disillusioned unionists, militants and pacifists, optimists and pessimists, and the spy agencies passed that information on to the mine operators. With comprehensive daily reports on secret union meetings and the union's tactical plans, mine owners were able to outwit, outmaneuver, and outlast the strikers.|$|E

25|$|The Act outlawed closed shops, {{which were}} {{contractual}} agreements that required an employer to hire only union members. Union shops, in which new recruits must join the union {{within a certain}} amount of time, are permitted, but only as part of a collective bargaining agreement and only if the contract allows the worker at least thirty days after the date of hire or the effective date of the contract to join the union. The National Labor Relations Board and the courts have added other restrictions on the power of unions to enforce <b>union</b> <b>security</b> clauses and have required them to make extensive financial disclosures to all members as part of their duty of fair representation.

25|$|In {{recent years}} {{the courts and the}} National Labor Relations Board have applied the duty of fair {{representation}} to regulate the manner in which unions enforce the <b>union</b> <b>security</b> provisions of a collective bargaining agreement. Unlike the standard applied to unions' decisions concerning grievance handling and collective bargaining negotiations, the courts and the Board have regulated this area very extensively. They have specified the types of expenses that a union can include in the fees that it charges employees who choose not to join the union but are required to pay dues under an agency shop or union shop clause, the accounting procedures used to calculate those amounts, the procedures which the union and employees must follow if an individual worker objects to paying the full amount of dues or challenges the union's calculation of the lesser amount that non-members can be required to pay, and the procedures that the union must follow before it can force the employer to fire an employee for non-payment of dues. Even stricter standards are applied to unions covered by the Railway Labor Act and to unions of governmental employees on constitutional grounds.|$|E
500|$|The Soviet Union {{launched}} a large military build-up in 1965 by expanding both nuclear and conventional arsenals. The Soviet leadership believed a strong military {{would be useful}} leverage in negotiating with foreign powers, and increase the Eastern Bloc's security from attacks. In the 1970s, the Soviet leadership concluded that a war with the capitalist countries might not necessarily become nuclear, and therefore they initiated a rapid expansion of the country's conventional forces. Due to the country's weaker infrastructure compared to the United States, the Soviet leadership believed {{that the only way}} to beat the First World was by a rapid military conquest of Western Europe, relying on sheer numbers alone. The Soviet Union achieved nuclear parity with the United States by the early 1970s, after which the country consolidated itself as a superpower. The apparent success of the military build-up led the Soviet leadership to believe that the military, and the military alone, according to Willard Frank, [...] "bought the Soviet <b>Union</b> <b>security</b> and influence".|$|E
