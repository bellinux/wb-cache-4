5|$|Global {{warming is}} likely to affect malaria transmission, but the {{severity}} and geographic distribution of such effects is <b>uncertain.</b>|$|E
5|$|Guepinia is {{variously}} {{classified in the}} Auriculariales order, with <b>uncertain</b> familial position (incertae sedis), {{or as part of}} the Exidiaceae family.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>uncertain</b> {{whether a}} {{building}} {{stood on the}} site of the citadel before the 11th century AD. The Ghouta, the wider area in which Damascus is located, has been occupied since at least 9000 BC, but there is no evidence for settlement within the area that is today enclosed by the city walls before the 1st millennium BC. The area occupied by the later citadel was most likely outside this first settlement. The presence of a citadel during the Hellenistic period is <b>uncertain.</b> Damascus certainly had a citadel during the Roman period, but whether it was located {{on the site of}} the present citadel is <b>uncertain</b> and subject to scholarly debate.|$|E

5|$|P. labiata {{does not}} prey on ants, but is preyed {{on by the}} ants Oecophylla smaragdina and Odontomachus sp. (species <b>uncertain).</b>|$|E
5|$|The symbols ? and : {{may also}} be used if the correct {{classification}} is <b>uncertain.</b>|$|E
5|$|Though {{the true}} {{dimensions}} of species diversity remain <b>uncertain,</b> estimates range from 2.6–7.8 million species {{with a mean}} of 5.5 million.|$|E
5|$|<b>Uncertain</b> of its meaning, Monteagle {{delivered}} {{it to the}} English Secretary of State, Robert Cecil.|$|E
5|$|Until {{more data}} become available, the phylogenetic {{position}} of Tiktaalik and other elpistostegids remains <b>uncertain.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{divalent}} oxide BkO {{has been}} reported as a brittle gray solid with a face centered cubic (fcc) structure and a lattice constant a = 496.4 pm, but its exact chemical composition is <b>uncertain.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} other {{references}} were used to provide information on specific topics, including rare vagrants, post-1990 additions, predictions, species claimed but not accepted / species of <b>uncertain</b> provenance, non-natives, taxonomic matters and species found only in the Channel Islands.|$|E
5|$|A {{separate}} {{manifestation of}} the Christmas truce in December 1914 occurred on the Eastern front, where the first move originated from the Austro-Hungarian commanders, at some <b>uncertain</b> level of the military hierarchy. The Russians responded positively and soldiers eventually met in no man’s land.|$|E
5|$|Actinium hydride was {{obtained}} by reduction of actinium trichloride with potassium at 300°C, and its structure was deduced by analogy with the corresponding LaH2 hydride. The source of hydrogen in the reaction was <b>uncertain.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{the final}} {{examinations}} at Ibadan in 1953, Achebe {{was awarded a}} second-class degree. Rattled by not receiving the highest level, he was <b>uncertain</b> how to proceed after graduation. He returned to his hometown of Ogidi to sort through his options.|$|E
5|$|Apart from {{underwater}} ecosystem, Weh {{island is}} the only habitat of one threatened species of toad, Duttaphrynus valhallae (formerly Bufo valhallae). The species is only known from the holotype from the island. Due to heavy forestation on the island, {{the survival of the}} species is <b>uncertain.</b>|$|E
5|$|As of 2016, the {{black-necked grebe}} is {{classified}} as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The trend {{of the population is}} <b>uncertain,</b> as some populations are decreasing, whereas others are stable, have an <b>uncertain</b> trend, or are increasing. The justification for the current classification of this species is its very large population (estimated around 3.9–4.2 million individuals) combined with a large estimated extent of occurrence (about 155 million km2 (60 million sq mi)). This grebe is probably the most numerous grebe in the world.|$|E
5|$|Back in England, {{having just}} been crowned King, James feels that {{everything}} is going his way, but then Murdoch breaks into his chamber and warns him in no <b>uncertain</b> terms of the consequences should anything happen to Fury, or Murdoch's native Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Batavier IIs {{whereabouts}} {{and activities}} {{over the next}} ten months are <b>uncertain.</b> She remained under German control for a time, but how long is not clear from sources. Batavier II was back under Dutch control by late July 1917.|$|E
5|$|During the off-season, Predators owner Craig Leipold put {{the team}} up for sale; {{two of the}} leading {{candidates}} to buy the franchise both had plans to relocate the team. With Kariya's contract expiring, {{he chose not to}} re-sign with Nashville, citing the team's <b>uncertain</b> future.|$|E
5|$|Eta Carinae is {{a unique}} object, with no very close analogues {{currently}} known in any galaxy. Therefore, its future evolution is highly <b>uncertain,</b> but almost certainly involves further mass loss and an eventual supernova.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{for using}} {{spirometry}} among those without symptoms {{in an effort}} to diagnose the condition earlier is of <b>uncertain</b> effect and is therefore currently not recommended.|$|E
5|$|Francium is an {{alkali metal}} whose {{chemical}} properties mostly {{resemble those of}} caesium. A heavy element with a single valence electron, it has the highest equivalent weight of any element. Liquid francium—if created—should have a surface tension of 0.05092N/m at its melting point. Francium's melting point was calculated to be around 27°C (80°F, 300K). The melting point is <b>uncertain</b> because of the element's extreme rarity and radioactivity. Thus, the estimated boiling point value of 677°C (1250°F, 950K) is also <b>uncertain.</b>|$|E
5|$|In February 1549, after {{spending}} a total of 19 months in the galley-prison, Knox was released. It is <b>uncertain</b> how he obtained his liberty. Later in the year, Henry II arranged with Edward VI of England the release of all remaining Castilian prisoners.|$|E
5|$|In May 2007, Birmingham's board agreed a new {{contract}} for Bruce, but the unwillingness of the club's prospective purchaser Carson Yeung to ratify it left his future <b>uncertain.</b> In October 2007, Bolton Wanderers were refused permission {{to speak to him}} about their managerial vacancy.|$|E
5|$|In {{people with}} stable OHS, the most {{important}} treatment is weight loss—by diet, through exercise, with medication, or sometimes weight loss surgery (bariatric surgery). This {{has been shown to}} improve the symptoms of OHS and resolution of the high carbon dioxide levels. Weight loss may take a long time and is not always successful. Bariatric surgery is avoided if possible, given the high rate of complications, but may be considered if other treatment modalities are ineffective in improving oxygen levels and symptoms. If the symptoms are significant, nighttime positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment is tried; this involves the use of a machine to assist with breathing. PAP exists in various forms, and the ideal strategy is <b>uncertain.</b> Some medications have been tried to stimulate breathing or correct underlying abnormalities; their benefit is again <b>uncertain.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the Philippines, P. labiata {{does not}} prey on ants, but is preyed {{on by the}} ants Oecophylla smaragdina and Odontomachus sp. (species <b>uncertain),</b> and a solitary Odontomachus has been seen attacking a P. labiata. In a test the ant Diacamma vagans usually killed single-handed a P. labiata.|$|E
5|$|Into {{this world}} was born George Mason, fourth of that name, on December 11, 1725. He {{may have been}} born at his father's {{plantation}} on Dogue's Neck (later Mason Neck), but this is <b>uncertain</b> as his parents also lived on their lands across the Potomac in Maryland.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>uncertain</b> {{when the}} first {{fortification}} at Longtown was built. The first defences may have been built during either the Iron Age or Roman, or Anglo-Saxon periods, but this remains <b>uncertain.</b> If Roman defences were constructed at the site, it was probably because of a Roman road that may have run nearby, and the defences may well have then been reused {{in the building of}} the current castle, parts of whose earthworks have square, angular corners, similar to those of Roman forts but otherwise unusual in 12th century English castles.|$|E
5|$|Karo Parisyan's next {{fight was}} to be against American Kickboxing Academy's Josh Koscheck at UFC 98. However, due to Parisyan's nine-month {{suspension}} from the NSAC for a failed drug test due to painkillers, {{the future of this}} fight is <b>uncertain.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{is present}} in {{biological}} systems in trace amounts; its functions are <b>uncertain.</b> Lithium salts {{have proven to be}} useful as a mood-stabilizing drug in the treatment of bipolar disorder in humans.|$|E
5|$|Middle Devonian basaltic {{volcanic}} {{rocks are}} found on western Hoy, on Deerness in eastern Mainland and on Shapinsay. Correlation between the Hoy volcanics {{and the other}} two exposures has been proposed, but differences in chemistry means this remains <b>uncertain.</b> Lamprophyre dykes of Late Permian age are found throughout Orkney.|$|E
5|$|More or less {{contemporary}} dinosaur genera of {{the area}} included Prosaurolophus, Scolosaurus, Hypacrosaurus, Einiosaurus and tyrannosaurids of <b>uncertain</b> classification. As proven by tooth marks, horned dinosaur fossils in the Landslide Butte Field Area had been scavenged by a large theropod predator, which Rogers suggested were Albertosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Peart {{had been}} {{suffering}} from chronic tendonitis and shoulder problems. Peart's bandmates have confirmed Rush's retirement from touring, although the band's future as a whole remains <b>uncertain.</b>|$|E
5|$|Shama was <b>uncertain</b> {{about the}} {{identity}} of Kanhopatra's father, but suspected {{that it was the}} town's head-man Sadashiva Malagujar. Kanhopatra spent her childhood in the palatial house of her mother, served by several maids, but because of her mother's profession, Kanhopatra's social status was demeaningly low.|$|E
5|$|Sherwood {{was born}} in 1660 to John and Susan White. John White was a {{carpenter}} and farmer of Scottish descent; it is <b>uncertain</b> whether he {{was born in}} America. Susan was English by birth; their daughter Grace was born in Virginia, probably in Pungo.|$|E
