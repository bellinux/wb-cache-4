40|$|In deep {{geological}} disposal for high-level radioactive waste, the generated gas can potentially affect the sealing ability of bentonite buffers. There is a competition between water and gas: the former provides sealing by swelling bentonite, {{and the latter}} attempts to desaturate the bentonite buffer. Thus, this study focused on numerically modelling the coupling effects of water and gas on the water saturation and sealing efficiency of compacted bentonite-sand samples. Different gas pressures were applied to the top surface of an <b>upper</b> <b>sample,</b> whereas the water pressure on the bottom side of the lower sample was maintained at 4 [*]MPa. The results indicated that gas pressure did not significantly affect the saturation of the bentonite-sand sample until 2 [*]MPa. At 2 [*]MPa, the degree of water saturation of the <b>upper</b> <b>sample</b> was close to 1. 0. As the gas pressure increased, this influence was more apparent. When the gas pressure was 6 [*]MPa or higher, {{it was difficult for}} the <b>upper</b> <b>sample</b> to become fully saturated. Additionally, the lower sample was desaturated due to the high gas pressure. This indicated that gas pressure {{played an important role in}} the water saturation process and can affect the sealing efficiency of bentonite-based buffer materials...|$|E

Based on geomorphological evidence, three coring sites wereidentified close to the Ultevis plateau in Norrbotten, {{northern}} Sweden. Sediment coring wascarried out in two pre-Late Weichselian stream channels and in a sediment basin. Stratigraphyfrom one of the sites, a 100 meter wide meltwater channel, was chosen for further analysis. Thestudied core was 5, 93 m long and ended in a lower till unit. The core contained silt and sandbelow an upper till unit, indicating presence of interstadial sediments in the stratigraphy. Thecore was subsampled for luminescence dating.

40|$|The {{interplay of}} rock hardness, tectonic uplift, {{sediment}} supply, flood discharge, and flood periodicity {{lead to the}} overall landscape topography through local bedrock incision and sediment coverage effects. Rock weathering causes decreased rock strength through chemical and physical processes. This decreased rock strength should affect channel erosion rates, and therefore be accounted for in landscape evolution models Sklar (2001) investigates these processes via a saltation-hop erosion mill. However, experiments were made upon freshly cut rock surfaces. This study seeks to improve upon the Sklar data set by accounting {{for the effects of}} bedrock weathering. To this end, saltation-hop erosion mill experiments have been conducted on naturally weathered thalweg and flood level rock surfaces. Sample sites include bedrock channels in sandstone, basalt, granite, and metamorphic lithologies. Erosion rates from the naturally weathered flood level and thalweg surface are then compared with the erosion rate from a fresh saw cut surface. We find that the flood level or 2 ̆ 7 upper 2 ̆ 7 samples produce erosion rates a factor of 1. 5 - 6. 6 higher than for thalweg samples where material has been removed.

40|$|Abstract: The Dunnage zone {{of central}} Newfoundland records {{the closing of}} an oceanic tract — the Iapetus Ocean. Within this tract, the Red Indian line {{separates}} arc terranes developed close to Laurentia (Notre Dame subzone) from those associ-ated with the peri-Gondwanan terrane Ganderia (Exploits subzone). Sandstones and conglomerates of the Badger Group were deposited on the Exploits subzone, southeast of the Red Indian line, from Late Ordovician (Katian) to early Silurian (Llandovery) time. Two samples were collected from the base and top of the Badger Group for detrital zircon U/Pb dating. The lower sample yielded detrital zircon populations with a large statistical peak at ca. 1. 0 Ga, and other features character-istic of derivation from Laurentian sources. Paleozoic zircons with ages from Late Cambrian to Late Ordovician were prob-ably derived from the Notre Dame arc on the margin of Laurentia. The <b>upper</b> <b>sample</b> yielded a comparable age distribution, but with a much smaller proportion of Mesoproterozoic relative to Paleozoic detrital zircon. These results date the earliest arrival of Laurentia-derived detritus on the peri-Gondwanan Exploits subzone crust in the early Katian (ca. 455 Ma). How-ever, the absence, in both samples, of Neoproterozoic grains suggests that {{there was still a}} seaway separating the Gander margin from arc terranes accreted to Laurentia until at least the middle Llandovery (ca. 436 Ma) ...|$|E

The mass loss of the samples at different time is recorded. The surface structure of the oxidation films on the surface of cast iron was analyzed by X-ray diffraction apparatus. The experimental results show that mass loss of the <b>upper</b> <b>sample</b> is more than that of the lower sample. The maximum of mass loss occurred when the distance between the samples is about 1. 0 mm. Oxidation films form {{on the surface of the}} cast iron in pure water and cannot form on the surface of cast iron in mixed solution. The XRD results show that the oxidation film mainly consists of Fe 2 O 3 phase at 50 °C, Fe 3 O 4 phase at 80 °C. The mass loss at 50 °C is less than that at 80 °C. Oxidation film of Fe 2 O 3 phase has some advantages to decelerate the cavitation erosion. Mass loss of the sample of cast iron in mixed solution is less than that in pure water at 80 °C. This phenomenon indicates that formation of the oxidation films plays a more important role in cavitation erosion to reduce or increase mass loss of the cast iron samples...|$|E

Tephrochronology has not yet been applied to archaeological investigations in Norway because tephra are generally not found as visible layers, but are present as very low concentrations of glass shards (i. e. cryptotephra). In this study, we present results from the analysis of cryptotephras found in an Iron Age boathouse in northern Norway. The boathouse was associated with the chieftain center at Borg on Vestvågøy in the Lofoten Islands. In 2003, a trench was excavated and the stratigraphy of the boathouse was described. Radiocarbon ages from cultural deposits show that it was constructed in the Early Iron Age c. AD 540 e 660 and the main period of use {{was at the end of}} the Iron Age between c.

The perimeter of the column-shaped sample is fixed in a steel cylinder with the <b>upper</b> <b>sample</b> surface open to the atmosphere. The lower surface of the sample and the cylinder form an air chamber. A water manometer {{is connected to the}} air chamber to measure the air pressure inside after the chamber is pressurized. The data of pressure versus time in the air chamber are recorded and analyzed. An approximate analytical solution is derived to describe the pressure–time relationship in the air chamber. The air permeability can be easily estimated using the approximate analytical solution based on the linear least-squares fitting to the recorded pressure–time test data. This method is used to estimate the falling-pressure test data of 15 asphalt samples. The agreement between the test data and the analytical prediction is satisfactory for all the samples. To investigate the error caused by the approximate analytical solution, the air permeabilities are also estimated based on fully numerical solutions. The permeability values obtained from analytical and numerical solutions are very close. The maximum relative error is less than 6 % for samples with more than five pressure–time records. A quantitative condition is given under which the analytical solution applies with negligible estimation error.

40|$|Background: Invasive methods {{requiring}} {{general anaesthesia}} {{are needed to}} sample the lung microbiota in young children who do not expectorate. This poses substantial challenges to longitudinal study of paediatric airway microbiota. Non-invasive <b>upper</b> airway <b>sampling</b> is an alternative method for monitoring airway microbiota; however, there are limited data describing the relationship of such results with lung microbiota in young children. In this study, we compared {{the upper and lower}} airway microbiota in young children to determine whether non-invasive <b>upper</b> airway <b>sampling</b> procedures provide a reliable measure of either lung microbiota or clinically defined differences. Results: The microbiota in oropharyngeal (OP) swabs, nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from 78 children (median age 2. 2 years) with and without lung disease were characterised using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) detected significant differences between the microbiota in BAL and those in both OP swabs (p[*]=[*] 0. 0001, Pseudo-F[*]=[*] 12. 2, df[*]=[*] 1) and NP swabs (p[*]=[*] 0. 0001; Pseudo-F[*]=[*] 21. 9, df[*]=[*] 1) with the NP and BAL microbiota more different than the OP and BAL, as indicated by a higher Pseudo-F value. The microbiota in combined OP and NP data (upper airways) provided a more comprehensive representation of BAL microbiota, but significant differences between the upper airway and BAL microbiota remained, albeit with a considerably smaller Pseudo-F (PERMANOVA p[*]=[*] 0. 0001; Pseudo-F[*]=[*] 4. 9, df[*]=[*] 1). Despite this overall difference, paired BAL and upper airway (OP and NP) microbiota were > 50 % similar among 69 % of children. Furthermore, canonical analysis of principal coordinates (CAP analysis) detected significant differences between the microbiota from clinically defined groups when analysing either BAL (eigenvalues > 0. 8; misclassification rate 26. 5 %) or the combined OP and NP data (eigenvalues > 0. 8; misclassification rate 12. 2 %). Conclusions: <b>Upper</b> airway <b>sampling</b> provided an imperfect, but reliable, representation of the BAL microbiota for most children in this study. We recommend inclusion of both OP and NP specimens when non-invasive <b>upper</b> airway <b>sampling</b> is needed to assess airway microbiota in young children who do not expectorate.

Turbellaria was the only taxa to have a significant positive relationship with zebra mussel density and biomass, Simuliidae had a positive, non-significant relationship with both. No macroinvertebrate taxa decreased because of zebra mussel density/biomasss. The other objectives of this study were to compare current macroinvertebrate communities in the Muskegon River and Bigelow Creek, as well as between the 1998 and 2011 samples. Benthic samples were taken at six sites (in summer and fall) in a 22. 5 km reach downstream of Croton Dam of the Muskegon River, and two sites on Bigelow Creek, using Hess samples and five-rock clusters. Macroinvertebrate community richness, EPT richness, Shannon-Wiener diversity, and evenness were calculated for each site, as well as zebra mussel densities. Macroinvertebrate and zebra mussel densities were highest in the <b>upper</b> <b>sample</b> sites on the Muskegon River. Macroinvertebrate production shifted from the mid-river sites in 1998 to the upper sites near Croton Dam in 2011 on the Muskegon River. Cheumatopsyche increases in the Muskegon River were the driving taxa in community changes from 1998 to 2011. Bigelow Creek also experienced changes between the 1998 and 2011 samples, primarily due to a shift in taxa from Protoptila and Hydropsychidae to Baetidae and Simuliidae. A single factor could not be found for the cause in the change in macroinvertebrate communities from 1998 to 2011 with the data studied, but is likely due to the invasion of zebra mussels in the Muskegon River as well as environmental changes in both Bigelow Creek and Muskegon River...|$|E

In this thesis, the decomposition rate of a standard material (cellulose) is assessed for three types of wetlands, which differ in water regime. The study took place at two localitites of marginal wetlands with standing water (Mokré louky near Třeboň, Záblatské louky), two floodplain localities (Brouskův mlýn and Hamerské louky) and two peatbog localities (intact and mined parts of Červené blato, respectively). The intensity of decomposition processes was compared among the sites using the method of cellulose bags. The bags were made from nylon nets, each was divided into five pockets and a cellulose strip was inserted in each pocket. A filter paper was used as the cellulose. These bags were placed vertically into the soil profile so that the <b>upper</b> <b>sample</b> was lying on the surface and the lowest was at the depth of 25 cm below the surface. At each locality four places were randomly selected and four replicate bags with cellulose were placed on each of them. In total 96 bags were put in place, which makes 480 cellulose samples. Two experiments, differing in length of exposition, were carried out in 2013. The samples were taken from the field sites after three and five weeks of exposure (experiment No. 1 and 2, respectively). In both experiments, the decrease in ash-free dry matter was the highest at Hamerské louky. The lowest decrease in ash-free dry matter was in the mined part of Červené blato peatbog. In the second experiment the decrease of the ashless dry matter was more noticable, which was caused by the prolonged exposure. The lowest decrease of ash-free dry matter was found in depths of 0 - 10 cm below the soil surface at all the sites...|$|E
30|$|Capnograms {{recorded}} at the subglottic {{area and the}} inlet of the lung model had flat phase 3 waveforms, which demonstrated that the gas delivered by HFNC does not reach and wash out the dead space below the subglottic area. With capnograms {{recorded at}} the upper pharynx and oral cavity, PCO 2 started to decrease before phase 3 ends. An HFNC flow of 10  L/min was able to totally wash out CO 2 {{by the end of}} phase 3 at these <b>upper</b> two <b>sampling</b> ports.|$|R
30|$|The outcrop Th 02 emplaced at {{the foot}} of the third hill begins by an uprush flow {{oriented}} toward the South-East (N 105). The flow turned shortly then to the South (N 171). Sample S 2 e can be interpreted as a backwash flow as it appears to be oriented toward North –West (N 297). This backwash possibility is restrained by the weak tilting (6 °) in reason of its position very close to the limit of the confidence area. This confidence area, comprised between 0 and 5 °, comes up with the difficulty to plug the boxes perfectly horizontally in the sediment during sampling. The flow pushed then to the East for samples S 2 f (N 91) and S 2 j (N 98) before taking a South-East orientation (N 124). The outcrop Th 03 is located at the upper part of a pass oriented ENE-WSW. The lower samples S 3 e and S 3 d can be interpreted as an uprush flow oriented to the ESE. The <b>upper</b> <b>samples</b> S 3 b, S 3 c and S 3 a are completely different and give a global direction to WSW, which correspond to a channelization of the flow towards an empty space located south of the dunes.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Mediterranean margins were {{characterized}} by intense maritime commercial exchanges since Antiquity. We conducted a lead isotope study of coastal sediments from Cala Francese, a Roman archaeological site at Cape Corsica (France) {{with the aim of}} evaluating the environmental contamination of lead over the historical period. The Pb content and isotope composition have been measured on the upper sections of three sedimentary columns. According to a radiocarbon chronological framework, the sampling interval covers the last ~ 3500 to 4000 years. Our results indicate that Pb enrichments in the Cala Francese sediments began during the Roman period and changes in the corresponding Pb isotope signatures are consistent with human perturbations of the local environment since the Roman period. Based on a literature compilation of the potential Pb mining districts, we discuss the sources of the Pb contamination. In addition to recording the signature of global atmospheric pollution in the <b>upper</b> <b>samples,</b> the Cala Francese site records a local contamination due to Roman occupation, as indicated by the occurrence of potsherds. The Miocene Pb mining districts from Cartagena and Mazaron in SE Spain are identified as the most probable sources of the local contamination, and are consistent with the archaeological information of the Roman trade routes...|$|R
