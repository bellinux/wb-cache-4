5000|$|During his {{cross-examination}} {{after the}} war by Vera Atkins from SOE, he began to cry at his interrogator's description {{of the death of}} Noor Inayat Khan at Dachau concentration camp.

6000|$|Bradley {{scratched}} his head. [...] "Neither of <b>us</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> die," [...] he said; [...] "at least {{not at the}} hands of any god.

500|$|While filming was {{underway}} {{for the seventh}} season, {{many members of the}} crew felt that the show had entered into its final season. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz later explained, [...] "There was a pretty strong sentiment inside and outside the show {{that it was time to}} call it a day." [...] Because the show's producers felt that the show was nearing its end, many story arcs were ended in the season. The fourth episode, [...] "Millennium" [...] was written as a way to bring closure to the recently cancelled Carter-created series of the same name. The episode features Lance Henriksen reprising his role as Frank for the last time. The eleventh episode, [...] "Closure", features Mulder discovering what happened to his sister. The idea to close the story arc received mixed reactions from various production and crew members. However, many of the show's producers realized that the time had come to answer one of the show's biggest questions. Paul Rabwin noted that, [...] "It's been seven years.

Paul Rabwin explained that, [...] "we found ourselves starting to get energized again. [...] As we got toward the end of the season, everyone was kind of hopeful." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the Manchester Arena bombing, Hopkins {{wrote that}} [...] "Britain {{is faced with}} some hard {{questions}} the people charged with protecting <b>us</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have to answer sooner or later". [...] Hopkins asserted that the suicide bomber, Salman Abedi, was known to the police, and questioned how he was permitted to re-enter Britain unchallenged after visiting Libya. [...] "Our leaders allow such deeply suspicious characters back into Britain," [...] wrote Hopkins, [...] "and then expect us to swallow their lies {{that we will not}} give in to terror?" [...] Hopkins also tweeted about the need for a [...] "final solution", the Nazis' term for the Holocaust, on the morning following the May 2017 Manchester Arena bombing. Although the tweet was soon deleted and reworded as a [...] "true solution", Hopkins claimed the original was only a typographical error (she had also misspelled Manchester). The motive for the attack, and the background of the suicide bomber, was unknown at the time Hopkins made the comment.|$|E

For that you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> risk the {{happiness}} of your granddaughter, {{to say nothing of}} mine; for you don't suppose that either of <b>us</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> feel comfortable and happy, when the snow is whirling round, and the wind sweeping the moors, to think of you trudging along about the country, while we are sitting snugly here by a warm fire.|$|R
5000|$|Moon's {{lifestyle}} {{eventually became}} {{too much for}} Butler, who phoned up Who manager Bill Curbishley, stating flatly that Moon needed to leave LA immediately. He recalls telling Curbishley [...] "I can't do this anymore and one of <b>us</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> pop our socks and it fucking ain't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> me." [...] They moved back to London and Butler promptly left Moon's services. Moon died in September 1978.|$|R

5000|$|Elias Soriano {{explained}} {{the meaning of}} the song saying [...] "I wrote this song as a gigantic 'Fuck You' to all those that doubted this band's will and perseverance. It's for all the naysayers that tried to lead us into defeat, and the fans that have stood behind us for over ten years. It {{set the tone for the}} whole record. We're here to wage war on the airwaves, and <b>to</b> stop <b>us</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take a fucking miracle." ...|$|R
5000|$|It {{was through}} Prof. Rye that Sec. Melchor and Maj. Almonte {{was able to}} pave way for an {{endorsement}} to Indira Gandhi for a dialogue with Moscow. This was the plan as the Philippines then was considered as the United States' strongest ally in Southeast Asia, and a reliable partner during the Cold War. However, the government of Pres. Marcos saw that the <b>US</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> lose in Vietnam, and thus the need to establish ties with the [...] "enemy." ...|$|R

6000|$|I {{am always}} delighted {{to hear from}} you. Your genial earnestness does me good to think of. And {{every day of my}} life I feel more and more that to be {{thoroughly}} in earnest is everything, and to be anything short of it is nothing. You see what we have been doing to our valiant soldiers.[65] You see what miserable humbugs we are. And because we have got involved in meshes of aristocratic red tape to our unspeakable confusion, loss, and sorrow, the gentlemen who have been so kind as to ruin <b>us</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> give us a day of humiliation and fasting the day after to-morrow. I am sick and sour to think of such things at this age of the world. [...] . I am in the first stage of a new book, which consists in going round and round the idea, as you see a bird in his cage go about and about his sugar before he touches it.|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{just the}} same reason that we have been {{learning}} to use our firearms, father. We do not suppose that the natives, who are all friendly with <b>us,</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> turn treacherous. Still, as there is a bare possibility of such a thing, we have taken some pains in learning to shoot straight. In the same way it would be just as well to have strong shutters put up. We don't at all suppose {{we are going to be}} attacked, but if we are the shutters would be invaluable, and would effectually prevent anything like a night surprise. The expense wouldn't be great, and in the unlikely event of the natives being troublesome in this part of this island we should all sleep much more soundly and comfortably if we knew that there was no fear of our being taken by surprise. Mr. Atherton is sending for a couple of dogs too. I have always thought that it would be jolly to have a dog or two here, and if we do not want them as guards they would be pleasant as companions when one is going about the place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are Mr. Romilly, aren't you?" [...] {{one of them}} asked. [...] "Bob Millet told <b>us</b> you <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on this steamer. You know Bob, don't you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then you {{had better}} join <b>us.</b> We <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> try Stannard's line down the gully. I don't engage to make the woods, but I don't see another plan." ...|$|R

5000|$|After {{all three}} were buried, Price told the group: Well, boys, you've done a good job. You've struck a blow for the white man. Mississippi {{can be proud of}} you. You've let those {{agitating}} outsiders know where this state stands. Go home now and forget it. But before you go, I'm looking each one of you in the eye and telling you this: [...] "The first man who talks is dead! If anybody who knows anything about this ever opens his mouth to any outsider about it, then the rest of <b>us</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> kill him just as dead as we killed those three sonofbitches (sic) tonight.

6000|$|... "Mother," [...] Constance began presently, [...] "Fan {{has made}} up her mind to go back to London when her time <b>is</b> up with <b>us.</b> She <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> look for a situation." ...|$|R
5000|$|With the {{location}} selected, the NCR issued orders {{for all of}} the equipment, including a furnace, stirrers and casting machines. Believing the <b>US</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> enter the war and that machine supplies would dry up, the NCR placed additional orders for machine tools and other supplies, to the order of $600,000 ($ in [...] ). On 27 August, Howe appointed Lt.Col. W. E. Phillips to the board, and he replaced Sweny as GM on 30 November. Sod was turned on 16 September 1940, and the first glass poured on 5 June 1941.|$|R

5000|$|Dave Rogers, Kyle Busch's crew chief, stated, [...] "It {{would have}} been great to keep that many cars a lap down, but it {{would have been}} selfish. Everybody behind us was going to pit.
