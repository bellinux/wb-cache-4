5000|$|The race is 50.5 miles long, {{beginning}} at the Ulster County Fairgrounds. Participants begin by bicycling thirty miles. This {{is followed by a}} total of seven transitions, more than is found in other competitions of this sort: a 4.2 mile run to Lake Awosting, 1.1 mile swim across the lake, a 5.5 mile run to Lake Minnewaska, a 0.5 mile swim along that lake's eastern shore, an 8-mile run to Lake Mohonk, a 0.5 mile swim along the east shore of Mohonk Lake, and a 0.7-mile <b>uphill</b> <b>run</b> to the Skytop Tower on Shawangunk Ridge. [...] The course gains and loses several thousands of feet of altitude and provides a number of stunning views for participants, and the finish line is visible from a number of points along the course.|$|E

These GSMNP case studies provide two clear examples of high-intensity fire behavior.

40|$|EMG median power {{frequency}} of the calf muscles was investigated during an exhausting treadmill exercise. This exercise was an <b>uphill</b> <b>run,</b> the average endurance time was 1. 5 min. Median {{power frequency}} of the calf muscles declined by more than 10 % during this exercise. In addition EMG median power frequency of isometric contractions of the same muscles was measured before and in one minute intervals for 10 min after this run. Immediately after the run isometric median power frequency had declined by less than 5 % for the soleus muscle, more than 10 % for the gastrocnemius medialis and gastrocnemius lateralis muscles. In the 10 min following exercise the isometric median power frequency increased to pre-exercise levels. Maybe the median power frequency shift to lower frequencies during dynamic exercise {{can be interpreted as}} a sign of local muscle fatigue...|$|E
40|$|The {{electromyogram}} (EMG) median power Frequency of {{the calf}} muscles was investigated during an exhausting treadmill exercise and a 20 -min recovery period. The exercise was an <b>uphill</b> <b>run</b> {{at a speed}} of 5 km. h(- 1) and a gradient of 20 %. During exercise there was no decrease of EMG median power frequency. Tn contrast, EMG median power frequency in isometric contractions of the same muscles decreased by 7 % for the soleus muscle and 16 to 18 % for gastrocnemius muscles immediately after the exercise, During the recovery period the isometric median power Frequency of the gastrocnemius muscles increased to pre-exercise levels in about 5 min. The isometric median power frequency of the soleus muscle also increased but had not reached pre-exercise values by 20 min. The observations from this study and from a previous uphill treadmill investigation at a steeper gradient ga-cre evidence that two types of exhaustion can be distinguished during dynamic exercise; exhaustion at lower exercise intensities without a decrease in frequency during exercise and exhaustion at high intensities accompanied by a decline of frequency. The reason for this difference remains unclear...|$|E

50|$|The Charger 770 SE (Special Edition) {{featured}} the E55 option; {{which was the}} 340ci 4bbl V8 engine, many motoring journalists correctly reported {{at the time as}} being imported by Chrysler for an aborted racing touring car homologation exercise. Chrysler Racing Manager John Ellis stated at the time that a ute fitted the 340ci V8 (and the same wheelbase as the R/T Charger) was track tested at the Mallala circuit in South Australia by racing driver Leo Geoghegan (and on local roads by Leo and his brother Ian), but was found to be 2-3 seconds slower around Mallala than the E49 (the heavier V8 at the front caused severe understeer and required earlier braking than the Hemi six). Despite the slower lap times at Mallala, it was expected that the extra power of the 340ci V8 would have worked better on the long straights and <b>uphill</b> <b>runs</b> at Bathurst where there were few heavy braking or tight corners. John Ellis then incorrectly stated that the 340ci engines were not imported for Bathurst and that an R/T 340 Charger was not being considered.|$|R

40|$|Running races on {{mountain}} trails at moderate-high altitude {{with large}} elevation changes throughout {{has become increasingly}} popular. During exercise at altitude, ventilatory demands increase due to the combined effects of exercise and hypoxia. To investigate the relationships between thoraco-abdominal coordination, ventilatory pattern, oxygen saturation (SpO 2), and endurance performance in runners during high-intensity uphill exercise. Fifteen participants (13 males, mean age 42 ± 9 yrs) ran a "Vertical Kilometer," i. e., an <b>uphill</b> <b>run</b> involving a climb of approximately 1000 m with a slope greater than 30 %. The athletes were equipped with a portable respiratory inductive plethysmography system, a finger pulse oximeter and a global positioning unit (GPS). The ventilatory pattern (ventilation (VE), tidal volume (VT), respiratory rate (RR), and VE/VT ratio), thoraco-abdominal coordination, which {{is represented by the}} phase angle (PhA), and SpO 2 were evaluated at rest and during the run. Before and after the run, we assessed respiratory function, respiratory muscle strength and the occurrence of interstitial pulmonary edema by thoracic ultrasound. Two subjects were excluded from the respiratory inductive plethysmography analysis due to motion artifacts. A quadratic relationship between the slope and the PhA was observed (r = 0. 995, p = 0. 036). When the slope increased above 30 %, the PhA increased, indicating a reduction in thoraco-abdominal coordination. The reduced thoraco-abdominal coordination was significantly related to reduced breathing efficiency (i. e., an increased VE/VT ratio; r = 0. 961, p = 0. 038) and SpO 2 (r = - 0. 697, p< 0. 001). Lower SpO 2 values were associated with lower speeds at 20 %≥slope≤ 40 % (r = 0. 335, p< 0. 001 for horizontal and r = 0. 36, p< 0. 001 for vertical). The reduced thoraco-abdominal coordination and consequent reduction in SpO 2 were associated with interstitial pulmonary edema. Reductions in thoraco-abdominal coordination are associated with a less efficient ventilatory pattern and lower SpO 2 during uphill running. This fact could {{have a negative effect on}} performance...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This study {{aimed to}} compare the acute effects of uphill {{repeated}} sprinting "with long recovery" (RS) and uphill intermittent running (IR) training on heart rate (HR) and blood lactate (BL) responses. Methods: Thirteen young male soccer players randomly performed in two separate occasions, on a slope (10 %), an RS and an IR session. RS consisted of three sets of eight maximal uphill 20 -m sprints with long (90 s) recovery between sprints, and 8 min passive rest between sets, whereas IR consisted of 24 repetitions of 22 -m sub-maximal (95 % of maximum speed achieved in an incremental test) <b>uphill</b> <b>runs</b> interspersed by a 15 -s downhill walking recovery, lasting for a total duration of 8 min. Results: The mean HR, expressed {{as the percentage of}} HRMAX, was significantly higher in IR than in RS (86. 1 ± 3. 1 vs. 77. 0 ± 4. 5 %, respectively, p < 0. 05). Conversely, BL measured after 3 min was significantly higher in RS (5. 9 ± 1. 1 mmol L- 1) than in IR (2. 9 ± 1. 2 mmol L- 1, p < 0. 05). Conclusions: The differences found between RS and IR may be attributed to the different work/recovery ratios and speed characteristics. Therefore, uphill IR seems more suitable when the target is to tax the aerobic system, while RS may be more suitable when the focus is on stimulating the speed without increasing the metabolic demand...|$|R
