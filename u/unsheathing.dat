2500|$|The first noted {{support for}} chivalric vocation, or the {{establishment}} of knightly class to ensure the sanctity and legitimacy of Christianity, was written in 930 by Odo, abbot of Cluny, in the Vita of St. Gerald of Aurillac, which argued that the sanctity of Christ and Christian doctrine can be demonstrated through the legitimate <b>unsheathing</b> of the [...] "sword against the enemy". In the 11th century {{the concept of a}} [...] "knight of Christ" [...] (miles Christi) gained currency in France, Spain and Italy. These concepts of [...] "religious chivalry" [...] were further elaborated in the era of the Crusades, with the Crusades themselves often being seen as a chivalrous enterprise. Their ideas of chivalry were also further influenced by Saladin, who was viewed as a chivalrous knight by medieval Christian writers. The military orders of the crusades which developed in this period came to be seen as the earliest flowering of chivalry, although it remains unclear to what extent the notable knights of this period—such as Saladin, Godfrey of Bouillon, William Marshal or Bertrand du Guesclin—actually did set new standards of knightly behaviour, or to what extent they merely behaved according to existing models of conduct which came in retrospect to be interpreted {{along the lines of the}} [...] "chivalry" [...] ideal of the Late Middle Ages. Nevertheless, chivalry and crusades were not the same thing. While the crusading ideology had largely influenced the ethic of chivalry during its formative times, chivalry itself was related to a whole range of martial activities and aristocratic values which had no necessary linkage with crusading.|$|E

60|$|A {{succession}} of loud and shrill screams, bursting suddenly from {{the throat of}} the chained form, seemed to thrust me violently back.

I placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs, and felt satisfied. I reapproached the wall. I replied to the yells of him who clamored.

60|$|The cry of 'Down {{with all}} warrants!' was {{popular in the}} ears of the militia of the inn, and Nanty Ewart was no less so. Fishers, ostlers, seamen, smugglers, began to crowd to the spot. Crackenthorp endeavoured in vain to mediate. The attendants of Redgauntlet began to handle their firearms; but their master shouted to them to forbear, and, <b>unsheathing</b> his sword as quick as lightning, he rushed on Ewart {{in the midst of}} his bravado, and struck his weapon from his hand with such address and force, that it flew three yards from him.

60|$|The Duke of Bouillon entertained {{his guests}} splendidly, though his poor Duchess was absent in the Bastille.

Everybody shouted in unison, waved the sword, flourished the hat, and then drank, sometimes standing, sometimes on their knees. The two little boys, with their tiny swords, were delighted to do the same, though their mothers took care that there should be more water than wine in their great goblets.|$|E

6000|$|Governor Risingh {{heard him}} through trumpet and all, but with {{infinite}} impatience; leaning at times, {{as was his}} usual custom, on the pommel of his sword, and at times twirling a huge steel watch-chain, or snapping his fingers. Van Corlear having finished, he bluntly replied, that Peter Stuyvesant and his summons might go to the d----, whither he hoped to send him and his crew of ragamuffins before supper time. Then <b>unsheathing</b> his brass-hilted sword, and throwing away the scabbard, [...] "'Fore gad," [...] quoth he, [...] "but I will not sheathe thee again until I make a scabbard of the smoke-dried leathern hide of this runagate Dutchman." [...] Then having flung a fierce defiance {{in the teeth of}} his adversary, by the lips of his messenger, the latter was reconducted to the portal, with all the ceremonious civility due to the trumpeter, squire, and ambassador, of so great a commander; and being again unblinded, was courteously dismissed with a tweak of the nose, to assist him in recollecting his message.|$|E

How melancholy is the reflection, that in so short a time we should have made such large strides towards fulfilling the predictions of our transatlantic foes! 'Leave them to themselves, and their government will soon dissolve.' Will not the wise and good strive hard to avert this evil? Or will their supineness suffer ignorance and the arts of self-interested and designing, disaffected and desperate characters, to involve this great country in wretchedness and contempt?

6000|$|At {{the same}} moment, a large deer {{greyhound}} sprung over the hermit's fence. It {{is well known}} to the sportsmen in these wilds, that the appearance and scent of the goat so much resemble those of their usual objects of chase, that the best-broke greyhounds will sometimes fly upon them. The dog in question instantly pulled down and throttled one of the hermit's she-goats, while Hobbie Elliot, who came up, and jumped from his horse for the purpose, was unable to extricate the harmless animal from the fangs of his attendant until it was expiring. The Dwarf eyed, for a few moments, the convulsive starts of his dying favourite, until the poor goat stretched out her limbs with the twitches and shivering fit of the last agony. He then started into an access of frenzy, and <b>unsheathing</b> a long sharp knife, or dagger, which he wore under his coat, {{he was about to}} launch it at the dog, when Hobbie, perceiving his purpose, interposed, and caught hold of his hand, exclaiming, [...] "Let a be the hound, man--let a be the hound!--Na, na, Killbuck maunna be guided that gate, neither." ...|$|E
