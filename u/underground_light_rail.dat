5|$|In the 1990s, the {{formation}} of a regional transit authority (RTA) brought light rail planning to the Seattle region. In 1995, the transit authority proposed a regional light rail system to be built by 2010, including an at-grade or <b>underground</b> <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> line through Roosevelt with a station in the neighborhood. The RTA proposal was rejected by voters in March 1995, citing its $6.7 billion price. A smaller, $3.9 billion plan was approved in November 1996, only funding light rail from the University District to Seattle–Tacoma International Airport; an extension north to Northgate via Roosevelt was deferred until additional funding could be secured.|$|E
25|$|The {{monorail}} {{company announced}} in May 2015 {{that it is}} proposing instead an extension to the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino and an infill station at the Sands Expo & Convention Center. Subsequently, the Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada announced that a new <b>underground</b> <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> system under the Las Vegas Strip, which would connect Downtown Las Vegas with the airport, is in the long-term planning phase.|$|E
25|$|Environmentalism is {{prominent}} {{throughout the}} region, especially {{west of the}} Cascades. Environmentally conscious services such as recycling and public transportation are widespread, most notably in the more populous areas. A 2007 statistical analysis ranked the 50 Greenest Cities in the United States, placing Portland, Oregon first, Eugene, Oregon fifth, and Seattle, Washington eighth. The region {{as a whole is}} also known for its bicycle culture as an alternative form of transportation; Portland is considered by Forbes Traveler to be the second most bicycle-friendly city in the world. Portland is also the hub of American bicycle manufacturing; as a whole it generated over $68 million in revenue in 2007 alone. Seattle, Washington has also garnered a reputation for its contributions to public transportation with the Puget Sound Transit system, including an <b>underground</b> <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> system and a 38.9% worker commute rate as of 2011. Politically, the Pacific Northwest is actively involved in environmental efforts. The international organization Greenpeace was born in Vancouver in 1970 as part of a large public opposition movement in British Columbia to US nuclear weapons testing on Amchitka Island in the Aleutians. Liberal and Conservative Northwesterners, such as former U.S. Senator Slade Gorton (R-WA) and moderate Democrats like former Speaker of the House Tom Foley (D-WA), have been prominent in the development of conservative approaches to environmental protection. Seattle in particular is also home to a large number of publications and institutions concerned with the environment and sustainability, including both Worldchanging and Grist.org, the U.S.'s two largest online green magazines. The Pacific Northwest is also noted for a large number of gardening clubs, with Victoria having an annual flower count in February.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the city}} council has {{included}} a light rail system in its local transport plan since 2000, {{it has not yet}} funded the project; Bristol was offered European Union funding for the system, but the Department for Transport did not provide the required additional funding. The most recent light rail proposal was put forward as part of a consultation produced by the West of England Local Enterprise Partnership in November 2016, outlining potential light rail/tram routes from the city centre to Bristol Airport, the eastern and north west fringes of the city, and a route along the A4 road to Bath. In 2017, a further feasibility study will be undertaken into the possibility of an <b>underground</b> <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> system.|$|E

50|$|Designed by {{the renowned}} {{architectural}} firm McKim, Mead and White, the station contains {{a mixture of}} Art Deco and Neo-Classical features. The interior of the main waiting room has medallions illustrating the history of transportation, from wagons to steamships to cars and airplanes, the eventual doom of the railroad age. The current building was dedicated on March 23, 1935; the first regular train to use it was a New York-Philadelphia express at 10:17 on March 24. The new station was built alongside (northwest of) the old station, which was then demolished and replaced by the southeast half of the present station, completed in 1937.

40|$|In {{recent years}} we have seen Wi-Fi move from a “hotspot ” model to fuller {{coverage}} patterns where connectivity is available everywhere, such as across university and enterprise campuses (recall, for example, the Eduroam service). As {{people have come to}} expect more from Wi-Fi of late, there has been concurrent interest in blanketing underground transit systems with wireless coverage, from Transport for London's involvement with Virgin Wireless to the New York Metropolitan Transport Authority's business relationship with the four US national mobile carriers. But these latter systems are focused on providing service to metropolitan underground platforms, frustratingly disconnecting and reconnecting users on their journey through the transit network. We describe work in progress aimed at truly seamless Internet connectivity for {{the hundreds of thousands of}} daily commuters utilising a densely-populated urban area’s metropolitan <b>underground</b> transport system, <b>light</b> <b>rail,</b> or surface roads. We envision hundreds of London commuters on a single train simultaneously watching YouTube videos, surfing the web, chatting with friends and family over video, and downloading files while moving through an underground transit tunnel in a train or car at 30 - 40 miles per hour...|$|R
