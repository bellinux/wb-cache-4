From the 17 elected in 1999, they retained this number in 2003 and went down one to 16 in 2007.

25|$|Irish level {{crossings}} (crosaire comhréidh in Irish) {{are similar to}} <b>UK</b> <b>level</b> crossings, {{in the fact that}} they have a preliminary amber light before the red lights start flashing and the barriers descend (one example at Wexford does not have an amber light). Crossings are the same on the whole island of Ireland, and are either of the old gated variant, or are automatic. Ireland does have automatic crossings that have full barriers, which are not seen in the UK. The audible alarms are unique to the country.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of public sector revenue payable by Scottish residents and enterprises is {{collected at the}} <b>UK</b> <b>level.</b> Generally {{it is not possible}} to identify separately the proportion of revenue receivable from Scotland. GERS therefore uses a number of different methodologies to apportion revenue to Scotland. Following the implementation of the Scotland Act 2012 and Scotland Act 2016, an increasing amount of revenue is set to be devolved to the Scottish Parliament, whereby direct Scottish measures of these revenues will be available. The first revenues which have been devolved are landfill tax and property transaction taxes, with Scottish revenue collected for these taxes from 2015‑16 onwards.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{differences}} in {{the wording of the}} census forms used in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, data on the Other White group is not available for the UK as a whole, but in England and Wales this was the fastest growing group between the 2001 and 2011 censuses, increasing by 1.1 million (1.8 percentage points). Amongst groups for which comparable data is available for all parts of the <b>UK</b> <b>level,</b> there was considerable growth {{in the size of the}} Other Asian category, which increased from 0.4 to 1.4% of the population between 2001 and 2011. There was also considerable growth in the Mixed category. In 2001, people in this category accounted for 1.2% of the UK population; by 2011, the proportion was 2%.|$|E
25|$|Level {{crossings}} (groesfan reilffordd in Welsh, rèidh-tharsainn in Scottish Gaelic) in the United Kingdom {{started out}} as manually gated crossings opened by a signalman. These were standard all across the network until mechanised barriers started to be introduced. These could be operated by a signalman adjacent to the crossing or were automatic. After the major Hixon rail crash in 1968, the design of level crossings started to change, and all mechanised crossings {{had to have a}} preliminary amber light fitted, which makes <b>UK</b> <b>level</b> crossings one of only a few countries with this design of crossing. More recent advantages in technology have led to more technical automatic crossings, more safer open crossings, and crossings with obstacle detection systems to detect stray people or vehicles on the crossing.|$|E

500|$|Murphy, {{a former}} President of the National Union of Students, {{was first elected}} to the House of Commons as the MP for Eastwood in the 1997 general election. Having spent nine years at {{university}} without graduating, {{he worked for the}} Labour Party before becoming an MP. After serving in junior roles in the post-1997 Labour government, he was appointed as Secretary of State for Scotland in 2008, where he led a Scottish business mission to Shanghai and {{played a key role in}} organising the Scotland leg of Pope Benedict XVI's visit to the United Kingdom. He took charge of Labour's Scottish campaign for the 2010 general election, securing a three per cent swing to Labour in Scotland amid a defeat for the party at <b>UK</b> <b>level.</b> He became Shadow Defence Secretary after the election before moving to the post of Shadow International Development Secretary in 2013. In 2011, he co-chaired the Murphy–Boyack review of the structure of the Scottish Labour Party, and was a prominent figure in the Better Together campaign during the 2014 referendum, touring 100 towns in 100 days to campaign for a [...] "No" [...] vote. Commentators, such as the BBC's Aiden James and The Guardians Severin Carrell, have described Murphy as being from the Blairite right wing of the party. Murphy launched his leadership campaign in Edinburgh on 1 November, and subsequently stepped down from the role of Shadow International Development Secretary in order to concentrate on his campaign. His bid to lead the party was backed by the Community and USDAW trade unions. He was also endorsed by Neil Kinnock, a former leader of the UK Labour Party, who donated an undisclosed sum of money to Murphy's campaign, and by Shadow Scottish Secretary Margaret Curran.|$|E
