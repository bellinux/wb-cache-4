The 2008 elections were particularly important to Serbia's relations with the <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> main challenging party which lost the election, SRS, disintegrated when Tomislav Nikolić split with Vojislav Šešelj over integration into the European Union. When Nikolić split from SRS and began pursuing a pro-European profile (a reversal from SRS's eurosceptic position), he was being advised by American lobbying firm Quinn Gillespie & Associates.|$|E

5|$|The Methodist {{movement}} was growing rapidly in pre-Civil War America, but was beset by disputes about slave-holding {{and the rule}} over the church by bishops, resulting in a formal split into two groups in 1844.

The Yumbo name refers to a smaller snack based sandwich from the 1970s and early 1980s which was a heated ham and cheese sandwich served on a smaller, hamburger roll.

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{was first}} observed near Cape Verde on September16. On September21, the Hurricane Hunters observed a circulation, which indicated a tropical depression had formed {{east of the}} northern Leeward Islands. It moved to the west-northwest, becoming Tropical Storm Helene on September23. The next day Helene became a hurricane, aided by an anticyclone aloft. It moved around a large ridge, bringing its center toward the southeastern <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> <b>As</b> <b>the</b> hurricane approached the Carolinas, the hurricane rapidly intensified as the eye became visible on radar, and Helene reached peak winds of 150mph (240km/h) {{on the morning of}} September27. An approaching trough turned the hurricane to the northeast, and Helene came within 10mi (15km) of the coast of North Carolina. It slowly weakened, {{and at the same time}} its size expanded. On September29, Helene became extratropical as it was moving over Newfoundland. The remnants continued to the northeast, later turning to the southeast and dissipating on October4 just west of Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|Boston born Kenza Tazi was {{the sole}} female athlete {{competing}} for Morocco at the 2014 Winter Olympics.

She chose to represent Morocco over the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Moroccan Ski Association offered to fund her training. Tazi qualified for the Sochi Olympics after competing successfully at a number of qualification events, despite injury problems. Also accompanying the two athletes was a third skier, Sami Lamhamedi, the brother of Adam. However, Sami did not compete in events, and was only there as a potential substitute.

5|$|During the War of 1812, Nicolls {{was posted}} to Spanish Florida {{as part of}} the British attempt to recruit local allies in the fight against the <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> <b>As</b> <b>the</b> war ended and after he {{returned}} to England in 1815, he attracted controversy by advocating for the Creeks and other locals who allied themselves with the British. From 1823 to 1828, he was the commandant of Ascension Island in the South Atlantic, which was followed by a posting from 1829 to 1835, as Superintendent of Fernando Po off the coast of Africa. In 1835, Nicolls retired from the Royal Marines with the rank of a lieutenant colonel. For his service, Nicolls was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath, among other honours, and was promoted to the rank of full general in his retirement.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Navy fell apart, without sufficient personnel to man many of its ships or the money to maintain them—indeed, many of them were sold to foreign nations. This left the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> world's undisputed naval superpower. U.S. naval forces did undergo a decline in absolute terms but relative {{to the rest of the}} world, however, United States dwarfs other nations' naval power as evinced by its 11 aircraft supercarriers and their supporting battle groups. During the 1990s, the United States naval strategy was based on the overall military strategy of the United States which emphasized the ability of the United States to engage in two simultaneous limited wars along separate fronts.|$|E

5|$|The Hawker Siddeley Harrier, {{developed}} in the 1960s, {{was the first of}} the Harrier Jump Jet series of aircraft. It was the first operational close-support and reconnaissance fighter aircraft with vertical/short takeoff and landing (V/STOL) capabilities and the only truly successful V/STOL design of the many that arose in that era. The Harrier was developed directly from the Hawker Siddeley Kestrel prototype aircraft, following the cancellation of a more advanced supersonic aircraft, the Hawker Siddeley P.1154. The British Royal Air Force (RAF) ordered the Harrier GR.1 and GR.3 variants in the late 1960s.

5|$|The {{usage of}} the metric system varies around the world. According to the US Central Intelligence Agency's Factbook (2007), the International System of Units has been adopted as the {{official}} system of weights and measures by all {{nations in the world}} except for Myanmar (Burma), Liberia and the United States, while the NIST has identified the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> only industrialised country where the metric system is not the predominant system of units. However, reports published since 2007 hold this is no longer true of Myanmar or Liberia. An Agence France-Presse report from 2010 stated that Sierra Leone had passed a law to replace the imperial system with the metric system thereby aligning its system of measurement with that used by its Mano River Union (MRU) neighbours Guinea and Liberia. Reports from Myanmar suggest that the country is also planning to adopt the metric system.|$|E
