5|$|Searches for the lode veins on both creeks {{succeeded by}} the 1870s and {{eventually}} led to significant lode mining at the Eva May, <b>Uncle</b> <b>Sam,</b> Grey Eagle, Hattie Ferguson, and Comet mines in the Cataract Creek district and the Bullion, Hope, and Katy mines in the Basin Creek district. By 1880, the settlement at Basin became the local source of supplies for mines and miners.|$|E
5|$|The {{district}} boundary {{was drawn}} to include the highest concentration of historic resources. The street plan dates to 1787 {{and the most recent}} historic building dates to 1940, making those years the period of significance. While some newer buildings are inevitably located within the area, the boundary, where possible, excluded significant mid and late 20th-century buildings like the city hall, low-income housing projects, and the <b>Uncle</b> <b>Sam</b> Atrium, a large shopping mall downtown. All of the original five historic districts are included in full, along with other historic neighborhoods, for a total of 10% of the city's area.|$|E
5|$|Both prank and {{intentionally}} deadly exploding cigars {{have been}} featured in numerous works of fiction, spanning many forms of media including literature, film, comics books, cartoons and others. A well-known use of the exploding cigar in literature, for example, appears in Thomas Pynchon's 1973 novel, Gravity's Rainbow. In it, the character Etzel Ölsch symbolically betrays his death wish by eagerly smoking a cigar he knows {{to be of the}} prank explosive variety. Other book examples include Robert Coover's 1977 novel, The Public Burning, where a fictionalized Richard Nixon hands an exploding cigar to <b>Uncle</b> <b>Sam,</b> and Sherburne James' Death's Clenched Fist (1982), in which a Tammany Hall politico of the 1890s is murdered with an exploding cigar.|$|E

5|$|Saints Row IV was {{released}} for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 in North America on August 20, 2013, and worldwide on three days later. Preorders included a patriot-themed downloadable content pack that included flamethrower, dubstep, and rocket launcher weapons, a bald eagle jet, and an <b>Uncle</b> <b>Sam</b> outfit. A limited edition {{release of the}} game included {{a replica of the}} game's dubstep gun, a doomsday button, and Johnny Gat statuette. Another limited edition release, the Game of the Generation Edition, included the previous items as well as a display case for the game. The game was originally refused ratings classification and effectively banned in Australia, but was later accepted when modified to remove an optional mission that involved an anal probe weapon and incentivized drug use. The country's PlayStation 4 release was later recalled due to a classification error.|$|E
5|$|Two {{other changes}} take in other {{significant}} buildings. Along {{the north side}} of Ferry at the district's east, just north of the Eighth Ward addition, the boundary would be extended east, taking in another set of rowhouses {{on the west side of}} Fifth and the city's former jail and sheriff's office at the northeast corner of Ferry and Fifth. On the north, the <b>Uncle</b> <b>Sam</b> Atrium shopping mall and parking garage complex, occupying most of the block between Broadway and Third, Fourth and Fulton streets would now be included. Built in 1978, it is the only significant example of modern architecture in the district and the last large-scale project built in downtown Troy.|$|E
5|$|Tidd {{imported}} Ch. Bowhit Pivot for his breeding {{lines in}} 1935, registering {{him with the}} AKC as Sierra Bowhit Pivot. In addition to his British titles, {{he became the first}} Corgi to be awarded Champion status in the US, and the first such dog to be named Best of Group at a conformation show in the United States. A month after those achievements, Little Madam repeated his victories. The Pembroke Welsh Corgi club was formed in 1937, and the first show was held at Geraldine Rockefeller Dodge's Gilralda Farms in New Jersey. Following the Second World War, there were imports from the United Kingdom, including Rozavel <b>Uncle</b> <b>Sam</b> which dominated the show circuit for Corgis. In 1949, he became the first Pembroke winner of Best in Show at an open conformation show in the United States. By 1998, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi had become the 37th most popular breed of dog in the United States.|$|E

25|$|This {{version of}} Life took sides in {{politics}} and international affairs, and published fiery pro-American editorials. Mitchell and Gibson were incensed when Germany attacked Belgium; in 1914 they undertook a campaign to push the United States into the war. Mitchell's seven years studying at Paris art schools made him partial to the French; there was no unbiased coverage of the war. Gibson drew the Kaiser as a bloody madman, insulting <b>Uncle</b> <b>Sam,</b> sneering at crippled soldiers, and shooting Red Cross nurses. Mitchell lived {{just long enough to}} see Life crusade result in the U.S. declaration of war in 1917.|$|E
25|$|In {{autumn of}} 1855, a ship bearing {{refugees}} from an ongoing cholera epidemic in the Far East (authorities disagree {{as to whether}} this was the S.S. Sam or the S.S. Carolina but primary documents indicate that the Caroline {{was involved in the}} epidemic of 1850 and the SS <b>Uncle</b> <b>Sam</b> in the epidemic of 1855) docked in San Francisco. As the city's rapid Gold Rush area population growth had significantly outstripped the development of infrastructure, including sanitation, a serious cholera epidemic quickly broke out. The responsibility for caring for the indigent sick had previously rested on the state, but faced with the San Francisco cholera epidemic, the state legislature devolved this responsibility to the counties, setting the precedent for California's system of county hospitals for the poor still in effect today. The Sisters of Mercy were contracted to run San Francisco's first county hospital, the State Marine and County Hospital, due to their efficiency in handling the cholera epidemic of 1855. By 1857, the order opened St. Mary's Hospital on Stockton Street, the first Catholic hospital west of the Rocky Mountains. In 1905, The Sisters of Mercy purchased a lot at Fulton and Stanyan Streets, the current location of St. Mary's Medical Center, the oldest continually operating hospital in San Francisco.|$|E

25|$|On the August 4, 2014 {{episode of}} Raw, {{thanks to a}} {{distraction}} from Dean Ambrose, Slater scored an upset victory over Seth Rollins and he followed it up a week later with a count-out victory over Dolph Ziggler thanks to yet another distraction, this time from The Miz. During this period, Slater Gator also scored victories on Main Event over Los Matadores and Gold and Stardust. Slater's brief winning streak was ended when Slater Gator were defeated by Los Matadores on the August 25, 2014 edition of Raw. Slater Gator then began a feud with Adam Rose and his bunny, who has attacked Slater on many occasions. In his return to Raw on November 17, 2014, he returned in <b>Uncle</b> <b>Sam</b> attire and became the next victim against Rusev. Later at Survivor Series, Slater remained and Titus O'Neil lost to Adam Rose and The Bunny. In December 2014, a warrant for Slater's arrest was issued, rendering him inactive until all legal issues are resolved. The charges were dropped on January 15, 2015. Slater returned to action in a dark match against Luke Harper on February 3, 2015. On the February 12, 2015 edition of SmackDown, Slater Gator competed in a tag team turmoil match, where they were quickly defeated by the team of Daniel Bryan and Roman Reigns.|$|E
