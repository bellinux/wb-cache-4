Since {{only a small}} part of them has been renovated by now, the energy performance of this {{building stock}} is on average quite poor, resulting in a significant impact on the energy balance of European countries, as confirmed by data published by ISTAT (Italian National Statistical Institute). However, energy retrofit in historic edifices is a quite demanding issue as any intervention must take into account the need to preserve existing building materials and appearances while also allowing reversibility and low invasiveness. As an example, in these buildings it is not possible to apply an ETICS (External Thermal Insulation Composite System), since this would alter the historic and architectural value of the façade.

40|$|The EU Waste Framework Directive, which Norway {{through the}} EEA-agreement {{is obliged to}} follow, {{requires}} that by 2020 a minimum of 70 % (by weight) of non-hazardous construction and demolition waste (CDW) shall be prepared for re-use, recycled or undergo other material recovery (including backfilling operations, using waste to substitute other materials). To evaluate where Norway is in relation to this requirement in 2020 and up till 2100, the focus in this thesis has been to perform a stock dynamic modeling of the future building related CDW in Norway. The dynamics in the system (the building stock) are of major importance when performing such projection. There are flows of materials into the building stock due to construction and renovation activities, and there are corresponding outflows due to construction, renovation and demolition activities. The inflows to the construction phase are driven by the demand for <b>useful</b> <b>floor</b> <b>area</b> per capita (UFApC) in the residential and non-residential building stock and the materials needed to fulfill this demand. The renovation rate is driving the inflow of material to the use phase (renovation activity) and the corresponding outflow of waste. The lifetime of the buildings drives the outflows from the systems, which again affects the inflow since there is a given demand for <b>useful</b> <b>floor</b> <b>area</b> {{that has to be}} fulfilled at each time. Waste from the demolition phase will be estimated {{on the basis of the}} building stock that has reached the end of its lifetime and the materials in that part of the building stock. Since waste is also generated during the construction and renovation phase, waste generation factors for these activities are used. The results in the modeling are possible scenarios of the development of building related CDW until 2100. It showed increased waste amounts in the future, as much as 250 % higher in 2100 than in 2013. The demolition waste will constitute a larger share of the total building related CDW than today due to aging building stock. Brick and Concrete (B&C) will be an even more dominating fraction in the future than today. By using the current recycling rates it will, because of the increase in B&C, be possible (according to the model) to reach the EU Waste Framework Directive already in 2020. The total material recovery will increase as the years go by due to the larger share of demolition waste. However, the modeling shows somewhat higher amounts of B&C than in the statistical information. It will therefore be important to increase the material recovery rates as much possible for all fractions. It will be especially important to increase the rate for B&C since it is the dominating fraction and the authorities should promote this. The requirement of waste sorted out should also be increased, so as to reduce the mixed waste, which probably will be higher in reality than in the model. </p...|$|E

Data from Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) and ecoinvent is used. The NORDEL electricity mix is used for Norwegian production and electricity consumption. SimaPro 8. 0 is used to process the data, and the ReCiPe method, hierarchist midpoint version 1. 06 {{is used for the}} impact assessment. The largest environmental impacts from the production of building materials is from concrete, insulation, and cladding. Com- paring the LCA results of the passive house school to the same school built to standard reveals a 16 % reduction in climate change impacts. The environmental impacts associated with the use phase are lower for the passive school relative to the standard school. The total life cycle climate change impacts per m 2 <b>useful</b> <b>floor</b> <b>area</b> is 1. 2 tons CO 2 eq for the passive school and 1. 46 tons CO 2 eq for the TEK 10 school. The delivered energy for electricity and heating for the passive school was estimated to be 44 kWh/m 2, and the cumulative energy consumption for the passive house is 27 GJ eq per m 2, and is 9 % lower than the energy demand of the TEK 10 school over the same lifetime. Share of impacts from construction, waste, and maintenance were significant including 32 % of climate change emissions, 55 % of terrestrial acidification and 46 % of particulate matter formation.

Both Germany and the UK have published their legislation to implement this requirement. This paper compares and contrasts the approaches in each country. It covers: • the methodology; • the content of the energy certificates to be displayed by public buildings; • the Advisory Report (giving the recommended energy improvement measures); • the training and accreditation requirements for assessors. Except in Scotland, the UK is using two complementary procedures for quantifying the energy efficiency of a non-residential building: 1. Energy performance certificates (EPCs) which reflect the intrinsic efficiency of a building assuming standard use (the Asset Rating). EPCs are the responsibility of the owner, are based on calculation for heating, hot water, cooling, ventilation and lighting only, and will be required when a building is constructed, sold or let, i. e. {{as a part of a}} property transaction. 2. Display Energy Certificates (DECs) which are based on the actual total amount of energy used by a building over a year (the Measured or ‘Operational ’ Rating), and compared with an appropriate benchmark. DECs are required to fulfil EPBD Article 7. 3 and must be displayed prominently by all ‘Public Buildings ’ over 1, 000 m 2 from 1 st October 2008.

40|$|The {{shape factor}} of a {{building}} expresses the ratio between the building’s thermal envelope area and its volume, or alternatively to its <b>useful</b> <b>floor</b> <b>area.</b> Buildings with lower shape factors will have lower heat losses through the thermal envelope and lower specific final energy demand. The shape factor of building could be reduced by a compact building shape design, and by increasing {{the volume of the}} building. However, the requirement for indoor natural light put a limit {{on the size of the}} building and therefore may limit the value of the shape factor. One possible solution to address this aspect is designing building with a heated atrium. An atrium is a large enclosed space within a building, and may have a glazed roof. In a multi-story apartment building an atrium has the potential to increase the social interaction between the residents and, with the right design, at the same time reduce the heating demand of the building due to lower building shape factor. However, the use of atrium in residential buildings in Nordic countries has not yet gained popularity. In this paper the impact of the heated atrium building with cylindrical shape design on the specific final energy is investigated by comparing such building design to conventional design buildings with similar floor area. The Nydalahuset project, in city Umeå in the north of Sweden, which is a multi-story residential building with a heated atrium, is used as a case study to investigate the affect of the atrium on the social interaction among the building occupants. The results show that heated atrium building with cylindrical shape design is a better energy efficient design than the conventional buildings. Such buildings in cold climate could help to reduce the heat losses through the thermal envelope and facilitate to achieve the passive house criteria. Moreover, the Nydalahuset project suggests that the atrium design could improve the social interaction of occupants in residential buildings. HU...|$|E
40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{problems}} that accompany reconstruction of multifunctional medical facilities (MMF). This subject is highly relevant in Russia, as {{the majority of these}} institutions need modernization and refurbishment. There is a need to develop an optimal algorithm of reconstruction design development and to identify the factors that affect the formation of space-planning solutions associated with the reconstruction. The first step of the algorithm may be the analysis of the current condition of the facility, or the medical technological survey (MTS). Its objective is to obtain the data concerning the structure of the facility: its realistic unit structure, its occupied work areas, specialization of its units, exact names and location of all rooms, regular staffing. The second step is the formation of medical technological objectives (MTO). At this step, the post-reconstruction structure of the medical facility may be determined, including the identification of the main functional zones, qualitative and quantitative characteristics and types of basic technological and engineering items of equipment to be installed there. An integral part of the MTO is the programme of <b>useful</b> <b>floor</b> <b>area</b> of the MMF. This document is to enlist all premises of the facility, including their normative dimensions. This programme may be used to find out the preliminary total area of the construction facility. The next step is formation of space-planning solutions.

40|$|The European Union {{is giving}} {{more and more}} {{emphasis}} to its energy policies, whose strategy and actions {{are included in the}} Energy Union Package and the 2030 Framework for Climate and Energy. Buildings in which people live and work are responsible for an important portion of the energy consumption in Europe (approximately 40 % of the primary energy consumption) and there are several policies and initiatives that are aiming at improving their energy performance. In particular, the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (Directive 2010 / 31 /EU) contains requirements about systems of certification of the energy performance of buildings to be adopted by Member States. For example, energy performance certificates have to include the energy performance of a building and reference values such as minimum energy performance requirements {{in order to make it}} possible for owners or tenants of buildings to compare and assess their energy performance. Certificates have to be issued also for buildings where a total <b>useful</b> <b>floor</b> <b>area</b> over a certain threshold is occupied by a public authority and frequently visited by the public. Moreover, these certificates contain location data related to energy consumption and energy efficiency, which are at the same time semantically rich and spatially detailed (at building level). Therefore, they contribute to improve considerably the data accuracy at local level, which is explicitly required by the energy efficiency policy instruments, aiming to overcome the current limitations of using top-down statistical approaches for energy efficiency assessments at local level. In the policy context described above, the current lack of harmonisation of energy performance certificates at European level represents a barrier for different groups of stakeholders engaged in the energy policies lifecycle. This report contains the results achieved by a pilot project, in which a methodology for the harmonisation of energy performance certificates was designed, developed and tested with a regional authority managing a certificates’ register. Applying the same methodology to certificates’ registers managed by other national/regional authorities will contribute to achieve the harmonisation of the certificates at European level. The methodology is based on the INSPIRE Directive 2007 / 2 /EC, establishing an infrastructure for spatial information in Europe to support Community environmental policies, and policies or activities which may have an impact on the environment, such as energy policies. In particular, the methodology used to extend the INSPIRE data models in thematic areas such as energy efficiency of buildings, can be re-used in other domains benefitting from data harmonisation according to common data models adopted at European level.

In case students are provided with a cubicle, then each student must be provided with a window and a <b>floor</b> <b>area</b> of 5.0 m² at the least. A bedroom for a single student should be at least of <b>floor</b> <b>area</b> of 6.0 m².

50|$|A {{sunspace}} with a masonry thermal wall {{will need}} approximately 0.3 ft2 of thermal mass wall surface per ft2 of <b>floor</b> <b>area</b> being heated (0.3 m2 per m2 of <b>floor</b> <b>area),</b> depending on climate. Wall thicknesses should {{be similar to}} a thermal storage wall. If a water wall is used between the sunspace and living space, about 0.20 ft2 of thermal mass wall surface per ft2 of <b>floor</b> <b>area</b> being heated (0.2 m2 per m2 of <b>floor</b> <b>area)</b> is appropriate. In most climates, a ventilation system is required in summer months to prevent overheating. Generally, vast overhead (horizontal) and east- and west-facing glass areas {{should not be used}} in a sunspace without special precautions for summer overheating such as using heat-reflecting glass and providing summer-shading systems areas.|$|R
