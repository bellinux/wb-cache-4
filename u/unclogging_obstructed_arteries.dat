50|$|Percutaneous {{coronary}} intervention (PCI) is a non-surgical procedure used {{to treat}} narrowing (stenosis) of the coronary arteries of the heart found in coronary artery disease. After accessing the blood stream through the femoral or radial artery, the procedure uses coronary catheterization to visualise the blood vessels on X-ray imaging. After this, an interventional cardiologist can perform a coronary angioplasty, using a balloon catheter in which a deflated balloon is advanced into the <b>obstructed</b> <b>artery</b> and inflated to relieve the narrowing; certain devices such as stents can be deployed to keep the blood vessel open. Various other procedures can also be performed.|$|R
50|$|Angioplasty, {{also known}} as balloon {{angioplasty}} and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), is a minimally invasive, endovascular procedure to widen narrowed or <b>obstructed</b> <b>arteries</b> or veins, typically to treat arterial atherosclerosis.

40|$|Coronary {{arteries and}} their {{branches}} supply blood to myocardium. The obstruction of coronary arteries results in significant loss of myocardium, called acute myocardial infarction, {{and the number}} one cause of death globally. Hence, quantification of the regional amount of heart muscle subtended by <b>obstructed</b> coronary <b>arteries</b> is of critical value in clinical medicine. However, the conventional methods are inaccurate and frequently disagree with clinical practices. This study proposes a novel algorithm to segment regional myocardium-at-risk subtended by any potentially <b>obstructed</b> coronary <b>artery.</b> Assuming the geometric triangular mesh models of coronary artery and myocardium derived from an individual cardiac computed tomography image, the proposed algorithm performs (i) computation of the medial axis of the coronary artery and (ii) segmentation of the coronary artery and myocardium using the medial axis. The algorithm provides the fused segmentation of coronary artery and myocardium via the medial axis. The computed result provides a robust mathematical linkage between myocardium-at-risk and supplying coronary arteries so that ischemic myocardial regions can be accurately identified, and both the extent and severity of myocardial ischemia can be quantified effectively and efficiently. Furthermore, the correspondence between segmented coronary artery and myocardium can be more importantly used for building optimization models of cardiac systems for various applications. We believe that the proposed algorithm and implemented VoroHeart program, which is freely available at [URL] will be an invaluable tool for patient-specific risk predictions and the treatment of <b>obstructed</b> coronary <b>artery</b> disease in clinical medicine.

40|$|SUMMARY We {{extended}} the quantitative seven-pinhole method {{to follow the}} dynamics of thallium redistri-bution after exercise. We observed a pattern of slow late thallium clearance {{that appears to be}} characteristic of myocardium supplied by <b>obstructed</b> coronary <b>arteries.</b> In 28 subjects, quantitative thallium scintigrams (seven-pinhole tomography, circumferential count profiles) and blood samples for thallium concentration were taken immediately, 2 hours and 4 hours after maximal treadmill exercise. Twenty subjects had coronary artery dis-ease (CAD) and eight were normal. The rate of thallium clearance from the blood (TCB) was compared with the rate of thallium clearance from each segmental region of myocardium (TCM, derived by ratioing cor-responding segments of the absolute circumferential count profiles) between the 2 - and 4 -hour images. In seven of the eight normal subjects, TCM exceeded TCB in all regions of all images (specificity 88 %). Seventeen of the 20 CAD patients had at least one region where TCM was less than TCB (sensitivity 85 %). Of the 13 patients with multivessel CAD, 11 had multiple regions with TCM < TCB. Using this criterion, we detected 31 of 39 <b>obstructed</b> coronary <b>arteries.</b> Of the 37 regions that were abnormal by this analysis, 30 corresponded to <b>obstructed</b> coronary <b>arteries.</b> In contrast, while conventional circumferential count profile analysis also was abnormal in 17 of the 20 CAD patients, it diagnosed multivessel CAD in only five of the 13 patients that had it.

40|$|Abstract. Currently, a {{minimally}} invasive surgery called stenting is extensively used to increase the lumen of partially <b>obstructed</b> <b>arteries.</b> Unfortunately, restenosis, a postoperative phenomenon in which the lumen of the artery is reduced due to a traumatism of the artery, is still a concern. The most popular solution that has been adopted by stent manufacturers comprises drug-eluting stents. This paper presents a new stent concept in which the treatment of restenosis is carried out from a completely different angle. Indeed, instead of traumatizing the artery, {{and then trying to}} control restenosis with drugs, the new stent minimizes the traumatism of the artery by expanding itself, not instantaneously, but progressively, and in a controlled manner. To achieve this, a nitinol stent over which a series of polymer rings are installed tries to reach a fully deployed configuration, but the polymer rings, which act as a retainer, become soft over time due to creeping. Thus, after the initial deployment in the artery, the stent continues its expansion autonomously {{over an extended period of}} time (a few weeks). It is believed that the artery has enough time to adapt to the expansion, leading to minimum traumatism. This paper presents the stent design...|$|R

Vascular grafts are required in {{a plethora of}} vascular surgical procedures for obstructed native vessels or dialysis purposes. As many as 1, 500, 000 angioplasties are performed annually in the USA, along with 500, 000 coronary artery bypass procedures and 150, 000 carotid endarterectomies, and 300, 000 patients are receiving dialysis.

This {{does not include the}} millions of procedures for implantation of interposition grafts to replace <b>obstructed</b> <b>arteries</b> in peripheral vascular disease. Almost invariably (except for the latter), surgeons use autologous grafts to carry out these procedures. Saphenous veins, internal thoracic arteries, epigastric arteries, homografts, and radial arteries are being sacrificed to treat the consequences of vascular disease, altogether a major health-related socioeconomic plague. Yet the bodyâs own generosity is not inexhaustible. The availability of grafts, particularly in procedures that involve multiple utilizations, such as coronary artery bypass, is limited and also associated with significant surgical trauma and infection rates.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} whether an abnormal response of {{diastolic blood pressure}} during treadmill exercise stress testing correlated {{with the number of}} obstructed vessels and with left ventricular systolic function in patients with coronary artery disease. DESIGN [...] Diastolic blood pressure was measured invasively during exercise stress testing and coronary angiograms and left ventriculograms were obtained at rest in patients with coronary artery disease. The abnormal (> or = 15 mm Hg) diastolic blood pressure response was compared with the number of <b>obstructed</b> coronary <b>arteries</b> and with left ventricular systolic function. SETTING [...] Two tertiary referral centres. PATIENTS [...] 50 consecutive patients (mean age 57 years) with coronary artery disease. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] The increase in diastolic blood pressure during exercise and its correlation with the appearance and disappearance of ST segment deviation, resting left ventricular systolic function, and the number of <b>obstructed</b> coronary <b>arteries.</b> RESULTS [...] Group 1 : 10 (20 %) patients (three with one, four with two, and three with three vessel coronary artery disease) (mean (SD) age 54. 7 (12) years) had an abnormal diastolic blood pressure response that appeared 1. 2 (0. 3) min before ST segment deviation and became normal 0. 9 (0. 3) min after the ST segment returned to normal. Group 2 : 40 (80 %) patients (12 with one, 16 with two, and 12 with three vessel coronary arteries disease) (aged 56. 8 (8. 2) years) had a normal diastolic blood pressure response to stress testing. The ejection fraction (46. 3 (5) %) and cardiac index (2. 6 (0. 1) 1 /min/m 2) in group 1 were less than in group 2 (61. 6 (4. 2) % and 3. 8 (0. 3) 1 /min/m 2 respectively, p < or = 0. 001).

40|$|Introduction: Residual {{pulmonary}} artery (PA) anomalies {{are a major}} concern after surgery for cono-truncal malformations. This study sought to assess residual PA anomalies using MRI/MRA. Methods: 43 MRI/MRA studies were performed in 37 patients after corrective surgery for cono-truncal malformations. MRI/MRA studies comprised spin-echo, cine, velocity-encoded and 3 D Gadolinium-enhanced MRA sequences. Residual PA anomalies were searched in ail patients; angiographie data were available in 13 patients and a comparison with MRI/MRA was made. Results: 32 / 37 patients had postoperative anomalies of the pulmonary arterial tree. Left {{pulmonary artery}} stenosis {{was the most common}} finding (14 / 32), followed by stenosis at multiple sites (11 / 32). Isolated right pulmonary artery stenosis was rare (2 / 32). The median time interval between MRI/MRA and angiography in the 13 patients undergoing both types of studies was 54 days. The findings between the two examinations were identical regarding stenoses and collateral vessels. In 4 patients, the MRI/MRA study allowed to plan interventional catheterization with balloon dilatation and/or stenting of the <b>obstructed</b> <b>arteries</b> or co il-occlusion of systemic collaterals.

Left ventricular wall motion, NH 3 and FDG uptake were scored using a 16 segment model. Of 490 interpretable segments, 321 (66 %) were abnormal at rest. At low dose 85 (27 %) segments augmented of which 80 (94 %) were viable by PET. In 15 patients, an additional 32 (10 %) abnormal segments augmented at high dose.
