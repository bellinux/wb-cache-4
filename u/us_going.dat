5|$|I don't see {{the point}} of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be {{impossible}} for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to do that, and quite frankly I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music. We're not afraid to experiment, or to be caught with our pants down, so to speak. That's what keeps <b>us</b> <b>going.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1984, {{a tribute}} album titled Every Man Has a Woman was released, {{featuring}} {{a selection of}} Ono songs performed by artists such as Elvis Costello, Roberta Flack, Eddie Money, Rosanne Cash, and Harry Nilsson. It was one of Lennon's projects that he never got to finish. Later that year, Ono and Lennon's final album, Milk and Honey, was released as an unfinished demo. It peaked at No. 3 in the UK and No. 11 in the <b>U.S.,</b> <b>going</b> gold in both countries {{as well as in}} Canada.|$|E

She spent much of that summer in an eventually unsuccessful attempt to persuade the Palestinian National Authority not to attempt to gain membership in the United Nations at its September 2011 General Assembly meeting.|$|E

[...] The rhyme {{is well known}} in Germany with the first line [...] "Ringel, Ringel, Reihe" [...] (as the popular collection Des Knaben Wunderhorn gave it); it has many local variants, often with [...] "Husch, husch, husch" [...] (which in German could mean [...] "quick, quick") in the fourth line, comparable to the [...] "Hush! hush! hush! hush!" [...] of the first printed English version. This popular variant is notable: ...|$|E
500|$|Consequently, {{there was}} a demand for bootleg {{recordings}} of the band. The most notorious of these was an LP entitled H Bomb, recorded at Aachen on 11 July 1970, {{which led to a}} subsequent court case when Virgin Records' Richard Branson was prosecuted for selling it. An article in Melody Maker that examined the bootleg phenomenon claimed that H Bomb was the best selling one at that time. This success, along with albums from other artists such as the Who's Live at Leeds and the Rolling Stones' Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out convinced the band that an official live album would be commercially successful. [...] At the time, Glover told Sounds magazine that [...] "there are so many bootlegs of <b>us</b> <b>going</b> around, if we put out our own live set, it should kill their market." ...|$|E
500|$|Three {{months after}} Chilton's death, Hummel {{died of cancer}} on July 19, 2010. Asked about the band's plans {{after the death of}} Chilton and Hummel, Stephens told Billboard, [...] "It's music we all really love to play, and we love to play it together, so we're trying {{to figure out a way}} forward where we can keep doing it." [...] In a Rolling Stone interview, Stephens said that the May 2010 tribute {{performance}} would be the group's final show as Big Star, although not his last show with Auer and Stringfellow, stating, [...] "I can't see <b>us</b> <b>going</b> out as Big Star... But I would hate to compound the loss of Alex by saying,'That's it' for Ken and Jon, too. I can't imagine not playing with them. There's so much fun—but an emotional bond there too." ...|$|E

500|$|Some {{similarities}} {{exist between}} the character of W.P. Mayhew and novelist William Faulkner. Like Mayhew, Faulkner became known as a preeminent writer of Southern literature and later worked in the movie business. Like Faulkner, Mayhew is a heavy drinker and speaks contemptuously about Hollywood. Faulkner's name appeared in the Hollywood 1940s history book City of Nets, which the Coens read while creating Barton Fink. Ethan explained in 1998: [...] "I read this story in passing that Faulkner was assigned to write a wrestling picture.... That {{was part of what}} got <b>us</b> <b>going</b> on the whole Barton Fink thing." [...] Faulkner worked on a wrestling film called Flesh (1932), which starred Wallace Beery, the actor for whom Barton is writing. The focus on wrestling was fortuitous for the Coens, as they participated in the sport in high school.|$|E
500|$|The idea of reuniting with Nolan and Cooper {{was first}} {{proposed}} in January 2010, when Mark O'Connell suggested Lazzara talk with Nolan on the phone. Lazzara said: [...] "One day he [...] {{called me and}} was like, 'Hey, man, {{what do you think}} about <b>us</b> <b>going</b> back to our original lineup?' And I was like, 'Are you crazy? I haven't talked to John [...] in, like, seven years. I don't know if he'd want to do it.'" [...] O'Connell continued to insist on the idea, [...] "and then I got a call from John ... it felt like no time had passed ... like we had just talked a few days ago". The pair did not discuss creating music initially, instead [...] " [...] reacquainted with what had been going on in our lives. Because for me, I genuinely missed his friendship, and same with Shaun [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|The band started {{recording}} the album in London {{a week after}} the September 11 attacks in the United States, during which their [...] "poignant songs ... garnered larger audiences". Coldplay had never stayed in London for an extended period before and were bombarded by problems focusing on the production process. They decided to relocate to Liverpool, where they had recorded some of the songs on Parachutes. Lead singer Chris Martin said that once there they [...] "became obsessed with recording". [...] "In My Place" [...] was the first song recorded for the album and the one that the band released as the album's lead single [...] "because it was the song that made us want to do a second album. It kept <b>us</b> <b>going</b> and made us think we could still write songs", following [...] "a strange period of not really knowing what we were doing" [...] three months after the success of Parachutes.|$|E

500|$|Slay Tracks was {{recorded}} during a four-hour session on January 17, 1989, at Young's studio. Kannberg, describing {{the studio and}} the recording process, said, [...] "You go into his house and it's stuff everywhere, old dogs lying around, big pot plants everywhere, and Gary tells us that he got all his equipment by selling pot! It was <b>us</b> <b>going</b> in and pretty much just laying down the songs with a glide guitar and a detuned guitar through a bass amp and then we'd play drums over the top." [...] Young, though bewildered by the band's sound, contributed by playing drums. He recalled, [...] " [...] {{come in and they}} play this weird guitar noise and it just sounds like noise, with no background. My drums were in there so I said, 'Should I drum?' and they said 'Okay.'" [...] Kannberg said, [...] "We did it really fast. We probably spent one day tracking and one day mixing it." [...] The title of the EP had been decided prior to its recording, and the pseudonyms S.M. and Spiral Stairs were used to credit Malkmus and Kannberg respectively.|$|E
500|$|Jeff Bhasker, {{one of the}} song's producers, {{explained}} the track's roots as it [...] "came {{in the middle of}} the process of putting together the album". He further elaborated; [...] "We were just having a jam session, tracking some things, and Bruno started playing this groove and making up something on the spot; we all thought it was pretty good. We wound up working a long time on that, trying to get it just right." [...] "Locked Out of Heaven" [...] began as a [...] "cha-cha-style duet, à la Santana's [...] "Smooth"." [...] Ronson asked the Dap-Kings to collaborate on the track in order to get a [...] "crisply syncopated, locked-in groove." [...] Regarding the song, Mars says [...] "Man, there's a good pocket on this song right now. Let's keep it going." [...] He also mentioned that it took a long time to create it, commenting [...] "People didn't see <b>us</b> <b>going</b> at each other's throats in the studio and pulling out our hair." [...] He added, [...] "Trying to get these drums right and figure out a bass line." [...] Lawrence believes the lack of [...] "heavy hitting drums" [...] and the presence of a small guitar solo allows the song to be carried by Mars.|$|E
500|$|MTV {{columnist}} Josh Wigler positively noted [...] "Mysteries of {{the week}} are always compelling when they have interplay with the overarching mythology of Fringe, which was exactly the case in tonight's installment." [...] He also liked the [...] "interesting dynamic" [...] between the still-clueless Peter and the Fringe team about his unknown past. Ramsey Isler from IGN rated the episode 7.8/10; he compared it to [...] "Peter", believing that this week's episode's had [...] "a tough act to follow... this story definitely isn't as good, but it did keep <b>us</b> <b>going</b> along an interesting path to more answers." [...] The IGN writer praised Walter going back to his old jokes {{while at the same}} time possessing [...] "an undercurrent of fear and shame in his personality as he deals with Olivia's knowledge of Peter's secret", but disliked the first half's [...] "slow, procedural" [...] elements as well as the cancer make-up. Despite these small critiques, Isler [...] "liked most of this installment", expressing delight that there were a rare two mythology episodes in a row and that there were subtle references to previous episodes such as Nick Lane in [...] "Bad Dreams". Some reviewers liked the episode title but were disappointed that more elements from the boardgame had not been incorporated into the episode.|$|E

The song debuted on the Dance Club Songs chart dated September 8, 2001, at number 50. It spent a total of 8 weeks on the chart, peaking at number 34. It remained Esthero's highest-peaking song on the chart until [...] "O.G. Bitch" [...] topped the chart three years later.|$|E

We have to rescue the situation." [...] Van der Pol admitted that Raven's schedule at the time was booked solid for a year and the possibility of the film seemed unlikely. [...] "But no, It's not ever happening. If I hear something, I {{will be the first to}} sign on." [...] She also commented on reprising her role of Chelsea Daniels.|$|E

[...] With the {{agreement}} of Stark and the rest of the band, the Replacements signed with Twin/Tone Records in 1980. Jesperson's support of the band was welcomed, and they asked him to be their manager after their second show. Later that summer they played at the Longhorn on a Wednesday [...] "New Band Night". They also played several club gigs to almost empty rooms. When they finished a song, apart from the low hum of conversation, the band would hear Jesperson's loud whistle and fast clapping. [...] "His enthusiasm kept <b>us</b> <b>going</b> at times, definitely," [...] Mars later said. [...] "His vision, his faith in the band was a binding force." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The issue {{revolved}} around Queen refusing {{to go on}} at their allotted time because the light wasn't right - I remember it was sundown, so whoever went on stage wouldn't get the full benefit of their light show. It came down to a battle between management, which then spilled into a fracas between the roadies of our respective bands, as each crew jostled to set gear up. The MC (or some other promoter) goaded the crowd into an us and them vibe, with the local band in favour over the unknown [...] "pommie bastards". It ended with <b>us</b> <b>going</b> on stage first, and Queen redeeming themselves to the crowd and showing a hint {{of what they were}} to become. And that is how I remember it".- Kerry McKenna, bass guitarist for Madder Lake.|$|E

[...] He believed one was the [...] "bandit car" [...] and another may have been a taxi, but Sir Ian and his sergeant were not able to keep up [...] "because we were driving a Hillman Hunter which has a top speed of 25mph minus". The actual top speed of the least powerful Hillman Hunter in 1975 was 83mph and the top speed of a 70s-era taxi was 60mph. According to Purnell: [...] "There was no chase. It was just going along at a normal speed. [...] actually said later they didn't know they were being followed." ...|$|E
