The article commences by modelling the nature of the counter-intuitive thrust to the Coase Theorem, which is used to trace the development of Coase's reasoning, and ultimately to expose the flaw it contains. The heart of the article comprises the allegation of an error made by Coase when he transferred his core argument to the context of economic rents. Ancillary observations are made on the relationship between the Coasean analysis of characteristically legal problems and the conditions of general market equilibrium, and the theoretical status of Law-and-Economics. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to gain some {{understanding}} of the way the European Court of Auditors (ECA) assesses European Union (EU) member states’ performances in managing EU finances. To this end the ECA's annual reports for 1996 – 2001 have been analysed. We find that the information provided in the ECA annual reports is somewhat unsystematic, which is the result of the ECA's approach to auditing and its working methods. A review of the literature, as well as our own empirical analysis, allows us to conclude that the ECA does not in fact live up to its own mission of providing relevant, objective reports. Our analysis suggests, for instance, that there is some ambiguity within the ECA due to differences in audit traditions within the EU. Improvements could be made by reducing the number of ECA members to three or five, by (further) integrating the traditional ECA audit and the audit within the framework <b>of</b> the <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>assurance,</b> and by further integrating internal and external budgetary control within the EU. ...|$|R

After a short presentation of the Court's historical background, there is an examination of this institution's structure. Provisions regarding its Members, Personnel and Internal Organisation are analysed {{in an attempt to}} assess the Court’s structural framework An analysis of the Court's mission, namely to examine all the accounts (revenue/expenditure) of the Communities and of all bodies set up or simply financed by them, is next. The analysis focuses on the audit regarding the regularity/legality of the transactions and the soundness of the financial management. The method used for these audits, called the "systems based approach" is presented and explained. The reporting activities of the Court (Annual Report, <b>Statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>Assurance,</b> Special Reports), being of essential importance since they include the findings of the Court along with the replies of the audited institutions, are given much attention. Because of its competences the Court is {{a major player in the}} battle against fraud in the Communities and its role in that issue is also assessed. The thesis includes also an examination of the Court's auditing competences regarding expenditure for the second and third pillar of the European Union. The collaboration between the Court and the other institutions (Commission, Parliament, Council, European Investment Bank) is presented, focusing on the possibilities of improving it. The dependence of the Court on the assistance of the National Audit Institutions of the Member States, especially regarding on the spot checks is highlighted along with other aspects of their collaboration. The Court's estimations regarding the policies of the European Union (Common Agricultural Policy, Structural Policies, Measures outside the Union) are also included.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} theme of {{ambiguity}} {{in the book of}} Hosea, the means by which this theme is communicated and its effects upon the interpretation of the book as a whole. The contention of this thesis is that the book of Hosea does not allow for 'closed' readings or 'final' interpretations of the book's message and that the book delivers a message which wavers between threats of punishment and promises of reconciliation, yet avoids providing the reader with a final, <b>unqualified</b> <b>statement</b> in favour <b>of</b> one or the other. This tension between threat and promise is one of the qualities which gives the book its tremendous power, {{yet at the same time}} the uncertainty it expresses has been a source of many difficulties for the book's commentators. The first chapter explores the 'marriage metaphor' which has captured the attention of biblical scholarship for many years, examining the uses of words derived from the root זנה, including the varying interpretations of the expression זנןנים שתN. The interpretations of the early chapters of Hosea as 'biography' are critiqued and rejected in favour of viewing the use of such expressions as not only inconsistent with the methods of most proposed biographical reconstructions, but also as a result of the polemical aims and language of the text. The second chapter discusses the literary devices used to create a sense of ambiguity and instability within the book's opening chapters. Special attention is given to the sequence surrounding the naming of the children in the first two chapters and the recurring use of the negative Nל, but a discussion of Hosea's use of imagery with multiple connotations, in particular the 'wilderness' and its role in the wife's abandonment and return, is also included. The third chapter continues the exploration of polyvalent imagery, moving into the latter portion of the book (chapters 4 - 14). The investigation deepens by examining the intertwining of the images of 'Exodus', 'Egypt' and the 'wilderness', the use of the root שרב in conjunction with these images as illustrations of the polyvalent imagery found in the book of Hosea, and the element of physical motion involved in metaphors of apostasy and faithfulness. From this analysis one can more clearly see how the 'marriage metaphor' of Hosea 1 - 3 sets forth the book's basic themes, and also provides the reader with both a means of entry into the dynamic tension of the text, as well as some of the interpretative tools required to analyse a book which consistently defies expectations and evades facile summarisation...|$|R
