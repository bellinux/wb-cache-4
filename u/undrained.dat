25|$|When the LI is 1, remolded soil is at {{the liquid}} limit and it has an <b>undrained</b> shear {{strength}} of about 2 kPa. When the soil {{is at the}} plastic limit, the LI is 0 and the <b>undrained</b> shear strength is about 200 kPa.|$|E
25|$|If {{water is}} not allowed to flow in or out of the soil, the stress path is called an <b>undrained</b> stress path. During <b>undrained</b> shear, if the {{particles}} are surrounded by a nearly incompressible fluid such as water, then the density of the particles cannot change without drainage, but the water pressure and effective stress will change. On the other hand, if the fluids are allowed to freely drain out of the pores, then the pore pressures will remain constant and the test path is called a drained stress path. The soil is free to dilate or contract during shear if the soil is drained. In reality, soil is partially drained, somewhere between the perfectly <b>undrained</b> and drained idealized conditions.|$|E
25|$|Loading conditions: Effective stress path -drained, <b>undrained,</b> {{and type}} of loading -magnitude, rate (static, dynamic), and time history (monotonic, cyclic).|$|E
25|$|As an {{implication}} of <b>undrained</b> condition, no elastic volumetric strains occur, and thus Poisson's ratio {{is assumed to}} remain 0.5 throughout shearing. The Tresca soil model also assumes no plastic volumetric strains occur. This is of significance in more advanced analyses such as in finite element analysis. In these advanced analysis methods, soil models other than Tresca {{may be used to}} model the <b>undrained</b> condition including Mohr-Coulomb and critical state soil models such as the modified Cam-clay model, provided Poisson's ratio is maintained at 0.5.|$|E
25|$|Triaxial shear tests : This {{is a type}} of {{test that}} is used to {{determine}} the shear strength properties of a soil. It can simulate the confining pressure a soil would see deep into the ground. It can also simulate drained and <b>undrained</b> conditions.|$|E
25|$|A salt pan (saltpan) {{is either}} an <b>undrained</b> small shallow natural {{depression}} in which water accumulates and evaporates leaving a salt deposit or the shallow lake of brackish water occupying a salt pan. This term {{is also used}} for a large pan for recovering salt by evaporation.|$|E
25|$|The Quaternary {{glaciation}} {{created more}} lakes {{than all other}} geologic processes combined. The reason is that a continental glacier completely disrupts the preglacial drainage system. The surface over which the glacier moved was scoured and eroded by the ice, leaving a myriad of closed, <b>undrained</b> depressions in the bedrock. These depressions filled with water and became lakes.|$|E
25|$|Liquefaction is {{more likely}} to occur in loose to {{moderately}} saturated granular soils with poor drainage, such as silty sands or sands and gravels capped or containing seams of impermeable sediments. During wave loading, usually cyclic <b>undrained</b> loading, e.g. seismic loading, loose sands tend to decrease in volume, which produces an increase in their pore water pressures and consequently a decrease in shear strength, i.e. reduction in effective stress.|$|E
25|$|DSSM {{provides}} for very close fits to stress–strain curves, including for sands. Because it tracks {{conditions on the}} failure plane, it also provides close fits for the post failure region of sensitive clays and silts something that other theories {{are not able to}} do. Additionally DSSM explains key relationships in soil mechanics that to date have simply been taken for granted, for example, why normalized <b>undrained</b> peak shear strengths vary with the log of the over consolidation ratio and why stress–strain curves normalize with the initial effective confining stress; and why in one-dimensional consolidation the void ratio must vary with the log of the effective vertical stress, why the end-of-primary curve is unique for static load increments, and why the ratio of the creep value Cα to the compression index Cc must be approximately constant {{for a wide range of}} soils..|$|E
25|$|Depending on {{the initial}} void ratio, the soil {{material}} can respond to loading either strain-softening or strain-hardening. Strain-softened soils, e.g. loose sands, can be triggered to collapse, either monotonically or cyclically, if the static shear stress {{is greater than the}} ultimate or steady-state shear strength of the soil. In this case flow liquefaction occurs, where the soil deforms at a low constant residual shear stress. If the soil strain-hardens, e.g. moderately dense to dense sand, flow liquefaction will generally not occur. However, cyclic softening can occur due to cyclic <b>undrained</b> loading, e.g. earthquake loading. Deformation during cyclic loading will depend on the density of the soil, the magnitude and duration of the cyclic loading, and amount of shear stress reversal. If stress reversal occurs, the effective shear stress could reach zero, then cyclic liquefaction can take place. If stress reversal does not occur, zero effective stress is not possible to occur, then cyclic mobility takes place.|$|E
25|$|A {{state of}} 'soil liquefaction' {{occurs when the}} {{effective}} stress of soil is reduced to essentially zero, which corresponds to a complete loss of shear strength. This may be initiated by either monotonic loading (e.g. single sudden occurrence {{of a change in}} stress – examples include an increase in load on an embankment or sudden loss of toe support) or cyclic loading (e.g. repeated change in stress condition – examples include wave loading or earthquake shaking). In both cases a soil in a saturated loose state, and one which may generate significant pore water pressure on a change in load are the most likely to liquefy. This is because a loose soil has the tendency to compress when sheared, generating large excess porewater pressure as load is transferred from the soil skeleton to adjacent pore water during <b>undrained</b> loading. As pore water pressure rises a progressive loss of strength of the soil occurs as effective stress is reduced.|$|E
25|$|Full flow penetrometers (T-bar, ball, and plate) probes {{are used}} in {{extremely}} soft clay soils (such as sea-floor deposits) and are advanced {{in the same manner}} as the CPT. As their names imply, the T-bar is a cylindrical bar attached at right angles to the drill string forming what look likes a T, the ball is a large sphere, and the plate is flat circular plate. In soft clays, soil flows around the probe similar to a viscous fluid. The pressure due to overburden stress and pore water pressure is equal on all sides of the probes (unlike with CPT's), so no correction is necessary, reducing a source of error and increasing accuracy. Especially desired in soft soils due to the very low loads on the measuring sensors. Full flow probes can also be cycled up and down to measure remolded soil resistance. Ultimately the geotechnical professional can use the measured penetration resistance to estimate <b>undrained</b> and remolded shear strengths.|$|E

Little attempt was made during the 17th and 18th centuries to pump water, possibly because the coal-driven Newcomen steam engines would have been uneconomical. It is unclear why windmills were not employed, as they were on the Fens of East Anglia, but only two examples have been recorded on the Levels: one at Bleadon {{at the mouth of the}} River Axe, where a sea wall had been built, and the other at Common Moor north of Glastonbury, which was being drained following a private Act of Parliament in 1721.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Undrained</b> {{strength}} is typically defined by Tresca theory, based on Mohr's circle as: ...|$|E
2500|$|Conceptually, {{there is}} no such thing as the <b>undrained</b> {{strength}} of a soil. It depends on a number of factors, the main ones being: ...|$|E
2500|$|For <b>undrained,</b> {{constant}} volume shearing, the Tresca theory {{may be used}} {{to predict}} the shear strength, but for drained conditions, the Mohr–Coulomb theory may be used.|$|E
2500|$|... and the {{strength}} is very sensitive to the effective stress. It follows then that the <b>undrained</b> shear strength of a soil may be smaller or larger than the drained shear strength depending upon whether the soil is contractive or dilative.|$|E
2500|$|Dilation of the voids causes {{negative}} water {{pressures that}} draw fluid into the pores, and contraction of the voids causes positive pore pressures {{to push the}} water out of the pores. If the rate of shearing is very large compared to the rate that water can be sucked into or squeezed out of the dilating or contracting pore spaces, then the shearing is called <b>undrained</b> shear, if the shearing is slow enough that the water pressures are negligible, the shearing is called drained shear. During <b>undrained</b> shear, the water pressure u changes depending on volume change tendencies. From the effective stress equation, the change in u directly effects the effective stress by the equation: ...|$|E
2500|$|As the {{transitions}} from one state to another are gradual, the tests have adopted arbitrary definitions {{to determine the}} boundaries of the states. The liquid limit is determined by measuring [...] the water content for which a groove closes after 25 blows in a standard test. Alternatively, a fall cone test apparatus may be use to measure the liquid limit. The <b>undrained</b> shear strength of remolded soil at the liquid limit is approximately 2 kPa. The Plastic Limit is the water content below which {{it is not possible to}} roll by hand the soil into 3mm diameter cylinders. [...] The soil cracks or breaks up as it is rolled down to this diameter. Remolded soil at the plastic limit is quite stiff, having an <b>undrained</b> shear strength of the order of about 200 kPa.|$|E
2500|$|The {{steady state}} occurs only after all {{particle}} breakage if any is complete {{and all the}} particles are oriented in a statistically steady state condition and so that the shear stress needed to continue deformation at a constant velocity of deformation does not change. [...] It applies to both the drained and the <b>undrained</b> case.|$|E
2500|$|Three common misconceptions {{regarding}} the steady state are that a) {{it is the}} same as the critical state (it is not), b) that it applies only to the <b>undrained</b> case (it applies to all forms of drainage), and c) that it does not apply to sands (it applies to any granular material). [...] A primer on the Steady State theory can be found in a report by Poulos [...] [...] Its use in earthquake engineering is described in detail in another publication by Poulos [...]|$|E
2500|$|One {{relationship}} {{used extensively}} by practicing engineers is the empirical {{observation that the}} ratio of the <b>undrained</b> shear strength c to the original consolidation stress p' is approximately a constant for a given Over Consolidation Ratio (OCR). This relationship was first formalized by [...] and [...] who also extended it to show that stress-strain characteristics of remolded clays could also be normalized with respect to the [...] original consolidation stress. [...] The constant c/p relationship can also be derived from theory for both critical-state [...] and steady-state soil mechanics [...] [...] This fundamental, normalization property of the stress-strain curves is found in many clays, and was refined into the empirical SHANSEP (stress history and normalized soil engineering properties) method..|$|E
2500|$|Midsummer Place (subsequently rebranded intu Milton Keynes) is {{effectively}} a southwards {{extension of the}} centre but is owned and operated independently. (It was a planning requirement {{that it should not}} physically attach to the original building, so there is an approximately one metre gap between them). Midsummer Place was designed by GMW Architects of London and opened in 2000. This extension is built across (and thus closing) Midsummer Boulevard using a (covered and enclosed) plaza that contains some demountable kiosks: it is a further planning requirement that the Boulevard should technically be capable of being reopened (remain free of structures) at some future date. The new centre was constructed in part around an existing oak tree that briefly survived being built around (at a [...] higher level) until it succumbed to 'technical drowning' (<b>undrained</b> flooding) from about 2008.|$|E

60|$|No {{man ever}} admits the unhealthiness {{of the place}} he dwells in (unless he is going away from it), and I shall therefore, I have no doubt, be at issue with the {{inhabitants}} of St. Louis, in questioning the perfect salubrity of its climate, and in hinting that I think it must rather dispose to fever, {{in the summer and}} autumnal seasons. Just adding, that it is very hot, lies among great rivers, and has vast tracts of <b>undrained</b> swampy land around it, I leave the reader to form his own opinion.|$|E

[...] So the mules were brought out, and he lifted his uncomplaining wife on to the {{blankets}} which formed her pillion. The file again formed itself, and slowly they wound their way out from the small enclosure by which the hut was surrounded;--out from the enclosure on to a rough scrap of <b>undrained</b> pasture ground from which the trees had been cleared. In a few minutes they were once more struggling through the mud.|$|E
60|$|The unpaved street, <b>undrained</b> and unutterably filthy, was ankle-deep in mud, even at {{the close}} of this hot August day. Down one side a long blank wall, stone-built and green with mildew, {{presented}} an unbroken frontage: on the other the row of houses with doors perpetually barred, and windows whereon dust and grit had formed effectual curtains against prying eyes, added to the sense of loneliness, of insecurity, of unknown dangers lurking behind that crippled archway, or beneath the shadows of the projecting eaves, whence the perpetual drip-drip of soot water came as a note of melancholy desolation.|$|E

Between his two conductors, Mr. Snagsby passes along the middle of a villainous street, <b>undrained,</b> unventilated, deep in black mud and corrupt water--though the roads are dry elsewhere--and reeking with such smells and sights that he, who has lived in London all his life, can scarce believe his senses. Branching from this street and its heaps of ruins are other streets and courts so infamous that Mr. Snagsby sickens in body and mind and feels as if he were going every moment deeper down into the infernal gulf.|$|E

60|$|The Britons soon {{discovered}} that the Romans had retreated, but made no movement in pursuit. They knew that the legionaries once in open ground were more than their match, and they were well content with the success they had gained.

The winter passed, indeed, without any further movement. The Britons suffered to some extent from the damps; but as the whole country was <b>undrained,</b> {{and for the most part}} covered with forest, they were accustomed to a damp laden atmosphere, and so supported the fogs of the Fens far better than they would otherwise have done.|$|E
6000|$|England, on her side, if Union came, was {{accepting}} {{a partner with}} very poor material resources. As regards agriculture, for example, vast regions were untilled, or tilled only in the straths and fertile spots by the hardy clansmen, who could not raise oats enough for their own subsistence, and periodically endured famines. In [...] "the ill years" [...] of William, years of untoward weather, distress had been extreme. In the fertile Lowlands that old grievance, insecurity of tenure, and the raising of rents in proportion to improvements made by the tenants, had baffled agriculture. Enclosures were necessary {{for the protection of}} the crops, but even if tenants or landlords had the energy or capital to make enclosures, the neighbours destroyed them under cloud of night. The old labour-services were still extorted; the tenant's time and strength were not his own. Land was exhausted by absence of fallows and lack of manure. The country was <b>undrained,</b> lochs and morasses covered what is now fertile land, and hillsides now in pasture were under the plough. The once prosperous linen trade had suffered from the war of tariffs.|$|E
60|$|Smoke, {{with the}} dog-team, turned south. His quest was Surprise Lake and the mythical Two Cabins. His {{traverse}} was {{to cut the}} headwaters of the Indian River and cross the unknown region over the mountains to the Stewart River. Here, somewhere, rumour persisted, was Surprise Lake, surrounded by jagged mountains and glaciers, its bottom paved with raw gold. Old-timers, it was said, whose very names were forgotten in the frosts of earlier years, had dived into the icy waters of Surprise Lake and fetched lump-gold to the surface in both hands. At different times, parties of old-timers had penetrated the forbidding fastness and sampled the lake's golden bottom. But the water was too cold. Some died in the water, being pulled up dead. Others died later of consumption. And one who had gone down never did come up. All survivors had planned to return and drain the lake, yet none had ever gone back. Disaster always smote them. One man fell into an air-hole below Forty Mile; another was killed and eaten by his dogs; a third was crushed by a falling tree. And so the tale ran. Surprise Lake was a hoodoo; its location was unremembered; and the gold still paved its <b>undrained</b> bottom.|$|E
60|$|It befell (to go on {{a second}} time) that Sir John, hunting all day, and dining at five, fell asleep every evening, and snored so terribly that all the windows in Harthover shook, and the soot fell down the chimneys. Whereon My Lady, being no more able to get {{conversation}} out of him than a song out of a dead nightingale, determined {{to go off and}} leave him, and the doctor, and Captain Swinger the agent, to snore in concert every evening to their hearts' content. So she started for the seaside with all the children, in order to put herself and them into condition by mild applications of iodine. She might as well have stayed at home and used Parry's liquid horse-blister, for there was plenty of it in the stables; and then she would have saved her money, and saved the chance, also, of making all the children ill instead of well (as hundreds are made), by taking them to some nasty smelling <b>undrained</b> lodging, and then wondering how they caught scarlatina and diphtheria: but people won't be wise enough to understand that till they are dead of bad smells, and then it will be too late; besides you see, Sir John did certainly snore very loud.|$|E
60|$|Do not let {{us believe}} this time, my friends, in the pitiable, insincere {{way in which}} all England {{believed}} when the cholera was here sixteen years ago. When they saw human beings dying by thousands, they all got frightened, and proclaimed a Fast and confessed their sins and promised repentance {{in a general way}}. But did they repent of and confess those sins which had caused the cholera? Did they repent of and confess the covetousness, the tyranny, the carelessness, which in most great towns, and in too many villages also, forces the poor to lodge in <b>undrained</b> stifling hovels, unfit for hogs, amid vapours and smells which send forth on every breath the seeds of rickets and consumption, typhus and scarlet fever, and worse and last of all, the cholera? Did they repent of their sin in that? Not they. Did they repent of the carelessness and laziness and covetousness which sends meat and fish up to all our large towns in a half-putrid state; which fills every corner of London and the great cities with slaughter-houses, over-crowded graveyards, <b>undrained</b> sewers? Not they. To confess their sins in a general way cost them a few words; to confess and repent of the real particular sins in themselves, was a very different matter; to amend them would have touched vested interests, would have cost money, the Englishman's god; it would have required self-sacrifice of pocket, as well as of time. It would have required manful fighting against the prejudices, the ignorance, the self-conceit, the laziness, the covetousness of the wicked world. So they could not afford to repent and amend of all THAT. And when those great and good men, the Sanitary Commissioners, proved to all England fifteen years ago, that cholera always appeared where fever had appeared, and that both fever and cholera always cling exclusively to those places where there was bad food, bad air, crowded bedrooms, bad drainage and filth--that such were the laws of God and Nature, and always had been; they took no notice of it, because it was the poor rather than the rich who suffered from those causes. So the filth of our great cities was left to ferment in poisonous cesspools, foul ditches and marshes and muds, such as those now killing people by hundreds in the neighbourhood of Plymouth; for one house or sewer that was improved, a hundred more were left just {{as they were in the}} first cholera; as soon as the panic of superstitious fear was past, carelessness and indolence returned. Men went back, the covetous man to his covetousness, and the idler to his idleness. And behold! sixteen years are past, and the cholera is as bad as ever among us.|$|E
