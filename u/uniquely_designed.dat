5|$|During the 12th century, {{new designs}} {{began to be}} {{introduced}} – in France, quatrefoil-shaped keeps were introduced, while in England polygonal towers were built. By {{the end of the}} century, French and English keep designs began to diverge: Philip II of France built a sequence of circular keeps as part of his bid to stamp his royal authority on his new territories, while in England castles were built without keeps. In Spain, keeps were increasingly incorporated into both Christian and Islamic castles, although in Germany tall towers called Bergfriede were preferred to keeps in the western fashion. In {{the second half of the}} 14th century, there was a resurgence in the building of keeps. In France, the keep at Vincennes began a fashion for tall, heavily machicolated designs, a trend adopted in Spain most prominently through the Valladolid school of Spanish castle design. Meanwhile, tower keeps in England became popular amongst the most wealthy nobles: these large keeps, each <b>uniquely</b> <b>designed,</b> formed part of the grandest castles built during the period.|$|E

Directly opposite is the St Kilda Public Library built between 1971–1973 at 150 Carlisle Street.

5000|$|Most {{sites in}} the Diploma Plus Network offer a three- to {{four-year}} program or study, and are either small, alternative high schools run by districts or are charter schools. Other Diploma Plus sites are district-supported alternative programs or programs implemented by community colleges in partnership with local school districts that serve students for shorter periods of time. Diploma Plus schools have the autonomy to <b>uniquely</b> <b>design</b> experiences that work for its student population's specific needs. An American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research report {{on the use of}} innovation in schools highlights this characteristic saying, [...] "this means changing schedules, allowing for early-release time for working students, and using different kinds of teachers--all of which run up against traditional state and district rules".|$|R

25|$|The {{playing of}} polyrhythms {{is one of}} the most {{universal}} characteristics of Sub-Sarahan music, in contrast to polyphony in Western music. Several <b>uniquely</b> <b>designed</b> instruments have evolved there over time to facilitate the playing of simultaneous contrasting rhythms. The mbira, kalimba, Kora, Ngoni and dousn'gouni are examples of these instruments which organize notes not in the usual single linear order from bass to treble, but in two separated rank arrays which allows additional ease in playing cross rhythms. The continuing influence of this principle can be seen in the 20th century American instruments the gravi-kora and gravikord which are new modern examples.|$|E
50|$|In the {{aftermath}} of World War I the Australian Government imposed a tariff on imported vehicles, with tax concessions applying to rolling chassis, as a stimulus to develop a sovereign motor vehicle industry. The chassis concession acted as a financial incentive for local coach-builders to import factory built rolling chassis, and fit <b>uniquely</b> Australian <b>designed</b> and built bodies, leading {{to the establishment of}} an Australian motor vehicle bodybuilding industry in the early 1920s.|$|R

This new royal blue tabard, for exclusively Canadian use and of <b>uniquely</b> Canadian <b>design,</b> is a modern take on the traditional look. The tabard differs from others of more traditional design in that the Canadian royal arms appear on the sleeves, while the front and back of the tabard are covered with Native Canadian-inspired emblematic representations of the raven-polar bears of the Canadian Heraldic Authority's coat of arms.|$|R
40|$|Literary {{works are}} {{cultural}} objects of industrial products. Speaking about {{the production of}} literary works meant dealing with laws (systems, mechanisms, and strategies) imposed by the institution concerned-producing, ie the publisher. Therefore, publisher institution (chicklit novel and Teenlit) will create a typical industrial laws, which differ from the laws of other publisher institutions. Systems and mechanisms production of chicklit and Teenlit novel consist of the publisher profile, script acquisition (recruitment), script editing (editing), and script distribution (distribution). Publisher profile includes the publisher history, the publisher specifications and product diversification, {{as well as the}} publisher contact. In the modern business communication, publisher identity is as important as product identity. Consumer 2 ̆ 7 s trust is built through the image depiction of products and publisher, thus publisher profile becomes the main reference for consumers. Therefore, in the publisher profile description, it always emphasized its excellence experience (history) in publishing the kind of novel as mentioned before, the specifications and features of products they produce, as well as the tools and the modern systems- mechanisms production (worker qualification, printing machines, management).

25|$|The {{world of}} concert touring was changed by Kiss's {{practice}} of erecting <b>uniquely</b> <b>designed</b> stage sets. Tours got larger, carrying more personnel and equipment, including sets, costumes, sound and lighting gear, pyrotechnics, all requiring more trucking, {{and the total}} cost increasing by millions of dollars. Kiss also innovated with a significant expansion of concert merchandising, selling non-musical Kiss-branded goods to concertgoers. The sales of merchandise helped pay for the concert expenses and bring a profit to the band as well as give them more of a presence without relying solely on radio. Other bands copied Kiss by selling their own branded goods at concerts, a practice which became more of a necessity in the 1980s with increasing costs of touring.|$|E

500|$|Designs for the {{foundation}} {{were in place}} by early August 2011 and the contract for the piling was being tendered. On 16August 2011, Langan International officially announced their involvement and that {{the foundation}} and piling had to be <b>uniquely</b> <b>designed</b> to overcome subsurface issues such as soft bedrock and porous coral rock, which normally could not support a skyscraper without settling. The foundation will be {{similar to that of}} the Burj Khalifa, but larger; it is expected to average around [...] deep with a concrete pad of area around [...] The concrete will have to have low permeability to keep out corrosive salt water from the Red Sea. Its depth and size are also considered to be an indicator of what the tower's final height will be. The piles will be up to [...] deep and the pad over [...] across, yet even still the building, which will weigh over , is expected to settle. The idea is that it settles evenly enough so that the building doesn't tip or put undue stress on the superstructure. Computer modeling programs performed tests at the site to confirm that the foundation design would work. [...] A later design for the foundation, to be constructed by Bauer in 2013, calls for 270 bored piles up to [...] deep which have to be installed into the difficult ground conditions. Some materials needed for the structure are [...] of concrete and [...] of steel.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Mixing {{upper level}} {{undergraduates}} majoring in engineering with those majoring in biology, we have devised {{a course on}} biologically-inspired design (BID) that provides practical training in methods and techniques that facilitate the identification and translation of biological principles into solutions for human challenges. The challenges of interdisciplinary courses generally, and the specific challenges of fostering exchange among biologists and engineers lead us to define these learning goals: (1) basic knowledge of successful examples of BID, (2) interdisciplinary communication skills, (3) knowledge about domains outside of their core training, (4) a <b>uniquely</b> interdisciplinary <b>design</b> process, and (5) how to apply existing technical knowledge to a new discipline.
