5|$|Production of the fissile {{isotopes}} uranium-235 and plutonium-239 were enormous undertakings {{given the}} technology of the 1940s, and accounted for 80% of the total costs of the project. <b>Uranium</b> <b>enrichment</b> was carried out at the Clinton Engineer Works near Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Theoretically, enriching uranium was feasible through pre-existing techniques, but it proved difficult to scale to industrial levels and was extremely costly. Only 0.71 percent of natural uranium was uranium-235, and {{it was estimated that}} it would take 27,000 years to produce a gram of uranium with mass spectrometers, but kilogram amounts were required.|$|E
5|$|A {{calutron}} is a {{mass spectrometer}} originally designed {{and used for}} separating the isotopes of uranium. It was developed by Ernest Lawrence during the Manhattan Project and was based on his earlier invention, the cyclotron.

Calutrons {{were used in the}} industrial-scale Y-12 <b>uranium</b> <b>enrichment</b> plant at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

40|$|Biases in MGAU {{analyses}} first {{observed in}} FSU Gosatomnadzor inspection and subsequently identified {{in more detail}} by measurements at the Moscow Kurchatov Institute have forced {{a new look at}} the code's analysis assumptions. We have used uranium gamma-ray calibration standards from the National Bureau of Standards and standards from the New Brunswick Laboratory to investigate MGAU analysis biases. The 200 g uranium standards which cover the <b>uranium</b> <b>enrichments</b> ranging from 0. 3 % to 93 % were used to collect more than 500 gamma-ray spectra for this study. The experimental arrangement used a LEPS Ge detector with various source-detector configurations and absorbers. Two independent versions of the MGAU code, which we currently employ in our laboratory, confirm the biases noted in a developing variety of FSU inspection results and in the careful Kurchatov study. In this paper, we will discuss the MGAU methodology and use 250 spectra at a fixed geometry without absorbers to obtain new branching ratios for the critical 100 -keV region gamma rays.

40|$|Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and EG&G ORTEC have jointly {{developed}} a portable ambient-temperature detection {{system that can}} be used in a number of application scenarios. The detection system uses a planar cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) detector with custom-designed detector support electronics {{developed a}}t LLNL and is based on the recently released MicroNOMAD multichannel analyzer (MCA) produced by ORTEC. Spectral analysis is performed using software developed at LLNL that was originally designed for use with high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector systems.

The analysis was performed using sample sizes of 200 g or larger and acquisition times of 30 min.

These experiments demonstrate that current CZT detectors can, in some cases, approach performance criteria that were previously the exclusive domain of larger HPGe detector systems...|$|R
5|$|A {{disappointed}} Oliphant {{flew to the}} United States {{to speak}} to the American scientists. These included Ernest Lawrence at the University of California's Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley. The two men had met before the war, and were friends. Lawrence was sufficiently impressed to commence his own research into uranium. Uranium-235 makes up only about 0.72% of natural uranium, so the separation factor of any <b>uranium</b> <b>enrichment</b> process needs to be higher than 1250 to produce 90% uranium-235 from natural uranium. The Maud Committee had recommended that this be done by a process of gaseous diffusion, but Oliphant had pioneered another technique in 1934: electromagnetic separation. This was the process that Nier had used.|$|E
5|$|At the University of Birmingham in Britain, the Australian {{physicist}} Mark Oliphant assigned two refugee physicists— Frisch and Rudolf Peierls—the task {{of investigating}} {{the feasibility of}} an atomic bomb, ironically because their status as enemy aliens precluded their working on secret projects like radar. Their March 1940 Frisch–Peierls memorandum indicated that the critical mass of uranium-235 was within {{an order of magnitude}} of 10kg, which was small enough to be carried by a bomber of the day. Research into how uranium isotope separation (<b>uranium</b> <b>enrichment)</b> could be achieved assumed enormous importance. Frisch's first thought about how this could be achieved was with liquid thermal diffusion.|$|E
5|$|Because {{uranium-235}} {{was known}} to be fissionable, it was the first material pursued in the approach to bomb development. As the first design developed (as well as the first deployed for combat), it is sometimes known as the Mark I. The vast majority of the work {{came in the form of}} the isotope enrichment of the uranium necessary for the weapon, since uranium-235 makes up only 1 part in 140 of natural <b>uranium.</b> <b>Enrichment</b> was performed at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where the electromagnetic separation plant, known as Y-12, became fully operational in March 1944. The first shipments of highly enriched uranium were sent to the Los Alamos Laboratory in June 1944.|$|E

40|$|A new non-TRISO {{fuel and}} clad design concept is {{proposed}} for the prismatic, heliumcooled Very High Temperature Reactor core. The new concept could substantially reduce the current 10 - 20 wt% TRISO <b>uranium</b> <b>enrichments</b> down to 4 - 6 wt% for both initial and reload cores. The proposed fuel form would be a high-temperature, high-density uranium ceramic, for example UO 2, configured into very small diameter cylindrical rods. The small diameter fuel rods significantly increase core reactivity through improved neutron moderation and fuel lumping. Although a high-temperature clad system for the concept remains to be developed, recent success in tube fabrication and preliminary irradiation testing of silicon carbide (SiC) cladding for light water reactor applications offers good potential for this application, and for future development of other carbide clad designs. A high-temperature ceramic fuel, together with a high-temperature clad material, could also lead to higher thermal safety margins during both normal and transient reactor conditions relative to TRISO fuel. The calculated neutronic {{results show that the}} lowenrichment, small diameter fuel rods and low thermal neutron absorbing clad retain the strong negative Doppler fuel temperature coefficient of reactivity that ensures inherent safe operation of the VHTR, and depletion studies demonstrate that an 18 -month power cycle can be achieved with the lower enrichment fuel...|$|R

5|$|In April 1941, the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), {{created a}} special project headed by Arthur Compton, a Nobel-Prize-winning physics {{professor}} at the University of Chicago, {{to report on the}} uranium program. Compton's report, submitted in May 1941, foresaw the prospects of developing radiological weapons, nuclear propulsion for ships, and nuclear weapons using uranium-235 or the recently discovered plutonium. In October he wrote another report on the practicality of an atomic bomb. For this report, he worked with Fermi on calculations of the critical mass of uranium-235. He also discussed the prospects for <b>uranium</b> <b>enrichment</b> with Harold Urey.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} three years, Libby worked on the gaseous {{diffusion}} process for <b>uranium</b> <b>enrichment.</b> An atomic bomb required fissile material, and the fissile uranium-235 made up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium. The SAM Laboratories therefore {{had to find a}} way of separating kilograms of it from the more abundant uranium-238. Gaseous diffusion worked on the principle that a lighter gas diffuses through a barrier faster than a heavier one at a rate inversely proportional to its molecular weight. But the only known gas containing uranium was the highly corrosive uranium hexafluoride, and a suitable barrier was hard to find.|$|E
5|$|The {{biggest problem}} {{faced by the}} MAUD Committee {{was to find a}} way to {{separate}} the 0.7% of uranium-235 from the 99.3% of uranium-238. This is difficult because the two types of uranium are chemically identical. Separation (<b>uranium</b> <b>enrichment)</b> would have to be achieved at a large scale. At Cambridge, Eric Rideal and his team investigated using a gas centrifuge. Frisch chose to perform gaseous thermal diffusion using Clusius tubes because it seemed the simplest method. Frisch's calculations showed there would need to be 100,000 Clusius tubes to extract the desired separation amount. Peierls turned to Franz Simon, who preferred to find a method more suitable for mass production.|$|E
