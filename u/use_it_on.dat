5|$|Although {{reasonably}} well used, it was unpopular with the public, who objected to being obliged to pay tolls to <b>use</b> <b>it.</b> <b>On</b> 4 July 1857, {{almost a year}} before the bridge's opening, a demonstration against the tolls attracted 6,000 residents. Concerns were raised in Parliament that poorer industrial workers in Chelsea, which had no large parks of its own, would be unable to afford to use the new park in Battersea. Bowing to public pressure, shortly after the bridge opened Parliament declared it free to use for pedestrians on Sundays, and in 1875 it was also made toll-free on public holidays. Additionally, because the main lights were only turned on when Queen Victoria was staying in London, it was poorly used at night. Despite this, the new Battersea Park was extremely popular, particularly the sporting facilities; on 9 January 1864 the park staged the world's first official game of association football.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Paul Steiner (Bryant Haliday) and Dr. Christopher Mitchell (Ronald Allen) {{work on a}} {{projection}} device {{that enables them to}} transmit any object within a few miles of the machine. While they find the device works with inanimate objects, the living creatures they <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> always seem to die. When Dr. Patricia Hill (Mary Peach) arrives, she helps them fix the error, making Steiner think the problem has been solved. Meanwhile, Dr. Blanchard (Norman Wooland), Steiner's boss and head of the institute he works for, is being blackmailed by Mr. Latham (Derrick De Marney), who wants credit for Steiner's discovery. He forces Blanchard to demand Steiner to give a premature presentation to Professor Lembach (Gerard Heinz).|$|E

5|$|In 2007, BBC archive {{specialist}} James Insell {{established the}} Colour Recovery Working Group, an online project {{to find new}} ways of restoring black-and-white telerecordings to colour. In 2008, Reverse Standards Conversion inventor Richard Russell, developed a technique involving the use of chroma dots embedded in the black-and-white signal to recreate the missing color. This technique was initially used as part of the recolouring process on episode 3 of Planet of the Daleks; the chroma dot process was used alongside a computer-based colourisation process to match together the differing qualities of colour recovery. The process was then used on an entire episode of Dad's Army, showing {{that it was possible to}} <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> entire recordings.|$|E
5|$|Returning to New York, he and Thomashefsky jointly leased The People's Theater, {{intending}} to <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> different nights of the week. Adler, exhausted from his Russian trip, was often leaving his nights unused, and Thomashefsky {{offered to buy}} him out for $10,000 {{on the condition that}} he would not return to performing in New York. Adler was so insulted that the two did not speak for months, even though at the time they were living across a courtyard from one another, and could see into each other's St. Mark's Place apartments. Adler decided to perform Tolstoy's The Power of Darkness, and decided that he would do his own translation from Russian to Yiddish. The play was a great success, the first successful production of a Tolstoy play in the U.S., and Thomashefsky was so obviously happy for Adler that their friendship was renewed. Adler followed with equally successful productions of Gordin's dramatization of Tolstoy's Resurrection and the Gordin original The Homeless.|$|E
5|$|With the {{prospects}} of {{a link between the}} navigation and the Basingstoke Canal being constructed, the undertaking was valued at £24,000, and D'Arcy sold a half share in it to his agent, George Hollis. He then sold the other half to him, and moved to Ireland. Hollis became the sole proprietor from 1804, having bought out his sleeping partner. Throughout its life, the navigation had almost been a monopoly, but Hollis planned to end this, and obtained an Act of Parliament in 1802, to make it an open navigation, where anyone could <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> payment of the appropriate tolls. These were laid down in the Act, ending the setting of tolls by the Commissioners. The Act also specified that he had three years to put the river in order, which he appears to have achieved, since he then leased it to a group of merchants.|$|E

5|$|Woodpeckers {{have strong}} bills for {{drilling}} and drumming on trees, and long sticky tongues for extracting food. Woodpecker bills are typically longer, sharper {{and stronger than}} the bills of piculets and wrynecks; however, their morphology is very similar. The bill's chisel-like tip is kept sharp by the pecking action in birds that regularly <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> wood. The beak consists of three layers; an outer sheath called rhamphotheca, made of scales formed from keratin proteins, an inner layer of bone which has a large cavity and mineralised collagen fibers, and a middle layer made of porous bone which connects the two other layers. Combined, this anatomy helps the beak absorb mechanical stress. Species of woodpecker and flicker that use their bills in soil or for probing as opposed to regular hammering tend to have longer and more decurved bills. Due to their smaller bill size, many piculets and wrynecks will forage in decaying wood more often than woodpeckers. The long sticky tongues, which possess bristles, aid these birds in grabbing and extracting insects from deep within a hole in a tree. It {{has been reported that}} the tongue was used to spear grubs, but more detailed studies published in 2004 have shown that the tongue instead wraps around the prey before being pulled out.|$|E
5|$|The federal jury convicted Cisneros of {{the murder}} on May 12 after three hours of deliberation. The {{prosecution}} introduced witnesses, including the motel manager and those at the crime scene, who stated that they saw a white car driven by the suspected assassins coming from Mexico {{the day before the}} shooting. The defense told the jurors that there was not enough evidence to uphold the conviction under federal requirements of reasonable doubt. The government concluded that it met the burden of proof for interstate or foreign commerce charges in two ways: through Garza's phone calls from Mexico, and through the matching license plates of the Mexican car that crossed into the U.S. and registered at the motel, which matched the description of the vehicle seen at the murder scene. In order to find Cisneros guilty, they were not required to prove that she intended to use interstate or foreign commerce, or even that she knew it would be used. They were required to prove that someone involved in Fischer's murder used interstate or foreign commerce or caused another person to <b>use</b> <b>it.</b> <b>On</b> July 27, the jury rendered their final verdict and sentenced Cisneros to life in prison. Two years later, the United States Attorney Office recognized two local police officers and three FBI agents for assisting in her prosecution.|$|E
