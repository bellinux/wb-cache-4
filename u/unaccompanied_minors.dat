The U.S. federal government provides funds to certain states that administer the URM program, typically through a state refugee coordinator’s office. The state refugee coordinator provides financial and programmatic oversight to the URM programs {{in his or her}} state. The state refugee coordinator ensures that <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> in URM programs receive the same benefits and services as other children in out-of-home care in the state. The state refugee coordinator also oversees the needs of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> with many other stakeholders.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reflects}} {{the results of}} a study, the main objective of which was to investigate the practical treatment of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minor</b> refugees in Ghana and South Africa, and to explore whether such treatment is in accordance with existing international norms and standards for the protection of refugee children. The study focused on the realisation of children's socio-economic rights in order to measure treatment. The paper seeks to address the obstacles which prevent the proper treatment of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minor</b> refugees, and to make recommendations as to how the international community can better regulate the treatment of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minor</b> refugees. In essence, this paper aims to investigate whether there is a discrepancy between the rights of child refugees acknowledged in international law, and the situation of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minor</b> refugees in practice and, if so, how this can be remedied. The paper seeks to show, through the case studies of Ghana and South Africa, that <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minor</b> refugees are, to a certain extent, lost in the system...|$|R

2500|$|A 2016 {{study found}} that Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), which allows {{unauthorized}} immigrants who migrated to the United States before their 16th birthday and prior to June 2007 to temporarily stay, did not significantly impact the number of apprehensions of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> from Central America. Rather, [...] "the 2008 Williams Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, along with violence in the originating countries and economic conditions in both the countries of origin and the United States, emerge {{as some of the}} key determinants of the recent surge in <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> apprehended along the southwest US-Mexico border." [...] According to a 2015 report by the Government Accountability Office, the primary drivers of the surge [...] "were crime and lack of economic opportunity at home. Other reasons included education concerns, desire to rejoin family and aggressive recruiting by smugglers." [...] A 2017 Center for Global Development study stated that violence was the primary driver behind the surge in unaccompanied Central American minors to the United States: an additional 10 homicides in Central America made 6 unaccompanied children flee to the US.|$|E

40|$|<b>Unaccompanied</b> <b>minor</b> {{asylum seekers}} in the Netherlands are {{currently}} housed on either a large- or small-scale reception, {{provided by the}} Central Agency for the Reception of Asylum seekers (COA). Next year, large scale reception will be closed: all <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minor</b> asylum seekers will be received in small-scale receptions, ranging from 12 to 20 young people. At small-scale receptions employees often work alone day and night, which can cause problems when they face aggression during work. There {{is a lack of}} knowledge concerning which factors influence employees’ safety when working with <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minor</b> asylum seekers. The aim {{of this study is to}} examine employees’ experiences with safety when working alone, and to analyze which circumstances provide safe or rather unsafe working conditions. Therefore, 13 employees from different small- and large- scale receptions were interviewed. The findings showed that the participants in general do not appreciate working alone: most employees prefer working with a colleague, due to limited possibilities of responding to crises situations. Factors that influenced the experience of safety positively were a good team ambiance, active leadership and sufficient opportunities for training employees. Negative circumstances contained violent incidents towards employees, either verbal or non-verbal violence, and employees’ opportunities to transfer a <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minor</b> asylum seeker when necessary. Finally, none of the employees believes it responsible to work alone when a small-scale reception provides housing for more than 12 young people...|$|R

The cinema also prohibits talking and texting during the film. Anyone who violates this policy is subject to warning and potential removal from the premises.

40|$|How can Social Farming support <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minor</b> refugees? Expert {{interviews}} with stakeholders from agricultural and refugee relief backgrounds {{have been carried}} out to elaborate conceptual baselines. The study shows that Social Farming has a high potential to support <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minor</b> refugees. Existing concepts of farms integrating young people have to be adapted to fit the demands of young refugees. Models of qualification and traineeship have to be implemented as well as therapeutic work. Also the personal resilience of adolescents with foreign cultural backgrounds and their experience of war and violence have to be taken into account. Farmers need skills like intercultural and pedagogical competences as well as support by legal guardians and social workers...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an ethnographic {{case study on}} project Safety Net, which {{provides}} psychosocial peer support for <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minor</b> asylum seekers in the Helsinki metropolitan area. About 150 underage asylum seekers unaccompanied by family arrive in Finland yearly. Project Safety Net peer tutors visit the group homes that the children live in, and {{provide an opportunity for}} them to share their experiences in their own languages. The aims of this research were to understand the circumstances of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minor</b> asylum seekers, and to gain insight into {{the ways in which the}} provided peer support works. This study also critically considers how child asylum seekers are represented in the practices and rhetoric of the Finnish asylum process, and how project Safety Net relates to these representations. Methods used in this research included participant observation, interviews, and group discussions. The data was analyzed thematically and systematically. For <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minor</b> asylum seekers, factors that increase the need for support were found to be separation from family, the inherent temporariness of the asylum seeker status and a concern for the future, language difficulties, a feeling of isolation, and developmental issues related to adolescence...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} is an {{exploratory}} study based on quantitative data from 62 <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minor</b> refugees. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine risks and resources in their social networks after resettlement, in addition to the level of depression symptoms, and how these factors were associated. It was also explored whether social support had a moderating effect in the link between interpersonal stressors and depression symptoms. The focus of this study is on ongoing interpersonal stressors, reflected by worries about family members abroad and problems in relation to friends in Norway, in addition to perceived social support from these two sources. Results indicated that <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minor</b> refugees had high levels of depression symptoms, and that aspects of their social support network have a significant impact on their well-being. Moderator effects of social support were not found. This study is unique in that it explores aspects of the social network that may promote or prevent positive adaptation among <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minor</b> refugees after resettlement. As this study is based on a relatively small sample, more work is needed to understand this process and to validate findings...|$|R
