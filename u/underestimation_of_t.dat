40|$|Abstract Purpose to {{evaluate}} the agreement between the clinical and pathological stagings of breast cancer based on clinical and molecular features. Methods this was a cross-sectional study, in which clinical, epidemiological and pathological {{data were collected from}} 226 patients who underwent surgery at the Prof. Dr. José Aristodemo Pinotti Women's Hospital (CAISM/Unicamp) from January 2008 to September 2010. Patients were staged clinically and pathologically, and were classified as: understaged, when the clinical staging was lower than the pathological staging; correctly staged, when the clinical staging was the same as the pathological one; and overstaged, when the clinical staging was greater than the pathological staging. Results understaged patients were younger (52. 2 years; p < 0. 01) and more symptomatic at diagnosis (p = 0. 04) when compared with correctly or overstaged patients. Clinicopathological surrogate subtype, menopausal status, parity, hormone replace therapy and histology were not associated with differences in staging. Women under 57 years of age were clinically understaged mainly due to <b>underestimation</b> <b>of</b> <b>T</b> (tumor staging) (p < 0. 001), as were the premenopausal women (p < 0. 01). Patients whose diagnosis was made due to clinical complaints, and not by screening, were clinically understaged due to underestimation of N (lymph nodes staging) (p < 0. 001). Conclusion the study shows that the clinicopathological surrogate subtype is not associated with differences in staging, while younger women diagnosed because of clinical complaints tend to have their breast tumors understaged during clinical evaluation...|$|E
40|$|In this work, the Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison (CFMIP) Observation Simulation Package (COSP) is {{expanded}} to include scattering and emission effects of clouds and precipitation at passive microwave frequencies. This represents an advancement over the official version of COSP (version 1. 4. 0) in which only clear-sky brightness temperatures are simulated. To highlight the potential utility of this new microwave simulator, COSP results generated using the climate model EC-Earth's version 3 atmosphere as input are compared with Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS) channel (190. 311 GHz) observations. Specifically, simulated seasonal brightness temperatures (T B) are contrasted with MHS observations for the period December 2005 to November 2006 to identify possible biases in EC-Earth's cloud and atmosphere fields. The EC-Earth's atmosphere closely reproduces the microwave signature {{of many of the}} major large-scale and regional scale features of the atmosphere and surface. Moreover, greater than 60 % of the simulated T B are within 3 K of the NOAA- 18 observations. However, COSP is unable to simulate sufficiently low T B in areas of frequent deep convection. Within the Tropics, the model's atmosphere can yield an <b>underestimation</b> <b>of</b> <b>T</b> B by nearly 30 K for cloudy areas in the ITCZ. Possible reasons for this discrepancy include both incorrect amount of cloud ice water in the model simulations and incorrect ice particle scattering assumptions used in the COSP microwave forward model. These multiple sources of error highlight the non-unique nature of the simulated satellite measurements, a problem exacerbated by the fact that EC-Earth lacks detailed micro-physical parameters necessary for accurate forward model calculations. Such issues limit the robustness of our evaluation and suggest a general note of caution when making COSP-satellite observation evaluations...|$|E
40|$|The {{exceptional}} {{soft tissue}} contrast of which MRI benefits, {{makes it an}} important tool for medical diagnosis. Not only the contrast itself, but also the possible quantification of relaxation times T 1 and T 2 causing this contrast is of interest. This quantification {{has proven to be}} clinically useful in the context of neurological diseases such as schizophrenia, autism, Parkinson’s disease and many others. The principle method used to quantify transverse relaxation time T 2 is the spin echo (SE) sequence which takes rather long. T 2 quantification for medical diagnosis is not often used because of this. A recently developed T 2 quantification method, driven equilibrium single pulse observation of T 2 (DESPOT 2) offers the possibility of volumetric T 2 quantification within a clinical acceptable time with a resolution of less than 1 mm isotropic. The DESPOT 2 method uses two balanced steady state free precession (bSSFP) acquisitions and prior knowledge of T 1 to determine T 2. The bSSFP acquisition on brain tissue is known to be magnetization transfer (MT) sensitive. Within this thesis’ chapter 2, the effect of MT on the observed T 2 by DESPOT 2 is investigated, and the outcome compared to the SE observation of T 2. Within this chapter it is presented that MT reduces the observed T 2 and that this reduction can be avoided by the use of elongated excitation pulses. The introduction of elongated RF excitation pulses introduces finite pulse effects: magnetization decay during part of the RF excitation pulse. Since the DESPOT 2 method is based on a theory assuming instantaneous excitation, the observed T 2 calculation in this case contains a flaw which error size depends on the RF pulse duration. In chapter 3, the finite pulse effect on the DESPOT 2 T 2 calculation is investigated and a correction for this effect is presented. The DESPOT 2 theory with incorporated finite pulse effect allows the observation of T 2 to be independent of the RF pulse duration. Although it is now possible to acquire MT free bSSFP images and calculate the T 2 with the DESPOT 2 method without the finite pulse effect manipulating the observed T 2 value, the DESPOT 2 method still underestimates the T 2 compared to the T 2 observed by SE. In chapter 4 it is shown that this underestimation is caused by the microscopic complexity of brain tissue which is overlooked by the observation of a single T 2. Within the limit of a single pool the two methods observe approximately identical T 2 values since the single pool model on which both methods are based is restored. In brain tissue, the pool fractions are not approaching this limit and therefore the T 2 observed by the two methods is different. Within the SE observation, T 2 does not depend on the echo spacing as is commonly thought; however, the time span over which the T 2 decay is sampled should be longer than the T 2 observed. The DESPOT 2 observation depends strongly on the flip angles used; however, as long as both flip angles remain << 90 ° the T 2 observed is always lower than that observed by SE. Further, {{the difference between the two}} methods has shown to be depending stronger on the fractional pool sizes than on the exchange rates. Although the MT effect within the bSSFP acquisitions can be avoided by elongated RF excitation pulses and the thereby introduced finite pulse effects corrected within the DESPOT 2 T 2 calculation, the DESPOT 2 method still overlooks the microscopic complexity of brain tissue. Because of this, an <b>underestimation</b> <b>of</b> <b>T</b> 2 compared to SE T 2 observations occurs, of which the amount depends on the fractional pool sizes and the exchange rates. ...|$|E
30|$|There were {{limitations}} of this study. Firstly, although we collected blood samples for measuring the radioactivity levels during the scan, the blood sampling time was {{not consistent with the}} scan time of each blood pool. The blood sampling radioactivity measured to the nearest time and the radioactivity of the blood pool on the PET images were compared. Secondly, regarding the <b>underestimation</b> <b>of</b> tumor radioactivity (<b>T)</b> due to the partial volume effect of the current PET scanner, it has been recommended to use maximal value of tumor radioactivity within the voxel of interest. We expect the improvement of spatial resolution and sensitivity of the present PET scanner and the development of, appropriate image reconstruction algorithm and image analysis software may be better for spatial resolution and sensitivity.|$|R
40|$|Revegetation of {{semi-desert}} rangeland {{is dependent}} on rainfall, weather, and soil factors affecting seed germination and seedling establishment. To aid in predicting seed zone temperature and moisture following rainfall, a weather driven one-dimensional computer model was developed to simulate the simultaneous flow of heat and water within a bare semi-desert soil. The Newton-Raphson method was used to solve the surface energy budget equation for surface temperature. The coupled soil heat and water flow equations were then solved numerically using the weighted average finite-difference method to calculate the subsurface temperature (T(s)) and water content (θᵥ) profiles. Weather data and soil thermal and hydraulic properties were the only required inputs to the model. The model was tested using two data sets collected in the Altar Valley of Arizona during the summer rainy season of 1988. Data set 1, collected from calendar day (CD) 198 to 205, was used to calibrate the model. Calibration tests revealed that the model markedly underestimated T(s) when measured values exceeded 37 °C. <b>Underestimation</b> <b>of</b> <b>T(s)</b> {{was found to be}} related to overestimation of latent heat flux. Therefore, the modelled latent heat flux was reduced as a linear function of air temperature (Tₐᵢᵣ) when Tₐᵢᵣ > 30 °C. Also, soil thermal conductivity values predicted by the de Vries model had to be reduced 80 % in order to achieve acceptable agreement between measured and modelled T(s). Data set 2, from CD 191 to 195, was then used to validate the calibrated (modified) model. Results obtained with data set 2 indicated that the modified model accurately simulated T(s) at 0. 01 m depth even when the measured T(s) at that depth exceeded 50 °C. Simulated T(s) values for the soil profile were generally within ± 3 °C of the measured values. Results also showed good agreement between modelled and measured net radiation flux densities. In addition, the modified model predicted surface layer (0 - 0. 03 m) moisture content remained wet enough for seed germination, i. e. θᵥ > 0. 09 m³ m⁻³, about 24 to 36 hours longer than indicated by measured (resistance block) θᵥ values...|$|R
40|$|The {{enumeration}} <b>of</b> total <b>T</b> cells, {{an important}} {{function of the}} clinical immunology laboratory, utilizes antibodies to CD 3, the macromolecular complex associated with the antigen-specific receptors <b>of</b> <b>T</b> cells. We compared the ability of some commonly employed commercial anti-CD 3 reagents to stain human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Surprisingly, the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugate <b>of</b> Coulter clone <b>T</b> 3 (FITC-T 3) stained most T cells brightly, but selectively stained gamma delta T cells very dimly {{or not at all}}. In contrast, the other anti-CD 3 reagents studied (FITC-Leu 4, PE-T 3, PE-Leu 4, and indirectly labelled T 3 and Leu 4) stained all T cells equivalently. Dual-colour flow cytometric analysis with FITC-T 3 and PE-Leu 4 readily demonstrated a FITC-T 3 -/PE-Leu 4 + population <b>of</b> <b>T</b> cells. This unique population stained dimly or not at all with a combination of anti-CD 4 and anti-CD 8 monoclonal antibodies and positively with the pan-gamma delta T cell antibody TCR delta 1. Moreover, an excellent correlation was found between the number of FITC-T 3 -/PE-Leu 4 + cells and the number of TCR delta 1 + cells in 32 normal individuals. Thus, the FITC-T 3 -/PE-Leu 4 + phenotype accurately marks all gamma delta T cells. In contrast to FITC-T 3, both PE-conjugated and unconjugated T 3 stained gamma delta T cells brightly. Therefore, T 3 binds to an epitope present on all T cells, but fluoresceinylation specifically attenuates this antibody's ability to bind to gamma delta T cells. These findings indicate that the use of FITC-T 3 can result in a significant and variable <b>underestimation</b> <b>of</b> peripheral blood <b>T</b> cell number and demonstrate further that the CD 3 complexes of human alpha beta and gamma delta T cells are significantly different...|$|R

30|$|First, our {{findings}} indicated that the CTCAE grades and {{the responses to the}} PRO-CTCAE did not identically correspond. Thus, we evaluated the discordance of adverse event assessment in this study, via patient self-assessment using the PRO-CTCAE, in patients assessed by medical staff as having no adverse events, via the CTCAE. <b>Underestimation</b> <b>of</b> adverse events by clinicians have been previously reported using the CTCAE and/or EORTC QLQ-C 30 [3, 4, 7]. These reports have consistently shown an <b>underestimation</b> <b>of</b> fatigue, pain, and constipation by clinicians, a trend mirrored in the current study. Additionally, our results also showed that anxiety was underestimated. The Japanese version of the PRO-CTCAE was shown to have properties similar to trends demonstrated in previous studies utilizing this measure in other countries. In Japan, there is a dearth of research examining the <b>underestimation</b> <b>of</b> adverse events. Okamoto has proposed that patients believe that doctors do not actively engage in listening to their concerns, while doctors tend to believe that patients are not willing to voice their opinions [34]. Within the unique context of Japanese physician-patient relationships, the Japanese version of the PRO-CTCAE is considered likely to affect the <b>underestimation</b> <b>of</b> adverse events, resulting in a more appropriate assessment. Finally, although this study revealed the existence <b>of</b> <b>underestimation</b> <b>of</b> adverse events in Japan, the sample utilized contained multiple different cancer types and treatment regimens. Further studies will be necessary to clarify discordance of particular treatments and/or cancer-type-specific adverse event assessments.|$|R

Direct comparisons with measured data and statistical indices show that modelled results are within the range of acceptance.
