25|$|The town's natural {{landmark}} is Western Beacon; a {{hill that}} overlooks the town. People walk <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> {{the views of}} Ivybridge and the South Hams. The town's first manmade landmark is the Ivy Bridge; a 13th-century hump-backed bridge covered in Ivy. It is still in use today and gives {{the name of the}} town – Ivybridge. The two remaining industrial landmarks of the town are the viaduct over the River Erme and the paper mill. The original viaduct was built by Isambard Kingdom Brunel in 1848, only the granite piers remain. The operational line alongside was built by Sir James Charles Inglis opened in 1894 for the Great Western Railway. It still carries the mainline trains. They were key to the town's initial growth in the Industrial Revolution and are still importance to the town today. In the centre of the town a war memorial, equidistant from three of the churches, was unveiled in 1922 and each year on Remembrance Day the town holds a ceremony to those who lost their lives. In recent years another memorial has also been built nearby commemorating the lives of American servicemen stationed in and near the town in 1943-1944, many of whom died on Omaha Beach on D-Day. The Watermark is one of the town's modern landmarks, which began construction in 2007 and was completed in March 2008 at a cost of £1.4 million. It functions as a library, entertainment venue, cinema and offers office space.|$|E
500|$|Likewise {{the first}} film, {{the film was}} shot in and around Vancouver Island. [...] "We know the arena, we know the people up there and let's be honest, there’s an {{enormous}} economic incentive to shoot there. We were very fortunate to get [...] Justis Greene, who’s been working as a line producer <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> 30 years and {{who was able to}} get us the best crew working in town right now. It was advantageous to us on so many levels, that it was just the right place to go for this movie," [...] Perry stated as the reason for the film's production in British Columbia. British Columbia Highway 19 was utilized as Route 23. The Plaza of Nations was used as a stand-in for Ellis Medical Complex, the site of Tim's death.|$|E

500|$|... "Mothers of the Disappeared" [...] was favourably {{received}} by critics. Steve Morse of The Boston Globe called the song [...] "powerful" [...] {{and described the}} backing vocals as tender and choirlike. Don McLeese of the Chicago Sun-Times {{described it as a}} [...] "hymn to human rights". Adrian Thrills of NME called it [...] "a simple, plaintive lament of stunning beauty and sadness". Nicholas Jennings of Maclean's felt that it was The Joshua Trees [...] "most topical song". Music journalist Andrew Mueller felt the track was a [...] "wilfully downbeat finale". In Rolling Stone, Steve Pond said [...] "'Mothers of the Disappeared' is built around desolate images of loss, but the setting is soothing and restorative—music of great sadness but also of unutterable compassion, acceptance and calm." [...] Lennox Samuels of The Dallas Morning News stated that there was [...] "an ineffable sadness in Bono's vocals and images where 'Night hangs like a prisoner / Stretched over black and blue'", calling it [...] "a moving tribute" [...] to people around the world who had lost loved ones to warfare and conflict. He added [...] "hat's remarkable about the song is that despite the intrinsic pain, it remains eerily cleansing. Even in the midst of decay and excess and horror, Bono can find hope and absolution." [...] In 2006 Bono described it as [...] "a beautiful end to the album", saying, [...] "That song means as much to me as any of the songs on that album, it's right <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> me," [...] and noting that it is a song [...] "I'm very proud of to this day." ...|$|E
500|$|The British Army {{was armed}} with the Short Magazine Lee–Enfield Mk III (SMLE Mk III), which {{featured}} a bolt-action and large magazine capacity that enabled a trained rifleman to fire 20–30 aimed rounds a minute. World War I accounts tell of British troops repelling German attackers, who subsequently {{reported that they had}} encountered machine guns, when in fact, it was simply a group of trained riflemen armed with SMLEs. The heavy Vickers machine gun proved itself to be the most reliable weapon on the battlefield, with some of its feats of endurance entering military mythology. One account tells of the action by the 100th Company of the Machine Gun Corps at High Wood on 24 August 1916. This company had 10 Vickers guns; it was ordered to give sustained covering fire for 12 hours onto a selected area [...] away, to prevent German troops forming <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> a counterattack while a British attack was in progress. Two companies of infantry were allocated as ammunition, rations and water carriers for the gunners. Two men worked a belt–filling machine non–stop for 12 hours, keeping up a supply of 250-round belts. They used 100 new barrels and all of the water—including the men's drinking water and the contents of the latrine buckets—to keep the guns cool. In that 12-hour period, the 10 guns fired just short of one million rounds between them. One team is reported to have fired 120,000. At the close of the operation, it is alleged that every gun was working perfectly and that not one had broken down during the whole period.|$|E
2500|$|In August 1933, after Hitler came to power, Dubnow {{moved to}} Riga, Latvia. [...] There his wife died, yet he {{continued}} his activities, also writing his autobiography Book of My Life. [...] On the initiative of a Latvian Jewish refugee activist in Stockholm and {{with help from the}} local Jewish community in Sweden, Dubnow was granted a visa to Sweden in the summer of 1940 but for unknown reasons he never used it. Then in July 1941 Nazi troops occupied Riga. Dubnow was evicted, losing his entire library. With thousands of Jews he was transferred to the Riga ghetto. [...] According to the few remaining survivors, Dubnow repeated to ghetto inhabitants: Yidn, shraybt un farshraybt ( [...] , write and record"). He was among thousands of Jews to be rounded <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> the Rumbula massacre. [...] Too sick to travel to the forest, he was murdered in the city on 8 December 1941. Several friends then buried Simon Dubnow in the old cemetery of the Riga ghetto.|$|E
