5000|$|Welwitschia has an {{elongated}} shallow root system consisting of [...] "a tapering taproot {{with one or}} more non-tapering extensions, some pronounced lateral roots, and a network of delicate spongy roots." [...] and a woody fibrous <b>unbranched</b> <b>main</b> stem. [...] The roots extend to a depth roughly equal to the span of the living leaves from tip to tip. The main stem consists of an unbranched woody crown roughly shaped like an inverted cone. The only branching in the shoot system occurs in the reproductive branches, which bear strobili.|$|E
40|$|Using {{a variety}} of optical and electrooptical {{techniques}} as well as dielectric spectroscopy, we have investigated three homologues in the chiral liquid crystal series nF 1 M 7, where n denotes {{the length of the}} <b>unbranched</b> side-chain. The <b>main</b> focus of the study is the series of smectic C subphases, i. e. SmCa*, SmC 1 / 3 * and SmC 1 / 4 *. During switching in the SmCa* phase, a peculiar redirection of the plane of biaxiality, distinguishing this phase from SmA* and SmC*, was observed. We present a simple explanation for this behaviour which correlates well with the clock model description of the SmCa* phase. We found a zero mesoscopic polarisation for the SmC 1 / 4 * phase and a non-zero mesoscopic polarisation for SmC 1 / 3 *, observations which are consistent with a distorted clock model. The dielectric spectroscopy investigations, performed at several different cell gaps, clearly show that the dielectric response in these materials is easily dominated by surface-induced structures if the cell gap is reduced, and thus reflects the bulk thermodynamic phase in very thick cells only...|$|R
60|$|Female Organs.--M. Martin St. Ange has {{described}} how the peduncle[19] is gorged with an inextricable mass of branching ovarian tubes, filled with granular matter and immature ova. In Conchoderma and Alepas, the ovarian tubes run up {{in a single}} plane (Pl. IX, fig. 3,) between the two folds of corium round the sack. Here {{the development of the}} ova can be well followed: a minute point first branches out from one of the tubes; its head then enlarges, like the bud of a tulip on a footstalk; becomes globular; shows traces of dividing, and at last splits into three, four, or five egg-shaped balls, which finally separate as perfect ova. Within the peduncle, the ovarian tubes branch out in all directions, and within the footstalks of the branches (differently from what takes place round the sack), ova are developed, as well as at their ends. Close together, along the rostral (i. e., ventral) edge of the peduncle, two nearly straight, main ovarian tubes or ducts may be detected, which do not give out any branches till about half way down the peduncle, where they subdivide into branches, which inosculate together, and give rise to the mass filling the peduncle, and sometimes, as we have just seen, sending up branches round the sack. These two <b>main</b> <b>unbranched</b> ovarian ducts, followed up the peduncle, are seen to enter the body of the Cirripede (close along side the great double peduncular nerves), and then separating, they sweep in a large curve along each flank of the prosoma, under the superficial muscles, towards the bases of the first pair of cirri; and then rising up, they run into two glandular masses. These latter rest on the upper edge of the stomach, and touch the c√¶ca where such exist; they were thought by Cuvier to be salivary glands. They are of an orange colour, and form two, parallel, gut-formed masses, having, in Conchoderma, a great flexure, and generally dividing at the end near the mouth into a few blunt branches. I was not able to ascertain whether the two main ducts, coming from the peduncle, expanded to envelope them, or what the precise connection was. The state of these two masses varied much; sometimes they were hollow, with only their walls spotted with a few cellular little masses; at other times they contained or rather were formed of, more or less globular or finger-shaped aggregations of pulpy matter; and lastly, the whole consisted of separate pointed little balls, each with a large inner cell, and this again with two or three included granules. These so closely resembled, in general appearance and size, the ovigerms with their germinal vesicles and spots, which I have often seen at the first commencement of the formation of the ova in the ovarian tubes in the peduncle, that I cannot doubt that such is their nature. Hence I conclude, that these two gut-formed masses are the true ovaria. I may add, that several times I have seen in the two long, unbranched ducts, connecting the true ovaria and the ovarian tubes in the peduncle, pellets of orange-coloured cellular matter (i. e., ovigerms) forming at short intervals little enlargements in the ducts, and apparently travelling into the peduncle.|$|R
