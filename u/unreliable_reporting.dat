40|$|Introduction: The {{incidence}} of anal cancer, whose primary cause is human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, {{has increased in}} United States (US) men almost three-fold in three decades; however, {{little is known about}} the epidemiology of anal HPV, especially in heterosexual men. Furthermore, advancements in knowledge about the epidemiology of anal HPV may be hampered by measurement error in the collection of sexual behavior data. Methods: From two US cities, behavioral data and anal biological specimens were collected from 253 men who acknowledged sexual intercourse with a woman in the previous year. PCR and genotyping were used to assess the presence of HPV DNA. In addition, two HPV questionnaires were assessed for test-retest reliability: the first was a self-administered questionnaire associated with the collection of the biological specimens while the second was a computer-assisted self-interview (CASI) with 1069 men in Brazil, Mexico, and the US. Results: Based on DNA analysis, overall anal HPV prevalence was 24. 8 % in 222 men who acknowledged no prior sexual intercourse with men. Risk factors independently associated with anal HPV were lifetime number of female sexual partners and frequency of sex with females in the past month. Based on kappa and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), both HPV questionnaires were found to be highly reliable with low refusal rates; however, three discrete measures in the multi-national interview asking for the number of sexual partners had lower reliability. The ICC of these questions increased to greater than or equal to 0. 79 when a small number of extreme outliers (less than or equal to 3) were removed. Predictors of <b>unreliable</b> <b>reporting</b> were age and lifetime number of female sexual partners while years of education was inversely associated with <b>unreliable</b> <b>reporting.</b> Discussion: These results suggest anal HPV is common in heterosexual men. Risk factors associated with anal HPV did not explain how HPV was transmitted to the anal region. Both instruments used to collect sexual behavior data were highly reliable including the CASI instrument used in three culturally and linguistically distinct countries; however, caution is warranted with discrete measures that ask participants to report the number of sexual partners...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} ten years, {{long-range}} dependence (LRD) has become a key concept in modeling networking phenomena. The research community has undergone a mental shift from Poisson and memoryless processes to LRD and bursty processes. Despite its popularity, LRD analysis is hindered by two main problems: a) it cannot be used by nonexperts easily, and b) the identification of LRD is often questioned and disputed. The main cause for both these problems {{is the absence of}} a systematic and unambiguous way to identify the existence of LRD. This paper has two main thrusts. First, we explore the (lack of) accuracy and robustness in LRD estimation. We find that the current estimation methods can often be inaccurate and <b>unreliable,</b> <b>reporting</b> LRD erroneously. We search for the source of such problems and identify a number of caveats and common mistakes. For example, some of the methods misinterpret short-range correlations for LRD. Second, we develop methods to improve the robustness of the estimation. Through case studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in overcoming most known caveats. Finally, we integrate all required functionality and methods in an easy to use software tool. Our work is a first step towards a systematic approach and a comprehensive tool for the reliable estimation of LRD. I...|$|E
40|$|Cancer {{has become}} a global {{pandemic}} with disproportionately higher mortality rates in low- and middle- income countries, where a large fraction of patients present in advanced stages {{and in need of}} end-of-life care. Globally, the number of adults needing end-of-life care is greater than 19 million, and up to 78 % of these patients are living in low- and middle- income countries. In the Americas alone, more than one million people are in need of end-of-life care, placing an enormous burden on local health systems, which are often unprepared to meet the challenge presented by this complex patient population. In Latin America, cancer care is characterized by the presence of vast inequalities between and within countries, and the provision of end-of-life care is no exception. Disparities in access to advanced care planning, with a lack of provision of adequate palliative care and pain medication, are common in the region. These shortcomings are related in large part to inadequate or inappropriate legislation, lack of comprehensive national palliative care plans, insufficient infrastructure, lack of opportunities for clinical training, <b>unreliable</b> <b>reporting</b> of data, and cultural barriers. This report reviews the current status of end-of-life care in Latin America, focusing on identifying existing deficiencies and providing a framework for improvement...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To assess {{inconsistencies}} in reported {{age at first}} sex (AFS) and age at first marriage (AFM) in three African cohorts, and consider their implications for interpreting trends in sexual and marital debut. METHODS: Data were analysed from population-based cohort studies in Zimbabwe, Uganda and South Africa with 3, 10 and 4 behavioural survey rounds, respectively. Three rounds over a similar time frame were selected from each site for comparative purposes. The consistency of AFS and AFM reports was assessed for each site by comparing responses made by participants in multiple surveys. Respondents were defined as unreliable if {{less than half of}} all their age-at-event reports were the same. Kaplan-Meier functions were used to describe the cumulative proportion (1) having had sex and (2) married by age, stratified by sex, birth cohort and site, to compare the influence of reporting inconsistencies on these estimates. RESULTS: Among participants attending all three comparable rounds, the percentage with <b>unreliable</b> AFS <b>reports</b> ranged from 30 % among South African women to 56 % among Zimbabwean men, with similar patterns observed for AFM. Inclusion of <b>unreliable</b> <b>reports</b> had little effect on estimates of median age-at-event in all sites. There was some evidence from the 1960 - 9 birth cohort that women in Uganda and both sexes in South Africa reported later AFS as they aged. CONCLUSION: Although reporting quality is unlikely to affect comparisons of AFS and AFM between settings, care should be taken not to overinterpret small changes in reported age-at-event over time within each site...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{success of}} the Global Polio Eradication Initiative was remarkable, but four {{countries}} - Afghanistan, Pakistan, India and Nigeria - never interrupted polio transmission. Pakistan reportedly achieved all milestones except interrupting virus transmission. This paper describes the perceptions of health workers and managers regarding constraints in the Polio Eradication Initiative (PEI) to ultimately provide evidence for designing future interventions. Methods A qualitative cross-sectional study using focus group discussions and in-depth interviews was conducted in the Nankana Sahib District of Pakistan's Punjab province. Study subjects included staff at all levels in the PEI at district headquarters, in all 4 tehsils (sub-districts) and at 20 randomly selected primary health centers. In total, 4 FGD and 7 interview sessions were conducted and individual session summary notes were prepared and later synthesized, consolidated and subjected to conceptual analysis. Results The main constraints identified {{in the study were}} the poor condition of the cold chain in all aspects, poor skills and a lack of authority in resource allocation and human resource management, limited advocacy and communication resources, a lack of skills and training among staff at all levels in the PEI/EPI in almost all aspects of the program, a deficiency of public health professionals, poor health services structure, administrative issues (including ineffective means of performance evaluation, bureaucratic and political influences, problems in vaccination areas and field programs, no birth records at health facilities, and poor linkage between different preventive programs), <b>unreliable</b> <b>reporting</b> and poor monitoring and supervision systems, limited use of local data for interventions, and unclear roles and responsibilities after decentralization. Conclusion The study highlights various shortcomings and bottlenecks in the PEI, and the barriers identified should be considered in prioritizing future strategies. </p...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{sought to}} develop an {{international}} consensus on the definition of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in the pediatric population. METHODS: Using the Delphi process, a set of statements was developed and voted on by an international panel of eight pediatric gastroenterologists. Statements were based on systematic literature searches using Medline, EMBASE, and CINAHL. Voting was conducted using a six-point scale, with consensus defined a priori as agreement in 75 % of the group. the strength of each statement was assessed using the GRADE system. RESULTS: There were four rounds of voting. in the final vote, consensus was reached on 98 % of the 59 statements. in this vote, 95 % of the statements were accepted by seven of eight voters. Consensus items of particular note are: (i) GERD is present when reflux of gastric contents causes troublesome symptoms and/or complications, but this definition is complicated by <b>unreliable</b> <b>reporting</b> of symptoms in {{children under the age}} of similar to years; (ii) histology has limited use in establishing or excluding a diagnosis of GERD; its primary role is to exclude other conditions; (iii) Barrett's esophagus should be defined as esophageal metaplasia that is intestinal metaplasia, positive or negative; and (iv) extraesophageal conditions may be associated with GERD, but for most of these conditions causality remains to be established. CONCLUSIONS: the consensus statements that comprise the Definition of GERD in the Pediatric Population were developed through a rigorous process. These statements are intended to be used for the development of future clinical practice guidelines and as a basis for clinical trials.

40|$|Background: New Zealand {{children}} are not meeting fruit and vegetable recommendations. Garden to Table, an in-school cooking and gardening programme, offers a potential solution. Objective: To evaluate the effects of Garden to Table participation {{for at least one}} school year on children’s fruit and vegetable consumption and variety of intake, their knowledge of and attitudes towards fruits, vegetables, cooking and gardening, and their cooking- and gardening-related self-efficacy and behaviours. Design: An epidemiological study comparing the amount and variety of fruit & vegetables consumed, and knowledge, attitudes and self-efficacy related to fruit & vegetables of two groups of children: 158 students aged nine to 11 {{who had been in the}} Garden to Table programme for at least one school year, and 128 students from control schools, matched for year level. Quantitative evaluation used adapted versions of the Ministry of Health’s 2002 National Children’s Nutrition Survey food frequency questionnaire and the children’s questionnaire used in the Stephanie Alexander Kitchen Garden evaluation. P< 0. 05 was used to indicate statistical significance. Outcomes: No significant difference was found in the proportion of children meeting recommended overall fruit & vegetable intake between Garden to Table (38. 8 %) and control groups (39. 8 %), p= 0. 29. However, when individual reported fruit & vegetable consumption was summed, fruit & vegetable intakes were significantly greater in the control group (P= 0. 02 for both), but ranged from zero to 16 and from zero to 39. 2 serves per day, respectively, indicating <b>unreliable</b> <b>reporting.</b> Significant gender and year-level interactions were present for vegetable & fruit variety, respectively, with boys in the Garden to Table group consuming 2. 93 (0. 18, 5. 69) more vegetables per week than boys in the control group (p= 0. 02), and year 5 control participants consuming 3. 43 (1. 59, 5. 27) more fruit per week than year 5 Garden to Table participants (p< 0. 01). The Garden to Table group had significantly greater scores for attitudes and knowledge. There were no significant differences in cooking- and gardening-related self-efficacy or behaviour scores. Conclusion: The Garden to Table programme improved children’s knowledge and attitudes about cooking, gardening, fruit & vegetables. However, further longitudinal research, using reliable assessment methods, within constraints of school settings is needed to evaluate consumption of fruit & vegetables...|$|E

The Army prepositions equipment at diverse strategic locations in order to field combat-ready forces in days rather than the weeks it would take if equipment had to be moved from the United States to the location of the conflict. The Army Prepositioned Stocks (APS) program supports the National Military Strategy and {{is an important part of}} the Department of Defense's (DOD) overall strategic mobility framework. The APS program depends on prepositioned unit sets of equipment and sustainment stocks to enable troops to deploy rapidly and train with prepositioned equipment before beginning combat operations. As we testified in January 2007 and March 2006, however, sustained continuing operations have taken a toll on the condition and readiness of military equipment, and the Army faces a number of ongoing and long-term challenges that will affect both the timing and cost of equipment repair and replacement, particularly to its prepositioned stocks. Over the past several years, GAO and other audit agencies have reported on numerous long-standing problems facing DOD's and the Army's prepositioning programs, including a lack of centralized operational direction; <b>unreliable</b> <b>reporting</b> on the maintenance condition of equipment; equipment excesses at some prepositioned locations; and systemic problems with requirements determination and inventory management. In September 2005, we recommended that DOD develop a coordinated departmentwide plan and joint doctrine for the department's prepositioning programs. In February 2007, we reported that while the Army expected to finalize its implementation plan for prepositioning stocks by December 31, 2006, DOD would not complete its departmentwide strategy before mid-April 2007. We recommended that the Secretary of Defense direct the Secretary of the Army to take steps to synchronize the Army's prepositioning strategy with the DOD-wide strategy, to ensure that future investments made for the Army's prepositioning program would align with the anticipated DOD-wide prepositioning strategy.

40|$|The Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) was {{specifically}} developed to assess {{signs and symptoms}} of major depression in patients with dementia. Because some of these patients may give <b>unreliable</b> <b>reports,</b> the CSDD uses a comprehensive interviewing approach that derives information from the patient and the informant. Information is elicited through two semi-structured interviews; an interview with an informant and an interview with the patient. Based on these interviews, the interviewer can score the CSDD by assigning a preliminary score to each item of the scale {{on the basis of the}} informant’s report in the “Informant ” column. The next step is for the rater to interview the patient using the Cornell scale items as a guide. The interviews focus on depressive symptoms and signs occurring during the week preceding the interview. Many of the items during the patient interview can be filled after direct observation of the patient. If there are discrepancies in ratings generated from the informant and the patient interviews, the rater should re-interview both the informant and the patient to resolve the discrepancies. The final ratings of the CSDD items represent the rater's clinical impression rather than the responses of the informant or the patient. The CSDD takes approximately 20 minutes to administer. Each item is rated for severity on a scale of 0 - 2 (0 =absent, 1 =mild or intermittent, 2 =severe). The item scores are added. Scores above 10 indicate a probable major depression. Scores above 18 indicate a definite major depression. Scores below 6 as a rule are associated with absence of significant depressive symptoms...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — A {{multi-purpose}} {{web service}} for risk management {{is presented in}} this paper. The approach suggested relies on user supplied data to set the model parameters. However, in real life, people are notoriously inaccurate and <b>unreliable</b> in <b>reporting</b> their preferences. This is especially true as the dimensionality {{and complexity of the}} problem increases.
