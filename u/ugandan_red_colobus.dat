50|$|The <b>Ugandan</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus tephrosceles) is an {{endangered}} species of red colobus monkey, recognised as a distinct species since 2001. There is disagreement however over taxonomy with many considering the <b>Ugandan</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> to be a subspecies (Procolobus rufomitratus tephrosceles). The <b>Ugandan</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> is an Old World monkey which is found in 5 different locations across Uganda and Tanzania.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Ugandan</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> has {{two main}} predators: the common {{chimpanzee}} and the crowned eagle. There are many primate species in Kibale National Park but chimpanzees rarely hunt any species {{other than the}} <b>Ugandan</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus.</b> Each year in Ngogo, part of Kibale National Park, up to 12% of the red colobus population is killed by chimpanzees. Chimpanzees do not hunt <b>Ugandan</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> all year round, instead they tend to go through bouts of heavy hunting. In response to attacks by a chimpanzee, all members of a <b>Ugandan</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> group gather together and males assemble to aggressively try and deter the attacking chimpanzee.|$|E
50|$|It is {{not certain}} why the <b>Ugandan</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> forms these {{associations}} with other species but protection from predators is the most accepted reason. The <b>Ugandan</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> is less vigilant, looking out for predators less often, when associated with the red-tailed monkey. It also forms these associations more readily when there are {{a large number of}} young in the <b>Ugandan</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> group which implies it may be more protected when with the other species.|$|E

It is endemic to {{riverine}} and montane forest in the Udzungwa Mountains in Tanzania. It is threatened by habitat loss.|$|R
50|$|The Zanzibar <b>red</b> <b>colobus,</b> Procolobus kirkii, {{population}} on Zanzibar, represents {{a population of}} <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> that {{is believed to have}} been isolated on the island after sea levels rose toward the end of the Pleistocene epoch. Furthermore, it is suggested through mitochondrial analysis, that phylogenetic groups within the <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> have been genetically isolated from another since the Pliocene.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Ugandan</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> is a folivore so {{the main}} {{component}} of its diet is leaves. It {{is not limited}} to any tree species in particular and different groups in the same forest have shown preferences for different tree species. Although not particularly fussy about which species of tree it eats, the <b>Ugandan</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> does have a preference for eating young leaves or the petioles of more mature leaves. Although uncommon the <b>Ugandan</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> has been observed eating bark, seeds and fruits, thought to be an important source of nutrients.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. In this 3 -year {{investigation}} we documented {{patterns of}} density, diet, and activity of <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys (Procolobus tephrosceles) in six areas {{in or near}} Kibale National Park, Uganda and related these patterns to availability of food resources. There were large differences in the density and behavior of the <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> among the sites. For example, the <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> at one site with a diverse plant community of more than 61 tree species, had a diet that included at least 42 species. In contrast, at a second site <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> spent 92 % of their feeding time eating from one species that dominated the tree community. The density of important <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> food trees varied among sites from 32 trees/ha to 204 trees/ha, and <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> density ranged from 0. 70 groups/km 2 to 7. 41 groups/km 2. Among sites, <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> density {{was related to the}} cumulative DBH of important food trees, when one apparently anom-alous site was excluded, and populations with more plant species in their diets tended to be those that were found at higher densities. Activity budgets of the <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> populations varied markedly among sites. For example, feeding time ranged among sites from 29 to 55 %, and traveling varied from 5 to 20 %. When faced with increased foraging demands, <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> reduced the time spent resting, while the time spent socializing remained fairly constant. Comparative socioecological studies typically contrast species epa-rated by large geographical distances to ensure there is sufficient variation in the environment to detect behavioral responses. The marked ifferences in ecological conditions and <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> behavior we docu-mented over short geographical distances, uggests that small-scale contrasts are a useful tool to examine ecological determinants of behavior and community structure...|$|R
50|$|Miss Waldron's <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Piliocolobus badius waldronae) is a {{subspecies}} of {{the western}} <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> native to West Africa. It has not been officially sighted since 1978 and was considered extinct in 2000. However, new evidence suggests that {{a very small number}} of these monkeys may be living in the southeast corner of CÃ´te d'Ivoire. The IUCN Red List notes Miss Waldron's <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> as critically endangered.|$|R
50|$|Pennant's colobus {{was first}} {{described}} in 1838 by George Robert Waterhouse, {{curator at the}} Zoological Society of London's museum, and was named in honour of the naturalist and traveller Thomas Pennant.Three subspecies of this <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> are traditionally recognized: The Bioko <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus pennantii pennantii), the Niger Delta <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus pennantii epieni) and Bouvier's <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus pennantii bouvieri). However, Groves (2007) raised P. p. epieni, and P. p. bouvieri to Piliocolobus epieni and Piliocolobus bouvieri, respectively (this nomenclature has been followed here). Ting agreed that preliminary genetic evidence supported elevating P. epieni at least.|$|R

50|$|Crowned eagles {{prefer to}} prey on infants and young juveniles of the <b>Ugandan</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus.</b> Research {{has found that}} both the <b>Ugandan</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> and the red-tailed monkey are killed less often by crowned eagles than would be expected, based on both monkeys' high {{abundance}} in the Kibale National Park. Both monkey species's avoidance of capture {{has been attributed to}} their increased defence from forming interspecific associations.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Ugandan</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> {{is often}} found in {{association}} with other species of primates. Groups in parts of Kibale National Park have been seen to be in association with red-tailed monkeys {{for more than half}} their time. Although polyspecific associations are most common with red-tailed monkeys, associations have occasionally been observed between the <b>Ugandan</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> and the gray-cheeked mangabey, the blue monkey and the mantled guereza.|$|E
5000|$|From {{the time}} it first became known to science (in 1993) until 2007 or 2008, it was {{considered}} a subspecies of the western <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus badius) and more recently Pennant's colobus (Procolobus pennantii), and its trinomial name was Procolobus badius epieni or Procolobus pennantii epieni. Colin Groves recognized the Niger Delta <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> as a full species in 2007, although Groves considered all the <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys, including the Niger Delta <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> {{to be in the}} genus Piliocolobus, rather than Procolobus (this nomenclature has been followed here). [...] However, other authors consider Piliocolobus to be a subgenus of Procolobus.|$|R
50|$|According to sources, Kirk first drew zoologists' {{attention}} to the Zanzibar <b>red</b> <b>colobus,</b> which is also commonly known as Kirk's <b>red</b> <b>colobus.</b> This species, Procolobus kirkii, which is endemic to Zanzibar, is named after him.|$|R
50|$|The western <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus badius), {{also known}} as the rust <b>red</b> <b>colobus,</b> is a species of Old World monkey found in West African forests from Senegal to Ghana. All other species of red colobuses have {{formerly}} been considered subspecies of P. badius. It is often hunted by the common chimpanzee. In 1994, western <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys infected many chimpanzees with Ebola virus when they were hunted and eaten by the chimpanzees.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Ugandan</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> is {{classified}} as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. It has this listing because the populations are very fragmented {{and there is no}} movement of individuals between populations. The species is also classified as Endangered because the occurrence of all the populations combined is less than 5,000 km2 and this area is at risk of being decreased due to habitat loss and degradation that occurs outside protected areas. The <b>Ugandan</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> is also listed as Endangered due to there being a decline in numbers, principally due to common chimpanzee predation and habitat loss. Hunting of the <b>Ugandan</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> by humans is not common and in Kibale, Uganda hunting of all primates was stopped in the 1960s.|$|E
50|$|The {{habitat of}} the <b>Ugandan</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> varies by population. Kibale National Park, Uganda, {{inhabited}} by the largest population, is a moist evergreen tropical forest. Kibale National Park {{has been a}} protected area since 1993. Before 1993 parts of the forest were subject to logging of different degrees of severity. The habitat of the <b>Ugandan</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> in the Mbisi Forest Reserve on the Ufipa Plateau is fragmented and severely degraded. Unlike Kibale where significant expanses of undisturbed forest remain.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Ugandan</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus,</b> {{like all}} colobus monkeys, has thumbs {{which are so}} reduced in size they are almost absent. It is thought this feature may help in brachiation when moving through the canopy.|$|E
50|$|The Tana River <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus rufomitratus), {{also called}} the eastern <b>red</b> <b>colobus,</b> is a highly {{endangered}} species of primate in the family Cercopithecidae. It is endemic to a narrow zone of gallery forest near the Tana River in southeastern Kenya.|$|R
40|$|Chimpanzees across Africa {{include some}} meat in their diet 1. In most {{communities}} where chimpanzees {{have been studied}} over the long term, primate prey is apparently preferred over other animal prey, with <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys (Piliocolobus badius) comprising the most common monkey species eaten 2. At Fongoli, Senegal, {{it is likely that}} chimpanzees have never had access to <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys at this hot, dry and open site, although the range of <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys (P. b. temminckii) in Senegal and adjacent countries in West Africa has diminished 3. Fongoli chimpanzees are currently not sympatric with <b>red</b> <b>colobus,</b> although they eat vertebrate prey of various types, including a number of primate species...|$|R
50|$|Another {{remarkable}} behavior {{occurs when}} <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys reach their restless and somewhat nomadic adolescence. This period {{is when the}} young monkeys leave their natal troops and look for another troop to join. This is not easy, as most troops are very suspicious and can get deadly when new monkeys try to join. The <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys have adapted their behavior by joining troops of green monkeys that are near the potential <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> troops that they wish to join, and living amongst {{them in order to}} spy on their potential new families. In one notable case, an adolescent male <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> spent two years with a green monkey troop in order to spy in safety on a prospective troop in this manner.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Ugandan</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> {{is found}} only in Africa. It has a {{distribution}} spanning 1000 km of East Africa but populations are only found in 5 separate forested areas. These areas are in west Tanzania {{at the edge of}} Lake Victoria, in Gombe and Mahale Mountains at the edge of Lake Tanganyika, on the Ufipa Plateau and in west Uganda in Kibale National Park. The Ugandan population is the largest and {{it has been suggested that}} this is the only viable population with around 17,000 individuals. It is possible, though yet to be verified, that the <b>Ugandan</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> might also be located in Rwanda, Burundi and the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.|$|E
50|$|Recognised as a {{distinct}} species in 2001 the <b>Ugandan</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> had previously been considered a subspecies of P. badius, and later a subspecies of P. foai. There is currently a debate {{as to whether it}} should be considered a subspecies of P. rufomitratus.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ugandan</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> {{groups are}} multi-male. Habitat quality and {{predation}} can affect group size which {{range in size}} from as few as 3 to as large as 85 individuals, although an average group size is around 40 individuals. The size of a group is often determined by how many males are present. Within a social group males are the stable component and rarely successfully move to another group. Females can disperse to other groups easily and are attracted to groups which contain a higher number of males. [...] In all social groups of <b>Ugandan</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> females out-number males. This natural imbalance is further exaggerated by the predatory action of common chimpanzees which single out females and juveniles as prey. Within groups there is a dominance hierarchy with adult males being dominant over adult females, most likely because of their larger size.|$|E
50|$|Thollon's <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus tholloni), {{also known}} as the Tshuapa <b>red</b> <b>colobus,</b> is a species of <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkey from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and lower Republic of the Congo. It is found south of Congo River and west of Lomami River. It had once been {{considered}} a subspecies of the P. badius. It was recognised as a distinct species by Dandelot in 1974, and this was followed by Groves in 2001, while others have suggested it should be considered a subspecies of P. rufomitratus.|$|R

50|$|Fruit, {{seeds and}} foliage provide the primary food source of Miss Waldron's <b>red</b> <b>colobus.</b> The western <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> {{frequently}} is hunted and eaten by larger carnivores, including common chimpanzees (specifically western chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes verus, {{in the range}} of P. b. waldronae), leopards, pythons, eagles and humans.|$|R
50|$|Sexual {{maturity}} {{in males}} is reached at 5 years and between 4 and 5 years for females of the <b>Ugandan</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus.</b> The Gestation period is 5 to 6 months with females having their first infant between 4 and 5 years old. There is no distinct breeding season with infants being born all year round, however during the rainier months a peak in births {{is seen to}} coincide with the flush of new leaves for food.|$|E
5000|$|The {{taxonomy}} {{is potentially}} confusing. Procolobus foai has, together {{with all other}} red colobuses, been considered a subspecies of Procolobus badius. When considered a separate species, the scientific name Procolobus oustaleti (Trouessart, 1906) {{has been used for}} the Central African Red Colobus, but this is incorrect, as the taxon foai precedes oustaleti by 7 years. Additionally, the taxon tephrosceles has been considered a subspecies of the Central African red colobus, but following Groves (2001) it is here recognized as a separate species, the <b>Ugandan</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus.</b> Alternatively, {{it has been suggested that}} the Central African red colobus should be considered a subspecies of P. rufomitratus. As here defined, the Central African red colobus has 5 subspecies, although these are variable and hard to separate: ...|$|E
50|$|There are 13 {{species of}} {{primates}} in Kibale National Park. The park protects several well-studied habituated communities of common chimpanzee, {{as well as}} several species of Central African monkey including the Uganda mangabey (Lophocebus ugandae), the <b>Ugandan</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus tephrosceles) and the L'Hoest's monkey. Other primates that are found in the park include the black-and-white colobus (Colobus guereza) and the blue monkey (Cercopithecus mitis). The park's population of elephants travels between the park and Queen Elizabeth National Park. Other terrestrial mammals that are found within Kibale National Park include red and blue duikers, bushbucks, sitatungas, bushpigs, giant forest hogs, common warthogs, and African buffalo. The carnivores that are present include leopards, African golden cats, servals, different mongooses and two species of otter. In addition, lions visit the park on occasion.|$|E
