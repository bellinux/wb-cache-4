40|$|The {{benefits}} of intensive farming {{of the giant}} tiger prawn Penaeus monodon in the Philippines are discussed {{in relation to the}} environmental costs. Ecological effects include mangrove conversion into ponds; use of antibiotics and chemicals leading to drug resistance; dumping of pond effluents which affect neighboring ecosystems; and pumping of groundwater that causes saltwater intrusion and vulnerability to floods. In addition, these effects lead to social costs in the form of reduction in domestic and agricultural water supplies; decreases in the production of foodfish and other food crops; further marginalization of coastal fishermen; displacement of labor; and credit monopoly by big businessmen. Comparative economic analyses of three prawn-farming systems showed that, compared to extensive and intensive culture, semi-intensive farms give the best performance using <b>undiscounted</b> (<b>payback</b> <b>period,</b> return on investment) and discounted (net present value, internal rate of return) economic indicators. With a 20 % fluctuation in inputs or selling price intensive farming will no longer be profitable because of the high variable cost. The paper concludes with recommendations for strict enforcement of existing government guidelines (e. g. ban on mangrove conversion); institution of new policies on the use of groundwater, seawater and public credit; diversification of cultured species; and emphasis on semi-intensive farming parallel with brakes on further intensification of prawn farming...|$|E

5000|$|The {{time value}} {{of money is}} not taken into account. <b>Payback</b> <b>period</b> {{intuitively}} measures how long something takes to [...] "pay for itself." [...] All else being equal, shorter <b>payback</b> <b>periods</b> are preferable to longer <b>payback</b> <b>periods.</b> <b>Payback</b> <b>period</b> is popular due to its ease of use despite the recognized limitations described below. The term is also widely used in other types of investment areas, often with respect to energy efficiency technologies, maintenance, upgrades, or other changes. For example, a compact fluorescent light bulb may be described as having a <b>payback</b> <b>period</b> of {{a certain number of}} years or operating hours, assuming certain costs. Here, the return to the investment consists of reduced operating costs. Although primarily a financial term, the concept of a <b>payback</b> <b>period</b> is occasionally extended to other uses, such as energy <b>payback</b> <b>period</b> (the period of time over which the energy savings of a project equal the amount of energy expended since project inception); these other terms may not be standardized or widely used.|$|R
5000|$|The {{discounted}} <b>payback</b> <b>period</b> is {{the amount}} of time that it takes to cover the cost of a project, by adding positive discounted cash flow coming from the profits of the project.

50|$|When {{using the}} {{discounted}} <b>payback</b> <b>period</b> for decision making, a firm must first determine a discount {{rate at which}} to discount the future cash flow values of a specified period of time.

After that you follow the same procedure you would to calculating the <b>payback</b> <b>period.</b> The discounted <b>payback</b> <b>period</b> should be in terms of years. If the discounted <b>payback</b> <b>period</b> {{is less than the}} predetermined period of time then the decision rule is to accept the project. On the other hand, if the discounted <b>payback</b> <b>period</b> is greater than the predetermined period then the decision rule would be to reject the project.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a new analytical probabilistic model that can characterize the energy recovery and economic <b>payback</b> <b>period</b> of in-line micro turbines in water distribution applications. The analytical probabilistic model incorporates elements of derived probability distribution theory. A {{probability distribution function}} for the power produced by the turbine is first derived assuming that the power produced by the turbine is functionally dependent on the flow rate through the turbine. A probability distribution function for the <b>payback</b> <b>period</b> of the turbine is also derived assuming that the <b>payback</b> <b>period</b> is both functionally dependent and inversely proportional to the power produced. The analytical probabilistic model was applied to a water distribution network to evaluate the expected values and standard deviation of <b>payback</b> <b>period.</b> The case study {{was used to examine}} the impact of the coefficient of variation of turbine flow, initial capital cost of the turbine, and electricity price on the expected value and standard deviation of <b>payback</b> <b>period</b> for an optimized turbine location. The results suggested that the coefficient of variation of turbine flow had little impact on the expected value and standard deviation of <b>payback</b> <b>period.</b> The initial capital cost and electricity price {{had a significant impact on}} the expected value of <b>payback</b> <b>period</b> but only a small impact on the standard deviation of <b>payback</b> <b>period.</b> The results will help municipalities better understand how the uncertainties associated with demand, initial capital costs, and electricity pricing will affect the economic viability of in-line micro-turbine projects in their systems...|$|R

Net metering {{is the most common}} state policy approach (enacted by 46 states), but various states have also enacted other incentives and different approaches to net metering. Investments with faster <b>payback</b> <b>periods</b> are more attractive to investors. In this study we analyze five different state approaches at various projected electricity cost escalation rates with respect to the <b>payback</b> <b>periods</b> for a 5 -kilowatt (kW) DG. We also weigh the potential impact that proposed United State Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations to 111 (d) of the Clean Air Act may have on <b>payback</b> <b>periods.</b> Using the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s (NREL) System Advisor Model (SAM), we compared the <b>payback</b> <b>periods</b> and net present value of investments (NPV) in each of the respective states over a thirty-year period. When holding other variables constant, including the 30 % renewable energy federal tax credit, we find a range of <b>payback</b> <b>periods</b> and NPVs affected significantly by state policies and incentives. To a lesser extent we find that cost escalation rates have an inverse relationship with <b>payback</b> <b>periods,</b> and the proposed EPA 111 (d) regulations have little to no effect on <b>payback</b> <b>periods...</b>|$|R

40|$|The article {{describes}} the implementation of storage heaters. The main of topic is the evaluation of <b>payback</b> <b>period</b> of heating systems which use storage heaters. These systems are compared to district heating systems, gas heating systems and direct electric heating systems. The cost of all systems is taken as for Kyiv, Ukraine. The analysis shows that at the current price level the implementation of storage heaters (storage electric heating) is the best option for residential dwellings which use district heating and for other consumers which use direct electric heating. It leads to the greatest reduction of operating costs and thus reducing <b>payback</b> <b>periods.</b> So only these cases are used to evaluate possible <b>payback</b> <b>period.</b> It is important {{to mention that the}} smallest reduction in operating costs for both types of consumers are both in the case of replacing gas heating systems with storage heaters. In order to determine the <b>payback</b> <b>period,</b> it is calculated energy consumption per 1 kW of installed capacity of a storage heater and unit cost per 1 kW of installed capacity. Both manufactured in Ukraine and abroad storage heaters are presented in this article and their costs per 1 kW of installed capacity are analysed and compared. The <b>payback</b> <b>period</b> is analysed both for conditions of a simple calculation and for options when the discount rate is taking into account. Thus, the discount rate E varied from 0 to 22 %. The calculations, made in this article, show that the cost of a storage heater varies considerably, and under simple calculation (E = 0 %) and the minimum cost of a storage heater <b>payback</b> <b>period</b> may be 3 [...] . 5 years, and with higher value of discount rate E and the use of a more expensive storage heater, the <b>payback</b> <b>period</b> can exceed <b>payback</b> <b>period</b> of 20 years. ?????? ????????? ????????? ?????????????????????????? ?????????????, ? ?????? ??????????? ?????? ?? ??????????? ?? ????????? ? ??????????????? ?????????? ?????? ?????????. ? ?????????? ???????????? ? ?????? ??????? ????????, ??? ? ?????? ????????? ???? ???????? ???????? ???????? ??? ??????? ???????????? ?????? ????? ?? ?????? ??????? ?????????????? ?????????, ? ??? ????????? - ?? ?????? ???????????? ?????????. ???? ??????????? ??? ??????????????? ??? ??? ??????? ???????? ???????, ??? ? ??? ??????? ??????? ?????? ???????????????...|$|R

40|$|Photovoltaic {{systems are}} {{renewable}} energy sources with various applications and their implementations in energy production and saving are verified. Installing those systems onto merchant marine vessels {{could prove to be}} an efficient way of minimizing fuel costs and simultaneously protecting the environment by reducing significant carbon dioxide emissions. This paper examines the feasibility of installing solar panels onto vessels and also calculated the <b>payback</b> <b>period</b> from the adopted investment with respect to fuel oil savings. Thus, the two important parameters incorporated in the parametric analysis are the solar radiation density and the fuel cost. In order to calculate the energy production of the solar installation systems, the globe is divided in six different zones, according to solar radiation density (Stackhouse and Whitlock, 2008). For one square meter of the considered solar panels the peak output power is taken equal to 130 W (Kagaraki, 2001). The <b>payback</b> <b>period</b> of the investment depends greatly on the fuel prices. For a reasonable fuel price annual increase at about 10 - 15 % the estimated <b>payback</b> <b>period</b> varies from 16 to 27 years. The more the fuel oil increases, the methodology reveals that the <b>payback</b> <b>period</b> converges to a minimum of 10 years. When using any storage media such as hydrogen, the methodology shows that the <b>payback</b> <b>period</b> increases and this depends on the proportion of the energy stored and from the storage media itself.
