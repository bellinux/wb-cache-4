40|$|The {{widespread}} {{deployment of}} base stations constitutes a promising solution {{to cope with}} the ever-increasing wireless data rate demands. However, it also increases the interference levels, especially at the cell-edge. Most interference management techniques assume coordination between base stations, which involves undesired overhead and delays. To solve this problem, we propose a neighbor-friendly autonomous algorithm for power control in wireless heterogeneous networks that protects victim users from neighboring cells through a penalty factor in the power allocation level. We refer to this algorithm as neighbor-friendly iterative waterfilling (NF-IWF). In addition, we propose a low-complexity closed-form version that fixes the penalty factor by assuming a linear approximation of the victim <b>user</b> <b>data</b> <b>rate.</b> In high interference conditions, it can achieve a victim <b>user</b> <b>data</b> <b>rate</b> increase by a factor of 3. 5 compared to IWF, 15 compared to soft frequency reuse (SFR), and 60 compared to equal power allocation (EPA) with a marginal decrease of the primary <b>user</b> <b>data</b> <b>rate...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{multiple}} access channels are considered in which <b>user</b> <b>data</b> <b>rates</b> increase with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To account for channel estimation errors, a finite-SNR diversity-multiplexing tradeoff framework is formulated. The multiplexing gain is defined for each user as {{the ratio of}} the <b>user’s</b> <b>data</b> <b>rate</b> to the capacity of an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. For a set of user multiplexing gains, a finite-SNR diversity gain is defined by the slope of the common outage probability as a function of SNR for quasi-static fading. These definitions have been used in previous work to characterize a finite-SNR diversity-multiplexing tradeoff in {{multiple access}} channels and point-to-point multiantenna channels. Inner and outer bounds on the feasible rate region of a multiple access channel with channel estimation errors are used to obtain estimates of the common outage probability. The outage probability is then used to estimate the diversity gain as a function of user multiplexing gains and SNR. It is shown that a finite-SNR formulation is essential to characterizing the impact of channel estimation errors on the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff. I...|$|R
