Based on real cases, the sales elasticity curve is analyzed and a quantitative model is developed. In the domain of unit price - sales, the "Value Hysteresis" phenomenon is identified and defined. Non-linear dependence is identified as well, specific to the <b>unbalanced</b> <b>markets</b> (as far as supply-demand ratio) and extreme values of the elasticity coefficient are presented (such as E = 0 and E → - 8). Negative consequences of "automatic" marketing decisions based only on theoretical models are underlined - as their impact on clients' satisfaction and firm's profitability. Among the most important conclusions of the paper are: the key role of marketing information and research; importance of consumer loyalty; the growing role of the professional consulting services in management, mostly in tourism and hospitality industry from emerging economies...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a new class of}} matching problems that mimics the tuition exchange programs employed by colleges in the US to enable the dependents of their eligible faculty to use their tuition benefits at other participating institutions. Each participating college has to maintain a balance between exported and imported students; a negative balance with exports exceeding imports is generally penalized by suspension from the program. On the other hand, these programs function through decentralized markets that make it difficult to sustain a balance. We show that any <b>unbalanced</b> <b>market</b> equilibrium respecting stability causes a race to the bottom by discouraging negative–balance colleges from exchange. To correct this failure, we propose a new centralized mechanism, two–sided top trading cycles (2 S-TTC), a variant of the well–known TTC mechanism. This is the first time a one–sided matching mechanism has been modified for a two–sided market. This mechanism selects a balanced–efficient matching that cannot be manipulated by students and it respects internal priority bylaws of colleges regarding dependent eligibility. Moreover, it makes full participation a dominant strategy for colleges, thus encouraging exchange. We also show that 2 S-TTC is the unique optimal mechanism fulfilling these objectives. There also exist tuition co-ops where maintaining a one–to–one balance is not the first objective. For these programs, to minimize imbalance while respecting stability, we also propose a new flexible mechanism with desirable properties...|$|E

This tech-nology oers useful new functionalities as the possibility to verify the integrity of a platform (attestation) or binding quantities on a specic platform (sealing). In this paper, we point out the deciencies of the attestation and sealing functionalities proposed by the existing speci-cation of the TCG: we show that these mechanisms can be misused to discriminate certain platforms, i. e., their operat-ing systems and consequently the corresponding vendors. A particular problem {{in this context is}} that of managing the multitude of possible congurations.

Clearly, the consequences caused by these problems lead to an unsatisfactory situation both for the private and business branch, and to an <b>unbalanced</b> <b>market</b> when such platforms are in wide use. To overcome these problems generally, we propose a com-pletely new approach: the attestation of a platform should not depend on the specic software or/and hardware (cong-uration) as it is today's practice but only on the " that the platform oers. Thus, a property-based attestation should only verify whether these properties are sucient to ful ll certain (security) requirements of the party who asks for attestation.

Having carried out a comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis of the <b>unbalanced</b> <b>market</b> and of the producer's market as the main barriers for harmonious and dynamic socio-economical development of the country, the author justifies the thesis that {{the causes of the}} existence of those obstacles should not be sought only in hitherto applied systems of managing the economy, since those barriers existed both before the introduction of the economic reform as well as during its functioning. Further parts of the article are concerned with the sources of the lack of the economical balance of the country, both dependent and independent of the economic reform. Much attention has been devoted to the problems of the areas into which the reform has been introduced and of those which remain beyond its reach. Taking the contribution of the State budget to the national income, its section-branch structure and the directions of distribution as the measures delimiting those areas, the author states that in order to redress the market balance the economic reform should be introduced also to other areas and that most of the present budgetary units should be subordinated to the direct production sphere. It means that the incomes of such units must be placed in the phase of the primary distribution of the national income {{to a greater extent than}} it has been so far.

Thirdly, the eastern coastal provinces are more sensitive in their responses to the changes of monetary stances than the other non-coastal central and western provinces.

They need to be properly addressed and solved. Price problem [...] -simply put, housing price is too high [...] - is one of them, and this paper is focused on it. Three basic questions are posed, i. e. (1) how to judge the housing affordability? (2) why the housing price is so high? (3) how to solve the housing price problem. The paper pays particular attention to answering the second question. Except the numerous news reports and surveys show that most of the ordinary city dwellers complained about the high housing price, the mathematical means, the four ratios, are applied to judge the housing affordability in Shanghai and Shenzhen. The results are very clear that the price problem is severe. So why? Something is wrong with the price mechanism. This research shows that mainly these five factors contribute to the price problem: the housing reform, the housing development model, the <b>unbalanced</b> housing <b>market,</b> the housing project financing and the poor governmental management. Finally the paper puts forward five suggestions to solve the housing price problem in first-hand private Chinese housing market.

40|$|The {{subject-matter}} of {{the article}} {{is an attempt to}} evaluate basic legal solutions of the Act of January 28, 1987 on counteracting monopolistic practices (Dz. U. nr 3, sec. 18). This act, unprecedented in the Polish legislation, is part of the economic reform. Polish economy is characterized by a high degree of concentration of production and monopolization of the market. With the increase of legal and economic independence of socialized enterprises more widespread became the tendency to take advantage of priviledged market position and to apply different monopolistic practices infringing the social interest and the interests of other producers and consumers. Such negative phenomena are a serious threat for the present economic reform. Therefore they need to be neutralized by the state through its broad and complex antimonopoly policy. One of the elements of that policy is the Act of 1987. The Act does not fight monopolies understood as organizational structures. The existence of monopolies is neither forbidden by law nor it is subject to legal sanctions. The Act, however, fights the most deterimental external aspects of monopolies, i. e. specific practices and monopolistic agreements. It is the basic purpose of the Act. Another important aim of the Act is protecting competition. The Act encompasses wide subjective and objective range. It is concerned with virtually all economic activity conducted by all legal and natural persons irrespective of the form of property, size or the degree of monopolizing the market since in conditions of an <b>unbalanced</b> <b>market</b> any producer, big or small, may behave or behaves like a true monopolist. The author presents the catalogue of monopolistic practices and agreements forbidden by the Act (Art. 8, 9, 11, 13, 14). He formulates several reservations and doubts concerning the narrow range of forbidden practices and the liberal attitude of the legislator towards the perpetrators of such practices. In particular, he criticizes the solution according to which monopolistic practices and agreements forbidden by the Act are not absolutely invalid (ex lege) but are subject to invalidation by an antimonopoly organ. In the final part {{of the article}} the author discusses the tasks and competences of an antimonopoly organ with respect to counteracting monopolistic practices and shaping the antimonopoly policy (Art. 4, 5). The author critically evaluates the placement of an antimonopoly organ as an administrative organ in the structure of State. In the author's opinion, vesting in the Minister of Finance additional functions of an antimonopoly organ is not the best solution. Rather, a special Antimonopoly Office subordinated directly to the Sejm or the Council of State should have been created.

It uses the concept ‘hotspot’ defined as places with rising house prices and in-migration of households with {{higher than average}} education and income. The focus rests on three places having the ideal characteristics of being a rural hotspot, located in three Swedish northern municipalities. These places are explored through ten interviews with ‘footloose’ households. The aim is to explore factors that shape rural housing market hotspots using stories from hotspot population households. The first reason for {{this study is that}} regional planning requests understanding to develop different regions and places for the future. Here the origins of hotspots are explored to understand the spread and sustainability of such developments. Second, housing markets in the countryside are more scantily investigated than in urban areas. In the <b>unbalanced</b> housing <b>market</b> with higher prices and limited supply in the urban areas hotspots in rural areas are not following traditional housing market theories, they are rather anomalies. Interviews with a specific footloose group of recent hotspot in-migrants are used in combination with knowledge about the housing market. Results show that although hotspots are locations with beautiful nature most households moved there because of finding jobs. The three areas have the ‘extra’ nature values and high status required for being a hotspot and a location for commuting to larger labor markets. The ‘footloose’ non-return migrants did find nice, cheaper housing that made them chose the area despite being strangers to the place. I suggest hotspots are the rare combination of footloose migrants and special places which make them difficult to develop elsewhere. På jakt efter hotspots.

Therefore, {{it is important for the}} construction industry to improve its company performance, either private or state-owned, in order to become competitive with foreign construction companies.

Several factors that affect and determine the success of a construction company are internal factors, external factors and market forces. Market forces are factors which are uncontrolled by the industrialists, therefore early anticipation is needed. Several problems that occurred in the market forces area in the construction industry are customer satisfaction rate, competition between companies, constraints in capturing <b>market,</b> <b>unbalanced</b> supply and demand, lack of innovation and inaccurate market segmentation. The research objective discussed in this paper is to identify the cause of the problems arise in a construction company’s market forces that influence the company’s performance in Indonesia.

Such subjects are widely debated during European summits, symbolizing an unsettled tension between droit sociale and market economies. Accordingly, they are highly controversial and multi-faceted. This thesis focus on two main aspects of the above-mentioned subjects, a dynamic one (circulation and access to social services) and a static one (competition and derogation regime for the operation of services of general economic interest, pursuant to Article 106. 2 TFEU).

This research assumes that ineffective Saudization in the private sector is not the core problem of the employment process in Saudi Arabia. In fact it is the outcome of the government’s heavy and unnecessary involvement and control over skill formation systems in the Kingdom especially over the General Organization for Technical Education and Vocational Training (GOTEVT) which is the main skill formation provider for the private labour market This involvement imposes the government’s rigid bureaucracy and limited funding on a very dynamic, flexible and self-sufficient economy like the private market in Saudi Arabia that is operating in a very competitive and changeable environment. Investigation of such argument against empirical findings from interviews with a number of government, quasigovernment and private sector managers supports such conclusion. It even illustrates that government involvement and bureaucratization is hindering the implementation of Saudization strategy itself in private organizations. Recommendations are made about changing the role of GOTEVT to create industry-led training organizations to serve and link the outcomes of this skill formation organization to the employment needs of the labour market and to the needs of the economy in general.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of the Polish economic reform occurs in the extremely unfavorable market conditions. The internal market is not only unbalanced but also dominated by monopolistic structures. The <b>unbalanced</b> and closed <b>market</b> becomes a source of the strong market power of those enterprises which supply determined goods and services. The present article is the author's attempt at theoretical explication of the essence of economic power of producers and {{the discussion of the}} characteristic features of that notion against the background of the general theory of power. In {{the first part of the}} article the author reviews definitions of the general notion of power encountered by him in the modern Western and socialist sociological, politological and legal literature. The definitions are of a certain value as they can facilitate understanding the essence and recognition of the action mechanisms of that specific sort of power, being the economic power of the socialized producers. The second part of the article brings about the author's discussion of the essence of the economic power of producers in the socialized economy. The authors shares opinions of those Polish economists, according to whom the notion of economic power can be referred to situations at which an enterprise gains a considerable market advantage, over other subjects, what allows it to shape regulational horizontal links according to the own rules of a game (independently from the official findings) as well as exercise influence over regulational vertical links (with the administrative center) to reach its own goals, contradicting the social goals and the goals of other market subjects. Next the author discusses the most important features of the economic power of the producers. The analysis produced in this respect resulted in formulating the following conclusions: — the economic power of the producers is a social relation; — the relation is not grounded in the legal regulation, it is effected by the factual position of a given enterprise on the market; — the economic power reveals an authoritarian character, power relations are this asymmetrical (there are dominating and dominated subjects in them); — the obedience is a substantial element of the economic power, the excèssiveness and range of power can be proved by a number of acts of the obedience and by a number of subjects manifesting it; — economic organizations as users of power are vested with a peculiar extra- -legal imperium, having the means of economic duress at their disposal; — two types of economic power are to be distinguished: the potential power and the power excercised; as the power being a certain potential, chance or possibility may, but does not have to be realized; — the economic power of the producers is neither forced nor absolute; there are possibilities to control it, limit it or eliminate it; — the economic power is transitive and relative as an enterprise is related to specific elements of its milieu both by means of dominance and subjection.
