5|$|Frank was {{introduced}} to Lucille Selig shortly after he arrived in Atlanta. She came from a prominent, <b>upper-middle</b> <b>class</b> Jewish family of industrialists who, two generations earlier, had founded the first synagogue in Atlanta. Though she was less devout in her Jewish faith than Frank, they married in November 1910. Frank described his married life as happy.|$|E
5|$|He {{came from}} an <b>upper-middle</b> <b>class</b> English background, and studied at Winchester College and the University of Oxford. After graduating, he was {{employed}} as an assistant schoolmaster at a boarding school and pursued a parallel career in the law, qualifying as a barrister in 1885. His main interest outside work was cricket, which he played with many leading players of the time, including Lord Harris and Francis Lacey.|$|E
5|$|Traditional pastimes {{and forms}} of {{recreation}} in rural areas were cock-fighting, bull-fighting, village fairs and plays. Men in urban areas indulged in social and communistic activities at recreational clubs, music concerts or sabhas, dramas and welfare organisations. Carnatic music and bharatanatyam were especially patronised by the upper and <b>upper-middle</b> <b>class</b> Madras society. Of the sports introduced by the British in the presidency, cricket, tennis, football and hockey were the most popular. An annual cricket tournament, known as the Madras Presidency Matches, was held between Indians and Europeans during Pongal.|$|E

50|$|Cordner's {{ministry}} {{was successful}} and popular, {{especially among the}} <b>upper-middle</b> <b>classes</b> and the business elite. He wrote and edited several magazines. In sermons and speeches, he championed progressive issues; world peace, woman's rights, anti-slavery in the US among others. He was succeeded by William Sullivan Barnes.|$|R
5|$|Sociological {{investigation}} {{indicates that}} certain {{sectors of society}} {{are more likely to}} engage in New Age practices than others. The majority of participants are from the middle and <b>upper-middle</b> <b>classes</b> of Western society. Sutcliffe noted that although most influential New Age figureheads were male, approximately two-thirds of its participants were female.|$|R
5|$|Lilian Faithfull {{was born}} in Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, in 1865. Her father, Francis Faithfull, was a clerk at the Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors. Her mother, Edith Lloyd, stayed home with eight {{children}} while also writing a History of England and magazine articles. Lilian was the second youngest of the six girls and two boys. She lived in an <b>upper-middle</b> <b>class</b> country house in Hertfordshire and was educated at The Grange in Hoddesdon (the only girl at the time), and later at home by her mother and governesses. Emily Faithfull, an early women's rights activist, was her cousin. Both of Faithfull's parents were opinionated about issues such as femininity and social class, but were not radicals.|$|E
5|$|Portrait of Monsieur Bertin is an 1832 oil-on-canvas {{painting}} by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. It depicts Louis-François Bertin (1766–1841), the French writer, art collector {{and director of}} the pro-royalist Journal des débats. Ingres completed the portrait during his first period of success; having achieved acclaim as a history painter, he accepted portrait commissions with reluctance, regarding them as a distraction from more important work. Bertin was a friend and a politically active member of the French <b>upper-middle</b> <b>class.</b> Ingres presents him as a personification of the commercially minded leaders of the liberal reign of Louis Philippe I. He is physically imposing and self-assured, but his real-life personality shines through– warm, wry and engaging to those who had earned his trust.|$|E
5|$|Byrd {{resigned}} from the presidency in January 1954 to embark upon an unsuccessful campaign for Governor of Maryland. He narrowly beat perennial candidate George P. Mahoney in the Democratic primary by 50.64% to 49.37% and faced Republican incumbent McKeldin in the general election. Byrd campaigned on his stance of separate but equal. McKeldin won comfortable majorities in Baltimore's black, Jewish, and <b>upper-middle</b> <b>class</b> white districts, while Byrd took all of the blue-collar white South and East Baltimore neighborhoods, including McKeldin's boyhood home along Eutaw Street. Elsewhere in the state, however, middle-class white voters did not support Byrd. Byrd lost by 54.46% to 45.54%. He went on to make unsuccessful bids for the Democratic nominations to the U.S. Senate in 1964 and the U.S. Congress in 1966.|$|E
50|$|Countries in Latin America {{with high}} rates of poverty, whose governments {{maintain}} and support unpopular privatizations and more orthodox economic policies that don't deliver general societal gains, are under pressure from populist politicians and movements accusing them of benefiting the upper and <b>upper-middle</b> <b>classes</b> and of being allied to foreign and business interests.|$|R
5000|$|Associated American Artists was an {{art gallery}} in New York City that was {{established}} in 1934 and ceased operation in 2000. [...] The gallery marketed art to the middle and <b>upper-middle</b> <b>classes,</b> first {{in the form of}} affordable prints and later in home furnishings and accessories, and {{played a significant role in}} the growth of art as an industry.|$|R
50|$|There is no {{reliable}} {{information about the}} magazine's readership, but the publisher's concept and price suggest that it circulated among women of the middle and <b>upper-middle</b> <b>classes.</b> A single issue of the journal, which by 1939 had reached a circulation of 32,870, cost 1.50 Reichmarks in the 1920s, ten times {{the cost of a}} copy of the popular daily newspaper Berliner Tageblatt.|$|R
5|$|Árbenz's role {{as defense}} {{minister}} {{had already made}} him a strong candidate for the presidency, and his firm support of the government during the 1949 uprising further increased his prestige. In 1950, the economically moderate Partido de Integridad Nacional (PIN) announced that Árbenz would be its presidential candidate in the upcoming election. This announcement was quickly followed by endorsements from most parties on the left, including the influential PAR, {{as well as from}} labor unions. Árbenz had only a couple of significant challengers in the election, in a field of ten candidates. One of these was Jorge García Granados, who was supported by some members of the <b>upper-middle</b> <b>class</b> who felt the revolution had gone too far. Another was Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes, who had been a general under Ubico, and who had the support of the hardline opponents of the revolution. During his campaign, Árbenz promised to continue and expand the reforms begun under Arévalo. The election was held on 15 November 1950, and Árbenz won more than 60% of the vote, in elections that were free and fair {{with the exception of the}} disenfranchisement of illiterate female voters. Árbenz was inaugurated as president on 15 March 1951.|$|E
5|$|Tiberius' brother Gaius {{was elected}} Plebeian Tribune in 123 BC. Gaius Gracchus' {{ultimate}} {{goal was to}} weaken the senate and to strengthen the democratic forces, so he first enacted a law which put the knights (equites, or <b>upper-middle</b> <b>class</b> citizens) on the jury courts instead of the senators. He then passed a grain law which greatly disadvantaged the provincial governors, {{most of whom were}} senators. The knights, on the other hand, stood to profit greatly from these grain reforms, and so the result was that Gaius managed to turn the most powerful class of non-senators against the senate. In the past, the senate eliminated political rivals either by establishing special judicial commissions or by passing a senatus consultum ultimum ("ultimate decree of the senate). Both devices allowed the senate to bypass the ordinary due process rights that all citizens had. Gaius outlawed the judicial commissions, and declared the senatus consultum ultimum to be unconstitutional. Gaius then proposed a law which granted citizenship rights to Rome's Italian allies, but the selfish democracy in Rome, which jealously guarded its privileged status, deserted him over this proposal. He stood for reelection to a third term in 121 BC, but was defeated and then murdered. The democracy, however, had finally realized how weak the senate had become.|$|E

50|$|The Public Schools Act 1868 {{was enacted}} by the British Parliament to reform and {{regulate}} seven of the leading English boys' schools of the time, most of which had grown out of ancient charity schools {{for the education of}} a certain number of poor scholars, but were then, as they do today, also educating many sons of the English upper and <b>upper-middle</b> <b>classes</b> on a fee-paying basis.|$|R
2500|$|In the {{transitional}} period of record-keeping, records tend to exist for the wealthy and <b>upper-middle</b> <b>classes,</b> but are often spotty and nonexistent for the middle classes and the poor. In the United States, birth registration did not begin in Mississippi until 1912 and was not universal until 1933. Hence, in many longevity cases, no actual birth record exists. This type of case is classified by gerontologists as [...] "partially validated".|$|R
50|$|The moyenne bourgeoisie {{or middle}} bourgeoisie {{contains}} {{people who have}} solid incomes and assets, but not the aura {{of those who have}} become established at a higher level. They tend to belong to a family that has been bourgeois for three or more generations. Some members of this class may have relatives from similar backgrounds, or may even have aristocratic connections. The moyenne bourgeoisie is the equivalent of the British and American <b>upper-middle</b> <b>classes.</b>|$|R

25|$|Compared {{with other}} {{contemporary}} neighborhoods, such as Palmer Woods and the Grosse Pointes, Rosedale Park has more modest house and lot sizes reflecting the solidly middle- and <b>upper-middle</b> <b>class</b> {{status of the}} original homeowners. Many of these original homeowners were professionals, such as doctors and dentists, and accountants, or had white-collar jobs in the booming automobile industry.|$|E
40|$|Premarital {{agreements}} are playing {{an increasingly important}} role in the American marriage ritual. Such contracts are no longer the exclusive domain of the rich or the famous; they are frequently made by prospective spouses of the middle- and <b>upper-middle</b> <b>classes.</b> In light of the increasing significance of premarital agreements, the legal rules that govern their enforceability are of great concern not only to lawmakers and legal scholars, but to the individuals whose economic futures may depend on these agreements...|$|R
50|$|The {{issue of}} gender {{representation}} on corporate {{boards of directors}} {{has been the subject}} of much criticism in recent years. Governments and corporations have responded with measures such as legislation mandating gender quotas and comply or explain systems to address the disproportionality of gender representation on corporate boards. A study of the French corporate elite has found that certain social classes are also disproportionately represented on boards, with those from the upper and, especially, <b>upper-middle</b> <b>classes</b> tending to dominate.|$|R
5000|$|In the Third World, NRMs {{most often}} {{appeal to the}} poor and oppressed sectors of society. Within Western countries, {{they are more likely to}} appeal to members of the middle and <b>upper-middle</b> <b>classes,</b> with Barrett stating that new {{religions}} in the UK and US largely attract [...] "white, middle-class late teens and twenties". There are exceptions, such as the Rastafari movement and the Nation of Islam which have primarily attracted disadvantaged black youth in Western countries.|$|R
25|$|James Sanders, {{editor of}} Scenes From the City: Filmmaking in New York, 1966–2006, is {{quoted in the}} article as {{predicting}} that future films in New York City will {{move away from the}} well-worn setting of <b>upper-middle</b> <b>class</b> Manhattan neighborhoods to the outer boroughs, where they will begin examining the crosscurrents emanating from ethnic neighborhoods in Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island.|$|E
25|$|Pre-1925 {{photographs}} {{still exist}} of Quinta de Lordelo, highlighting {{the image of}} a 19th-century <b>upper-middle</b> <b>class</b> home with its romantic garden. After the death of Diogo José Cabral Jr., in 1923, his son Carlos Alberto Cabral (1895-1968), second Count of Vizela, then aged 28, took over the industry with which he was familiar, and also inherited the family state on Rua de Serralves.|$|E
25|$|The broad {{usage of}} weblogs in Iran was staggering. , the NITLE (National Institute for Technology in Liberal Education)blog census found {{the number of}} blogs in Persian surpassed 64,000. Some believe that the {{influence}} of these blogs have been exaggerated, in that their authors are predominantly upper and <b>upper-middle</b> <b>class.</b> However, the education system in Iran gives access to education and therefore new technologies, computers and {{the internet as a}} whole to large numbers of lower-class people.|$|E

50|$|As {{the sole}} {{criterion}} for student admissions into universities in Iran, Concours {{has gone through}} many phases. In prerevolutionary Iran, the exam was—as currently—a comprehensive test of knowledge and assessment of academic achievement for admissions. However, the problem in this era was that the selection methods provide advantages to candidates from urban areas, especially those from the upper and <b>upper-middle</b> <b>classes</b> with better education and preparation. Thus, almost 70 to 80 percent of university entrants came from large urban cities.|$|R
50|$|The Republican People's Party is {{currently}} a centre-left political party with traditional ties to the middle and <b>upper-middle</b> <b>classes</b> such as white-collar workers, retired generals, government bureaucrats, academics, college students, left-leaning intellectuals and labour unions such as DİSK. Nevertheless, the loose relationship between CHP and some trade unions, business chambers and most non-governmental organisations alienated many voters. The distance between the party administration and many leftist grassroots, especially left oriented Kurdish voters, contributed to the party's shift away from the political left.|$|R
25|$|Yet another {{important}} feature of the upper class is that of inherited privilege. While most Americans, including those in the <b>upper-middle</b> <b>class</b> need to actively maintain their status, some upper class persons {{do not need to}} work in order to maintain their status. Status tends to be passed on from generation to generation without each generation having to re-certify its status. Overall, the upper class is financially the best compensated {{and one of the most}} influential socio-economic classes in American society.|$|E
25|$|Class played {{prominent}} {{roles in}} the Victorian vegetarian movement. There was somewhat of a disconnect when the <b>upper-middle</b> <b>class</b> attempted {{to reach out to}} the working and lower classes. Though the meat industry was growing substantially, many working class Britons had mostly vegetarian diets out of necessity rather than out of the desire to improve their health and morals. The working and middle classes did not have the luxury being able to choose what they would eat and they believed that a mixed diet was a valuable source of energy.|$|E

50|$|Public {{schools have}} had a strong {{association}} with the ruling classes. Historically they educated {{the sons of the}} English upper and <b>upper-middle</b> <b>classes.</b> The sons of officers and senior administrators of the British Empire were educated in England while their parents were on overseas postings. In 2010, over half of Cabinet Ministers had been educated at public schools; by contrast, most prime ministers since 1964 were educated at state schools. In 2014, annual fees at Canford School and Eton College were more than £33,000 for boarders.|$|R
