5|$|Oddr Snorrason has an {{elaborate}} {{account of the}} problems arising from Thyri's marriages. He tells <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was betrothed and married to the Wendish king Burislav, who received a large dowry for her; {{but she did not}} want to be his wife and starved herself after their wedding, so Burislav sent her back to Denmark. She then arranged to have herself married to Olaf Tryggvason, to the displeasure of her brother Svein. Svein's queen, Sigrid the Haughty, a staunch opponent of Olaf, egged Svein to make war on him. Svein then conspired with Jarl Sigvaldi and King Olaf of Sweden to lure Olaf Tryggvason into a trap. Olaf Tryggvason travelled to Wendland to collect Thyri's dowry from King Burislav and while there heard rumours of a planned ambush; but Sigvaldi arrived to tell him these rumours were false. Believing Sigvaldi, Olaf sent most of his fleet home, as his men were impatient. He therefore had only a small fleet left when he was ambushed near Svolder.|$|E
25|$|St. Leo {{said that}} through faith and love she {{conceived}} her son spiritually, even before receiving {{him into her}} womb, and St. Augustine tells <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was more blessed in having borne Christ in her heart than in having conceived him in the flesh.|$|E
500|$|... 'Dance for You' puts [...] in the bedroom. Clocking in at over 6 minutes, {{the song}} of {{seduction}} plays {{as if it was}} being undressed, much like [...] is, piece by piece, lyric for lyric. As with'Speechless' and 'Cater 2 U', [...] often forgoes the independent woman anthems and beautiful power ballads to remind <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is a real sexual being rather than a formulated sex symbol. It is breathy, but not boring. It does not chronicle innocent lovemaking with sugarcoated terms, but the grittier things that really go down when you are completely comfortable (and overly confident) with, as she puts it, the person 'you'd like to thank, in case you don't thank them enough'.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes--it was beautiful. Well," [...] Kate, {{to defer}} to him still, further remarked, [...] "it's not news to <b>us</b> now <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was stupendous. Anything's possible." ...|$|R
60|$|Let <b>us</b> pray <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{will become}} so, some day; {{and we may}} have hope for her, for she is but young, and has time yet for repentance.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And she is our maiden, and it befits <b>us</b> not <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{should look}} like ane scrub,' added Jean, in the words used by her brother's descendant, a century later.|$|R
500|$|Brooks {{is thought}} to have stopped {{painting}} by several writers, but she herself tells <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> drew all her life. [...] She moved from Paris to Villa Sant'Agnese, a villa outside Florence, Italy in 1937, and in 1940fleeing the invasion of France by GermanyBarney joined her there. [...] After World War II ended, Brooks declined to move back to Paris with Barney, saying she wanted to [...] "get back to [...] painting and painter's life", but in fact she virtually abandoned art after the war. [...] She and Barney were involved in promoting her work and arranging gallery and museum placements for her paintings. [...] She became increasingly reclusive, and while Barney continued to visit her frequently, by the mid-1950s she had to stay in a hotel, meeting Brooks only for lunch. [...] Brooks spent weeks at a time in a darkened room, believing she was losing her eyesight. [...] She became paranoid, fearing that someone was stealing her drawings and that her chauffeur planned to poison her. In a 1965 letter she cautioned Barney not to lie down on the benches in her garden, lest the plants feed on her life force: [...] "Trees especially are our enemies and would suck us dry." [...] In the last year of her life, she stopped communicating with Barney entirely, leaving letters unanswered and refusing to open the door when Barney came to visit. [...] She died in Nice, France, in 1970 at the age of 96. Barney and Brooks are both buried at Passy Cemetery, Paris.|$|E
500|$|The {{video for}} [...] "Who Owns My Heart" [...] was premiered in MSN Spain on January 1, 2011. Jocelyn Vena of MTV News said, [...] "There {{comes a time}} in every pop princess' career when she must throw a sexy dance party and {{proclaim}} her womanhood. Back in 2001 Britney Spears did as much in 'I'm a Slave 4 U,' and this week, Miley Cyrus {{is doing the same}} in the video for her club-ready track 'Who Owns My Heart.'" [...] Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly assumed the theme of the video were the divergent hairstyles, but acclaimed the video for its fun. [...] Stransky said the sultry aspect of the video added to its frothy, [...] "thumpa-thumpa deliciousness". Edith Zimmerman of New York magazine viewed it as [...] "awkward". Megan Vick of Billboard thought the video followed the same steps as the video for [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] — dark lighting, lots of bare Cyrus parts and writhing around on flat surfaces. Vick recalled Amy Winehouse's [...] "Rehab" [...] video when seeing the bathroom scene and viewed the ending as a relief. Tim Winter, president of the Parents Television Council, criticized the video for its suggestiveness and sexual elements. Winter continued, [...] "It is unfortunate that she would participate in such a sexualized video like this one. It sends messages to her fanbase that are diametrically opposed to everything she has done up to this point. Miley built her fame and fortune entirely on the backs of young girls, and it saddens <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> seems so eager to distance herself from that fanbase so rapidly." ...|$|E
2500|$|Paul Sundberg, a {{veterinarian}} {{and vice president}} of the U.S. National Pork Board, a leading proponent of gestation crates, told The Washington Post: [...] "Farmers treat their animals well because that's just good business. The key to sow welfare isn't whether they are kept in individual crates or group housing, but whether the system used is well managed." [...] Sundberg said: [...] "cience tells <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> [...] doesn't even seem to know that she can't turn ... She wants to eat and feel safe, and she can do that very well in individual stalls".|$|E
60|$|I {{remember}} having {{read all the}} particulars of this remarkable affair, but I forget whether the child was rescued alive or not. At any rate let <b>us</b> hope <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was.|$|R
6000|$|... "Evidently {{they fell}} {{out about the}} {{possession}} of the captive," [...] suggested von Horn. [...] "Let <b>us</b> hope <b>that</b> <b>she</b> did not fall into the clutches of Number Thirteen--any fate {{would be better than}} that." ...|$|R
50|$|Terra offers Juno a {{gemstone}} as {{a guarantee}} of a marriage (Dresden). She asks Hymen and Cupid for a help, to bless the couple. After the final chorus, Venus' aria reminds <b>us</b> <b>that</b> only <b>she</b> can perfect fiancés' love.|$|R
2500|$|Also in 2001, {{she had a}} {{starring}} role in Alejandro Amenábar's horror film The Others as Grace Stewart, a mother living in the Channel Islands during World War II who suspects her house is haunted. Grossing over $210,947,037 worldwide, the film also earned several Goya Awards award nominations, including a Best Actress nomination for Kidman. She received her second BAFTA and fifth Golden Globe nominations. Roger Ebert commented that [...] "Alejandro Amenábar has the patience to create a languorous, dreamy atmosphere, and Nicole Kidman succeeds in convincing <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is a normal person in a disturbing situation {{and not just a}} standard-issue horror movie hysteric." [...] Kidman was named the World's Most Beautiful Person by People magazine ...|$|E
2500|$|Written on one {{sheet of}} paper: {{the text of}} the Third Secret {{released}} by the Vatican is handwritten on four sheets of paper. Father Joaquin Alonso, official Fátima archivist for sixteen years, reports in his book that, [...] "Lucy tells <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> wrote it on a sheet of paper. In a taped interview, Charles Fiore quoted Malachi Martin as saying the following regarding {{the text of the}} Third Secret: [...] "I cooled my heels in the corridor outside the Holy Father's apartments, while my boss, Cardinal Bea, was inside debating with the Holy Father, and with a group of other bishops and priests, and two young Portuguese seminarians, who translated the letter, a single page, written in Portuguese, for all those in the room." ...|$|E
2500|$|John, however, clearly {{identifies}} Mary of Bethany {{with the}} woman who anointed Christ's feet (12; cf. [...] and [...] ). It is remarkable that already in , John has spoken of Mary as [...] "she that anointed the Lord's feet", he aleipsasa. It is commonly said that he refers to the subsequent anointing which he himself describes in {{but it may be}} questioned whether he would have used he aleipsasa if another woman, and she a [...] "sinner" [...] in the city, had done the same. It is conceivable that John, just because he is writing so long after the event {{and at a time when}} Mary was dead, wishes to point out to <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was really the same as the [...] "sinner." [...] In the same way Luke may have veiled her identity precisely because he did not wish to defame one who was yet living; he certainly does something similar in the case of St. Matthew whose identity with Levi the publican (5:7) he conceals. If the foregoing argument holds good, Mary of Bethany and the [...] "sinner" [...] are one and the same.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mistress Thankful Blossom {{will make}} <b>us</b> believe <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{has at least}} in so far trusted our desire to serve her justly, by {{accepting}} our poor hospitality for a single night," [...] said Lady Washington, with a stately courtesy.|$|R
5000|$|On September 30, 2009, Brigitte's {{jury found}} her {{guilty of the}} lesser {{included}} offense of second-degree manslaughter. One juror reported that [...] "None of <b>us</b> felt <b>that</b> <b>she</b> deserved to get any murder charges or anything. So we decided on second-degree Manslaughter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop here, please, Polly. She {{knows all}} about it, Percy; and it is better for <b>us</b> both <b>that</b> <b>she</b> should be here. I have heard this morning from Lady Desborough, and also from Ada, so I {{know what you have}} come down for." ...|$|R
2500|$|On review {{aggregator}} website Rotten Tomatoes, {{the film}} has an 89% rating based on 27 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The site's consensus states: [...] "Both a smart, suspenseful tale of intrigue and a sweeping romance, The Year of Living Dangerously features excellent performances from Mel Gibson and Sigourney Weaver {{as a pair of}} journalists covering political unrest in Indonesia." [...] Metacritic reports a 65 out of 100 rating based on 9 critics, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". Film critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four out of four stars and praised Hunt's performance: [...] "Billy Kwan is played, astonishingly, by a woman—Linda Hunt, a New York stage actress who enters the role so fully that it never occurs to <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is not a man. This is what great acting is, a magical transformation of one person into another". In his review for The New York Times, Vincent Canby praised Gibson's performance: [...] "If this film doesn't make an international star of Mr. Gibson (Gallipoli, The Road Warrior), then nothing will. He possesses both the necessary talent and the screen presence".|$|E

6000|$|Up he came, whom Charlotte welcomed very demurely, and so left <b>us,</b> saying <b>that</b> <b>she</b> must {{go about}} her {{household}} business; {{but as she}} departed she cast {{a look back at}} me, making a [...] "moue," [...] as the French say, with her red lips.|$|R
5000|$|Common Sense Media said [...] "While some of {{the songs}} have a bubblegum sound and {{predictable}} lyrics, {{there are some very}} likeable bright spots on the album, including a sassy remake of the Temptations classic, The Way You Do The Things You Do, and the surprisingly jazzy, syncopated Secrets. And, not all of the songs on this album are about boy stuff. Permission to Fly is about finding your own identity; in Unconditional, Jordan reminds <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>she's</b> a girl of faith, and how that gets her through the toughest of times. If nothing else, this teen is versatile." [...] They gave the album three out of five stars.|$|R
50|$|Brenda ends up {{carrying}} Braulio's child, {{but he is}} captured, extradited {{and sent}} to a <b>US</b> prison, so <b>that</b> <b>she</b> never sees him again.|$|R
60|$|She weighed {{that with}} just the same still pause, the same quiet moment of lips and eyes that I {{recalled}} so well. It was as things had always been between <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> should make her decision first and bring me to it.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{must have}} been your mother who warned you," [...] Annie said gravely. [...] "She told <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> dreamt you were in some terrible danger, though she could not {{remember}} what it was, and she tried with all her might to warn you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And the proofs of heresy are patent, {{beside the}} strong {{suspicion}} of enchantment, and the known {{character of the}} elder sorceress.

60|$|But {{we liked}} Miss Ponsonby and we pitied her. She confided to <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was very lonely {{and that she}} wrote poetry. We never asked to see the poetry, {{although}} I {{think she would have}} liked to show it. But, as Jerry says, there are limits.|$|E

5000|$|In 1872, Ricker {{travelled}} to Germany {{and remained}} in Europe until 1876. The {{reasons for this}} excursion are unknown.
