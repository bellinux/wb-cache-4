40|$|This work {{describes}} a methodology {{to evaluate the}} landscape residual impact of an opencast coal mine in Laciana Valley (Spain), applying a landscape impact index that evaluates: the loss of visual quality of the landscape due to the extractive activity and its visual influence, depending on the visual absorption capacity of the environment, the degree of restoration of the <b>upset</b> <b>areas,</b> and its visibility from the zones most frequented by the population. Final results of the evaluation show severe and moderate impacts on landscape depending on the landscape unit. The landscape impact index is shown as a useful tool {{that can be applied}} to restoration designs, environmental vigilance plans and recovery of areas degraded by mining activity...|$|R

50|$|Prey Lang {{is under}} threat {{from a variety}} of sources which have put {{short-sighted}} economic interests ahead of a nation’s long-term well-being. Agribusiness plantations and mining operations are cutting away at the forest, including sensitive core areas. Illegal logging for timber, including luxury wood, is rampant, depriving communities of the resin trees they depend on. It is estimated that up to 250,000 resin trees have been lost to chainsaws. Illegal mining for precious metals and iron ore has also been on the increase, displacing artisanal, environmentally friendly operations. Toxic chemicals are being dumped into Prey Lang waterways, <b>upsetting</b> the <b>area’s</b> delicate ecological balance and endangering downstream communities. In addition, new roads are cutting into important and sensitive areas of the forest, and making it easier for unscrupulous actors to illegally clear forest, transport timber, and engage in poaching.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Shift {{registers}} featuring radiation-hardening-by-de-sign (RHBD) {{techniques are}} realized in IBM 8 HP SiGe BiCMOS technology. Both circuit and device-level RHBD techniques are em-ployed {{to improve the}} overall SEU immunity of the shift regis-ters. Circuit-level RHBD techniques include dual-interleaving and gated-feedback that achieve SEU mitigation through local latch-level redundancy and correction. In addition, register-level RHBD based on triple-module redundancy (TMR) versions of dual-in-terleaved and gated-feedback cell shift registers is also realized to gauge the performance improvement offered by TMR. At the de-vice-level, RHBD C-B-E SiGe HBTs with single collector and base contacts and significantly smaller deep trench-enclosed area than standard C-B-E-B-C devices with dual collector and base contacts are used to reduce the <b>upset</b> sensitive <b>area.</b> The SEU performance of these shift registers was then tested using heavy ions and stan-dard bit-error testing methods. The results obtained are compared to the unhardened standard shift register designed with CBEBC SiGe HBTs. The RHBD-enhanced shift registers perform signifi-cantly better than the unhardened circuit, with the TMR technique proving very effective in achieving significant SEU immunity.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} several methods of potential usefulness in identifying some of the factors causing erosion in two catchments 'typical' of the southern Ruahine Ranges. The condition of the southern Ruahine Ranges, in the headwaters of the Manawatu River catchment, is deteriorating. The state of equilibrium which has periodically existed between rock, soil, slope, vegetation, and climate has recently been <b>upset,</b> and the <b>area</b> is now in a state of decline. Unless remedial action is taken promptly, farm land will go out of production, public water supplies could be ruined, communications by rail, road, and telephone severely hindered, and the benefits of both the Pohangina-Oroua and Lower Manawatu Flood Control and Drainage Schemes could be lost. This study attempts to establish a basis from which positive steps to rectify the situation can be implemented. Methodology involved the use of aerial photography and on-the-ground observations and measurements. Colour and colour infrared film types were compared with standard black-and-white panchromatic film to establish which was the most suitable to use in determining priorities for erosion control. Sequential panchromatic aerial photographs were taken in 1946, 1961, 1966, and 1974. In this mountainous area, aerial photographs are essential tools for determining the extent of eroded surfaces and erosion types. Between 1946 and 1974 there has been a 120 percent increase in area of eroded slopes in the study area. The worst erosion in 1946, at which time herbivorous mammals had had little effect on vegetation, and in 1974, occurred in the 700 to 900 m altitudinal zone. This zone has the highest fault density in the study area, which consists of densely faulted and mélange-like rocks. This area has also undergone the most dramatic vegetation changes since 1946. Herbivorous mammals are considered to be only partly responsible for such changes. As a corollary, the highest percent increase in erosion has occurred in the altitudinal zone with the most intact vegetative canopy. A positive relationship between the frequency of medium-sized earthquakes and increase of eroded areas has been tentatively established. Further, most erosion has occurred during and following intense rainstorms. These two factors are considered to be the main ones causing erosion in the area. Once factors causing erosion had been established, colour, colour infrared, and panchromatic film types were compared. Photographs used in this comparison were taken periodically throughout 1975 using a 35 mm camera. An assessment was made of the capabilities of each film type to show the following features: alignments, eroded surfaces, erosion types, vegetation types and condition, rock types, pug zones, seepage areas, and drainage pattern. Colour infrared was found to be the most suitable to use when determining priorities for erosion control. A number of salient procedures that should be undertaken to determine priorities for erosion control are outlined. These include aquisition of all sequential photographs, photography using colour infrared, or preferably, using colour infrared and panchromatic film, a sound knowledge of ground conditions, and collation of relevant erosion, geological, botanical, and animal ecological data. A system that enables priority for erosion control of subcatchments to be established, using a rating value for factors causing erosion, is outlined...|$|R
