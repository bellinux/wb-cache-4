40|$|In vitro {{secretion}} of glycocorticoids by {{adrenal glands}} pooled from several control mice was {{compared with that}} of glands removed from animals following injections of either ACTH or endotoxin. Both substances prevent glycocorticoid synthesis stimulated in vitro with ACTH. Cholesterol content of adrenal glands under these conditions was nearly depleted, indicating maximal response to ACTH or endotoxin prior to their removal for the in vitro tests. In an effort to account physiologically for the manner in which endotoxin suppresses or prevents the rise in urinary nitrogen excreted in response to ACTH, blood non-protein nitrogen levels (NPN) were determined. The following experimental conditions resulted in increased urinary nitrogen excretion but did not alter blood NPN: cortisone given alone or {{at the same time as}} endotoxin; ACTH alone; dichloroisoproterenol (DCI) given concurrently with endotoxin; and lactalbumin digest injected intraperitoneally. Increases (2 - to 3 -fold) in blood NPN were observed when endotoxin was given alone, concurrently with ACTH, or 3 hours prior to cortisone, DCI, or lactalbumin digest. Urinary nitrogen excretion showed no change under these conditions. The elevation in blood NPN in endotoxin-poisoned mice was found to be due almost entirely to urea nitrogen and not to amino acid nitrogen or to other nitrogenous wastes. Blood clearance of mulin, phenol red excretion, and urea elimination were each determined in control and in endotoxin-poisoned mice. The latter mice showed impaired renal function. Treatment with diuretics (diuril and aminophylline) failed to alter oliguria or elevated blood NPN. Hydergine treatment was also without effect. Total carcass NPN and urinary nitrogen excretion data were combined to give a picture of total protein catabolized by mice under different experimental conditions. Cortisone injected at the same time as endotoxin or 3 hours later resulted in the same increase in total NPN. However, in the former case all the extra nitrogen appeared in the urine while in the latter it remained in the carcass. ACTH given alone or concurrently with endotoxin produced large increases in total NPN but less in poisoned mice. This suggests that endotoxin suppresses adrenal response to ACTH. Urea injected into normal mice was recovered quantitatively in urine while in endotoxin-poisoned mice it was partitioned between carcass and urine. Elevation of carcass NPN by means of <b>urea</b> <b>injections</b> failed to alter the lethality of an LD 70 dose of endotoxin...|$|R
40|$|Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) {{has proven}} to be the frontrunner for the removal of {{nitrogen}} oxides (NOX) from exhaust gas. EURO VI emission regulations present a challenge from the control point of view, so as to achieve high NOX conversion while keeping the ammonia slip under control. This thesis focuses on a model based feedforward control system to dose the urea. The SCR is modeled as a series of CSTR (continuously stirred tank reactor) with the main SCR chemical kinetics. The main reactions are ammonia adsorption, desorption, fast SCR, slow SCR, standard SCR and ammonia oxidation. The model is simplied so as to capture the important dynamics and be fast at the same time. A fast and computationally less demanding model is required from a control aspect if it has to be implemented online. Two control strategies were evaluated. The rst control strategy maintains a constant ammonia slip whereas the second controller maintains a constant NOX to ammonia ratio at the outlet of the SCR. The catalyst used is an extruded vanadia based catalyst. The control strategy was tested on the engine bench with a 11. 4 L catalyst and an inline 6 cylinder 12. 8 L engine. The performance of the controller was very good compared to a at urea dosing. The control strategy achieves a higher NOX conversion, less ammonia slip and uses less <b>urea</b> for <b>injection...</b>|$|R

Increasing the concentration of salicin in a diet of fruits and cereals led to significant reductions of food intake in the short term (6 days). After prolonged (20 days) exposure to salicin, food intake (19 g kg(- 0. 75) day(- 1)) was still reduced relative to controls (31 g kg(- 0. 75) day(- 1)) but not reduced to the same extent as in the short-term experiments. Nonetheless, over these 20 days, common brushtail possums regulated their intake of salicin so as not to exceed a threshold limit of 1. 9 +/- 0. 1 g kg(- 0. 75) day(- 1). Manipulative experiments sought to determine whether this threshold intake was in response to pre-ingestive factors (taste) or the post-ingestive consequences of ingesting salicin. Dietary salicin (0. 17 - 5. 0 % DM) had no significant effect on nitrogen balance or <b>urea</b> metabolism and <b>injection</b> of a specific serotonin receptor antagonist, ondansetron, did not lead to increases in salicin intake as has been found for some other plant secondary metabolites. Similarly, administration of 1. 3 g salicin by gavage had no significant effect on the subsequent intake of salicin compared to controls that were gavaged with water. We concluded that pre-ingestive factors were responsible for common brushtail possums limiting their intake of salicin-rich diets rather than any measurable post-ingestive consequence of feeding...|$|R

40|$|Achieving {{upcoming}} emissions legislation (Euro VI) {{for heavy}} trucks {{is a serious}} challenge for the manufacturers. Apart from the increasingly strict limits on nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate emissions (PM), the limited amount of fossil fuels as well as alarming climate changes simultaneously drives the demand for low CO 2 emissions. A likely solution to meet upcoming NOx limits {{is to use a}} combination of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR). Combining these two technologies poses new challenges and possibilities when it comes to optimization and calibration. Using a complete system approach, i. e. considering the engine and the aftertreatment system as a single unit, is important in order to achieve a good balance between regulated emissions and CO 2 /fuel consumption. Optimizing the complete system is a tedious task; first there are a large number of variables which affect both emissions and fuel consumption (injection timing, EGR rate, <b>urea</b> dosing, <b>injection</b> pressure, pilot/post injections for example). Secondly, the SCR catalyst has substantially slower dynamics than the diesel engine {{and the rest of the}} system, making the optimization problem time dependent. A novel approach to solve this problem is to use model based optimization which is the topic of this thesis. The first step involves developing computationally efficient models of the diesel engine, exhaust system and SCR catalyst. The engine model consists of a quasi steady gas exchange model and a zero dimensional combustion and NOx formation model. The combustion model uses a two zone concept and the NOx formation is calculated according to the Zeldovich mechanism. The exhaust system model is a dynamic mean value model and considers convective heat transfer only. The SCR catalyst model is based on a state space concept and uses customized ODE solvers to allow long time step lengths. All sub models are optimized for computational efficiency and the complete model has a simulation performance of > 10 times real time on a standard PC. The agreement with measurements is excellent; specific NOx engine out is predicted with a - 8. 5 % relative error and NOx conversion over the SCR catalyst is underpredicted with 4. 0 %. The optimization problem is formulated to minimize brake specific fuel consumption including urea cost while maintaining NOx and NH 3 emissions at Euro VI levels. The steady state optimization problem is solved in an efficient manner by using a simplified steady state solution of the SCR catalyst model. A non linear controller based on the MPC principle is developed to solve the optimization problem for transient sequences. An SQP-based optimization routine is used to solve the MPC optimization problem in each time step. The controller is applied to the certification test cycles (WHSC/WHTC). In the WHSC, the peak NH 3 slip is reduced from 85 to 17 ppm while the fuel consumption is unchanged compared to the optimum steady state calibration. Equally good results are achieved in the WHTC. Compared to a conservative steady state calibration with NOx and average NH 3 emissions on the same level, peak NH 3 slip is reduced from 102 to 47 ppm, and fuel consumption is improved by 1. 5 %...|$|R

Microfiche. xiii, 220 leaves, bound 29 cmThese studies {{addressed the}} regulation of the prolactins (PRL) and growth hormone (GH) in the tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus. Regulation of the PRL cell was investigated {{in the context of}} its potential roles in osmoregulation, metabolism, and reproduction. The in vitro release of the tPRLs (tPRL 1 77 and tPRL 1 SS) was measured as well as changes in serum concentrations and pituitary content of the PRLs and GH. These studies provide evidence that it is the osmotic gradient across the cell membrane that leads to an increase in osmotic pressure, and not osmolality per se, which accounts for the osmoreceptivity of the tilapia PRL cell. Prolactin release from pituitary tissues (rostral pars distalis; RPD) was inhibited when RPD were incubated in medium made hyperosmotic by the addition of NaCl or the membrane-impermeant molecule, mannitol; but not by the addition of the permeant molecules, <b>urea</b> or ethanol. <b>Injections</b> of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog elevated serum concentrations of the tPRLs. Furthermore, native forms of GnRH stimulated PRL release in vitro with the following order of potency: chicken-GnRH-II > salmon-GnRH > seabream-GnRH. Prolactin release was accompanied by an increase in intracellular free ca 2 +, suggesting Ca 2 + operates as a second messenger in mediating the effects of GnRH on PRL release. Estradiol- 17 β and testosterone potentiated the effects of GnRH on PRL release in vitro. Serum concentrations of the tPRLs were elevated in response to fasting, followed by increases in serum concentrations and pituitary content of GH. Serum concentrations and pituitary content of GH and serum concentrations of PRL were highest late in the brooding phase of the reproductive cycle. Reduced food intake during brooding may contribute to changes in PRL and GH serum concentrations and pituitary content. Nevertheless, patterns of changes in serum and pituitary levels of the tPRLs and GH observed during the reproductive cycle had characteristics that were both similar to and distinct from patterns observed during fasting, suggesting the hormones may have actions in both metabolism and reproduction.

40|$|In {{the last}} couple of decades, {{countries}} have enacted new laws concerning environmental pollution caused by heavy-duty commercial and passenger vehicles. This is done mainly in an effort to reduce smog and health impacts caused by the different pollutions. One of the legislated pollutions, among a wide range of regulated pollutions, is nitrogen oxides (commonly abbreviated as NOx). The SCR (Selective Catalytic Reduction) was introduced in the automotive industry to reduce NOx emissions leaving the vehicle. The basic idea is to inject a urea solution (AdBlue™) in the exhaust gas before the gas enters the catalyst. The optimal working temperature for the catalyst is somewhere in the range of 300 to 400 °C. For the reactions to occur without a catalyst, the gas temperature has to be at least 800 °C. These temperatures only occur in the engine cylinder itself, during and after the combustion. In this paper a study is presented where a second injector is installed in a Scania D 13 cylinder head for <b>urea</b> <b>injection</b> purposes. Additionally, a crank angle resolved in-cycle NOx formation model is utilized to calculate the <b>urea</b> <b>injection</b> duration for each individual injection event. A gas temperature model based on the cylinder pressure is also used to decide the timing of the <b>urea</b> <b>injection,</b> although always occurring after the combustion and during the expansion stroke.

Tekniska Verken i Linköping AB is the owner of the plant. The FTG plant consists of a boiler where garbage combustion is done. From the combustion nitrogen oxides are emitted. These nitrogen oxides are hazardous to the environment. To reduce the nitrogen oxides, injection of urea into the boiler is used. Urea is an organic compound of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen. When urea reacts with nitrogen oxides they transform into harmless nitrogen gas and water. In the plant the urea is injected by six lances. The control of the <b>urea</b> <b>injection</b> at FTG could be improved which would save some money for the company. This is the main reason for the {{aim of this}} thesis. It is the control of the total flow of urea to the lances that is studied in this work. Some literature about reduction of nitrogen oxides is studied, especially reduction using <b>urea</b> <b>injection.</b> There are a lot of factors that affect how good the reduction becomes. The most important factors are the amount of urea being used and the temperature of the flue gases where the reaction with urea takes place. A model with these two factors as inputs and the content of nitrogen oxides as output is derived. This is done with experiments in the boiler and system identification. The system is modelled as a linear system. The proposal about the improved control uses the temperature from a temperature measurement just below the <b>urea</b> <b>injection</b> in the boiler. This is a parameter that the existing control does not use. The temperature is divided into three intervals. For each interval different parameters for the function of the system and the nitrogen oxide controller are used. The nitrogen oxide controller in the proposed control is derived with help from a new method of controldesign called AMIGO. The identification models gave good results in two of the temperature intervals. The result for the third interval was not so good. This is probably due to lack of good data. The proposed control structure could for practical reasons not be tested online but preliminary tests using measurement data gave qualitatively reasonable results. In order to improve the results temperature dependence has to be treated more systematically...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: It is {{well known}} that two {{representative}} methods satisfy EURO-IV regulation from EURO-III. The first method is to achieve the regulation through the reduction of NOx in an engine by utilizing relatively high EGR rate and the elimination of subsequently increased PM by DPF. However, it results in the deterioration of fuel economy due to relatively high EGR rate. The second is to use the high combustion strategy to reduce PM emission by high oxidation rate and trap the high NOx emissions with DeNOx catalysts such as Urea-SCR. While it has good fuel economy relative to the first method mentioned above, its infrastructure is demanded.

Companies are under pressure to develop methods, which can meet the legislative demands. After treatment solutions, and especially Selective Catalytic Reduction, became the focus of research and have shown so far promising results. However, more in depth understanding of the SCR process under different conditions is needed. This thesis describes an investigation of the SCR performance using gas and urea injections under steady state and transient conditions undertaken on a light duty diesel engine using a 1 D exhaust system designed for uniform flow across the catalyst. Under steady state conditions, the SCR performance was examined for low and high temperature conditions. Ammonia was supplied either as 5 % ammonia gas or in form of <b>urea</b> <b>injection.</b> The engine was operating at 1500 rpm and 6 and 8 bar BMEP to provide an exhaust gas temperature of 210 °C and 265 °C respectively. Also, the effect of SCR brick length on the NOx conversion was investigated using SCR catalysts of length 30, 45 and 75 mm. To measure the influence of NO 2 :NOx ratio on the SCR performance, different sizes of standard DOC were used. NH 3 :NOx dosage levels included; α~ 0. 5 - deficient ammonia, α~ 1. 0 - stoichiometric ammonia, α~ 1. 25 - excess ammonia. Gas emissions were measured before and after the SCR catalysts with a Horiba FTIR analyser during steady state and long transient tests. It was found that conditions such as temperature and NO 2 :NOx had the biggest impact on the SCR performance. During the steady state engine conditions, at α~ 1. 0 ammonia dosing and NO 2 :NOx ratio of 0, only 17 % of NO was converted in the first 30 mm of the SCR brick length. The conversion was improved at high temperature (263 °C) to 31 %. A fast response CLD analyser was used during short transient testing to sample emissions with a high resolution. The short transient test with standard 0. 5 and 1 DOC, and fixed ammonia dosing, showed that NOx conversion was reduced during the ramp event due to deficient ammonia and a drop in the supplied NO 2 :NOx ratio. During <b>urea</b> <b>injection</b> experiments, urea was injected either through an oblique pipe arrangement with a mixer device placed downstream or directly into a mixing can. In this case the mixer device was replaced with a straight pipe. A 75 mm SCR was fitted and to ensure that supplied NO 2 :NOx ratio was zero, a palladium only DOC was used post a DPF. It was found that a large proportion of urea decomposition and hydrolysis was occurring {{on the surface of the}} SCR catalyst. Comparing NOx performance between <b>urea</b> <b>injection</b> and ammonia gas dosing experiment, more NO was converted for a given NH 3 :NOx ratio when ammonia was supplied in the form of gas. That was true for low and high temperature tests. For most studies, a long 10 degree diffuser was used in front of the SCR to provide uniform gas distribution across the catalyst. In addition SCR performance was investigated with a 180 degree sudden expansion diffuser in order to measure the influence of temperature and velocity profiles. During this study, a 45 mm SCR catalyst was used to provide a moderate amount of NO conversion and ammonia slip. The results showed that the flow and temperature distribution upstream of the SCR catalyst will have an effect on the NOx conversion, and that gas velocity has bigger impact on NOx conversion than gas temperature...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} methods of {{parameter}} estimation of a Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC) from engine rig experiments were investigated. The investigation did not only include methods of parameter fitting to experimental data {{but a large}} effort was also put into catalyst modeling and experimental design. Several different catalyst configurations were used with varying Pt loading, washcoat thickness and volume. To further expand the experimental space, engine operating points were chosen with a wide variation in variables (inlet conditions) and both transient and stationary operation was used. A catalyst model was developed where the catalyst washcoat was discretized as tanks in series both radially and axially and for parameter estimation a traditional gradient search method was used. Four different modeling approaches were used for parameter tuning where the most successful one tuned kinetic parameters as well as internal mass transfer parameters. It was also shown {{that it is of}} high importance that the kinetic model used has an intrinsic structure when the catalyst model separates mass transport and kinetics and when several catalyst configurations are used. A new method was evaluated where sensitivity analysis and data selection was used {{as a part of the}} parameter estimation. This methodology renders better statistical properties and should improve the parameter tuning when using gradient search methods. Furthermore, a reduced computational cost could be achieved by using only the most relevant data points during parameter tuning. The evaluated method did neither result in an improved fit to measurement data nor reduce the time for parameter tuning compared to a reference case. Adjustment of an unbalanced weighting of the residuals for the different components was identified as the most important factor for a future improvement of the method but more transient experimental data was also suggested as a possible improvement. A method of creating fast transients in concentration for a full scale engine rig system was presented and evaluated. The method included an engine rig where an SCR with <b>urea</b> <b>injection</b> and a DOC with bypass possibility were situated between the test object, which also was a DOC, and the engine. By controlling <b>urea</b> <b>injection</b> and DOC bypass a wide range of exhaust compositions, not possible by only controlling the engine, could be achieved which will improve the possibilities for parameter estimation for the modeling of the DOC in future studies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{selective}} {{catalytic reduction}} (SCR) system is a highly-effective aftertreatment device for NOx reduction of diesel engines. Generally, the ammonia (NH 3) was generated from reaction mechanism of SCR in the SCR system using the liquid urea as the reluctant. Therefore, the precise urea dosing control {{is a very important}} key for NOx and NH 3 slip reduction in the SCR system. This paper investigated NOx and NH 3 emission characteristics of urea-SCR dosing system based on model-based control algorithm in order to reduce NOx. In the map-based control algorithm, target amount of urea solution was determined by mass flow rate of exhaust gas obtained from engine rpm, torque and O 2 for feed-back control NOx concentration should be measured by NOx sensor. Moreover, this algorithm can not estimate NH 3 absorbed on the catalyst. Hence, the <b>urea</b> <b>injection</b> can be too rich or too lean. In this study, the model-based control algorithm was developed and evaluated on the numerical model describing physical and chemical phenomena in SCR system. One channel thermo-fluid model coupled with finely tuned chemical reaction model was applied to this control algorithm. The vehicle test was carried out by using map-based and model-based contro...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{carried out}} on this project developed experimentally validated Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC), Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF), and Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) high&# 8208;fidelity models {{that served as the}} basis for the reduced order models used for internal state estimation. The high&# 8208;fidelity and reduced order/estimator codes were evaluated by the industrial partners with feedback to MTU that improved the codes. Ammonia, particulate matter (PM) mass retained, PM concentration, and NOX sensors were evaluated and used in conjunction with the estimator codes. The data collected from PM experiments were used to develop the PM kinetics using the high&# 8208;fidelity DPF code for both NO 2 assisted oxidation and thermal oxidation for Ultra Low Sulfur Fuel (ULSF), and B 10 and B 20 biodiesel fuels. Nine SAE papers were presented and this technology transfer process should provide the basis for industry to improve the OBD and control of <b>urea</b> <b>injection</b> and fuel injection for active regeneration of the PM in the DPF using the computational techniques developed. This knowledge will provide industry the ability to reduce the emissions and fuel consumption from vehicles in the field.

40|$|PURPOSE: A {{decline in}} cortico-medullary {{osmolality}} gradient of the kidney {{may serve as}} an early indicator of pathological disruption of the tubular reabsorption process. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the feasibility of hyperpolarized (13) C,(15) N 2 -urea MRI as a biomarker of renal function in healthy porcine kidneys resembling the human physiology. METHODS: Five healthy female Danish domestic pigs (weight 30 [*]kg) were scanned at 3 Tesla (T) using a (13) C 3 D balanced steady-state MR pulse sequence following injection of hyperpolarized (13) C,(15) N 2 -urea via a femoral vein catheter. Images were acquired at different time points after <b>urea</b> <b>injection,</b> and following treatment with furosemide. RESULTS: A gradient in cortico-medullary urea was observed with an intramedullary accumulation 75 s after injection of hyperpolarized (13) C,(15) N 2 -urea, whereas images acquired at earlier time points postinjection were dominated by cortical perfusion. Furosemide treatment resulted in an increased urea accumulation in the cortical space, leading to a reduction of the medullary-to-cortical signal ratio of 49 %. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that hyperpolarized (13) C,(15) N 2 -urea MRI is capable of identifying the intrarenal accumulation of urea and can differentiate acute renal functional states in multipapillary kidneys, highlighting the potential for human translation.

40|$|While the NH 3 – SCR {{technology}} {{has become the}} dominant method for the abatement of NOx emitted by diesel trucks and passenger vehicles, the impact of <b>urea</b> <b>injection</b> on particle emissions {{has not yet been}} thoroughly studied. In this paper we examine a typical NH 3 – SCR configuration operating under a simulated malfunctioning condition and we study its impact on both solid and total particle number and size distribution. The tests were conducted on a light-duty diesel engine operating at both low and high load points. Its aftertreatment consisted of a commercial Fe-Zeolite SCR catalyst in series with alternatively a catalytic and an uncoated diesel particle filter. Hydrocarbon post-injection was conducted in some tests to investigate the combined effect of ammonia injection during active DPF regeneration. On average the post-DPF solid > 23 nm and total < 23 nm particle number emissions were increased 129 % (range 80 - 193 %) and 67 % (range 26 - 136 %), respectively, with 100 ppm ammonia slip. This was explicitly related with the NH 3 excess concentration, while the count median diameter of the particle distribution remained unaffected. Based on NH 3 – SCR kinetics, the particles formed should consist of ammonium sulfates or nitrates. No interaction with the unburned HCs emitted during active DPF regeneration in terms of particle formation was observed. JRC. F. 8 -Sustainable Transpor...|$|E
40|$|Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) is the {{dominant}} solution for meeting future NOx reduction regulations for heavy-duty diesel powertrains. SCR systems benefit from closed-loop control if an appropriate exhaust gas sensor were available. An ammonia sensor has recently been developed {{for use as a}} feedback element in closed-loop control of urea dosing in a diesel SCR aftertreatment system. Closed-loop control of SCR dosing enables the SCR system to be robust against disturbances and to meet conformity of production (COP) and in-use compliance norms. The ammonia sensor is based on a non-equilibrium electrochemical principle and outputs emf signals. The sensor performs well when tested in a diesel engine exhaust environment and has minimum cross interference with CO, HC, NO, NO 2, SO 2, H 2 O and O 2. Previous work, done in a simulation environment, demonstrated that an ammonia sensor provides the optimal feedback for urea dosing control algorithms in closed-loop SCR systems. A model-based SCR control strategy deploying an ammonia feedback sensor demonstrated high NOx conversion, low NH 3 slip and good robustness against disturbances. In this paper, FTP, ETC and ESC test data will be presented confirming these results. NOx conversions as high as 91 % are measured in combination with 30 % <b>urea</b> <b>injection</b> error and a 25 ppm NH 3 slip constraint. Test results using the Delphi ammonia sensor for control are compared with test results utilizing a commercially available NOx sensor for control...|$|E
