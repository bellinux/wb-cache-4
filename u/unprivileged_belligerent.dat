40|$|David Hicks is an Australian {{citizen in}} the custody of the {{government}} of the United States of America at Guantᮡmo Bay, Cuba. He was alleged to have served with the Taliban and al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. This led to his detention {{for more than five years}} as an 'unlawful combatant'. This category, it is claimed, is outside the normal protections of United States Constitutional due process and criminal law, and outside relevant provisions of international law especially the Geneva Conventions. Hicks' initial charges alleged conspiracy, attempted murder by an <b>unprivileged</b> <b>belligerent</b> and aiding the enemy. His trial before a United States military commission was due to begin in November 2005. These proceedings were cancelled following the Supreme Court ruling in Hamdan v Rumsfeld 1 that declared the military commission process unconstitutional and illegal.

David Hicks will stand trial before a United States military commission in January 2005. Having been detained in Guantanamo Bay (‘Gitmo’ in US military slang) {{for nearly three years}} as an ‘enemy combatant’, he will have his day in court to face charges of conspiracy to commit war crimes, attempted murder by an <b>unprivileged</b> <b>belligerent</b> and aiding the enemy. It will not, however, be a court familiar to Australian citizens. Common law rules of evidence will not apply. The counsel appearing for the accused will be assigned from the military. The judgement will be delivered by military personnel. There will be no avenues of appeal to a non-military court. An agreement has been reached between the Australian and US governments that, in the case of Hicks, the death penalty will not be considered and the hearing will be open; it is not known if these concessions will apply to those detainees whose governments have not reached such agreements with the US. Even before the trial process begins, Hicks’ family and lawyers are claiming that he has been subjected to physical and mental abuse while being detained and interrogated. The facts of the alleged abuse are open to debate, what is not is that he was held for more than {{two and a half years}} before being charged. Clearly, prosecuting a War on Terror creates rights predicaments beyond even those evidenced in twentieth century guerrilla warfare; the human rights vacuum created at Gitmo is a direct consequence of the refusal of the current US administration to acknowledge the importance of these dilemmas.

40|$|In modern times, the {{presence}} of Private military companies (PMC) in armed conflicts has increased. The practical use of these PMCs, in armed conflicts, has created problems with regard to determining their legal status under International Humanitarian Law (IHL). This paper examines {{the legal status of}} the personnel in PMCs in armed conflicts and reveals that the only way that the personnel in PMCs may have legal status as combatants is if they are incorporated into the armed forces of a state. State practice, on the other hand, shows that this is not actually implemented in modern armed conflicts. Instead, the research shows that it is state practice to consider personnel in PMCs to have legal status as civilians, something which includes both the legal status as persons who accompany the armed forces and ordinary civilians. 1 With regard to the legal status as persons who accompany the armed forces, the research reveals that the US Department of Defence is of the opinion that persons who accompany the armed forces, who have a primary status as civilians, may participate in hostilities without loosing the right of their secondary status as prisoners of war (POW). This is an interpretation that may be understood as being contrary to the view in IHL, which says that civilians loose their privileges when and during the time they participate in hostilities.. Based on the state practice which indicates that the personnel in PMCs have the legal status as civilians, this paper argues that the personnel in PMCs, who provide services in armed conflicts which require direct participation in the hostilities, may be classified as <b>unprivileged</b> <b>belligerents.</b> The research also shows that personnel in PMCs in certain circumstances may be classified as mercenaries, but examples indicate that this is less likely to happen in reality. As the participation of PMCs in modern armed conflict is increasing, this research urges the need for international and national initiatives and policies to regulate the use of PMCs and to determine the legal status of their personnel. The study also emphasizes the need for extended education of the armed forces in IHL, in particular regarding the legal status of the personnel in PMCs...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{acquittal}} of {{the first}} Guantanamo Bay detainee to stand trial in U. S. federal court on {{all but one of}} the 286 charges he faced stemming from the 1998 bombings of two U. S. embassies in Africa has reinvigorated the discussion on indefinite detention under the laws of war. While the issue has been raised in the past, the discussion hasn’t extended beyond stating that the law of war, or law of armed conflict (LOAC) as it is often called, provides a legal basis for detention, including detention for the duration of hostilities. In fact, the Obama Administration has made it clear that some detainees will be held indefinitely “under the laws of war” but has provided no clear guidance as to what that detention would look like. This article seeks to extend the dialogue to substantive consideration of whether the LOAC rules on detention are sufficiently flexible and comprehensive to provide worthwhile and meaningful individual protections the United States could apply to those who are detained indefinitely. Historical practice has generally involved detention for much shorter periods of time than many at Guantanamo have already been detained. There are some notable exceptions, however, where fighters were detained for extended periods of time, including more than twenty years in the case of Morocco. Surprisingly, considering the number of armed conflicts that have involved detention, there is no common international practice concerning long-term or indefinite detention upon which states may rely. The question then becomes, assuming that long-term and potentially indefinite detention of unlawful enemy combatants (or <b>unprivileged</b> enemy <b>belligerents)</b> will occur as justified by the law of war, what should that detention look like? This article argues that the basic provisions and safeguards currently extant in the law of armed conflict are sufficient to satisfy an indefinite detention paradigm. Though many of these provisions are under-utilized or ineffective in the current detention framework, the current structure could be adapted to provide a LOAC detention model that accounts for a contemporary view of individual rights, protections, and privileges. Such an adapted paradigm would be completely appropriate for the indefinite detention of the 48 detainees designated by the U. S. Government to be held at Guantanamo Bay, and would provide all the safeguards and ensure the overall security necessary for that detention until the conflict is over or until the detainees no longer pose a risk...|$|R
