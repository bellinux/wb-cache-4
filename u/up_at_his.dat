5|$|A common {{plot device}} is referenced, where a {{shoulder}} angel (represents conscience) and a shoulder devil (representing temptation) appear near a character. This concept is spoofed in the episode, {{as both the}} devil and the angel suggest to Mackey that he should drink the beer. When Stan tells Kyle what he thinks a bris means, a dolly zoom is used, which is an unsettling filmmaking effect often used {{to show that a}} character is undergoing a major realization. The hallucinogenic effects of certain drugs are portrayed by different means. When inhaling cannabis, the alley that Mr. Mackey is in suddenly turns very colorful. After taking LSD, Mackey's head inflates like a giant balloon, and then literally detaches from his body, and floats away (the boys interact with Mackey by looking <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> head as it floats over them).|$|E
5|$|Born 22 September 1905 into {{a family}} of Finnish origin in Oslo (then named Kristiania), he was baptized Håkon Steen Lie. He would later change the {{spelling}} to Haakon during World War II. His father was fireman Andreas Lie (1870-1942) {{and his mother was}} homemaker Karen Halvorsdatter Gunderud (1871-1952). Though he describes his childhood as a happy one, his family was poor and, until 1916, his father had to work 120 hours a week. With his parents, two brothers, and two sisters, he grew <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> fathers fire-station sharing one room and a kitchen in the St. Hanshaugen neighborhood. Lie got involved with the labour movement at the age of sixteen, in 1921.|$|E
25|$|Savile’s {{name was}} removed from street signs put up in his honour, and the headstone on his grave was removed and broken <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> family’s request.|$|E

25|$|Frampton {{claims that}} after Marriott's {{departure}} from the Small Faces, the remaining members, Lane, McLagan and Jones, turned <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> home and offered him Marriott's role in the band. (Ian McLagan vehemently denied this story).|$|E
25|$|It was {{intended}} to be a sanctuary, assembly hall and headquarters of the New and Latter House of Israel, as the church was now called. Around the perimeter there would be shops plus accommodation for Israel’s International College — a school he had already set <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> home in Woodlands Road, Gillingham.|$|E
25|$|Conyers {{gained a}} {{reputation}} as a spiritual adviser, and converted outbuildings at Deptford to continue his pattern of religious study built <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> Helmsley chapel. He lectured four nights every week. He associated with evangelicals including George Pattrick, William Romaine and Henry Venn. Basil Woodd's 1784 memoir of his mother Hannah was {{in the form of a}} letter to Conyers.|$|E

60|$|Kaplan looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him, <b>his</b> face white, {{his eyes}} wide with terror. His mouth opened and closed, but no sound came.|$|R
25|$|McCain has {{repeatedly}} argued that low-skilled immigrant labor {{is necessary to}} supply service roles that native-born Americans refuse. In one widely remarked-upon incident, he insisted to a union group {{that none of them}} would be willing to pick lettuce for fifty dollars an hour. The audience interrupted with offers and several weeks later demonstrators showed <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> Phoenix office to apply for lettuce picking work.|$|E
25|$|Sugihara {{died the}} {{following}} year {{at a hospital in}} Kamakura, on 31 July 1986. In spite of the publicity given him in Israel and other nations, he remained virtually unknown in his home country. Only when a large Jewish delegation from around the world, including the Israeli ambassador to Japan, showed <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> funeral, did his neighbors find out what he had done. He may have lost his diplomatic career but he received much posthumous acclaim.|$|E
25|$|The matter {{became a}} scandal in French {{politics}} and Bourbons officials {{tried to cover}} it <b>up.</b> <b>At</b> <b>his</b> court martial at Port de Rochefort in 1817 Chaumareys was tried on five counts but acquitted of abandoning his squadron, of failing to re-float his ship and of abandoning the raft. However he {{was found guilty of}} incompetent and complacent navigation and of abandoning the Méduse before all her passengers had been taken off. Even though this verdict exposed him to the death penalty, Chaumareys was sentenced to only three years in jail.|$|E
60|$|Lawford sat drawn <b>up,</b> staring <b>at</b> <b>his</b> companion's face in {{an intense}} and {{helpless}} silence. His mouth opened but no words came.|$|R

25|$|Kendall {{moves back}} home {{not long after}} being awake from her coma. Reese can sense that Kendall is uneasy with her and Bianca living there. She talks with Kendall alone, but it is {{apparent}} that Kendall is distant. After their conversation, Reese leaves the room and Zach comes in. Kendall tells Zach that she wants Reese and Bianca out of their home. Zach later obliges Kendall's wishes and sets Reese and Bianca <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> casino to stay. Reese and Bianca get into a fight while there, but later reconcile.|$|E
25|$|McCartney {{recorded}} the album in secrecy, mostly using basic home-recording equipment set <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> house in St John's Wood. Mixing and some later recording {{took place at}} professional studios in London, which McCartney booked under an alias to maintain anonymity. Apart from occasional contributions by his wife, Linda, he performed the entire album by himself, playing every instrument. In its preference for loosely arranged performance over polished production, McCartney explored the back-to-basics style {{that had been the}} original concept for the Beatles' Let It Be project (then titled Get Back) in 1969.|$|E
25|$|Maria Hunt Belanger (Maggie Siff) — A youth {{social worker}} who assists when a young child is a witness to a crime. Although she's Gene's daughter, they have a {{strictly}} professional relationship and are largely estranged from each other on a personal level. She and Sam are immediately attracted to each other, and end up having sex in the precinct house's file room; she later shows <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> address wearing nothing but a trench coat. However, Sam only later learns that she's the boss' daughter, and desperately tries to keep Gene from finding out what happened.|$|E
60|$|The two men parted {{with some}} restraint. Deane, {{after a few}} minutes' hesitation, went to the {{telephone}} and called <b>up</b> Vine <b>at</b> <b>his</b> club.|$|R

25|$|Simon {{was born}} on May 20th 1776 {{in the village of}} Mapletown, Hoosick, New York. He was the eighth and {{youngest}} child of Captain Simon Fraser (d.1779), of the 84th Highland Regiment, and Isabella Grant, daughter of the Laird of Daldregan. Captain Simon Fraser grew <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> family's seat, Guisachan (Scottish Gaelic: 'Giùthsachan'), as the second son of William Fraser (d.1755), 8th Laird of Guisachan and 3rd Laird of Culbokie, by his wife Catherine, daughter of John McDonell, 4th Laird of Ardnabie. The Frasers of Guisachan and Culbokie were descended from a younger brother of the 10th Chief of the Frasers of Lovat.|$|E
25|$|Salemme took {{advantage}} of Ferrara's imprisonment to become the de facto leader of the Patriarca family. He still faced the challenge of Ferrara's crew and the other Argiulo loyalists in the North End. Both sides reportedly drew up lists of people they intended to kill, and began doing so. At one point the brother of one intended target was killed on the street while changing a flat tire. Many Patriarca operatives report {{that they were in}} constant fear for their lives during this period; one told Globe reporter Stephen Kurkjian in 2014 that after learning his name was on one of the lists and that two men had shown <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> sister's home looking for him, he moved to the far north of New England and began living under an assumed name.|$|E
25|$|Lee was {{an early}} {{influence}} on physician and human rights activist H. Jack Geiger. They met in 1940 when Geiger, a 14-year-old middle-class Jewish runaway, was backstage at a Broadway production of Native Son. Lee agreed to take Geiger in when he showed <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> door in Harlem asking {{for a place to}} stay. With the consent of his parents, Geiger stayed with Lee for over a year. Lee took on the role of surrogate father and introduced Geiger to Langston Hughes, Billy Strayhorn, Richard Wright, and Adam Clayton Powell. Geiger eventually became a journalist, then a doctor who co-founded the first community health center in the United States, Columbia Point Health Center in Dorchester, Massachusetts. He became a founder of Physicians for Social Responsibility and Physicians for Human Rights, and established community health centers in Mississippi and South Africa. Geiger says he would never have moved so deeply in these worlds so quickly if not for his experiences with Canada Lee.|$|E

25|$|Bas started {{training}} boxing in {{the backyard}} of an elementary school with a friend. Rutten became interested in martial arts at age 12 after his family went on vacation to France, where the movie Enter the Dragon starring Bruce Lee was playing at a local movie theatre. Bas could not get in because the movie was rated 17+, so {{he and his brother}} Sjoerd snuck into the theatre. After he saw the movie, he took an interest in martial arts. At first, his conservative parents didn't allow him to pursue, but after two years of begging his parents, at age 14, they allowed him to practice taekwondo. He picked it up very quickly and after a few months he got in a street fight with the biggest bully in town. Rutten, now more confident, took the challenge and broke the bully's nose and KO'd him with the first punch he threw. The police showed <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> parent's place, and Rutten was immediately prohibited by his parents from further practicing martial arts.|$|E

She later observes as Jesse and Rachel kiss, and exchanges knowing looks with Jesse.|$|E
