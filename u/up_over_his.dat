5|$|Investigators {{believed}} the aircraft captain survived {{for a short}} time after the crash. His body was a short distance away from his seat and both were a few metres ahead of the wreckage where they had been thrown after the nose of the aircraft was split open in the impact with a large tree. The seat belt had not broken, but it had been undone. The captain's tunic was pulled <b>up</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> head as though to protect his face from the heat of the nearby inferno. Investigators believed he survived the crash and undid his seat belt to drag himself away from the fire. His body was not burnt, but autopsy showed both his legs were broken and he died from a fractured skull.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{broken and}} {{incoherent}} radio messages between Lieber {{and the search}} party are intercepted by intelligence agents tracking their progress, and rumours begin to spread across the world of Hitler's capture. Debates flare <b>up</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> impending trial, {{where it will be}} held and under whose jurisdiction. Orosso is identified as the nearest airfield to the last known location of the search party, and aircraft begin arriving at the hitherto unknown town. But when the search party loses radio contact with Lieber, they must make a decision to either wait out the storms and deliver their captive to Lieber later, or try Hitler in the jungle. They choose the latter, given that they would likely lose control of the situation if they attempted to transport their prisoner. Against Lieber's advice ("You must not let him speak... his tongue is like no other") they prepare for a trial with a judge, prosecution and defence attorneys selected from the members of the search party. Teku, a local Indian tracker, is asked to observe the trial as an independent witness.|$|E
25|$|In {{his first}} fight of 1992, he faced former world heavyweight {{champion}} Larry Holmes, who was 42 years old, {{and had just}} pulled off an upset against Ray Mercer. During the bout, Holyfield suffered the first scar of his career with a gash opening <b>up</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> eye, the result of Holmes' elbow. The fight ended with a unanimous decision in favor of Holyfield.|$|E

25|$|McCulloch's {{time as a}} Brentford player {{came to an end}} in May 1979 when he {{was persuaded}} to join Third Division Sheffield Wednesday. Wednesday manager Jack Charlton was looking for a target man to partner Terry Curran in The Owls forward line and saw McCulloch as the ideal man. Charlton was working as a pundit for ITV on the 1979 FA Cup Final and met McCulloch on the Wembley gantry and agreed a deal which went through officially the {{following}} month. Jack Charlton, who had a tendency to get mixed <b>up</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> player’s names often referred to McCulloch as “Ian”, confusing him with Notts County’s Scottish winger Iain McCulloch. The McCulloch-Curran partnership contributed 34 goals in the following 1979–80 season as Wednesday were promoted.|$|E
25|$|While Charlie, Larry, and Dr. Amita Ramanujan (Navi Rawat), Charlie's {{girlfriend and}} colleague, develop their model, Larry {{receives}} {{a phone call}} informing him that {{he is no longer}} a part of the mission. At Charlie's house, Charlie and Amita learn from Alan Eppes (Judd Hirsch), Don and Charlie's father, that a MIT professor had asked NASA to look into Larry's recent behavior. As a result of Larry's homelessness, NASA decided to pull Larry from the mission. FBI Special Agent David Sinclair (Alimi Ballard) and Colby Granger (Dylan Bruno) take Brendan McCrary (George Newbern), a frequent visitor in the chat room that the molesters used, into custody. When the team questions McCrary, they learn, and further investigation confirms, that McCrary joined an online group which attempts to peacefully catch child molesters after his daughter was raped and murdered by one. While working on their model, Charlie tells Amita that he feels bad for being happy that Larry was not going to space, and Amita tells Charlie that he should not beat himself <b>up</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> emotions. Their analysis soon reveals that the killer's preferred houses are located in Megan's Law and Jessica's Law zones.|$|E
500|$|Following Pinney's arrival the {{division}} was withdrawn {{for two months}} to reorganise, missing the Battle of Flers-Courcelette, and saw some fighting in {{the very end of}} the fighting on the Somme when a [...] "pretentious" [...] plan produced by {{the division}}al command to capture a German trench system at night failed. The 33rd remained on the Somme front until March 1917, when it was transferred to Amiens to participate in the Arras Offensive. Here, the division fought at the Second Battle of the Scarpe in late April, where it took 700 prisoners but suffered heavy losses. This was followed by a series of attacks on the Hindenburg Line in late May, the first of which, on the night of 20 May, was masterminded by Pinney—one observer noted that [...] "his tail is right <b>up</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> back ... he was out for a gamble with his troops and he had it", though sadly added that despite its great success, he still refused to authorise an issue of rum. A second attack on 27 May was a complete failure; Pinney later explained the attack as having been a distraction in support of the coming Battle of Messines, an interpretation greeted with some cynicism by observers.|$|E

60|$|He had {{suddenly}} checked himself. Where he {{got all the}} additional black prongs from, that now flew <b>up</b> all <b>over</b> <b>his</b> head like the myriads of points that break out in the large change of a great firework, was a wonderful mystery.|$|R

60|$|Quite innocently the German lad {{took off}} his coat and rolled his shirt sleeve <b>up</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> elbow. Then he took the big Roman candle and lit it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I reckon 'twas slick," [...] {{said the}} Colonel, thoughtfully. [...] "You know old man Wright hates a {{solicitor}} like poison. He has his notions.

6000|$|... "And precisely, {{here is my}} father, who {{has come}} to escort me home," [...] said Mademoiselle Noemie. [...] "He speaks English. He will arrange with you."

6000|$|... "Ay, {{it would}} be a longish shoot," [...] said the old fellow, turning to look <b>over</b> <b>his</b> shoulder; and then he put <b>up</b> <b>his</b> hand <b>over</b> <b>his</b> eyes, and stood staring.|$|R
60|$|You {{stand over}} {{him while he}} writes the {{appointment}} down {{on a sheet of}} foolscap, and watch him pin it <b>up</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> desk. Then you come away contented.|$|E

6000|$|... "My dear!" [...] Mr. McCall's {{voice was}} alarmed. [...] "What is it?" [...] His eyes had climbed <b>up</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> glasses and {{remained}} there. [...] "What is the matter? Is anything wrong?" ...|$|E
60|$|That {{evening after}} dusk, in {{the stress of}} writing letters, he sent her out for stamps.

60|$|It was a {{pleasant}} winter and a long one, for she did not leave Mrs. Kirke till June. Everyone seemed sorry when the time came.

60|$|And so {{lay down}} upon his bed, {{and put his}} arms <b>up,</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> head and ears, as {{resolute}} from that time to keep out all access, and to die in his indifference.|$|E

50|$|Ziegler at {{one time}} owned a sloop yacht named Thistle, which was entered {{in the race for}} the Kaiser's Cup.
