No allowance is made for direct effects of materials microstructure and almost all the mechanical models were obtained based on crystalline ceramics. In order to improve the mechanical models of ceramics, surface grinding experiments on crystalline ceramics and non-crystalline ceramics were conducted in this research. The normal and tangential grinding forces were measured to calculate single grit force and specific grinding energy. Grinding surfaces were observed. For crystalline alumina ceramics, the predictive modeling of normal force per grit fits well with the experimental result, when the maximum <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> {{is less than a}} critical depth, which turns out to be close to the grain size of alumina. Meanwhile, there is a negative correlation between the specific grinding energy and the maximum <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> <b>thickness.</b> With the decreasing maximum <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> <b>thickness,</b> the proportions of ductile removal and transgranular fracture increase.

For ultra-precision machining of brittle glass materials, critical <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> (CUCT) commonly plays {{a pivotal role in}} determining the transition point from ductile cutting to brittle cutting. In this research, cutting characteristics in nanometric cutting of BK 7 and fused silica glasses, including machined surface morphology, surface roughness, cutting force and specific cutting energy, were investigated with nanometric plunge-cutting experiments.

They {{are used as}} veneer-core bilayer all-ceramic or metal-fused ceramic restorations or monolithic inlays/onlays/crowns to replace missing or damaged tooth structures for aesthetic and functional purposes. However, glass ceramic materials, such as feldspar and leucite glass ceramics, which are subject to this investigation, are brittle and easily induced microfractures in abrasive cutting using dental handpieces and coarse burs. In this paper, we investigated the dental abrasive cutting characteristics of feldspar and leucite glass ceramics using a high-speed electric handpiece and coarse diamond burs. Cutting forces, specific removal energy, surface roughness and morphology were investigated as functions of specific material removal rate and maximum <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> <b>thickness.</b> The results indicate that increasing the specific material removal rate or the maximum <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> resulted in increases in both tangential and normal forces, but a decrease in specific removal energy for both ceramics.

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{analyzing}} the tool-workpiece-contact area in cutting processes is presented. To gain enhanced knowledge about tool-workpiece interaction, determination of <b>chip</b> <b>thickness,</b> contact length and resulting cross-section {{area of the}} <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> is of major interest. Compared to common simulation approaches, where rotation-symmetrically constructed tool geometry is used, the new method uses a detailed three dimensional tool shape model for an extended and more accurate contact zone analysis. As a corresponding representation of the workpiece and its time dependent shape-changes a multidexel model is used. To prepare the geometric tool model, the contained BREP topology is built up within the simulation system using data from a STEP-file. First of all functional parts of the tool like rake and flank faces and cutting edges are labeled for further processing. In a second step the identified NURBS-faces are discretized for the application in material-removal calculation. This way a mesh is built-up based on triangle elements which maps the geometry of each cutting edge into a 2 D parametric representation. In relation to rake face, each node is described by its position {{on the cutting edge}} and its perpendicular distance to this edge. To perform contact zone analysis each cutting geometry and a multidexel model are intersected in discrete time steps corresponding to a tool rotation of about three degrees. The intersection point of each dexel and the cutting geometry is calculated. Parametric cutting geometry allows for a direct computation of local cutting depth and contact length for each involved point. Based on the local values of contact length and cross section area of the <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> the characteristic values for the entire contact zone are calculated and used to predict mechanical as well as thermal loads caused by the cutting process. To demonstrate the application of the novel approach, prediction of forces in slot milling of 1. 1191 steel is presented...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIt is a {{challenging}} task to avoid ploughing effects in micro-milling. When one tooth of {{the cutting tool}} crosses the minimum <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> boundary, the tool would enter into the ploughing zone with no chip formation. Therefore, it is significant to predict the ploughing volume and forces in micro-milling. In this work, the ploughing mechanism for micro-milling is proposed by considering the minimum <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> effects. A 3 D chip geometry is developed to calculate <b>chip</b> <b>thickness,</b> ploughing volume and ploughing forces in micro 5 -axis flat-end milling with a flat-end mill. The local parallel sliced tool based method is then applied to get cutter-workpiece engagement domain where the cutting flutes entry and exit the workpiece, minimum <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> and depth of cut are required to predict ploughing forces. Local parallel sliced method divides the cutting tool into several slices that are perpendicular to the tool axis along the local coordinate system. On each layer, the removal chip area is dividing into ploughing zone and shearing zone by the minimum <b>chip</b> <b>thickness.</b> Ploughing zone is the area as <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> {{is less than the}} minimum <b>chip</b> <b>thickness.</b> In the shearing zone, <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> is larger than the minimum <b>chip</b> <b>thickness.</b> The total <b>chip</b> ploughing volume is obtained by adding all ploughing area along axial direction...|$|R

40|$|Machining along {{continuous}} circular tool-path trajectories avoids tool stoppage {{and even}} feed rate variation. This helps particularly in high-speed milling {{by reducing the}} effect of the machine tool mechanical structure and cutting process dynamics. With the increase in popularity of this machining concept, the need for detailed study of a valid chip formation in circular end milling is becoming necessary for accurate kinematic and dynamic modeling of the cutting process. In this paper, chip formation during circular end milling is studied with a major focus on feed per tooth and <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> along with their analytical derivations and numerical solutions. At first, the difference in the feed per tooth formulation for end milling along linear and circular tool-path trajectories is presented. In the next step, valid formulation of the <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> in circular end milling is derived by considering an epitrochoidal tooth trajectory {{with a wide range of}} the tool-path radius. The complex transcendental equations encountered in the derivation are dealt with, by a case-based approach to obtain closed-form analytical solutions. The analytical solutions of <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> are validated with results of numerical simulations of tool and tooth trajectories for circular end milling and also compared to the linear end milling. The close resemblance between analytical and numerical calculations of the <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> in circular end milling suggests validity of the proposed analytical formulations. As a case study, the cutting forces in circular end milling are calculated based on the derived chip thickness formulations and an existing mechanistic model.

40|$|Brittle {{materials}} such as silicon, germanium, glass and ceramics are widely used in semiconductor, optical, micro-electronics and various other fields. Traditionally, grinding, polishing and lapping have been employed to achieve high tolerance in surface texture of silicon wafers in semiconductor applications, lenses for optical instruments etc. The conventional machining processes such as single point turning and milling are not conducive to brittle materials as they produce discontinuous chips owing to brittle failure at the shear plane before any tangible plastic flow occurs. In order to improve surface finish on machined brittle materials, ductile regime machining is being extensively studied lately. The process of machining brittle materials where the material is removed by plastic flow, thus leaving a crack free surface is known as ductile-regime machining. Ductile machining of brittle materials can produce surfaces of very high quality comparable with processes such as polishing, lapping etc. The objective of this project {{is to develop a}} comprehensive predictive model for ductile machining of brittle materials. The model would predict the critical <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> required to achieve ductile-regime machining. The input to the model includes tool geometry, workpiece material properties and machining process parameters. The fact that the scale of ductile regime machining is very small leads to a number of factors assuming significance which would otherwise be neglected. The effects of tool edge radius, grain size, grain boundaries, crystal orientation etc. are studied so as to make better predictions of forces and hence the critical <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> <b>thickness.</b> The model is validated using a series of experiments with varying materials and cutting conditions. This research would aid in predicting forces and <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> values for micro-machining brittle materials given their material properties and process conditions. The output could be used to machine brittle materials without fracture and hence preserve their surface texture quality. The need for resorting to experimental trial and error is greatly reduced as the critical parameter, namely <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> <b>thickness,</b> is predicted using this approach. This can in turn pave way for brittle materials to be utilized in a variety of applications. Ph. D.

Although significant research is performed in this field, grinding still experiences problems with burn and high forces {{which can lead to}} poor quality components and damage to equipment. This generally occurs in grinding when the process deviates from its safe working conditions. In milling, <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> parameters are utilised to predict and maintain process outputs leading to improved control of the process. This thesis looks to further the knowledge of the relationship between <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> and the grinding process outputs to provide an increased predictive and maintenance modelling capability. Machining trials were undertaken using different <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> parameters to understand how these affect the process outputs. The <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> parameters were maintained at different grinding wheel diameters for a constant productivity process to determine the impact of <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> at a constant material removal rate. Additional testing using a modified pin on disc test rig was performed to provide further information on process variables. The different <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> parameters provide control of different process outputs in the grinding process. These relationships can be described using contact layer theory and heat flux partitioning. The contact layer is defined as the immediate layer beneath the contact arc at the wheel workpiece interface. The size of the layer governs the force experienced during the process. The rate of contact layer removal directly impacts the net power required from the system. It was also found that the specific grinding energy of a process is more dependent on the productivity of a grinding process rather than the value of <b>chip</b> <b>thickness.</b> Changes in <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> at constant material removal rate result in microscale changes in the rate of contact layer removal when compared to changes in process productivity.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of brittle-ductile cutting mode transition has received much attention {{over the past}} two decades. Due to the difficulties in directly observing the cutting zone during the brittle-ductile cutting mode transition by experimental techniques, many molecular dynamics (MD) studies have been conducted to investigate the atomicscale details of the phenomena, e. g. phase transformation, stress distribution and crack initiation, mostly under nanoscale undeformed chip thicknesses. A research gap is that direct MD modelling of the transition under practical undeformed chip thicknesses was not achieved in previous studies, due to the limitations in both computation capability and interaction potential. Important details of the transition under practical undeformed chip thicknesses thereby remain unclear, e. g. the location of crack formation and the stress distribution. In this study, parallel MD codes based on graphics processing units (GPU) are developed to enable large-scale MD simulations with multi-million atoms. In addition, an advanced interaction potential which reproduces brittle fracture much more accurately is adopted. As a result, the direct MD simulation of brittle-ductile cutting mode transition is realised for the first time under practical undeformed chip thicknesses. The MD-modelled critical <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> is verified by a plunge cutting experiment. The MD modelling shows that tensile stress exists around the cutting zone and increases with <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> <b>thickness,</b> which finally induces brittle fractures.

The technological area of interest was marked off by cutting speeds of some few meters per second and depths of cut in the magnitude of a micron typical machining parameters {{in a number of}} abrasive gear finishing processes, e. g. gear honing. The chip formation mechanisms have been investigated by single grain scratching tests. It has been shown, that low cutting speeds in combination with small <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> enhance micro-ploughing and make the chip formation less efficient. Higher values for cutting speed and larger <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> result in increasing micro-cutting. For the most efficient chip formation, the values for cutting speed and <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> have to be chosen as high as possible. Investigations of the tribological process behaviour have been carried out in grinding experiments. They were aimed at quantifying the influence of friction and tool specification on the effective material removal. Experimental findings allow to differentiate the friction influence dependent on the chosen cutting speed and (equivalent) <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> by application of the Stribeck diagram. The most efficient material removal was achieved at a boundary lubrication condition, when the cutting speed and <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> were set at their highest values. This result confirms the single grain tests findings. Applying an abrasive wear map, process behaviour of different tool specifications at constant grinding conditions was found out to correlate with the effective single grain <b>chip</b> <b>thickness.</b> The higher it is, the higher are the process friction, effective material removal and tool wear. At low <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> values, due to dominating micro-ploughing, high compressive residual stresses in the workpiece subsurface are induced. A principle transferability of the experimental results to the technology of gear honing has been shown...|$|R
30|$|Ultraprecision {{machining}} at nanometric {{scale is}} increasingly required in micromachining and nanomachining to produce parts of intricate features and surface finish quality[1]. Material removal {{at such a}} small uncut <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> involves subsurface deformation, and in conventional cutting, the effect of subsurface deformation is neglected as the uncut <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> is significant. However, {{it is not the}} same case in nanocutting due to the small uncut <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> on the order of several nanometers or less[2]. Thus, the effect of subsurface deformation should not be neglected as the uncut <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> is in the same scale. Subsurface deformed layer is related to the deformation and damage in the material especially in the micro- and nanoscales, in which not only the size is reduced substantially but also the physical characteristics on optics and electricity of the material become different. Recently, the mechanisms of subsurface deformation have become the key issues to be investigated.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the effects of 2 dimensional Ultrasonic Vibration Assisted Milling (UVAM) cutting mechanics, considering tool path trajectory and the effect on the <b>chip</b> <b>thickness.</b> The theoretical modelling of cutting mechanics is focused by considering the trajectory of the tool locus into the workpiece during the machining. The studies found the major advantages of VAM are come from the intermittent tool tip interaction phenomena between cutting tool and workpiece. The reduction of thinning <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> formations can be identifying advantages from vibration assisted milling in 2 dimensional. The finding will be discussing the comparison between conventional machining the potential of the advantages toward the <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> and <b>chip</b> formation in conclusion...|$|R
