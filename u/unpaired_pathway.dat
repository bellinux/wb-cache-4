40|$|Paired pre- and postsynaptic {{activity}} in area CA 1 of the hippocampus induces long-term inhibitory synaptic plasticity at GABAergic synapses. This pairing-induced GABAergic plasticity weakens synaptic inhibition {{due to a}} depolarization of the reversal potential for GABAA receptor-mediated currents (EGABA) through {{a decrease in the}} function of the neuron-specific K+-Cl- cotransporter KCC 2. When pairing-induced GABAergic plasticity is induced at feedforward inhibitory synapses in the CA 1, the decrease in inhibition produces an increase in the amplitude of Schaffer collateral-mediated postsynaptic potentials in pyramidal neurons. This form of inhibitory synaptic plasticity is termed disinhibition-mediated long-term potentiation (LTP). In the present study, we investigated whether disinhibition-mediated LTP is synapse specific. We performed these experiments in hippocampal slices prepared from adult Sprague Dawley rats. We found that the underlying depolarization of EGABA is not restricted to the paired pathway, but rather is expressed to the same extent at unpaired control pathways. However, the overall strength of GABAergic transmission is maintained at the <b>unpaired</b> <b>pathway</b> by a heterosynaptic increase in GABAergic conductance. The pairing-induced depolarization of EGABA at the paired and unpaired pathways required Ca 2 +-influx through both the L-type voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors. However, only Ca 2 +-influx through L-type channels was required for the increased conductance at the <b>unpaired</b> <b>pathway.</b> As a result of this increased GABAergic conductance, disinhibition-mediated LTP remains confined to the paired pathway and thus is synapse specific, suggesting it may be a novel mechanism for hippocampal-dependent learning and memory...|$|E
40|$|The {{response}} of a neuron to a time-varying stimulus is influ-enced by both short- and long-term synaptic plasticity. Both {{these forms of}} plasticity produce changes in synaptic efficacy of similar magnitude on very different time scales. A full under-standing of the functional role of each form of plasticity relies on understanding how they interact. Here we examine how long-term potentiation (LTP) and short-term plasticity (STP) interact in two different cell types that exhibit NMDA-dependent LTP: neocortical L-II/III and hippocampal CA 1 pyramidal cells. STP was examined using both paired pulses and trains of pulses {{before and after the}} induction of LTP. In both cell types, the same pairing protocol was used to induce LTP in the presence of an <b>unpaired</b> control <b>pathway.</b> Pairing produced a robust increase in the amplitude of the first EPSP both in the neocortex and hippocampus. However, although in CA 1 neurons the sam...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe JAK/STAT {{signaling}} pathway, {{renowned for}} its effects on cell proliferation and survival, is constitutively active in various human cancers, including ovarian. We have found that JAK and STAT are required to convert the border cells in the Drosophila ovary from stationary, epithelial cells to migratory, invasive cells. The ligand for this <b>pathway,</b> <b>Unpaired</b> (UPD), is expressed by two central cells within the migratory cell cluster. Mutations in upd or jak cause defects in migration {{and a reduction in}} the number of cells recruited to the cluster. Ectopic expression of either UPD or JAK is sufficient to induce extra epithelial cells to migrate. Thus, a localized signal activates the JAK/STAT pathway in neighboring epithelial cells, causing them to become invasive...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDuring Drosophila eye development, {{localized}} Notch signaling at the dorsal ventral (DV) -midline promotes {{growth of}} the entire eye field. This long-range action of Notch signaling may be mediated through the diffusible ligand of the Jak/STAT <b>pathway,</b> <b>Unpaired</b> (Upd), which was recently identified as a downstream target of Notch. However, Notch activity has not {{been shown to be}} cell-autonomously required for Upd expression and therefore yet another diffusible signal may be required for Notch activation of Upd. Our results clarify the Notch requirement, demonstrating that Notch activity at the DV-midline leads to cell-autonomous expression of Upd as monitored in loss and gain-of-function Notch clones. In addition, mutations in the Jak/STAT pathway interact genetically with the Notch pathway by suppressing Notch mediated overgrowth. Nact clones show non-autonomous effects on the cell cycle anterior to the furrow, indicating function of the Jak/STAT pathway. However, cell-autonomous effects of Notch within and posterior to the furrow are independent of Upd. Here, Notch autonomously maintains cells in a proliferative state and blocks photoreceptor differentiation...|$|R
