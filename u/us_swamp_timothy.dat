50|$|Most wetland on the {{wildlife}} area are managed as seasonal wetlands. They {{go through an}} extensive dry period during {{the spring and summer}} months. Typically these ponds are drained April 1 to stimulate the germination of <b>Swamp</b> <b>Timothy.</b> They may receive a brief summer irrigation and then are flooded in September to provide wetland habitat for migratory waterfowl and shorebirds.|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to create baseline soil salinity maps using an electromagnetic device, Geonics' EM- 38. These soil salinity maps will be used to semi-quantitatively assess how the current soil salinity affects plant productivity and how micro-topography affects soil salinity. Based on these semi-quantitative analyses, recommendations on how to mitigate the high saline areas will be proposed to aid wetland managers in the management of these ponds. Given that the use of the EM- 38 in wildland and wetland systems is novel and innovative, notes and suggestions of procedures will be summarized in order to aid in future mapping efforts. It is hypothesized that the highest concentrations of salts will be in isolated depressions and areas of the pond that have higher elevation, both of which experience minimal water flows. The lowest concentrations of salts will be in areas with high water flow such as the swales. <b>Swamp</b> <b>timothy</b> productivity will be negatively affected with increasing soil salinity. A secondary objective is to investigate the ability of spectral reflectance values and various vegetation indices to predict <b>swamp</b> <b>timothy</b> seed productivity within the wetland study sites. The high resolution imagery, as described in section 1. 5. 1, will be used to explore these principles...|$|R
50|$|Crypsis schoenoides is {{a species}} of grass known by the common names <b>swamp</b> pricklegrass, <b>swamp</b> <b>timothy,</b> and cowpond grass. This grass is native to Europe but it is present in most other continents where it was {{introduced}} and took hold. This is an annual grass with purple-tinted green stems which forms mats and low clumps near water. It has wide-sheathed leaves and large sheaths that partially cover the inflorescences. The clublike inflorescence may exceed 4 centimeters in length and two in width. It is chunky and purple or purplish-green.|$|R
50|$|With the {{increased}} frequency and acreage of irrigated moist soil food plants {{there has been}} a doubling in desirable plant biomass, which equates to more high-quality, high energy food available to waterfowl. In some refuges waterfowl food production has increased tenfold. Timely de-watering and irrigation promote the germination and irrigation of important moist-soil food plants, such as <b>swamp</b> <b>timothy</b> and watergrass. These plants provide a high-energy food source through both their seeds and associated invertebrate communities. The increase in supply reliability allows wetland managers to lower water depths to make seeds and invertebrates available without the fear of having wetlands completely evaporate.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} project was to advance the concept of real-time water quality management in the San Joaquin Basin by developing an application to drainage of seasonal wetlands in the Grassland Water District. Real-time water quality management {{is defined as the}} coordination of reservoir releases, return flows and river diversions to improve water quality conditions in the San Joaquin River and ensure compliance with State water quality objectives. Real-time water quality management is achieved through information exchange and cooperation between shakeholders who contribute or withdraw flow and salt load to or from the San Joaquin River. This project complements a larger scale project that was undertaken by members of the Water Quality Subcommittee of the San Joaquin River Management Program (SJRMP) and which produced foreca sts of flow, salt load and San Joaquin River assimilative capacity between 1999 and 2003. These forecasts can help those entities exporting salt load to the River to develop salt load targets as a mechanism for improving compliance with salinity objectives. The mass balance model developed by this project is the decision support tool that helps to establish these salt load targets. A second important outcome of this project was the development and application of a methodology for assessing potential impacts of real-time wetland salinity management. Drawdown schedules are typically tied to weather conditions and are optimized in traditional practices to maximize food sources for over-wintering wildfowl as well as providing a biological control (through germination temperature) of undesirable weeds that compete with the more proteinaceous moist soil plants such as <b>swamp</b> <b>timothy,</b> watergrass and smartweed. This methodology combines high resolution remote sensing, ground-truthing vegetation surveys using established survey protocols and soil salinity mapping using rapid, automated electromagnetic sensor technology. This survey methodology could be complemented with biological surveys of bird use and invertebrates to produce a robust long-term monitoring strategy for habitat health and sustainability...|$|R

50|$|American {{manufacturers}} faced <b>US</b> markets <b>swamped</b> with British products, {{produced by}} low-paid workers and priced well below competitive rates and forcing many factories out of business. Continental Europe, its agrarian output crippled {{by the recent}} war, offered new markets for American staple crops, particularly cotton, wheat, corn and tobacco. As prices soared for agricultural goods, a speculative agrarian land boom ensued in the South and West United States, encouraged by liberal terms for government public land sales. “The entire postwar American economy” observed historian George Dangerfield was “based on a land boom”. The inflationary bubble grew from 1815 to 1818, obscuring the general deflationary trends in world prices.|$|R

Security concerns have also led to a substantial change in customs and inspection procedures for goods bound for the <b>US,</b> which could <b>swamp</b> tariffs {{in terms of their}} trade-inhibiting effect.
