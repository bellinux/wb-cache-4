6000|$|To {{show the}} means of the country to sustain even a much-increasing population, and that those means were in operation, he entered {{into one of the most}} {{original}} and interesting calculations that was perhaps ever offered to the House of Commons. Reminding the House that in the preceding year (1845) the farmers of England, at a cost of two millions sterling, had imported two hundred and eighty thousand tons of guano, he proceeded to estimate what would be the effect on the productive powers of the land of that novel application. Two hundred thousand tons, or, in other words, four million hundred-weight, were expended on the land in 1845. Half of these, he assumed, would be applied to the growth of wheat, and the other half to the growth of turnips preparatory to the wheat crop of the ensuing year. According to the experiments tried and recorded in the Royal Agricultural Journal, it would seem that by the application of two hundred-weight of guano to an acre of wheat land, the produce would be increased by one quarter per acre. At this rate, one hundred thousand tons, or two million hundred-weight of guano would add one million quarters of wheat to the crop, or bread for one year for one million of people. But as he was very careful never to over-state a case, Lord George assumed, that it would require three hundred hundredweight of guano to an acre to produce an extra quarter of wheat. According to this estimate, one hundred thousand tons of guano, applied to the land in 1845, must have added six hundred and sixty-six thousand six hundred and sixty-six quarters of grain to the wheat crop, or, in other words, bread for six hundred and sixty-six thousand six hundred and sixty-six additional mouths. 'And now for turnips,' he continued. The Norfolk authorities whom he quoted have in like manner proved that two hundred-weight of guano will add ten tons per acre to the turnip crop. But again, for fear of exaggeration, he supposed that three hundred-weight would be requisite to create such increased fertility. In this case, two million hundredweight of guano would add six million six hundred and sixty-six thousand six hundred and sixty tons to the natural <b>unmanured</b> produce of the crop. Now it is generally considered that one ton of Swedes would last twenty sheep three weeks, and that each sheep should gain half a pound of meat per week, or one pound and a half in three weeks; thus twenty sheep feeding on one ton of turnips in three weeks should in the aggregate make, as the graziers say, thirty pounds of mutton. But to be safe in his estimate, he would assume that one ton of turnips makes only half this quantity. 'Multiply, then,' exclaimed Bentinck with the earnest air of a crusader, 'six million six hundred and sixty-six thousand six hundred and sixty by fifteen, and you have no less than ninety-nine million nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand and nine hundred pounds of mutton as the fruits of one hundred thousand tons of guano; which, at ninety-two pounds per man--the average Englishman's allowance--affords meat for one million eight hundred and sixty thousand nine hundred and fifty-five--nearly two million of her Majesty's subjects.' ...|$|E

Walp) Var moussa local to root-knot nematode infection caused by Meloidogyne javanica was tested in a replicated pot experiment. Manured plants were inoculated with 2000 eggs of M. javanica while uninoculated manured plants served as control for each manure type and <b>unmanured</b> but inoculated plants as general control. The result showed that <b>unmanured</b> and inoculated plants were susceptible to M. javanica to varying degrees.

Knowledge of the impact of agronomic practices such as manuring on the stability, for example resistance and resilience, of heterotrophic C- CO 2 respiration to disturbance is scarce. Here, we studied the stability of soil microbial heterotrophic respiration of two tropical soils from plots annually enriched or not with manure applications during more than 20 years. Stability was quantified after heating soils artificially. We hypothesized that field manuring would change the stability of the microbial community. Additionally, the impact of both manured and <b>unmanured</b> soils to addition of an organic cocktail was assessed under controlled conditions in order to discriminate the metabolic capacity of the microbial community, and to link the metabolic capacity up with the microbial heterotrophic soil respiration. Our results show that total respiration was not significantly different in manured and <b>unmanured</b> pots. Moreover, contrary to our hypothesis, manure amendment did not affect the stability (resistance, resilience) of the microbial abundance or the basal metabolism, in our experimental conditions. By contrast, the diversity of the bacterial community in heated soils was different from that in unheated soils. After heating, surviving microorganisms showed different carbon utilization efficiency, manuring stimulating the growth of different resistant communities, that is, r-strategist or Kstrategist. Microbial community of manured soils developed in the presence of the organic cocktail was less resistant to heating than microbial community of <b>unmanured</b> plots. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} subsoil {{loosening}} to c. 35 cm depth was studied in an organic crop rotation experiment at Flakkebjerg (sandy loam) and Foulum (loamy sand). In {{each of the}} years 2000 - 2003 half of 4 plots per site was loosened in the autumn in a young grass-clover. Penetration resistance was recorded yearly. Detailed soil physical properties were determined for the Foulum site in 2003. Aboveground winter wheat growth was followed during the 2002 / 03 growing season using spectral reflectance measurements. Root growth was followed during the 2002 / 03 growing season at Foulum using the minirhizotron technique. Crop yield was determined every year in all treated plots. The Paraplow treatment effectively loosened the plough pan. Loosening in the grass-clover crop resulted in reduced growth. Apparently, this unintended effect of loosening had marked effects on {{the growth of the}} succeeding winter wheat crop. In wet years, yields were lowest in loosened and <b>unmanured</b> soil. In a dry year, loosening resulted in increased yield at Flakkebjerg. This appears to be an effect of the grass-clover crop that interferes with the results of loosening. Generally, our results suggest that under Danish conditions subsoil loosening can only be recommended in case of very severe subsoil compaction. ...|$|E

The treatments were five tillage methods: manual clearing (MC), manual ridging (MR), manual mounding (MM), ploughing plus harrowing (P+H) and ploughing plus harrowing twice (P+ 2 H) and five poultry manure (PM) levels: 0. 0, 2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 5 and 10. 0 t/ha). These were factorially combined and arranged in a randomized complete block design and replicated three times. In 2008, P+H had highest leaf N, P, K Ca and Mg, but in 2009, MC had the highest while P+ 2 H had the least. In the first 2 years (2007 & 2008), MR, MM and P+H increased cocoyam growth and corm yield compared with MC, but in 2009, MC had highest growth and yield of cocoyam and P+ 2 H had the least. Irrespective of tillage method, leaf K, Ca, Mg, plant height, leaf area and corm yield of cocoyam only increased up to 7. 5 t/ha PM, although leaf N and P increased up to 10. 0 t/ha PM.

First fallow was established in randomized complete blocks with three replicates. At harvesting, biomass was recorded, then either incorporated in situ or transferred to continuous cropped plots split with and without added P fertiliser and monitored for the effect in improving consecutive maize crops. The second fallow was managed on this split plot design. The two-planted shrubs fallows produced more than 9 Mg total dry biomass and accumulated 154 to 234 kg N. ha- 1, which were significantly higher compared to the production in the natural fallow. The shrubs were also superior to natural fallow for P accumulation (5 - 22 kg versus 2 kg. ha- 1). The aboveground dry biomass harvested from planted T. vogelii and T. diversifolia and either incorporated in situ or transferred into continuously cropped plots increased maize yields by 2. 5 folds compared to the <b>unmanured</b> crop, the control.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to assess the {{influences}} of various methods of cultivating and making use of permanent grasslands in respect of their surface structure and productivity. At {{the same time we}} {{have to take into account}} the production and extra-production importance of permanent grasslands. That is affected by exploiting different pratotechnic methods (mowing, grazing, alternate ways of cultivation, absence of cultivation) which have an effect on the formation of vegetation structure of the grass growth. One of the consequent aspects is also fytocenologic and production characteristics of the grass growth. In the work there are also methods of assessment and classification of space types and the summary of the most widespread ones mentioned. The earning capability of various growth types and proper methods of their exploiting is also an important part of the work. Permanent grasslands are main component of fodder for livestock, and throught them we can make livestock farming more effective. For the best quality and profit of grasslands is necessary proper preparing a land, mainly by manuring and mulching. Well manured grasslands give higher crop yield than <b>unmanured.</b> Crop yield also dependson climatic conditions and soil qualities. Plant and grass biomass presents materials of identical origin, which can be used in various branches of agriculture and industry. Using appropriate pratotechnic procedures, corresponding with ecological and economical conditions, we can expect high-quality yield. Combination of mowing and grazing appears as the most convenient utilization of grasslands.

40|$|Persistence of the soyabean rhizobial {{inoculant}} strain MAR 1491 {{was assessed}} in 52 soils from Guruve, Hurungwe and Goromonzi districts of Zimbabwe, {{which had been}} inoculated 1 ¿ 4 or 6 years previously. Most probable number estimates of rhizobia in the soils showed that population sizes decreased with increasing time since the last inoculation. Rhizobial populations of up to 102 cells g¿ 1 soil were found in Guruve soils inoculated 3 years before, while persistence in Hurungwe and Goromonzi soils was significant for soils inoculated 2 years before. The greater rhizobial persistence in Guruve soils was attributed to their higher clay (> 20 %) and organic C (> 1 %) compared with the sandier, relatively less fertile Hurungwe and Goromonzi soils. Farmers with favourable soils {{such as those in}} Guruve can grow soyabean for at least 3 years without the need for repeat inoculation. Manure application led to increased indigenous rhizobial numbers at two smallholder sites and larger numbers of rhizobia in inoculated plots in sandy soils from Goromonzi. Inoculation and manure addition increased rhizobial numbers and soyabean yields in field experiments; soyabean yields varied from 0. 5 t ha¿ 1 in uninoculated, <b>unmanured</b> plots to 1. 1 t ha¿ 1 in inoculated plots receiving 10 t manure ha¿ 1. Increases in numbers closely followed the progress of the wet season.

40|$|Coal-fired power {{generation}} and agriculture {{account for more}} than half of global greenhouse gas emissions, but the coal fly ash (CFA) produced in the former can be a resource for reducing emissions from agriculture to minimise environmental footprints in both industries. Our aim in this study was to test how acidic and alkaline CFA addition could minimise loss of C and N from acidic soil, with or without added manure. We determined composition and structural characteristics of acidic and alkaline CFA for their capacity to adsorb organic carbon, but observed poor adsorption because of low concentrations of cenospheres and unburnt carbon as the primary absorbents in the ash. Addition of CFA had no impact on the loss of carbon or nitrogen from <b>unmanured</b> soil in which concentrations of these nutrients were low. Loss of carbon from manured soil was reduced by 36 % with alkaline ashes and by 3 -fold with acidic ashes; while loss of N was 30 – 50 % lower with acidic ashes, but 28 % higher with alkaline ashes, compared with no ash treatment. The increases in C sparing with CFA addition were achieved not by direct C absorption but by restraining microbial population and respiration, and potentially emissions. Alkaline CFA increased soil pH and if used to substitute just 10 % of lime for ameliorating soil acidity would reduce CO 2 emission associated with the mining of the lime and its eventual dissolution in soil by ~ 2. 66 Tg or 2. 8 % of Australia’s annual agricultural emissions. High concentrations of oxides of phosphorus, silicon, titanium and clay particles in acidic ashes, and oxides of cations in alkaline ashes, were associated with potential for promoting C storage and acidity amelioration in soil...|$|E
40|$|An {{incubation}} {{experiment on}} straw decomposition {{was carried out}} with soils from a long-term field trial at Therwil, Switzerland. Two conventional agricultural systems, one with (CONFYM) and one without manure, an organic system managed according to bio-dynamic farming practice (BIODYN) and an unfertilized control were compared. CONFYM received stacked manure and an additional mineral fertilizer. BIODYN received composted farmyard manure and no mineral fertilizers. Both systems received {{the same amount of}} manure based on 1. 4 livestock units haˇ 1. The aim of the investigation was to explain the large differences in soil microbial biomass and activity between the systems, especially between the manured soils. Di€erences in microbial C-utilization effciency were suggested to be the main reason. We followed the decomposition of 14 C-labeled plant material over a period of 177 days under controled incubation conditions. Prior to incubation, microbial biomass was 75 % higher and qCO 2 up to 43 % lower in the BIODYN soil than in the conventional soils. At the end of the incubation period, 58 % of the applied plant material was mineralized to CO 2 in the BIODYN soil compared to 50 % in the other soils. This difference became signifcant 2 weeks after application of plant material and is suggested to be due to decomposition of more recalcitrant compounds. After addition of plant material, the increase of microbial biomass in the <b>unmanured</b> systems was higher than in the manured systems, but with a higher loss rate thereafter. The amount of 14 C incorporated into Cmic as related to 14 CO 2 evolved was markedly higher in the BIODYN soil. The results support the hypothesis that agricultural measures applied to the BIODYN system invoke a higher efciency of the soil microbial community with respect to substrate use for growth...|$|E
40|$|Nitrogen is {{essential}} to plant growth and biomass production. Thus, it is often the primary focus in agricultural literature. The nitrogen cycle is complex in terrestrial systems mainly because it takes various forms - occurring in all chemical phases and mediated by both biotic and abiotic processes. The first chapter of {{this study examined the}} nitrogen cycle in its entirety as it relates to corn production in Iowa. Ultimately, this study was a proof-of-concept illustrating the possibility of adaptive nitrogen fertilization through the use of model simulation and improved VNIR and GIS technologies. The next two chapters focused more specifically on gaseous nitrous oxide production in traditionally manured agroecosystems and potential interactions with carbon quality and quantity through the use of cover crops. Significant differences were found in the N 2 O emissions profiles between manured (M) and <b>unmanured</b> (NM) soils with a simultaneous increasing trend in emissions with increasing fertilizer applications. M soils produced 53 -, 15. 5 - and 8. 6 -fold increases in N 2 O emissions over NM soils. Furthermore, on manured soils this study found that nitrous oxide emissions in cover crop treatments (winter rye and oats) showed no significant difference over a control plot during the early spring season. However, as ambient temperatures warmed, winter rye was found to decrease average N 2 O emissions by approximately 70 % when compared to either the oat or fallow treatment. Additionally, nitrate concentrations found in leachate at 55 cm were dramatically lower in rye plots, while the winter-killed oat showed no decrease in nitrate concentrations when compared to a control. The final chapter concludes with a study on nitrogen mineralization in a Kenyan chronosequence amended with organic materials (Maize (MA) and Faidherbia albida (FA)). Mineralization patterns followed a similar trend in soils from a recent (New) and much older conversion (Old) to agriculture. Average mineralization in FA amended soils was 4. 31 % greater than the Control in the New soil and 0. 75 % in the Old soil during mineralization phases.

Soil samples were therefore collected from a fertilizer response trial on oil palm to study the spatial inorganic N distribution and some selected soil chemical properties as affected by long-term N fertilizer applications. The experiment was conducted on mature oil palms grown on Kumansi family (Typic Paleudults) soil in Tawau, Sabah, Malaysia. The soil samples were taken from 2 areas; with and without N treatments for 8 years. They were analyzed for total N, NH 4 + -N, NO 3 - -N, exchangeable K, and pH. Semivariance {{analysis was used to}} characterize the spatial variance of soil NH 4 + -N and NO 3 - -N while point kriging method was used to illustrate their spatial distributions. Results showed that application of N in the palm circle increased soil NH 4 + -N above 150 mg kg - 1 at 0 to 15 cm depth. In <b>unmanured</b> plot, the NH 4 + -N contents were similar in the different sites within a palm area although the frond heap area tended to have higher NH 4 + -N probably due to the N return from the decaying cut fronds. The coefficient of variations for both soil NH 4 + -N and NO 3 - -N exceeded 30 % even within each microsite of palm circle, interrow, frond heaps, and harvesting path. Semivariance analysis showed that the maximum range of soil NH 4 + -N could be reached at 10 m and 90 m in areas with and without N respectively, indicating that the application of N fertilizer reduced its spatial variability in mature oil palm agroecosystem. The kriged soil map showed localized spots of high NH 4 + -N content, which corresponded to the palm circles where N fertilizer was applied. Gradual changes in soil fertility were observed in area without N, moving from northern to southern portion of the field. Long-term applications of N caused significant downward movement of NH 4 + -N and NO 3 - -N to the lower soil depth. They also decreased the soil pH from 4. 2 to 3. 7, and caused leaching of K to the lower depth. Fertilizer should be broadcast in the interrow in mature oil palm agroecosystem to reduce spatial N variation and other detrimental effects...|$|E
40|$|Nitrogen (N) {{tied up in}} or {{lost from}} decomposing biomass {{decreases}} the residual N effects of green manure and of other crop residues. During anaerobic degradation in a biogas digestor (biodigestion), N mineralization takes place under conditions in which losses can be kept to a minimum. Therefore, biodigestion of green manure biomass and beet foliage was tested to generate readily available N and compared with a direct green manure fertilization system. The effluent was applied as fertilizer in field experiments on a sandy soil {{as a tool for}} improving N supply for an organic farming system. Data from the field experiments were used for simulating the amount of net inorganic N equivalents (inorganic N equivalents from effluent plus inorganic N equivalents from pre-crops) in three crop sequences: A) green manure ley, red beets, winter rye; B) harvested ley, red beets, winter rye; and C) harvested ley, spring barley, red beets in which (B) and (C) represented biogas nutrient management systems and (A) a green manure system. When all available effluent from biogas production from 1 ha of grass–clover ley with two or three harvests (2 H-ley or 3 H-ley) and one hectare of beet foliage was used as a fertilizer for red beets (Beta vulgaris var. conditiva Alef) after barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), the yield of marketable red beets increased by 5. 7 Mg·ha– 1 (33 %) with effluent from 2 H-ley and beet foliage and 9. 1 Mg·ha– 1 (53 %) with effluent from 3 H-ley and beet foliage compared with red beets grown without effluent fertilization after a green manure ley. When total dry matter production was taken into account, the advantage for the BG systems with 2 H- and 3 H-ley was 15 % and 28 %, respectively. The nitrate concentration in the red beets was not higher with effluent supplied at this level than with green manure as the only N source. The simulated amount of net inorganic N equivalents was 128 kg N for the whole of crop sequence (C) with 1 ha of each crop and where effluent supply to red beets was based on digested biomass in ley and beet tops. The corresponding amount of net inorganic N equivalents for the green manure crop sequence (A), in which no effluent was supplied, was 73 kg N. Unused soil mineral N (0 - to 90 -cm depth) at red beet harvest indicated that the risk of leaching in BG systems was lower than in GrM systems (88, 76, and 61 kg Nmin/ha left after <b>unmanured</b> beets after Gr-M-ley, low manured beets after 3 H-ley and high manured beets after barley, respectively). Effluent fertilization of red beets directly after 2 H- and 3 H-ley gave unexpectedly low yield responses compared with red beets after barley. The reasons {{may be the result of}} nutritional imbalance of other nutrients than N or may be plant pathological in nature. The conclusion is that a nutrient management system with biodigestion can increase net inorganic N equivalents and reduce risk for N leaching, but inappropriate use of the effluent, i. e., at an unsuitable point in the crop rotation, may negate the benefits...|$|E
40|$|Introduction The bread making {{potential}} of wheat flour is largely {{related to the}} gluten protein. It has until now been stated that the genotype (cultivar) {{is the most important}} factor for the gluten properties and protein composition, whereas environmental factor like fertilisation has a great impact on the quantity of gluten proteins (Daniel and Triboi, 2000). In organic farming, {{there seems to be a}} stronger interaction between genotype and environment on the gluten properties and the baking properties, due to the restricted nutrient availability. Therefore, the influence of environmental factors, and especially the influence of fertilisation in organic farming must be investigated in order to grow organic bread wheat with good quality. The importance o the wheat gluten is due to its unique viscoelastic properties. Rheological characterisation of the gluten protein network is essential to explain differences due to genotype and/or environmental factors. The dynamic rheological parameters (G', G", and d) differ between cultivars with good and poor bread making quality. Differences in rheological parameters are mainly related to the ratio between the gliadins and glutenins (Khatkar et al., 1995, 2002). As some environmental factors influence this ratio, fundamental rheological testing may be valid for the testing of the influence of environmental factors on the gluten properties. Experiments At The Askov Long-term Experiments on Animal Manure and Mineral Fertilizer, an organic farming workshop was established in 1996 with the aim to study the influence of the nutrients. Three nutrients levels are compared with <b>unmanured</b> treatments. The spring wheat cultivar Vinjett was grown with application of two organic manures, slurry (GY) and liquid manure (FG), in three N-levels (0, 75, and 150 kg N/Ha). Additionally, FG was added at 225 kg N/Ha. Wheat grain was milled, and the gluten was isolated using a Glutomatic 2100 (ICC standard 137). The gluten was measured in oscillation in a frequency range of 0. 05 Hz to 20 Hz. The stress amplitude was 100 Pa. Results Frequency sweeps from two samples are shown in Figure 1. In the gluten elastic behaviour is dominating. The modulus G' and G" increased for increasing frequency. The slope (log G'/log w) was slightly different for the two samples, 0. 20 for the sample with no manure added, and 0. 22 with liquid manure (75 kg N/Ha). However, the phase angle d increased with increasing frequency up to 20 Hz. Increasing levels of N increased the gluten content of the flour (Fig. 2.). Application of liquid manure resulted in higher gluten contents at all N-levels. The viscoelastic behaviour of gluten in relation to type of manure and level of N is shown in Figure 3. The modulus seemed to be influenced by the type of manure, and by the level of N. There was a small increase in G' and G" when N-level was increased from 0 to 75 kg N/Ha for liquid manure (FG), and similar for the slurry (GY) between 75 and 150 kg N/Ha. N-levels beyond these values decreased G' and G". At the lowest N-level (75 kg N/Ha), there was a difference in G' and G" between the two types of manure. The N-level had no effect on d for the slurry, whereas a slightly increase in d was observed for the liquid manure. These results indicate, that the type and level of manure have an impact on the amount of gluten protein and the viscoelastic properties of gluten. The variability in the moduli in relation to N-management is probably explained by differences in the protein composition, and mainly the ratio gliadins/glutenins (Khatkar et. al., 1995, 2002) Conclusions Oscillatory measurements of gluten from one wheat cultivar with different application of manures indicated that type of manure, and the level of N influenced the viscoelastic properties of gluten. Thus, measurements of G', G" and d may be valid in the studies of the influence of growth conditions on the baking quality of wheat. References Daniel, C. and Triboi, E. 2000.

Winter feeding hay and straw directly on pasture is a potentially more efficient and economical system compared to conventional drylot feeding in a yard. The objectives of the research described in this thesis were to compare winter feeding cattle directly on pasture to traditional drylot over-wintering of cattle and the associated mechanized spreading of manure on pasture. This trial compared the effects of winter feeding systems on pasture nutrient distribution, nutrient recovery in soil and forage, pasture forage response, cattle performance, and economics. The experiment was conducted at Lanigan, SK, on an old russian wildrye grass pasture. Pasture nutrient levels and distribution were measured before and after winter feeding, as well as forage yield, and cattle weight and condition. Nutrient capture and cycling was assessed along with {{the economics of the}} different systems. In the pasture fed systems, cattle were fed by either bale processing or bale grazing methods over the winter of 2003 - 2004. Cattle concentration was 2080 cow-days ha- 1, with the cattle in the field for 130 d. In the intensive system used for comparison, cattle were fed in a drylot and 67 tonnes ha- 1 of raw manure or 22 tonnes ha- 1 of compost was mechanically spread on the pasture in the fall of 2003. Soil inorganic nitrogen (N) levels (0 - 15 cm) measured in the spring where the cattle were winter fed on pasture were 3 to 4 times the unfertilized, <b>unmanured</b> control treatment, with a mean gain of 117 kg N ha- 1. Soil inorganic N was not significantly elevated where manure or compost had been spread by machine. Soil extractable potassium (K) was doubled on the winter feeding sites, with a mean gain of 1209 kg K ha- 1. Soil extractable K did not increase where manure or compost had been spread mechanically. Soil distribution patterns of both nutrients were highly uneven following pasture feeding, with levels of inorganic soil N ranging from 12 to 626 kg ha- 1 and extractable soil K ranging from 718 to 6326 kg ha- 1. Additional nutrients in surface residue from uneaten feed, bedding, and manure were also heavy and variable following pasture feeding. Greater retention of N and K from urine added directly to the soil in the field in the bale grazing and bale processing systems compared to the drylot system is believed to be responsible for high soil available N and K levels compared to manure hauled from the drylot into the field. Soil extractable phosphorus (P) levels (0 - 15 cm) were measured in the fall of 2005. The compost treatment had the largest increase at 2. 6 times the control, an additional 46 kg ha- 1. Mean soil P levels did not increase significantly where the cattle were wintered. Over 18 months and 3 harvests, forage dry matter yields where the cattle were fed on pasture were 3 to 5 times the control where the cattle were fed on the pasture, and 1. 4 to 1. 7 times the control where raw manure or compost was mechanically spread. Also, protein content of the forage was increased to a greater extent in the in-field feeding compared to hauled raw manure or compost, reflecting a greater conservation of N. The gain of N in the forage over 18 months on the winter feeding sites was 200 kg ha- 1 of N, almost double what was measured in soil inorganic forms. Fourteen kg ha- 1 of P was also recovered. This represented 34 % of original feed N and 22 % of original feed P that was imported into the field. Recovery of nutrients applied in the raw manure and compost sites was much lower, with only 7 % recovery of N and 4 % recovery of P in the forage. This was calculated to be 1 % of original feed N and 3 % of original feed P. The system by which the cattle were overwintered had little influence on cattle weight and condition. All systems performed favorably in maintaining body weight and condition over the winter. Some slight advantages in cattle weight gain and condition were found on the winter feeding systems compared to the in-yard drylot that appeared to be related to slightly increased feed intake. Economic calculations favored winter feeding directly on the pasture by 25 % over the drylot systems when the feed value of additional pasture growth over 18 months was included and by 56 % when the value of additional soil nutrients was factored in. Feed costs were similar between the systems but pasture feeding had savings in machinery use, fuel consumption and manure handling costs, and gains in pasture productivity. Systems that winter fed cattle directly on pasture provided gains in nutrient cycling efficiencies, pasture growth, and economic savings compared to drylot feeding systems, while maintaining similar cattle growth and condition...|$|E
