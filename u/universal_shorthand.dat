25|$|Modern-looking {{geometric}} shorthand {{was introduced}} with John Byrom's New <b>Universal</b> <b>Shorthand</b> of 1720. Samuel Taylor published a similar system in 1786, the first English shorthand {{system to be}} used all over the English-speaking world. Thomas Gurney published Brachygraphy in the mid-18th century. In 1834 in Germany, Franz Xaver Gabelsberger published his Gabelsberger shorthand. Gabelsberger based his shorthand on the shapes used in German cursive handwriting {{rather than on the}} geometrical shapes that were common in the English stenographic tradition.|$|E
50|$|Byrom {{invented a}} system of {{shorthand}} and, having perfected this, returned to England in 1716. Some of the inhabitants of Manchester tried {{to persuade him to}} set up a medical practice in the town, but he decided that his abilities were insufficient to pursue a medical career and resolved to teach his shorthand system instead. Shortly after coming into his family inheritance in 1740, he patented his New <b>Universal</b> <b>Shorthand.</b> This system of shorthand, officially taught at both Oxford and Cambridge Universities, was used by the clerk of the House of Lords.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: {{experimentally}} {{to check}} up possibility and efficiency of application of operative cars of <b>universal</b> speed <b>shorthand</b> records of unknown roads crews. Materials and Methods: theoretical analysis and generalization, pedagogical supervisions, pedagogical experiment, methods of mathematical statistics. In research took part 20 professional crews road patrol State Automobile Inspectorate, in all 40 persons, up-diffused on 2 groups for 10 crews: experimental and control. Results: application of methods of <b>universal</b> speed <b>shorthand</b> record of СД an experimental group allowed to shorten time-of-flight of segment of control distance on 7, 37 %. Conclusion: the results of pedagogical experiment at participation of professional crews road patrol State Automobile Inspectorate on official cars in the contention terms of the real route testify to possibility and efficiency of application of operative cars of the special setting of <b>universal</b> speed <b>shorthand</b> records of unknown roads crews during their professional activity...|$|R
50|$|His {{system of}} {{shorthand}} was posthumously published as The <b>Universal</b> English <b>Shorthand</b> which, although superseded {{in the nineteenth}} century, marked a significant development {{in the history of}} shorthand. It was used by John (1703-1791) and Charles Wesley (1707-1788), founders of Methodism, who recorded their self-examinations in coded diaries.|$|R
40|$|A {{universal}} cycle for the k-permutations of 〈n 〉 = { 1, 2, [...] ., n} is {{a circular}} string of length nk that contains each k-permutation exactly once as a substring. Jackson (Discrete Mathematics, 149 (1996) 123 – 129) proved their existence for all k ≤ n − 1. Knuth (The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 4, Fascicle 2, Addison-Wesley, 2005) {{pointed out the}} importance of the k = n − 1 case, where each (n − 1) -permutation is “shorthand ” for exactly one permutation of 〈n〉. Ruskey-Williams (ACM Transactions on Algorithms, in press) answered Knuth’s request for an explicit construction of a <b>shorthand</b> <b>universal</b> cycle for permutations, and gave an algorithm that creates successive symbols in worst-case O(1) -time. This paper provides two new algorithmic constructions that create successive blocks of n symbols in O(1) amortized time within an array of length n. The constructions are based on a 300 year-old bell-ringer pattern, and the recent shift Gray code by Williams (SODA, (2009) 987 - 996) and are both implemented in C. For the bell-ringers algorithm, we show that the majority of changes between successive permutations are full rotations; asymptotically, the ratio of them is (n − 2) /n...|$|R
