40|$|Accurate and {{reliable}} prediction of project performance {{is critical to}} the success of construction projects and companies alike. Such prediction assists in obtaining early warnings against potential problems. Existing project performance forecasting models are fragmented, especially regarding the consideration of interdependency between multidimensional performance indicators. To address these limitations, a system dynamics (SD) model was developed to simulate the complexities that exist among interdependent variables and forecast their dynamics over time. The proposed model integrates eight construction project performance indices, which have been identified through literature review and interviews with domain experts. Performance dimensions include cost, schedule, quality, profitability, safety, environment, team satisfaction, and client satisfaction. This model focuses on the construction phase of projects under <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> <b>contracts</b> and is intended for use by contractors. The model was tested on a road construction project to assess its practicality and accuracy. Results demonstrate general agreement between actual and forecasted performance indices. The model was also used to simulate four possible intervention scenarios by the project manager. Results of various scenarios show overall agreement with expected impacts of the interventions.

40|$|<b>Unit</b> <b>price</b> <b>contracting</b> is a {{standard}} contracting method for transportation projects. In such contracts, State Department of Transportation (DOT) estimators prepare an Engineer’s estimate of construction cost, {{which is used to}} compare the bids received and select the winning bid. This Engineer’s estimate is mostly dependent on historical bid data available from projects completed by the DOT in the past and experience of an estimator. The estimators adjust the <b>unit</b> <b>prices</b> of construction cost items to reflect project characteristics such as size, quantity of material, location etc. The historical data available to estimators contain <b>unit</b> <b>prices</b> of major construction cost items for some geographic locations where projects have been recently completed. However, the location of an upcoming project is highly likely to be different from any locations of recently completed projects. Hence, the estimator must use <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> data of different project locations to estimate <b>unit</b> <b>prices</b> for an upcoming project at a new location. The reliability of such estimate is questionable since there is no clearly defined procedure or methodology or technique that the estimators may use to adjust <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> for new locations. Geospatial interpolation is a promising method for quantifying the <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> for new locations from known values at various locations. The platform of geographic information systems (GIS) has tools for powerful spatial interpolation using techniques like inverse distance weighting (IDW), kriging, spline, natural neighbor, etc. In this study, the <b>unit</b> <b>prices</b> of five major highway construction pay items from the locational bid data obtained from Iowa Department of Transportation are visualized in GIS environment and spatially interpolated across the geographical map of Iowa using IDW. The difference in estimated and interpolated values of input points gives the error in interpolation and the average error is used to compare the interpolation techniques. Various factors are employed in the techniques to improve the resulting interpolation surface. Lower average error signifies the interpolation surface is better for that particular cost item. The geo-statistical interpolation methods have an interactive layer, which can be used to obtain a <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> at any location by just clicking on that location. Other than acting as a tool to quantify <b>unit</b> <b>prices</b> GIS platform is used to identify best parameters for each item, which improve the <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> interpolation.

The prospect of future interaction creates an incentive for the buyer to pay the supplier as promised. We characterize optimal price-only and price-and-quantity promises and compare their performance.

Many formats of nonlinear <b>pricing</b> <b>contract</b> have been proposed to achieve vertical channel coordination. Examples include two-part tariff and quantity discount. A two-part tariff charges the downstream party a fixed fee for participation and a uniform <b>unit</b> <b>price.</b> A quantity discount contract does not include a fixed fee and charges a lower <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> for each additional unit. Extant economic theories predict these contracts, when chosen optimally, to be revenue and division equivalent in that they all restore full channel effciency and give the same surplus to the upstream party assuming constant relative bargaining power.

Surprisingly, both pricing formats fail to coordinate the channel even in a well-controlled market environment with subjects motivated by significant monetary incentives. The observed channl effciencies were significantly lower than 100 %. In fact, they are statistically no better than that of the linear wholesale <b>price</b> <b>contract.</b> Revenue equivalence fails because the quantity discount scheme achieves a higher channel effciency than the two-part tariff.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the pricing {{behavior of a}} risk-averse monopolistic firm under demand uncertainty. The firm produces a single good at a constant marginal cost. To facilitate sales, the firm uses a two-part <b>pricing</b> <b>contract</b> that includes a membership fee and a selling <b>price</b> per <b>unit.</b> The good is sold to a continuum of heterogeneous consumers who are subject to a common demand shock. We show that the global and marginal effects of risk aversion are to push the <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> closer to the constant marginal cost, and to shrink the market coverage so as to limit the firm's risk exposure to the demand uncertainty. The more risk-averse firm as such charges a higher membership fee to consumers. We further show that {{an increase in the}} fixed cost of production induces the firm to lower (raise) the <b>unit</b> <b>price,</b> to raise (lower) the membership fee, and to shrink (enlarge) the market coverage under decreasing (increasing) absolute risk aversion. The firm's optimal two-part <b>pricing</b> <b>contract,</b> however, is unaffected by changes in the fixed cost under constant absolute risk aversion. Finally, we show that a mean-preserving-spread increase in the demand uncertainty induces the firm to lower the <b>unit</b> <b>price,</b> to raise the membership fee, and to shrink the market coverage under either decreasing or constant absolute risk aversion. The firm's risk preferences as such play a pivotal role in determining the optimal two-part pricing under demand uncertainty...|$|R
40|$|Building {{contractors}} are often commissioned using <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> based <b>contracts.</b> They, nevertheless, often compete {{on the basis}} of their overall project bids and yet are paid {{on the basis of}} these projectsâ constituent item prices. If a contractor decides these prices by way of applying an uneven mark-up to their estimates of their costs, this is known as unbalanced bidding. This research provides proof and explanation that different item pricing scenarios produce different levels of reward for a contractor, whilst exposing them to different degrees of risk. The theory describes the three identified sources of these rewards as well as provides the first explanation of the risks. It has identified the three types of risk involved and provides a model by which both the rewards as well as these risks can now be measured given any item pricing scenario. The research has included a study of the mainstream microeconomic techniques of Modern Portfolio Theory, Value-at-Risk, as well as Cumulative Prospect Theory that are all suited to making decisions that involve trading-off prospective rewards against risk. These techniques are then incorporated into a model that serves to identify the one item pricing combination that will produce the optimum value of utility as will be best suited to a contractorâs risk profile. The research has included the development of software written especially for this purpose in Java so that this theory could be tested on a hypothetical project.

40|$|Purpose - This paper aims {{to first}} {{investigate}} how <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> affects consumers’ grocery purchase decisions {{and perceptions of}} the shopping task’s information load. The second goal is to test how time pressure enhances the behavioural and perceptual effects of displaying <b>unit</b> <b>prices.</b> Design/methodology/approach - Two on-line experiments were conducted using national samples of shoppers. In Study 1, participants indicated their choices and perceptions in an inter-brand shopping scenario where prepackaged products have conflicting positions on retail <b>price</b> and <b>unit</b> <b>price.</b> In Study 2, participants conducted the same shopping task but now under a condition of time pressure. Findings - Study 1 shows that <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> shifts consumer choices towards the lower <b>unit</b> <b>priced</b> options and improves their perceptions of task information load. Study 2 shows that when consumers are under time pressure, <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> shows stronger effects on choices but not on perceptions. Research limitations/implications - The study comprised a fairly homogenous set of low involvement categories and relatively small assortments in a hypothetical purchase setting. Exploration {{of the role of}} <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> in more complex and more realistic purchase environments pose suitable avenues for future research. Practical implicationsThis study shows that consumers benefit from <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> because it makes it easier for them to find the lower <b>unit</b> <b>priced</b> items and to more quickly complete their shopping task. Retailers will benefit from increased customer satisfaction and possibly an improved store image. Social implications - The study shows that consumers generally benefit from the presence of <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> and that <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> information does not create harmful effects in terms of increasing their information load. Originality/value - This study uses a specifically designed and controlled but nevertheless realistic grocery choice task to study the effects of <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> in an inter-brand context where there are only small differences in size and price.

Using data from twelve cities over four years, per dozen retail egg prices in Grade A large and medium sizes were compared to the equivalent per ounce <b>unit</b> <b>price.</b> The {{results show that the}} per ounce <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> would not present the consumer with more informative price information than was presented by traditional methods of pricing...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> structure, <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> descriptions, and <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> sequence on the demand for money in humans. Six groups of 3 participants solved multiplication problems in exchange for money under various <b>unit</b> <b>prices.</b> Consumption of money decreased as the <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> increased across all conditions. However, the data also showed that: (a) fixed price structures produced slightly more elastic demand than did variable price structures, (b) price descriptions produced more elastic demand under variable price structures but {{had little or no}} effect under fixed price structures, and (c) the alternate sequence used with fixed price structures produced slightly more elastic demand...|$|R
5000|$|The {{benefits}} of <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> {{have been widely}} reported in the literature. It {{has been argued that}} <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> reduces time spent comparing brands, eliminates confusion relating to price calculations and ultimately allows shoppers to save money at the register. <b>Unit</b> <b>pricing</b> enables the consumers to rationally evaluate the most economic package size and brand. Accordingly, the time spent determining the most economic purchase is condensed substantially, errors in product price comparisons are significantly reduced, and importantly, lower grocery shopping expenditure is attained. [...] In Australia, despite having <b>unit</b> <b>pricing</b> legislation, there were no adequate education programs to enable consumers to take advantage of <b>unit</b> <b>pricing.</b>|$|R
