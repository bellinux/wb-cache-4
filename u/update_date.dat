The back end functions are typically performed in two steps: conversion of analog RF inputs into IF bands (see Table 2), and conversion of IF bands into channelized digital data streams (see Tables 1 a, 1 b and 1 c). The latter IF systems are now completely digital and generically referred to as digital back ends (DBEs).

The present paper describes four datasets, {{all of which were}} derived from a larger collection of personal websites: (1) a large corpus of raw text data from Geocities personal homepages, (2) a linguistic analysis of basic psychological properties of the same Geocities pages, using an open-source implementation of the Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC), (3) a dataset of links between homepages (suitable for network analysis), and (4) a manifest dataset summarizing the size and last <b>update</b> <b>date</b> for each file in the dataset.

40|$|ABSTRACT The Pesquisa Nacional sobre Acesso, Utilização e Promoção do Uso Racional de Medicamentos –Serviços (PNAUM – National Survey on Access, Use and Promotion of Rational Use of Medicines – Services) {{aimed to}} {{characterize}} the organization of pharmaceutical services in the Primary Health Care of the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS). PNAUM – Services is a cross-sectional and evaluative study, with planned sample of 600 cities, held between 2014 and 2015, composed of a remote phase, with telephone interviews with health managers. Of these 600 cities, 300 were selected for a survey on health services. We selected the 27 capitals, the 0. 5 % largest cities of each region, and the remaining cities were drawn. The estimate of the representative national sample size considered three levels: cities, medicine dispensing services, and patients. The interviews were carried out with a structured questionnaire specific for: municipal secretaries of health, professionals responsible for pharmaceutical services in the city, professionals responsible for the dispensing of medicines, physicians, and patients. The secondary data were obtained in official databases, in the latest <b>update</b> <b>date.</b> PNAUM – Services was the first nationwide research aimed at the assessment and acquisition of national and regional indicators on access to medicines, as well as use and rational use, {{from the perspective of}} various social subjects...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the {{reliability}} growth of Open Source Software (OSS) using Software Reliability Growth Models (SRGM). This study uses defects data of twenty five different releases of five OSS projects. For each release of the selected projects two types of datasets have been created; datasets developed with respect to defect creation date (created date DS) and datasets developed with respect to defect <b>updated</b> <b>date</b> (<b>updated</b> <b>date</b> DS). These defects datasets are modelled by eight SRGMs; Musa Okumoto, Inflection S-Shaped, Goel Okumoto, Delayed S-Shaped, Logistic, Gompertz, Yamada Exponential, and Generalized Goel Model. These models are chosen due to their widespread use in the literature. The SRGMs are fitted to both types of defects datasets of each project and the their fitting and prediction capabilities are analysed in order to study the OSS reliability growth with respect to defects creation and defects updating time because defect analysis can be used as a constructive reliability predictor. Results show that SRGMs fitting capabilities and prediction qualities directly increase when defects creation date is used for developing OSS defect datasets to characterize the reliability growth of OSS. Hence OSS reliability growth can be characterized with SRGM in a better way if the defect creation date is taken instead of defects <b>updating</b> (fixing) <b>date</b> while developing OSS defects datasets in their reliability modellin...|$|R

To assist provision of this information, the Centre for Advanced Engineering (CAE) in 1992 commissioned Leyland Consultants (now part of Sinclair Knight Merz) to undertake some initial modelling work to consider how expected increased demands for electricity could be met. This work was notable in that it not only highlighted New Zealand’s vulnerability to electricity shortages in dry years, but also the need for continued investment in additional generation capacity to meet increasing demand for electricity. The work also drew attention to the consequences of continued reliance on Maui gas for electricity generation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{consumption}} decisions of agents who face costs of acquiring, absorbing and processing information. These consumers rationally choose to only sporadically update their information and re-compute their optimal consumption plans. In between <b>updating</b> <b>dates,</b> they remain inattentive. This behavior implies that news disperses slowly throughout the population, so events have a gradual and delayed effect on aggregate consumption. The model predicts that aggregate consumption adjusts slowly to shocks, {{and is able}} to explain the excess sensitivity and excess smoothness puzzles. In addition, individual consumption is sensitive to ordinary and unexpected past news, but it is not sensitive to extraordinary or predictable events. The model further predicts that some people rationally choose to not plan, live hand-to-mouth, and save less, while other people sporadically update their plans. The longer are these plans, the more they save. Evidence using U. S. aggregate and microeconomic data generally supports these predictions. ...|$|R
