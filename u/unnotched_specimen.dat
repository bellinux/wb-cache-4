40|$|Aluminium {{die-casting}} {{is widely}} used in the automotive industry. Brackets, engine blocks, wheels and suspension arms etc. are typical applications. Due to the gases contained in the melt, more or less spherical pores arise in the cast components during the cooling procedure, usually with a higher concentration in the middle. The distribution of the pores depends both on the casting condition and on {{the form of the}} components and is stochastic. In the past, the simple way is often chosen for the fatigue life estimation of aluminium die-casting: The fatigue strengths of the material, e. g. in the form of S-N curves, are determined by an <b>unnotched</b> <b>specimen</b> which are then used in the fatigue calculation. However, the application of these data to real components with notches leads in many cases to fatigue life estimations which are by far too conservative. In the present paper a simple geometrical model of pores is presented. Using this model, the notch stress caused by a pore can be estimated. The behaviour of pores in a real component with notches will be treated. It will be shown that the mentioned conservative nature of the fatigue life prediction and the apparent notch insensitivity of aluminium die-casting {{can be explained by the}} facts that the stress distribution in a real component, contrary to an <b>unnotched</b> <b>specimen,</b> is inhomogeneous and that the porosity density on the surface is often low...|$|E

Compressive strength of an <b>unnotched</b> <b>specimen</b> has been obtained using Lockheed test fixture with modified specimen geometry. Power fits for peak contact force and maximum plate displacement have been given as a function of plate thickness. It is observed that the impact damage area has quasi-lemniscate shape.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{measuring}} large surface strains of three-dimensional bodies under tension is proposed, which utilizes the scattered light technique with polymer coating. A major {{advantage of this}} method is that interference fringes at the boundary between a real specimen and coatings can be observed directly. The difference in normal strains and shear strain {{on the surface of}} real specimen in axisymmetric tension problems can be calculated from three kinds of scattered-light fringe patterns obtained by three different incidences of polarized light. For the demonstration of effectiveness of this method, surface strains of solid and circumferentially notched cylindrical specimens made of aluminum alloy were measured under uniaxial tension. For the <b>unnotched</b> <b>specimen,</b> measured longitudinal strains were well consistent with ones calculated from the elongation of the gauge length.

40|$|Generally, {{areas of}} {{components}} with notches or geometrical transitions are critical {{because of the}} resulting stress/strain concentrations. In these areas due to the stress-gradients and constraint local deformations are displacement controlled even if the material's yield stress is exceeded, {{as long as the}} deformations are below the structural yield point. Therefore, load controlled tests in the elasto-plastic region with <b>unnotched</b> <b>specimens</b> from ductile materials under combined axial loading and torsion are not suitable for the interpretation of component's behavior because of uncontrolled local deformations. Thus, the influence of multiaxial stress strain states on the fatigue behavior of a component under elasto-plastic deformations can be determined reliably with <b>unnotched</b> <b>specimens</b> only by deformation controlled tests, if cyclic creep is not expected in critical areas...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{measuring}} surface strains of real specimens is proposed using the scattering photoviscoplastic analysis with polyester coating.

The difference in principal strains on the symmetric section of real specimen in two dimensional problems can be calculated using two kinds of scattered-light fringe patterns obtained by two different incidences of polarized light. For the demonstration of effectiveness of this method, surface strains of unnotched and semicircular notched plate specimens made of aluminum alloy were measured under uniaxial tension.

Four different notched and <b>unnotched</b> <b>specimen</b> geometries {{were used in}} this study. The stress concentration factors Kt were determined by finite element analysis (FEA) as depending on load case and specimen thickness. The measured nominal fatigue strength I at 107 cycles multiplied by the stress concentration factor Kt yields the locally endurable fatigue strength. Also by FEA, the volume V 90 around the highest first principle stress 1 was calculated which is enclosed by an envelope of 0. 9 I. If the locally endurable fatigue strength KtA is plotted versus the highly stressed volume V 90 all data fall into a narrow scatter band which can be described by a density modified three parameter Weibull distribution...|$|E
40|$|Cracking {{direction}} in multiaxial {{low cycle fatigue}} is an important research subject because crack initiation and propagation behavior is a physical background for developing an estimation method of multiaxial low cycle fatigue lives. However, {{there are a few}} open questions on cracking {{direction in}} multiaxial low cycle fatigue because cracking direction in multiaxial low cycle fatigue is complex and changes depending on stress multiaxiality, strain range, notch and material. This paper overviews cracking directions in tension-torsion low cycle fatigue of low alloy steels and nickel base superalloys. Two types of cracking directions in these materials, maximum shear direction and maximum principal direction, are discussed in relation with strain multiaxiality and an existence of notch and precrack. The two cracking directions in torsion low cycle fatigue of SUS 304 stainless steel are also discussed in relation with strain range. Detailed micro crack observations are finally presented to discuss the two cracking directions in torsion low cycle fatigue of a SUS 304 <b>unnotched</b> <b>specimen...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{displacement}} {{between the}} ridges situated outside the filleted test section of an axially loaded <b>unnotched</b> <b>specimen</b> is computed from the axial load {{and shape of}} the specimen and compared with extensometer deflection data obtained from experiments. The effect of prestrain on the extensometer deflection versus specimen strain curve has been studied experimentally and analytically. An analytical study shows that an increase in the slope of the stress-strain curve in the inelastic region increases the slope of the corresponding computed extensometer deflection versus specimen strain curve. A mathematical model has been developed which uses a modified length ¯ℓef in place of the actual length of the uniform diameter test section of the specimen. This model predicts the extensometer deflection within 5 % of the corresponding experimental value. This method has been successfully used by the authors to evolve an iterative procedure for predicting the cyclic specimen strain in axial fatigue tests on unnotched specimens...|$|E

The specimens were manufactured from epoxy-resin sheet (CT 1200) and the notches machined using a diamond impregnated saw. The notches were semi-circular, U-shaped and V-shaped and the crack length was varied up to 0. 6 of the specimen width. The specimens {{were subjected to}} pure Mode I loading and the fringe patterns {{used to calculate the}} Mode I stress intensity factor. A previously suggested notch correction term gives the ration of the stress intensity factor of a notched to an <b>unnotched</b> <b>specimen.</b> The correction term was determined for all three notches geometries and all crack lengths and the experimental data compared to a previously suggested empirical equation and Finite Element (FE) results.

40|$|Many {{researches}} {{are reported}} on the fatigue strength of unnotched specimens pre-strained. By their results， the fatigue limit of the pre-strained materials generally increase with increasing {{of the amount of}} pre-strain， but it is lower than that of the original when the pre-strain is small. While there are few investigations on the fatigue of notched specimens pre-strained. This paper is the results of experiment on the fatigue strength of the notched steel specimens having semi-circular groove of O. 54 mm radius，for which the tensile pre-strain and then the fatigue test by direct stress are conducted. And they are {{different from those of the}} previous investigations on the fatigue strength of the pre-strained unnotched materials. That is，the fatigue limit rises with the increasing of the amount of pre-stratin，even when the pre-strain is small. This pheomenon is made clear from the results of the measurement of micro-hardness on the cross section and the observation on the surface of the notch root，as following：the state of the notch root under small pre-strain corresponds to the large pre-strain of the <b>unnotched</b> <b>specimen...</b>|$|E
40|$|From {{the fatigue}} test of notched {{specimens}} of isotropic 70 : 30 - brass, under bending, torsion, and combined stress state of them, a simple criterion for the slip-band crack initiation has been obtained. In {{spite of the}} complexity of the triaxial stress state below the notch root, only two stress components, the maximum shearing stress τ_ and the normal stress σ_n acting on a particular slip plane, are responsible for initiating slip-band cracks. Using the averaged stress values over the half-grain-size depth below the notch root, linear sum of them, τ_ + a・σ_n, acts just as the torsional stress in <b>unnotched</b> <b>specimens.</b> At the fatigue limit, therefore, the value for any combined stress state coincides with the torsional one.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} variations of spatial distributions of cracks observed on the <b>unnotched</b> <b>specimen</b> surface during the fatigue process, plane bending fatigue tests {{were performed on}} carbon steel JIS, SS 41 in laboratory air and a sodium chloride aqueous solution. Two methods, developed by Morishita and Ono {{in the field of}} mathematical ecology, were used in analyzing the spatial distributions of Cracks. The following results were obtained. The spatial distributions of cracks are influenced by both stress amplitude and stress cycling. In the high stress amplitude region, the distributions are nearly random, while in the low stress amplitude region, the distributions have clumps indicating nonrandom distribution. This result was common to both fatigue in air and corrosion fatigue. With increasing stress cycling, the spatial distributions of cracks approach random distributions in the high stress amplitude region, while in the low stress amplitude region, the distributions show a strong tendency to have two kinds of clumps whose sizes are 1 / 4 mm^ 2 and 8 mm^ 2...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{stresses}} {{induced by the}} lamination of off-axis plies to O-deg lamina {{on the development of}} damage during the fatigue loading of the O-deg plies are discussed. The transverse normal stresses in the plane of the laminae and the laminate created by the laminating constraints when an axial force is applied to the laminate are calculated in terms of a differential Poisson ratio between the ply in question in the unconstrained and constrained states, and significant differences in the constraint environments of an <b>unnotched</b> <b>specimen</b> joined to plies of 45 and 90 deg inclination are noted which correspond to an increase in longitudinal splitting in the 90 deg case and a marked decrease in longitudinal splitting in the 45 deg case. If a notch is present, shear and crack-opening damage is found to be very effectively suppressed in 45 -deg laminates, and less so in the 90 -deg case. It is pointed out that whereas the 45 -deg laminate represents the least damage situation, it does not have the greatest notched strength. It is concluded that an understanding and prediction of damage development in laminates requires knowledge of the stress fields caused by the lamination constraints...|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} a new technique for {{the determination of the}} material property characterizing the resistance to ductile fracture from a single tensile test on an <b>unnotched</b> <b>specimen.</b> The property known as the essential work of fracture (EWF) is usually associated with the specific energy, per unit cross sectional area, consumed during ductile fracture in a double edge notched tensile (DENT) specimen. This energy is referred to as 'essential' in order to distinguish it from the non-essential energy consumed on distributed plastic deformation accompanying fracture, but not required for material separation. In the present study we consider tensile tests carried out on unnotched dog-bone (DB) tensile specimens carrying large numbers of markers and incorporating continuous measurement of elongation between any two markers using a laser scanning extensometer. In a single test it is therefore possible to obtain multiple load-elongation curves for a large number of tensile specimens. This data is analyzed by separating contributions to specimen elongation made by distributed (pre-softening) and localized (post-softening) plastic deformation. We demonstrate on a series of tests the evaluation of essential and non-essential work of necking and tearing for an aluminum alloy subjected to different heat treatments, and compare the results with those obtained from conventional DENT tests...|$|E

The results of stress-strain relationships showed that the slight nonlinearity of the curves were observed for these two specimens, which was associated with the plastic deformation of localized resin. The damage patterns of notched and <b>unnotched</b> <b>specimens</b> at different temperatures proved that damage and plastic deformation were two simultaneous mechanisms and it was prominent in the notched.

40|$|Not only {{intergranular}} (IG) crack {{but also}} quasi-cleavage (QC) crack {{play a vital}} role in the hydrogen assisted fracture process of Q/T ASTM A 490 steels. Fractographic analysis of the fracture surface of the specimen revealed that at the beginning of a fracture process a QC crack was developed at the site of a micro-defect, such as a non-metallic inclusion inherent in the engineering materials, and grew to critical size, triggering the fatal unstable growth of an IG crack, involving a change of the propagation mode from QC to IG cracking. A particular fracture toughness value associated with hydrogen degradation can be obtained from the event of unstable growth of an IG crack during the fracture test. This fracture toughness value, KIH, can be explained as the critical condition for the onset of unstable growth of an IG crack or crack growth resistance of the hydrogen-damaged grain boundary. The generality of the statement was confirmed by further experiments employing a specially prepared <b>unnotched</b> <b>specimen,</b> having a fatigue precrack that triggered the onset of IG crack growth in the same manner as the QC crack. Furthermore, the discussion is extended to the essential nature of the hydrogen assisted fracture process by comparing the cracking behaviour in notched and unnotched specimens...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis work {{seeks to}} {{investigate}} the notch sensitivity and fracture behaviour of orthogonal Kevlar-plain woven fabric (PWF) - reinforced thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU) film applied to high altitude balloon. Four types of specimens are implemented to measure notched strength and fracture toughness by conducting static tension and tear tests on an MTS system respectively. The damage and failure mechanisms are discussed and the results for notched strength and tear resistance are evaluated and compared with each other. From the experiments, {{it is found that}} the notch sensitivity of the film increases with the increase {{in the size of the}} hole, but the notch sensitivity and the stress concentration of the notch are insignificant and there is a decrease of only about 4 %- 10 % in tensile strength for the notched specimens with different hole sizes in diameter compared with the <b>unnotched</b> <b>specimen.</b> In contrast, the tear resistance containing a central slit with only 1 mm length is about half of tensile strength of the unnotched film, which implies that the tear resistance exists an significant notch sensitivity.

40|$|The {{purpose was}} to {{characterize}} damage initiation and growth in notched titanium matrix composites at room temperature. Double edge notched or center open hole SCS- 6 /Ti- 15 - 3 specimens containing 0 deg plies or containing both 0 and 90 deg plies were fatigued. The specimens were tested in the as-fabricated (ASF) and in heat-treated conditions. A local strain criterion using <b>unnotched</b> <b>specimen</b> fatigue data was successful in predicting fatigue damage initiation. The initiation stress level was accurately predicted for both a double edge notched unidirectional specimen and a cross-plied center hole specimen. The fatigue produced long multiple cracks growing from the notches. These fatigue cracks were only in the matrix material and did not break the fibers in their path. The combination of matrix cracking and fiber/matrix debonding appears to greatly reduce the stress concentration around the notches. The laminates that were heat treated showed a different crack growth pattern. In the ASF specimens, matrix cracks had a more tortuous path and showed considerable more crack branching.

40|$|It {{has been}} widely {{accepted}} that the tensile properties of a concrete can be enhanced substantially by incorporating high strength and small diameter fibers, leading to a fiber reinforced concrete (FRC). In the present study, a new direct tensile test-ing configuration for an <b>unnotched</b> <b>specimen</b> was firstly proposed and implemented to evaluate the tensile behavior of concrete and FRC. In the configuration, a ball-joint loading fixture was developed such that an ideal hinge boundary condition is guaranteed. A complete load-displacement curve can always be obtained by using this technique. Extensive uniaxial tensile tests were then conducted for FRCs with varying fiber types, fiber volume fractions, and matrix composition. Tensile strain hardening responses were {{for the first time}} observed for FRCs containing a higher volume fraction of short steel fibers when the matrix was carefully designed. Acoustic emission (AE) technique was then employed to monitor the fracture behavior of concrete and FRC during a direct tensile testing. An adaptive trigger signal identifier was developed and implemented in the AE measurement. An adaptive FIR lowpass filter was proposed to process the AE signals which can remove the measurement noises efficiently and preserve the true signal. A new P-wave arrival time determination method was then developed. AE analyses were then performed to study the damage initiation and propagation by interpreting the AE activities and locations of AE event sources. Microcracking behavior inside a material was found to be in good agreement with the macroscopic response. Based on the experimental observations, an analytical model was also developed to predict the tensile stress-strain behavior of FRC showing a hardening response, according to the principles of the Continuum Damage Mechanics. Fiber-matrix in-terfacial behavior was incorporated in the model. Results predicted by the model show good agreement with those obtained experimentally...|$|E
40|$|The {{state of}} stress {{in the core of}} a notched bar is {{analysed}} at the moment when pronounced plastic yielding begins. The theory is two-dimensional and an ideal plastic-rigid material is assumed. Following a general analysis of the problem, the magnitude of the constraint factor is calculated for a deep notch with a semi-circular root. The correct approach to problems of plane plastic strain is discussed, and is further illustrated by a re-examination of the classical work of Frandtl on indentation (which is closely related in principle with the notched bar problem). 1. General considerations THE paper is concerned with the {{state of stress}} in the core of a notched bar under an applied load sufficient to cause plastic flow. It is known that the fairly well-defined bend in the load-extension relation for a notched bar corresponds to a mean stress in the core that is greater than the yield stress in a tensile test of an <b>unnotched</b> <b>specimen.</b> The " investiga-tion will be directed particularly to a calculation of the magnitude of this effect in relation to the shape of the notch. The problem will be treated as one of plane strain, so that the specimen is a wide rectangular block, symmetrically notched through the thickness on two sides. The notch is shown in Fig. 1, the plane of the paper representing a plane of flow. Let it be supposed that the applied load at the ends of the specimen is statically equivalent to a tension along the central longitudinal axis. It is also supposed that a distribution of stress, suitable to ensure plane strain, is applied to the two lateral surfaces of the block which are parallel to the planes of flow. The specimen is assumed so long that the state of stress in the neighbourhood of the notch is, to any desired approximation, independent of the precise distribution of the end load. It is further assumed that the notch is of sufficient depth to ensure that the plastic region is localized in and around the core (this will be discussed more carefully later). If the curvature of the notch is greatest at the root, the yield limit is first attained at that point. As the applied end-load is further increased, the plastic region can be expected to spread in thn manner shown i...|$|E
