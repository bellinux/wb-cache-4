5|$|In August 2010, {{a former}} Pakistani {{intelligence}} officer approached the U.S. embassy station chief in Islamabad {{and offered to}} reveal bin Laden's location, {{in return for the}} $25 million reward, according to a retired senior <b>U.S.</b> <b>intelligence</b> official. This story was corroborated by two <b>U.S.</b> <b>intelligence</b> officials speaking to NBC News, and had been previously reported by intelligence analyst Raelynn Hillhouse. The Pakistani official informed <b>U.S.</b> <b>intelligence</b> that bin Laden had been located by Pakistani ISI in 2006, and held under house arrest near Pakistani intelligence and military centers ever since. The official passed polygraph tests, after which the U.S. began local and satellite surveillance of bin Laden's Abbottabad residence.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the retired}} senior <b>U.S.</b> <b>intelligence</b> {{official}} speaking to Hersh, bin Laden was ill at this point, financially supported by some within Saudi Arabia, and {{kept by the}} ISI to better manage their complex relationship with Pakistani and Afghan Islamist groups. According to the official, retired CIA officials {{emphasized the importance of}} bin Laden's courier to the press, because they were nervous over torture scrutiny and possible prosecution.|$|E
5|$|Accounts of how bin Laden {{was located}} by <b>U.S.</b> <b>intelligence</b> differ. The White House and CIA {{director}} John Brennan {{stated that the}} process began with a fragment of information unearthed in 2002, resulting in years of investigation. This account states that by September 2010, these leads followed a courier to the Abbottabad compound, where the U.S. began intensive multiplatform surveillance. According to journalist Seymour Hersh and NBC News, however, the U.S. was tipped off about bin Laden's location by a Pakistani intelligence officer who offered details of where the Pakistani Intelligence Service held him in detention {{in exchange for a}} bounty.|$|E
5|$|Born in Panama City to a poor mestizo family, Noriega {{studied at}} the Chorrillos Military School in Lima and at the School of the Americas. He became {{an officer in the}} Panamanian army, and rose through the ranks in {{alliance}} with Omar Torrijos. In 1968, Torrijos overthrew President Arnulfo Arias in a coup, establishing himself as leader; under Torrijos' government, Noriega became chief of military intelligence. After Torrijos' death in 1981, Noriega consolidated his power to become Panama's de facto ruler in 1983. From the 1950s until shortly before the U.S. invasion, Noriega worked with <b>U.S.</b> <b>intelligence</b> agencies. Noriega was one of the Central Intelligence Agency's most valued intelligence sources, as well as one of the primary conduits for illicit weapons, military equipment and cash destined for U.S.-backed counter-insurgency forces throughout Latin America. The U.S. also regarded Noriega as an ally in its War on Drugs, despite Noriega himself having amassed a personal fortune through drug trafficking operations. Though his <b>U.S.</b> <b>intelligence</b> handlers were aware of this, it was allowed because of his usefulness to the U.S.|$|E

5|$|In 1961 <b>U.S.</b> <b>intelligence</b> analysts {{estimated}} that 5,843 enemy infiltrators (actually 4,000) had moved {{south on the}} trail; in 1962, 12,675 (actually 5,300); in 1963, 7,693 (actually 4,700); and in 1964, 12,424. The supply capacity of the trail reached 20 to 30 tonnes per day in 1964 and it was estimated by the U.S. that 12,000 (actually 9,000) North Vietnamese regulars had reached South Vietnam that year. By 1965 the U.S. command in Saigon {{estimated that}} communist supply requirements for their southern forces amounted to 234 tons of all supplies per day and that 195 tons were moving through Laos.|$|E

5|$|In April 1987 Reagan {{appointed}} Matlock as Ambassador to the Soviet Union.

Within a few months of the Lonetree scandal, all <b>U.S.</b> <b>intelligence</b> assets in the Soviet Union had been exposed. The Americans suspected that the security breach had meant that the Embassy code room was no longer secure and worked frantically to determine how. It was not until 1994 that Aldrich Ames, a mole within the CIA, was caught. Another mole, Robert Hanssen, this time within the FBI, was caught only in 2001.|$|E

5|$|After several months, Noriega was {{transferred}} to the province of Chiriquí, where Torrijos and Díaz Herrera were posted. That year's presidential election was contested by Arnulfo Arias, a native of that province. The sitting President, Rodolfo Chiari, ordered Torrijos to harass Arias's party members, to weaken his election bid. Torrijos passed this task on to Noriega, whose men arrested a number of people. Several prisoners said that they had been tortured; others stated they had been raped in prison. The brutality of Noriega's activities led to him being suspended for ten days, an item of information that was picked up by the <b>U.S.</b> <b>intelligence</b> services.|$|E
5|$|In 2011 American {{intelligence}} analyst Raelynn Hillhouse {{wrote that}} according to <b>U.S.</b> <b>intelligence</b> sources, the U.S. had been tipped-off to bin Laden's location by an unnamed Pakistani intelligence insider collecting the $25 million reward. According to the sources, Pakistan purposely stood-down its armed forces to allow the U.S. raid, and the original plan was to kill – not capture – bin Laden. Hillhouse's sources stated that the Pakistanis had been keeping bin Laden under house arrest near their military headquarters in Abbottabad with money provided by the Saudis. According to The Telegraph, Hillhouse's account might explain why U.S. forces encountered no resistance {{on their way to}} and in Abbottabad, and why some residents in Abbottabad were warned to stay in their houses the day before the raid.|$|E
