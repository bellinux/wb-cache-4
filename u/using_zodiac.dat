Patients with hearing problems or middle ear dysfunctions were also excluded after doing a full audiological history, otological examination, and basic audiological evaluation including pure tone audiometry for the frequency range 250 – 8000  Hz and speech audiometry (using GSI- 61 audiometer) and immittancemetry (<b>using</b> <b>Zodiac</b> Madsen).|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{digital video}} {{playback}} systems provide only limited user interactivity, {{mostly in the}} form of VCRlike controls such as fast forward/backward, slow motion, pause/stop, etc. In this model, the temporal ordering and the spatial viewpoints of the video streams being viewed are completely determined at authoring time. In contrast, this research project describes an Active Video system, which supports hyper-linking among related video sequences and interpolation of video sequences with neighboring viewpoints, to offer end users the additional flexibility of choosing the sequencing and the viewing angle at playback time, respectively. An active video system consists of two components: an active video editor, which authors may use to compose active video content, and an active video server, which can play back active video streams according to viewers' navigational preferences. We have designed and implemented an active video editing tool, called Zodiac, that supports "hyper-video" using object tracking technology, and view interpolation using image-based rendering (IBR) technology. Zodiac also uses object tracking technology to simplify the application of IBR in video sequences. The tool incorporates novel lossy and lossless compression algorithms to reduce additional storage costs and disk bandwidth overhead associated with active video content. We propose to build an active video server (AVS) to store and deliver the active video content created <b>using</b> <b>Zodiac.</b> The AVS supports integrated real time CPU, network, and disk scheduling to provide end-to-end performance guarantee to playback of active video streams. It also provides a programming model using which one may specify the feedback-sensitive media processing required for the playback of a bro [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Extract] There {{are several}} aboriginal-owned whale-watching ventures in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. These include viewing orca (killer whale) with Village Island Tours (Telegraph Cove, BC), {{operated}} since 1989 by Tom Sewid, a Kwakwak'awakw First Nations man. His boat, painted with a First Nations Orca design, is named Gla-Lis (finning whale). The Kwakwak'awakw {{people believe that}} chiefs are reborn as killer whales. On {{the west coast of}} Vancouver Island, other First Nation groups operate boat tours viewing orca and grey whales. In Quebec, eastern Canada, the Essipit-Montagnais First Nation have run whale-watching boat tours on the St Lawrence River estuary since 1994; they <b>use</b> <b>zodiac</b> boats to view common and blue finback whales. The company employs six full-time staff and purchased a new whale watch vessel in 1999 with funds from Aboriginal Business Canada. Whale watching provides 60 % of their income.

5000|$|Approximately every 26,000 {{years the}} zodiacal constellations, the {{associated}} sidereal zodiac, and the tropical <b>zodiac</b> <b>used</b> by western astrologers basically align. Technically {{this is when}} the tropical and sidereal [...] "first point in Aries" [...] (Aries 0°) coincided. This alignment is often called the [...] point and, if the fiducial point could be found, fairly exact timeframes of all the astrological ages could be accurately determined (if the method {{used to determine the}} astrological ages is based on the equal-sized 30 degrees per age and do not correspond to the exact constellation configuration in the sky). However this fiducial point is difficult to determine because while there is no ambiguity about the tropical <b>zodiac</b> <b>used</b> by western astrologers, the same cannot be said of the sidereal <b>zodiac</b> <b>used</b> by Vedic astrologers. Vedic astrologers do not have unanimity on the exact location in space of their sidereal zodiac. This is because the sidereal zodiac is superimposed upon the irregular zodiacal constellation, and there are no unambiguous boundaries of the zodiacal constellations. Modern day astronomers have defined boundaries, but this is a recent development by astronomers who are divorced from astrology, and cannot be assumed to be correct from the astrological perspective. While most astronomers and some astrologers agree that the fiducial point occurred in or around the 3rd to 5th centuries AD, there is no consensus on any exact date or tight timeframe within these three centuries. A number of dates are proposed by various astronomers and even wider timeframes by astrologers.
