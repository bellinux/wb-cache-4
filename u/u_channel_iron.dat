50|$|The key {{economic}} criteria for <b>channel</b> <b>iron</b> deposits are, firstly tonnage and location relative to infrastructure {{similar to other}} bulk commodities. Thereafter, {{the nature of the}} cement is important, particularly in the cases of carbonate cements containing magnesite, as magnesium is a problem. Rare <b>channel</b> <b>iron</b> deposits are rendered uneconomic because of a silica cement proving too durable for easy mining and crushing. The water content of <b>channel</b> <b>iron</b> deposits (quoted as Loss on Ignition) is from 7% to 12%, which is the highest of all iron ore types, generally due to the presence of goethite-limonite. Phosphorus, aluminium and sulfur levels are another concern, typically being above normal levels in-situ although if the phosphorus and aluminium are hosted in a weak cement, they can often be washed out during beneficiation. Most <b>channel</b> <b>irons</b> are upgraded via washing of the pisolite gravels to remove the cements and matrix.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Channel</b> <b>iron</b> systems {{typically}} form {{within a}} depression on the Cenozoic ‘Hamersley Surface’, and form several pods downstream on the palaeodrainage. The channels show typical fluvial sedimentary morphology, with channel scours truncating or incising the <b>channel</b> <b>iron</b> deposits, and rare examples of graded bedding, and so on. Individual ore deposits are subsets {{of a larger}} sub-economic mineralized system, which varies laterally and along the palaeodrainage.

5000|$|<b>Channel</b> <b>iron</b> {{deposits}} are {{an important}} source of iron ore, with the deposits at Yandi and Robe River accounting for approximately 47% of iron ore mined from the Hamerley <b>Iron</b> province. Although <b>channel</b> <b>iron</b> deposits are typically low-grade at 53% to 57% Fe in-situ, they are composed of goethite-limonite which are hydrated iron oxide species. Ore typically contains around 8% to 12% water, and <5% SiO2, and <3% Al2O3. The hydrous iron oxides can be calcined, and the CID ore on a volatile-free basis is around 63% Fe or more.|$|R

5000|$|Popov {{nearly doubled}} the {{thickness}} of the armour on Vitse-admiral Popov compared to that on Novgorod. The design was complicated by the inability of the Izhorskiye Zavody ironworks to roll armour plates more than 9 in thick, so Popov decided to build a [...] "sandwich" [...] of armour. The outer belt armour was separated by 9 inches of teak reinforced by interlocking <b>channel</b> <b>irons</b> from the inner armour layer, which was itself backed by another 9 inches of teak and <b>channel</b> <b>irons.</b> The upper strake of the outer armour was also 9 inches thick and the lower was 7 in thick. The inner armour was also 7 inches thick, which gave a total thickness of 16 in at the waterline and 14 in below it. The armour of the ship's barbette was identical to that of the upper strake of the belt armour. The rounded deck was protected by a total of 2.75 in of armour, made up of three layers of plates ranging in thickness from 0.75 to 1 in.|$|R
5000|$|On the Tay Bridge the {{diagonal}} bracing was {{by means of}} flat bars running from one lug at the column section top (an {{integral part of the}} column casting) to two sling plates bolted to {{the diagonal}}ly opposite lug.

Two cotters (metal wedges) were then positioned to fill the rest of the slot overlap, and driven in hard to put the tie under tension. Horizontal bracing was provided by (wrought <b>iron)</b> <b>channel</b> <b>iron.</b> The various bolt heads were too close to each other, and to the column for easy tightening up with spanners; this coupled with lack of precision in the preparation of the <b>channel</b> <b>iron</b> braces led to various on site fitting expedients (one of them described by a witness to the enquiry as [...] "about as slovenly a piece of work as ever I saw in my life").) ...|$|R

30|$|A novel {{high-performance}} rectangular gate <b>U</b> <b>channel</b> FET (RGUC FET) for extreme integrated {{distance between}} source and drain contacts is proposed in this paper. The RGUC FET represents nearly ideal subthreshold characteristics till {{the distance between}} source/drain (S/D) contacts reduced to 2 [*]nm. Different from the other recessed or U-shaped channel-based FETs, the gate contacts {{do not need to}} be formed in the recessed region but only in a layer of spacer for the insulation between the two vertical parts on both sides of the <b>U</b> <b>channel.</b> Its structural advantages make it possible to be applied to manufacture integrated circuits with higher integration for extreme integrated distance between source and drain contacts. The electrical properties of the RGUC FET were scrupulously investigated by studying the influence of design parameters including the horizontal distance between S/D contacts, the extension height of S/D region, and the thickness and material of the gate oxide layer. The electrical properties of the RGUC FET are verified by quantum simulation. Compared to the other non-planner channel multi-gate FETs, the novel RGUC FET is suitable for higher integration.|$|R

40|$|With the {{development}} of pass-through cryogenic magnetometers and the <b>u</b> <b>channel</b> sampling method, large volumes of paleomagnetic data can be accumulated {{within a short time}} period. It is often critical to visualize and process these data in “real time” as measurements proceed, so that the measurement plan can be dictated accordingly. We introduce new MATLAB™ software (UPmag) that is designed for easy and rapid analysis of natural remanent magnetization (NRM) and laboratory-induced remanent magnetization data for <b>u</b> <b>channel</b> samples or core sections. UPmag comprises three MATLAB™ graphic user interfaces: UVIEW, UDIR, and UINT. UVIEW allows users to open and check through measurement data from the magnetometer as well as to correct detected flux jumps in the data, and to export files for further treatment. UDIR reads the *. dir file generated by UVIEW, automatically calculates component directions using selectable demagnetization range(s) with anchored or free origin, and displays vector component plots and stepwise intensity plots for any position along the <b>u</b> <b>channel</b> sample. UDIR can also display data on equal area stereographic projections and draw virtual geomagnetic poles on various map projections. UINT provides a convenient platform to evaluate relative paleointensity (RPI) estimates using the *. int files that can be exported from UVIEW. Two methods are used for RPI estimation: the calculated slopes of the best fit line between the NRM and the respective normalizer (using paired demagnetization data for both parameters) and the averages of the NRM/normalizer ratios. Linear correlation coefficients (of slopes) and standard deviations (of ratios) can be calculated simultaneously to monitor the quality of the RPI estimates. All resulting data and plots from UPmag can be exported into various file formats. UPmag software, data format files, and test data can be downloaded from [URL]...|$|R
