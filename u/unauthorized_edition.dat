2500|$|In his retirement, Warnery found {{satisfaction}} in military writing, producing commentaries on Roman empire achievements, {{the development of}} cavalry, comparisons of Turkish and Russian tactics, and an analysis of Frederick's campaigns in the Seven Years' War. Warnery's achievements as a writer were possibly more significant than his military accomplishments. His numerous works were republished long after their composition. According to his origins in French-speaking Vaud, {{he wrote in the}} French language. One <b>unauthorized</b> <b>edition</b> first appeared in 1766 in German, so he wrote an extended edition of Remarques sur le militaire et le marine des Turcs et Russes, published in Breslau (1771).

Some 19th century critics of military tactics considered his analysis of Frederick's cavalry to be among the best, but acknowledge that Warnery's opinions and analysis of cavalry units, their structure, training and tactics reflect Seydlitz's. [...] Seydlit'z own regiment served as a basis for Warnery's analysis of cavalry.|$|E
2500|$|Tolkien had {{authorized}} {{a paperback}} edition of The Hobbit in 1961, though that edition was never made available outside the U.K. Eventually, he supported paperback editions of The Lord of the Rings {{and several of}} his other texts, {{but it is difficult to}} say whether he was persuaded to do so by the manifest economic wisdom evident in sales of the Ace editions. In any case, Ace was forced to cease publishing the <b>unauthorized</b> <b>edition</b> and to pay Tolkien for their sales following a grass-roots campaign by Tolkien's U.S. fans. A 1993 court determined that the copyright loophole suggested by Ace Books was invalid and its paperback edition was found to have been a violation of copyright under US law. (At this time, the U.S. had yet to join the International Copyright Convention, and most laws on the books existed to protect domestic creations from foreign infringement. Houghton Mifflin was technically in violation of the law when they exceeded their import limits and failed to renew their interim copyright.)

Red Book preserves the cover and typeface of the 1st edition of C&S. C&S was originally created in 1977 by two Canadian game designers, Edward E. Simbalist and Wilf K.

5000|$|Copyright law in Argentina {{was first}} {{introduced}} by the 1853 Constitution of Argentina. The article 17º states that [...] "Every author or inventor is the exclusive owner of his work, invention or discovery, for the term granted by law". Juan Bautista Alberdi intended for the copyright term to be indefinite, but during {{the writing of the}} Constitution it was decided to give a time limit, as done in Chile and the United States. The enactment of the Constitution was followed by the Law 111, but it was a patent law and had no mention to artistic works. However, despite the lack of a specific copyright law, jurisprudence would usually still grant copyright protection based in the Constitutional article alone. For example, there was a trial about an <b>unauthorized</b> <b>edition</b> of José Hernández's Martín Fierro, where the civil justice of Buenos Aires considered the 17º article fully operative.|$|E

5000|$|Scholars {{differ on}} the key {{question}} of whether the actual emblems in question are the visual images, the accompanying texts, or the combination of the two. This is understandable, given that the first emblem book, the Emblemata of Andrea Alciato, was first issued in an <b>unauthorized</b> <b>edition</b> in which the woodcuts were chosen by the printer without any input from the author, who had circulated the texts in unillustrated manuscript form. Some early emblem books were unillustrated, particularly those issued by the French printer Denis de Harsy. With time, however, the reading public came to expect emblem books to contain picture-text combinations. Each combination consisted of a woodcut or engraving accompanied by one or more short texts, intended to inspire their readers to reflect on a general moral lesson derived from the reading of both picture and text together. The picture was subject to numerous interpretations: only by reading the text could a reader be certain which meaning was intended by the author. Thus the books are closely related to the personal symbolic picture-text combinations called personal devices, known in Italy as [...] and in France as [...]|$|E
