40|$|We {{analyzed}} 95 {{patients with}} renal pelvic and <b>ureteral</b> <b>cancers</b> with total nephroureterectomy at our Department fromJanuary, 1997 to April, 2007. The patients were composed of 60 males and 35 females, between 41 - and 90 -years-old {{with a median}} age of 69 -years-old. Histologically, there were 94 transitional cell carcinomas (TCC) and 1 TCC with squamous cell carcinoma. Fifty five cases (57. 9 %) were less than pT 2, and 41 cases (42. 1 %) were more than pT 3. Findings of lymphatic and venous invasion were present in 35 cases and 24 cases respectively. The overall survival rate at 5 years was 76. 6 %. In this series, pathological stage, infiltration pattern, lymphatic and/or venous invasion and the regional lymph nodes indicated a significantly poor prognosis. On the other hand, multivariate analysis using Cox proportional hazards regression revealed the presence of pathological stage as the most significant predictor of survival. Furthermore, we investigated histopathological prognostic factors of the patients separating asymptomatic macrohematuria group (AM group) and non-asymptomatic macrohematuria group (non-AM group). According to this analysis, non-AM group had worse pathological stage, grade and lymphatic invasion than AM group. 1997 年 1 月- 2007 年 4 月に手術を施行し腎盂尿管癌(移行上皮癌) と診断された 95 例(男 60 名、女 35 名、年齢 41 - 90 歳) を対象に臨床病理学的因子、予後、および初診時の肉眼的血尿の有無について検討した。術前尿細胞診で明らかとなった 92 例のうち 65. 2 %がclass IV、Vの陽性で、尿細胞診の陽性率は異型度のgradeの高さに相関する傾向を示し、深達度に有意差は認めなかった。組織学的深達度と異型度、浸潤増殖様式(INF) 、壁内リンパ管侵襲(pL) 、壁内静脈侵襲(pV) の関係は有意な予後因子であった。腫瘍因子別生存率について予後規定因子として深達度、異型度、浸潤増殖様式、壁内リンパ管侵襲、リンパ節転移(N) について検討した結果、pT 2 以下とpT 3 以上、INF α、βとINF γ、pL 0 とpL 1 、pV 0 とpV 1 、リンパ節転移の陽性および陰性間で有意差を認めた。予後因子の多変量解析による各因子の予後への影響の強さは、リスク比では深達度が有意に独立した予後因子であった。肉眼的血尿の有無による予後比較では深達度で非血尿群がpT 2 以上の浸潤癌症例、異型度ではG 3 症例および壁内リンパ管侵襲症例が有意に多く、病理組織学的に有意にhigh gradeかつhigh stageで高悪性度の可能性を示していた。 5 年生存率は血尿群に対し非血尿群は有意に低く、無症候性腎盂尿管癌の早期発見が予後改善の可能性に寄与すると考えた...|$|R
40|$|An {{immunohistochemical}} {{study of}} the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and c-erbB- 2 protein was performed in fresh-frozen sections from 30 patients with transitional cell cancers (TCCs) of the upper urinary tract (15 renal pelvic <b>cancers,</b> 15 <b>ureteral</b> <b>cancers)</b> who underwent total nephroureterectomy. We followed them and examined whether TCC appeared in the urinary bladder. The follow-up period ranged from 116 to 2348 days (mean 666 days). The mean period until a secondary urinary bladder cancer appeared was 306 days (116 - 829 days). Thirteen of those 30 TCCs (43. 3 %) showed increased expression of EGFR, and 11 TCCs (36. 7 %) showed increased expression of c-erbB- 2. In 12 of 30 patients (40. 0 %), a secondary urinary bladder cancer appeared after surgery. In {{only one of the}} ten patients (10. 0 %) whose tumours did not exhibit increased expression of either of these receptors the tumour recurred in bladder. On the other hand, in 11 of 20 (55. 0 %) patients whose tumours had increased EGFR and/or c-erbB- 2 expression, secondary urinary bladder cancers recurred after surgery (P < 0. 05). Thus, the recurrence rate of TCCs with increased EGFR and/or c-erbB- 2 expression was significantly higher than that of tumours showing no increased expression of these receptors (P < 0. 01). These results suggest that the immunohistochemical detection of the expression of EGFR and c-erbB- 2 in urothelial cancers of the upper urinary tract might be a useful method for determining the likelihood of secondary bladder cancer recurrences...|$|R

40|$|The early {{diagnosis}} of intra-ureteral tumor is yet difficult. To approach this clinical problem, a new method of intra-ureteral biopsy was attempted. Under sacral block, a bortUia stone basket is passed {{up through the}} site of the lesion and manipulated. On withdrawing the basket from the ureter, it would pick up a small fragment of tumor tissue or sometimes blood clot. It was noted that satisfactory intra-ureteral biopsies were obtained in each of three cases of <b>ureteral</b> or pelvi-ureteral <b>cancer,</b> without particular difficulty and without ill-effect upon the patient. In all cases, the accuracy of the biopsy including Broders' cellular classification was confirmed by subsequent operation. Even when a piece of tumor fails to be picked up, a blood clot was also diagnostic {{because of the presence of}} clusters of atypical cells in it. The purpose of such biopsy is not only to make a conclusive diagnosis of ureteral tumor even at an early stage and to differentiate it from other causes of filling defects but to choose an adequate opetation on microscopic cellular grading. Application of the method should improve the percentage of correct preoperative diagnosis of ureteral tumors which has been unsatisfactory in the past...|$|R

The Pim serine/threonine kinases have been shown to be overexpressed in cancer. Elevated levels of Pim 1 kinase were demonstrated in human leukemia and lymphomas, as well as in solid tumors such as pancreatic, prostate and bladder cancers, and have been proposed as a prognostic marker. Although the Pim kinases have been identified as oncogenes in transgenic mouse models, they have only weak transforming abilities on their own. However, they have been shown to greatly enhance the ability of other genes or chemical carcinogens to induce tumors. To explore the role of Pim 1 in bladder and <b>ureteral</b> urothelial <b>cancer,</b> we generated a conditional Pim 1 transgenic mouse model and found that prostate specific antigen-(PSA) -driven Cre expression lead to transgene expression in the bladder upon (testosterone/estrogen) hormone treatment. We then explored the effect of Pim 1 overexpression on hormone treatment, either alone or in combination with Pten haploinsufficiency. We found that Pim 1 overexpression increased the severity of bladder and ureteral urothelial hyperplasias in both backgrounds, leading to pyelonephritis in transgenic animals. Our data suggest that Pim 1 might contribute to progression, rather than initiation, and that the hyperplasias also contribute to the development of pyelonephritis.

On {{the basis of this}} experiment, the positive plasma CEA level was designated as above 6 ng/ml [...] , therefore among the 58 control patients, positive plasma CEA was found in 8. 6 %. Out of 163 patients, 59 patients (92 samples) had, at the time of assay, bladder cancer and the plasma CEA values were 6. 8 ± 4. 9 ng/ml. After treatment, 55 patients (74 samples) became free of bladder cancer and the plasma CEA values were 3. 1 ± 1. 9 ng/ml. The comparison was significant (p< 0. 001). Of 59 patients with bladder cancer, the plasma CEA was high in 42 (45. 6 %) of 92 samples. In 55 patients who had treatment the plasma CEA was high in only 9 (12. 1 %,) of 74 samples after operation. Again, the difference was significant (p< 0. 01). Sixteen patients with renal pelvic and <b>ureteral</b> <b>cancer,</b> the plasma CEA values were 6. 8 ± 5. 4 ng/ml. After treatment there were 8 patients free of renal pelvic and <b>ureteral</b> <b>cancer</b> and their plasma CEA values were 3. 5 ± 2. 8 ng/ml. In 58 control patients, the values were 3. 1 ± 1. 9 ng/ml. The difference was significant (p< 0. 001). Therefore, the plasma CEA was high in 8 (50 %) of 16 patients with renal and <b>ureteral</b> <b>cancer,</b> but after treatment only one (12. 5 %,) was high out of 8 patients. There was a significant difference between renal pelvic and <b>ureteral</b> <b>cancer</b> and the control patients (p< 0. 001), but 8 patients without the cancer after treatment showed no difference. In 22 patients with renal cancer, the plasma CEA values were 5. 7 ± 4. 6 ng/ml. After treatment, 9 patients without renal cancer showed the plasma CEA values 2. 8 ± 1. 3 ng/ml. !. The difference was not significant. The incidence of CEA-positive cases in renal cancer was 36. 3 %" but, after treatment 9 patients free of renal cancer were all CEA-negative. In 9 patients with prostatic cancer, the plasma CEA was 6. 0 ± 4. 9 ng/ml. This value was significantly high (p< 0. 01). Whereas in 11 patients with well controlled prostatic cancer the plasma CEA were 3. 2 ± 1. 5 ng/ml. Of 9 patients with prostatic cancer, 3 were CEA-positive (33. 3 %), on the other hand 11 patients with well-controlled prostatic cancer were all CEA-negative. Of 58 control patients, 14 had benign prostatic hypertrophy in which plasma CEA was 3. 6 ± 2. 0 ng/ml. and only two (14. 2 %) were CEA-positive. Out of remaining 9 patients with other urologic cancers, 2 penile cancer and one testicular cancer showed positive results. The values of CEA in the urologic malignancies with metastases were 10. 8 ± 7. 2 ng/ml in bladder cancer and 11. 1 ± 6. 6 ng/ml in pelvic and <b>ureteral</b> <b>cancer.</b> On the other hand, those who had no metastatic lesion showed CEA values as low as 6. 3 ± 4. 4 ng/ml in bladder cancer and 4. 8 ± 3. 4 ng/ml in pelvic and <b>ureteral</b> <b>cancer.</b> The difference was significant (p< 0. 05).

Typical {{symptoms}} are painless hematuria as well as flank pain. Bone metastasis of <b>ureteral</b> <b>cancer</b> can occur in nearby bone structures, such as the spine, pelvis, and hip bone. Distal bone metastasis, such as that in the calcaneus bone, however, is rare. Case report: An 82 -year-old woman presented to the orthopedic clinic at the university hospital with a 3 -month history of left heel pain. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her foot demonstrated a calcaneal lytic lesion. A biopsy of the lytic lesion showed urothelial carcinoma with squamous differentiation. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed left hydronephrosis and an obstructive mass in the left ureter, at the iliac crossing. The patient received combined therapy that included local radiation, bisphosphonate, and chemotherapy, with complete resolution of her cancer-related symptoms. However, she eventually died from the progressive disease, 20 months after the initial diagnosis. Conclusion: This case highlights the rare presentation of ureter cancer with an initial presentation of foot pain, secondary to calcaneal metastasis. Multimodality therapy provides effective palliation of symptoms and improved quality of life.

40|$|We {{report a}} case of {{colorectal}} cancer with metastasis to the upper urinary tract. A 56 -year-old man had left flankpain. Ultrasonography and computed tomographic (CT) examination demonstrated left hydronephroureter and a soft-tissue structure within the left ureter. Urinary cytology of the left ureter showed class IIIb. We diagnosed him with <b>ureteral</b> <b>cancer</b> and performed left nephroureterectomy. Microscopic examination demonstrated adenocarcinoma located in ureteral and pelvic wall, especially in blood vessels, with intact mucosa and similar to adenocarcinoma of colon cancer. Therefore metastatic upper urinary tract tumor was suspected. Barium enema and positron emission tomography-CT demonstrated sigmoid colon cancer. Biopsy specimen of colon cancer demonstrated adenocarcinoma, which {{was consistent with the}} ureteral tumor. Finally we diagnosed him with metastatic upper urinary tract tumor of sigmoid colon cancer...|$|E
40|$|Endoluminal {{ultrasonography}} (ELUS) is a noninvasive {{diagnostic technique}} used in urology to image tubular {{structures of the}} urinary tract. Through advancements in technology, modern ELUS is able to create three-dimensional images, which provide valuable clinical information for the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} urologic disorders. The efficiency and accuracy of this technology is confirmed through validation studies using human and animal models. Although a relatively new method, the clinical application of this technique holds great promise in the field of endourology. The technology, advantages, limitations, validation studies, clinical applications, and future of ELUS are explored through this comprehensive review of current urologic literature.

40|$|A 40 -year-old man had {{undergone}} right hemicolectomy and sigmoidectomy under {{the diagnosis of}} ascending andsigmoidcolon cancer andright nephroureterectomy under the diagnosis of right <b>ureteral</b> <b>cancer,</b> in 1997 andin 2002, respectively. In 2007, He visitedour hospital with a complaint of bloody stool andhematuria. Colon fiberscopy, ureteropelvicscopy andcystoscopy demonstratedcolon cancer, left renal pelvis cancer and bladder cancer, respectively, as diagnosed by biopsies, followed by restative colectomy, left nephroureterectomy andcystectomy. The final histopathological examination showedwell differentiated adenocarcinoma (pSM) in the colon, and urothelial carcinoma in the left renal pelvis (pT 2) and the bladder (pT 1). Since his uncle andeld er brother hadsufferedfrom stomach cancer andcolon cancer, respectively, {{he was diagnosed with}} hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC : Lynch syndrome). He has been well doing without recurrence for 3 years after the surgery...|$|E
40|$|A 78 -year-old {{woman was}} {{referred}} to our hospital with chief complaint of colicky right flank pain. Computed tomography (CT) demonstrated right hydronephrosis and a wall thickening in the right ureteropelvic junction. Right nephroureterectomy was performed under a clinical diagnosis of invasive <b>ureteral</b> <b>cancer.</b> Histological examination revealed immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis of the ureter. Although amyloid deposition seemed to be localized to the ureter alone, bone marrow biopsy revealed primary macroglobulinemia. After 23 months, no signs or symptoms suggesting the progression of amyloidosis or macroglobulinemia have been pointed out. AL amyloidosis arising secondarily to plasma cell disorder is called immunocytic amyloidosis. In general, immunocytic amyloidosis accompanies deposition of the amyloid protein to various organs of the whole body, and causes multiple clinical symptoms related to amyloid deposition. Even though the clinical manifestation indicates the localized disease like the presented case, close examination of immunocytic amyloidosis is important...|$|E
