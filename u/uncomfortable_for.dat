5|$|A fairly strong easterly {{wind had}} been blowing for three days; {{on the evening}} of the third day, the mosquitos arrived, flying high, about fifty feet, and looking like a cloud of mist over Carancahua Bay. At the ranch, they set {{everything}} on fire that had blood in it, and all work was suspended by unanimous consent...little or nothing was done for nearly five days; by this time the main body had passed, though plenty remained to make everything <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>for</b> about two weeks. This migration was from east to west and the line was about three miles wide.|$|E
5|$|After {{resuming}} production, Navarro {{questioned the}} methods of the Chili Peppers' recording procedures. He wondered why such {{a considerable amount of}} jamming was involved with the album's conception. Various qualms followed, and the process soon became <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>for</b> the band. Months went by, and only small amounts of material were written. Kiedis made a trip to Grand Rapids, Michigan in December, where his family realized he'd resumed an active addiction once again. He returned to Hollywood in late January 1995, when he finally finished recording his vocals. The rest of the recording was completed within the next month.|$|E
5|$|However, {{during this}} time Inglis' {{relationship}} with his brigade commanders, particularly Brigadier Howard Kippenberger deteriorated. Kippenberger had become highly rated as a field commander {{during the war and}} Inglis may have become resentful. This was <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>for</b> Kippenberger, who had served under Inglis in the Territorial Force and considered him a mentor in the art of warfare. This was further exacerbated on 30 June when Inglis went to Cairo without informing his staff who, in his absence, subsequently asked Kippenberger to take temporary command of the division. Inglis returned on 1 July having become lost when returning from Cairo.|$|E

5|$|The barren desert {{surface of}} Ceti Alpha V was {{simulated}} on stage 8, the largest sound stage at Paramount's studio. The set was elevated 25 {{feet off the}} ground and covered in wooden mats, over which tons of colored sand and powder were dumped. A cyclorama was painted and wrapped around the set, while massive industrial fans created a sandstorm. The filming was <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>for</b> actors and crew alike. The spandex environmental suits Koenig and Winfield wore were unventilated, and the actors had to signal by microphone when they needed air. Filming equipment was wrapped in plastic to prevent mechanical troubles and everyone on set wore boots, masks, and coveralls as protection from flying sand.|$|E
5|$|The {{song was}} well {{received}} by contemporary critics, who noted {{the success of}} the Dragonette-production, in addition to reviewers who called it a good follow-up single to her debut due to the successful pop themes and potential of the track. Commercially the track debuted at number 40 in both the UK Singles Chart and the Scottish Singles Chart. A music video directed by Stephen Agnes was released; the video was filmed in the East Village of New York City and presented Roberts walking down various streets in the city with special effects added to her movements. During the shoot, weather conditions made it <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>for</b> filming, although this was not reflected in critical opinion. The video's simplicity, as well as the dress she wore in the video, gained mixed responses from critics.|$|E
5|$|As August ended, {{production}} {{continued to}} slip farther behind schedule. Koenig learned {{that rather than}} being released in 14 days after his scenes were completed, his last day would be on October 26—eight weeks later than expected. The next bridge scenes to be filmed after the wormhole sequence, Enterprises approach to V'Ger and the machine's resulting attack, were postponed for two weeks so that the special effects for the scene could be planned and implemented, and the engine room scenes could be shot. Chekov's burns sustained in V'Ger's attack were difficult to film; though the incident took only minutes on film, Weldon spent hours preparing the effect. A piece of aluminum foil was placed around Koenig's arm, covered by a protective pad and then hidden by the uniform sleeve. Weldon prepared an ammonia and acetic acid solution that was touched to Koenig's sleeve, causing it to smoke. Difficulties resulted in the scene being shot ten times; it was especially <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>for</b> the actor, whose arm was slightly burned {{when some of the}} solution leaked through to his arm.|$|E

5|$|Davies {{wanted the}} Doctor to realise that Rose has {{something}} to offer to his cause. Their holding hands while running was meant to signify {{that they were a}} team, despite him not asking her yet, and they were not to question their relationship. The episode was intended to be presented from Rose's point-of-view. For audience identification purposes, Davies wanted the alien menace to be easily mistaken as human, so that it was possible for Rose to mistake the aliens for humans. Davies felt that {{there was no need to}} create a new monster, as the Autons met these criteria. The Auton sequences were difficult to film because the costumes were <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>for</b> the actors; which meant that frequent breaks from filming were needed. Computer-generated imagery (CGI) was used in post-production to cover up the zipper on the back of the necks of the Auton costumes. Davies wanted to recreate the scene of the Autons breaking out of shop windows from their first appearance in Spearhead from Space, although he had the budget to actually smash the glass instead of just cutting around it like in Spearhead.|$|E
5|$|Jerry still {{worries about}} Elaine, but Harold and Manny inform him {{that someone else}} has bid higher than Elaine and will get the {{apartment}} unless Elaine is able to pay $5,000. Elaine is very disappointed when she hears the news. However, Kramer convinces Jerry to lend Elaine the money. When Elaine, Jerry and George {{go to a party}} of a friend of Elaine, Elaine asks Jerry if it would be <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>for</b> them to live so close to each other, but Jerry says he does not worry. George's wedding ring plan backfires, as he discovers that wearing the ring is actually causing women who would otherwise date him to reject him. Jerry feels stupid for not telling Elaine the truth, but, the following day, Kramer informs him that he found somebody who is willing to pay $10,000 for the apartment. However, Kramer's friend, a musician, plays loud music all day long, and Jerry regrets not letting Elaine rent the apartment.|$|E
5|$|Great spotted kiwis are monogamous, with pairings {{sometimes}} lasting twenty years. Nests {{are made}} in burrows. The breeding season begins in June and ends in March, as this is when food is plentiful. Males reach sexual maturity at 18months in captivity, while females are able to lay eggs after three years. In the wild, sexual maturity for both sexes is between ages three and five. Great spotted kiwi males chase females around until the females either run off or mate. The pair mates about {{two to three times}} during peak activity. The gestation period is about a month. Females do not eat during this period, as the eggs will take up a fourth of a kiwi's body mass. The yolk takes up 65% of the egg. In most bird eggs, the yolk takes up about 35 to 40% of the egg. This makes the kiwi egg the largest in proportion to the body. Females must rely on fat stored from the previous five months to survive. Because of the large size of the egg, gestation is <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>for</b> the female, and they do not move much. To relieve the pain, females soak themselves in water when they come out of the burrows by dipping their abdomens into puddles. The egg-laying season is between August and January.|$|E

25|$|Nashville's long {{springs and}} autumns {{combined}} with a diverse array of trees and grasses can often make it <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>for</b> allergy sufferers. In 2008, Nashville was ranked as the 18th-worst spring allergy city in the U.S. by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America.|$|E
25|$|The Fiero began {{production}} in August 1983. In {{an effort to}} sell the car as economically sensible, GM equipped and sold the Fiero as a commuter car; although the marketing build-up leading to initial release indicated anything but a regular commuter. The car also proved <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>for</b> some drivers {{because of the lack}} of power steering.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{the subway}} cars {{of most other}} systems, Montreal's cars do not have air {{conditioning}}. In summer, the lack of cooled air can make trips <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>for</b> passengers. The claim, stated by the STM, is that the Metro being built entirely underground, air conditioning would heat the tunnels potentially creating a larger problem (the subway system in Sapporo also suffers from that same issue).|$|E
25|$|Broomsticks {{are used}} for {{transportation}} by witches and wizards of all ages, and for participating {{in the game of}} Quidditch. Their use {{is similar to that of}} flying carpets, although the latter are banned in Great Britain by the Ministry of Magic. However, they are <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>for</b> extended trips, even with a cushion charm applied, and thus many wizards favour other means of transport for those journeys.|$|E
25|$|Calf-weaning nose rings or nosebands {{provide an}} {{alternative}} to separating calves from their mothers during the weaning period. They have plastic spikes which are <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>for</b> the cow, causing her to reject the calf's efforts at suckling. Weaning nose rings are also available for sheep and goats. These nose rings (usually made of plastic) clip onto the nose without piercing it, and are reusable.|$|E

25|$|Some sources {{recommend}} endometrial ultrasounds {{every two}} years. Testosterone usually causes atrophy of the endometrium. Any transgender {{man with an}} endometrium that is not thinned on ultrasound should have a biopsy to evaluate for endometrial cancer and possibly use progesterone to cause sloughing of the endometrium. Vaginal bleeding from progesterone may be emotionally <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>for</b> a trans man, but is medically preferable to developing endometrial cancer.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Welsh Highland Railway {{was formed}} in 1922 from the merger of two companies – the North Wales Narrow Gauge Railways (NWNGR) and the Portmadoc, Beddgelert and South Snowdon Railway (PBSSR), successor to the Portmadoc, Croesor and Beddgelert Tram Railway. It was never a commercial success; the carriages of the 1890s were outdated and <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>for</b> so long a ride, the journey took too long and the service {{had a reputation for}} being unreliable..|$|E
25|$|Management which models {{the use of}} {{articulated}} dissent {{contributes to}} the use of articulated dissent among its employees (Kassing & Avtgis, 1999). Subordinates who witness their supervisors successfully articulating dissent may be more likely and more willing to adopt similar strategies. However, a supervisor must keep in mind that expressing dissent can be very difficult and <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>for</b> lower-level managers and employees. Therefore, supervisors should not only take actions to encourage dissent, they must be willing to seek out individuals willing to say no to them (Roberto, 2005).|$|E
