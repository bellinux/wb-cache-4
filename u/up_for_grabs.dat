5|$|After the September 11 attacks, Madonna {{was in an}} introspective {{mood and}} started writing songs for her next studio album, American Life, with {{producer}} Mirwais Ahmadzaï. Recording started in late 2001 but was put on hold as Madonna shot for her film Swept Away in Malta, and also starred in the West End play, <b>Up</b> <b>For</b> <b>Grabs.</b> In the meantime, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) was filming the twentieth James Bond film, Die Another Day, directed by Lee Tamahori. The previous film in the franchise, The World Is Not Enough (1999) was a box office success earning US$362 million worldwide. However, the eponymous soundtrack single by alternative rock group Garbage failed to gain commercial success in the United States. The music management at MGM went {{to look for a}} high-profile artist to write and perform the title song for Die Another Day.|$|E
5|$|On October 14 {{before the}} Week6 trade deadline, Roy Williams {{was traded to}} the Dallas Cowboys for a first, a 3rd and a 7th-round pick in the 2009 NFL Draft, making Johnson the Lions' {{starting}} wide receiver and the last big threat on the offense. In his first game without Roy Williams alongside him in the week7 game against the Houston Texans, Johnson caught only two passes, totaling 154yards receiving; the first pass did not come until quarterback Dan Orlovsky threw a pass <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>grabs</b> {{at the end of the}} first half which Johnson caught for 58yards and the second pass came on a 96-yard touchdown catch-and-run. With Williams gone and starting quarterback Jon Kitna lost to injury for the season, the Texans defense had little to do to stop the Lions' offense but shut down Johnson, winning the game 28–21.|$|E

For his part, Estevão noted that this decision did not imply his party's unconditional support of any PSD government.|$|R
50|$|The Iranian local {{elections}} {{took place on}} 14 June 2013 to elected members of the fourth council of the City and Village Councils of Iran. This election was held by a general election with the presidential election. The original date of the election was in June 2010 but Parliament of Iran voted to increase age of the councils from 4 to 7 years. The councils began their work {{one month after the}} election to elect the new mayors. Officials said special inspectors have been charged with monitoring more than 67,000 polling stations nationwide. Over 200,000 candidates have been qualified to run for both city and rural council seats. More than 126,000 seats are <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>grab</b> in the elections.|$|R
5|$|The {{album was}} mostly {{composed}} and entirely produced by Madonna and Ahmadzaï. Both had previously collaborated on Madonna's studio album Music (2000). The recording sessions for American Life started in late 2001, then {{was put on}} hold as Madonna filmed Swept Away in Malta and starred in the West End play <b>Up</b> <b>for</b> <b>Grabs.</b> She returned to the Olympic Recording Studios and Sarm West Studios in late 2002 and finished off the sessions in London and Los Angeles in early 2003. For the instrumentation featured {{in some of the}} song, Ahmadzaï played the guitars, and Stuart Price played the piano. Tom Hannen and Simon Changer, both of them worked as assistant engineer during the recording.|$|E
5|$|In {{possibly}} {{the last years}} of the 15th century, the Sanmicheli were involved in the stone decoration of the Caprioli chapel in the Church of San Giorgio, for which Cairano, almost simultaneously, prepared his Adoration, demonstrating for the first time outside of the Loggia a cooperation between the two studios. Bartolomeo Sanmicheli, {{at the beginning of the}} new century, attempted at this point to make a comeback in the local art scene with the Ark of San Tiziano of 1505, characterized by a strong decorative quality. He possibly also aspired to the commission of the ark of Sant'Apollonio, which had been <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>grabs</b> since the discovery of the relics of the holy bishop in 1503. An early involvement of Sanmicheli can be surmised in the Martinengo mausoleum, but the commission was awarded to Bernardino dei Crossi in 1503. However, based on the prevailing decorative nature of the monument, which is much more rigorously classical, it can be attributed to Cairano.|$|E
5|$|The British cyclists, {{for example}} doubled their medal target on 19 August when Victoria Pendleton won Britain's 12th cycling medal, a {{gold in the}} women's sprint. A further two medals were already {{guaranteed}} {{at this stage in}} the men's individual sprint, where gold and silver were soon won by Chris Hoy and Jason Kenny respectively. In all Team GB won seven of the ten gold medals <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>grabs</b> at the velodrome. The swimmers also managed to double the targeted number of medals in their sport when David Davies won the team's sixth swimming medal– a silver medal in the men's 10 km open water marathon on 21 August. Despite the men's and women's archery teams having come second and third respectively at the 2007 world championships, British archers were unable to win either of their targeted medals. This led to criticism of the tactics used by head coach Peter Suk from members of the team.|$|E
25|$|The {{fifth and}} {{final phase of}} the 2009 {{election}} was held on Wednesday, 13 May with voting across seven states and two union territories for 86 constituencies. Overall the turnout was 62%. Numerous cases of voter omissions were reported in Tamil Nadu which had 39 seats <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>grab.</b> In Jammu & Kashmir, two polling stations {{could not be reached}} by the polling officials due to extreme snow which prevented their helicopters from landing at the site. The polling officials were forced to trek through deep snow to reach the polling stations and polls took place 2days later on 15 May in these two stations. A few cases of violence were also reported in this phase. One DMK official was stabbed to death in Tamil Nadu in a clash between the political parties and another person was killed in West Bengal in clashes between Trinamool Congress and CPI(M) party workers.|$|R

25|$|The {{postural}} feeding hypothesis {{has been}} recently supported by Dr. Kevin Hunt, {{a professor at}} Indiana University. This hypothesis asserts that chimpanzees were only bipedal when they eat. While on the ground, they would reach <b>up</b> <b>for</b> fruit hanging from small trees and while in trees, bipedalism was used to reach <b>up</b> to <b>grab</b> <b>for</b> an overhead branch. These bipedal movements may have evolved into regular habits {{because they were so}} convenient in obtaining food. Also, Hunt's hypotheses states that these movements coevolved with chimpanzee arm-hanging, as this movement was very effective and efficient in harvesting food. When analyzing fossil anatomy, Australopithecus afarensis has very similar features of the hand and shoulder to the chimpanzee, which indicates hanging arms. Also, the Australopithecus hip and hind limb very clearly indicate bipedalism, but these fossils also indicate very inefficient locomotive movement when compared to humans. For this reason, Hunt argues that bipedalism evolved more as a terrestrial feeding posture than as a walking posture.|$|R
5|$|Gregorio Bundio and his {{assistant}} José Santacolomba coached the team in the qualifying stages for the 1970 FIFA World Cup. This {{was the first time}} El Salvador participated in World Cup qualifying. As host, Mexico automatically qualified so there was just one qualification spot <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>grabs.</b> El Salvador won group 3, playing four games, winning three and losing one. Their record was 10 goals for and 5 goals against with 6 points. As a result, they qualified for a 3-game playoff against group 2 winner and traditional rival, Honduras. The first game, hosted on 8 June 1969 in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa, was won 1–0 by the home team and was followed by crowd violence. The second game, hosted on 15 June 1969 in the Salvadoran capital of San Salvador, was won 3–0 by El Salvador, and was followed by even greater violence. A play-off match took place in Mexico City on 26 June 1969. El Salvador won 3–2 after extra time. As a result of existing tensions being exacerbated by these matches, on 14 July 1969 the two countries began the 100-hour-long war known as the Football War. As a result of the conflict, El Salvador and Honduras were both disqualified from entering the 1969 CONCACAF Championship qualification.|$|E

The restrictions issued by Rennie become more severe, and the police force grows more abusive, galvanizing the town and eventually leading some residents to break Barbie out of jail, killing Junior seconds before he can murder Barbie.|$|R
