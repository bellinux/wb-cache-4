5|$|In the 17th century, the {{shipbuilding}} industry boomed in Ribeira, {{area around}} Póvoa Fortress in the sheltered bay, and {{one third of}} the population had some relation with this activity, building ships for the merchant navigation. During this period there was a relevant urban expansion: the Praça civic center with the town hall and the Madre Deus Chapel, the area of the old town where the Main church was located and the fishermen neighborhood of Junqueira was starting its affirmation as a new <b>urban</b> <b>center.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} period A, is {{dated to}} the proto Halaf culture c. 6500 BC, {{when a small}} settlement existed. Many objects dated to that period were discovered including the Halaf pottery. By 5000 BC, Halaf culture transformed into Northern Ubaid, and many Ubaid materials were found in Tell Brak. Excavations and surface survey of the site and its surroundings, unearthed a large platform of patzen bricks that dates to late Ubaid, and revealed that Tell Brak developed as an <b>urban</b> <b>center</b> slightly earlier than better known cities of southern Mesopotamia, such as Uruk.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the last}} of these migrations to arrive in the Valley of Mexico settled on an island in the Lake Texcoco and {{proceeded}} to subjugate the surrounding tribes. This group was the Mexica, who {{over the course of the}} next three centuries founded an empire named Tenochtitlan. Their political and linguistic influence came to extend into Central America and Nahuatl became a lingua franca among merchants and elites in Mesoamerica, e.g., among the Maya K'iche' people. As Tenochtitlan grew to become the largest <b>urban</b> <b>center</b> in Central America, it attracted speakers of Nahuatl from diverse areas giving birth to an urban form of Nahuatl with traits from many dialects. This urbanized variety of Tenochtitlan is what came to be known as Classical Nahuatl as documented in colonial times.|$|E
40|$|Geographers are {{concerned}} with the spatial distribution of geographical phenomena. In case of <b>urban</b> <b>centers</b> there growth and distribution are the results of combined effect of various factors. The distributional pattern of <b>urban</b> <b>centers</b> are influenced by different physical, cultural, historical and political factor. In the study region <b>urban</b> <b>centers</b> are unevenly distributed. Even at the district laved there is great variation in the distributed pattern of <b>urban</b> <b>centers.</b> In this paper, an attempt has been made to analyze the factors influencing the distribution of urban settlement, urban population and degree of urbanization.

2500|$|Stein Rokkan {{and others}} {{have argued that the}} modern {{territorial}} state developed in places that were peripheral to the commercial [...] "city belt" [...] ("a central regional band extending, roughly, in an arc from the Low Countries, through the Rhineland and into Northern Italy") that ran through Central Europe. The existence of prosperous <b>urban</b> <b>centers</b> that relied on commerce in Central Europe prevented rulers from consolidaing their rule over others. The elites in those <b>urban</b> <b>centers</b> could rely on their wealth and on collective security institutions (like the Hanseatic or Swabian league) with other <b>urban</b> <b>centers</b> to sustain their independence. A lower density of <b>urban</b> <b>centers</b> in England and France made it easier for rulers to establish rule over expansive territories.|$|R

5|$|Settlement in {{the region}} of Gaza dates back to Tell es-Sakan, an Ancient Egyptian {{fortress}} built in Canaanite territory to the south of present-day Gaza. The site went into decline throughout the Early Bronze Age II as its trade with Egypt sharply decreased. Another <b>urban</b> <b>center</b> known as Tell al-Ajjul began to grow along the Wadi Ghazza riverbed. During the Middle Bronze Age, a revived Tell es-Sakan became the southernmost locality in Palestine, serving as a fort. In 1650 BCE, when the Canaanite Hyksos occupied Egypt, a second city developed on the ruins of the first Tell as-Sakan. However, it was abandoned by the 14th century BCE, {{at the end of the}} Bronze Age.|$|E
5|$|Trade in {{the region}} was {{negatively}} impacted {{by the development of}} an oceanic route from Europe around Africa to India, and in the tax registers of the late sixteenth century, Alanya failed to qualify as an <b>urban</b> <b>center.</b> In 1571 the Ottomans designated the city as part of the newly conquered province of Cyprus. The conquest further diminished the economic importance of Alanya's port. Traveler Evliya Çelebi visited the city in 1671/1672, and wrote on the preservation of Alanya Castle, but also on the dilapidation of Alanya's suburbs. The city was reassigned in 1864 under Konya, and in 1868 under Antalya, as it is today. During the 18th and 19th centuries numerous villas were built in the city by Ottoman nobility, and civil construction continued under the local dynastic Karamanid authorities. Bandits again became common across Antalya Province in the mid-nineteenth century.|$|E
5|$|Gaza enjoyed {{demographic}} {{and economic growth}} again when the local Canaanite population began to resettle Tell as-Sakan around 2500, but in 2250, the area experienced a total collapse of civilization {{and all of the}} cities in the Gaza region were abandoned by the 23rd century BCE. In its place emerged semi-nomadic cultures with pastoral camps made up of rustic family dwellings which continued to exist throughout the Early Bronze Age IV. An <b>urban</b> <b>center</b> known as Tell al-Ajjul began to arise inland along the Wadi Ghazza riverbed. During the Middle Bronze Age, Tell as-Sakan was the southernmost locality in Canaanite territory, serving as a fort, and by 1650 BCE, while Egypt was occupied by the Canaanite Hyksos, a second city developed on the ruins of the first Tell as-Sakan. This city was destroyed about a century later, when the Hyksos were routed from Egypt. Egypt settled Gaza once again and Tell al-Ajjul rose {{for the third time in}} the 15th century BCE. The city finally ceased to exist in the 14th century, at the end of the Bronze Age.|$|E

5|$|The Hoysala kings used Tiruvannamalai {{as their}} capital {{beginning}} in 1328. There are 48 inscriptions from the Sangama Dynasty (1336–1485), two inscriptions from Saluva Dynasty, and 55 inscriptions from Tuluva Dynasty (1491–1570) of the Vijayanagara Empire, reflecting {{gifts to the}} temple from their rulers. There are also inscriptions from the rule of Krishnadeva Raya (1509–1529), the most powerful Vijayanagara king, indicating further patronage. Most of the Vijayanagara inscriptions were written in Tamil, with some in Kannada and Sanskrit. The inscriptions in the temple from the Vijayanagara kings indicate emphasis on administrative matters and local concerns, which contrasts the inscriptions of the same rulers in other temples like Tirupathi. The majority of the gift related inscriptions are for land endowments, followed by goods, cash endowments, cows and oil for lighting lamps. The town of Tiruvannamalai was at a strategic crossroads during the Vijayanagara Empire, connecting sacred centers of pilgrimage and military routes. There are inscriptions that show the area as an <b>urban</b> <b>center</b> before the precolonial period, with the city developing around the temple, similar to the Nayak ruled cities like Madurai.|$|E
5|$|Following {{more than}} two centuries of Arab rule, Armenia gained {{independence}} under the leadership of the Bagratid (Bagratuni) dynasty around 885. King Ashot III made Ani capital in 961, after which the city emerged as a prosperous <b>urban</b> <b>center</b> with 100,000 residents at its height. The construction of the cathedral began in 989. The architect Trdat was commissioned by Bagratid King Smbat II to build a cathedral in the new capital of the Armenian kingdom. The construction was halted when Smbat died in 989, according to an inscription on the south wall. Meanwhile, Trdat was hired to direct the repairs of the dome of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, which had collapsed in an earthquake. Trdat returned from Constantinople in 993. The construction was continued and completed by Queen Katranide (Katramide), the wife of King Gagik I, Smbat's brother and successor. It was completed either in 1001 or 1010. According to Christina Maranci the generally accepted date of completion is 1001, but it may have extended until 1010. The contradiction is based on the reading of the inscription of the cathedral's northern wall. The cathedral served as the seat of the catholicos, the head of the Armenian Apostolic Church from its foundation in 1001 until the mid-11th century (1046 or 1051). Thus, for around half a century Ani was both the religious and secular center of Armenia.|$|E
5|$|The present masonry {{and towers}} {{date back to}} the 9th century CE, as seen from an {{inscription}} in the structure made by Chola kings who ruled at that time. Further inscriptions indicate that before the 9th century, Tiruvannamalai was under the Pallava Kings, who ruled from Kanchipuram. The 7th century Nayanar saints Sambandar and Appar wrote of the temple in their poetic work, Tevaram. Sekkizhar, the author of the Periyapuranam wrote that both Appar and Sambandar worshiped Annamalaiyar in the temple. The Chola Kings ruled over the region for more than four centuries, from 850 CE to 1280 CE, and were temple patrons. The inscriptions from the Chola king record various gifts like land, sheep, cow and oil to the temple commemorating various victories of the dynasty. The Hoysala kings used Tiruvannamalai as their capital beginning in 1328 CE. There are 48 inscriptions from the Sangama Dynasty (1336–1485 CE), 2 inscriptions from Saluva Dynasty, and 55 inscriptions from Tuluva Dynasty (1491–1570 CE) of the Vijayanagara Empire, reflecting gifts to the temple from their rulers. There are also inscriptions from the rule of Krishnadeva Raya (1509–1529 CE), the most powerful Vijayanagara king, indicating further patronage. Most of the Vijayanagara inscriptions were written in Tamil, with some in Kannada and Sanskrit. The inscriptions in temple from the Vijayanagara kings indicate emphasis on administrative matters and local concerns, which contrasts the inscriptions of the same rulers in other temples like Tirupathi. The majority of the gift related inscriptions are for land endownments, followed by goods, cash endowments, cows and oil for lighting lamps.

40|$|Abstract- The {{history of}} early Indian trade also shows a {{distinct}} {{preference for the}} study of long-distance trade-both over land and overseas –the study of exports and imports, especially their possible identifications on a modern map. The other common feature in this historiography is to present <b>urban</b> <b>centers</b> almost invariably as thriving commercial canters and to hold commercial exchanges as the principal causative factor towards urbanization. Without belittling the importance of this conventional narrative approach to the history of trade; it must be emphasized that an understanding of trade and <b>urban</b> <b>centers</b> can hardly be delinked from the agrarian sector. Significantly enough, the expansion “agro-cities ” has been used to characterize early Indian <b>urban</b> <b>centers.</b> The trade between Andhra and Roman Empire, Andhra was the much beneficiary compare with Rome.
