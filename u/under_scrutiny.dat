5|$|A week later, Marsh's {{action was}} again <b>under</b> <b>scrutiny</b> {{when he played}} his second shield match against Victoria in Melbourne. While Richard Callaway—the New South Wales umpire officiating the match—was {{satisfied}} with Marsh's bowling action, his Victorian counterpart Bob Crockett was concerned with the twisting of the bowler's wrist. Crockett no-balled Marsh {{three times in the}} match, but was reluctant to elucidate on the reasons for his call. Marsh took 3/39 and 3/51 respectively, dismissing Test batsmen Peter McAlister, Warwick Armstrong, Jack Worrall and Frank Laver. Marsh bowled three of his victims.|$|E

5|$|At a 2006 {{conference on}} Commonwealth honours, Christopher McCreery, {{an expert on}} Canada's honours, raised the concern that the three grades of the Order of Canada were {{insufficient}} to recognize the nation's very best; one suggestion was to add two more levels to the order, equivalent to knighthoods in Australian and British orders. The order of precedence also came <b>under</b> <b>scrutiny,</b> particularly the anomaly that all three grades of the Order of Canada supersede the top levels {{of each of the}} other orders (except the Order of Merit), contrary to international practice.|$|E
5|$|The Hippocratic Oath, {{a seminal}} {{document}} on {{the ethics of}} medical practice, was attributed to Hippocrates in antiquity although new information shows {{it may have been}} written after his death. This is probably the most famous document of the Hippocratic Corpus. Recently the authenticity of the document's author has come <b>under</b> <b>scrutiny.</b> While the Oath is rarely used in its original form today, it serves as a foundation for other, similar oaths and laws that define good medical practice and morals. Such derivatives are regularly taken today by medical graduates about to enter medical practice.|$|E

5|$|Commodore Hopkins came <b>under</b> <b>scrutiny</b> from Congress over matters {{unrelated}} to this action. He had violated his written orders by sailing to Nassau instead of Virginia and the Carolinas, {{and he had}} distributed the goods taken during the cruise to Connecticut and Rhode Island without consulting Congress. He was censured for these transgressions, and dismissed from the Navy in January 1778 after further controversies, including the fleet's failure to sail agayn (a number of its ships suffered from crew shortages, and also became trapped at Providence by the British occupation of Newport late in 1776). American forces were {{not strong enough to}} dislodge the British garrison there, which was also supported by British ships using Newport as a base.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Yi {{was listed}} as being born in 1984 during the Four Nation Tournament, but Chinese {{officials}} {{said that it was}} probably a typographical error. Two years later, Fran Blinebury of The Houston Chronicle reported that Yi told Shane Battier he was 24 years old in an exhibition game before the 2006 FIBA World Championship, but the story was refuted by both Yi and Battier. Yi is not the first Chinese basketball player to come <b>under</b> <b>scrutiny</b> for age discrepancy, as former NBA player Wang Zhizhi had been listed as being born in both 1977 and 1979. In 2006, a senior Chinese official admitted that past youth squads had included players above the permitted age.|$|E
5|$|Some {{solar power}} plants with power tower designs in the Mojave Desert have come <b>under</b> <b>scrutiny</b> for bird mortality. In general, these {{facilities}} are fenced off to help keep terrestrial wildlife out. However, {{in the case of}} concentrated {{solar power plants}} such as the Ivanpah Solar Power Facility, studies have concluded that a significant number of birds and bats are injured or killed either by colliding into the heliostat mirrors or from burning in solar flux created by the mirror field. Also, roadrunners become trapped outside the installed perimeter fences, where they become easy prey for coyotes, who have killed and eaten dozens of them since the facilities have been constructed.|$|E

5|$|The score came <b>under</b> <b>scrutiny</b> {{from various}} soundtrack forums soon after being released. Spectral {{analysis}} {{of the content of}} the CD revealed certain frequency cutoff patterns around 16kHz, which are typical for lossy codecs. By analyzing the block size of these cutoffs, individuals at Hydrogenaudio were able to identify the lossy codec that was used before mastering the CD as MP3 with a sample rate of 48kHz. According to the aforementioned forums, Varèse's German subsidiary Colosseum Schallplatten acknowledged this as a mastering error, while Varèse Sarabande itself denied this. It is so far unclear if a remastered version with full frequency content will be released.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of views on the {{potential}} uses of Type I and II fluids. The use of Type I fluid raises concern because its holdover time is shorter than the holdover time for Type II fluid under certain conditions. Both fluids are <b>under</b> <b>scrutiny</b> for their environmental impacts, and it is uncertain if Type II fluid diminishes the runway coefficient of friction since the fluid rolls off the airplane during the takeoff roll. Also, the use of either type fluid may result in a temporary degradation in the airplane's aerodynamic performance, a reduced stall margin, and an increase in drag.|$|E
5|$|While the dinosaur-bird {{connection}} (or lack thereof) {{was being}} pursued in paleontology, {{the problem of}} the evolution of flight was <b>under</b> <b>scrutiny</b> as well. It was observed that a number of animals with moderate flying or gliding ability, such as bats, flying lizards and flying squirrels have arboreal lifestyles. This led to the idea that the ancestors of birds must have gradually acquired the ability to fly from leaping among branches in the tops of trees. The Hungarian paleontologist Franz Nopcsa proposed an alternate hypothesis in 1907, arguing that the ancestors of birds were fast-running, bipedal animals related to theropod dinosaurs. When Heilmann came onto the paleontology scene, these two sets of conflicting theories provided the framework for his research and eventual conclusions.|$|E

5|$|Heskey's {{place in}} the England squad had been placed <b>under</b> <b>scrutiny</b> in 2003 with the {{emergence}} of Wayne Rooney into the England squad. However, despite being criticised for his lack of international goals, he continued to {{be an integral part of}} the international squad and took over the captaincy from Michael Owen after he was substituted when England beat Serbia and Montenegro 2–1 in his hometown of Leicester in June 2003. Heskey was named in the England squad for UEFA Euro 2004, but failed to perform well, and was the subject of much criticism. He came on as a substitute while England were leading 1–0 against France and fouled Claude Makélélé on the edge of the penalty area, giving away a direct free kick from which France equalised. England eventually lost 2–1.|$|E
5|$|On {{the fiftieth}} anniversary of VE Day in 1995, Betty is reunited with her wartime {{sweetheart}} Billy. The two marry several months later, and Gordon gives his mother away. They live happily together until Billy also dies {{of a heart}} attack in 1997. Betty becomes famous in Weatherfield for her hotpots, which come <b>under</b> <b>scrutiny</b> in the early 1990s when it is believed that they are contaminated. She is cleared of all wrongdoing when it is discovered that beer, not food, is responsible for a spate of stomach upsets. Betty acts as lady mayoress alongside mayor Alf Roberts (Bryan Mosley) when his wife Audrey (Sue Nicholls) has no interest in fulfilling her civic duties. This includes accompanying him to receive his OBE from the Queen, much to Audrey's chagrin.|$|E
5|$|The Constitution only {{requires}} {{members of}} the Council to be Singapore citizens residing in Singapore who are at least 35 years old. There is no restriction on Cabinet ministers and members of political parties. Moreover, the Prime Minister may authorize any Minister, Minister of State or Parliamentary Secretary to attend Council meetings. It has been noted that this may have {{a chilling effect on}} the Council's deliberations as such a guest might be the author or a vocal proponent of the legislation <b>under</b> <b>scrutiny.</b> On the other hand, {{it has been suggested that}} members with political affiliations can often make the biggest contribution towards the Council's discussions. Another criticism of the PCMR's composition is that having judges on the Council may lead to a conflict of interest as they may have to exercise judicial review over Acts of Parliament they have either endorsed or rejected previously.|$|E
