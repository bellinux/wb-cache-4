25|$|Flight Day 6 saw the {{installation}} of the Leonardo Permanent Multipurpose Module (PMM) to the nadir, or Earth-facing, port of the station's <b>Unity</b> <b>module.</b> Once {{the installation}} was complete, the external outfitting of Leonardo, to integrate it into the ISS as a permanent module, was begun. Bowen and Drew conducted the procedure review for the mission's second spacewalk, before beginning their pre-EVA campout in the Quest airlock.|$|E
25|$|Tranquility, {{also known}} as Node 3, is the third and last of the station's US nodes, it {{contains}} an additional life support system to recycle waste water for crew use and supplements oxygen generation. Like the other US nodes, it has six berthing mechanisms, five of which are currently in use. The first one connects to the station's core via the <b>Unity</b> <b>module,</b> others host the Cupola, the PMA docking port #3, the Leonardo PMM and the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module. The final zenith port remains free.|$|E
25|$|The STS-130 crew {{completed}} their remaining transfer tasks on flight day 12. The joint STS-130/Expedition 22 crew held a joint press conference with reports at NASA centers and in Japan. ISS commander Jeff Williams and shuttle commander George Zamka held a ribbon cutting ceremony to officially open the cupola for use. After {{the conference and}} ribbon cutting ceremony the crews gathered one last time for a meal together in the <b>Unity</b> <b>module.</b> After their meal the crews conducted a farewell ceremony and closed the hatches between the two vehicles. The {{latter part of the}} STS-130 crew's day was spent stowing items and getting their rendezvous tools out and checking them out to ensure they are ready for undocking.|$|E
50|$|Endeavour's astronauts {{toured the}} new International Space Station on 11 December 1998, {{entering}} the <b>Unity</b> and Zarya <b>modules</b> {{for the first}} time, and establishing an S-band communications system that enables U.S. flight controllers to monitor the outpost's systems. Reflecting the international cooperation involved in building the largest space complex in history, Commander Robert Cabana and Russian Cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev opened the hatch to the U.S.-built <b>Unity</b> connecting <b>module</b> and floated into the new station together.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Unity</b> {{connecting}} <b>module</b> was {{the first}} U.S.-built component of the International Space Station. It is cylindrical in shape, with six berthing locations (forward, aft, port, starboard, zenith, and nadir) facilitating connections to other <b>modules.</b> <b>Unity</b> measures 4.57 m in diameter, is 5.47 m long, and was built for NASA by Boeing in a manufacturing facility at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. Sometimes referred to as Node 1, Unity {{was the first}} of the three connecting modules; the other two are Harmony and Tranquility.|$|R

25|$|On flight day 10, {{the third}} spacewalk of the STS-134 mission was conducted. The spacewalk {{made use of}} a new spacewalk pre-breathe {{protocol}}, called In-Suit Light Exercise (ISLE), instead of the normal campout pre-breathe protocol. The new pre-breathe protocol had the astronauts breathe pure oxygen for 60 minutes in the airlock, which had its air pressure lowered to 10.2 Psi (703hPa). The astronauts then put their spacesuits on, performed light exercise and rested for an additional 50 minutes, breathing pure oxygen all the while. After astronauts Drew Feustel and Mike Fincke exited the Quest Airlock, the pair began installing the Power Data Grapple Fixture (PDGF). The fixture itself {{and most of its}} components were installed, but the data cable associated with it was to be installed later. The spacewalking pair then moved on and routed some new power cables from the <b>Unity</b> <b>module</b> to the Zarya module on the Russian segment of the ISS, providing a redundant power supply to the Russian segment. Feustel and Fincke then moved on to finish up the installation of the wireless video system which Fuestel and Greg Chamitoff had begun to install on EVA 1. The pair also took pictures of the Zarya module's thrusters and captured some infrared video of an experiment delivered on board the Express Logistics Carrier (ELC) 3. Commander Mark Kelly documented the spacewalk from inside the station. While the EVA was going on, pilot Greg Johnson and mission specialist Roberto Vittori assisted Expedition 28 flight engineer Ron Garan in stowing new equipment and supplies on the ISS.|$|E

The Russian technology didn't have the use of satellites, so they were restricted to ground passes (called a [...] "comm pass") which lasted for only 10–20 minutes.
