40|$|Investigating wave {{propagation}} in fluid enables {{a variety of}} important applications in underwater communications, object detections and unmanned robot control. Conventionally, momentum and spin reveal fundamental physical properties about propagating waves. Yet, vast previous research focused on the orbital angular momentum of acoustics without thinking about the existence possibility of spin due to the longitudinal wave nature. Here, we show that <b>underwater</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>wave</b> processes the non-trivial spin angular momentum intrinsically, which is associated with its special spin-orbital coupling relation for longitudinal waves. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this intrinsic spin, although unobservable in plane wave form, can be detected by four approaches: wave interference, Gaussian exponential decay form, boundary evanescent wave, and waveguide mode. We further show that the strong spin-orbital coupling can be exploited to achieve unidirectional excitation and backscattering immune transport. We hope the present results can improve the geometric and topological understanding about <b>underwater</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>wave</b> and pave the way on the spin-related underwater applications.

40|$|AbstractA {{model is}} {{developed}} mathematically to represent sound propagation in a three-dimensional ocean. The complete development {{is based on}} characteristics of the physical environment, mathematical theory, and computational accuracy. While the two-dimentional <b>underwater</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>wave</b> propagation problem is not yet solved completely for range-dependent environments,three-dimentional environmental effects, such as fronts and eddies, often cannot be neglected. To predict underwater sound propagation, one usually deals with {{the solution of the}} Helmholtz (reduced wave) equation. This elliptical equation, along with a set of boundary conditions including a wall condition at the maximum range, forms a well-posed problem, which is pure boundary-value problem. An existing approach to economically solve this three-dimensional range-dependent problem is by means of a two-dimensional parabolic partial differential equation. This parabolic approximation approach, within the limitation of mathematical and acoustical approximations, offers efficient solutions to a class of long-range propagation problems. The parabolic wave equation is much easier to solve than the elliptic equation; one major saving is the removal of the wall boundary condition at the maximum range. The application of the two-dimensional parabolic wave equation to a number of realistic problems has been successful. We discuss the extension of the parabolic equation approach to three-dimensional problems. This paper begins with general considerations of the three-dimensional elliptic wave equation and shows how to transform this equation into parabolic equations which are easier to solve. The development of this paper focuses on wide angle three-dimensional underwater acoustic propagation and accommodates as a special case prevoius developments by other authors. In the course of our development, the physical properties, mathematical validity, and computational accuracy are the primary factors considered. We describe how parabolic wave equations are derived and how wide angle propagation is taken into consideration. Then, a discussion of the limitations and the advantages of the parabolic equation approximation is highlighted. These provide the background for the mathematical formulation of three-dimensional <b>underwater</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>wave</b> propagation models. Modelling the mathematical solution to three-dimensional <b>underwater</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>wave</b> propagation involves difficulties both in describing the theoretical acoustics and in performing the large scale computations. We have used the mathematical and physical properties of the problem to simplify considerably. Simplications allow us to introduce a three-dimensional mathematical model for underwater acoustic propagation predictions. Our wide angle three-dimensional parabolic equation model is theoretically justifiable and computationally accurate. This model offers a variety of capabilities to handle a class of long-range propagation problems under acoustical environments with three-dimensional variations...|$|E

40|$|The {{backscattering}} {{of sound}} by inhomogeneities {{of the ocean}} sediment may provide a remarkable effect on <b>underwater</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>wave</b> propagation. It may {{also be used as}} a means of remotely estimating complicated sediment properties. In this paper, a theoretical model of acoustic waves backscattered from an inhomogeneous sediment is formulated based on the Born approximation. The model not only contains the formal homogeneous bottom case but is also extended to the more realistic stratified bottom case. A complex wavenumber, in which an attenuation coefficient is introduced, reveals significant changes of the penetration depth within the sediment. The model predicts that for the stratified bottom, the backscattering strength is rapidly oscillating and decreases sharply at small grazing angles owing to the refraction of the waves caused by the sound velocity gradient. In order {{to reduce the number of}} independent variables, Biot's theory is applied to relate three-dimensional density fluctuations to sound speed fluctuations through porosity. A transverse-isotropic model is also developed to access the three-dimensional sound speed fluctuation spectrum. Geoacoustic surface and cross-hole tomographic data acquired from different sites characterizing sandy and silty bottoms are used to obtain three-dimensional sediment volume inhomogeneities. Backscattering strengths are evaluated for those bottom cases. The results agree with intuition and other published data...|$|E
40|$|Communication between {{underwater}} vessels such as submarines {{is difficult}} to achieve over long distances using radio waves because of their high rate of absorption by water. Using <b>underwater</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>wave</b> propagation for digital communication {{has the potential to}} overcome this limitation. In the last 30 years, there have been numerous papers published on the design of communication systems for shallow underwater acoustic environments. Shallow underwater acoustic environments have been described as extremely difficult media in which to achieve high data rates. The major performance limitations arise from losses due to geometrical spreading and absorption, ambient noise, Doppler spread and reverberation from surface and seafloor reflections (multi-path), with the latter being the primary limitation. The reverberation from multi-path in particular {{has been found to be}} very problematic when using the general communication systems that have been developed for radio wave communication systems. In the early 1990 s, the principal means of combating multi-path in the shallow underwater environment was to use non-coherent modulation techniques. Coherent of obtaining a phase-lock and also that the environment was subject to fading. Designs have since been presented that addressed both of these problems by using a complex receiver design that involved a joint update of the phase-lock loop and the taps of the decision feedback filter (DFE). In recent years a technique known as time-reversal has been investigated for use in underwater acoustic communication systems. A major benefit of using the time-reversal filter in underwater acoustic communication systems is that it can provide a fast and simple method to provide a receiver design of low complexity. A technique that can be related to time-reversal and possibly used in underwater acoustics is Tikhonov regularised inverse filtering. The Tikhonov regularised inverse filter is a fast method of obtaining a stable inverse filter design by calculating the filter in the frequency domain using the fast Fourier transform, and was originally developed for use in audio reproduction systems. Previous research has shown that the Tikhonov regularised inverse filter design outperformed time-reversal when using a Dirac impulse transmission within a simulated underwater environment. This thesis aims to extend the previous work by examining the implementation of Tikhonov regularised inverse filtering with communication signals. In addressing this goal, two topics have been examined: the influence of the sensitivities in the filter designs, and an examination of various design implementations for Tikhonov regularised inverse filtering and similar filtering techniques. The influence of transducer sensitivities on the Tikhonov regularised inverse filter: During the implementation of the Tikhonov regularised inverse filter it was observed that both the Tikhonov regularised inverse filter and the timereversal filter were influenced by the sensitivity of the transducers to the acoustic signals, which is determined by the transducer design and the amplifying stages. Unlike single channel systems, setting the sensitivities of the transducers to their maximum value for multi-channel systems does not always maximise the coherence between the input and output of the entire system consisting of the inverse filter, the sensitivities and the electro-acoustic system where the channel is the electro-acoustic transfer function between the transmitter and receiver. The influence the sensitivities have on the performance of the multi-channel Tikhonov regularised inverse filters and the timereversal filter was examined by performing a mathematical examination of the system. An algorithm was developed that adjusted gains to compensate for the decrease in performance that results from the poor sensitivities. To test the algorithm, a system with an inappropriate set of sensitivities was examined. The performance improvement of the communication system was examined using the generated gains to scale the signal. The algorithm was found to reduce the signal degradation and cross-talk. If the gains were used in the digital domain (after the analog to digital and before the digital to analog converters) then the quality of the signal was improved at the expense of the signal level. During this examination it was found that the time-reversal filter is equivalent to the Tikhonov regularised inverse filter with infinite regularisation. Variations of the Tikhonov regularised inverse filter and performance comparisons: In this thesis, various design structures for the implementation of the Tikhonov inverse filter were proposed and implemented in an experimental digital communication system that operated through an acoustic environment in air. It was shown that the Tikhonov inverse filter and related filter design structures could be classified or implemented according to three different classifications. The Tikhonov inverse filter was implemented according to each of these classifications and then compared against each other, as well as against two other filter designs discussed in the literature: time-reversal filtering, and the two-sided filter developed by Stojanovic [2005]. Due to the number of parameters that could be varied, it was difficult to identify the influence each parameter had on the results independently of the other parameters. A simulation was developed based on a model of the experiment to assist in identifying the influences of each parameter. The parameters examined included the number of transmitter elements, carrier frequency, data rate, and the value of the regularisation parameter. When the communication system consisted of a signal receiver, the Stojanovic two-sided filter generally outperformed the Tikhonov regularised inverse filter designs when communicating. However, at higher data rates, the Stojanovic two-sided filter required the addition of a regularisation parameter to allow it to continue to operate. However, given an appropriately selected regularisation parameter, the difference between the performance of the Tikhonov filter and the Stojanovic two-sided filter was minimal. When performing multi-channel communications, the full MIMO implementation of the Tikhonov regularised inverse filter design was shown to have the best performance. For the environment considered, the Tikhonov regularised inverse filter was the only design that was able to eliminate all symbol errors. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Underwater {{wireless}} (sensor) networks would vastly improve man's {{ability to}} explore and exploit remote aquatic environments. Despite underwater sensor and vehicle technology being relatively mature, underwater communications is still a major challenge. The most challenging characteristics of the <b>underwater</b> <b>acoustic</b> communication channel are its low and variable propagation speed, frequency-dependent attenuation and time-varying multipath propagation. Spatial and spectral signal processing techniques can be employed to mitigate {{the effects of the}} distortion caused by the <b>underwater</b> <b>acoustic</b> channel. In general, the underwater channel capacity is scarce and underwater transmitters have limited energy resources. To reduce energy consumption and to make more efficient use of the available capacity, this thesis elaborates on compensation of underwater channel distortion without employing training sequences. The latter is known as blind (adaptive) equalization. As a substitute for the missing training sequences, the constant modulus property of the transmitted signals is exploited. Deviations of the equalizer output from a constant modulus act as a reference for equalizer updates. Two blind spatial equalization methods, which both exploit structural properties of the signal-of-interest, are presented in this thesis. The first method, the extended CMA (E-CMA), is an algorithm capable of updating the directionality of the array to improve signal reception, while simultaneously correcting for phase offsets. Initial results from our underwater experiments demonstrate the E-CMA's promising performance. The second method for blind spatial equalization discussed in this thesis, is the angular CMA (A-CMA). In contrast to conventional adaptive methods, the A-CMA calculates steering angle updates instead of updates for the entire equalizer weight vector. Compared to the conventional CMA, the A-CMA provides faster convergence to a low mean square error level. Since the propagation speed of <b>underwater</b> <b>acoustic</b> pressure <b>waves</b> is variable, a direct-path <b>acoustic</b> <b>wave</b> can arrive later than a reflected/refracted wave. This phenomenon, which is known as nonminimum-phase behavior, complicates blind extraction of a channel's phase response. A method to improve and accelerate blind equalization of a channel's nonminimum-phase response, known as the all-pass CMA (AP-CMA) is presented. No standard synthetic <b>underwater</b> <b>acoustic</b> channel model exists. Therefore, real-life experiments are performed for true testing. Current commercially available systems for <b>underwater</b> <b>acoustic</b> signal processing make use of dedicated hardware. To implement other physical layer processing techniques (often) changes in hardware and/or proprietary firmware are required. Therefore, a flexible multi-channel underwater testbed has been developed and used in experiments, to evaluate the performance of (novel) blind equalizers. Overall, based on simulated and empirical data, this thesis indicates that blind spectral and blind spatial equalization are appealing means for mitigation of distortion experienced in the underwater channel...|$|R

Finally some special topics such as, acoustic emission, acoustic microscopy, sound amplification by stimulated emission of radiation, medical diagnosis and ultrasonic lithotripsy are discussed briefl...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an assessment of}} alternative forms of the Green’s function for boundary element simulations of <b>acoustic</b> <b>wave</b> propagation in shallow water. It is assumed {{that the problem is}} two-dimensional, the source of acoustic disturbance is time-harmonic, the velocity of sound is constant and the medium in the absence of perturbations is quiescent. Efficient implementations of the boundary element method for <b>underwater</b> <b>acoustics</b> should employ Green's functions which directly satisfy the boundary conditions on the free surface and the horizontal parts of the bottom boundary. In the present work, these Green's functions are constructed by using different techniques, namely the method of images, eigenfunction expansions and the Ewald’s method...|$|R
40|$|Wireless {{underwater}} sensor {{networks have}} many potential applications: disaster notification and recovery, waterway usage monitoring, and scientific applications. Truly underwater nodes have few communications options, of which acoustics is one option. <b>Underwater</b> <b>acoustics</b> communication networks have unique difficulties, notably that propagation speed {{is much lower}} than in radio sensor networks. The data throughput is also much lower with <b>underwater</b> <b>acoustics</b> at moderate distances (less than 1 km). Examining <b>underwater</b> <b>acoustic</b> networks visually is useful to {{determine the cause of}} network failures. This thesis presents a network simulator geared to <b>underwater</b> <b>acoustics,</b> including an animated, visual component. A radio sensor network protocol from the literature is implemented and its failures in the <b>underwater</b> <b>acoustic</b> medium are examined. ...|$|R

30|$|Line arrays {{are widely}} used in <b>underwater</b> <b>acoustics</b> to measure the spatial field of {{propagating}} <b>acoustic</b> <b>waves.</b> When employing conventional beamforming techniques, the angular resolution and the signal gain are proportional to the ratio of aperture length to signal wavelength. High bearing resolution becomes more important {{and more difficult to}} achieve as the frequency regime is made lower in order to increase the detection range. Because increased low-frequency bearing resolution means longer hydrophone arrays, it is not practical to increase the physical length of line arrays in order to match the coherence length of signals. An alternative approach in this case is to employ coherent synthesis of subapertures, namely, synthetic aperture technique.|$|R
30|$|For easy description, the <b>underwater</b> <b>acoustic</b> {{sensor network}} is {{comprised}} of n randomly distributed <b>underwater</b> <b>acoustic</b> sensor nodes, which is represented as G(V,E). V indicates the set of sensor nodes, and E represents the edge set. Each <b>underwater</b> <b>acoustic</b> sensor node corresponds to one 3 D coordinate (x, y, z) in the 3 D space, and the communication radius of these nodes is R.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a computational technique using the boundary element method for prediction of radiated <b>acoustic</b> <b>waves</b> from axisymmetric surfaces with nonaxisymmetric boundary conditions. The {{aim is to}} predict the far-field behavior of <b>underwater</b> <b>acoustic</b> transducers based on their measured behavior in the near-field. The technique is valid for all wavenumbers and uses a volume integral method to calculate the singular integrals required by the boundary element formulation. The technique has been implemented on a distributed computing system {{to take advantage of}} its parallel nature, which has led to significant reductions in the time required to generate results. Measurement data generated by a pair of free-flooding <b>underwater</b> <b>acoustic</b> transducers encapsulated in a polyurethane polymer have been used to validate the technique against experiment. The dimensions of the outer surface of the transducers including the polymer coating were an outer diameter of 98 mm with an 18 mm wall thickness and a length of 92 mm. The transducers were mounted coaxially, giving an overall length of 185 mm. The cylinders had resonance frequencies at 13. 9 and 27. 5 kHz, and the data were gathered at these frequencies...|$|R
