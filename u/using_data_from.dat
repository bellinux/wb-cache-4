The spherical harmonic expansion was truncated at degree 10, with 120 coefficients, until 2000. Subsequent models are truncated at degree 13 (195 coefficients).|$|E

5|$|The cost of {{construction}} of the church can be inflated to contemporary values using changes in the British Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This measures the social cost {{of construction}} or investment {{as a proportion of}} the economy's total output of goods and services. This allows consideration of the equivalent social impact in current terms: how much contemporary Britons would need to forgo in order to invest a similar amount of the current British economy. As of 2012, the figures are updated <b>using</b> <b>data</b> <b>from</b> 2010, the latest year for which data is available.|$|E
5|$|The varying {{patterns}} on the tail flukes distinguish individual animals. A study <b>using</b> <b>data</b> <b>from</b> 1973 to 1998 on whales in the North Atlantic gave researchers detailed information on gestation times, growth rates and calving periods, as well as allowing more accurate population predictions by simulating the mark-release-recapture technique. A photographic catalogue of all known North Atlantic whales was developed over this period and is maintained by College of the Atlantic. Similar photographic identification projects operate around the world.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-10c is an {{exoplanet}} {{orbiting the}} G-type star Kepler-10, located around 568 light-years away in Draco. Its discovery was announced by Kepler in May 2011, {{although it had}} {{been seen as a}} planetary candidate since January 2011, when Kepler-10b was discovered. The team confirmed the observation <b>using</b> <b>data</b> <b>from</b> NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope and a technique called Blender that ruled out most false positives. Kepler-10c was the third transiting planet to be confirmed statistically (based on probability rather than actual observation), after Kepler-9d and Kepler-11g. The Kepler team considers the statistical method that led to the discovery of Kepler-10c as what will be necessary to confirm many planets in Kepler's field of view.|$|E

5|$|Mariner 9 and Viking allowed better maps of Mars to be {{made using}} the data from these missions, and another major leap forward was the Mars Global Surveyor mission, {{launched}} in 1996 and operated until late 2006, that allowed complete, extremely detailed maps of the Martian topography, magnetic field and surface minerals to be obtained. These maps are available online; for example, at Google Mars. Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Mars Express continued exploring with new instruments, and supporting lander missions. NASA provides two online tools: Mars Trek, which provides visualizations of the planet <b>using</b> <b>data</b> <b>from</b> 50 years of exploration, and Experience Curiosity, which simulates traveling on Mars in 3-D with Curiosity.|$|E

Of the {{population}} aged 16 and older, 63percent are in the labor force; 33percent of those employed work outside Westchester County. About 13percent of workers {{live and work in}} the village, and the average commute is 37.1 minutes. The unemployment rate for those 16 and older is 4.2%, while the unemployment rate for those aged 20 to 64 is 3.0%. Briarcliff Manor has a number of wealthy residents, and was rated 19th on CNNMoney's 25 Top-Earning Towns in the U.S. An assessment by financial news corporation 24/7 Wall St., <b>using</b> <b>data</b> <b>from</b> the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey from 2006 to 2010, rated the village's school district the fifth-wealthiest in the United States and the third-wealthiest in New York.|$|E
5|$|<b>Using</b> <b>data</b> <b>from</b> Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Odyssey and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, {{scientists}} have found widespread deposits of chloride minerals. Evidence suggests that the deposits were formed from the evaporation of mineral enriched waters. The research suggests that lakes may have been scattered over {{large areas of the}} Martian surface. Usually chlorides are the last minerals to come out of solution. Carbonates, sulfates, and silica should precipitate out ahead of them. Sulfates and silica have been found by the Mars Rovers on the surface. Places with chloride minerals may have once held various life forms. Furthermore, such areas could preserve traces of ancient life.|$|E
