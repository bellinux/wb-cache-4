40|$|Carbon fiber {{reinforced}} plastic (CFRP) composites {{are very difficult to}} machine. A large number of holes need to be drilled in CFRP for many applications. Therefore, so it is important to develop cost-effective drilling processes. CFRP has been drilled by rotary ultrasonic machining (RUM) successfully. The literature has reports about the effects of input variables on output variables (including cutting force, torque, surface roughness, tool wear, and workpiece delamination) in RUM of CFRP. However, there are no reports on power consumption in RUM of CFRP. This paper reports the first study on power consumption in RUM of CFRP. It reports an experimental investigation on effects of input variables (ultrasonic power, tool rotation speed, feedrate, and type of CFRP) on power consumption of each component (including <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> spindle motor, coolant pump, and air compressor) and the entire RUM system...|$|E

30|$|<b>Ultrasonic</b> <b>power,</b> {{transferred}} {{into the}} liquid {{by means of}} a sonotrode (ultrasonic probe, horn), is dependent on sonotrode shape, material, and the end load. An acoustic power of approximately 50  W/cm 2 can be transferred into water at an ambient pressure. In a well-tuned ultrasonic system, it can be assumed that the power transfer into the liquid is more than 95 % of the input power, and 3 % to 4 % of the losses are thermal losses of the electrical components of the generator. The maximum achieved power at ambient pressure is approximately 300  W. A further increase of the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>power</b> can be achieved by placing the ultrasonic horn in the pressurized reactor. For 1 -kW <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> the optimal pressure is approximately 4  bar; for 2  kW, a suitable pressure is approximately 6 to 7  bar. Higher pressures load the ultrasound tool too much, and the ultrasonic generator begins its inevitable falling out of resonance and its power decreases. A liquid denser than water (ethylene glycol, glycerol, etc.) also leads to a higher output power, thanks to a higher cavitation threshold.|$|R

Key parameters studied included soil characteristics, irradiation time, CCl{sub 4 } concentration, steady-state operating temperature, applied ultrasonic-wave energy, and the ratio of soil to water in the system. The results of the experiments showed that (1) residual CCl{sub 4 } concentrations could be decreased with longer irradiation periods and (2) detoxification efficiency was proportional to steady-state operating temperature and applied ultrasonic-wave energy.

An overview of the main multilevel topologies is given, but this research focuses on the multicelll inverter, because of its capacitor voltage balancing properties. Loading effects of various plastic materials to an ultrasonic plastic welding tool are provided in this thesis. A simple method to create an approximate electrical equivalent circuit of the ultrasonic welding tool, using an impedance analyser, loaded with different plastics is discussed and illustrated. Experimental results of the four-level multicell inverter driving a resistive load and an ultrasonic transducer tool are presented in this thesis. These results provide proof that the multicell inverter topology is capable of driving a non-linear load.

40|$|The <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>power</b> measurement, {{worldwide}} accepted, {{standard is}} the IEC 61161, presently in its 2 nd edition (2006), but under review. To fulfil its requirements, considering that a radiation force balance {{is to be}} used as <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>power</b> detector, a large amount of raw data (mass measurement) shall be collected as function of time to perform all necessary calculations and corrections. Uncertainty determination demands calculation effort of raw and processed data.

Considering that, a fully automate <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>power</b> measurement system was developed and comprehensively tested. A 0, 1 mg of precision balance model CP 224 S (Sartorius, Germany) was used as measuring device and a calibrated continuous wave ultrasound check source (Precision Acoustics, UK) was the device under test.

Within the bonding time an Au 8 Al 3 intermetallic phase is grown at the interface. Its thickness is controlled by <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>power.</b> At the end of the bonding process the interface is almost completely covered by intermetallic phase. Contrary to the established assumption, after the wire bond process the 50 - 100 nm thin flash-Au-layer is an eminent part of the interface structure and the electric contact.
