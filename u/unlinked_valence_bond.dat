50|$|Modern <b>valence</b> <b>bond</b> theory now {{complements}} {{molecular orbital}} theory, {{which does not}} adhere to the <b>valence</b> <b>bond</b> idea that electron pairs are localized between two specific atoms in a molecule but that they are distributed in sets of molecular orbitals which can extend over the entire molecule. Molecular orbital theory can predict magnetic and ionization properties in a straightforward manner, while <b>valence</b> <b>bond</b> theory gives similar results but is more complicated. Modern <b>valence</b> <b>bond</b> theory views aromatic properties of molecules as due to spin coupling of the π orbitals. This is essentially still the old idea of resonance between Kekulé and Dewar structures. In contrast, molecular orbital theory views aromaticity as delocalization of the π-electrons. <b>Valence</b> <b>bond</b> treatments are restricted to relatively small molecules, {{largely due to the}} lack of orthogonality between <b>valence</b> <b>bond</b> orbitals and between <b>valence</b> <b>bond</b> structures, while molecular orbitals are orthogonal. On the other hand, <b>valence</b> <b>bond</b> theory provides a much more accurate picture of the reorganization of electronic charge that takes place when bonds are broken and formed during the course of a chemical reaction. In particular, <b>valence</b> <b>bond</b> theory correctly predicts the dissociation of homonuclear diatomic molecules into separate atoms, while simple molecular orbital theory predicts dissociation into a mixture of atoms and ions. For example, the molecular orbital function for dihydrogen is an equal mixture of the covalent and ionic <b>valence</b> <b>bond</b> structures and so predicts incorrectly that the molecule would dissociate into an equal mixture of hydrogen atoms and hydrogen positive and negative ions.|$|R
50|$|According to {{this theory}} a {{covalent}} bond is formed {{between the two}} atoms by the overlap of half filled valence atomic orbitals of each atom containing one unpaired electron. A <b>valence</b> <b>bond</b> structure {{is similar to a}} Lewis structure, but where a single Lewis structure cannot be written, several <b>valence</b> <b>bond</b> structures are used. Each of these VB structures represents a specific Lewis structure. This combination of <b>valence</b> <b>bond</b> structures is the main point of resonance theory. <b>Valence</b> <b>bond</b> theory considers that the overlapping atomic orbitals of the participating atoms form a chemical bond. Because of the overlapping, it is most probable that electrons should be in the <b>bond</b> region. <b>Valence</b> <b>bond</b> theory views bonds as weakly coupled orbitals (small overlap). <b>Valence</b> <b>bond</b> theory is typically easier to employ in ground state molecules. The inner-shell orbitals and electrons remain essentially unchanged during the formation of bonds.|$|R

The range of <b>valence</b> <b>bonds</b> within this linear combination {{as well as the}} correlations between them can reveal the nature of the singlet state, and are key ingredients in variational calculations. In this work, we study the bipartite <b>valence</b> <b>bond</b> distributions and their correlations within the ground state of the Heisenberg antiferromagnet on bipartite lattices. In terms of field theory, this problem can be mapped to correlation functions near a boundary. In dimension d >= 2, a non-linear sigma model analysis reveals that at long distances the probability distribution P(r) of <b>valence</b> <b>bond</b> lengths decays as |r|^(-d- 1) and that <b>valence</b> <b>bonds</b> are uncorrelated. By a bosonization analysis, we also obtain P(r) proportional to |r|^(-d- 1) in d= 1 despite the different mechanism.
