5000|$|C-squares {{provides}} a hierarchical nomenclature for dividing 10°x10° World Meteorological Organization (WMO) squares into smaller units (each an individual [...] "c-square") of 5°x5°, 1°x1°, 0.5°x0.5°, 0.1°x0.1°, etc., using an alternating base 2, base 5 linear division, {{as fine as}} may be required. Each cell of the resulting subdivision is allocated a <b>unique</b> <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>identifier</b> (c-squares code), such that the position of an object or objects {{on the surface of}} the Globe can be represented by a set of one or more such codes that define the cell(s) within which the object occurs. Storing these codes as text identifiers, for example in a database, repository of spatial metadata, searchable text file or web page, then offers the functionality for a simple, text-based spatial search, without the requirement for any more complex geographic information system (GIS). Once stored (or if desired, generated on-the-fly using a c-squares encoder), a code or set of codes can also be rendered on a map by a utility (for example, the web-accessible c-squares mapper) that incorporates the relevant decoding routines.|$|E
40|$|The USPC is {{a system}} for {{organizing}} all U. S. patent documents and many other technical documents into relatively small collections based on common subject matter. Each subject matter division in the USPC includes a major component called a class and a minor component called a subclass. A class generally delineates one technology from another. Subclasses delineate processes, structural features, and functional features {{of the subject matter}} encompassed within the scope of a class. Every class has a <b>unique</b> <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>identifier,</b> as do most subclasses. A class/subclass pair of identifiers uniquely identifies a subclass within a class (for example, the identifier ― 2 / 456 ‖ represents Class 2, Apparel, subclass 456, Body cover). This unique identifier is called a classification symbol, or simply a classification, or USPC classification, to distinguish it from classifications of other patent classification schemes. A subclass represents the smallest division of subject matter in the USPC under which documents may be collected. A collection of documents is defined as a set of documents sharing a common classification. A classification assigned to a document associates the document to th...|$|E

40|$|The Advanced Groupware Access Protocol, (AGAP) {{allows a}} client to access and store {{electronic}} mail messages, contacts, events, files, and configurations on a server. The electronic mail messages can be grouped in folders. AGAP also provides the capability for an offline client to resynchronize with the server. AGAP does not specify {{a means of}} posting electronic mail messages; this function is handled by a mail transfer protocol such as SMTP [RFC 2821]. It also does not specify a means for exchanging messages with contacts that are reported as being online; this function is handled by an instant messaging protocol such as XMPP [RFC 3921]. AGAP includes the following operations for electronic mail messages: creating, deleting, renaming, moving and coping mail folders; checking for new messages; permanently removing messages; moving and coping messages between folders; fetching information about a message; setting and clearing tags for messages; searching in messages; retrieving {{only a part of}} a message; marking messages as SPAM; deleting attachments from a message. AGAP includes the following operations to manipulate the contacts: creating, deleting, moving, coping, tagging, and searching contacts; checking if a contact is online; fetching information about a contact. AGAP includes the following operations related {{to the use of the}} events: creating, deleting, moving, coping and tagging events in calendar; fetching events details; searching for events. All entries are read and written in format XML encoded UTF- 8 [RFC 3629] and each entry is identified by a <b>unique</b> <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>identifier.</b> AGAP is designed to support access only to a single server per connection. It is also designed to balance the volume of text exchanged between the server and clients and its readability by humans for debugging.

40|$|Detecting {{and documenting}} the {{occurrence}} of invasive species outside their native range requires tools to support their identification. This can be challenging for taxa with diverse life stages and/or problematic or unresolved morphological taxonomies. DNA barcoding provides a potent method for identifying invasive species, as it allows for species identification at all life stages, including fragmentary remains. It also provides an efficient interim taxonomic framework for quantifying cryptic genetic diversity by parsing barcode sequences into discontinuous haplogroup clusters (typical of reproductively isolated species) and labelling them with <b>unique</b> <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>identifiers.</b> Snakehead fishes are {{a diverse group of}} opportunistic predators endemic to Asia and Africa that may potentially pose significant threats as aquatic invasive species. At least three snakehead species (Channa argus, C. maculata, and C. marulius) are thought to have entered North America through the aquarium and live-food fish markets, and have established populations, yet their origins remain unclear. The objectives of this study were to assemble a library of DNA barcode sequences derived from expert identified reference specimens {{in order to determine the}} identity and aid invasion pathway analysis of the non-indigenous species found in North America using DNA barcodes. Sequences were obtained from 121 tissue samples representing 25 species and combined with public records from GenBank for a total of 36 putative species, which then partitioned into 49 discrete haplogroups. Multiple divergent clusters were observed within C. gachua, C. marulius, C. punctata and C. striata suggestin...|$|R
40|$|Since the 1993 {{court case}} of Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. the {{subjective}} nature of toolmark comparison {{has been questioned}} by attorneys and law enforcement agencies alike. This {{has led to an}} increased drive to establish objective comparison techniques with known error rates, much like those that DNA analysis is able to provide. This push has created research in which the 3 -D surface profile of two different marks are characterized and the marks 2 ̆ 7 cross-sections are run through a comparative statistical algorithm to acquire a value that is intended to indicate the likelihood of a match between the marks. The aforementioned algorithm has been developed and extensively tested through comparison of evenly striated marks made by screwdrivers. However, this algorithm has yet to be applied to quasi-striated marks such as those made by the shear edge of slip-joint pliers. The results of this algorithm 2 ̆ 7 s application to the surface of copper wire will be presented. Objective mark comparison also extends to comparison of toolmarks made by firearms. In an effort to create objective comparisons, microstamping of firing pins and breech faces has been introduced. This process involves placing <b>unique</b> <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>identifiers</b> surrounded by a radial code on the surface of firing pins, which transfer to the cartridge 2 ̆ 7 s primer upon firing. Three different guns equipped with microstamped firing pins were used to fire 3000 cartridges.
