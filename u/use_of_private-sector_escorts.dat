40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} the influence of location on the extent <b>of</b> <b>use</b> and impact <b>of</b> external advice and collaboration on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Britain. The analysis indicates that for private-sector advisers (accountants, consultants, etc.) and collaboration with suppliers and customers, the intensity <b>of</b> <b>use</b> does not vary significantly with location in most cases. Only the input of business friends and relatives is strongly locationally constrained, indicating the importance of personal trust processes operating in a different way from other influences. EU Structural Fund status of an area also has few major effects on <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>private-sector</b> advice. However, the impact of external advice and the extent of local collaboration between similar firms are influenced by location, with impact generally increasing with the size of business concentration, density and closeness to a business centre; i. e. there are positive effects of urban location and agglomeration economies. For public-sector support agencies (such as the Small Business Service Business Link, TECs/LECs, enterprise agencies and also chambers of commerce) the reverse is generally true. Levels <b>of</b> <b>use</b> are locationally influenced, but impact is not. Use tends to increase in EU-assisted areas, and in areas with lower levels of business concentration. This applies to most local agents, but for regional development agencies there is an additionally strong effect of highest focus <b>of</b> <b>use</b> and impact in the most rural and peripheral areas. Thus public agents appear generally to be most used and have greatest relevance to SMEs in more peripheral areas where they fill gaps in the market created by agglomeration effects...|$|R
40|$|We {{hypothesize that}} {{recent changes in}} policy {{and the spread of}} in-store medical clinics favor the {{provision}} of medication therapy management (MTM) services by large chain pharmacies while creating the potential for con-flicts of interest from employed prescribers. First, MTM is now required by Medicare Part D, but the program may be more practical for community pharmacy chains than independent pharmacies. Second, in-store clinics have proliferated, which may accommodate the provision of MTM services in these community locations. Third, while physician ownership of pharmacies is restricted, the law has not anticipated the in-store clinic situations in which the pharmacy employs a prescriber on-site. MTM Required Under Medicare Part D In an important policy shift, pharmacists can now seek reim-bursement for cognitive clinical consulting services from plans that contract with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to provide Medicare Part D benefits. 1, 2 This change is the outcome of 2 major laws. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA 2003) man-dated that Part D Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs) or Medicare Advantage Plans (MA-PDs) provide MTM services using pharma-cists “or other qualified healthcare providers. ” 3 Earlier, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 included pharmacy and all health professions in the definition of health data transmission, which inspired the formation of a pharmacy coalition to lobby for billing codes for professional services. 4 The billing codes for MTM services were implemented in 2006. CMS monitors the PDPs, but less is known about the details of service delivery to patients in the community. One recently published study in JMCP made <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>private-sector</b> data for 7 years of MTM services, within and without Part D, and suggested that MMA 2003 inspired the type of MTM services to move from education involving acute medications to consultative services for chronic therapy, with attributable cost avoidance. ...|$|R

40|$|Restrictive {{employment}} protection legislation has been highlighted {{as a key}} reason for lower labor productivity in Europe compared to the United States. Evidence in the literature has shown robust effects of {{employment protection}} on effort, though the effects appear too small to generate marked cross-country differences in labor productivity. The authors revisit this issue <b>using</b> representative data <b>of</b> <b>private-sector</b> workers in Spain. A range of legislative changes aimed at reducing the incidence of temporary employment are used to estimate the effect of permanent employment on one aspect of effort, absenteeism. Results suggest that being employed on a permanent contract increases the probability of being absent from work due to sickness by approximately 5. 3 percentage points and the time absent by approximately 0. 30 of a day per week.

With respect to the effect <b>of</b> participation in <b>private-sector</b> training on subsequent employ-ment prospects, we find a positive effect in both samples as the probability of being employed in subsequent years is raised by about 2 – 3 percentage points. However, this positive employment effect disappears after around 5 years...|$|R

FAS 106 requires companies to record retiree health benefit liabilities on their financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. With the new view of the cost, and the increasing cost of providing retiree health benefits in general, many private-sector employers began to overhaul their retiree health benefit programs in ways that controlled, reduced, or eliminated their costs. Today, the public sector faces similar accounting standards and similar cost pressures. • State and Local Governments: The percentage of local governments offering retiree health benefits has declined, while the percentage of state governments offering it has increased...|$|R

40|$|Public-private {{partnership}} (PPP) {{models for}} public infrastructure delivery are becoming popular among government institutions around the world, {{due to their}} embedded potential value for money (VFM) {{to the public and}} governments themselves. The experience with infrastructure PPPs internationally have demonstrated many problems and partnership failures, where both {{the public and private sectors}} suffered huge losses. Motivated by a number of these failures, this study investigates the actions and decisions <b>of</b> <b>private-sector</b> partners by evaluating 35 failed transportation PPPs around the world. This paper identifies a set of drivers responsible for the failures of transportation PPPs, discusses the causal relationships between them, and finally evaluates a set of failure mechanisms initiated by the private-sector partners. It sheds light on the role <b>of</b> <b>private-sector</b> partners in terms of triggering failure mechanisms in transportation PPP failures. The identification of failure mechanisms discloses the fact that inappropriate decisions and actions <b>of</b> <b>private-sector</b> partners (i. e.,failure drivers) have created problems for other project partners, which ultimately caused the PPP failures. The failure mechanism model suggested here provides insight into the existing failure trends associated with private-sector partners in transportation PPPs. These findings will help private-sector partners to safeguard partnerships more effectively and provide public-sector PPP practitioners with a better understanding of their partners' actions and decisions and their influence on project success...|$|R

The project looks at the criminal, civil and administrative measures against this twin of bribery of public officials.
