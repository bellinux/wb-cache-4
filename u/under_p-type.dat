40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a P-type iterative learning control (ILC) scheme with initial state learning {{for a class}} of α(0 ≤α< 1) fractional-order nonlinear systems. By introducing the λ-norm and using a generalized Gronwall inequality, the sufficient condition for the robust convergence of the tracking errors with respect to initial positioning errors <b>under</b> <b>P-type</b> ILC is obtained. Based on this convergence condition, the learning gain of the initial learning and input learning updating law can be determined. Unlike the existing methods, the ILC scheme will not fix the initial value on the expected condition {{at the beginning of}} each iteration. Finally, the validity of the methods are verified by a numerical example...|$|E
40|$|We {{implement}} metallic {{layers of}} Si-doped (110) GaAs as modulation doping in high mobility p-type heterostructures, changing to p-growth {{conditions for the}} doping layer alone. The strongly auto-compensated doping is first characterized in bulk samples, identifying the metal-insulator transition density and confirming classic hopping conduction in the insulating regime. To overcome the poor morphology inherent to Si p-type (110) growth, heterostructures are fabricated with only the modulation doping layer grown <b>under</b> <b>p-type</b> conditions. Such heterostructures show a hole mobility of 1. 75 x 10 ^ 2 cm^ 2 /Vs at density p= 2. 4 x 10 ^ 11 cm^- 2. We identify the zero field spin-splitting characteristic of p-type heterostructures, but observe a remarkably isotropic mobility and a persistent photoconductivity unusual for p-heterojunctions grown using other doping techniques. This new modulated growth technique is particularly relevant for p-type cleaved-edge overgrowth and for III-V growth chambers where Si is the only dopant. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure...|$|E
40|$|Isotopically {{controlled}} silicon multilayer {{structures were}} {{used to measure the}} enhancement of self- and dopant diffusion in extrinsic boron doped silicon. {sup 30 }Si was used as a tracer through a multilayer structure of alternating natural Si and enriched {sup 28 }Si layers. Low energy, high resolution secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) allowed for simultaneous measurement of self- and dopant diffusion profiles of samples annealed at temperatures between 850 C and 1100 C. A specially designed ion- implanted amorphous Si surface layer was used as a dopant source to suppress excess defects in the multilayer structure, thereby eliminating transient enhanced diffusion (TED) behavior. Self- and dopant diffusion coefficients, diffusion mechanisms, and native defect charge states were determined from computer-aided modeling, based on differential equations describing the diffusion processes. We present a quantitative description of B diffusion enhanced self-diffusion in silicon and conclude that the diffusion of both B and Si is mainly mediated by neutral and singly positively charged self-interstitials <b>under</b> <b>p-type</b> doping. No significant contribution of vacancies to either B or Si diffusion is observed...|$|E

50|$|The P-type ATPases, {{also known}} as E1-E2 ATPases, are {{a large group of}} {{evolutionarily}} related ion and lipid pumps that are found in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. <b>P-type</b> ATPases fall <b>under</b> the <b>P-type</b> ATPase (P-ATPase) Superfamily (TC# 3.A.3) which, as of early 2016, includes 20 different protein families. P-type ATPases are α-helical bundle primary transporters named based upon their ability to catalyze auto- (or self-) phosphorylation of a key conserved aspartate residue within the pump and their energy source, adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In addition, they all appear to interconvert between at least two different conformations, denoted by E1 and E2.|$|R

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the energetic properties of Mn-doped MgO bulk and (100) surfaces using a QM/MM embedding computational method, calculating the formation energy for doped systems, {{as well as for}} surface defects, and the subsequent effect on chemical reactivity. Low-concentration Mn doping is endothermic for isovalent species in the bulk but exothermic for higher oxidation states <b>under</b> <b>p-type</b> conditions, and compensated by electrons going to the Fermi level rather than cation vacancies. The highest occupied dopant Mn 3 d states are positioned in the MgO band gap, about 4. 2 eV below the vacuum level. Surface Mn-doping is more favourable than subsurface doping, and marginally exothermic on a (100) surface at high O 2 pressures. For both types of isovalent Mn-doped (100) surfaces, the formation energy for catalytically important oxygen defects is less than for pristine MgO, with F 0 and F 2 +-centres favoured in n- and p-type conditions, respectively. In addition, F+-centres are stabilised by favourable exchange coupling between the Mn 3 d states and the vacancy-localised electrons, as verified through calculation of the vertical ionisation potential. The adsorption of CO 2 on to the pristine and defective (100) surface is used as a probe of chemical reactivity, with isovalent subsurface Mn dopants mildly affecting reactivity, whereas isovalent surface-positioned Mn strongly alters the chemical interactions between the substrate and adsorbate. The differing chemical reactivity, when compared to pristine MgO, justifies further detailed investigations for more varied oxidation states and dopant species...|$|E
40|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{diffusion of}} Si and the dopants B, P, and As {{has been studied}} {{by the use of}} a multilayer structure of isotopically enriched Si. This structure, consisting of 5 pairs of 120 nm thick natural Si and {sup 28 }Si enriched layers, enables the observation of {sup 30 }Si self-diffusion from the natural layers into the {sup 28 }Si enriched layers, as well as dopant diffusion from an implanted source in an amorphous Si cap layer, via Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS). The dopant diffusion created regions of the multilayer structure that were extrinsic at the diffusion temperatures. In these regions, the Fermi level shift due to the extrinsic condition altered the concentration and charge state of the native defects involved in the diffusion process, which affected the dopant and self-diffusion. The simultaneously recorded diffusion profiles enabled the modeling of the coupled dopant and self-diffusion. From the modeling of the simultaneous diffusion, the dopant diffusion mechanisms, the native defect charge states, and the self- and dopant diffusion coefficients can be determined. This information is necessary to enhance the physical modeling of dopant diffusion in Si. It is of particular interest to the modeling of future electronic Si devices, where the nanometer-scale features have created the need for precise physical models of atomic diffusion in Si. The modeling of the experimental profiles of simultaneous diffusion of B and Si <b>under</b> <b>p-type</b> extrinsic conditions revealed that both species are mediated by neutral and singly, positively charged Si self-interstitials. The diffusion of As and Si under extrinsic n-type conditions yielded a model consisting of the interstitialcy and vacancy mechanisms of diffusion via singly negatively charged self-interstitials and neutral vacancies. The simultaneous diffusion of P and Si has been modeled on the basis of neutral and singly negatively charged self-interstitials and neutral and singly positively charged P species. Additionally, the temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient of Si in Ge was measured over the temperature range of 550 C to 900 C using a buried Si layer in an epitaxially grown Ge layer...|$|E

GQDs of 4. 5 +/- 0. 55 nm average diameter are synthesised via an electrochemical approach using multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as precursor. After treatment in hydrazine vapour for 24 h, the field effect measurements yield hole mobility of 0. 01 cm(2) V(- 1) s(- 1) and I-on/I-off ratio of about 45.

Our calculated results predict that the interstitial B is the most stable defect <b>under</b> N-rich and <b>p-type</b> conditions. While the B vacancy and interstitial N become the dominate defects when the electron chemical potential is near the conduction band maximum of host. Nevertheless, these compensating defects would be inactive due to their ultra deep ionization levels under both p- and n-type conditions. Comment: 6 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
40|$|International audienceScanning probe {{microscopy}} (SPM) characterizations {{were performed}} on nonintentionally doped n-type ZnO nanopillars (NPs) embedded in a polymer matrix. Transport properties investigations using scanning capacitance microscopy revealed local p-type space charge regions spreading over the outer shell of the polymer-coated ZnO NP. Correlatively, different electrical behaviors were found for the core and shell parts of the NPs using scanning spreading resistance microscopy. From SPM imaging at various voltage biases and local I-V curves, an electrical transport analysis was carried out based on surface states arising from the surrounding environment. Surface barrier potential inducing ptype conductivity in polymer-coated ZnO NPs was discussed and estimated to amount to several hundreds of millielectron- volt. As a further consequence a critical diameter <b>under</b> which full <b>p-type</b> conductivity occurs in the NPs was demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally...|$|R
40|$|Pristine, single-crystalline {{graphene}} {{displays a}} unique collection of remarkable electronic properties {{that arise from}} its two-dimensional, honeycomb structure. Using in situ low-energy electron microscopy, we show that when deposited on the (111) surface of Au carbon forms such a structure. The resulting monolayer, epitaxial film is formed by the coalescence of dendritic graphene islands that nucleate at a high density. Over 95 % of these islands can be identically aligned with {{respect to each other}} and to the Au substrate. Remarkably, the dominant island orientation is not the better lattice-matched 30 ° rotated orientation but instead one in which the graphene [01] and Au [011] in-plane directions are parallel. The epitaxial graphene film is only weakly coupled to the Au surface, which maintains its reconstruction <b>under</b> the slightly <b>p-type</b> doped graphene. The linear electronic dispersion characteristic of free-standing graphene is retained regardless of orientation. That a weakly interacting, non-lattice matched substrate is able to lock graphene into a particular orientation is surprising. This ability, however, makes Au(111) a promising substrate for the growth of single crystalline graphene films...|$|R
40|$|Photodiodes made {{of small}} {{molecular}} weight organic semiconductors have been fabricated. The organic materials <b>under</b> investigation are <b>p-type</b> Copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) and n-type 3, 4, 9, 10 -perylenetetracarboxylic bisbenzimidazole (PTCBI). Current-voltage and capacitance-voltage measurements {{have been performed}} to evaluate the electrical properties of the organic photodiodes. Optical measurements including responsivity and temporal response have also been carried out. It {{has been found that}} device efficiency of the photodiodes is influenced by the thickness of organic layers as well as the device structures. It is believed that organic layer thickness is a strong function of materials' exciton diffusion lengths. The thickness of the organic layer employed in the fabricated photodiode is 100 A or less. However, the fabricated devices with thin organic layer showed poor performance in terms of saturation current and breakdown voltage. As a result, new device structures have been proposed to overcome the problems. Stacking structure double heterojunction (SDH) and novel comb-like structure single heterojunction (CSH) device configurations have shown a substantial improvement in both electrical and optical parameters. There is at least 3 times enhancement in photocurrent and 10 times increase in external quantum efficiency for photodiodes employing CSH device structure and 100 A organic layer. Improvements in saturation current and breakdown voltage have also been observed. In addition, responsivity measurements in CSH devices have yielded a 7 times improvement. Furthermore, the carrier lifetime of the photodiode is estimated to be around 1 microsecond from the temporal response measurements. The combined effect of thin organic layers and new device structures leads to an overall improvement in device performance...|$|R
40|$|By {{employing}} first-principle total-energy calculations, {{a systematic}} {{study of the}} dopability of ZnS to be both n- and p-types {{compared with that of}} ZnO is carried out. We find that all the attempted acceptor dopants, group V substituting on the S lattice site and group I and IB on the Zn sites in ZnS, have lower ionization energies than the corresponding ones in ZnO. This can be accounted for by the fact that ZnS has relative higher valence band maximum than ZnO. Native ZnS is weak <b>p-type</b> <b>under</b> S-rich condition, as the abundant acceptor V-Zn has rather large ionization energy. Self-compensations by the formation of interstitial donors in group I and IB-doped p-type ZnS can be avoided when sample is prepared under S-rich condition. In terms of ionization energies, Li-Zn and N-S are the preferred acceptors in ZnS. Native n- type doping of ZnS is limited by the spontaneous formation of intrinsic V-Zn(2 -); high efficient n-type doping with dopants is harder to achieve than in ZnO because of the readiness of forming native compensating centers and higher ionization energy of donors in ZnS.

40|$|In-vivo {{dosimetry}} with diode detectors {{is used in}} {{radiation therapy}} as a quality assurance tool. The diode sensitivity under radiation depends upon temperature, dose rate and SDD (source-to-detector distance), field size, beam angle, and energy. This dissertation presents the first systematic and quantitative study of dosimetric characteristics {{for most of the}} commercial radiation diodes (n-type and <b>p-type)</b> <b>under</b> different radiation beams. In the temperature dependence study, the systematic study on the dose rate dependence of svwt (sensitivity variation with temperature) was performed. It was concluded that sufficient preirradiation can eliminate dose rate dependence of svwt. However, preirradiation cannot eliminate dose rate dependence of the diode sensitivity, S, itself. In the dose rate and SDD dependence study, it was shown that the p-type diodes do not always show less dose rate dependence than the n-type diodes. Preirradiation does not always reduce diode dose rate dependence. SDD dependence of diode sensitivity {{can be explained by the}} instantaneous dose rate dependence if sufficient buildup is provided to eliminate electron contamination. An empirical formula was proposed to fit the dose rate dependence of diode sensitivity. In the energy dependence study, the energy dependence diode detectors are quantified. The empirical theory to quantify this effect was developed. Monte Carlo simulation and the cavity theory are used to predict the energy dependence. It was concluded that the energy dependence does not depend on whether the diode is n- or p- type but rather depends mainly on the material around the die (buildup and its geometry). A systematic study of the correction factors for accurate diode dosimetry is presented in this dissertation. This dissertation has established a theoretical foundation for the modeling of the transient electric and radiation properties of the diode detectors, separately. We believe that the Monte Carlo simulations code for radiation transport should be coupled with the continuity equations to describe the charge transport in the diode detector, and thus provides a complete quantitative description of dosimetric characteristics of the diode detectors. The ultimate goal is to use the diode detector as an absolute dosimeter, rather than as a relative dosimeter...|$|R
40|$|For the {{fabrication}} of ULSI circuits, the silicon surface {{should be free}} of metallic and particulate contamination and be atomically smooth. Heavy metal contaminants have {{detrimental effects on the}} yield of microelectronic processing and reliability of solid state devices by increasing the junction leakage current, degrading the integrity of gate oxide and reducing the oxide breakdown voltage. It has been demonstrated that the contamination level for most metals has to be controlled below 10 ¹⁰ atoms/cm² for sub-quarter micron processing. Some transition and noble metal ions such as copper, silver and gold are known to deposit on silicon surfaces in acidic fluoride based solutions. Among them, copper {{has been the focus of}} most research due to the widespread use of copper in microelectronic industry. To investigate the mechanisms by which copper deposits on silicon surfaces in HF and BHF solutions, different electrochemical techniques were used, including dc polarization and ac impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results of electrochemical measurements, in conjunction with various surface characterization techniques, such as TXRF, AFM and TEM, reveal the rates of reactions that occur at silicon/solution interface can be affected by many factors, such as silicon dopant type and doping levels, ionic strength of electrolytes, illumination conditions and the use of additives. For example, under darkness, the amount of copper deposition is nearly one order of magnitude less than that <b>under</b> illumination for <b>p-type</b> silicon in both HF and BHF solutions and n-type silicon in HF solutions. In BHF solutions, n-type silicon is very close to its flat band condition where illumination plays little role. The addition of copper ions in BHF solutions not only causes metal contamination, but also generates severe surface roughness due to the masking effect of copper on the anisotropic etching of silicon in BHF solutions. Local etching rate of 1 nm/min was measured on the silicon sample prepared in 100 ppb Cu²⁻ BHF solutions. Some additives such as surfactants and hydrochloric acid can effectively reduce the reaction rates of silicon corrosion and copper deposition by either blocking the active reaction sites or form copper ion complexes...|$|R
