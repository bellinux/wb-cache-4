We find that subjects do not truncate <b>their</b> <b>preferences</b> more often when truncation is profitable. They do, however, truncate <b>their</b> <b>preferences</b> less often when truncation is dangerous – that is, when there is a risk of “over-truncating” and remaining unmatched.

30|$|In this {{preference}} study, {{we found}} that, given a choice, {{the majority of}} women would prefer to undergo office hysteroscopy for further investigation of the uterine cavity. This conclusion may be even stronger with the knowledge that the women participating in this study experienced more pain during office hysteroscopy compared to SIS [9]. In other words, pain scores had no effect on <b>their</b> <b>preferences</b> afterwards. In women preferring SIS for uterine cavity assessment, the most important factor for <b>their</b> <b>preference</b> seems to be pain, while in women preferring hysteroscopy, other factors (e.g. immediate therapy) seemed to be of more importance in <b>their</b> <b>preference.</b>|$|R
30|$|In {{relation}} to transformational leadership, no significant relationship is found between power distance orientation and preference for transformational leadership (β[*]=[*]−[*] 0.09, n.s.). As {{to the relationship}} between followers’ CSE and <b>their</b> <b>preferences</b> for four leadership styles, except that followers’ CSE has no significant relationship with <b>their</b> <b>preference</b> for moral leadership (β[*]=[*] 0.08, n.s.), positive relationships are found between followers’ CSE and <b>their</b> <b>preference</b> for authoritarian leadership (β[*]=[*] 0.14, p[*]<[*] 0.01), benevolent leadership (β[*]=[*] 0.23, p[*]<[*] 0. 01) and transformational leadership (β[*]=[*] 0.28, p[*]<[*] 0.01).

40|$|In a multi-agent context where a set {{of agents}} {{declares}} <b>their</b> <b>preferences</b> over {{a common set of}} candidates, it is often the case that such agents interact and exchange opinions before voting. In this initial phase, agents may influence each other and therefore modify <b>their</b> <b>preferences,</b> until hopefully they reach a stable state. Recent work has modelled the influence phenomenon in the case of voting over a single issue. Here we generalize this model to account for preferences over combinatorially structured domains including several issues. When agents express <b>their</b> <b>preferences</b> as CP-nets, we show how to model influence functions and to aggregate preferences by possibly interleaving voting and influence convergence. ...|$|R

To meet this end, a questionnaire was distributed among 147 Iranian EFL learners to choose <b>their</b> <b>preferences</b> for corrective feedback provider. The data gathered was then submitted to SPSS software, and was analyzed using a Chi-Square test. The results have {{indicated that there was}} a statistically significant relationship between learners’ age and gender and <b>their</b> <b>preferences</b> for corrective feedback provider. However, no statistically significant relationship was found between learners’ proficiency level and <b>their</b> <b>preferences</b> for corrective feedback provider. The results demonstrated that female students prefer to be corrected by their teachers only, while males tended to receive corrective feedback from both their teachers and classmates. Moreover the results indicated that teens and young adults were more eager to be corrected by the teacher, whereas adults preferred to be corrected by both their teachers and their classmates...|$|R

With the revised preference, the interactive methods search for new preferred solutions, which usually needs less computational cost compared with the a posteriori methods. In the existing interactive methods, only one single preference model is adopted, such as reference vectors [88, 89, 90, 91], weights [92, 93, 94, 95], preference relation [96, 97, 98], and utility functions [99].|$|R
