40|$|EMBA Project ReportEXECUTIVE SUMMARY: The {{project was}} {{designed}} to provide {{an assessment of the}} best practices used in payroll management by a variety of Navy commands. The project aimed to benchmark the average cost of payroll execution processing at the various Navy commands to determine if Navy Installation Command (NIC) is expending resources effectively. A secondary analysis determined institutional cost-effectiveness and cost-benefits of payroll tracking, reporting, and reconciliation practices with a goal of improving the accuracy of financial reporting. This report provides an assessment of data collected on the best practices and related costs of similar functions performed at a selection of Navy commands. A variety of cost ratios are provided to determine if other Navy commands are providing similar services more effectively and efficiently. The scope of the project was limited to assessment and comparison of US direct hire civilians and related hours consumed by each command to produce a variety of monthly and annual reports that are required from each command, regardless of the echelon or reporting hierarchy of the command. Effectiveness ratings are based on command opinions of the systems used in the production of the monthly and annual reports. The team recognizes the ratings are subjective and is unable to validate the responses. Results of the analysis indicate internally-developed systems are preferred over Navy-provided systems by commands. Internally-developed systems provide better management flexibility and easier report generation than Navy-provided systems. Internally-developed systems are least cost efficient although more effective in areas of reporting and tracking costs. The number of <b>unit</b> <b>identification</b> <b>codes</b> (UICs) managed by a command is a main cost driver in the cost of providing the service. Fewer UICs require less tracking and reporting regardless of the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) reported in each UIC. The team recommends the client coordinate with Military Sealift Command (MSC) to review their processes and reporting. MSC is the most cost efficient of the participants and reports the highest effectiveness through a combined use of Work Years Personnel Costs (WYPC) and Financial Management System (FMS), an internally developed system...|$|R

For understanding, the derivation and the description of the <b>identification</b> <b>codes</b> for the entire conventional and advanced measurement systems classifying the function, and the equipment unit, key, as adopted in the conventional power plants, have been included. Amendments have also been made to the appendices. In particular, the list of measurement systems covering the measurement <b>identification</b> <b>code,</b> instrument, measured quantity, measuring range, band width, uncertainty and sensor location has been updated and extended to include the supplementary instrumentation. Beyond these amendments, the uncertainties of measurements have been precisely specified. The measurement <b>identification</b> <b>codes</b> which also stand for the identification of the corresponding measured quantities in engineering <b>units</b> and the <b>identification</b> <b>codes</b> derived therefrom for the computed parameters have been adequately detailed.

40|$|The {{description}} {{relates to}} a measuring probe comprising a receiver unit, which receives a high frequency field radiated by a transmitter and evaluation unit located at a distance, {{a power supply}} unit, which generates a supply voltage for the measuring probe from the high frequency output signal of the receiver unit, a sensor unit, whose sensor signal is converted into a signal by a voltage-generated oscillator, {{the frequency of the}} converted signal being proportional to the output signal, and a modulation unit which modulates the high frequency output signal of the receiver unit with the output signal of the oscillator and applies the modulated signal to a transmitter unit. The invention is characterized by the sensor unit having at least one reference element and/or a further sensor and an <b>identification</b> <b>unit</b> generating an <b>identification</b> <b>code,</b> whose output signals are applied multiplexed by a multiplexer to the voltage-controlled oscillator, by means of which the high frequency carrie r signal can be modulated via the oscillator...|$|R

Today, the band {{has been reduced to}} volunteer status but officially maintains an establishment of eight paid military musicians on its rolls. The band has had mixed success in competitions, but under the direction of Pipe Major Michael Giles had become successful in the Grade Three circuit in Alberta in the years leading up to the regimental centennial in 2010. The band published a recording to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Regiment in 1990, titled Eighty Years of Glory and commemorated its centennial in 2010 by releasing a second CD entitled Onward.|$|E
