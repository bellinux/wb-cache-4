5000|$|In 1939, the United States {{purchased}} 1,200 tons {{of uranium}} ore from the Union Minière du Haut Katanga's Shinkolobwe {{mine in the}} Belgian Congo, that was warehoused on Staten Island, New York City. [...] The Canadian municipality of Port Hope, Ontario was site of the former radium producer and, at that time, sole North American <b>uranium</b> <b>refiner,</b> Eldorado Mining and Refining Limited, which between 1941 and 1946 provided {{a steady supply of}} <b>refined</b> <b>uranium</b> oxide to the Manhattan Project. [...] In 1942, the Canadian government acquired Eldorado, making it a crown corporation in 1944. [...] Eldorado's initial supplies were derived from uranium concentrates at Port Hope that had accumulated as tailings from its past radium operations, and, beginning in 1942, refined from newly mined ore shipped from its re-opened Great Bear Lake pitchblende mine in the Northwest Territories. [...] Eldorado in addition refined at Port Hope the US's Congolese ore stockpile that had been shipped from the New York storage facility, and further shipments of ore from the Congo. [...] The 1,100 tons of Canadian-mined uranium, and 3,700 tons from the Congo that were refined in Canada, along with 1,200 tons from Colorado, comprised the six thousand tons of uranium oxide that formed the Manhattan Project's raw materials for the fissionable cores of the uranium-235 and plutonium-239 atomic bombs that were released and exploded over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan in August 1945, immediately killing an estimated thirty percent of Hiroshima's civilian and military population, and resulting in an estimated total of 293,000 fatalities in the two cities, from both the immediate blast and long-term radiation exposure.|$|R
40|$|During the pyroprocessing of spent {{nuclear fuel}} by {{electrochemical}} techniques, fission products are separated as the fuel is oxidized at the anode and <b>refined</b> <b>uranium</b> is deposited at the cathode. Those fission products that are oxidized into the molten salt electrolyte are considered active metals while {{those that do not}} react are considered noble metals. The primary noble metals encountered during pyroprocessing are molybdenum, zirconium, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, and technetium. Pyroprocessing of spent fuel to date has involved two distinctly different electrorefiner designs, in particular the anode to cathode configuration. For one electrorefiner, the anode and cathode collector are horizontally displaced such that uranium is transported across the electrolyte medium. As expected, the noble metal removal from the <b>uranium</b> during <b>refining</b> is very high, typically in excess of 99 %. For the other electrorefiner, the anode and cathode collector are vertically collocated to maximize uranium throughput. This arrangement results in significantly less noble metals removal from the <b>uranium</b> during <b>refining,</b> typically no better than 20 %. In addition to electrorefiner design, operating parameters can also influence the retention of noble metals, albeit at the cost of uranium recovery. Experiments performed to date have shown that as much as 100 % of the noble metals can be retained by the cladding hulls while affecting the uranium recovery by only 6 %. However, it is likely that commercial pyroprocessing of spent fuel will require the uranium recovery to be much closer to 100 %. The above mentioned design and operational issues will likely be driven by the effects of noble metal contamination on fuel fabrication and performance. These effects will be presented in terms of thermal properties (expansion, conductivity, and fusion) and radioactivity considerations. Ultimately, the incorporation of minor amounts of noble metals from pyroprocessing into fast reactor metallic fuel will be shown to be of no consequence to reactor performance...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Some {{attempts}} were made to remove and recover uranium that may be present in nuclear fuel effluents and mine tailings using microorganisms isolated from North American uranium deposits. To establish which microorganisms accumulate the most uranium, hundreds strains of microorganisms were screened. Of these strains of microorganisms tested, extremely high uranium accumulating ability was found in some bacteria isolated from North American uranium deposits. These bacterial strains, such as Arthrobacter and Bacillus sp., can accumulate about 2500 µmol uranium per gram dry wt. of microbial cells within one hour. These microbial cells can remove uranium from the <b>uranium</b> <b>refining</b> waste water with high efficiency. These microbial cells can also accumulate thorium as well as uranium with high efficiency. The microbial cells immobilized with polyacrylamide gel have excellent handling characteristics and can be used repeatedly in the adsorption-desorption cycles.
