25|$|At about 12:15 am, a flare lit <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> and {{the first}} armored {{personnel}} vehicle appeared on the Square from the west. At 12:30 am, two more APCs arrived from the South. The students threw chunks of cement at the vehicles. One APC stalled, perhaps by metal poles jammed into its wheels, and the demonstrators covered it with gasoline-doused blankets {{and set it on}} fire. The intense heat forced out the three occupants, who were swarmed by demonstrators. The APCs had reportedly run over tents and many in the crowd wanted to beat the soldiers. But students formed a protective cordon and escorted the three men to the medic station by the History Museum {{on the east side of}} the Square.|$|E
25|$|On {{a mission}} to rescue half-bloods Bianca and Nico di Angelo; Percy, Annabeth, Thalia and Grover are {{attacked}} by a manticore and rescued by the goddess Artemis and her Hunters. However, Annabeth falls off a cliff whilst trying to fight the manticore and {{is said to be}} captured. Later, Artemis is captured by Luke's army while on the hunt for the Ophiotaurus, a cow-serpent monster that was foretold to bring the downfall of Olympus when its entrails are sacrificed to a fire. Her lieutenant Zoe Nightshade, daughter of Atlas, leads Bianca, Thalia and Grover on a quest to save her. Percy, who was not invited to join the party, follows them on behalf of Nico Di Angelo, promising that he will do his best to protect his sister, Bianca. The others eventually find Percy, and he joins their group. They become the prey of skeletons, who chase them across the country. Bianca is able to kill one, which leaves the others mystified. Bianca later dies as they make their way across a godly junkyard. They find Annabeth with Luke and Artemis, who is holding <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b> Percy then takes it from Artemis and they trick Atlas into his original position under the sky. Thalia replaces Zoe, who dies, as Artemis' lieutenant. Thalia's induction as a lieutenant of Artemis ensures that she will become immortal, never aging to 16, thus escaping the Great Prophecy and leaving Percy to fulfill it. They return to camp and Percy informs Nico about Bianca's death during the journey. Nico blames Percy for failing to protect her and runs away, only after killing skeletons that invade the camp, so that Percy realizes that Hades is Nico's father.|$|E

500|$|Hypostyle halls, covered rooms {{filled with}} columns, appear in temples {{throughout}} Egyptian history. By the New Kingdom they typically lay {{directly in front}} of the sanctuary area. These halls were less restricted than the inner rooms, being open to laymen at least in some cases. They were often less dark as well: New Kingdom halls rose into tall central passages over the processional path, allowing a clerestory to provide dim light. The epitome of this style is the Great Hypostyle Hall at Karnak, whose largest columns are [...] tall. In later periods, the Egyptians favored a different style of hall, where a low screen wall at the front let in the light. The shadowy halls, whose columns were often shaped to imitate plants such as lotus or papyrus, were symbolic of the mythological marsh that surrounded the primeval mound at the time of creation. The columns could also be equated with the pillars that held <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> in Egyptian cosmology.|$|E
500|$|... "Gridlock" [...] is {{the third}} in a trilogy which began with series one's [...] "The End of the World" [...] and series two's [...] "New Earth". Novice Hame and the green {{crescent}} seen on the mood patches previously appeared in [...] "New Earth". Head writer and executive producer Russell T Davies wanted to visit the same world each year to maintain a sense of continuity, {{something that could be}} hard to do with Doctor Who formula. Producer Phil Collinson remarked that [...] "Gridlock" [...] displayed Davies' tendency to write about [...] "topical" [...] issues; it is set in a dark dystopian future, but is also a satire on the common traffic jam. While the story is bleak, Davies showed how the Doctor transforms the place by literally opening <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> and bringing in light. Davies also used hymns to signify hope and a togetherness {{of the members of the}} Motorway. Those on the Motorway sing [...] "The Old Rugged Cross", and the hymn heard at the end of the episode is [...] "Abide with Me". The episode also displays the Doctor's growing attachment to Martha; he feels guilty for lying to her and bringing her to New New York just to show off and realises that he misses her when she is taken.|$|E

After a final {{encounter}} with Dr. Thorn in which Percy pleads with Mr. D to help him defeat the manticore, Grover heads back to Camp Half-Blood with the ophiotaurus. Zoë, Percy, and Thalia go to find Frederick Chase {{in the hope that}} he will help them reach their final destination: Mount Tamalpais, which is the modern location of the Titans' fortress on Mount Othrys. With Mr. Chase's car, they travel to the Garden of Hesperides. Zoë is wounded by the dragon Ladon while they pass through. From the place where Atlas once held <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> they see Artemis now doing his job. Seeing Annabeth tied up and held hostage by Luke and learning that [...] "the General" [...] is Zoë's father, the Titan Atlas, Percy takes the sky from Artemis so she can fight the Titan's advance guard. Artemis engages Atlas and is able to trap him under the sky again, but not before he seriously wounds Zoë by pushing her off of a cliff. Thalia battles Luke, and he falls from a cliff, apparently dead. With the help of Mr. Chase, who arrives in a biplane he has fitted with machine guns with Celestial bronze bullets, they escape and travel to a nearby airfield in Artemis' silver chariot. Zoë dies shortly after landing and Artemis makes a constellation in her honor. The rest of the group then heads for Olympus.|$|E

500|$|Singapore, then a British colony, {{had been}} conferred city status by a royal charter from King George VI in 1951. In 1958, the City Council of Singapore {{approached}} Zubir {{to compose a}} song {{for the city to}} be titled [...] "Majulah Singapura", which was a motto to be displayed in the Victoria Theatre after its renovation. Zubir's song, [...] "Majulah Singapura" [...] ("Onward Singapore"), was first performed by the Singapore Chamber Ensemble during the grand finale of a concert staged in the Victoria Theatre on 6 September 1958 to celebrate its official reopening. When Singapore attained self-government in 1959, the Government felt that a national anthem was needed to unite the different races in Singapore. It decided that the City Council's song, which was already popular, would serve this purpose. After some revisions were made to the song, it was adopted by the Legislative Assembly on 11 November 1959, and on 30 November the Singapore State Arms and Flag and National Anthem Ordinance 1959 was passed. This statute regulated the use and display of the State Arms and State Flag and the performance of the National Anthem. [...] "Majulah Singapura" [...] was presented to the nation on 3 December at the launch of [...] "Loyalty Week", replacing the colonial anthem [...] "God Save the Queen". After Singapore's full independence from Malaysia on 9 August 1965, [...] "Majulah Singapura" [...] was formally adopted as the Republic's national anthem. In a 1984 oral history interview, to sum up his philosophy when composing the anthem, Zubir cited the Malay proverb [...] "Di mana bumi dipijak, di situ langit dijunjung" [...] ("You should hold <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> of the land where you live").|$|E
