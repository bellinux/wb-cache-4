5|$|The worst mining {{disaster}} in the town occurred at Yew Tree Colliery on 11 December 1858 when an explosion of firedamp caused by a safety lamp cost 25 lives, the youngest victim was 11, and the oldest, 35 years of age. Some of the victims are buried in the churchyard at St George's Church. Another explosion on 6 March 1877 at Great Boys Colliery cost eight lives and on 2 October 1883, six men died when the cage rope broke at Nelson Colliery in Shakerley. On 1 October 1895 five men including the colliery manager and <b>undermanager</b> died at Shakerley Colliery after an explosion of firedamp.|$|E

5000|$|In 1908 the {{colliery}} {{had five}} shafts and employed 400 workers underground and 150 above ground. The colliery was managed by Peter Gorton, and his <b>undermanagers</b> were T Pownall, John Grundy and P Bullough. George Orwell visited the colliery in 1936 {{when he was}} gathering material for his book The Road to Wigan Pier. [...] Today the colliery site is a privately owned and consists of agricultural land, housing and a water ski lake, to the north east of the Three Sisters Recreation Area.|$|R
40|$|An {{enduring}} {{feature of}} new public management (NPM) {{in many countries}} has been the move to create more autonomous, ?complete? organisations such as universities, hospitals and social service agencies. Often referred to as ?corporatisation?, this process {{is assumed to be}} leading to the emergence of new organisational forms with dedicated management functions and a greater focus on strategy. However, these assumptions remain largely untested and rely heavily on ?technical? accounts of organisational restructuring, ignoring the potential influence of institutional pressures and internal political dynamics. In this paper, we address this concern focusing on the case of acute care public hospitals that have undergone corporatisation (to become Foundation Trusts) in the English National Health Service. Using administrative data spanning six years (2007 - 2012), the analysis shows that corporatisation is having mixed effects. While it is associated with a shift in the focus of managers to strategic concerns, it has not led to an expansion of management functions overall. Both tendencies are found to be mediated by institutional pressures, in the form of media scrutiny, and, indirectly, by the involvement of clinical professions in management. These results advance ongoing debates about the emergence of new organisational forms in the public sector, highlighting the limitations of technical accounts of change and raising the possibility that corporatisation is leading to organisations that are both more managed and <b>undermanagered</b> at the same time...|$|R
50|$|Much of {{the success}} of the {{recovery}} can be directly attributed to Edward Brownfield Wain, who had been appointed <b>Undermanager</b> in 1882. He soon introduced the more productive longwall working of the coalfaces in place of the more traditional ‘pillar and stall’ system. He was appointed Colliery Manager in 1886 and by 1890 the Company was once more paying its way. In the same year the liquidators came to an understanding with the North of England Trustee, Debenture and Assets Corporation Limited of Manchester, who agreed to purchase the old Chatterley Iron Company.|$|E

5000|$|Peckfield Colliery {{was owned}} by Messrs. Joseph Cliff and Sons, with Mr. Joseph Cliff being senior partner of the Micklefield Coal and Lime Company. Mr. Charles Houfton had been the manager since the {{colliery}} opened, and Mr. William Radford had been employed as the Under Manager for 17 years. [...] Despite seven fatal accidents in nineteen years, Peckfield was considered by miners to be a safe mine. [...] Ventilation was drawn through the seams by a Waddle fan {{at the top of}} the Upcast shaft, and had removed the eleven instances of small escapes of gas since 1891. [...] Men worked with picks by the light of tallow candles, whilst the <b>undermanager</b> and five deputies carried safety lamps.|$|E
40|$|This {{method has}} been applied to the {{analysis}} of a spontaneous combustion event for the five year mine plan of the new Abel Mine, Newcastle, Australia. A team of people with diverse backgrounds provided input to the analysis, which was facilitated by a risk management consultant. The team consisted of the Technical Services Manager – Underground Operations, the Project Manager, The <b>Undermanager,</b> the Ventilation Officer, the local Check Inspector (representing the underground operators), a ventilation consultant and a coal spontaneous combustion expert. The resulting fault tree has provided the mine with a clear set of controls that can be incorporated into a spontaneous combustion management plan. This approach sets a new benchmark for the coal industry and produces a generic model that is robust enough to be transferable to any mine by adjustment of the site specific parameters. Some of the branches of the fault tree will be presented in this paper to raise the awareness of the coal industry to the comprehensive nature of this approach to risk management...|$|E
