40|$|Heart valves {{demonstrate}} a characteristic stress-strain curve {{with a low}} slope portion, in which collagen fibers <b>uncrimp,</b> and a high slope region, in which the uncrimped collagen fibers bear load. The acuteness of the transition between these two regions depends upon collagen fiber alignment. We assessed the radius of transition curvature (RoTC) {{as an indicator of}} differences in collagen fiber alignment of porcine aortic and mitral valves (AV, MV, n= 46 hearts) with age (6 weeks, 6 months, 6 years) in both the radial and circumferential directions. The RoTC of radial strips was 3 - 5 times greater than that of circumferential strips. Radially, RoTC was greater in the AV than in MV. Circumferentially, RoTC was lowest {{in the center of the}} MV anterior leaflet (MVAC), followed by AV, and then the free edge of the MV anterior leaflet. RoTC decreased with age, particularly in AV radial strips, likely due to age-related increases in collagen alignment and crosslinking. These findings are consistent with circumferentially oriented collagen fibers within valves, especially the high collagen fiber alignment in the MVAC. In conclusion, RoTC is an easily calculated parameter that may be useful in characterizing the orientation of fibers and the matrix composition of biological materials...|$|E
40|$|Collagen fiber re-alignment and {{uncrimping}} are postulated {{mechanisms of}} structural response to load. It {{has been suggested}} that fibers re-orient in the direction of load and then 2 ̆ 2 <b>uncrimp</b> 2 ̆ 2 before collagen is tensioned and that in general, the structure {{is a result of the}} function tendons perform. However, little is known about how fiber re-alignment and uncrimping change in response to load, how this change relates to tendon mechanical properties, and if these changes are dependent on the underlying structure. Throughout postnatal development, dramatic structural and compositional changes occur in tendon. Postnatal tendons, with immature collagen networks, may respond to load in a different manner and timescale than mature collagen networks. Therefore, the overall objective of this study was to quantify the mechanical properties and structural response to load in a developmental mouse tendon model at 4, 10, 28 and 90 days old. Local collagen fiber re-alignment and crimp frequency were quantified throughout mechanical testing and local mechanical properties were measured. Throughout development, fiber re-alignment occurred at different points in the mechanical testing protocol. At early development, re-alignment was not identified until the linear (4 days) or toe-regions (10 days) of the mechanical test suggesting that fibers required a prolonged exposure to mechanical load before responding and that the immature collagen network present may delay re-alignment. The uncrimping of collagen fibers was identified during the toe-region of the mechanical test at all ages suggesting that crimp contributes to tendon nonlinear behavior. Additionally, results at 28 and 90 days suggested that collagen fiber crimp frequency decreased with increasing number of preconditioning cycles, which may affect toe-region properties. Mechanical properties and cross-sectional area increased throughout development. The insertion site demonstrated lower moduli values and a more disorganized fiber distribution compared to the midsubstance at all ages suggesting it experiences multi-axial loads. Further, the tendon locations demonstrated different re-alignment and crimp behaviors suggesting that locations may respond to load differently and develop at different rates. Results from this study suggest that structure affects the tendon 2 ̆ 7 s ability to respond to load and that the loading protocol applied may affect the measurement of mechanical properties. ...|$|E

The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of the blood flow velocity (due to 4 or 6 mm ID) and the structure of inner graft surface (crimped, <b>uncrimped)</b> on the endothelialization. AMVC were harvested from omental adipose tissue (mean: 0. 56 X 10 (6) cells/g tissue) from 10 mongrel dogs (mean: 27. 9 kg). During preclotting, the 4 mm <b>uncrimped</b> and the 6 mm crimped double velour Dacron prostheses (Meadox Medicals, Inc.) were seeded with 1. 0 X 10 (6) cells/cm 2 graft surface.

40|$|This work explores a {{strategy}} for generating functional, three-dimensional (3 D) microstructures using (i) photolithography to fabricate micron-scale features, and (ii) self-assembly by spontane-ous folding to generate the 3 D structure. The strategy has two parts. In the first, we pattern a flexible, polymer tape with metal features and dip-coat these features with solder. On crimping this tape into a quasi- 3 D shape and joining it to a second flat tape, the structure becomes a linear, quasi- 3 D structure. In the second part, this structure is allowed to self-assemble into more complex 3 D structure by folding; this folding is driven by capillary interactions between the drops of solder. By attaching electronic elements to the <b>uncrimped</b> tape, we demonstrate the generation of an electrically functional device: a self-assembled millimeter-scale 360 -degree light detector.

40|$|The optical {{characteristics}} of the human cornea depends on the mechanical balance between the intra-ocular pressure and intrinsic tissue stiffness. A wide range of ophthalmic surgical procedures alter corneal biomechanics to induce local or global curvature changes for the correction of visual acuity.

40|$|Background Transcatheter {{aortic valve}} {{replacement}} {{has emerged as}} a promising therapy for treatment of severe aortic stenosis. Although {{it has been shown that}} these valves can be safely delivered and implanted, studies of valve longevity are lacking because of the infancy of the technology. Particularly, the effects of stent crimping on the valve's leaflets have not yet been sufficiently investigated. In this study, we have characterized the effects of crimping on pericardial leaflets in time and through the depth of the tissue. Methods To test the structural changes at the surface and deep layers of bovine pericardial leaflets, scanning electron microscopy and second-harmonic generation microscopy were used. An <b>uncrimped</b> tissue sample was imaged, followed by imaging a segment of tissue after crimping in a stented transcatheter valve, immediately after, at 20 minutes, and 60 minutes after crimping. The crimping experiment was performed for multiple crimping sizes (ie, 14 F, 16 F, and 18 F). We defined a damage index that quantifies the level of leaflet structural changes as a result of crimping. Results Based on the calculated damage indices and analyses of the raw images, it was determined that crimping does measurable damage to the leaflet tissue that persists with time. Conclusions Significant tissue damage was observed at the surface layers of the leaflets. In the deeper tissue layers, damage was substantial for 14 F crimping; however, it became less significant but still visible for larger collapse profiles. Crimping may induce substantial structural damage to pericardial leaflets that does not improve with time. © 2014 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons...|$|R
40|$|Ligament {{viscoelasticity}} is {{an important}} determinant of tissue response to loading, and viscous dissipation modulates the potential for ligament damage or catastrophic failure. The nature of ligament viscoelastic response represents a combined measure of solid phase viscoelasticity and fluid movement. Both of these contributors are likely direction-dependent due to ligament anisotropy. Small sinusoidal perturbations about an equilibrium strain value allow application of linear viscoelasticity theory for determination of dynamic stiffness (a measure of modulus) and phase angle (a measure of energy dissipation). The objective {{of this study was}} to quantify the multiaxial strain- and rate-dependent viscoelastic behavior of the human medial collateral ligament (MCL) in tension along its longitudinal and transverse directions, and under simple shear loading. It was hypothesized that the dynamic stiffness would increase modestly with strain rate and strain level and that the phase would remain constant with frequency but decrease with increasing strain level. Results demonstrated that dynamic stiffness of human MCL varies greatly with test mode and equilibrium strain, but the magnitude is relatively insensitive to strain rate. The phase lag had very similar magnitudes and variation with frequency across all three test configurations. The only exception was a higher phase lag at low frequencies for the longitudinal tests. This could be due to an energy dissipation contribution by <b>uncrimped</b> collagen at the lowest strain level. The increase in phase at higher frequencies indicates increased energy dissipation and may provide a protectiveiii mechanism under fast loading. The data obtained in this investigation will help to develop three dimensional constitutive models of the human MCL. i...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: For years, civil {{engineers}} {{have been in}} search for alternatives to steels and alloys to combat {{the high costs of}} repair and maintenance of structures damaged by corrosion and heavy use. In recent years there has been a marked increase in the use of fiber reinforced polymers (FRP) as structural elements in bridge construction. This is attributed to the advantageous properties of these materials, such as high strength to weight ratio, possibility of producing any shape, their high resistance to corrosion and fatigue, and easy maintenance. The current study utilizes the advancements in the three dimensional weaving technology in developing an innovative FRP deck system that satisfy AASHTO HS- 20 performance specifications. This paper presents fiber reinforced polymeric bridge decks that utilize an innovative textile engineering 3 -D weaving technology to overcome the weaknesses of its predecessors. The produced panels encompassed continuity of reinforcing fibers in both the top and bottom skins as well as between the outer skin and the inner core. The primary in-plane fiber reinforcement is <b>uncrimped</b> due to the orientation of the weaving. The 3 -D fibers perform as through thickness reinforcement, provide additional resistance to crack propagation and eliminate delamination as a failure mode. The feasibility and implications of using the 3 -D weaving process for FRP bridge decks is demonstrated by testing three woven glass FRP bridge deck slabs under static loading conditions. Test results exemplified the importance of the structural attachment of the core components to the outer composite deck skins and demonstrated resistance of delamination of the core to the outer skins and within the skins...|$|R
30|$|Though {{this study}} {{demonstrated}} alteration of tendon mechanics in injected tendons at 4 % strain, it remains unknown whether similar alteration {{would be seen}} in vivo or to what significance this type of alteration may have on likelihood of re-injuries or rupture, which obviously must be considered when determining timing for return to activity or sport. Another {{limitation of this study}} {{is the fact that the}} effect of intratendinous injections and fenestration on mechanical properties of the tendon was only tested to a maximum of 4 % strain. In normal movement and activity, tendons typically experience strains of less than 4 %, predominantly due to <b>uncrimping</b> of the collagen fibers until reaching roughly 2 % strain and then due to actual stretch of the collagen fibers as strains increase beyond that (Kelc Robi et al. 2013). When a tendon is strained beyond 4 %, microfailure of individual fibrils begins to occur and macrofailure (e.g., rupture) of the tendon typically occurs when it is stretched to greater than 8 - 10 % its original length (Kelc Robi et al. 2013; Woo et al. 2000). In porcine tendons, irreversible damage generally occurs at or above 6.5 % strain (Duenwald-Kuehl et al. 2012). Thus, while our study suggests that intratendinous injections have the potential to alter tendon mechanics at strains on the upper limit of those produced with normal activity, further research is necessary to investigate whether tendon mechanics are also altered at higher levels of strain and whether or not the point of rupture is affected following these treatments. Similarly, further research is necessary to determine whether or not the observed alteration of mechanics is reproducible in an in vivo model and whether the addition of PRP to the injectant results in alterations different than those seen with saline injections. Our results suggest early tendon loading at low strain is likely acceptable, but it may be prudent to exercise caution and avoidance of high strain loading of tendons treated with intratendinous injection in the immediate period following injection. It is not known how long the mechanical effects observed in this study may persist.|$|R
40|$|Tendons {{are able}} to {{withstand}} {{the broad range of}} stresses and strains via their finely tuned composition and structure. In addition, tendons undergo a coordinated set of dynamic responses, specifically collagen <b>uncrimping,</b> re-alignment, sliding and deformation, within the matrix. To date, a complete understanding of the hierarchical structure-function relationships in tendon is lacking. Therefore, the overall goal of this thesis was to measure tendon structure and function in a mouse supraspinatus model of altered structure, and to analyze links between mechanical properties, dynamic processes and composition/structure using a series of statistical analyses. In the studies presented here, we used novel and established methods to measure the multi-scale composition, structure and mechanical function of mouse supraspinatus tendons from wild type, collagen V heterozygous and collagen V null mice. Overall, we found that the experimental groups were mechanically inferior to the wild type group, with larger changes in both macroscale function and the dynamic responses (re-alignment, crimp, deformation, sliding). In addition, while fibril morphology was altered at both locations, the insertion site also exhibited alterations in cell and fiber morphology as well as extracellular matrix composition. Finally, using a novel regression approach, we found that the contribution of composition and structure as well as the contribution of dynamic processes to determining macroscale mechanical function was highly dependent on location and that the dynamic processes were significant mediators of the relationship between composition/structure and mechanical properties. Overall, we conclude that although collagen V is a quantitatively minor component in mature tendon/ligament, it is a major regulator of composition and structure during development which ultimately leads to mechanical function. Furthermore, we conclude that the dynamic responses to load are crucial factors in ultimately determining regionally-dependent mechanical function. This information will help to guide clinicians in developing preventative techniques and appropriate rehabilitation strategies, as well as help to define the appropriate and important parameters on which to base tissue engineering efforts for tendon augmentation or replacement. Finally, this work presents a strong foundation on which to develop future experimental and modeling efforts in order to fully understand the complex structure-function relationships present in tendon. ...|$|R
