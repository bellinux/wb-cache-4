5|$|After the metre was redefined in 1960, the {{kilogram}} {{remained the}} only SI base <b>unit</b> <b>that</b> {{relied on a}} specific physical artefact, the international prototype of the kilogram (IPK), for its definition and thus the only <b>unit</b> <b>that</b> was still subject to periodic comparisons of national standard kilograms with the IPK. After the 1996–1998 recalibration, a clear divergence between the various prototype kilograms was observed.|$|E

30|$|Our {{method is}} {{inspired}} by the potential outcomes framework [31], and in particular by propensity score matching [32]. A typical way to assess causality is to assign some treatment {{to a set of}} randomly chosen units, and then compare the effects on <b>units</b> <b>that</b> received treatment vs. <b>units</b> <b>that</b> did not receive it. This does not work in observational studies in which units decide if they want to undergo treatment. The basic idea of propensity score matching is to compare <b>units</b> <b>that</b> are very similar except for their choice to receive treatment. Our method compares <b>units</b> <b>that</b> are identical, except for the “treatment” variable.|$|R

5|$|Crystals of widgiemoolthalite {{conform to}} a monoclinic system of symmetry, occupying space group P21/c. A unit cell of the mineral, the {{smallest}} divisible <b>unit</b> <b>that</b> possesses the same symmetry and properties, {{is composed of}} two of its molecules and has the dimensions a = 10.06, b = 8.75, and c = 8.32Å. Each unit cell of widgiemoolthalite has a β value of 114.3° and a volume of 667.48Å3.|$|E

5|$|It {{was decided}} to hold the games in Perth because the city was to host the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games and Royal Perth Hospital had a well {{developed}} spinal <b>unit</b> <b>that</b> could support paraplegic athletes. The Commonwealth Paraplegic Games were held before the main Games as to not impact on this event and provide the opportunity for athletes to stay on for the main Games.|$|E
50|$|As of 5/3/17. <b>Units</b> <b>that</b> have {{received}} a full engine overhaul meet Tier 1+ emission standards, while <b>units</b> <b>that</b> have not yet received a full engine overhaul meet Tier 0+ emission standards. While all of the rebuilds are being upgraded to 4,500 traction horsepower, the Tier 0+ units generally only make 4,300-4,400 horsepower. Those <b>units</b> <b>that</b> have been overhauled and meet Tier 1+ emission standards are 7233, 7235, 7243, 7250, 7253, 7258, 7293, 7296, 7298, 7305, 7308, and 7319.|$|R
50|$|The {{situation}} {{today is}} <b>that</b> the currency <b>units</b> <b>that</b> {{are used in}} Israel, Jordan, Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, and the Yemen are all descended from the pound sterling unit, while the currency <b>units</b> <b>that</b> are used in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates are all descended from the Maria Theresa Thaler. This largely explains the factor of ten difference in value on average between Bahrain, Kuwait and Oman on the one hand, and Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates on the other hand. Bahrain, Kuwait and Oman are using <b>units</b> <b>that</b> are descended from sterling, whereas Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates are using <b>units</b> <b>that</b> are descended from the Maria Theresa Thaler.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{adopts a}} spatial probit {{approach}} to explain interaction effects among cross-sectional units when {{the dependent variable}} {{takes the form of}} a binary response variable and transitions from state 0 to 1 occur at different moments in time. The model has two spatially lagged variables: one for <b>units</b> <b>that</b> are still in state 0 and one for <b>units</b> <b>that</b> had already transferred to state 1. The parameters are estimated on observations for those <b>units</b> <b>that</b> are still in state 0 at the start of the different time periods, whereas observations on units after they transferred to state 1 are discarded, just as in the literature on duration modeling. Furthermore, neighboring <b>units</b> <b>that</b> had not yet transferred may have a different impact from <b>units</b> <b>that</b> had already transferred. We illustrate our approach with an empirical study of the adoption of inflation targeting for a sample of 58 countries over the period 1985 - 2008. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
5|$|Kulintang {{music has}} no set {{compositions}} {{due to its}} concept of rhythmic modes. A rhythmic mode (or designation or genre or pattern) {{is defined as a}} musical <b>unit</b> <b>that</b> binds together the entire five instrument ensemble. By adding together the various rhythms of each instrument, one could create music and by changing one of the rhythms, one could create different music. This is the basis of the rhythmic mode.|$|E

5|$|The first Corps {{was a small}} <b>unit</b> <b>that</b> {{served in}} the Caribbean from 1808 to 12 October 1810, {{recruited}} from former slaves to address the shortage of military manpower in the Caribbean.

The Corps followed {{the practice of the}} British Army's West India Regiments in recruiting slaves as soldiers.|$|E

5|$|The unit is {{responsible}} for providing command and control to subordinate Engineer units. The unit was formerly designated as the 36th Engineer Group, and before that as the 36th Engineer Regiment.

5|$|Unit {{prices have}} been readjusted and some units renamed, {{as well as new}} ones introduced. New land units include the Bike, a highly mobile {{infantry}} <b>unit</b> <b>that</b> can capture properties; the Flare, an armored vehicle <b>unit</b> <b>that</b> can reveal areas affected by the Fog of War; the Anti-Tank, an indirect-fire unit strong against tanks with the ability to counter-attack during direct attacks; and the War Tank (formerly the Mega Tank), the strongest ground unit in the game. New air units include the Duster, a weaker, lower-cost interceptor that can strike ground units; and the Seaplane, which is produced by Carriers and can attack any unit, but has limited ammo and fuel reserves. Additionally, there is a single new sea unit, the Gunboat, which is armed with a missile salvo that must be resupplied after each use, and can transport one infantry/mech unit. Also, the Battleship was given the ability to move and fire in the same turn, making it the only indirect-combat unit able to do so.|$|E

Unit experience is not persistent, and the player begins each mission with new units.|$|E
