The steady state and transient experiments, which will be performed under the joint program, are to be as prototypic of fast reactor performance as is possible. The specific objectives of this document are: (1) dictate the activities and responsibilities for the HEDL Transient Test Program; (2) specify the technical requirements for the CO 4, CO 5, CO 6 and CO 7 test train (SPTTs); and (3) specify the technical requirement for the CO 6 and CO 7 Single Pin Test Loops (SPTLs).

40|$|The {{applicability}} for inherent shutdown {{mechanisms in}} accelerator-driven systems (ADS) has been investigated. We study {{the role of}} reactivity feedbacks. The benefits, in terms of dynamics performance, for enhancing the Doppler effect are examined. Given the performance character-istics of source-driven systems, {{it is necessary to}} manage the neutron source in order to achieve inherent shutdown. The shutdown system must be capable of halting the external source before excessive temperatures are obtained. We evaluate methods, based on the analysis of <b>unprotected</b> <b>accidents,</b> to accomplish such means. Pre-concepted designs for self-actuated shutdown of the external source suggested. We investigate time responses and evaluate methods to improve the performance of the safety system. It is shown that maximum beam output must be limited by fundamental means in order to protect against accident initiators that appear to be achievable in source driven systems.

40|$|Executive Summary: The goal of {{this project}} is to develop the {{conceptual}} designs of fast flexible conversion ratio reactors using lead and liquid salt coolants and to compare the results with a gascooled fast reactor developed in an MIT NERI project and a sodium-cooled reactor under development at ANL. To maintain {{the scope of the}} study manageable within the 2 -year time frame and funding constraints, core designs that fit in the same reactor plant were executed for two limiting conversion ratios: (1) near zero, to transmute legacy waste and (2) near unity, to operate in a sustainable closed cycle. To reap the benefits of economy of scale, a large power rating of 2400 MWt was set as the target thermal power for both reactor designs. In addition, the achievement of inherent reactor shutdown in <b>unprotected</b> <b>accidents</b> (without scram) was set as a desirable goal. Project DE-FC 07 - 06 ID 14733 United States.

This paper presents the main results of the safety analysis for beyond design basis conditions, namely design extension conditions (DEC), which include the failure of prevention and mitigation systems, like the reactor scram in the so-called unprotected transients. The main objective of this analysis is to evaluate {{the impact of the}} core and plant design features on the intrinsic safety behaviour of the ALFRED reactor. Several computer codes: SIM-LFR, RELAP 5, CATHARE, SPECTRA and TRACE are applied to evaluate the consequences of representative <b>unprotected</b> <b>accident</b> scenarios such as Loss-of-Flow, Loss-of-Heat-Sink and Reactivity initiated accidents. Additionally, the consequences of steam generator tube rupture and partial sub-assembly flow blockage events are assessed by means of appropriate fluid-dynamic codes. JRC.

40|$|Conceptual {{designs of}} lead-cooled and liquid salt-cooled fast {{flexible}} conversion ratio reactors were developed. Both concepts have cores reated at 2400 MWt {{placed in a}} large-pool-type vessel with dual-free level, which also contains four intermediate heat exchanges coupling a primary coolant to a compact and efficient supercritical CO 2 Brayton cycle power conversion system. Decay heat is removed passively using an enhanced Reactor Vessel Auxiliary Cooling System and a Passive Secondary Auxiliary Cooling System. The most important findings were that (1) it is feasible to design the lead-cooled and salt-cooled reactor with the flexible conversion ratio (CR) {{in the range of}} CR= 0 and CR= 1 n a manner that achieves inherent reactor shutdown in <b>unprotected</b> <b>accidents,</b> (2) the salt-cooled reactor requires Lithium thermal Expansion Modules to overcme the inherent salt coolant's large positive coolant temperature reactivity coefficient, (3) the preferable salt for fast spectrum high power density cores is NaCl-Kcl-MgCl 2 as opposed to fluoride salts due to its better themal-hydraulic and neutronic characteristics, and (4) both reactor, but attain power density 3 times smaller than that of the sodium-cooled reactor...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{designed}} and analyzed advanced sodium-cooled fast reactor cores using uranium-free metallic fuels for maximizing burning rate of transuranics (TRU) nuclides from PWR spent fuels. It {{is well known}} that the removal of fertile nuclides such as 238 U from fuels in liquid metal cooled fast reactor leads to the degradation of important safety parameters such as the Doppler coefficient, coolant void worth, and delayed neutron fraction. To resolve the degradation of the Doppler coefficient, we considered adding resonant nuclides to the uranium-free metallic fuels. The analysis results showed that the cores using uranium-free fuels loaded with tungsten instead of uranium have a significantly lower burnup reactivity swing and more negative Doppler coefficients than the core using uranium-free fuels without resonant nuclides. In addition, we considered the use of axially central B 4 C absorber region and moderator rods to further improve safety parameters such as sodium void worth, burnup reactivity swing, and the Doppler coefficient. The results of the analysis showed that the final design core can consume ~ 353 kg per cycle and satisfies self-controllability under <b>unprotected</b> <b>accidents.</b> The fuel cycle analysis showed that the PWR–SFR coupling fuel cycle option drastically reduces the amount of waste going to repository and the SFR burner can consume the amount of TRUs discharged from 3. 72 PWRs generating the same electricity...|$|R
