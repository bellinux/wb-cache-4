5|$|In 1944, Republic Aviation's chief designer, Alexander Kartveli, {{began working}} on a turbojet-powered {{replacement}} for the P-47 Thunderbolt piston-engined fighter. The initial attempts to redesign the P-47 to accommodate a jet engine proved futile due to the large cross-section of the early centrifugal compressor turbojets. Instead, Kartveli and his team designed a new aircraft with a streamlined fuselage largely occupied by an axial compressor turbojet engine and fuel stored in rather thick <b>unswept</b> wings.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{withdrawal}} of XXBomber Command, the British Royal Air Force's No. 222 Group assumed responsibility for minelaying operations in the Singapore area using B-24 Liberator bombers. Minelaying ceased on 24 May so that <b>unswept</b> mines did {{not interfere with the}} planned British-led landings in Malaya which were scheduled for September. The Japanese established observation posts on islands in the Singapore Strait to spot minefields, but these were not effective and generally the fields were not detected until a ship struck a mine. In total, air-dropped mines sank three ships near Singapore and damaged another ten. Moreover, the minefields disrupted Japanese convoy routes and efforts to repair ships. The Allied minelaying campaign was too brief to achieve decisive results, however.|$|E
5|$|In September 1946, {{prior to}} the {{completion}} of the DH 108s, BOAC requests necessitated a redesign of the DH 106 from its previous 24-seat configuration to a larger 36-seat version. With no time to develop the technology necessary for a proposed tailless configuration, Bishop opted for a more conventional 20-degree swept-wing design with <b>unswept</b> tail surfaces, married to an enlarged fuselage accommodating 36 passengers in a four-abreast arrangement with a central aisle. Replacing previously specified Halford H.1 Goblin engines, four new, more powerful Rolls-Royce Avons were to be incorporated in pairs buried in the wing roots; Halford H.2 Ghost engines were eventually applied as an interim solution while the Avons cleared certification. The redesigned aircraft was named the DH 106 Comet in December 1947. Revised first orders from BOAC and British South American Airways totalled 14 aircraft with delivery projected for 1952.|$|E
25|$|A rocket-assisted {{version of}} the P.1052, {{designated}} P.1078 and using the Armstrong Siddeley Snarler engine, {{was the subject of}} a design study, but because work on the <b>unswept</b> P.1040-based Hawker P.1072 was more advanced, the P.1078 was not built.|$|E
25|$|Designing Stirling engine heat {{exchangers}} is {{a balance between}} high heat transfer with low viscous pumping losses, and low dead space (<b>unswept</b> internal volume). Engines that operate at high powers and pressures require that {{heat exchangers}} on the hot side be made of alloys that retain considerable strength at high temperatures and that don't corrode or creep.|$|E
25|$|In Dempster–Shafer theory, or {{a linear}} belief {{function}} in particular, a linear regression model may be {{represented as a}} partially swept matrix, which can be combined with similar matrices representing observations and other assumed normal distributions and state equations. The combination of swept or <b>unswept</b> matrices provides an alternative method for estimating linear regression models.|$|E
25|$|Preliminary {{design studies}} for a {{replacement}} for the Morane-Saulnier MS-760 of the Argentine Air Force started at the Fábrica Militar de Aviones (FMA) in 1978, with these studies resulting in selection of a proposal powered by a single Garrett TFE731 turbofan with high, <b>unswept</b> wings. At {{the same time the}} FMA signed a partnership agreement with Dornier to develop the new aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The {{front wing}} was {{moderately}} tapered {{with a straight}} leading edge, while the rear wing was in three parts: an <b>unswept</b> centre section, clearing the propeller and supporting the main undercarriage legs, and outer sections from about ¼ span swept back at approximately 30°, supporting large end-plate fins at the tips. The box-like fuselage connected all the components and carried the engine, fuel and cockpit {{as well as the}} nose undercarriage.|$|E
25|$|The Group arrived off of Barletta on 1 October, at 13:00. They heaved to off {{the harbor}} and were boarded by British Naval Officers in Charge, who {{instructed}} them to proceed to Manfredonia to discharge the cargo. At 14:30, they got underway for Manfredonia staying well inshore to avoid the <b>unswept</b> minefields off the coast. At 17:00 they entered Manfredonia harbor and discharged their tanks. She was the first ship to land tanks on the Adriatic coast.|$|E
25|$|Developed {{from the}} medium-range Tupolev Tu-104, the Tu-124 {{was meant to}} meet Aeroflot's {{requirement}} for a regional airliner to replace the Ilyushin Il-14 on domestic routes. Resembling a 75% scaled-down Tu-104, the two were hard to tell apart at a distance {{but it was not}} a complete copy of the Tu-104. The Tu-124 had a number of refinements, including double-slotted flaps, a large centre-section airbrake and automatic spoilers. Unlike the Tu-104, the wing trailing edge inboard of the undercarriage was <b>unswept.</b>|$|E
25|$|In August 1923, British {{aircraft}} manufacturers {{were invited}} to submit designs to Air Ministry Specification 26/23, which called for a single Rolls Royce Condor-engined two-seat day or night bomber. The Berkeley was Bristol's response, designed largely by W.T. Reid with finishing touches from Bristol's longtime chief designer, Frank Barnwell. It was a fabric-covered all-metal structured three-bay biplane, with equal span, <b>unswept</b> and unstaggered wings with Frise-type ailerons on {{the upper and lower}} planes. Structurally, the wings were of rolled steel and duralumin.|$|E
25|$|The Avro 730 was an <b>unswept</b> canard design, making {{extensive}} use of stainless steel and powered {{by a total of}} four Armstrong Siddeley P.176 turbojet engines. As an aid to development, the Bristol Type 188 aircraft was built to test the compound-delta wing shape, and later, the effects of prolonged supersonic flight on metal. Up to 10 prototypes of the aircraft were proposed, necessitated in part by a decision made part-way through the development process to give the aircraft a bombing capability.|$|E
25|$|The Council of Ministers {{ordered the}} Ilyushin design bureau on 12 February 1946 {{to begin work}} on a bomber that would use four of the new TR-1 jet engines. Experiences with the first {{generation}} of jet fighters had revealed unsuspected problems involved with high-speed flight and Ilyushin devoted much effort to mitigate them. The long, thin <b>unswept</b> wing was conventional in appearance, but it was shaped to improve lateral stability at high angles of attack and to prevent the onset of tip stall.|$|E
25|$|The TB was a {{seaplane}} {{with twin}} fuselages, situated 10ft (3.35m) apart, with the pilot in one fuselage and the observer in the other, having {{no means of}} communication other than hand signals. Each of the twin fuselages was a wooden structure with fabric covering, with a tractor engine {{in front of each}} fuselage. It had fabric-covered, wooden unstaggered, <b>unswept</b> and unequal-span wings. The upper wing extension was wire braced to steel pylons above the wing. The Blackburn had ailerons on the upper wings only.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} has {{an unusual}} configuration with a fully glazed forward cabin, reminiscent of an Alouette helicopter, that provides 270° panoramic vision and almost vertical downward {{vision for the}} pilot and two passengers. The aircraft has twin booms with twin rudders and a high-mounted tailplane. It {{is powered by a}} Lycoming flat-six normally-aspirated engine situated behind the cabin and driving a fixed pitch ducted fan. Due to the ducted fan, the aircraft is exceptionally quiet. The aircraft has a fixed tricycle undercarriage with the nosewheel offset to the left. The wings are <b>unswept</b> and untapered. The aircraft is of fairly standard all-metal construction with stressed skin of aluminium.|$|E
25|$|The {{fuselage}} and empennage have {{a wooden}} structure and carbon fibre skin. The engine is 73.5 kW (98.6 hp) Rotax 912S flat-four, driving a variable pitch propeller. The cabin {{is over the}} wings, with two pairs of side-by-side seats. Entry is by two upward-opening doors {{and there is a}} baggage space behind the rear seats. At the rear the vertical surfaces are straight-edged and swept, with a long dorsal strake. The horizontal surfaces are approximately trapezoidal in plan, with an <b>unswept</b> leading edge.Both the rudder and elevators are fabric covered. The rudder is balanced and both it and the port elevator carry trim tabs.|$|E
25|$|The E-34 was {{a single}} engine biplane, seating two in tandem. It had <b>unswept</b> single bay wings of the same span and {{constant}} chord, with some stagger. The wings were fabric-covered wooden structures. Only the lower wing carried dihedral. The N-shaped interplane struts were assisted by flying wire bracing. The upper wing was supported over the fuselage {{by a pair of}} N-shaped struts to the upper fuselage longerons. The upper centre section had a large cut-out in its trailing edge for better upward visibility, and also contained the fuel tank. Ailerons were fitted only on the lower wing. The HS-34 had its tailplane mounted on top of the fusealge, carrying split elevators. The rudder was horn balanced.|$|E
25|$|Regarding {{the cause}} of the fire, the story goes that before going to bed, a lady of the house threw melted grease from the socket of a large {{candlestick}} into a fire grate in a lower storey {{of the house and the}} ensuing flames set alight the <b>unswept</b> chimney flue, the fire rapidly entering the new mansion wing through windows in the garret that had been left open by workmen. The keys had been taken offsite by carpenters and access to control the fire was impossible. Large numbers of people turned out to help, but their assistance was to no avail. Until the death of the earl in 1781 the cause had been carefully concealed and supernatural forces held to blame.|$|E
25|$|Three initial design {{concepts}} were {{developed for the}} Model 45, including one with the Bonanza's signature V-tail, but the final design that emerged in 1948 incorporated conventional tail control surfaces {{for the benefit of}} the more conservative military (featuring a relatively large <b>unswept</b> vertical fin that would find its way onto the Travel Air twin-engine civil aircraft almost ten years later). The Bonanza's fuselage with four-passenger cabin was replaced with a narrower fuselage incorporating a two-seater tandem cockpit and bubble canopy, which provided greater visibility for the trainee pilot and flight instructor. Structurally, the Model 45 was much stronger than the Bonanza, being designed for +10g and −4.5g, while the Continental E-185 engine of 185 horsepower (hp) at takeoff (less than a third of the power of the T-6's engine) was the same as that fitted to contemporary Bonanzas.|$|E
25|$|The second Type 173 was {{designated}} Type 173 Mk 2 and allocated military serial XH379, {{and had a}} revised landing gear, with castoring front wheels and fixed rear wheels. It was also fitted with small stub wings at {{the front and rear}} to improve the cruise speed, the stub wings being removed after a few flights when the helicopter was used for Naval trials, and an <b>unswept</b> tailplane was added. As a result of the trials the Royal Navy showed an interest in ordering the type for carrier duties. In August 1956 the second prototype was leased to British European Airways for evaluation. The Mk 2 aircraft was destroyed in an accident during an air show at Filton in September 1956. The helicopter crashed into the ground nose first while making the transition from hover to forward flight. The crew escaped unharmed but the aircraft was written off. After the crash the tailplane was salvaged from the Mk 2 and fitted to the Mk 1 to investigate the best configuration for stability.|$|E
500|$|The OKB chose a [...] "pod-and-boom" [...] layout {{for their}} new fighter, the I-300 (also called the izdeliye F (model or product F) by the OKB) because it offered the {{advantages}} of improved landing performance and better visibility from the cockpit when landing but it had some drawbacks, such as the unfamiliar tricycle arrangement of the landing gear, protecting the rear fuselage from the jet exhaust, and where to place the aircraft's armament. The all-metal aircraft had <b>unswept,</b> mid-mounted wings with two prominent air intakes in the nose. Its two-spar wings were fitted with slotted flaps and Frise ailerons. Its powerplant comprised two RD-20 turbojets, which were Soviet-manufactured versions of the BMW 003. The two engines were located behind the cockpit in the lower fuselage, with the exhaust exiting under the tail unit. A steel laminate heatshield was installed {{on the bottom of}} the rear fuselage to protect it from the exhaust gasses. There were four bag-type fuel tanks in the fuselage and three in each wing, providing a total internal fuel capacity of 1,625 liters (429 US gallons). The cockpit was not pressurized. The planned armament consisted of a 57mm NL-57 cannon mounted in the centerline engine intake bulkhead and two 23mm Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 autocannon mounted on the lower lip of the air intakes. The N-57 gun was provided with 28 rounds and the two NS-23 cannons had 80 rounds each.|$|E
2500|$|The Bodmin [...] {{was a large}} three bay biplane with <b>unswept</b> and unstaggered square tipped {{wings of}} equal span and {{constant}} chord. [...] These had leading-edge-balanced ailerons on both upper and lower planes and the rather rectangular fin and tailplane carried similarly balanced control surfaces. [...] The rudder extended below the fuselage underside.|$|E
2500|$|The single-seat triplane had <b>unswept</b> {{rectangular}} wings, {{each with}} a full span of only 4m (13ft1in). [...] These were mounted without stagger, each wing braced to the one below by two pairs of vertical, parallel interplane struts, one pair out beyond mid-span and the other from the fuselage sides. [...] The central wing {{was attached to the}} upper fuselage and the other two held well clear of it by the struts. There were ailerons on each wing.|$|E
2500|$|It was a three bay triplane, the bays {{separated}} by parallel pairs of interplane struts. [...] The fabric covered wings were <b>unswept</b> and had constant chord and blunt tips. [...] The spans decreased a little {{from top to}} bottom plane, so the outer interplane struts leaned outwards; there was little stagger. [...] There were externally connected ailerons on each plane. [...] The [...] Maybach Mb.IV six cylinder inline engines were mounted in the inner bay on the central plane, neatly and fully cowled.|$|E
2500|$|The Aircar was {{a single}} bay biplane with {{parallel}} chord, <b>unswept</b> wings with strong stagger. [...] The wings were built around two wooden spars, with metal ribs and edges but fabric covered; they were fixed to {{the upper and lower}} fuselage. [...] The interplane struts were N-shaped, linking upper and lower spars, aided by one diagonal strut on each side running from the upper rear spar to the lower forward spar. Full span ailerons were fitted to both upper and lower wings.|$|E
2500|$|The Sie-3 has {{a wooden}} {{structure}} and is largely plywood covered. [...] The high set single spar wings {{have the same}} aerodynamic profile throughout, with an <b>unswept</b> centre section of parallel chord and constant thickness over 60% of the span and strongly straight tapered panels outboard. [...] There are aluminium Schempp-Hirth airbrakes near mid-chord on the outer centre section, just behind the spar, and ailerons on the outer panels. [...] The only fabric covering on the wing is over the centre section aft of the spar.|$|E
2500|$|Its {{fuselage}} was flat-sided and rectangular in cross-section, with plywood covering. The prototypes {{differed in}} the way this covering was applied; on one the grain ran diagonally, on the other longitudinally. [...] They also differed in their vertical tails, one broader and lower than the other. [...] Both had deep horn balanced rudders which extended to the keel. The horizontal tail was mounted at mid-fuselage, with a straight-edged, <b>unswept</b> tailplane bearing overhung, balanced elevators with outward increasing chord. Both prototypes had conventional undercarriages with a rigid axle mounted to the lower fuselage by V-form struts.|$|E
2500|$|Except for {{the landing}} gear and engine {{fittings}} and mounts, the airframe is all-composite with an anticipated service life of 20,000 hours. The Scorpion {{is to have a}} [...] payload of precision and non-precision munitions or intelligence-collecting equipment in a simplified and reconfigurable internal bay. The [...] wings are largely <b>unswept</b> and have six hardpoints. A modular design allows for the wings to be removed and replaced by different wing designs. The internal payload bay has a payload capacity of [...] [...] The external hardpoints have a payload capacity of [...]|$|E
2500|$|The primary {{effect of}} {{regeneration}} in a Stirling engine {{is to increase}} the thermal efficiency by 'recycling' internal heat that would otherwise pass through the engine irreversibly. As a secondary effect, increased thermal efficiency yields a higher power output from a given set of hot and cold end heat exchangers. These usually limit the engine's heat throughput. In practice this additional power may not be fully realized as the additional [...] "dead space" [...] (<b>unswept</b> volume) and pumping loss inherent in practical regenerators reduces the potential efficiency gains from regeneration.|$|E
2500|$|The Nimrod had {{an overall}} {{similarity}} to the Fury: {{it was a}} single-seater biplane with an open cockpit, fixed undercarriage and guns firing through the propeller. [...] Its <b>unswept,</b> constant chord, round-tipped wings had an unequal span and strong stagger, the latter partly to enhance the pilot's view. It was a single bay biplane braced with outward-leaning N-form interplane struts, with the upper plane held a little above the upper fuselage by cabane struts. [...] The fabric-covered wings had metal spars and spruce ribs and carried balanced ailerons only on the upper wings.|$|E
2500|$|The Schoettler I was a {{conventional}} European style two seat tractor biplane, rather {{similar to the}} German Aviatik B.II and Albatros B.II designs, with equal span two bay wings. These were mounted with 2° of dihedral and 597mm, almost 2ft, of stagger. [...] The gap between {{the upper and lower}} planes was , maintained by parallel pairs of aerofoil section struts and wire bracing. The <b>unswept</b> wings had a constant chord of [...] with blunt wing tips and ailerons on both upper and lower planes. [...] The Schoettler's empennage was also conventional.|$|E
2500|$|All {{three were}} inverse delta aircraft, that is {{they had a}} wing which was {{triangular}} in plan but with a straight, <b>unswept</b> leading edge. Combined with strong anhedral, this layout produces stable flight in ground effect. Specifically, it is claimed that it is stable in pitch and also that it can fly in ground effect at altitudes up to about 50% of its span, allowing it to operate over rough water. [...] This contrasts with the lower aspect ratio square wing of the Ekranoplans which leaves ground effect at only 10% of span, limiting them to the calmer waters of lakes and rivers.|$|E
2500|$|The Specht has a wooden, two spar, high wing, braced on {{each side}} by V-struts from the spars to the lower fuselage, jury struts and mounted with 2° of dihedral. [...] There is plywood {{skinning}} from the leading edge to the rear spar on the upper surface and to the forward spar below. The {{leading edge of the}} wing is straight and <b>unswept</b> and the trailing edge is parallel to it over its inner section, becoming tapered outboard. Ailerons, with inset hinges, fill these sections. [...] Spoilers are mounted in the mid-inner wing panels at 11% chord.|$|E
2500|$|The TL-96 Star is a single-engine, {{low wing}} {{monoplane}} seating two {{side by side}} under a prominent single-piece, forward-hinging canopy. A second, fixed transparency forms {{the rear of the}} cabin. [...] The structure is all composite, a mixture of glass and carbon fibre reinforced plastics (CFRP). [...] Its wings are <b>unswept</b> and have constant chord apart from a slight rounding of the leading edge at the tips; they carry plain inboard flaps. [...] The one-piece, all-moving tailplane has a similar plan and is fitted with a central anti-balance tab. The fin and rudder are swept, the latter horn balanced. [...] It has a tricycle undercarriage with faired wheels and cable brakes.|$|E
2500|$|The X-113 was {{an inverse}} delta aircraft; that is, {{it had a}} wing which was {{triangular}} in plan but with a straight, <b>unswept</b> leading edge.
