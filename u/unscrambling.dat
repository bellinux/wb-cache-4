The test covers math (word problems and computation) and verbal (reading comprehension, logical reasoning, and grammar skills(it used to be <b>unscrambling</b> paragraphs but they changed it for the 2017 SHSAT test.

25|$|Dream Chronicles: The Book of Air is {{structured}} much like other three previous {{games in the}} series with some major twists. There are lots of improvements in gameplay overall compared to others. It {{is more of a}} quest-like adventure than a traditional hidden object game, a mixing of adventure and puzzle game. Featuring loads of puzzles and logical quests with different difficulties, The Book of Air still assure that puzzles are well-tricky and tightly blended with the story, which is a typical feature of quest or click-and-point games, such as: putting together parts of broken statues, reconstructing tricky mechanisms, <b>unscrambling</b> messages using the power of Dream Jewels and many more. There are no lists of items to find but a huge amount of inventory based puzzles, logical riddles and quests to solve, which have been scattered through the locations in the game. The objects that players find may be used in a scene other than the one they found it in. Objects will stay in inventory until players need to use them. All objects that players are able to pick up will serve a purpose, whether they are used in that scene or not. A lot of times in this game the pieces players pick up may only be used as they get to the next scene. Some items may not become visible in a scene right away, players must perform other tasks first before they become visible.|$|E
5000|$|In {{this round}} the team must <b>unscramble</b> a word together. Each word {{is divided into}} two parts; the first part is always three letters but the last part can be any length. One of the players <b>unscrambles</b> the first three letters of the word; when those three letters are <b>unscrambled,</b> the {{remaining}} letters are revealed for the other player, who must <b>unscramble</b> those letters and say the complete word. Ex. AES - - - - The first player would answer [...] "S-E-A", once correct those letters would rearrange {{and the rest of the}} word is revealed. SEA KISC The partner must now say [...] "S-I-C-K, SEASICK". After each word, the players switch places, so that the player who <b>unscrambled</b> the first part of the word now <b>unscrambles</b> the second part, and vice versa.|$|R

500|$|... 24s minigames {{serve as}} interludes {{from the main}} mission, and are {{primarily}} interrogation sequences or computer puzzles. They are presented both as single puzzles in third-person missions, and as timed stand-alone missions. The computer puzzles include maze puzzles, where a player must select a coloured path from a starting box to an ending box and sometimes a second and third box, are used to represent bypassing locks and other computer functions. Letter sequence puzzles, where a player swaps adjacent pairs {{of a series of}} random letters until they are in the correct sequence, are used to represent code-breaking such as for encrypted files or a locked door. Colour/symbol matching puzzles, where a cursor randomly moves across a field of coloured squares and the player must press the controller button that corresponds to that coloured square, are used to represent <b>unscrambling</b> files from hard drives and other similar functions. A number of other puzzles are used only once, including puzzles to simulate transferring files over a damaged network, infrared scanning of buildings, radar-like scanning of areas, and creating a network link across the entire planet.|$|E
500|$|A Daily Bugle website {{revealed}} Denis Leary as George Stacy, {{lamenting the}} appearance of the wall-crawler and asking whoever spots Spider-Man to e-mail the police. The site hosted the best fan-made Spider-Man scenes. People who uploaded images of [...] "Spider-Man" [...] on the [...] "Webbed Menace" [...] viral site received a poster that sent them to a website for a boxing gym called [...] "Jerera's Boxing Gym". The gym was funded by Peter Parker's school. A viral website of that class was discovered. Entering the correct password revealed Parker's class schedule. The Midtown High School site then revealed a Twitter user tracking down Lizard and asked people in Los Angeles, New York City, Atlanta, Chicago, Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Austin, Tampa, Minneapolis and New Orleans to stay tuned for details. A viral site for Oscorp Industries was available. The Twitter account that coordinated a nationwide effort to track Lizard sightings revealed locations that had packages containing Connors' shredded lab coat, an Oscorp ID badge and scientific samples of reptilian skin. When <b>unscrambling</b> the letters listed on each sample, the words [...] "animal dynamics lab" [...] led players to a new Oscorp Industries site focusing on a science program about reptile genetics. The site depicts Doctor Connors search for interns who could begin applying on May 14. Completing the application and supplying the keyword [...] "Mutagen" [...] unveiled a Lizard featurette. The Oscorp Industries website contained puzzles that revealed two in-game documents, two video updates featuring Connors and a following cipher that as of July 2012 had yet to be cracked. From there images were then unscrambled, revealing a research project with spiders, a letter from Mary Parker to Richard Parker that exposed his workaholic habits and a Daily Bugle newspaper that contained notes about Oscorp.|$|E
2500|$|An American {{version of}} Countdown was tapped in 1990 as an unsold pilot. Hosted by British expat Michael Jackson (a Los Angeles-based radio personality, and {{announced}} by game show veteran Charlie O'Donnell, this version followed {{closely to the}} British version, with a few changes. Civilian contestants were paired up with celebrities and played two games each. Three rounds were played in each game, with a bonus round to the higher scoring team. The first two rounds, like the British version, had each contestant taking turns picking nine letter tiles and attempting to form one word in 30 seconds. Like the British version, the team that formed the longest word was awarded the points based on how many letters were used. Teams were allowed to confer {{with each other in}} the first two rounds. The third round, only eight-letter titles were picked, with the ninth being a [...] "wild card" [...] that the contestant could use anyway they would like. In this round, the contestant is not allowed to confer with their celebrity partner. The player with the highest score after three rounds wins the game and plays the bonus round. Any player that forms a word using all nine letters wins a progressive jackpot (on the pilot episode, that was $25,000). In the bonus round, the contestant works with their celebrity partner to unscramble six words in 45 seconds. Each word gets longer, starting with a four-letter word, then a five-letter word, then a six-letter word, then a seven-letter word, then an eight-letter word, and finally a nine-letter word. The contestant would earn $200 for every unscrambled word, with a prize of $10,000 for <b>unscrambling</b> all six words. Contestants would switch celebrity partners and play another game in the same format (three rounds, with another chance at the bonus round). The contestant with the higher total score at the end of both games would return to the next show. If the contestants tied, both would return to the next show. Five-day champions would win a new car and retire undefeated. The Numbers round and the Conundrum round were both eliminated from the American version.|$|E
