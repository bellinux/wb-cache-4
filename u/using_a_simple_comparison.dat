For many years, nongastrointestinal symptoms have been documented in IBS patients, but the medical literature does not emphasize them.

Information from 200 consecutive patients with IBS and a similar number of patients with Crohn's disease (in a single gastroenterology practice) was obtained at the initial visit <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> questionnaire. <b>Comparison</b> of the data revealed that IBS patients describe certain nongastrointestinal symptoms far more frequently than do those with inflammatory bowel disease.

40|$|Few generalizations in {{the social}} {{sciences}} enjoy such wide-ranging support as that of diminishing marginal utility of income. Put simply, this proposition states that the effect on subjective well-being of a $ 1, 000 increase in income becomes progressively smaller the higher the initial level of income. Distinguished scholars in economics, political science, psychology, and sociology who have made major contributions to the study of subjective well-being concur on this assertion. Its policy appeal is great because it implies that raising the income of poor people or poor countries will raise their well-being considerably, while an increase of equal amount for the rich will have comparatively little effect. The diminishing returns generalization is based on point-of-time bivariate comparisons of happiness with real income, either among or within countries. If, as these cross sectional studies suggest, there is diminishing marginal utility of income, then this point-of-time pattern should be replicated over time as income traverses the range of values covered in the cross sectional analysis. I propose to test whether historical experience reproduces the point-of-time relationship, first, <b>using</b> <b>an</b> international cross section of happiness and income, and then, a within-country one for the United States. As in the studies cited, I <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> bivariate <b>comparison.</b> It turns out that income change over time does not generate the change in happiness implied by the cross sectional pattern. The present analysis is not exhaustive, but it does suggest the need for caution in assuming that cross sectional generalizations about diminishing marginal utility of income can be safely used to anticipate change over time. ...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{electrophysiological}} {{assessment of}} evoked responses from regenerating nerves is challenging {{due to the}} typical complex response of events dispersed over various latencies and poor signal-to-noise ratio. Our objective was to automate the detection of compound action potential events and derive their latencies and magnitudes <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> cross-correlation template <b>comparison</b> approach. For this, we developed an algorithm called Waveform Similarity Analysis. To test the algorithm, challenging signals were gener-ated in vivo by stimulating sural and sciatic nerves, whilst recording evoked potentials at the sciatic nerve and tibialis anterior muscle, respectively, in animals recovering from sciatic nerve transection. Our template for the algorithm was generated based on responses evoked from the intact side.

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{relationship}} between childhood undernutrition and poverty in urban and rural areas. Design: Anthropometric and socio-economic data from Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys in Angola-Secured Territory (Angola ST), Central African Republic and Senegal were used in this analysis. The population considered in this study is children 0 ¿ 59 months, whose records include complete anthropometric data on height, weight, age, gender, socio-economic level and urban or rural area of residence. In addition to <b>simple</b> urban/rural <b>comparisons,</b> the population was stratified <b>using</b> <b>a</b> wealth index based on living conditions and asset ownership to compare the prevalence, mean Z-score and odds ratios for stunting and wasting. Results: In all cases, when <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> urban/rural <b>comparison,</b> the prevalence of stunting was significantly higher in rural areas. However, when the urban and rural populations were stratified <b>using</b> <b>a</b> measure of wealth, the differences in prevalence of stunting and underweight in urban and rural areas of Angola ST, Central African Republic and Senegal disappeared. Poor children in these urban areas were just as likely to be stunted or underweight as poor children living in rural areas. The odds ratio of stunting in the poorest compared with the richest quintile was 3. 4, 3. 2 and 1. 5 in Angola ST, Senegal and Central African Republic, respectively. Conclusions: This paper demonstrates that <b>simple</b> urban/rural <b>comparisons</b> mask wide disparities in subgroups according to wealth. There is a strong relationship between poverty and chronic undernutrition in both urban and rural areas; this relationship does not change simply by living in an urban environment. However, urban and rural living conditions and lifestyles differ, and it is important to consider these differences when designing programmes and policies to address undernutrition...|$|R
40|$|As {{one of the}} world’s oldest continents, Australia has {{experienced}} a complicated geological history and thus has a distinctive landscape and an extensively weathered topography. As such, the gravity field of Australia behaves differently to that in other countries. This paper investigates {{the features of the}} Australian gravity field. The methods <b>used</b> are <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> statistical <b>comparison,</b> Fourier power spectrum analysis and the Hurst lkctal technique. Three test gravity and height profiles, which represent extreme features of the Australian gravity field (ie the Hamersley Ranges, Central Australia and The Snowy Mountains), have been selected. It is shown that the gravity field of Australia is not always correlated with the terrain and the topography often contains longer wavelength features than the gravity anomalies. It is demonstrated that the simple statistical analysis and Fourier power spectral methods are the most informative tools for measuring the smoothness of the gravity field. It is revealed that none of the free-air, Bouguer or topographic-isostatic gravity anomalies is consistently the smoothest type in Australia. Sometimes, the Bouguer anomaly is more variable than the free-air anomaly and thus should not necessarily be used for gravity field gridding in Australia. 1...|$|R
40|$|In a multi-keV {{temperature}} deuterium plasma such as JET, CVI emission {{arises from}} collision processes which, {{in the absence}} of neutral deuterium beam heating, occur near the plasma boundary. Distortions to the CVI Lyman decrement. such as the Ly β/γ/δ ratio and enhancement of the high quantum states (n ∼ 12) are observed. These are correlated to the Dα intensity and consequently to the influx of D° atoms at the plasma boundary. The intensities of the Lyman spectra are interpreted in terms of low energy electron transfer from thermal D° atoms to C+ 6 ions as well as electronic excitation of 6 + 5 ions in their ground state. The line-of-sight emission is modelled <b>using</b> <b>an</b> impurity ion transport code with input data on the electron and D° profiles. Electron transfer from excited states of D° (up to the thermal limit) as well as the ground state have to be included to give satisfactory agreement with the CVI Lyman spectra when the D° influx is high. The cross-sections for charge-transfer from excited states have been estimated <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> Landau-Zener model. <b>Comparison</b> of the relative intensities of the CVI Lyman series Ly β/γ/δ etc with the model calculations allows plausible corrections to be made to the effective charge transfer cross-section as a function of principle quantum number.

40|$|Thesis (M. A., Education (Behavioral Sciences Gender Equity Studies)) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2012. Cyber-bullying {{has become}} rampant among our {{adolescent}} population. Garrett (2003) reports, ???Bullying generally {{begins in the}} elementary grades, peaks in the sixth through the eighth grades, and persists into high school??? (p. 11). So although bullying is a problem at virtually every level of schooling in this country, it is particularly pervasive during the middle school years. Building and maintaining positive social relationships {{is of paramount importance}} to students in this age range. Students??? relationships and conflicts with their peers can often have as much impact on their academic performance and level of success as what and how they are taught by their teachers (Simmons, 2002). In addition to problems with their academic performance, adolescents who are bullied are also sometimes deeply and negatively affected in terms of their healthy social and psychological development (Breguet, 2007). One of the devastating effects of becoming a victim of adolescent cyber-bullying is extreme isolation, so when these victims begin to feel hopeless and even suicidal about their situations, they often do not reach out for help from their parents, friends, or teachers. Students, who feel completely alone, like no one else has ever experienced what they are going through, might be pushed to act on their suicidal feelings. Thus the most damaging psychological effect of bullying that can occur is adolescent suicide (Breguet, 2007). There have been several newsworthy incidents {{over the last few years}} in which young teenagers have committed suicide as a result of being bullied and harassed online. The data analyzed in this study was collected in several sixth, seventh, and eighth grade classrooms in two northern California middle schools. Two different sources of data were collected and examined. The first source was survey questions regarding the frequency and intensity of middle school students??? bullying observations and experiences indicated on a Likert Scale and <b>using</b> <b>a</b> ???yes or no??? format. The second source was open-ended survey questions that gave the respondents the opportunity to express themselves in their own words, providing narratives primarily concerned with the students??? perceived intent of bullies and typical characteristics of victims of bullying. Both types of survey questions included more specific queries regarding the particulars of cyber-bullying and gender issues in bullying. The methodology employed in this study involved both quantitative and qualitative research designs. Quantitative data was analyzed <b>using</b> <b>a</b> Chi-square and <b>simple</b> <b>comparisons</b> of percentages while qualitative data was analyzed utilizing a thematic approach. Traditional schoolyard bullying and cyber-bullying are both major problems in the middle school population. There are many negative repercussions of bullying in the lives of the students who are targeted, including emotional trauma, physical danger (including suicide), interference in healthy social relationships, and academic performance problems. There are several gender differences in bullying, both in terms of how boys bully versus how girls bully and how school authorities deal with the bullying problems among each gender, but there are similarities as well. Boy bullying, for example, has always been more physical than girl bullying. And while it is true that girls still bully primarily using relational aggression, girls have also started to bully more and more using physical tactics. The bullying prevention and intervention strategies currently in place are largely ineffective. As an anti-bullying strategy, schools should look to incorporate character education into their curricula. Education (Behavioral Sciences Gender Equity Studies...|$|R
