5|$|The shuttle {{has moved}} into direct {{sunlight}} and Mission Control is unable to rotate it into a safe position, putting the astronauts' lives in danger. Generoo believes that the <b>uplink</b> is being sabotaged. Belt orders the <b>uplink</b> to be cut, allowing the astronauts to rotate the craft manually. Over the objections of Generoo and the agents, Belt orders the mission to proceed and lies to the press about its progress. Belt tells Mulder that the shuttle program may be cancelled if the mission is not completed successfully.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the single-player missions, The World Is Not Enough features a multiplayer mode where up to four players can compete {{against each other in}} different game types, ranging from the traditional deathmatch to objective-based games such as capture the flag or king of the hill. Other game types include Last Agent Standing, where players begin the game with a finite number of lives and must survive until the opposing players exhaust their lives, and <b>Uplink,</b> in which players must find and touch <b>uplink</b> units scattered in key locations of the map to score points. Multiplayer games can be played on 14 different maps and can also include bots. Bots' appearance and amount of health can be changed to match player preference.|$|E
5|$|A {{short film}} based upon Half-Life {{entitled}} Half-Life: <b>Uplink,</b> {{was developed by}} Cruise Control, a British marketing agency, and was released on March 15, 1999. However, Sierra withdrew it from circulation, after itself and Valve had failed to resolve licensing issues with Cruise Control over the film. The critical reception of the film was very poor. The plot of the film was that a journalist infiltrates the Black Mesa Research Facility, trying to discover what has happened there.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the effect of}} {{introducing}} additional out-of-plane links, called "uplinks" to Bidirectional Manhattan Network (BMN). BMN is a twodimensional grid where the nodes {{of the first and}} the last row and column of the grid are connected thus forming a torus and where all the links are bidirectional. The case where <b>uplinks</b> are assigned randomly to pairs of nodes is considered. We analyze performance for the cases when the number of <b>uplinks</b> in the network is a fraction {{of the total number of}} nodes and when each node has multiple <b>uplinks.</b> It is shown that introducing <b>uplinks</b> reduces the average number of hops and improves network throughput. We also investigate how performance improves with an increasing number of <b>uplinks.</b> Results show that throughput of a large BMN can be significantly improved even with a relatively small number of <b>uplinks.</b> 1 Introduction In the Bidirectional Manhattan Network (BMN) [1] the nodes are organized into a two-dimensional grid where the nodes o [...] ...|$|R

5|$|Blacklist {{also has}} a {{co-operative}} multiplayer mode, where each mission can be accessed by talking with {{the crew of the}} Paladin. Crew members offer a variety of missions and requirements for completing them, and players play as Fisher or his colleague Briggs; both have the same abilities. The game has a total of 14 missions, with split-screen play supported. In addition to co-op and Spies vs. Mercs, Blacklist has other multiplayer modes including <b>Uplink</b> control, Team Deathmatch, and Extraction.|$|E
5|$|After exchanging ideas, Parker {{will write}} a script, {{and from there}} the entire team of animators, editors, technicians, and sound {{engineers}} will each typically work 100–120 hours in the ensuing week. Since the show's fourth season (2000), Parker has assumed most of the show's directorial duties, while Stone relinquished {{his share of the}} directing to focus on handling the coordination and business aspects of the production.

5|$|Burst {{frequency}} offset (BFO) – The {{difference between the}} expected and received frequency of transmissions. The difference is caused by doppler shift as the signals travelled from the aircraft to the satellite to the ground station; the frequency translations made in the satellite and at the ground station; a small, constant error (bias) in the SDU that results from drift and ageing; and compensation applied by the SDU to counter the Doppler shift on the <b>uplink.</b> This measure can be analysed to determine where along the BTO rings the aircraft was located.|$|E

The U.S. successfully repels the EFEC's first attack, but European forces are able to counterattack and reboot Copenhagen's <b>uplinks</b> in their favor. The JSF forces are forced to surrender and are allowed safe passage back to the US in exchange for releasing Pulain.|$|R

5|$|The antennas at TSS serve {{more than}} thirty {{missions}} and contain both a multi-frequency <b>uplink</b> and L, S and X band downlink. In addition there are customer-owned reception, telemetry, tracking and control systems. TSS acts as a local user terminal for the Cospas-Sarsat system used for search and rescue. By {{using a combination of}} SvalSat and TrollSat, customers can download data twice per orbit, twenty-six times per day, with only a forty-minute maximum delay. These are the only two ground stations able to communicate with all orbits of LEO satellites. Tromsø is connected to SvalSat via the Svalbard Undersea Cable System.|$|E
5|$|The third {{multiplayer}} mode is the Combat Simulator, involving {{up to four}} human {{players and}} eight computer-controlled players. Again, a split-screen is used if more than one human is playing. If three or four humans play, the screen is divided into quarters, with one quarter left blank if necessary. Players enter the game unarmed and {{with a certain amount}} of health. Weapons and ammunition are placed around the level in preset positions. Once a player is killed, they are regenerated elsewhere in the level, once again unarmed. The overall objective of the game is determined by the scenario being played. Scenarios range from the traditional deathmatch mode, where players score points by killing their respective enemies, to objective-based games, such as Capture the Flag or King of the Hill. Other scenarios include Hold the Briefcase, where players must take a briefcase and survive with it for as long as possible, and Hacker Central, a gametype where players score points by hacking a computer system using a data <b>uplink.</b> Aspects of each game can be customised, including the chosen map, the weapons available, and the winning conditions. Players can also be grouped into teams or compete individually. In a team game, the players can optionally be shown coloured according to their team. Each game can be customised to a greater degree than was possible in GoldenEye 007s multiplayer mode, such as free weapons selection and placement of shields.|$|E

The player can also win by controlling all of the <b>uplinks</b> on the map at once which grants an instant victory. When over half the <b>uplinks</b> are controlled, DEFCON 1 initiates and access to DEFCON 1 supports is granted.|$|R

5|$|The final race in Europe {{took place}} at Monza. Ferrari's early bid to put Fernando Alonso on pole {{position}} by way of using Felipe Massa to offer him a slipstream ended in disaster when Alonso's rear anti-roll bar failed in the final period of qualifying, leaving the championship leader marooned in tenth while Lewis Hamilton took pole. Hamilton asserted early control over the race, and while Ferrari made significant ground early on to be running second and third – despite losing the data <b>uplink</b> between their cars and the pit wall that provided them with telemetry – it was Sergio Pérez who proved to be Hamilton's biggest challenge. Starting outside the top ten, Pérez elected to start on the harder compound tyres and complete one stop, producing fastest lap after fastest lap as McLaren's confidence was broken when Jenson Button's car was paralysed by a fuel pressure problem. Hamilton would ultimately prevail, but {{he was forced to}} push in the final few laps to maintain his lead, and won the race by four seconds as Pérez claimed his third podium of the season with second place. Alonso went on to finish third, benefiting from Button's retirement and a drive-through penalty for Sebastian Vettel when the reigning World Champion forced him so wide through the Curva Grande that Alonso was forced off the circuit. Bruno Senna later criticised the race stewards for not penalising Paul di Resta for a similar altercation on the approach to the Variante della Roggia early in the race. Meanwhile, with Romain Grosjean serving his suspension, Lotus enlisted former Marussia F1 driver Jérôme d'Ambrosio as their second driver for the weekend. He qualified sixteenth, and went on to finish thirteenth overall.|$|E
