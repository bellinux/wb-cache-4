This has the disadvantages that the efficiencies of solid-phase synthesis are lost in the solution phase steps, that purification from by-products, reagents and <b>unconverted</b> <b>material</b> is required, and that undesired oligomers can be formed if macrocycle formation is involved.|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{a new approach}} for producing highly dispersed supported metal phosphide powders with small particle size, improved stability and increased electrocatalytic activity towards some useful reactions. The approach involves a one-step conversion of metal supported on high surface area carbon to the metal phosphide utilising a very simple and scalable synthetic process. We use this approach to produce PdP 2 and Pd 5 P 2 particles dispersed on carbon with a particle size of 4. 5 – 5. 5 nm by converting a commercially available Pd/C powder. The metal phosphide catalysts were tested for the oxygen reduction, hydrogen oxidation and evolution, and formic acid oxidation reactions. Compared to the <b>unconverted</b> Pd/C <b>material,</b> we find that alloying the P at different levels shifts oxide formation on the Pd to higher potentials, leading to greater stability during cycling studies (20 % more ECSA retained, 5 k cycles) and in thermal treatment under air. Hydrogen absorption within the PdP 2 and Pd 5 P 2 particles is enhanced. The phosphides compare favourably to the most active catalysts reported to date for formic acid oxidation, especially PdP 2, {{and there is a}} significant decrease in poisoning of the surface compared to Pd alone. The mechanistic changes in the reactions studied are rationalised in terms of increased water activation on the surface phosphorus atoms of the catalyst.

40|$|Christian evangelical work across {{national}} boundaries is {{often associated with}} missionary work. In this chapter, I focus on other strategies used in Christian evangelizing, particularly the widespread international dissemination and replication of courses about Christianity for the <b>unconverted</b> using standardized <b>material</b> and approaches. I examine how religious globalization (i. e. the convergence and conformity of religious practice {{across national}} boundaries) through such courses takes place, with the aid of technology, the tapping of shared cultural capital and the intellectualization of religion. I argue that such forms of evangelization work for certain audiences better than for others. Using the case of the Alpha course, an evangelical Christian course originating in London and replicated {{in different parts of the}} world, and focusing on its dissemination and effects in Singapore, I demonstrate how the evangelical material works best with a transnational elite audience with a shared cultural and intellectual capital...|$|R
