Moreover, {{in the event}} of problems with <b>unit</b> <b>shipment,</b> compromised <b>unit</b> quality, thaw mishaps, or graft failure, the time to secure a back-up graft could be unacceptable.

Therefore, we present our use of back-up units over a 5. 5 -year period. Six of 121 CBT recipients (5 %) required back-up unit infusion. Indications included shipment mishaps (n =  2), poor unit viability (n = 2), significant infusion reaction (n = 1), and graft failure (n = 1). Lack of back-up units would have caused transplantation delay or infusion of inferior-quality units. Five of the 6 patients achieved sustained donor engraftment.

40|$|Abstract—Smartphones have {{recently}} overtaken PCs {{as the primary}} consumer computing device in terms of annual <b>unit</b> <b>shipments.</b> Given this rapid market growth, {{it is important that}} mobile system designers and computer architects analyze the characteristics of the interactive applications users have come to expect on these platforms. With the introduction of high-performance, low-power, general purpose CPUs in the latest smartphone models, users now expect PC-like performance and a rich user experience, including high-definition audio and video, high-quality multimedia, dynamic web content, responsive user interfaces, and 3 D graphics. In this paper, we characterize the microarchitectural behav-ior of representative smartphone applications on a current-generation mobile platform to identify trends that might impact future designs. To this end, we measure a suite of widely available mobile applications for audio, video, and interactive gaming. To complete this suite we developed BBench, a new fully-automated benchmark to assess a web-browser’s performance when ren-dering {{some of the most popular}} and complex sites on the web. We contrast these applications ’ characteristics with those of the SPEC CPU 2006 benchmark suite. We demonstrate that real-world interactive smartphone applications differ markedly from the SPEC suite. Specifically the instruction cache, instruction TLB, and branch predictor suffer from poor performance. We conjecture that this is due to the applications ’ reliance on numerous high level software abstractions (shared libraries and OS services). Similar trends have been observed for UI-intensive interactive applications on the desktop. I...|$|E

The study aims to obtain a rational tradeoff between environmental influence and total cost.

Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the applications of the proposed model. Moreover, comparative analysis of the related key parameters is conducted (i. e., carbon emission tax, logistics demand of customers, and economies of scale of RDC), to explore the corresponding effects on the network design of a green supply chain. Moreover, the proposed model is applied in an actual case—network design of a supply chain of an electric meter company in China.

To address these challenges, this manuscript reviews the logistics of the search, selection process, and acquisition of CB grafts as practiced by our center. Topics include who should be considered for a CB search, how to access the global CB inventory, and how to balance total nu-cleated cell dose and human leukocyte anti-gen match in unit selection. We discuss aspects of unit quality and other graft char-acteristics (processing methods, unit age, availability of attached segments, infectious disease, and hemoglobinopathy screening) to be considered.
