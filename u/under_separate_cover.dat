40|$|This tastefully {{produced}} {{collection of}} sixteen essays, nearly all published previously, but in widely disparate journals, plus a long autobiographical introduction {{and a brief}} epilogue, affords an opportunity for evaluating the first two decades of Samuel P. Hays's contributions to American political and social history. Historians excel in different genres. Some are most proficient in the research monograph, some in the popular book or article, some on the editorial chair, some on the lecture platform, some, whose talents remain largely hidden from the professional community, in the small class or tutorial. Hays's métier is the provocative, speculative essay. And while it might be feared that this form of scholarly communication would date more quickly than others, {{in the case of}} Hays, at least, the essays remain fresh. Indeed, their grouping here encourages the reader to make connections between arguments and to realize the larger significance of points he may have missed or bypassed when he first perused the papers <b>under</b> <b>separate</b> <b>covers.</b> It is a book to muse over, scribble on, steal ideas from, rave at-in short, a book designed to stimulate thought...|$|R

Cuts 1 and 3 are inaccurate copies of well known scenes on funeral papyri, and cut 2 is a copy {{of one of the}} magical discs which in the late Egyptian period were placed under the heads of mummies.

Egyptian characters can now be read almost as easily as Greek, and five minutes' study in an Egyptian gallery of any museum should be enough to convince any educated man of the clumsiness of the imposture. The controversy intensified in the late 1960s when portions of the Joseph Smith Papyri were located. The translation of the papyri by both Mormon and non-Mormon Egyptologists does not match the text of the Book of Abraham as purportedly translated by Joseph Smith. Indeed, the transliterated text from the recovered papyri and facsimiles published in the Book of Abraham contain no direct references, either historical or textual, to Abraham, and Abraham's name does not appear anywhere in the papyri or the facsimiles. Edward Ashment notes, [...] "The sign that Smith identified with Abraham ... is nothing more than the hieratic version of ... a 'w' in Egyptian. It has no phonetic or semantic relationship to Smith's 'Ah-broam.'" [...] University of Chicago Egyptologist Robert K. Ritner concluded in 2014 that the source of the Book of Abraham [...] "is the 'Breathing Permit of Hôr,' misunderstood and mistranslated by Joseph Smith", and that the other papyri are common Egyptian funerary documents like the Book of the Dead.|$|E

40|$|A {{before and}} after {{comparison}} of vehicle occupancy distributions for the Atlanta, GA I- 85 HOV to High Occupancy Toll (HOT) lane conversion scheduled for summer 2011, will assess the changes in vehicle and passenger throughput associated with lane conversion. The field deployment plans and data collection methodologies developed for the HOT evaluation {{were the result of}} a comprehensive literature review, an examination of previous data collection methods, an evaluation of the physical characteristics of the I- 85 corridor, and the testing of a variety of equipment/manpower strategies. The case study in this thesis evaluates the established vehicle occupancy methodology for consistency across multiple observers during parallel data collection efforts. The differences noted in exact matches and consistency across the use of the "uncertain" values developed for field implementation is specifically assessed. Results from this study are the first step in assessing the validity of the data collection methods used on the HOT corridor and will yield recommendations for improving the methodology for future occupancy studies.

40|$|Safety {{analyses}} {{have the}} objective of contributing to two essential ingredients of a successful operation. The first is promoting the safety of the operation through worker involvement in information development (safety basis). The second is obtaining approval to conduct the operation (authorization). Typically these ingredients are assembled <b>under</b> <b>separate</b> programs <b>covered</b> by <b>separate</b> DOE requirements. DOE authorization relies on successful development of a document containing up to 21 topics written in terms and language suited to reviewers and approvers. Safety relies on successful training and procedures that convert the technical documented information into terms and language understandable to the worker. This separation can lead to successful incorporation of one ingredient independent of the other. At best, this separation may result in a safe but unauthorized operation; at worst, the separation may result in an unsafe operation authorized to proceed. This guide is based on experiences gained by contractors who have integrated rather than separated the safety and authorization. The short duration of ER/D&D activities, the uncertainties of hazards, and the publicly expressed desire for demonstrable progress in cleanup activities add emphasis to the need to integrate rather than separate and develop new programs. Experience-based information has been useful to workers, safety analysis practitioners, and reviewers in the following ways: (1) Acquiring or developing the needed information in a useful form; (2) Managing the uncertainties during activity development and operation; (3) Identifying the subset of applicable requirements for an activity; (4) Developing the appropriate level of documentation detail for a specific activity; and (5) Increasing the usefulness and use of safety analysis (ownership) ...|$|R

40|$|In 2011, a {{field trial}} was {{conducted}} in southeastern West Virginia to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a live recombinant human adenovirus (serotype 5) -rabies glycoprotein vaccine (ONRAB®) in wild raccoons and skunks. ONRAB® was selected for evaluation based on the success achieved in eliminating raccoon rabies from Ontario and Quebec, Canada, through the integration of this vaccine into rabies management strategies and significantly higher sero-positivity in comparison to Raboral V-RG® in studies along the U. S. -Canada border. The field trial site was composed of forested and agricultural habitats {{in an area where}} raccoon rabies is enzootic and oral rabies vaccine (ORV) has never been used as a management strategy. The ULTRALITE bait is composed of a small blister pack that contains the ONRAB® vaccine with a waxy coating matrix of sweet attractants, impregnated with tetracycline biomarker, camouflaged by a khaki green dye. Approximately 80, 000 baits were distributed at 75 baits/km 2 mostly by fixed wing aircraft along parallel flight lines spaced at 750 m intervals. There were no phone calls related to human or pet bait contacts reported through the affixed, legible toll free phone number on each bait. Relatively low human population density in the study area and bait attributes that may make them less attractive to dogs could have been contributing factors resulting in no reported bait contacts. Histopathology results from up to 23 tissue types from diverse target and nontarget wildlife species samples pre (n= 290) and post-ORV (n= 300) with ONRAB® will be provided <b>under</b> a <b>separate</b> <b>cover</b> once the analysis is completed.

These species that have not been previously evaluated for potential ONRAB® effects are common to the West Virginia field trial site.
