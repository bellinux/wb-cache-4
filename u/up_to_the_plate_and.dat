The Red Sox expected a bunt, but instead the third baseman hit his 31st home run of the season to put the Indians ahead, 4–1. Galehouse was then replaced with Ellis Kinder, who was met with a double by Larry Doby. Kinder responded by getting the next three batters out, which brought the score to 5–1 as Doby also scored. After Bearden got three Red Sox out, the Indians started the fifth inning with {{the top of their}} lineup. Mitchell and Eddie Robinson, who came in for Clark, were out.

Several of the scenes in the episode were shot at the places they stood in for. The gas station scene was filmed at a real gas station across from the series' production headquarters. The supermarket shots were filmed in an actual supermarket, Shop Easy in Port Coquitlam, a first for the series, according to art director Greg Loewen.

500|$|On {{its initial}} broadcast, the episode was watched by 2.998 million viewers. It {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics, with TV Guide ranking the episode No. 95 in its 2009 list of [...] "TV's Top 100 Episodes of All Time". BuddyTV's Don Williams deemed the finale [...] "absolutely fantastic", and ranked it tenth {{on his list}} of the top Supernatural episodes {{of the first three}} seasons. Although he [...] "respected the show for having the guts to follow through with [...] deal"—the ending was a [...] "complete jaw-dropper"—he pointed out the previous times the Winchesters have died and were subsequently resurrected. Memorable moments for Williams include Sam and Dean singing [...] "Wanted Dead or Alive", and Dean admitting that his love for Sam is his main weakness. Likewise, TV Guides Tina Charles described the episode as [...] "creepy and suspenseful and funny and sad and just plain awesome", and felt it came close to outdoing the first-season finale [...] "Devil's Trap". Especially praised were the actors' performances. Padalecki [...] "totally stepped <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> knocked one out of the park", and Ackles was [...] "nine kinds of awesome". On the latter, Charles noted, [...] "From acting out Dean's stubborn ways, his inappropriate humor, those crushing looks of despair and doom and Dean's death, the man can play it all." [...] McCormick was described as [...] "creepy", leading to Charles' [...] "huge compliment" [...] of comparing the episode to The Twilight Zone. For the critic, the [...] "totally unexpected" [...] Bon Jovi sing-along [...] "totally rocked" [...] and has [...] "instantly become a classic". Her main disappointment with the episode, however, was the lack of Sam [...] "going dark side". Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune listed the episode as one of the [...] "gems" [...] of the third season, and believed it likely to end up as one of her [...] "Favorite 'Supernatural' Episodes of All Time". The San Diego Union-Tribunes Karla Peterson agreed, giving the episode a grade of A-. Although it [...] "got off to a shaky start with some weirdly paced scenes", it ended up a [...] "finale that wrapped us in sticky threads of old fears, mind-bending new business and one awesome Bon Jovi song".|$|E

2500|$|The Twins {{surprisingly}} did quite {{poorly in}} 1990, finishing {{last in the}} AL West division {{with a record of}} 74–88, 29 games behind the Athletics, the eventual World Series runner-up. 1991 brought breakout years from newcomers Shane Mack, Scott Leius, Chili Davis, and rookie of the year Chuck Knoblauch, along with consistently excellent performances from stars Hrbek and Puckett. The pitching staff excelled as well, with 20-game winner Scott Erickson, closer Rick Aguilera, and newly acquired free agent, St. Paul native Jack Morris, having all-star years. The Twins defeated the Toronto Blue Jays in five games to win the 1991 ALCS and the Atlanta Braves 4 games to 3 to win the nail-biting 1991 World Series, which is {{considered by many to be}} the greatest of all time. Game 6 is widely considered to be one of the greatest World Series games ever played.

The home run was Puckett's only walk-off home run of his career. In the final and deciding game, Jack Morris pitched a 10-inning shutout, viewed by many baseball historians as one of the greatest pitching performances in a 7th game of the World Series, to beat the Braves 1–0 and bring home the championship to Minnesota. 1991 was considered to be the first season that any team that ended in last place the previous year advanced to the World Series; both the Twins and Braves accomplished the unprecedented feat. ESPN rated the 1991 World Series as the best ever played in a 2003 centennial retrospective of the World Series.
