5|$|One {{approach}} to sustainable living, exemplified by small-scale urban transition towns and rural ecovillages, seeks to create self-reliant communities based on principles of simple living, which maximize self-sufficiency particularly in food production. These principles, {{on a broader}} scale, <b>underpin</b> {{the concept of a}} bioregional economy. These approaches often utilize commons based knowledge sharing of open source appropriate technology.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The <b>underpinning</b> {{plate is}} the main {{load-bearing}} structure in the integral jacking-up process of ancient building. The deformation and mechanical properties of the <b>underpinning</b> plate have impact on the stability {{and the safety of}} the whole integral jacking-up process. The deformation and mechanical properties of the <b>underpinning</b> plate in the loading stage and after the partial unloading stage are analyzed with ANSYS in the integral jacking-up process of a certain ancient building. It is shown that the deflection of the prestressed <b>underpinning</b> beam satisfies the requirement of the design code in the loading stage and after the partial unloading stage, the concrete {{at the bottom of the}} <b>underpinning</b> edge beam will not crack in the loading stage and the concrete at the bottom of the <b>underpinning</b> edge beam will crack after the partial unloading stage...|$|R

The {{completion}} of Canada's first transcontinental railway in 1885 had been a defining moment in Canadian history. Innis's thesis, eventually published as a book in 1923, can be seen as an early attempt to document the railway's significance from an economic historian's point of view. It uses voluminous statistics to <b>underpin</b> its arguments. Innis maintains that the difficult and expensive construction project was sustained by fears of American annexation of the Canadian West.|$|E

5|$|The Truman {{family moved}} into nearby Blair House during the renovations. As the newer West Wing, {{including}} the Oval Office, remained open, Truman walked {{to and from}} his work across the street each morning and afternoon.

The famous exterior of the structure was buttressed and retained while the extensive renovations proceeded inside. The work lasted from December 1949 until March 1952.|$|E

40|$|The {{dissertation}} emphasises the know-how {{needed by}} the owner or the developer to facilitate timely and cost-controlled implementation of <b>underpinning</b> projects. The property owner - in Finland, commonly a residents' association - typically commissions a single <b>underpinning</b> project, {{which means that the}} owner generally does not have any empirical knowledge of such projects. Property owners typically have a choice of several, sometimes dozens, different technical design solutions. The solutions differ in terms of costs, duration and environmental impacts. Some design solutions are only available for properties in those stages of the life cycle where the foundations are still reasonably sound. In Finland, <b>underpinning</b> is needed in many cities. The centre of Helsinki has seen many large foundation projects since the 1980 s. The downtown area has some 120 buildings with wood piling foundations. Respectively, Turku is estimated to have some 400 buildings with wood piling foundations. The projects are relatively large: annually, some 3 - 5 properties are <b>underpinned,</b> using 400 - 900 new piles with a typical length of 10 m- 40 m. A database has been compiled from <b>underpinning</b> projects carried out in Turku, with some 200 different parameters stored from approximately 100 projects. The Database on Turku <b>Underpinning</b> Projects (DATU) {{is one of the largest}} of its kind in the world. The dissertation develops and compiles a new classification for load transfer structures in <b>underpinning.</b> The classification can be used in the estimates of project duration and costs. The research proposes a new model and classification of damage in wood foundations which can be used in the evaluation of the usability of alternative <b>underpinning</b> methods and in the planning of the timing and the costs of <b>underpinning</b> works. The dissertation introduces models which provide reasonable accuracy in forecasting the costs and duration of <b>underpinning</b> projects. The research provides a new finding about the effect of <b>underpinning</b> on the property value. An accelerated decrease in the property value prior to the time of repair was modelled using reasonably extensive data...|$|R
50|$|<b>Underpinning</b> may be {{accomplished}} by extending the foundation in depth or in breadth so it either rests on a more supportive soil stratum or distributes its load across a greater area. Use of micropiles and jet grouting are common methods in <b>underpinning.</b> An alternative to <b>underpinning</b> is the strengthening of the soil {{by the introduction of}} a grout, including expanding urethane-based engineered structural resins.|$|R
5|$|In February 2014, Shelbourne sought court {{approval}} {{to take up}} an offer of up to $135million from Atlas Apartment Holdings intended to <b>underpin</b> the project's emergence from bankruptcy, with a deadline of August 31, 2014 for having a court-approved reorganization plan. At a hearing on March 11, 2014, Shelbourne announced that it had reached agreement on a repayment plan with the project's creditors, including Related Midwest, which had bought up much of the project's debt. Assuming the project finds funding to satisfy that agreement, Atlas said that the building would be built and that Atlas would control the project, but that Kelleher would still be the developer, {{with the intention of}} building the same building planned prior to suspension of construction.|$|E
5|$|Some common uses {{of heavy}} metals {{depend on the}} general {{characteristics}} of metals such as electrical conductivity and reflectivity or the general characteristics of heavy metals such as density, strength, and durability. Other uses depend {{on the characteristics of}} the specific element, such as their biological role as nutrients or poisons or some other specific atomic properties. Examples of such atomic properties include: partly filled d- or f- orbitals (in many of the transition, lanthanide, and actinide heavy metals) that enable the formation of coloured compounds; the capacity of most heavy metal ions (such as platinum, cerium or bismuth) to exist in different oxidation states and therefore act as catalysts; poorly overlapping 3d or 4f orbitals (in iron, cobalt, and nickel, or the lanthanide heavy metals from europium through thulium) that give rise to magnetic effects; and high atomic numbers and electron densities that <b>underpin</b> their nuclear science applications. Typical uses of heavy metals can be broadly grouped into the following six categories.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} plants is vital because they <b>underpin</b> almost all animal life on Earth by {{generating}} {{a large proportion}} of the oxygen and food that provide humans and other organisms with aerobic respiration with the chemical energy they need to exist. Plants, algae and cyanobacteria are the major groups of organisms that carry out photosynthesis, a process that uses the energy of sunlight to convert water and carbon dioxide into sugars that can be used both as a source of chemical energy and of organic molecules that are used in the structural components of cells. As a by-product of photosynthesis, plants release oxygen into the atmosphere, a gas that is required by nearly all living things to carry out cellular respiration. In addition, they are influential in the global carbon and water cycles and plant roots bind and stabilise soils, preventing soil erosion. Plants are crucial to the future of human society as they provide food, oxygen, medicine, and products for people, as well as creating and preserving soil.|$|E
