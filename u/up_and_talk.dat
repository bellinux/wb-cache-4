500|$|In 2010, {{the film}} was mocked on the Internet comedy series Nostalgia Critic, which {{highlighted}} the film's bad acting and writing, but encouraged viewers to see the movie: [...] "It truly {{is one of those}} films you have to see to believe." [...] The episode was taken down following claims of copyright infringement from Wiseau-Films. It was replaced by a short video titled [...] "The Tommy Wi-Show", in which host Doug Walker, dressed as Wiseau, mocked the threatened legal actions. The main review was later reinstated. Both Greg Sestero and Juliette Danielle have praised the review, and Sestero later made a cameo appearance on The Nostalgia Critic episode [...] "Dawn of the Commercials", reprising his role of Mark. Both Wiseau and Sestero appeared in separate episodes on Walker's talk show, Shut <b>Up</b> <b>and</b> <b>Talk.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Right-o," [...] {{said the}} lieutenant. [...] "I'll get my men {{together}} and station them. We can't {{have any trouble}} here, and we won't have. But you'd better get <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> to them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Many will sleep early," [...] he said, [...] "in {{readiness}} for the fight. Others will sit <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk,</b> all night; {{but those who}} intend to sleep will probably do so, {{in a couple of}} hours." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No;--he didn't do that. Had it been {{ten times}} as much, if I owed the money, he would pay it. But he blew me <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> about gambling,--and--and--" ...|$|R
60|$|Won by her tender interest, Dan brightened <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> on till he {{had poured}} {{out all the}} story of that bitter year, and felt better for the load he lifted off.|$|R
6000|$|I {{was rather}} annoyed, because I {{had seen that}} {{particular}} daughter of destruction on the stocks {{only a short time}} ago, and here she was grown <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> about her missing children! ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was several}} {{minutes before the}} man who had been rescued from the sink hole could sit <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk.</b> His hat was gone, and with a dirty face and tangled, muddy hair, he {{presented}} a sorry spectacle.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{you will}} {{when you have}} thought about it quietly by yourself, I won't tell you now how {{surprised}} and disappointed I am, but by and by I will come <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> to you in your room." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's no use making excuses, Charlie. I know I {{ought not}} to {{have given way to}} my temper like that. Now, Lucy dear, as you are feeling better, you must sit <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> to me. How is mother?" ...|$|E
2500|$|On 11 August 1992, Woodrow Wyatt {{noted in}} his diary: [...] " [...] also seems to have formed a new {{alliance}} with Tebbit who stirs her <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>talks</b> a lot of nonsense [...]" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{turned out}} the light convulsively, and rolled over in the bed, making a sort of cocoon of himself. He bored {{his head into the}} pillow and groaned, and then {{struggled}} impatiently to throw the bed-clothes off himself. Then he sat <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> aloud.|$|R
60|$|Her {{father came}} to the station {{with her in the}} morning. The train was not in: <b>and</b> they walked <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down <b>and</b> <b>talked.</b> Suddenly she remembered: it had slipped her mind.|$|R
6000|$|... "Gloom-loving {{but not in}} {{the least}} gloomy. They merely take their sadness pleasurably, just as we are accused of taking our pleasures sadly. Have you noticed that dreadful Klopstock youth has been {{pounding}} past us at shortening intervals. He'll come <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> if he half catches your eye." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{talk that}} fella talk I get cross too much along you," [...] Van Horn {{bristled}} back, and then added, diplomatically, dipping into a half-case of tobacco sawed across and proffering {{a handful of}} stick tobacco: [...] "Much better you smoke 'm <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> 'm good fella talk." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's better," [...] she announced. [...] "He {{had a good}} sleep this {{afternoon}} and when he woke he was quite himself. You'd better go up and see him. I told him all I could {{but he wants to}} see you. Anthony and Lynde are away to Crosse Harbour. Go <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> to him." ...|$|E
3000|$|I withdraw. I’d {{feel pretty}} bloody nervous about {{standing}} <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> {{in front of}} a group and I’d probably stutter and my brain would click in. …With about five or six people I don’t feel comfortable… I mean I’m not going to jump out a window because of it… [...]...|$|R
60|$|He {{met her in}} the corridor, <b>and</b> {{they walked}} <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down <b>and</b> <b>talked,</b> too absorbed {{to be aware of}} the curious eyes that were turned upon them. Joan gave him Carleton's message.|$|R
60|$|The Scarecrow, Scraps and the Pumpkinhead were tireless {{and had no}} need to sleep, so {{they sat}} <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> {{together}} all night; but they stayed outside the house, under the bright stars, <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> in low tones so as not to disturb the sleepers. During the conversation the Scarecrow explained their quest for a dark well, and asked Jack's advice where to find it.|$|R
6000|$|... "That idiot {{has been}} pestering {{me for the}} last half-hour," [...] said Captain Trimblett, after walking for some {{distance}} in wrathful silence. [...] "I wonder {{whether it would be}} brought in murder if I wrung old Sellers’s neck? I’ve had four people this morning come <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> to me about getting married. At least, they started talking." ...|$|E
60|$|The morning wore slowly on. By {{ten o'clock}} Nurse Kennedy {{had so far}} {{recovered}} {{that she was able}} to sit <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> intelligibly. But she was still hazy in her thoughts; and could not remember anything that had happened on the previous night, after her taking her place by the sick-bed. As yet she seemed neither to know nor care what had happened.|$|E
60|$|Mary also {{informed}} {{me that she had}} arranged a very nice couch for Miss Nugent on the afterdeck; that she was lying there now, and felt better; that she wanted to know which I thought the safer ship of the two; and that whenever a little wind arose, and the vessels were blown nearer each other, she wished to get <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> to me herself.|$|E
50|$|Asha {{gives birth}} to a baby boy (Aman). Eventually, she wakes <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>talks</b> with Avni. Avni goes to inform {{the rest of the}} family that Asha has woken up from coma. On the other hand, fraught from the news of Asha's survival, Dayawanti comes to the {{hospital}} and kills Asha by suffocating her.|$|R
60|$|Occasionally, Captain Ewart came <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> to him, but he {{was well}} content to sit {{on one of the}} bales, and listen to the {{conversation}} without joining in it. In another couple of years he, too, would have had his experiences, and would be able to take his part. At present, he preferred to be a listener.|$|R
50|$|It's {{normal for}} friendships to have <b>ups</b> <b>and</b> down. <b>Talk</b> it {{out when you}} hit some bumps.|$|R
60|$|WE {{left for}} St. Louis in the 'City of Baton Rouge,' on a delightfully hot day, {{but with the}} main purpose of my visit but lamely accomplished. I had hoped to hunt <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> with a hundred steamboatmen, but got so pleasantly {{involved}} in the social life of the town that I got nothing more than mere five-minute talks with a couple of dozen of the craft.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've been {{sizing up}} that young man. Strikes me he's {{too much like}} the trash you British are over-fond of dumping on to us. Why can't your people {{understand}} that if a man's a dead failure over there we don't want him? Dare say he's honest, but he's got no sand. Let that fellow sit <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> over a glass of rye whiskey and a bad cigar and he's right there; set him wrestling with a tough job and he'll double up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{think we}} will not do any more to-day, Dias. It has rather taken the heart out of one. Still, we could not expect to hit upon the {{treasure}} for the first time. We will go <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> it over, and when we have smoked a pipe or two we shall {{be more inclined to}} take a cheerful view of the matter. We won't talk about it till we have got to the end of our second pipe." ...|$|E
60|$|The room which Mr Lavender entered {{contained}} two persons, one {{seated at}} a bureau and the other pacing <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> in a powerful bass voice. He paused, looked at Mr. Lavender from under bushy brows, and at once went on walking <b>and</b> <b>talking,</b> {{with a sort of}} added zest.|$|R
50|$|It was in lengthy {{discussion}} with Dish Network. When the station changed format, Dish gave <b>up</b> <b>and</b> dropped <b>talks.</b>|$|R
60|$|The two men tramped <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down, <b>talking</b> earnestly; I {{wondered}} {{what they were}} saying. At last Girolamo stopped.|$|R
60|$|I do {{not know}} {{anything}} so sad as a dinner {{where you are going}} to get up and say something by-and-by, and you {{do not know}} what it is. You sit and wonder and wonder what the gentleman is going to say who is going to introduce you. You know that if he says something severe, that if he will deride you, or traduce you, or do anything of that kind, he will furnish you with a text, because anybody can get <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> against that.|$|E
6000|$|... "That was {{his tone}} all along. He was {{perfectly}} respectful, perfectly polite. Sometimes for days {{not a word}} would be exchanged between us; sometimes he would come <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk,</b> or rather, try to talk, for it was seldom that he got any answer from me. As a rule I sat in my deck chair with Anna beside me, and {{he sat on the}} other side of the deck, or walked up and down, smoking or talking with that man who was with him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mean it? Of course I do. What I can't {{understand}} is {{how people can}} swallow such stuff, election after election. Doesn't every Radical candidate get <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> in the same maudlin way--hasn't he done so for the last fifty years? And when he gets into Parliament is there a more Conservative person {{on the face of}} the earth than the Radical member pledged to social reform? It's the same with your man Henslow. He'll do nothing! He'll attempt nothing! Silly farce, politics, I think." ...|$|E
60|$|Her {{letter was}} more easily written than Percy's. He wrote, <b>and</b> tore <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> considered, <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> to her, <b>and</b> wished John was at home, {{and said that}} Lord Martindale would be {{perfectly}} justified in withdrawing his consent, and declaring him a presumptuous wretch.|$|R
5000|$|The next day, White shows <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>talks</b> {{to all of}} {{the fighters}} and {{particularly}} to Browning and Nelson about their behavior the previous night. He announces that he is giving both fighters a second chance and will not be kicking them out of the house. White tells Nelson that if he is interested in fighting already, he will be next in the first 155 lb fight.|$|R
6000|$|MILLIKEN.--Well--I--I can't say--I--like him--in fact, I don't. But that's {{no reason}} why his mother shouldn't. [During this, HOWELL, preceded by BULKELEY, hands round coffee. The garden without has darkened, as if evening. BULKELEY is going away without {{offering}} coffee to Miss PRIOR. JOHN stamps on his foot, and points to her. Captain TOUCHIT, laughing, goes <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>talks</b> to her now the servants are gone.] ...|$|R
