40|$|Small {{satellites}} {{provide an}} excellent, near-term platform for demonstrating a responsive capability highlighting missions that necessitate quick launch, quick operational capability, with an attendant, very short development schedule. To achieve this rapid response capability, {{there is the}} implication that spacecraft will need to embrace the PC-based concept of Plug-and-Play (PnP), where the user plugs a device into a <b>USB</b> <b>socket,</b> invoking the operating system to find the correct driver, configure the system parameters, and seamlessly makes the device an available resource. Creating a truly modular, PnP spacecraft capability will stretch the industry, particularly in terms of developing guidance, navigation and control (GN 2 ̆ 6 C) systems which are traditionally customized for each specific mission and payload. To facilitate {{the creation of a}} PnP GN 2 ̆ 6 C system, a set of generic algorithms can be created that are not dependent on the sensor suite, or the actuator suite, or the vehicle characteristics. This antithetical approach to the traditional development of GN 2 ̆ 6 C solutions {{can be viewed as a}} disruptive technology, where an upfront investment can result in monumental rewards. This paper will present a mechanism for creating an instant GN 2 ̆ 6 C solution, using the PnP paradigm, to create small satellites that can support new and emerging mission needs...|$|E

Later versions of the Highway products also included built-in universal serial bus (<b>USB)</b> <b>sockets</b> for direct computer access. Home Highway was bought by many home users, usually for Internet connection, although not as fast as ADSL, because it was available before ADSL and in places where ADSL does not reach.|$|R

25|$|Some {{organizations}} forbid {{the use of}} flash drives, {{and some}} computers are configured to disable the mounting of USB mass storage devices by users other than administrators; others use third-party software to control USB usage. The use of software allows the administrator to not only provide a USB lock but also control the use of CD-RW, SD cards and other memory devices. This enables companies with policies forbidding the use of USB flash drives in the workplace to enforce these policies. In a lower-tech security solution, some organizations disconnect USB ports inside the computer or fill the <b>USB</b> <b>sockets</b> with epoxy.|$|R

50|$|Similarly to Germany, Dutch trains {{have had}} two classes since 1956. Currently, only trains running on the Merwedelingelijn and the line Zutphen - Oldenzaal have no first class seats. On two lines in Friesland there are no first class tickets, but the trains (which are also used on lines with first class tickets) do have first class seats. On most {{regional}} and local trains, the difference between second and first class is in only the padding of the seats, an additional armrest, decorative lighting or larger tables. In most cases, the first class in the trains is situated right behind the cabin, preventing others from walking through. On Intercity trains, first class has a 2+1 seating, as opposed to 2+2 in second class, can recline and feature a feet rest in coach seating. Most Intercity trains {{have only a few}} power sockets in first class, but {{this is due to the}} fact that providing a large number of power sockets would require significant modifications to the electrical system. All trains produced after 2015 have power and/or <b>USB</b> <b>sockets</b> in both classes.|$|R

5000|$|In December 2006, the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MII) {{released}} a new China Communications Standards Association (CCSA) standard, [...] "Technical Requirements and Test Method of Charger and Interface for Mobile Telecommunication Terminal Equipment".

All new mobile phones requesting network access approval in China from June 2007 are required to support charging from the new common chargers. The original 2006 regulation is flexible regarding the interface on the mobile phone itself, allowing {{for the use of}} adapter cables if the mobile device is not equipped with a standard USB connector. Among other things, the 2009 update adds references to USB On-The-Go (OTG) support and the use of USB micro-B, micro-AB, mini-B; and Mini-10-pin and cylindrical ("barrel") type connectors on the terminal (phone) for charging.|$|R
