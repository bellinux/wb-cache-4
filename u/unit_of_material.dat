50|$|Conveyors {{are used}} when {{material}} {{is to be}} moved frequently between specific points over a fixed path and {{when there is a}} sufficient flow volume to justify the fixed conveyor investment. Different types of conveyors can be characterized by the type of product being handled: unit load or bulk load; the conveyor’s location: in-floor, on-floor, or overhead, and whether or not loads can accumulate on the conveyor. Accumulation allows intermittent movement of each <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> transported along the conveyor, while all units move simultaneously on conveyors without accumulation capability. For example, while both the roller and flat-belt are unit-load on-floor conveyors, the roller provides accumulation capability while the flat-belt does not; similarly, both the power-and-free and trolley are unit-load overhead conveyors, with the power-and-free designed to include an extra track in order to provide the accumulation capability lacking in the trolley conveyor. Examples of bulk-handling conveyors include the magnetic-belt, troughed-belt, bucket, and screw conveyors. A sortation conveyor system is used for merging, identifying, inducting, and separating products to be conveyed to specific destinations, and typically consists of flat-belt, roller, and chute conveyor segments together with various moveable arms and/or pop-up wheels and chains that deflect, push, or pull products to different destinations.|$|E
50|$|The player {{produces}} the drugs using {{an assembly line}} approach with various equipment that can modify the concentration of the material, combine materials, rearrange {{the effects of a}} material to determine how effects combine when mixed, analyze materials to determine maximum potency levels, and finally prepare the material in pill form for delivery. This is done on an isometric view of building plant floorplan, with various ports along the edges {{that can be used to}} bring in materials or ship out completed drugs. Materials are transported via conveyor belts between the processing units. Added building space can be purchased with in-game funds. The player can click on processes or materials to evaluate their current state, thus giving them the ability to debug the production line. Once the player has produced a complete pill from specific materials for the first time and delivered it to an output port, they are given the opportunity to name the product. This product is then sold on the game's virtual market. The produce is rated on a letter-grade based on the effectiveness and lack of side-effects as well as current market demand. The production lines operate in real-time - in that while the player can pause the game to arrange equipment within a production line, the game while running tracks the movement of each <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> through the production line and only considered each unit as a product when it reaches the end of the production line.|$|E

The delivery of one <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> to a demand node generates a fixed profit, and the shipping of the material through the arcs has an associated cost. We show that in such a framework cooperation is beneficial for the different parties.

40|$|Measures of eco-efficiencyâ??broadly {{understood}} as "getting more from less"â??often include {{an economic and}} an environmental variable. The latter is often seen as the more problematic variable, particularly when used in relation to impacts of public concern. But an analysis of resource and value trends in the U. K. steel and aluminum industries over the last 30 yr showed that there are significant problems associated with using economic variables in measures of eco-efficiency at the sectoral level. The research found that the U. K. steel and aluminum industries have improved the effectiveness with which they use natural resources, but {{that this has been}} accompanied by a decline in the economic output (value added) per <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> or energy consumed. These seemingly contradictory results {{can be explained by the}} fall in the price of metals in real terms, and by the competitive pressures that necessitate the cutting of production costs and indirectly lead to a fall in the measure of economic output of the relevant industry. The research also suggests a logical terminology to bring consistency and coherence to the broad field of eco-efficiency indicators, with an important distinction made between measures that examine the value output per unit of physical input, and measures that examine the physical output per unit of physical input. Both these types of indicators are important, as they highlight different aspects of eco-efficiency. ...|$|E
40|$|Air {{pollution}} and fossil fuel reserves exhaustion are increasing {{the importance of}} the biomass-derived products, in particular wood, as source of clean and renewable energy for the production of electricity or steam. In order to improve the global efficiency and the entire production chain, we have to evaluate the energetic aspects linked to the process of transformation, handling and transport of these materials. This paper reports results on a comparison between two chippers of similar size using different cutting technology: disc and drum tool respectively. During trials, fuel consumption, PTO torque and speed, processing time and weight of processed material were recorded. Power demand, fuel consumption, specific energy and productivity were computed. The machine was fed with four different feedstock types (chestnut logs, poplar logs, poplar branches, poplar sawmill residues). 15 repetitions for each combination of feedstock-tool were carried out. The results of this study show that the disc tool requires, depending on the processed material, from 12 to 18 % less fuel per <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> processed than the drum tool, and consequently, from 12 to 16 % less specific energy.

40|$|A typical verbal-learning trial {{consists}} of two distinct phases, presentation of the ma-terial and attempted recall, or input and out-put. While many different patterns of input and output sequences can be and {{have been used in}} experiments, the two phases are neces-sarily separated in time. A reasonably small <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>material,</b> such as an individual item, can practically always be recalled immediately after its presentation (Murdock, 1961 a, b; Peterson, Saltzman, Hillner, and Land, 1962). In this sense the item is always "learned" when it is presented. If it cannot be recalled following a retention interval, however short, it must have been "forgotten " during that interval. This paper is concerned with intratrial forgetting of individual list items, i. e., with forgetting as it occurs within a single learn-ing trial. Intratrial retention intervals of in-dividual items are filled with inputs and out-puts of other items. These two kinds of inter-vening activities can be regarded as two sources of intratrial interference responsible for forgetting of the critical item. If a list of, say, ten items A, B, C, [...] ., I, J, is presented to S in this order and at a fixed rate, and S is then asked to recall these items in the same order and at the same rate, the length of the intratrial retention interval is identical for all items, but the particular combination of intervening inputs and out-puts varies for items in different serial posi...|$|E
40|$|The mine {{planning}} process converts resources into economically mineable reserves, focusing on value addition and risk reduction. Equipment selection is traditionally addressed {{late in the}} process and addresses production capacity, equipment matching and equipment allocation. The primary focus being to reduce the operating cost per <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> handled. Mineral resource management is an integration of the key functions in the mining process. A focus on resource utilisation {{plays a key role in}} the management process and leads to the question whether lower operating costs always add value in the long term. It was determined that traditional equipment selection methods are not effective for all mineral deposits and might even be short sighted, destroying value over the long term. The mine {{planning process}} was adapted to allow for an early investigation into the potential for increased recovery. The effect of selectivity in the loading action is simulated in a 3 D environment over a range of bench heights. The results are analysed with a grade tonnage curve and the saleable product at each bench height is calculated, taking account of the required product qualities. The concept of financial materiality is applied to classify the resource as either a massive or selective deposit. A massive deposit support the traditional drive for bigger equipment and will benefit from lower operating costs. A selective deposit requires less focus on production capacity, equipment matching and allocation and more on resource recovery. In order to take advantage of the potential indicated in the evaluation, it is necessary to modify the traditional equipment selection techniques. A thorough understanding of the capabilities of the loading equipment is required in an attempt to match these abilities with the geometry of the ore deposit. The objective is to identify the equipment that will ensure the highest mining recovery at the lowest cost. This will be achieved when the loading equipment can attain a mining recovery smaller than the bench height it is mining or if the equipment can be applied economically on small bench heights. The most suitable equipment can only be determined at the hand of a total value chain costing analyses. This means that the production cost i. e. the cost to produce the final product must be evaluated and not the operating cost i. e. the cost to move a <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>material,</b> as is often the case. The proposed mine planning approach and equipment selection technique was used on the Thabazimbi iron ore mine deposits. The results indicated that the NPV of the project could be increased dramatically. It was concluded that the ability to load selectively cannot be calculated mathematically. It is a judgment made on a thorough evaluation of the design and operating features of the shovel in conjunction with the ore body geometric parameters and the loading face conditions. The efficiency of the selected shovel can be manipulated through the application of different bench heights, and the optimum combination can only be determined through a total value chain costing analyses.

40|$|Within {{the forest}} sector, the {{sustainability}} concept {{has evolved from}} a narrow focus on sustainable wood production to a much broader evaluation of environmental, social, and economic sustainability for whole value chains. A new software tool – ToSIA – has been developed for assessing sustainability impacts of Forest-Wood-Chains (FWCs). In the approach, FWCs are defined as chains of production processes (e. g. harvesting–transport–industrial processing), which are linked with products (e. g. a timber frame house). Sustainability is determined by analysing environmental, economic, and social sustainability indicators for all the production processes along the FWC. The tool calculates sustainability values as products of the relative indicator values (i. e. indicator value expressed per <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> flow) multiplied with the material flow entering the process. Calculated sustainability values are then aggregated for the segments of the FWC or for the complete chain. The sustainability impact assessment requires carefully specified system boundaries. ToSIA uses a data-oriented approach that is very flexible in {{the focus of the}} analysis and the selection of indicators of sustainability. An example of alternative Norway spruce management systems in Southern Germany and their effects on six sustainability indicators is presented. The less intensive management system with natural regeneration and motor–manual harvesting shows higher carbon storage and slightly less energy use. It creates more employment and higher labour costs, but the average rate of accidents is also higher. ToSIA offers a transparent and consistent methodological framework to assess sustainability impacts in the forest-based sector as affected, e. g. by changes in policies, market conditions, or technology.
