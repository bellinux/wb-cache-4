MIMO BC systems have an outstanding advantage over point-to-point MIMO systems, especially {{when the number of}} transmit antennas at the transmitter, or AP, is larger than the number of receiver antennas at each receiver (user).

5000|$|In {{multiuser}} MIMO systems {{where the}} number of users are higher than {{the number of}} transmit antennas, a multiuser diversity can be achieved by performing <b>user</b> <b>scheduling</b> before applying zero-forcing beamforming. Multiuser diversity is a form of selection diversity among users, the base station can schedule its transmission to those users with favorable channel fading conditions to improve the system throughput. In order to achieve multiuser diversity and apply zero-forcing precoding, the CSI of all users are required at the base station. However, the amount of overall feedback information increases with the number of users. Therefore, it is important to perform a user selection at the receiver side to determine the users which are fed back their quantized channel state information to the transmitter side based on pre-defined threshold.|$|E

Many kinds of <b>user</b> <b>scheduling</b> algorithms, however, fail to fully realize the advantages of MU-MIMO due to considerable channel state information (CSI) overhead. In this paper, we propose a new MU-MIMO MAC protocol, called 802.11 ac+, including a novel <b>user</b> <b>scheduling</b> algorithm. Unlike most proposals, where <b>user</b> <b>scheduling</b> is performed after an access point (AP) receives CSI from all users, 802.11 ac+ determines the best user set during the CSI feedback phase. In particular, the AP broadcasts a channel hint about previously scheduled users, and the remaining users actively send CSI reports according to their effective channel gains (ECGs) calculated from the hint. Based on the proposed scheme, we develop two fair scheduling protocols, Round-Robin 802.11 ac+ (RR- 11 ac+) and Proportional-Fair 802.11 ac+ (PF- 11 ac+).
