40|$|The aim of {{this project}} {{was to assess the}} {{feasibility}} of using UV spectroscopy for a simple detection system for formaldehyde gas in the indoor environment. Formaldehyde gas is hazardous to human health causing irritation of the eyes, nose and throat, headaches, limited pulmonary function and is a potential carcinogen. Formaldehyde derivatives are used in plywood and fibre board, carpeting, fabrics and some paints. The gas can be emitted from these materials and can build up in the indoor environment. Current methods for detecting formaldehyde gas that are simple, reliable and inexpensive are limited. A literature study of chemicals common to the indoor environment was carried out, and their UV absorption spectra compared to that of formaldehyde. 85 substances and substance groups were considered, 11 of which had absorption spectra that overlapped with the formaldehyde UV absorption band. A region was found between 320 and 360 nm with very little spectral interference. Given the number of gases considered, this was a surprising result. Formaldehyde has several strong absorption peaks between regions of very low absorption, allowing for low resolution detection using a single LED source. Two prototype detection systems were developed. The first used a <b>UV</b> <b>LED</b> <b>light</b> source and used a beam splitter to provide one detection channel and one reference channel. The channels used narrow band (laser-line) optical filters. It was thoroughly optimised for noise performance, giving a best case limit of detection of 4. 2 ppm, limited by source fluctuation and shot noise, and LED thermal drift. Future developments could include a temperature controller inside the casing of the LED, or a multi- pass gas cell to increase sensitivity. With only two channels, the two filter system was susceptible to spectral interference from nitrogen dioxide and nitric acid. The second prototype system was developed using a novel method of passing un-collimated light through a laser-line filter to produce multiple wavelength channels with an angular spread. The principle was validated using two-channel detection with a limit of detection of 6 ppm...|$|E

Specifically, this technology incorporates TiO 2 coatings and materials applied to, or integrated as a part of, the optical surfaces of sensors and calibration sources, including lenses, windows, and mirrors {{that are used in}} remote, unattended, ground-based (land or maritime) optical sensor systems. Current methods used to address contamination or biofouling of these optical surfaces in deployed systems are costly, toxic, labor intensive, and non-preventative. By implementing this novel technology, many of these negative aspects can be reduced. The functionality of this innovative self-cleaning solution {{to address the problem of}} contamination or biofouling depends on the availability of a sufficient light source with the appropriate spectral properties, which can be attained naturally via sunlight or supplemented using artificial illumination such as <b>UV</b> <b>LEDs</b> (<b>light</b> emitting diodes). In land-based or above-water systems, the TiO 2 optical surface is exposed to sunlight, which catalyzes the photocatalytic reaction, facilitating both the decomposition of inorganic and organic compounds, and the activation of superhydrophilic properties. Since underwater optical surfaces are submerged and have limited sunlight exposure, supplementary UV light sources would be required to activate the TiO 2 on these optical surfaces. Nighttime operation of land-based or above-water systems would require this addition as well. For most superhydrophilic self-cleaning purposes, a rainwater wash will suffice; however, for some applications an attached rainwater collector/ dispenser or other fresh water dispensing system may be required to wash the optical surface and initiate the removal of contaminates. Deployment of this non-toxic,non-hazardous-technology will take advantage of environmental elements (i. e. rain and sunlight), increase the longevity of unattended optical systems, increase the amount of time between required maintenance, and improve the long-term accuracy of sensor measurements...|$|R

In this study, the <b>UV</b> <b>LED</b> curing formulations of polyacrylamide (PAAm) hydrogels were developed. The formulations consisted of acrylamide (AAm) as a main monomer, N,N’-methylenebisacrylamide as a crosslinker and photoinitiator. <b>UV</b> <b>LED</b> emits monochromatic <b>light</b> sources only (365 nm or 385 nm). Thus, in order to developed formulation of <b>UV</b> <b>LED</b> curable hydrogels, a suitable water soluble photoinitiator (i. e. λ ~ 365 nm) has to be employed. A commercially available photoinitiator Oligo [2 -hydroxy- 2 -methyl- 1 -[4 -(1 -methylvinyl) phenyl] propanone] under the trade name Chivacure 300 (λ ~ 330 nm) was chosen in the first formulations. However, due to limited solubility in water, addition of tetrahydrofuran (THF) at 9. 5 : 0. 5 ratio of water/THF was required for Chivacure 300. We also synthesized a photoinitiator based on 2, 2 -dimethoxy- 2 -phenyl acetophenone (DMPA) and methylated-ß-cyclodextrin (MßCD) {{to be used in}} the second formulation.

In addition, different synthesis methods are analyzed and compared, with the goal of obtaining ideal phosphors, which should have not only have high luminous output but also optimal particle size (~ 150 - 400 nm) and spherical morphology.

Simulation results show that, when the structural parameters of the nanorod LED are optimized, LEE can be higher than 50 % and 60 % for the transverse electric (TE) and TM modes, respectively. The nanorod structure is expected to be a good candidate for the application to future high-efficiency deep <b>UV</b> <b>LEDs.</b>|$|R
40|$|Proof mass {{electrical}} charge management {{is an important}} functionality for the ST- 7 -LTP technology demonstration flight and for LISA. Photoemission for charge control is accomplished by using deep ultraviolet (UV) light to excite photoelectron emission from an Au alloy. The conventional UV source is a mercury vapour lamp. We propose and demonstrate charge management using a deep <b>UV</b> <b>light</b> emitting diode (<b>LED)</b> source. We have acquired selected AlGaN <b>UV</b> <b>LEDs,</b> characterized their performance and successfully used them to realize charge management. The <b>UV</b> <b>LEDs</b> emit at a 257 nm central wavelength with a bandwidth of ∼ 12 nm. The UV power for a free-space LED is ∼ 120 µW, and after fibre coupling is ∼ 16 µW, more than sufficient for LISA applications. We have directly observed the <b>LED</b> <b>UV</b> light-induced photocurrent response from an Au photocathode and an Au-coated GRS/ST- 7 proof mass. We demonstrated fast switching of <b>UV</b> <b>LEDs</b> and associated fast changes in photocurrent. This allows modulation and continuous discharge t...|$|R

An alternative to this process is the UV disinfection of drinking water. Most of the devices in the market use UV bulbs or mercury lamps. The <b>UV</b> <b>LED,</b> which is cheaper and smaller, allows creating new smaller devices.

40|$|As {{a future}} charge {{management}} light source, UV light-emitting diodes (<b>UV</b> <b>LEDs)</b> offer far superior {{performance in a}} range of metrics compared to the mercury lamps used in the past. As part of a qualification program a number of short wavelength <b>UV</b> <b>LEDs</b> have been subjected to a series of lifetime tests for potential use on the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. These tests were performed at realistic output levels for both fast and continuous discharging in either a DC or pulsed mode of operation and included a DC fast discharge test spanning 50 days, a temperature dependent pulsed fast discharge test spanning 21 days and a pulsed continuous discharge test spanning 507 days. Two types of <b>UV</b> <b>LED</b> have demonstrated lifetimes equivalent to over 25 years of realistic mission usage and provide a baseline and backup solution for LISA...|$|R
