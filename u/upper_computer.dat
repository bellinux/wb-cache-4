30|$|The {{commonly}} used structure of centralized temperature control systems is the bi-layer structure with <b>upper</b> <b>computer</b> directly controlling thermostats. But {{this kind of}} structure has obvious drawbacks, such as high cost, inability to scale up, low degree of intelligence, etc.. This paper presents a design scheme of an intelligent three-tier structure, namely thermostats, intelligent logging devices, and <b>upper</b> <b>computer.</b> The <b>upper</b> <b>computer</b> can read data directly from both thermostats and logging devices. This scheme can solve the problems in bi-layer structure well, {{and it is also}} suitable for other types of large-scale control system. However, there still exists data loss problem in this scheme when systems reach a great scale. A method of using historical data in the database and linear feature of temperature curves is also proposed in this paper to improve data collection algorithm, which preferably solve this data loss problem. Appropriate products have been developed based on the techniques of this scheme, and have been applied in practical industrial production and experimental teaching.|$|E

40|$|We {{characterize}} the time {{evolution of a}} d-dimensional probability distribution by {{the value of its}} final entropy. If it is near the maximally-possible value we call the evolution mixing, if it is near zero we say it is purifying. The evolution is determined by the simplest non-linear equation and contains a d times d matrix as input. Since we are not interested in a particular evolution but in the general features of evolutions of this type, we take the matrix elements as uniformly-distributed random numbers between zero and some specified <b>upper</b> bound. <b>Computer</b> simulations show how the final entropies are distributed over this field of random numbers. The result is that the distribution crowds at the maximum entropy, if the upper bound is unity. If we restrict the dynamical matrices to certain regions in matrix space, for instance to diagonal or triangular matrices, then the entropy distribution is maximal near zero, and the dynamics typically becomes purifying.
