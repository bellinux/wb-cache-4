DSL takes advantage of this <b>unused</b> <b>bandwidth</b> of the local loop by creating 4312.5 Hz wide channels starting between 10 and 100 kHz, depending on how the system is configured. Allocation of channels continues at higher and higher frequencies (up to 1.1 MHz for ADSL) until new channels are deemed unusable. Each channel is evaluated for usability {{in much the same way}} an analog modem would on a POTS connection. More usable channels equates to more available bandwidth, which is why distance and line quality are a factor (the higher frequencies used by DSL travel only short distances). The pool of usable channels is then split into two different frequency bands for upstream and downstream traffic, based on a preconfigured ratio. This segregation reduces interference. Once the channel groups have been established, the individual channels are bonded into a pair of virtual circuits, one in each direction. Like analog modems, DSL transceivers constantly monitor the quality of each channel and will add or remove them from service depending on whether they are usable. Once upstream and downstream circuits are established, a subscriber can connect to a service such as an Internet service provider or other network services, like a corporate MPLS network.|$|E

In the last few years, many channel dependent mechanisms are proposed {{to address this issue}} based on the cross-layer design philosophy. However, a lot of problems remain before more efficient solutions are found. One of the problems is how to alleviate the conflict between throughput and fairness for different prioritized traffic, especially how to avoid the bandwidth starvation problem for low priority traffic when the high priority traffic load is very high. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme named Courtesy Piggybacking (CP) to address this problem. With the recognition of inter-layer coupling, our Courtesy Piggybacking scheme exploits the channel dynamics and stochastic traffic features to alleviate the conflict. The basic idea is to let the high priority traffic help the low priority traffic by sharing <b>unused</b> residual <b>bandwidth</b> with courtesy.

The key idea of TCPW is to use Eligible Rate Estimation (ERE) methods to set the congestion window (cwnd) and slow start threshold (ssthresh) after a packet loss. ERE is defined as the transmission rate a sender ought to use to achieve high utilization and remain friendly to other TCP variants. This paper presents TCP Westwood with Agile Probing (TCPW-A), a sender-side only enhancement of TCPW. TCPW-A perform well when faced with highly dynamic bandwidth, large propagation time/bandwidth, and random loss in the current and future heterogeneous Internet. TCPW-A achieves its goal by incorporating the following two mechanisms: 1) When a connection initially begins or re-starts after a Timeout, instead of exponentially expanding cwnd to an arbitrary preset ssthresh and then going into linear increase, TCPW-A uses Agile Probing, a mechanism that repeatedly resets ssthresh based on ERE and forces cwnd into an exponential climb each time. The result is fast convergence to a more appropriate ssthresh value. 2) In Congestion Avoidance, TCPW-A invokes Agile Probing upon indication of <b>unused</b> extra <b>bandwidth</b> via a scheme we call Load Gauge (LG).
