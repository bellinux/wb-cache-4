50|$|Oswald Jozef Leroy (Passendale, Belgium, 1936) is a Belgian {{mathematician}} {{known for}} his contributions to theoretical acousto-optics. Leroy's biggest achievement was a theoretical study of the interaction of light with two adjacent ultrasonic beams under different conditions in terms of beam shape, frequency content and intensity. Understanding of this phenomenon was very important in the 1970s when new acousto-optic devices were developed (mainly due to novel developments in laser technology) that utilized adjacent ultrasonic beams. Such devices were being used in optical modulators, optical scanners, information processing, optical filtering and frequency-spectrum analysis. Before his contribution only the interaction of light with one <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>beam</b> was understood.

40|$|Abstract — Recently, {{cardiovascular}} disease {{has become the}} second most common cause of death in Japan following malig-nant neoplasm formation. Therefore, it is necessary to diagnose atherosclerosis during its early stages because atherosclerosis {{is one of the main}} causes of {{cardiovascular disease}}s. The carotid sinus is a site that is easily affected by atherosclerosis [C. K. Zarins et al. : Circ. Res. 53 (1983) 502]; therefore, the diagnosis of this disease at this site is important [S. C. Nicholls et al. : Stroke 20 (1989) 175]. However, it is difficult to accurately diagnose atherosclerosis in the carotid sinus in the long-axis plane, which is parallel to the axis of the vessel, using conventional linear scanning because the carotid sinus is not flat along the axis of the vessel, and the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>beams</b> used in linear scanning are perpendicular to the arterial wall in a limited region. Echoes from regions that are not perpendicular to the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>beams</b> are very weak and the arterial wall in such regions is hardly recognized in a B-mode image. In this study, the position of the arterial wall was predetermined on the basis of the B-mode image obtained by conventional linear scanning, then <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>beams</b> were transmitted again so that all beams were almost perpendicular to the arterial wall. In basic experiments, a nonflat object made of silicone rubber was measured and it was shown that it is possible to image a nonflat object over the entire scanned area using the proposed beam steering method. Furthermore, in in vivo experiments, the intima-media complex was imaged over the entire scanned area at the carotid sinus. I...|$|R
50|$|This type of {{flow meter}} {{can also be}} used to measure the rate of blood flow, by passing an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>beam</b> through the tissues, {{bouncing}} it off a reflective plate, then reversing the direction of the beam and repeating the measurement, the volume of blood flow can be estimated. The frequency of the transmitted beam is affected by the movement of blood in the vessel and by comparing the frequency of the upstream beam versus downstream the flow of blood through the vessel can be measured. The difference between the two frequencies is a measure of true volume flow. A wide-beam sensor {{can also be used}} to measure flow independent of the cross-sectional area of the blood vessel.|$|E
5000|$|Audio Spotlight is {{a narrow}} beam of sound {{that can be}} {{controlled}} with similar precision to light from a spotlight. It uses a beam of ultrasound as a [...] "virtual acoustic source", enabling control of sound distribution.The ultrasound has wavelengths only a few millimeters long which are {{much smaller than the}} source, and therefore naturally travel in an extremely narrow beam.The ultrasound, which contains frequencies far outside the range of human hearing, is completely inaudible. But as the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>beam</b> travels through the air, the inherent properties of the air cause the ultrasound to change shape in a predictable way.

50|$|Ultrasonic Doppler {{flow meters}} measure the Doppler shift {{resulting}} from reflecting an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>beam</b> off the particulates in flowing fluid. The {{frequency of the}} transmitted beam {{is affected by the}} movement of the particles; this frequency shift can be used to calculate the fluid velocity. For the Doppler principle to work there must be a high enough density of sonically reflective materials such as solid particles or air bubbles suspended in the fluid. This is in direct contrast to an ultrasonic transit time flow meter, where bubbles and solid particles reduce the accuracy of the measurement. Due to the dependency on these particles there are limited applications for Doppler flow meters. This technology is also known as acoustic Doppler velocimetry.|$|E

50|$|Microneurography {{is based}} on {{tungsten}} needle electrodes which are inserted through the skin and into a nerve. Anaesthetics are not required because surprisingly the procedure is not very painful. The tungsten microelectrodes have a shaft diameter of 100-200 μm, a tip diameter of 1-5 μm, and they are insulated to the tip with an epoxy resin. Electrode impedance varies between 0.3 and 5 MΩ at 1 kHz as measured initially. However, the impedance tends to decrease during experiment and is usually below 1 MΩ while impulses are recorded. Nerve discharges are determined by voltage differences between the intra-neural electrode and a reference needle electrode in the vicinity. The 2 electrodes are connected to an amplifier with a high input impedance and an appropriate band-pass filtering, often 500 to 5000 Hz. Signals are monitored {{on a computer screen}} and stored on a hard disc for off-line analysis. Any peripheral nerve that can be reached may be a target for microneurographical recordings, although so far only arm, leg, and facial nerves have been exploited. In order to locate the nerve, electrical stimulation through a needle electrode or ultrasonic monitoring is often used. Weak electrical shocks are delivered either through the recording electrode or through a separate stimulation needle while neural response is observed, either a muscle twitch or a cutaneous sensation reported by the subject.In ultrasonic monitoring a linear, high frequency ultrasound probe is used.The microelectrode is then inserted 1-2 cm from the probe, ideally in a 90° angle to the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>beam.</b> This generates the best wave reflection and image. Ultrasonic approach accurately locates the depth of the nerve and identifies surrounding anatomical structures of interest, such as blood vessels and bony structures, which may affect the placement of a microelectrode. A particular advantage is that the ultrasonic approach visualizes the electrode and the nerve at the same time, thereby facilitating electrode manipulation to reach the nerve. Once the electrode tip is in the nerve, small adjustments are required, first, to penetrate the sheath of an individual fascicle and, second, to take the tip to contact nerve fibers of the kind you are interested to explore, be it multi-unit sympathetic activity or single unit activity of either a myelinated afferent or a small unmyelinated fibres. The search procedure requires considerable skill and patience as it may be very tedious particularly with small nerves or nerves located deep below the skin surface.|$|E
