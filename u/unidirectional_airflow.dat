50|$|A {{recent study}} of the lungs of the American {{alligator}} {{has shown that the}} airflow through them is unidirectional, moving in the same direction during inhalation and exhalation. This is also seen in birds and many non-avian dinosaurs, which have air sacs to further aid in respiration. Both birds and alligators achieve unidirectional air flow through the presence of parabronchi, which are responsible for gas exchange. The study has found that in alligators, air enters through the second bronchial branch, moves through the parabronchi, and exits through the first bronchial branch. <b>Unidirectional</b> <b>airflow</b> in both birds and alligators suggests that this type of respiration was present in basal Triassic archosaurs and their non-dinosaurian descendants, including phytosaurs, aetosaurs, rauisuchians, crocodylomorphs, and pterosaurs. The use of <b>unidirectional</b> <b>airflow</b> in the lungs of archosaurs may have given the group an advantage over synapsids, which had lungs where air moved tidally in and out through a network of bronchi that terminated in alveoli, which were cul-de-sacs.

40|$|Cleanroom air-recirculation systems {{typically}} {{account for}} {{a significant portion of}} the HVAC energy use in cleanrooms. High electric power density is normally required for fans to deliver large volume of airflows that were designed, supplied, recirculated, and exhausted within a given time. With the increasing demand for specific contamination control, it is important to optimize design of clean spaces. Best practice in cleanroom air system design includes right-sizing the systems in cleanrooms and adopting minienvironments. Implementing and integrating minienvironments in cleanrooms can improve contamination control and save significant energy. A minienvironment is a localized environment created by an enclosure to isolate a product or process from the surrounding environment. The advantages in using minienvironments include the following: (1) Minienvironments may create better contamination control and process integration. (2) Minienvironments may maintain better contamination control by better control of pressure difference or through use of <b>unidirectional</b> <b>airflows,</b> e. g., cleanliness-class upgrade required for certain process. (3) Minienvironments may potentially reduce energy costs. The use of fan-filter units (FFU) in minienvironments is common. The energy efficiency of such air-delivery systems can vary significantly because of the difference in energy performance, airflow paths, and operating conditions. Simply adding minienvironments with fan-filter units in an existing cleanroom will increase power density and energy intensity for delivering airflow in the space served, if everything else is unchanged. However, by considering contamination control requirements in the various spaces minienvironments can be integrated with the surrounding cleanroom to optimize the overall electric power demand for the facility and to achieve specific cleanliness in each area. In addition, selecting energy efficient minienvironment systems will further improve the overall energy efficiency of the clean spaces...|$|R

50|$|Although they evolved bipedal {{locomotion}} independently, Poposaurus and dinosaurs {{inherited a}} propensity for erect hind-limb driven movement {{from an early}} archosaur ancestor. The posture of this ancestral archosaur can be inferred from a method called extant phylogenetic bracketing. Archosauria is a crown group represented today by birds and crocodilians, meaning that the first archosaur was the last common ancestor of all birds and crocodilians. All birds have a fixed erect stance, and crocodilians {{have the ability to}} high walk with their limbs erect. If an erect stance is considered homologous in birds and crocodilians, phylogenetic bracketing implies that they inherited this trait from their common ancestor and that this ancestor also had an erect stance. With this reasoning, the first archosaurs are thought to have had the ability to high walk. Poposaurus and dinosaurs achieved a bipedal posture as their legs increased in size, their hips strengthened, and their spines adapted for dorsoventral flexion. Other adaptations that may have facilitated bipedal locomotion include the development of a chambered heart and lungs with <b>unidirectional</b> <b>airflow</b> (both of which are assumed present in Poposaurus through phylogenetic bracketing).|$|E

40|$|The lungs {{of birds}} {{have long been}} known to move air in only one {{direction}} during both inspiration and expiration {{through most of the}} tubular gas-exchanging bronchi (parabronchi). Recently a similar pattern of airflow has been observed in American alligators, a sister taxon to birds. The pattern of flow appears to be due to the arrangement of the primary and secondary bronchi, which, via their branching angles, generate inspiratory and expiratory aerodynamic valves. Both the anatomical similarity of the avian and alligator lung and the similarity in the patterns of airflow raise the possibility that these features are plesiomorphic for Archosauria and therefore did not evolve in response to selection for flapping flight or an endothermic metabolism, as has been generally assumed. To further test the hypothesis that <b>unidirectional</b> <b>airflow</b> is ancestral for Archosauria, we measured airflow in the lungs of the Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus). As in birds and alligators, air flows cranially to caudally in the cervical ventral bronchus, and caudally to cranially in the dorsobronchi in the lungs of Nile crocodiles. We also visualized the gross anatomy of the primary, secondary and tertiary pulmonary bronchi of C. niloticus using computed tomography (CT) and microCT. The cervical ventral bronchus, cranial dorsobronchi and cranial medial bronchi display similar characteristics to their proposed homologues in the alligator, while there is considerable variation in the tertiary and caudal group bronchi.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 7 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Turkey, 19 - 21 July, 2010. Open-cell metal foam has enjoyed significant industrial and scientific interest as a viable multi-functional engineering material. Metal foam posses a number of advantageous properties. Several applications require fluid flow through the open pores of metal foam. A key flow property of metal foam is the permeability, which has been subject to research and debate for a long time. This paper presents a new approach for evaluating this critical transport property by considering the physics of energy dissipation, i. e., the viscous shear and form drag. The current work emphasizes the necessary initial step of clearly distinguishing between different flow regimes (Darcy and Forchheimer), prior to evaluating the permeability. This distinction is sometimes absent or overlooked in several previous studies. The new approach is used to determine two types of permeability for wind-tunnel steady-state <b>unidirectional</b> <b>airflow</b> through open-cell aluminum foam samples having different pore densities. ej 201...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Unidirectional</b> <b>airflow</b> {{cleanroom}} {{was designed}} to ideally control the flow in order to overcome airborne contamination problems, and that design has not changed much {{over the past twenty}} years. However, in reality, it didn’t work as expected. Thus, airborne contamination problems in semiconductor and flat panel display industries still existed even if entire fabrication was processed in unidirectional cleanrooms. Eventually, flow-based re-evaluation of existing unidirectional cleanroom design became inevitable. In this study, we performed fluid dynamics simulations of unidirectional cleanroom at various dimensions, and interpreted the results for further steps of cleanroom designs, such as, inlet/outlet ducts, perforated floors, and equipment arrangement. Furthermore, we developed the mathematical model that interprets the airflow inclination at various cleanroom dimensions into a unified representation to provide designers with concepts for flow-based integration of cleanroom layout. The predicted angle/location of the maximum flow inclination by our mathematical model in terms of fundamental design parameters agreed well with the computational fluid dynamics simulation results and with the expected trends...|$|E

40|$|The insect {{respiratory}} system {{is composed of}} a network of air-filled tracheal tubes that open to the atmosphere via spiracles along the lateral sides of the body. Trachea branch throughout the body and deliver oxygen directly to tissues. Insects control respiratory gas exchange patterns by modulating the opening and closing of the spiracle valves. The function of these respiratory patterns and the complete mechanism by which the spiracle valves are controlled is unknown. The work presented here investigates (1) the airflow patterns through the tracheal system, (2) the physiological contributors to respiratory pattern and possible spiracle control mechanisms, and (3) the adaptive significance of discontinuous gas exchange in insects. I used flow-through respirometry, video analyses of spiracle and abdominal movements, and hyperoxic tracer gases to determine if ventilating insects utilize tidal or <b>unidirectional</b> <b>airflow</b> in their {{respiratory system}}. I found that Gromphadorhina portentosa coordinates spiracular valve movements and abdominal contractions to produce <b>unidirectional</b> <b>airflow</b> through the tracheal system, with air entering through the thoracic spiracles and exiting through the posterior abdominal spiracles. Previous studies have determined that the respiratory pattern of insects is a function of metabolic rate. However, most studies of ectotherms utilize changes in ambient temperature to manipulate metabolic rate. I exposed Rhodnius prolixus to two metabolic stimuli, changes in ambient temperature or digestion of a blood meal, and measured components of their gas exchange pattern. I found that the volume of carbon dioxide released during a spiracle opening decreased with temperature, and that R. prolixus abandoned discontinuous gas exchange at a lower metabolic rate when metabolism was increased via increased ambient temperature compared to digestion. Lastly, I tested the longstanding “oxidative damage hypothesis” regarding the adaptive function of discontinuous gas exchange. I exposed Drosophila melanogaster to hypercapnic (6 % CO 2) gas treatments to prevent spiracular closure, and then measured the amount of oxidative damage (lipid peroxidation, protein carbonyl content, and superoxide dismutase activity) that accumulated in these populations versus a control group. I found that acute exposures (3 hours) of hypercapnia increased lipid peroxidation but had no effect on protein carbonyl formation or antioxidant enzyme activity. While results suggest that the discontinuous gas exchange pattern may not function to prevent excess oxidative damage, additional studies are required to investigate the chronic effects of disrupting this respiratory pattern...|$|E

In one stable, three of the five calves were experimentally infected with BHV 1 and later with BRSV. In the BVDV experiment, two calves persistently infected with BVDV (PI-calves) instead of experimentally infected calves, were used as the source of the virus. In all the calves infections were monitored using virus and antibody detection. Results showed that all the three viruses were transmitted by air. BHV 1 spread to sentinel calves in the adjacent stable within three days, and BRSV within nine days, and BVDV spread to sentinel calves probably within one week. Although airborne transmission is possibly not the main route of transmission, these findings will have consequences for disease prevention and regulations in control programmes.
