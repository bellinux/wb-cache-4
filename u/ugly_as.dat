500|$|Moynahan {{made her}} feature-film {{debut in the}} 2000 comedy-drama Coyote <b>Ugly</b> <b>as</b> Rachel, a bartender/dancer in a wild New York bar, a role that is {{considered}} Moynahan's breakthrough. She had accepted the role because she [...] "thought it was interesting that the whole movie revolved around five women…and my character was so strong and independent". The film garnered generally unfavorable critical reviews, but was a box-office success, earning $133million worldwide. Her next role was a supporting role in 2001 film Serendipity as Hally, the fiancée of John Cusack's character.|$|E
500|$|While South Carolina {{was known}} for legendary hard-knuckled {{political}} consultant Lee Atwater and rough elections, this had been more: Michael Graham, a native writer, radio host, and political operative, would say [...] "I have worked on hundreds of campaigns in South Carolina, and I've never seen anything as <b>ugly</b> <b>as</b> that campaign." [...] In subsequent years there would be persistent accounts trying to tie the anti-McCain smears {{to high levels of}} the Bush campaign: the 2003 book [...] would use it to build up their [...] "evil genius" [...] depiction of Bush chief strategist Karl Rove, while a 2008 PBS NOW program showed a local political consultant stating that Warren Tompkins, a Lee Atwater protégé and then Bush chief strategist for the state, was responsible. In contrast, in 2004 National Reviews Byron York would try to debunk many of the South Carolina smear reports as unfounded legend. [...] McCain's campaign manager said in 2004 they never found out where the smear attacks came from, while McCain himself never doubted their existence.|$|E

500|$|The song {{received}} generally positive reviews. Greg Kot of Chicago Tribune {{gave the}} song a positive review, {{calling it a}} [...] "club banger". Thomas Gonlianpoulous of Spin commended Swizz Beatz' [...] "bombastic production", Wayne's [...] "energetic yet nonsensical rap", and Brown's [...] "joyful, brisk vocals." [...] Dan Gennoe of Yahoo! Music UK said the song, serving as lead single, says [...] "Brown's promise {{for the future is}} to be an altogether more interesting kind of RB& artist." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly referred to the song as a [...] "swaggering" [...] lead single. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times referred to the song as a type that he has made his specialty, and called it an [...] "electric, brassy collaboration." [...] Although Nick Levine of Digital Spy called the song [...] "a brutal, tuneless hunk of industrial R - as musically <b>ugly</b> <b>as</b> something like 'With You' was pretty", he said [...] "for that matter, this track rocks", commenting [...] "Whatever you may think of him, you can't deny that Chris Brown lacks balls." [...] Jude Rogers of BBC Music said the song was catchy, but was one of the album's tracks that were a [...] "pale imitation of Justin Timberlake album tracks." ...|$|E
500|$|Many reviewers {{commented on}} the album's lyrical content. Gilbert Rodman of Popular Communications states, [...] "Eminem's music {{contains}} more than {{its fair share of}} misogynistic and homo-phobic lyrics, but simply to reduce it to these (as many critics do) doesn't help to explain Eminem. It merely invokes a platitude or a sound bite to explain him away." [...] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone enjoyed the record's comedic nature, writing [...] "Simply put: Eminem will crack you up", but also felt that the misogynistic lyrics grow tiresome, noting that [...] "the wife-killing jokes of [...] "97 Bonnie and Clyde' aren't any funnier than Garth Brooks', and 'My Fault' belongs on some sorry-ass Bloodhound Gang record." [...] Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club felt that although the album is [...] "sophomoric and uninspired" [...] at times, Eminem's [...] "surreal, ultraviolent, trailer-trash/post-gangsta-rap extremism is at least {{a breath of fresh air}} in a rap world that's despairingly low on new ideas." [...] Mike Rubin of Spin noted that [...] "his scenarios are so far-fetched the songs almost never sound as <b>ugly</b> <b>as</b> they actually are." [...] Chris Dafoe of The Globe and Mail opined that [...] "Abused by fellow students and teachers, cheated on by his girlfriend, despised by society, Shady goes over the top now and then - or rather way over the top - but Dre's lean production, full of strange voice and comic interjections, hold things together." ...|$|E

2500|$|The game {{started out}} <b>ugly,</b> <b>as</b> Pittsburgh quarterback Terry Bradshaw was picked off {{twice in the}} first quarter.

2500|$|The killings made {{headlines}} throughout the country. The Chicago Evening Post wrote, [...] "This {{is a crime}} of a Northern state, as black and <b>ugly</b> <b>as</b> any that has brought the South in disrepute.

[...] An article in the Minneapolis Journal accused the lynch mob of putting a [...] "stain on the name of Minnesota," [...] stating, [...] "The sudden flaming up of racial passion, which is the reproach of the South, may also occur, as we now learn in the bitterness of humiliation in Minnesota." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{series was}} chiefly {{inspired}} by the poem [...] "Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came" [...] by Robert Browning, whose full text {{was included in the}} final volume's appendix. In the preface to the revised 2003 edition of , King also identifies The Lord of the Rings, Arthurian Legend, and The Good, the Bad and the <b>Ugly</b> <b>as</b> inspirations. He identifies Clint Eastwood's [...] "Man with No Name" [...] character as one of the major inspirations for the protagonist, Roland Deschain. King's style of location names in the series, such as Mid-World, and his development of a unique language abstract to our own (High Speech), are also influenced by J. R. R. Tolkien's work.|$|E

2500|$|The Elijah {{of legend}} {{did not lose}} any {{of his ability to}} afflict the comfortable. The case of Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Simon ben Yohai is illustrative. Once, when walking a beach, he came upon a hideously ugly man—the prophet in disguise. The man greeted him courteously, [...] "Peace be with thee, Rabbi." [...] Instead of {{returning}} the greeting, the rabbi could not resist an insult, [...] "How ugly you are! Is there anyone as <b>ugly</b> <b>as</b> you in your town?" [...] Elijah responded with, [...] "I don’t know. Perhaps you should tell the Master Architect how ugly is this, His construction." [...] The rabbi realized his wrong and asked for pardon. But Elijah would not give it until the entire city had asked for forgiveness for the rabbi and the rabbi had promised to mend his ways.|$|E
2500|$|The Browns flew to McAfee Coliseum {{to take on}} the Oakland Raiders, {{still hoping}} for their first win of the year. [...] From the get-go, things {{immediately}} got <b>ugly,</b> <b>as</b> RB Reuben Droughns fumbled and LB Sam Williams picked up the ball for a 30-yard return touchdown. [...] In the second quarter, the Browns' woes continued, as QB Andrew Walter completed a 5-yard TD pass to WR Randy Moss. [...] Cleveland would get a 28-yard field goal by kicker Phil Dawson, but Oakland continued to pour on the hurt as RB LaMont Jordan ran 59 yards for a touchdown. [...] The Browns would get a touchdown before halftime, as QB Charlie Frye completed a 3-yard TD pass to TE Darnell Dinkins. [...] In the third quarter, Cleveland finally managed to click on all cylinders, as Frye completed two more TD passes to TE Kellen Winslow (a 2-yard pass) and WR Joe Jurevicius (a 5-yard pass) to take the lead.

The Good, the Bad and the Ugly {{has been described as}} European cinema's best representation of the Western genre film, and Quentin Tarantino has called it [...] "the best-directed film of all time" [...] and [...] "the greatest achievement in the history of cinema". This was reflected in his votes for the 2002 and 2012 Sight & Sound magazine polls, in which he voted for The Good, the Bad and the <b>Ugly</b> <b>as</b> his choice for the best film ever made.

2500|$|While {{the team}} was {{inspired}} by pop culture spy icons such as Jack Bauer and James Bond, the game was a [...] "Jason Bourne adventure" [...] with some over the top characters similar to those from Kill Bill. Many other games and films became the team's inspiration, including Deus Ex, System Shock 2, Fallout, Syriana, Ronin, and The Good, The Bad, and The <b>Ugly.</b> <b>As</b> the game is a spy-adventure, players can make choices that will affect the world's state. The morality in the game {{was designed to be}} ambiguous due to the game's real-world setting. Players can choose to spare or kill all the enemies featured in the game, with the player [...] "never really sure" [...] who their allies and enemies are. Thorton's responses to other non-playable characters also bring consequences and affect their perception of Thorton. The team ensured that no matter which moral paths players take, they will be rewarded as the team did not want to punish players for playing the game in a certain way. Michael Thorton was designed to be a everyman, as this allows players to choose their playstyle freely without having the need to conform to a particular style of play. To complement the spy theme of the game, the team added a timer to the dialogue system, which helps players to further immerse into the game and make intrinsic decisions. The dialogue stance system also meant that voice actors had to record the same lines using several different tones. The game's location was set across the globe as the team wants players to feel that Thorton is an [...] "international superspy".|$|E
