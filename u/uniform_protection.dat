30|$|The {{significant}} relationship between benefits and commitment in other fields was demonstrated in martial arts: benefits from martial arts <b>uniforms,</b> <b>protection</b> (β = . 30, p < . 0001), and benefits of martial arts (β = . 35, p < . 0001) strongly affected commitment to martial arts. Consistent with the previous studies (Ju et al. 2009; Kuo and Feng 2013), benefits played important roles in commitment to martial arts. Therefore, practitioners’ long term commitment to martial arts was decided by whether they enjoy martial arts and whether they are protected from injury.|$|R

50|$|Lack of <b>uniform</b> <b>protection</b> posed {{obstacles}} to safeguarding minority rights, despite improved police and judicial protection for minorities {{in some parts}} of the country. Ethnic quotas set for the recruitment of new officers into police academies were observed, but reforms intended to establish a countrywide effective, professional, multi-ethnic police force failed. Police forces as well as entity and local governments frequently allowed or encouraged an atmosphere in which violations of religious freedom could take place. In some cases the reluctance of police and prosecutors to aggressively investigate and prosecute crimes against religious minorities remained a major obstacle to safeguarding the rights of religious minorities. The appropriation of religious symbols and buildings for political purposes in combination with restrictions on religious services and ceremonies had a negative impact on inter-religious dialogue and inter-ethnic relations in many communities. Authorities of the majority religious or ethnic group often discriminated against those of the minority group in matters related to municipal services, including security and education.|$|E
50|$|The {{creation}} of a European community patent system, which {{would lead to a}} single unitary patent in the European Union (or its predecessor the European Community), has been debated since the 1970s. In 2012 agreement was reached between all European Union Member States except Italy and Spain on a European patent with unitary effect, more commonly known as the unitary patent, a proposed new type of patent that would be valid in participating member states of the European Union. Unitary effect can be registered for a European patent upon grant, replacing validation of the European patent in the individual countries concerned. The unitary effect means a single renewal fee, a single (group of) owner(s), a single object of property, and <b>uniform</b> <b>protection,</b> which means that revocation as well as infringement proceedings are to be decided for the unitary patent as a whole rather than for each country individually. Licensing is however to remain possible for individual countries.|$|E

40|$|To {{analyze the}} welfare gain from {{allowing}} for differentiated patent protection across sectors, this study develops a two-sector quality-ladder growth {{model in which}} patent breadth is a policy variable and derives optimal patent breadth under two patent regimes. We show that (a) uniform optimal patent breadth is a weighted average of sector-specific optimal patent breadth and (b) sector-specific optimal patent breadth is larger in the sector that has a larger market size and more technological opportunities. To derive the optimal policy, we allow for an arbitrary path of patent breadth and derive the optimal path by solving a Stackelberg differential game. We find that the optimal path of patent breadth under each patent regime is stationary, time-consistent and subgame perfect. Finally, we perform a numerical investigation and find that even a moderate degree of asymmetry across sectors can generate a significant welfare cost of <b>uniform</b> patent <b>protection.</b> Economic growth R&D <b>Uniform</b> patent <b>protection</b> Time-consistent patent policy...|$|R
40|$|After the Supreme Court’s {{decision}} in Shelby County v. Holder, voting rights activists proposed {{a variety of}} legislative responses. Some proposals sought to move beyond measures that targeted voting discrimination based on race or ethnicity. They instead sought to eliminate certain problematic practices that place too great a burden on voting generally. Responses like these are universalist, because rather than seeking to protect any particular group against discrimination, they formally provide <b>uniform</b> <b>protections</b> to everyone. As Bruce Ackerman shows, voting rights activists confronted a similar set of questions—and {{at least some of}} them opted for a universalist approach—during the campaign to eliminate the poll tax. Universalist responses have many possible strengths: tactically, in securing political support for and broader judicial implementation of laws that promote civil rights interests; substantively, in aggressively attacking the structures that lead to inequality; and expressively, in emphasizing human commonality across groups. But they have possible drawbacks along all three of these dimensions as well. Although scholars have addressed some of these strengths and drawbacks in the context of specific proposals for civil rights universalism, no work has attempted to examine these issues comprehensively. This essay attempts such an examination...|$|R
50|$|The {{report is}} {{historically}} important for having marked {{a shift in}} African countries’ economic policies towards economic liberalization. It details several policy recommendations in its plan for action, including “(1) more suitable trade and exchange-rate policies; (2) increased efficiency of resource use in the public sector; and (3) improvement in agriculture policies.” In terms of trade and exchange-rate policies, the report recommends liberalizations including “correction of overvalued exchange rates …; improved price incentives for exports and for agriculture; lower and more <b>uniform</b> <b>protection</b> for industry; and reduced use of direct controls.” For efficient resource usage, the Berg report identifies government and parastatal agencies as being overextended, and suggests streamlining public services, in part by allowing {{a greater share of}} these to be provided by the private sector. In the area of agriculture, they propose promoting export of cash crops by reducing taxes and other unfavorable terms of trade, as well as making domestic food markets more efficient by loosening regulation and increasing the role of the private sector in inputs (such as fertilizer) and in marketing foodstuffs (e.g. deregulating food prices). The report concludes with a strong appeal to international aid organizations to support African governments as they shift towards the policies of economic liberalization recommended by the World Bank.|$|E
5000|$|A {{compromise}} {{agreement on}} the seat(s) of the unified court was eventually reached at the June European Council (28-29 June 2012), splitting the central division according to technology between Paris (the main seat), London and Munich. However, on 2 July 2012, the European Parliament decided to postpone the vote following a move by the European Council to modify the arrangements previously approved by MEPs in negotiations with the European Council. The modification was considered controversial and included the deletion of three key articles (6-8) of the legislation, seeking to reduce the competence of the European Union Court of Justice in unitary patent litigation. On 9 July 2012, the Committee on Legal Affairs of the European Parliament debated the patent package following the decisions adopted by the General Council on 28-29 June 2012 in camera {{in the presence of}} MEP Bernhard Rapkay. A later press release by Rapkay quoted from a legal opinion submitted by the Legal Service of the European Parliament, which affirmed the concerns of MEPs to approve the decision of a recent EU summit to delete said articles as it [...] "nullifies central aspects of a substantive patent protection". A Europe-wide <b>uniform</b> <b>protection</b> of intellectual property would thus not exist with the consequence that the requirements of the corresponding EU treaty would not be met and that the European Court of Justice could therefore invalidate the legislation. By the end of 2012 a new compromise was reached between the European Parliament and the European Council, including a limited role for the European Court of Justice. The Unified Court will apply the Unified Patent Court Agreement, which is considered national patent law from an EU law point of view, but still is equal for each participant. the draft statutory instrument. The legislation for the enhanced co-operation mechanism was approved by the European Parliament on 11 December 2012 and the regulations were signed by the European Council and European Parliament officials on 17 December 2012.|$|E

Oviedo 3 is an example of an Integral Object-Oriented System (IOOS) based solely on the OO paradigm, developed over an OO Abstract Machine (OOAM) and OO Operating System (OOOS). When integrated with the object model of the abstract machine, capabilities gain new advantages such as automatic protection. Capabilities also allow more flexible security policies.

40|$|The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights {{negotiated}} in 1986 {{under the auspices}} of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the institutional predecessor of the World Trade Organization, incorporated substantial and <b>uniform</b> <b>protections</b> of intellectual property rights into the international trade system. A large body of contemporary academic literature suggests that intellectual property rights on socially valuable goods such as essential medicines give rise to a number of ethical problems. This review paper seeks to give an overview of these problems. Moreover, it offers an outline and discussion of a number of proposals as to how these problems might be alleviated. The paper is primarily descriptive in character. This means that although a personal perspective is sometimes offered, the primary ambition of the paper is not to argue for, and defend, a particular solution to the issues discussed. The aim is rather to highlight, explain and put into perspective a number of important arguments in the debate on the ethical nature of intellectual property rights so that policy-makers and other stakeholders are relatively well-equipped to make up their own mind on the issue.

40|$|In December 2010, public demonstrations erupted {{throughout}} the Middle East against autocratic regimes, igniting a regional political transformation {{known as the}} Arab Spring. Depending on events, modern international criminal and humanitarian law provided certain protections to vulnerable populations. However, international law did not provide a <b>uniform</b> degree of <b>protection</b> to civilians and combatants who faced similar circumstances. This Article argues for a <b>uniform</b> standard of <b>protections</b> for all populations affected by armed conflict, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. It evaluates each of five major Arab Spring uprisings (Tunisia, Bahrain, Egypt, Syria, and Libya) and describes the legal protections that applied in each country’s revolution or rebellion. We analyze the differences in protection, focusing on the distinction between international and non-international armed conflicts under current international law, which affords a significantly lower degree of protection during civil conflicts. Given the substantial number of non-international armed conflicts in the modern era, we argue for a <b>uniform</b> standard of <b>protections</b> for all armed conflicts. Next, the Article shows that current sovereignty trends are {{moving away from the}} concept of an absolute sovereign in favor of a responsible sovereign who adheres to international standards. This trend is incompatible with current international law, which provides a minimal level of protection during civil war, and could therefore shield sovereigns from liability for mass atrocity crimes. Finally, this Article offers solutions to appropriately minimize outdated sovereignty norms and eliminate unjustified distinctions in the international legal system using lessons from the Arab Spring...|$|R
