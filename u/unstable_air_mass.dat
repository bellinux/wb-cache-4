5|$|The Storm Prediction Center {{issued a}} {{moderate}} risk for severe weather across western Kansas and small portions of Oklahoma, Colorado and Nebraska for May 4, while temperatures {{were in the}} mid to high 80s°F (near 30°C). The atmosphere remained capped for much of the day, but storms began to develop in the late afternoon hours in western Oklahoma and the eastern Texas Panhandle. The most intense supercells developed in the early evening hours across northwestern Oklahoma and southwestern Kansas. They eventually produced 25 tornadoes, including the devastating Greensburg tornado and three other extremely large tornadoes which followed the Greensburg tornado late that evening. The supercells remained intact well into the overnight hours as the extremely <b>unstable</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> precluded rapid dissipation expected with the loss of daytime heating which would normally be expected in the Plains. The last tornado of the night did not lift until shortly after 2:00a.m. early on May 5.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of May 31, a strong cap was in place over much of central Oklahoma into eastern Oklahoma. With dewpoints {{creeping}} into the low 70s, the Storm Prediction Center early on considered upgrading part of the moderate risk forecast zone to a high risk forecast zone. As the day went on, there was no upgrade, but it became evident the atmosphere was ripe with CAPE values in excess of 4000 J/kg. With {{the presence of an}} extremely <b>unstable</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> over central Oklahoma, the Storm Prediction Center issued a Particularly Dangerous Situation Tornado Watch for much of the state during the afternoon of May 31 and lasting into the night. Later that evening, severe storms rapidly developed, and an extremely large and violent multiple-vortex tornado devastated areas near El Reno, Oklahoma, and killed eight people including three men from the storm chasing crew, TWISTEX. The tornado had been rated EF5 based on mobile radar readings, Other weak tornadoes and major flooding devastated parts of the Oklahoma City metro that evening. Further north, a powerful squall line of severe storms with several embedded strong tornadoes developed in Missouri. One of the tornadoes, a large and rain-wrapped EF3, caused major damage in several St. Louis suburbs. Weak tornadoes touched down in several other states.|$|E
2500|$|Finally, in {{any type}} of thunderstorms, the surface cold pool of air {{associated}} the downdraft will stabilize the air and form a cloud free area which will end along the gust front. This mesoscale front, when moving into a warm and <b>unstable</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass,</b> will lift it and cumulus clouds appear on satellite pictures. This line is likely the point of further convection and storms. One can notice it {{at the leading edge}} of a squall line, in the southeastern quadrant of a typical supercell (in the northern hemisphere), or different regions around other thunderstorms. They may also be visible as an outflow boundary hours or days after convection and can pinpoint areas of favored thunderstorm development, possible direction of movement, and even likelihood for tornadoes. The speed of forward movement of the outflow boundary or gust front to some degree modulates the likelihood of tornadoes and helps determine whether a storm will be enhanced by its presence or the inflow be choked off thus weakening and possibly killing the storm. [...] Thunderstorms may move along slow moving or stationary outflow boundaries and tornadoes are more likely; whereas fast moving gust fronts in many cases weaken thunderstorms after impact and are less likely to produce tornadoes—although brief tornadoes may occur at the time of impact. Fast moving gust fronts may eventually decelerate and become slow moving or stationary outflow boundaries with the characteristic [...] "agitated area" [...] of cumulus fields previously mentioned.|$|E

The same Winter weather occurs with less frequency and precipitation in Southern California, with the mountains' western faces and peaks causing an eastward rainshadow that produces the arid desert regions.|$|R

Several tornadoes were reported across the region, along with widespread moderate wind damage. The strongest tornado was rated EF2.|$|E
50|$|In general, {{cumulonimbus}} require moisture, an <b>unstable</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass,</b> and a {{lifting force}} (heat) {{in order to}} form. Cumulonimbus typically go through three stages: the developing stage, the mature stage (where the main cloud may reach supercell status in favorable conditions), and the dissipation stage. The average thunderstorm has a 24 km diameter. Depending on the conditions present in the atmosphere, these three stages take an average of 30 minutes to go through.|$|E
40|$|Excess {{rainfall}} in {{the summer}} 2011, risk phenomenon in Transylvania, highlight precipitation quantities that in the warm season become more abundant due to general circulation intensity of the atmosphere, {{as well as to}} the increasing role of thermal convection that develops in <b>unstable</b> <b>air</b> <b>masses,</b> which is also reflected in the amount of precipitation. In summer months, the most abundant rainfall falls due to thermal convection in most cases. Excess rainfall may be present in any season of the year. They are emphasized by the largest amounts of annually, monthly precipitation, by the absolute maximum amounts of precipitation in 24 hours, by the frequency of heavy rains and the days that exceed 10 l /m 2. We can say that the excess rainfall often lead to destruction and unimaginable damage...|$|R
40|$|Longitudinal {{aerodynamic}} performance {{comparisons between}} flight extracted and predicted values are presented {{for the first}} eight NASA Space Shuttle entry missions. Challenger results are correlated with the ensemble five flight Columbia experience and indicate effects due to differing angle-of-attack and body flap deflection profiles. An Appendix is attached showing the results of each flight using both the LaRC LAIRS and NOAA atmospheres.

40|$|A {{high-resolution}} transect {{of atmospheric}} soundings across the Kuroshio Current in the East China Sea was conducted onboard a ship in June 2012 {{with the objective}} of analyzing the influence of the complex sea surface temperature (SST) distribution on the Baiu frontal zone (BFZ). Expendable bathythermograph castings and continuous surface meteorological observations were also examined. Two distinct mesoscale atmospheric fronts, characterized by changes of wind direction in the lower troposphere and surface air temperature, were found in the BFZ. One (northern) atmospheric front was observed around the SST front in relation to a warm water tongue extending from the Kuroshio. A high SST region around the northern atmospheric front enhances unstable near surface stratification and intensifies turbulent heat flux. They help modify the marine atmospheric boundary layer in the BFZ. The other (southern) atmospheric front was {{at the southern end of}} the BFZ. Intense evaporation over the Kuroshio and moisture transport by southerly winds were important in forming the conditionally <b>unstable</b> <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> in the lower troposphere of the BFZ...|$|R
50|$|A very <b>unstable</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> was {{in place}} across the upper Midwest with a warm front draped from the Twin Cities area into west-central Wisconsin. A strong capping {{inversion}} suppressed thunderstorm development until near sunset, when a supercell thunderstorm developed {{in the western part}} of Hennepin County ahead of an advancing cold front near a surface low pressure center. The supercell would produce a tornado in Hennepin county before tracking eastward across the northern Twin Cities metro area and into Wisconsin where it produced two more tornadoes.|$|E
5000|$|A {{weak area}} of surface low {{pressure}} moved into extreme southeast North Dakota {{late on the}} afternoon of the June 17, with a warm front stretching across southeastern Minnesota. [...] The warm front combined with pre-existing moisture from morning rainfall which led to rapid destabilization of the atmosphere during the afternoon hours. To the east of the low pressure area, surface dew point values rose into the middle 60s °F (18 °C) with temperatures near 80 F, causing a very <b>unstable</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> to develop.|$|E
50|$|By late morning, the {{low cloud}} cover began to {{dissipate}} {{in advance of}} the dry line, but during the afternoon hours high cirrus clouds overspread the region, resulting in filtered sunshine in some areas that caused atmospheric destabilization. The sunshine and heating, combined with abundant low-level moisture, combined to produce a very <b>unstable</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass.</b> Upper air balloon soundings observed strong directional wind shear, cooling temperatures at high atmospheric levels, and the increased potential of CAPE values potentially exceeding 4000 J/kg, levels that are considered favorable for supercells and tornadoes.|$|E

40|$|The {{coastline}} generally represents {{it marked}} discontinuity in surface roughness. The resulting mechanical forcing {{leads to a}} secondary circulation in the boundary layer, and consequently to a vertical motion field that may have a strong influence on the weather in the coastal zone. In potentially <b>unstable</b> <b>air</b> <b>masses,</b> frictional convergence may cause a more-or-less stationary zone of heavy shower activity, for example. In this paper, we present a calculation of secondary flow patterns forced at a roughness discontinuity, {{as a function of}} the geostrophic wind. A neutral boundary layer is studied, with homogeneous conditions along the coastline (i. e., we study the circulation in a plane perpendicular to the coastline). The closure scheme for the turbulent mixing of momentum is based on a calculation of the eddy kinetic energy density (the 1, I' closure). The equations are solved on a grid stretched in both the vertical and horizontal directions, with largest resolution at the roughness discontinuity. Various relaxation techniques are combined to give an efficient calculation of the stationary flow fields. Upward motion turns out to be most pronounced when the geostrophic wind makes a small ( [...] - 20 °) angle with the coastline (in a clockwise direction), and not when the geostrophic wind is perpendicular to the coastline, as is sometimes mentioned. The asymmetry relative to the normal to the coastline is due to the Coriolis acceleration, and not a nonlinear effect. Nevertheless, nonlinear effects are important, because they create a tendency to frontogenesis in the case mentioned above. This is shown by a comparison of the linear and nonlinear solution. We finally present an example of heavy shower activity in the coastal zone of Belgium and The Netherlands, which is apparently due to frictional uplift and frontogenesis in a maritime polar <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> hitting the coastline at the critical angle referred to above...|$|R
40|$|The {{article of}} record as {{published}} may be located at [URL] cumulus cloud fields that develop in conditionally <b>unstable</b> <b>air</b> <b>masses,</b> {{only a fraction}} of the cumuli may eventually develop into deep convection. Identifying which of these convective clouds is most likely to generate lightning often starts with little more than a qualitative visual satellite analysis. The goal of this study is to identify the observed satellite infrared (IR) signatures associated with growing cumulus clouds prior to the first lightning strike, or lightning initiation (LI). This study quantifies the behavior of 10 Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite- 12 (GOES- 12) IR fields of interest in the 1 h in advance of LI. A total of 172 lightning-producing storms, which occurred during the 2009 convective season, are manually tracked and studied over four regions: northern Alabama, central Oklahoma, the Kennedy Space Center, and Washington, D. C. Four-dimensional and cloud-to-ground lightning array data provide a total cloud lightning picture (in-cloud, cloud-to-cloud, cloud-to-air, and cloud-to-ground) and thus precise LI points for each storm in both time and space. Statistical significance tests are conducted on observed trends for each of the 10 LI fields to determine the unique information each field provides in terms of behavior prior to LI. Eight out of 10 LI fields exhibited useful information at least 15 min in advance of LI, with 35 min being the average. Statistical tests on these eight fields are compared for separate large geographical areas. Median IR temperatures and 3. 9 -mm reflectance values are then determined for all 172 events as an outcome, which may be valuable when implementing a LI prediction algorithm into real-time satellite-based systems...|$|R
50|$|Convective lift {{can occur}} in an <b>{{unstable}}</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> well away from any fronts. However, very warm unstable air can also be present around fronts and low-pressure centers, often producing cumuliform and cumulonimbiform clouds in heavier and more active concentrations because of the combined frontal and convective lifting agents. As with non-frontal convective lift, increasing instability promotes upward vertical cloud growth and raises the potential for severe weather. On comparatively rare occasions, convective lift can be powerful enough to penetrate the tropopause and push the cloud top into the stratosphere.|$|E
5000|$|A {{separate}} system {{developed in the}} south-central US on January 20 in an <b>unstable</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass.</b> Numerous tornadoes were reported, with severe damage particularly around Waskom, Texas from an EF3 tornado where buildings were destroyed and people reported trapped but were not injured.

As many as 150 homes were damaged in Van Zandt County, Texas. [...] Fifty homes in Hopkins County, Texas has roof damage.|$|E
50|$|On {{this day}} an <b>unstable</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass,</b> {{coming from the}} Southwest (Atlantic), {{associated}} with a depression, with expression in {{the high levels of}} the troposphere and the core centered to the West of Lisbon, brought some unsettled weather to Portugal, in particular to the region of Algarve which was hit by most of the storm cells that were moving inland. Embedded in this instability, Mesoscale Convective Systems developed with associated tornado activity being registered. One major tornado which caused significant damage to people's houses and cars among other structures was registered to have passed through Carvoeiro, Lagoa and Silves.|$|E
50|$|The {{atmospheric}} circulation {{is controlled by}} the two semi-permanent South Atlantic and South Pacific highs, and a seasonal low pressure system east of the Andes (called the Chaco Low). During summer, the interaction between the South Atlantic high and the Chaco low causes the low pressure system to bring northeasterly and easterly winds that carry moisture to the region, particularly in the northern parts. The movement of moist air into the region during the summer results in very high precipitation. Most of the moisture comes from the east since the Andes block any moisture from the Pacific Ocean. Cold fronts that travel northwards to the region can produce precipitation during the summer months and is more prominent in the southern parts of the region. For example, in Tucuman Province, these cold fronts are responsible for 70% of the rainfall in that province. In contrast, during the winter months, the Chaco low attracts <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> from the South Pacific high, creating a dry and cold wind. This effect is more prominent in the winter months, when the intensity of the cold is more stronger. The Intertropical convergence zone reaches the region during the summer months, leading to low pressure, and <b>unstable</b> <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> due to the relatively high land temperatures compared to the sea during this season. This leads to enhanced precipitation in the form of convective thunderstorms during the summer months. During the winter months, the intertropical convergence zone moves northwards to Ecuador while both the South Pacific and South Atlantic high move northwards, and the Chaco low weakens, all of which result in the suppression of rain during the winter. With the predominant wind being from the west and the Andes blocking most rain bearing clouds from the Pacific Ocean along with {{atmospheric circulation}} patterns unfavourable for rain, this results in a dry season during winter. At the highest altitudes, westerly winds from the Pacific Ocean can penetrate during the winter months, leading to snowstorms.|$|R

50|$|Strong southwesterly winds transported a {{moist air}} mass northeastward across the Gulf Coast {{states and the}} Tennessee Valley.

50|$|The map on {{the left}} shows the {{meteorological}} situation at 1200 UTC of the morning of July 14, 1987 (0800 local). The cold front at the border between Ontario and Quebec is supported by an intensifying barometric trough at 500 mb, and a low pressure is developing at the surface, just southwest of Ottawa, Ontario. Cumulonimbus with high tops were easily forming in the moist, humid and <b>unstable</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> near the ground while drier air was cooling {{the air in the}} mid-tropospheric levels. A wind divergence at the upper level and a convergence near the surface, due to the low pressure, was helping to organize the deep convection.|$|E
5000|$|Warm air {{has a lower}} density than cool air, so {{warm air}} rises within cooler air, similar to hot air balloons. [...] Clouds form as {{relatively}} warmer air carrying moisture rises within cooler air. As the moist air rises, it cools, causing some of the water vapor in the rising packet of air to condense. [...] When the moisture condenses, it releases energy known as the latent heat of fusion, which allows the rising packet of air to cool less than its surrounding air, continuing the cloud's ascension. If enough instability {{is present in the}} atmosphere, this process will continue long enough for cumulonimbus clouds to form, which support lightning and thunder. Generally, thunderstorms require three conditions to form: moisture, an <b>unstable</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass,</b> and a lifting force (heat).|$|E
50|$|November 2005 {{was very}} active for tornadoes across the United States, with three large {{outbreaks}} and one additional significant tornado (see the List of tornadoes and tornado outbreaks).

However, by the start of the new year the pattern began to reverse itself, and moist, <b>unstable</b> <b>air</b> once again flowed northward from the Gulf of Mexico (a pattern normally reserved for spring) and combined with a series of strong low pressure systems tracking across the country, conditions were present for tornado formation.|$|R
5000|$|On June 8, 1984, a {{negatively}} tilted trough {{caused an}} extratropical {{low pressure area}} to form over {{the coast of the}} Socialist Republic of Romania (now non-Communist Romania). Surface moisture moved north from the Black Sea and caused nearby dew points to rise to 20 C; though at that time these were restricted to Romania and the Ukrainian SSR, dew points were higher than average elsewhere. By 1800 UTC, developing thunderstorms over the Ukrainian SSR spread overnight into the Russian SFSR. Between 00 and 12 UTC on June 9, the strengthening low pressure area moved north-northeast over the northwestern Russian SFSR before undergoing occlusion. In the meantime, a strong cold front rapidly advanced along a line extending south from the surface low, then south of Minsk in the Byelorussian SSR (now Belarus), to near Bucharest. This front separated the drier <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> to the north from the warm, moist <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> near the Black Sea, and strong wind speeds near ground level caused vertical mixing. Therefore, dew points actually dropped before the first tornadoes formed, but nevertheless several factors overcame the lower dew points to produce tornadoes. Among these were a strong upper-level jet stream, clear skies causing daytime heating and instability, strong synoptic-scale lifting leading to ascension of updrafts, and high adiabatic lapse rates promoting thunderstorm development. All these factors combined to produce severe weather near Moscow. The tornadoes occurred in this region because an <b>unstable</b> and moist <b>air</b> <b>mass,</b> supported by warm sea surface temperatures over the Black Sea, had been in place four days before the outbreak began. The unusually strong intensity of the trough in the region on June 8-9, with a 500-millibar geopotential height measured at about 2.7 standard deviations below normal, also favored an intense tornado outbreak.|$|R
50|$|In meteorology, {{convective}} instability or stability of an <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> refers to {{its ability to}} resist vertical motion. A stable atmosphere makes vertical movement difficult, and small vertical disturbances dampen out and disappear. In an <b>unstable</b> atmosphere, vertical <b>air</b> movements (such as in orographic lifting, where an <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> is displaced upwards as it is blown by wind up the rising slope of a mountain range) tend to become larger, resulting in turbulent airflow and convective activity. Instability can lead to significant turbulence, extensive vertical clouds, and severe weather such as thunderstorms.|$|R
50|$|The January 29-30, 2013 tornado {{outbreak}} was an early-season tornadic {{event that}} affected {{portions of the}} Midwestern United States and Southern United States. The first signs of the outbreak came on January 23 as the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) detailed the eastward progression of a shortwave trough into an increasingly <b>unstable</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> across portions of the lower Mississippi Valley; however, considerable uncertainty in the placement of severe thunderstorms caused the SPC to remove their threat outline. Succeeding many changes in the forecast, a Day 1 Moderate risk was issued for January 29, warning {{of the potential for}} widespread/significant damaging winds and a few strong tornadoes. The threat shifted eastward on January 30, encompassing a large section of the Southeastern United States. By late that day, the shortwave trough tracked northeastward into New England, ending the severe weather threat.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the eastern}} United States, the SPC {{warned of the}} threat of bow echoes {{producing}} damaging winds. An <b>unstable</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> was present across a significant amount of the Southeast, and warm air at the 850-millibar level indicated [...] "elevated mixed layer air". From southeastern Virginia into the mid-South, surface-level dew points were in the 70s° F. Parallel winds from low-to-mid levels combined with BRN shears predicted to around 30 indicated that bow echoes would be the primary threat. The most intense activity was expected to be confined to an area south and just north of a jet spanning from South Carolina to far-southeastern Virginia. Ahead of a mesoscale vorticity center entering western Georgia, the possibility of a second area of intense activity was noted for the southeastern part of the state coupled with far-northern parts of Florida.|$|E
50|$|The {{atmosphere}} {{began to}} destabilize {{due to a}} decrease in cloud cover over western and central Texas; the sunshine and heating, combined with sufficient wind shear and abundant low-level moisture, combined to produce a very <b>unstable</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass.</b> The SPC issued a severe thunderstorm watch from southern Oklahoma to central Texas that afternoon around 3:00 p.m. CDT. Supercells broke out in parts of northwestern Texas during the late afternoon hours, one of which developed the first tornado of the day at 5:38 p.m., near Belcherville in Montague County. A second tornado spawned by the same storm, rated as an EF1, touched down near Lake Amon G. Carter, damaging four homes and destroying one. As forecasters realized that conditions now favored tornadic activity, the SPC issued a tornado watch from far southern Oklahoma into central Texas at 6 p.m. CDT, replacing parts of the original severe thunderstorm watch.|$|E
