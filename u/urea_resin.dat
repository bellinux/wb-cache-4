40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study to elucidate the mechanisms of the flame spread over a filter paper permeated with an adhesive. For this study, two typical adhesives used for general purposes are adopted. One is polyvinyl acetate resin, and the other is <b>urea</b> <b>resin.</b> The flame spread rates and temperature profiles near leading flame edges were measured. Also, thermogravimetric analyses of the samples were performed. It was found that flame spread depends strongly on the pyrolysis reaction of the permeated adhesive. The highest pyrolysis temperature is of the pure filter paper, and the pyrolysis temperature decreases with the increase of either of permeated adhesives. Also, the flame spread rate decreases with the increase of the permeated adhesive. The decrease of the heat flux from the gas phase to the sample surface is inferred to be a main cause to decrease the flame spread rate with the increase of the amount of the permeated polyvinyl resin. For <b>urea</b> <b>resin,</b> establishment of a residual carbon layer is inferred to be a main cause of the flame spread rate reduction. Carbon-dioxide ejection during pyrolysis reaction, which is inferred through the thermogravimetric analyses, is supposed to enhance the flame spread rate reduction...|$|E

In this study, a series of N-doped microporous carbon materials were synthesized from low cost and widely available urea formaldehyde resin co-polymerized with furfuralcohol. These N-doped microporous carbons showed tunable surface area in the range of 416 – 2273  m 2  g− 1 with narrow pore size distribution within less than 1  nm and a high density of the basic N functional groups (2.93 – 13.92  %).

At 1  atm, N-doped carbons activated at 600  °C with KOH/UFFC weight ratio of 2 (UFFA- 2 - 600) showed the highest CO 2 uptake of 3.76 and 1.57  mmol g− 1 at 25 and 75  °C, respectively.|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] In {{order to}} predict the service life of plywood heating floors, {{dry-heat}} exposure test of lauan plywood made with each of six type of typical wood adhesives was carried out at 50 °, 70 °, 100 ° and 150 °C for 250 days.

Confidence limit was applied on the regression and the service life was calculated by extraporating the lower confidence limit curve to the half-strength. The apparent mechanism of dry-heat degradation of plywood in 1500 and 100 °C seemed to differ from the lower temperature exposures. On 70 ° and 50 °C, more conservative estimation was made by the kinetic method on the Arrhenius relationship.

30|$|The {{chemical}} compositions of the obtained {{samples are}} listed in Table  1, {{and it can be}} seen that higher nitrogen content was still retained even after activating under severe conditions. In contrast to UFA, the nitrogen content of the UFFA samples with furfuralcohol addition was decreased due to higher proportion of carbon source of the precursor. Interestingly, an increase in the nitrogen content is observed with the increase of the dosage of furfuralcohol, from 7.29 to 8.46  %. One possibility is that KOH prefers etching the fragments carbonized from furfuralcohol to that from <b>urea</b> <b>resin,</b> and the nitrogen atoms are protected during the activation process resulting from different surface charge densities [22]. What is noteworthy is that the insertion of O atoms into the framework occurs during the activation process resulting in the increase of the oxygen content. It is well known that the increase of the activation temperature or the dosage of KOH leads to the release of nitrogen in the form of molecular N 2, HCN, or other gases [28], which is responsible for the decreased of nitrogen content. However, the release of nitrogen reduces the affinity of the samples to CO 2 molecule and this can be confirmed by the CO 2 adsorption capacity and the isosteric heat of adsorption, which will be elaborated latter.|$|E

Boards of different specific gravities ranging from 0.55 to 0.75 were made by pressing shredded LP blended with <b>urea</b> <b>resin</b> having resin content of 6 %– 10 % at 180 °C. Subsequently, we also prepared mixed particleboard [wood (WD) particles and LP mixed], three-layered particleboard (LP as the middle layer, WD in the upper and lower layers), and wood particleboard all having resin content of 10 % and various specific gravities. Static bending and internal bonding strengths and thickness swelling of the specimens were determined to examine their properties. At the same specific gravity, the properties of LP particleboards were affected by their resin content. The modulus of rupture (MOR), modulus of elasticity (MOE), and internal bond strength of the LP particleboards increased with increasing specific gravity of the boards at the same resin content, but thickness swelling of the LP particleboards showed the reverse trend. The average MOR of the LP particleboards approximated that of the mixed particleboards and was greater than those of the three-layered particleboards and wood particleboards. Internal bond strength and thickness swelling of the LP particleboards were smaller than those of the other particleboards. Based on the above observations, we deemed that LP can be made into composite boards with adequate properties either alone or mixed with wood particles.|$|E
