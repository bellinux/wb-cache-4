5|$|Art {{director}} Jeremy Cook {{stated that}} maintaining readability and {{clarity of the}} <b>units</b> <b>and</b> combat space was highest priority of the game's art direction. He also {{wanted to make sure}} that the visual style remained consistent with the Halo universe, by ensuring that the recognisable traits of the <b>units</b> <b>and</b> structures were preserved. The Banished's art style was designed to contrast visually with the UNSC. Cook wanted the Banished to be reminiscent of the Covenant, but with a greater emphasis on the aesthetic of the Brute species. Brute vehicles and weapons featured in past Halo games helped influence the design changes and creation of new technology in the Banished's arsenal.|$|E

5|$|The psionic and technologically adept Protoss {{have access}} to {{powerful}} <b>units</b> <b>and</b> machinery and advanced technologies such as energy shields and localized warp capabilities, powered by their psionic traits. However, their forces have lengthy and expensive manufacturing processes, encouraging players to follow a strategy {{of the quality of}} their units over the quantity. The insectoid Zerg possess entirely organic <b>units</b> <b>and</b> structures, which can be produced quickly and at a far cheaper cost to resources, but are accordingly weaker, relying on sheer numbers and speed to overwhelm enemies. The humanoid Terrans provide a middle ground between the other two races, providing units that are versatile and flexible. They {{have access to}} a range of more ballistic military technologies and machinery, such as tanks and nuclear weapons.|$|E

The more the number of units is, the higher the accuracy of the model analysis is (take nine units in this paper).|$|R
