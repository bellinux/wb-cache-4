50|$|The {{commencement}} of <b>up-peak</b> may {{be triggered by}} a time clock, by the departure of {{a certain number of}} fully loaded cars leaving the lobby within a given time period, or by a switch manually operated by a building attendant.|$|E
5000|$|During <b>up-peak</b> mode (also called {{moderate}} incoming traffic), elevator cars in a {{group are}} recalled to the lobby to provide expeditious service to passengers arriving at the building, most typically in the morning as people arrive for work or {{at the conclusion of}} a lunch-time period. Elevators are dispatched one-by-one when they reach a pre-determined passenger load, or when they have had their doors opened for a certain period of time. The next elevator to be dispatched usually has its hall lantern or a [...] "this car leaving next" [...] sign illuminated to encourage passengers to make maximum use of the available elevator system capacity. Some elevator banks are programmed so that at least one car will always return to the lobby floor and park whenever it becomes free.|$|E

The traditional input mode of separate hall call registration and the destination selection is improved to a single-input mode. On this basis, dynamic partition method in <b>up-peak</b> traffic is studied. This method means dynamically adjust division of floor region based on flow rate {{and distribution of}} passenger. Dynamic programming algorithm is used to solve this problem. Through regroupment and classification for ensemble of hall call communication, prediction of multi-objective evaluation items is proposed. Fuzzy Neural Network is constructed and applied further to realize the optimal scheduling policy. Simulated {{results show that the}} presented elevator model is effective and the optimized scheduling algorithm has advantaged improvement for overall performance of elevator system.

40|$|In {{order to}} get a {{globally}} optimized solution for the Elevator Group Control System (EGCS) scheduling problem, an algorithm with an overall optimization function is needed. In this study, Real-time Particle Swarm Optimization (RPSO) is proposed to find an optimal solution to the EGCS scheduling problem. Different traffic patterns and controller mechanisms for EGCS are analyzed. This study focuses on <b>up-peak</b> traffic because of its critical importance to modern office buildings. Simulation results show that EGCS based on Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) using RPSO gives good results for <b>up-peak</b> EGCS scheduling problem. Besides, the elevator real-time scheduling and reallocation functions are realized based on RPSO in case new information is available or the elevator becomes busy because it is unavailable or full. This study contributes a new scheduling algorithm for EGCS, and expands the application of PSO...|$|E
40|$|In {{high-rise}} buildings, elevators must {{be safely}} and efficiently moving people during daytime. Generally, elevator <b>up-peak</b> traffic is predominant traffic between a lobby and various upper floors. Especially, the main expectation from elevators in buildings is increasing in a rush-hour time. Therefore, the passengerâ€™s waiting {{time in their}} floor are increased. We {{can say that the}} services given by the elevator group control system are not sufficient in this building. The passenger service level in an elevator system depends on the controlling of the elevators. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to demonstrate that an effective way to control of elevators group using optimization algorithms and the results show that the average journey and waiting time of passengers are decreased by means of suggested method...|$|E
40|$|Group {{elevator}} scheduling is an NP-hard sequential decision-making {{problem with}} unbounded state spaces and substantial uncertainty. Decision-theoretic reasoning plays a surprisingly limited role in fielded systems. A new opportunity for probabilistic methods has opened {{with the recent}} discovery of a tractable solution for the expected waiting times of all passengers in the building, marginalized over all possible passenger itineraries. Though commercially competitive, this solution does not contemplate future passengers. Yet in <b>up-peak</b> traffic, the effects of future passengers arriving at the lobby and entering elevator cars can dominate all waiting times. We develop a probabilistic model of how these arrivals affect the behavior of elevator cars at the lobby, and demonstrate how this model {{can be used to}} very significantly reduce the average waiting time of all passengers.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} passenger {{service in}} an elevator system during <b>up-peak.</b> There are several indicators describing elevator and passenger service, such as round-trip time and interval, passenger waiting time, ride time inside a car and journey time. Well-known equations for elevator round-trip times and mean passenger waiting times are referred to. The elevator service time at an entrance floor is the time interval between sequential elevator departures for upper floors. The time a passenger spends {{in an elevator}} traveling up to the destination floor {{is different from the}} elevator service time. It depends on the destination floor, the number of intermediate stops before the destination, and the passenger loading and unloading times. New equations for the passenger ride time inside the car and the total time a passenger spends in an elevator system (journey time) are deduced using transition probabilities between the floors. Theoretical results are compared with simulated results, and the validity of the theories is discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|Elevators {{are used}} in {{a large amount of}} {{buildings}} all over the world for fast and comfortable transportation. Today it is becoming increasingly important for people and products to be time efficient, and with technological development new solutions are created to answer this rising demand. To do this in an elevator context, elevator control strategies are implementedas optimal as possible. Machine learning is a relatively new concept, but it is already used in attempts to improve the performance of elevator control strategies. In this report the impact of machine learning on elevator control strategies is investigated in terms of average squared waiting times for the users. Machine learning algorithms can learn from both the current and past environments. The impacts of these two environments are also investigated. Three static elevator strategies and two versions of a machine learning elevator control strategy are implemented and run through a simulator. The results of the investigation show that machine learning has a significant impact on elevator control strategies and is proven to increase time efficiency with at least about 12. 5 %. Another conclusion drawn is that the current environment is most valuable in the user travel pattern down-peak, while information about previous days especially can improve the performance in the user travel pattern <b>up-peak...</b>|$|E
