5|$|On March 4, 1969 the FSU {{chapter of}} Students for a Democratic Society, an {{unregistered}} university student organization, sought to use university facilities for meetings. The FSU administration, under President Stanley Marshall, subsequently {{decided not to}} allow the SDS the use of university property and obtained a court injunction to bar the group. The result was a protest and mass arrest at bayonet point of some 58 students in an incident later called the Night of the Bayonets. The <b>university</b> <b>Faculty</b> Senate later criticized the administration's response as provoking as an artificial crisis. Another notable event occurred when FSU students massed in protest of student deaths at Kent State University causing classes to be canceled. Approximately 1000 students marched to the ROTC building where they were confronted by police armed with shotguns and carbines. Joining the all-night vigil, Governor Claude Kirk appeared unexpectedly with a wicker chair and spent hours, with little escort or fanfare, on Landis Green discussing politics with protesting students.|$|E
