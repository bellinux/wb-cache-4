30|$|Especially the {{demarcation}} line between pre-development and {{development is a}} delicate one, because some artefacts, especially requirement artefacts, seem to fit {{on either side of}} the line. Development includes a requirements process. Yet we classified some forms of requirements as belonging to the pre-development process, which are <b>market</b> <b>requirement,</b> product requirement and requirement in general. The organizations in our research were all SPOs and in this context <b>market</b> <b>requirements</b> are requirements as they are formulated by external stakeholders. Product <b>requirements</b> are <b>market</b> <b>requirements</b> which are adopted for inclusion in a future release of the software product. The term ‘requirement’ in general is in some cases used for <b>market</b> <b>requirement,</b> sometimes for product requirement or for both. We decided to categorize them as part of pre-development, since the involvement of an agile team in their formulation is limited, apart from some contribution by, mostly, a product owner. Also, requirements do still appear in (the requirement process within) development in the shape of epics and user stories.|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{evolution}} of the telecommunication industry, from both technology and market perspectives, is increasing at a rapid rate. At the forefront of this evolution are the telecommunication standards organisations and vendors. However, the {{evolution of}} the telecommunication standards is based on international norms formed by the <b>market</b> <b>requirements</b> of developed countries. The {{evolution of the}} telecommunication technology standards, as dominated by the developed countries, poses a definite challenge for emerging economies that hasn’t been effectively managed till date. Similarly, it is imperative for the South African telecommunication industry to align definite <b>market</b> <b>requirements</b> with the technology deployed in the service provider networks. The objective of this research paper is to address the effects and required alignment activities between technology evolution (in terms of South African network operator involvement in standardisation) and the actual South African telecommunication <b>market</b> <b>requirements.</b> The main contribution of this research paper is to highlight that the South African network operators should be actively involved in contributing to international telecommunication standards and establishing the required forums to address the concern of technology evolution for developing countries. This will consequently lead to the desired alignment between deployed technologies and <b>market</b> <b>requirements</b> in the telecommunication industry...|$|R

40|$|University {{technology}} commercialization {{has become}} an important topic of discussion in an era where the results of university research may create opportunities for new processes and products. Despite the government's allocation of research grants to universities in developing countries such as Malaysia, the level of technology commercialization is still low. While numerous factors contribute to the poor commercialization rate, the internal dynamics {{are one of the}} major driving factors. It is in this context that we analyze the influence of awareness of <b>market</b> <b>requirements</b> and intellectual property issues and collaboration on technology commercialization. Taking the researchers as the unit of analysis, while controlling for experience and other individual characteristics, we found that researchers' awareness of <b>market</b> <b>requirements,</b> intellectual property rights and university-industry collaborations {{play an important role in}} determining the success of university technology commercialization.

In order to achieve this aim, the study is previously focused on the clarification of the question to what extent fine artists will be educated in their studies at higher educational institutions on how to become successfully self-employed. The answer to this question is needed to outline the current mismatch between vocational education of fine artists and actual <b>market</b> <b>requirements.</b> A comprehensive and comparative analysis of Fine Art degree programmes and extra-curricular training offerings at higher educational institutions and arts incubation programmes in the UK and Germany was carried out. By using various key performance indicators this study shows evidence that fine artists will not be educated to successfully meet <b>market</b> <b>requirements</b> and that professional arts incubators should be a promising alternative or useful addition for fine artists' vocational preparation...|$|R
