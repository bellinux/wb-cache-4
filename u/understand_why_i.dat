[...] Hearing about this, the atheist Castro {{ironically}} replied: [...] "Now I <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> survived Bush's plans and the plans of other presidents who ordered my assassination: the good Lord protected me." [...] The quote {{was picked up}} on by the world's media.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked by}} TV Guide if he would've {{remained}} on General Hospital had the show's producers [...] "tried harder" [...] to accommodate his personal life, Burton stated: [...] "I don't {{want to point}} fingers. I {{know there are a}} lot of disappointed fans. They don't really understand what goes on behind the doors. They don't <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't go back to play Jason if I'm ready to work again. But what happens at GH should stay at GH." [...] Phelps dismissed rumors that she has [...] "lured" [...] Burton away from General Hospital. While clarifying rumors about him leaving General Hospital because of Phelps' appointment as executive producer of The Young and the Restless, Burton described them as [...] "interesting". He told On-Air On-Soaps that he knew people would try to put [...] "two and two together", but it was never his intention to leave General Hospital purposely, as he just couldn't reach a contractual agreement with the show. [...] "Itâ€™s just like a sports player...when a deal does not work out with his team, there might be another team out there that might want him," [...] Burton said. During the week Burton debuted on the series as Dylan, the show experienced an increase of over 105,000 viewers, averaging 4.7 million viewers. Michael Fairman, during an interview with Burton, noted the [...] "significant increase" [...] in viewers, which Burton was a [...] "big reason" [...] for.|$|E
500|$|Tricky {{explained}} Maxinquayes {{title in}} an interview with Simon Reynolds: [...] "Quaye, that's this race of people in Africa, and 'Maxin,' that's my mum's name, Maxine, and I've just taken the E off"; Reynolds interpreted this as a [...] "place name" [...] similar to the Rastafarian idea of Zion. In another source, Tricky was reported as saying Quaye had also been his mother's surname. According to Greg Kot, his mother's name provided the album its title while her suicide, along with his father abandoning him and Tricky's lack of moral sense as a youth, helped inform his [...] "unsentimental grasp on reality", which was reflected in Maxinquayes [...] "collision of beauty and violence". In the opinion of Stylus Magazines Kenan Hebert, who called it [...] "a document of obsession, mistrust, misconduct, solipsism, and sociopathy", the songs dealing with dysfunctional sexual relationships and fear of intimacy were given a Freudian angle by his mother's influence on the album, including Tricky's reference to her on [...] "Aftermath". In an interview for The Wire, Tricky explained his mother's influence and his use of female vocalists like Topley-Bird: [...] "My first lyric ever on a song was 'your eyes resemble mine, you'll see as no others can'. I didn't have any kids then... so what am I talking about? Who am I talking about? My mother... used to write poetry but in her time she couldn't have done anything with that, there wasn't any opportunity. It's almost like she killed herself to give me the opportunity, my lyrics. I can never <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> write as a female, I think I've got my mum's talent, I'm her vehicle. So I need a woman to sing that." ...|$|E

5000|$|According to the {{magazine}} Films in Review, Hatfield was ambivalent about having played Dorian Gray, feeling that it had typecast him. [...] "You know, I was never a great beauty in Gray ... and <b>I</b> never <b>understood</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> got the part and have spent my career regretting it", he {{is reported to have}} said.|$|R

In tasting a few of my comforts he <b>understood</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> loved the great city. He saw me also in an established position, and this he considered a gain. His faith in my future was now complete.|$|R
500|$|On the {{recommendation}} of Cabranes, Sotomayor was hired {{out of law school}} as an assistant district attorney under New York County District Attorney Robert Morgenthau starting in 1979. [...] She said at the time that she did so with conflicted emotions: [...] "There was a tremendous amount of pressure from my community, from the third world community, at Yale. They could not <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> was taking this job. I'm not sure I've ever resolved that problem." [...] It was a time of crisis-level crime rates and drug problems in New York, Morgenthau's staff was overburdened with cases, and like other rookie prosecutors, Sotomayor was initially fearful of appearing before judges in court. [...] Working in the trial division, she handled heavy caseloads as she prosecuted everything from shoplifting and prostitution to robberies, assaults, and murders. She also worked on cases involving police brutality. She was not afraid to venture into tough neighborhoods or endure squalid conditions in order to interview witnesses. [...] In the courtroom, she was effective at cross examination and at simplifying a case in ways to which a jury could relate. [...] In 1983 in her highest profile case she helped convict the [...] "Tarzan Murderer" [...] (who acrobatically entered apartments, robbed them, and shot residents for no reason). [...] She felt lower-level crimes were largely products of socioeconomic environment and poverty, but she had a different attitude about serious felonies: [...] "No matter how liberal I am, I'm still outraged by crimes of violence. Regardless of whether I can sympathize with the causes that lead these individuals to do these crimes, the effects are outrageous." [...] Hispanic-on-Hispanic crime was of particular concern to her: [...] "The saddest crimes for me were the ones that my own people committed against each other." [...] In general, she showed a passion for bringing law and order to the streets of New York, displaying special zeal in pursuing child pornography cases, unusual for the time. [...] She worked 15-hour days and gained a reputation for being driven and for her preparedness and fairness. [...] One of her job evaluations labelled her a [...] "potential superstar". Morgenthau later described her as [...] "smart, hard-working, [...] a lot of common sense," [...] and as a [...] "fearless and effective prosecutor." [...] She stayed a typical length of time in the post and had a common reaction to the job: [...] "After a while, you forget there are decent, law-abiding people in life." ...|$|E

2500|$|Press {{photographer}} Peter Molloy, {{who arrived}} at the scene after the first explosion, came close to being shot by an angry paratrooper who saw him taking photographs {{of the dead and}} dying instead of offering to help the wounded. The soldier was tackled by his comrades. Molloy said, [...] "I was shouted at and called all sorts of things but <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>why.</b> <b>I</b> had trespassed on the worst day of these fellas' lives and taken pictures of it." ...|$|R
2500|$|The [...] "historical induction" [...] {{argument}} {{concludes that}} since most theistic religions throughout history (e.g. ancient Egyptian religion, ancient Greek religion) and their gods ultimately {{come to be}} regarded as untrue or incorrect, all theistic religions, including contemporary ones, are therefore most likely untrue/incorrect by induction. It is implied as part of Stephen F. Roberts' popular quotation: I contend that we are both atheists. I just believe in one fewer god than you do. When you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods, you will <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> dismiss yours.|$|E
2500|$|Cork manager Conor Counihan {{expressed}} his feelings {{in the press}} room: [...] "Relief, {{at the end of}} the day. It's fantastic for the lads, each and every one of them. I spoke to them and we have 30 good guys here, but there are a lot of guys down the years who for one reason or another we had to move on from and those guys are part of this. And the last 20 years, we were landed with a fantastic group of players. They made it hard for themselves, but that makes it all the sweeter". Cork captain Graham Canty also {{expressed his}} feelings at a press conference: [...] "Ah. It feels all right now. It is humbling being captain of this bunch of players. I don't <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> am in here, just because I am captain". Canty offered his sympathies to Down captain Benny Coulter for the loss he had suffered.|$|E

60|$|He {{would have}} made short work of my present difficulty, I feel certain. It was ridiculously simple. But I had lost my head, and had ceased for the moment to be a {{reasoning}} creature. In the end, indeed, it was no presence of mind but pure good luck which saved me.
