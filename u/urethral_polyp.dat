Although the exact incidence is unknown, they are important in the differential diagnosis of lower urethral obstruction in male children.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} the investigation of the influence of ureaplasmal infection on the development of <b>urethral</b> meatus <b>polyps</b> in women. The article presents the results of the examination of women with chronic cystitis and urethritis over a 0. 5 - to 5 -year duration, complicated by the presence of <b>urethral</b> meatus <b>polyps</b> and associated with concomitant Ureaplasma urealyticum and other sexually transmitted infections (STI). This was based on the culture analysis of the cervical and urethral content, and PCR-diagnostics of STI, as well as a complex pathomorphologic study of the resected polyps, including electron microscopy. In this study, 98 women between 45 and 60 years (52. 5 ± 4. 9 years) were examined, who had undergone radiowave resection of the polyps: 52 women were infected by STI, including Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma hominis, Chlamydia trachomatis and Trichomonas vaginalis, while the remaining 46 women had been diagnosed as not having STI. According to the culture results in the women with STI, U. urealyticum was identified as a monoinfection in 69 % of cases, while in the remaining 31 % of cases it was evident in the form of mixed infections, mainly in association with Mycoplasma hominis (17. 5 %) and Trichomonas vaginalis (13. 5 %). Pathomorphological examination of the <b>urethral</b> meatus <b>polyps</b> of the women with U. urealyticum and other STI demonstrated the proliferative character of the remodeling of the surface epithelium with hyperplasia, acanthosis, and keratinization of the stratified squamous epithelium and synchronous changes in the underlying connective tissue - impaired microcirculation and the diffuse inflammatory cell infiltrates with transepithelial leukopedesis. Using electron microscopy in the fibroblasts and plasma cells of the resected polyps the markers of U. urealyticum were detected in patients with negative results of the bacteriological diagnostic methods...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Urethral polyps are a rare {{finding in}} children. Urethral fibroepithelial polyps are usually {{discovered}} {{in the first decade}} of life. They present with voiding dysfunction, obstructive and irritative urinary symptoms, and hematuria. They may be associated with other congenital urinary tract anomalies. Histopathologically, they are usually benign lesions with no tendency to recurrence and are treated by surgical ablation, fulguration or laser therapy. Diagnosis is made by sonography, voiding cystourethogram and cystoscopy. In this report, a rare case of posterior <b>urethral</b> <b>polyp</b> in an eight –year old male child is presented.

Materials and Methods: The anomalies considered in the current review were anterior urethral valve, lacuna magna, syringocele, Cobb's collar, duplication of urethra, megalourethra, and prostatic <b>urethral</b> <b>polyps.</b> The literature was extensively reviewed concerning the presentations, diagnosis, different types of treatment modalities, morbidity, mortality, and new concepts for the above disorders. Result: Anterior urethral valves or diverticula are the most prevalent congenital anomalies of anterior urethra. The lacuna magna is the largest depression in the dorsal aspect of the fossa navicularis. It is demonstrable on a well-performed voiding cystourethrography of the distal urethra. The dilated Cowper's gland duct is the other missed diagnosed anomaly of the urethra in boys. The congenital narrowing of the bulbar urethra with a variable clinical presentation and obstruction grade and different types of anterior urethral obstruction are the most common presentation of these anomalies. However, other symptoms or signs including, hematuria, bloody spotting on underwear, discomfort or sever pain {{in the vicinity of the}} glance, interrupted voiding, infection, bulging of anterior urethra, enuresis, and postvoiding dribbling are the only nonspecific manifestations of these disorders. Conclusion: All of these disorders are demonstrable on a well-performed voiding cystourethrography of the distal urethra. The urologist must be aware about these uncommon congenital anomalies and the anterior urethra should be carefully evaluated for such anomalies. Diagnosis of these entities is elusive unless the physician is looking for them. Nonspecific symptoms mentioned here besides radiographic findings can be a valuable clue for diagnosis. </p...|$|R

In the pathogenesis, it is charcterized by increased fibroblast proliferation with activation of immunological mechanisms and accumulation of collagen {{in the skin}} and internal organs. Patients might have anesthesia-related potential problems because many systems affected and have functional disorders due to accumulation of collagen. For this reason, anesthetic management is extremely important. A careful preoperative evaluation is essential.

40|$|Most of {{the recent}} {{investigations}} of the lower urinary tract have been concentrated on the ureterovesical junction. Studies of 120 children examined by the method of voiding cinecystography and urethrography revealed that vesicoureteral reflux occurred in 22 cases without evidence of a lesion of the urethra, and in six children secondary to lesions of the urethra. Thirteen of the children studied had isolated lesions of the urethra. Urethral lesions encountered in this series of children included stenosis of the external meatus (14 cases), urethral valve (one case), <b>urethral</b> <b>polyp</b> (one case) and urethral stricture (two cases). The main advantages of cinefluorography and television control in this field lie {{in the fact that}} all phases of the voiding act can be observed and, when necessary, recorded on a movie film.

40|$|A 38 -year-old man was {{admitted}} to our hospital complaining of difficult, frequent urination to our hospital. Transrectal echography and digital examination showed chronic prostatitis. He was treated with medication for chronic prostatitis but his condition did not improve. Retrograde urethrography revealed an obstructive change in the prostatic urethra and urethroscopic findings showed a urethral tumor in the posterior urethra. Transurethral resection of the tumor was performed. Pathological diagnosis of the urethral tumor indicated a urethral caruncle. After one year, the patient was readmitted to our hospital with the same complaints as before. Urethroscopic findings revealed the recurrence of a <b>urethral</b> <b>polyp</b> in the posterior urethra. Transurethral resection of the polyp was performed. Pathological findings revealed that the inner structure of the polyp showed a prostatic glandular pattern that after staining with anti-prostatic acid phosphatase antibody. The final diagnosis was that the polyp had a prostatic-type epithelium in the prostatic urethra...|$|E
