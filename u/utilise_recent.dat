40|$|Lee (2012) {{proposes that}} {{personality}} research should <b>utilise</b> <b>recent</b> theories of causality. Although {{we agree that}} such theories are important, we also note that their empirical application has not been very successful to date. The {{reason may be that}} psychological systems are frequently characterised by feedback, nonlinearity and individual differences in causal structure. Such features do not preclude the application of causal modelling but do limit the usefulness of the approach for the analysis of typical personality data.

We <b>utilise</b> <b>recent</b> developments on threshold cointegration approach to investigate if asymmetric dynamic adjusting processes exist among rapeseed oil, sunflower oil, soybean oil and diesel prices. The {{results suggest that the}} two-regime threshold cointegration model exist only in favour of rapeseed oil-diesel price pair. Therefore, this vegetable oil price adjusts rapidly to its long run equilibrium, determined by fossil diesel prices, in an asymmetric manner when the divergence between the two prices is above a critical threshold. Consequently, rapeseed oil seems to be particularly exposed to exogenous shocks deriving from global political scenarios, suggesting to redefine the high quota (80 %) of EU biodiesel produced by this vegetable oil through a sustainable development of international trade...|$|E

Women are faced with numerous decisions in relation to breast cancer including: actions they can take to reduce their risk of developing breast cancer; whether to participate in screening programs; and selection of the most appropriate treatment option if diagnosed with breast cancer. This paper discusses ways in which theories and findings from two disciplines, behavioural science and marketing, can be used collaboratively to design effective communications to increase the uptake of health behaviours that have the potential of reducing morbidity and mortality from breast cancer. From marketing we borrow the concepts of audience segmentation, media selection, and mass communication message design.

We conclude that the gas surrounding massive early-type galaxies was shock heated as it fell into collapsing dark matter halos so that L_X,Gas is primarily driven by the depth of a galaxy's potential well.

It particularly presents a dynamic bandwidth management scheme, enabling the wireless LAN to efficiently support asynchronous data transfer services characterised by burst mode traffic. For the evaluation of the bandwidth management scheme, the paper proposes an analytic traffic model with adaptive service rate for each system queue and solves it based on a number of logical assumptions.

Pioneering studies, which <b>utilise</b> <b>recent</b> living corals from Tarawa (1 oN, 172 oE) and Maiana (1 oN, 173 oE), in the western equatorial Pacific Ocean, indicate that coral oxygen isotope (δ 18 O) records from this region can be used to reflect variations in ENSO-related climate patterns (Cole et al. 1993; Urban et al. 2000). The δ 18 O signal, however, is a combination of both changes in sea surface temperature (SST) and in the δ 18 O of seawater (δ 18 Osw), yet both these factors may change with ENSO variations. This study investigates the coral-derived climate signals of the past 50 years (~ 1960 to 2010) from Butaritari Atoll (~ 172 o 30 ’E, 3 o 30 ’N) located in the western central equatorial Pacific using paired Sr/Ca and δ 18 O proxies to separate the SST and δ 18 Osw signals.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{substantial}} recent interest in captured design expertise expressed as design patterns. Prevalent descriptions of these design patterns suffer from two demerits. Firstly, they capture specific instances of pattern deployment, {{rather than the}} essential pattern itself, thus {{the spirit of the}} pattern is often lost in the superfluous details of the specific instances described. Secondly, existing pattern descriptions rely upon relatively informal diagrammatic notations supplemented with natural language annotations. This can result in imprecision and ambiguity. This paper addresses these problems by separating the specification of patterns into three models (role, type, and class). The most abstract (role-centric) model presents patterns in their purest form, capturing their essential spirit without deleterious detail. A role-model is refined by a type-model (adding usuallydomain-specific constraints), which is further refined by a class-model (forming a concrete deployment). We <b>utilise</b> <b>recent</b> advances in visual modelling notation to achieve greater precision without resorting to obtuse mathematical symbols. A set-oriented view of state, operations, and instances is adopted, permitting their abstract presentation in models via this visual notation. This paper utilises these ideas in the unambiguous specification of a selection of prominent design patterns. The expectation is that precise visual pattern specification will firstly enable clear communication between domain experts and pattern writers (and ultimately pattern users), and secondly enable CASE tool support for design patterns, permitting the designer (pattern user) to operate at a higher level of abstraction without ambiguity...|$|E

We find that through the great business cycle boom of the early 2000 s, both countries followed expansionary monetary policy. This is consistent with the idea that de facto exchange rate pegging induces a loss of monetary policy autonomy. By following expansionary monetary policy at a time of buoyant business cycle conditions, in both countries, monetary policy contributed to exacerbating instability of GDP; it helped exacerbate both boom and bust. Capital flows and conditions on currency markets changed profoundly from late 2007 onwards. Hence, this paper is primarily focused on the period from 1998 till 2007, the period where both countries were trying to use monetary policy to obtain exchange rate undervaluation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Several {{agencies}} recommend seafood to {{be consumed}} 2 - 3 times per week. In Australia, {{there is a lack}} of nutrient composition data for seafood species and it is not known whether including different seafood species in a diet would provide sufficient long-chain omega 3 fatty acids (LC n- 3 PUFA) to meet various national recommendations. OBJECTIVE: To <b>utilise</b> <b>recent</b> nutrient composition data for major Australian seafood groups (n= 24) with the addition of two tuna options (total n= 26) to: (1) determine whether including these species into a diet based on the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating (AGHE) will achieve LC n- 3 PUFA recommendations [Adequate Intake (AI: 160 mg/d men, 90 mg/d women) ], Suggested Dietary Target (SDT), 500 mg/d Heart Foundation (HF) recommendation and (2) determine the weekly number of servings of seafood to meet recommendations using either lower fat (n= 23, < 10 % total fat) or higher fat (n= 3, ≥ 10 % total fat) seafood. DESIGN: Two simulation models incorporated all 26 species of seafood or only lower fat seafood into a diet based on the AGHE. Two further models identified the number of servings of lower or higher fat seafood required to meet recommendations. RESULTS: Including 2 and 3 servings/week of any seafood would enable 89 % of women and 66 % of men to meet the AI. Including only lower fat seafood would enable 83 % of women and 47 % of men to meet the AI. Half a serving/week of higher fat seafood would enable 100 % of men and women to meet the AI. CONCLUSIONS: Including the recommended 2 - 3 servings of seafood/week requires at least some higher fat seafood {{to be consumed}} in order for most men and women to meet the AI. Further messages and nutrition resources are needed which provide options on how to increase intake of LC n- 3 PUFA, specifically through consumption of the higher fat seafood...|$|E

Behavioural response studies (BRSs) aim to establish {{a relationship between the}} exposure dose of a stressor and associated behavioural responses of animals. A recent series of BRSs have focused on the effects of naval sonar on cetaceans. Here we review the current state of understanding of the impact of sonar on marine mammals and highlight knowledge gaps and future research priorities. 2. Many marine mammal species exhibit responses to naval sonar. However, responses are highly variable between and within individuals, species and populations, highlighting the importance of context in modulating dose-response relationships. 3. There is increasing support for the risk-disturbance hypothesis as an underlying response mechanism. This hypothesis proposes that sonar sounds may be perceived by animals as a threat, evoking an evolved anti-predator response. An understanding of responses within both the dose-response and risk-disturbance frameworks may enhance our ability to predict responsiveness for unstudied species and populations. 4. Many observed behavioural responses are energetically costly, but the way in which these responses may lead to long-term individual and population level impacts is poorly understood. Synthesis and Applications Behavioural response studies have greatly enhanced our understanding of the potential effects of navy sonar on marine mammals. Despite data gaps, we believe a dose-response approach within a risk-disturbance framework will enhance our ability to predict responsiveness for unstudied species and populations. We advocate for (1) regulatory frameworks to <b>utilise</b> <b>recent</b> peer-reviewed research findings when making predictions of impact (where feasible within assessment cycles), (2) regulatory frameworks to account for the inherent uncertainty in predictions of impact, and (3) investment in monitoring programmes that are both directed by recent research and offer opportunities for validation of predictions at the individual and population level.

40|$|This work {{describes}} the surface initiated atom transfer radical polymerisation (SI-ATRP) of liquid crystalline monomers from cellulose fibres (paper) to yield side-chain liquid crystal polymers (SCLCPs) {{attached to the}} surface of cellulose (paper) biofibres, <b>utilising</b> <b>recent</b> developments in ATRP chemistry. Developments in ATRP have been utilised to provide robust conditions for the grafting. SCLCP grafts with varied mesogenic units have been achieved. A new mixing protocol has been developed to allow for the polymerisations in the presence of homogenous substrates. Covalent attachment has been confirmed for both smectic and nematic SCLCPs to cellulose, with graft-from polymerisations evidenced for both types of mesogenic units. All graftings were confirmed by FT-IR, with special attention given to the carbonyl peak at ∼ 1730 cm- 1. The cellulose surfaces were characterised by Scanning Electron Microscopy and Polarising Optical Microscopy (POM). Sacrificial initiator was used to monitor the extent of surface grafting, and characterisation of the sacrificial polymers produced was carried out by gel permeation chromatography, 1 H NMR and POM...|$|R
40|$|To {{avoid the}} {{solution}} of numerous Kohn-Sham one-body potential equations for wave functions in density functional theory, various groups independently proposed the use of Pauli potential to bosonise the customary one-body potential theory. Here, we <b>utilise</b> our <b>recent</b> quantum Monte Carlo calculations of the ground-state electron density of the Be atom to estimate the bosonised one-body potential V-B(r) and hence extract the Pauli potential for this atom...|$|R
