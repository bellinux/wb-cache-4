40|$|The {{issue of}} {{geographic}} equity {{has been one}} of the greatest concerns throughout the history of the CDM. To encourage wider implementation of the CDM or a reformed CDM and new market-based mechanisms in the future, it is necessary to identify the barriers that hinder implementation of CDM projects in <b>underrepresented</b> <b>countries.</b> This paper quantitatively analyzes the relative significance of barriers to implementing CDM projects in Indonesia. Using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), the results revealed that the barriers related to financing, the carbon market, and international CDM policies and rules are the three major categories of barriers. Barriers that are primarily related to domestic factors, except financing barriers, turned out to be relatively less significant. Over the past several years, substantial resources have been devoted to capacity building activities. However, our results indicate that we should at least carefully reexamine how to distribute our resources among various barriers in the future...|$|R

50|$|The major {{producers}} of eucheuma algae include the Philippines (~92% total global production; 2005 statistics FAO) and China (~7% total global production), including Tanzania and Kiribati. This may be <b>underrepresented</b> as <b>countries</b> including Indonesia and Malaysia, {{which are also}} significant {{producers of}} these species, do not accurately report their output to the FAO. As eucheuma is commercially important for economic growth, average annual production of total dried seaweeds, including other groups of sea plants, reached nearly 125,000 tonnes in the Philippines alone, by 2000-2004, with a value of approximately $US139 million.|$|R

40|$|Financial {{support for}} Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) {{projects}} in <b>underrepresented</b> host <b>countries</b> was agreed {{on at the}} Copenhagen conference. The EU rules include special import quotas for Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) from Least Developed Countries (LDCs). This paper discusses whether these measures can contribute to overcoming barriers to CDM development in LDCs, how Programmes of Activities (PoAs) are performing, and how CDM projects and PoAs contribute to sustainable development in LDCs. CER supply and demand scenarios for 2013 - 2020 show that preferential access measures for LDCs would not have an important impact on CDM in these countries if the barriers for project implementation are not overcome. The specific CDM projects and PoAs found in LDCs yield potentially high sustainable development benefits. Through a comparison between the climate regime and the Lomé Convention, a preferential access agreement in agricultural trade, we conclude that not just preferential access is important, but also reduced access costs {{and the removal of}} underlying barriers. Increased incentives for added-value products characterise the Lomé success stories. For the climate regime, this could be translated into additional financial incentives for CDM projects with added value. As LDCs host a high share of them, PoAs could constitute an opportunity here...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the extent to which older people are used as models in television advertisements in Korea and Malaysia, representing an aged and ageing nation, respectively. The paper examines the roles and functions played by older people in advertisements that portray these older people as models; and the social context, setting and tone of advertisements. Television advertisements from major television channels in Korea and Malaysia were recorded during prime time. These recordings were coded by two experts in each country. Data were analyzed using content analysis. The findings show that older people are underrepresented compared to their proportion in both countries. Older males are overly represented while older females are <b>underrepresented,</b> in both <b>countries.</b> Overall, older people were portrayed in a positive way even though they tended to play minor roles. However, regardless of gender, they are invarably cast as information receivers rather than senders...|$|R
40|$|Although {{some studies}} point to {{cognitive}} stimulation as a beneficial therapy {{for older adults}} with cognitive impairments, this area of research and practice is still lacking dissemination and is <b>underrepresented</b> in many <b>countries.</b> Moreover, the comparative effects of different intervention durations remain to be established and, besides cognitive effects, pragmatic parameters, such as cost-effectiveness and experiential relevance to participants, are seldom explored. In this work, we present a randomized con- trolled wait-list trial evaluating 2 different intervention durations (standard 1 ⁄ 4 17 vs brief 1 ⁄ 4 11 sessions) of a cognitive stimulation program developed for older adults with cognitive impairments with or without dementia. 20 participants {{were randomly assigned to}} the standard duration intervention program (17 sessions, 1. 5 months) or to a wait-list group. At postintervention of the standard intervention group, the wait-list group crossed over to receive the brief intervention program (11 sessions, 1 month). Changes in neuropsychological, functionality, quality of life, and caregiver outcomes were evaluated. Experience during intervention and costs and feasibility were also evaluated. The current cognitive stimulation programs (ie, standard and brief) showed high values of experiential relevance for both intervention durations. High adherence, completion rates, and reasonable costs were found for both formats. Further studies are needed to definitively establish the potential efficacy, optimal duration, cost-effectiveness, and experiential relevance for participants of cognitive intervention approaches.

40|$|This {{comparative}} study examines {{trends in the}} representation of the environment in Malaysian and New Zealand newspapers over an eight year period. By comparing the two media contexts, it explored the role of journalism’s occupational norms, of the relationship between journalists and sources and of media ownership in determining the quality of news coverage of the environment. The sample was made up of eight mainstream newspapers which were selected based on biggest circulation figures, sampled in 1996, 2000 and 2004. The four Malaysian newspapers, all nationally distributed, were the English-language papers The New Straits Times and The Star, and the Malay-language papers Berita Harian and Utusan Malaysia. The four New Zealand newspapers, all regionally distributed, were The Press, The Dominion Post, The New Zealand Herald and The Otago Daily Times. The study employed content analysis as the prime method to observe trends in environmental news; while in-depth interviews with 40 respondents were used to verify from subjects’ experiences the various forces that might cause the trends. Major content analysis findings were that environmental news is <b>underrepresented</b> in both <b>countries</b> and that the news patterns in the two countries are quite similar. The study raised questions {{about the quality of the}} news, with much of the coverage being conflict-framed, one-source event stories, with high dependency on government officials. These problems were less acute in New Zealand. Trends were largely stable across the three years. The most significant change in Malaysian coverage was an increase in the use of the public and scientists as sources over time. Interviews revealed some differences between New Zealand and Malaysia in journalists’ awareness of organizational determinants of news, editorial policies towards the environment, sources criticisms of journalists’ laziness, but also many common problems, including journalists’ lack of knowledge about environmental issues and science. In Malaysia, government control of the news and editors’ self-censorship of sensitive news was identified as a problem. The study concludes that newspapers in both countries do not operate as information providers or educators, but most of the time are reactive towards environmental issues...|$|R
40|$|The project {{provides}} an overview of China’s current natural gas imports and key factors impacting its future imports. As part of its strategy to pursue cleaner energy sources, the Chinese government has pledged to consume more natural gas, which has historically been <b>underrepresented</b> in the <b>country’s</b> energy mix. To achieve its natural gas consumption goal, China’s demand for imported natural gas is expected to reach 124 billion cubic meters in 2020, more than tripling its imports in 2012 of 38 billion cubic meters. Cheap and abundant gas in the U. S., {{as a result of the}} shale gas revolution, has generated enormous interest in China about the possibility of importing LNG from the U. S. However, uncertainties surrounding U. S. natural gas export policies reinforced China’s impression that importing gas from the U. S. may be a difficult and prolonged process. Several studies predict that the future influx of gas from the U. S. into the international market will lead to a decline in natural gas prices worldwide. As a result, even if China does not import LNG from the U. S., it is likely to benefit from the decrease in LNG prices in the global market. The mere possibility of importing gas from the U. S. has given China more leverage in its negotiations with Russia over the China-Russia gas pipeline. Given the recent progress the two countries have made in their negotiations, it is expected that Russia and China will finalize the gas pipeline agreement by the end of 2014. By 2020, the pipeline is expected to deliver 68 billion cubic meters of gas annually from Russia to China, meeting more than half of China’s total demand for imported gas. A secured supply of pipeline gas from Russia may depress China’s appetite for LNG imports from additional sources including the U. S. In addition, China’s domestic factors – including the gas tariff mechanism and regulations on import rights and infrastructure – will impact its future LNG imports. The current state-mandated gas tariff mechanism in China has led to losses of gas importing companies, since the mandated gas prices are not sufficient to cover the costs of imported gas. High barriers for any non-state capital to enter the gas-importing sector have further hindered efficient investments made along the LNG import value chain. Favorable regulatory reforms will incentivize Chinese companies, in particular non-state enterprises, to pursue cheaper natural gas supplies overseas, thereby increasing China’s competitiveness as a gas importer in the international market...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} competitiveness {{in the global economy}} nations around the world are heavily investing in access to higher education and more specifically the production of skilled workers in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). Whereas upper social-class majority males have traditionally dominated this field, the expansion of university enrollments as well as the presence of rapidly growing minority populations signals a shift in which a larger number of minorities and women will add to the STEM talent pool. To date, much of the research on underrepresented minorities in STEM has focused on women and underrepresented racial and ethnic minorities in universities in the U. S. (Espinoza & Cole, 2008; Museus et al., 2011; St. John & Musoba, 2011). Few studies have focused on the persistence and academic achievement of <b>underrepresented</b> minorities in <b>countries</b> and institutions outside of the Unites States and none have specifically targeted minority students who are beneficiaries of affirmative action policies. The current study seeks to explore factors that affect the academic performance and persistence of quota students majoring in STEM fields in a public university in Brazil. The major research questions guiding this study were: (1) In what ways do institutional factors affect quota student persistence and academic performance in STEM fields? (2) To what extent does campus climate affect the academic performance of quota students in STEM fields? (3) What barriers (major academic, social, and financial concerns) do quota students in STEM fields face after admission and how do student and faculty perceptions of these barriers differ? (4) What institutional services are available to support quota STEM students and which of these services do STEM students use most frequently? Using qualitative methods and an ethnographic case study design, semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten undergraduate quota students, two graduate students, and six university personnel. In addition, the researcher observed students on campus, {{both in and out of}} class. Additional observations were made of location students frequented such as the residence hall, library, campus restaurants, and the physics, chemistry, and engineering buildings. Findings revealed four broad themes: pre-college experiences, college experiences, college outcomes, and barriers to graduation and institutional responses. Participants indicated that their pre-college academic experiences had the largest effect on their academic achievement and persistence. Quota students in STEM disciplines routinely reported having failed their core math and science courses during the first year and experiencing difficulty with others as they matriculate. This was largely attributed to the fact that they entered with a lack of a strong academic base. Additional barriers students faced were lack of finances, and a lack of family support and cultural capital. While the university has implemented various financial supports to address quota students’ needs, they lack structured academic supports such as bridge programs, supplemental instruction, and tutoring...|$|R
