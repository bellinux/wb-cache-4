40|$|Abstract — We present HNOCS (Heterogeneous Network-on-Chip Simulator), an {{open-source}} NoC simulator {{based on}} OMNeT++. To {{the best of}} our knowledge, HNOCS is the first simulator to support modeling of heterogeneous NoCs with variable link capacities and number of VCs per <b>unidirectional</b> <b>port.</b> The HNOCS simulation platform provides an open-source, modular, scalable, extendible and fully parameterizable framework for modeling NoCs. It includes three types of NoC routers: synchronous, synchronous virtual output queue (VoQ) and asynchronous. HNOCS provides a rich set of statistical measurements at the flit and packet levels: end-to-end latencies, throughput, VC acquisition latencies, transfer latencies, etc. We describe the architecture, structure, available models and the features that make HNOCS suitable for advanced NoC exploration. We also evaluate several case studies which cannot be evaluated with any other exiting NoC simulator. Keywords-NoC simulator; Heterogeneous NoC I...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} four port three input-dc-dc boost {{converter}} for hybridising two photovoltaic systems and a storage medium. Three <b>unidirectional</b> <b>ports</b> are utilised to interface the converter {{with the two}} input sources and the output load. A bidirectional port interfaces the converter with the storage system. The two sources individually or simultaneously supply the load and charge the battery. The proposed technique employs only four independently controlled switches with different duty ratios. The regulated dc output {{can be obtained by}} controlling these four switches and tracking the maximum power of the two photovoltaic systems. Three different modes of operation of converter influenced by the state of battery are presented. The proposed system is validated and verified by simulation performed in MATLAB under various operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to propose a multi-input power converter for the hybrid system that interfaces two <b>unidirectional</b> <b>ports</b> for input power sources, a bidirectional port for a storage element, and a port for output load in a unified structure. The two input ports for simultaneously converting two different input power sources with low voltages to a stable output power with a high voltage. According to various situations, the operational states of the proposed converter can be divided into three states based on battery utilization. In order to ensure that the system operates with high efficiency, this paper proposes a power management control scheme, which controls the bidirectional converter operating under boost mode according to the operation condition of the PV/Fuel Cell, so that the battery can be charged or discharged.

50|$|The Tandy 1000 RL/RLX/RSX series were slim-line desktop home computers. The RL and RL/HD {{featured}} a 9.56 MHz 8086 processor (surface-mounted, so no V30 upgrade was possible), 512 KB of RAM (expandable to 768 KB to provide 128 KB for video and 640 KB conventional memory), smaller keyboard and mouse ports (which {{were similar to}} the PS/2's ports but not 100% compatible), a DB-25 <b>unidirectional</b> parallel <b>port</b> instead of the edge-connector ports, and the SL's enhanced graphics and sound. A single half-size 8-bit expansion slot was available. Both the RL and RL/HD included a built-in XT IDE hard drive interface and the RL/HD came with a 20MB drive preinstalled. The RL/HD had a battery-backed real-time clock chip to store date and time information, which the RL lacked. These models also had MS-DOS and a portion of DeskMate in ROM, and could therefore boot much faster than many other computers on the market.|$|R

40|$|Abstract-This paper {{presents}} a new extendable single-stage multi-input dc–dc/ac boost converter. The proposed structure comprises of two bidirectional ports in the converter’s central part to interface output load and battery storage, and several <b>unidirectional</b> input <b>ports</b> to get powers from different input dc sources. In fact, the proposed topology {{consists of two}} sets of parallel dc– dc boost converters, which are actively controlled to produce two independent output voltage components. Choosing two pure dc or two dc-biased sinusoidal values as the converter reference voltages, situations of the converter operating in two dc–dc and dc–ac modes are provided, respectively. The proposed converter utilizes minimum number of power switches {{and is able to}} step up the low-level input dc voltages into a high-level output dc or ac voltage without needing any output filter. The converter control system includes several current regulator loops for input dc sources and two voltage regulator loops for generating the desired output voltage components, resulting in autonomously charging/discharging the battery to balance the power flow. Due to the converter inherent multi-input multioutput control system, the small signal model of the converter is extracted and then the pole-placement control strategy via integral state feedback is applied for achieving the converter control laws. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed converter and its control performance are verified by simulation and experimental results.
