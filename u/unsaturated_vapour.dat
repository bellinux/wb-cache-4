40|$|AbstractComplexes with {{acetylacetone}} Sc(acac) 3, dipivaloylmethane Sc(thd) 3, 2, 2, 6, 6 –tetramethyl- 4 -fluoro- 3, 5 -heptanedione Sc(tfhd) 3, pivaloyltrifluoroacetone Sc(ptac) 3, trifluoroacetylacetone Sc(tfac) 3, and hexafluoroacetylacetone Sc(hfac) 3 were synthesized, purified {{and identified}} by elemental analysis, m. p., IR and NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. The thermal behaviour of the synthesized compounds in the solid state was {{investigated by the}} method of difference-scanning calorimetry in vacuum. As a result the thermodynamic characteristics of the melting processes were determined. The temperature dependences of saturated and <b>unsaturated</b> <b>vapour</b> pressure of complexes under study were measured by static method with membrane-gauge manometers. The average molecular weight of gas calculated from the experimental data on unsaturated vapours using ideal gas law {{was close to the}} molecular weight of monomer for all investigated compounds. Decomposition temperatures of compounds under study were defined as the temperature above that pressure changes became irreversible. The information about melting and decomposition processes were taken into account at measuring saturated vapour pressure of complexes. The row of volatility Sc(hfac) 3 > Sc(ptac) 3 > Sc(tfac) 3 > Sc(thd) 3 ≥ Sc(tfhd) 3 > Sc(acac) 3 was determined from the p–T dependences obtained. Above information about thermal behaviour of complexes enabled one {{to use it as a}} guide for CVD experiments aimed at achieving oxide films with high optical properties. Precursor chosen for film deposition was Sc(thd) 3 The Sc 2 O 3 film deposition conditions were following: the gas-carrier rate 1 l/h, He gas-reagent rate 10 l/h, total pressure 10 Torr, evaporator temperature 105 - 110 ̊С, substrate temperature 450 - 650 ̊С, substrate Si(100). Ellipsometry was applied to characterize the film thickness and refractive index. The morphology and the composition of the films were determined with XPS and SEM...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A new curing method, {{chemical}} vapour curing (CVC) for polycarbosilane (PCS) fibers using <b>unsaturated</b> hydrocarbon (cyclohexene) <b>vapour</b> was studied. The low {{oxygen content}} SiC fibers were prepared {{and when the}} oxygen content in fibers was lower than 4. 0 %, the maximum tensile strength reached to 3. 8 GPa. The relationship between the tensile strength and the oxygen content of the fibers was investigated. The structure and composition of SiC fibers were also characterized by element analysis, FT-IR, XRD and XPS. Compared with that by air curing method, SiC fibers with less oxygen and better mechanical properties were prepared by CVC method...|$|R
40|$|Of {{prevalent}} {{conceptions of}} the physics of fog formation, the “classical ” theory of the mixing of air maases of different temperatures seems to the present author {{to be the most}} convincing. In {{view of the fact that}} turbulent exchange implies a mixing of eddies of different origins, it is clear that the theory of turbulence applied to saturated air should result in some basic ideas of fog formation. For simplification of the problem to be studied, the author assumes that the inertia of the drops of fog can be neglected and that they are transferred by eddies in the same way as vapour. On that assumption, the mixing ratio of the total weter content, i. e. the mixing ratio of liquid water plus vapour, and the potential wet-bulb temperature are two elements of air that remain constant in eddies irrespective of whether these are saturated or <b>unsaturated</b> by <b>vapour.</b> By putting each of the elements into the differential equation of eddy exchange, the basic formulae for estimation of fog density are obtained. The boundary conditions of integration determine the alternative kinds of fog, for example advection fog and radiation fog. Finally, some important modifications are obtained if regard is paid t...|$|R
40|$|Simulation of an {{evaporation}} test in a soil column {{have been}} carried out to characterize the properties of the topsoil of the El Cabril Radioactive Waste Disposal Facility and the evaporation process. The conceptual model considers <b>unsaturated</b> liquid flow, <b>vapour</b> flows and heat flows of a sample of 14 cm. of the vegetal soil. Vapour fluxes become the main water flow mechanism under very dry condition. Water leaves the column as vapour only {{at the top of the}} column, due to the difference of relative humidity and temperature between the column and the laboratory. Very dry conditions necessitate the modification of the retention curve to represent oven dry condition and it has been calculated considering the experimental values obtained by CIEMAT (Villar et al. 2012). The model has been calibrated with the experimental data obtaining the values of the parameters of the constitutive laws and of the boundary conditions, suggesting that it can be used to assess the behavior of the soil under evaporation conditions. Finally, an abnormal behavior of the sample during the test has been displayed due to a bigger value of β...|$|R
40|$|Canopy {{effect in}} this paper refers to the {{phenomenon}} whereby moisture accumulates underneath an impervious cover. Field observations reveal that the canopy effect can occur in relatively dry soils where the groundwater table is deep {{and can lead to}} full saturation of the soil immediately underneath the impervious cover. However, numerical analysis based on existing theories of heat and mass transfer in unsaturated soils can only reproduce a minor amount of moisture accumulation caused by an impervious cover, particularly when the groundwater table is relatively deep. In an attempt to explain the observed canopy effect in the field, this paper proposes a new mechanism of moisture accumulation in <b>unsaturated</b> freezing soils: <b>vapour</b> transfer in such a soil is accelerated by the process of vapour–ice desublimation. A new approach for modelling moisture and heat movements is proposed in which phase changes during the evaporation, condensation and desublimation of vapour flow are considered. A laboratory device is designed specifically to study <b>vapour</b> transfer in <b>unsaturated</b> freezing soils. The test results reveal that vapour transfer can lead to significant moisture and ice accumulation near the freezing end of a soil specimen. The computed results show that the proposed model can indeed reproduce the unusual moisture accumulation observed in relatively dry soils. The results also demonstrate that soil freezing fed by vapour transfer can result in a water content that is close to full saturation. Because vapour transfer is seldom considered in geotechnical design, the canopy effect deserves greater attention during construction and earth works in cold and arid regions...|$|R
40|$|Prediction of {{contaminant}} transport {{in concrete}} subjected to short cyclical wetting and drying processes is integrally bound to prediction of the moisture flux. The concrete is unsaturated and the non-linear contaminant and moisture fluxes are not described by simple constant diffusion methods. This thesis presents, and partially justifies, a thermodynamic model for prediction of moisture movement in concrete, at all moisture contents commonly encountered. The wetting process is examined with Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) images during a simple absorption (sorptivity) experiment. Diffusivity functions are derived via a novel analytical approach and a universal diffusivity is suggested. Water sorption and desorption isotherms are measured on large concrete samples. van Genuchtens retention function is successfully used {{to model the}} results. The unrelia-bility of the water sorption method at high moisture contents is illustrated by comparison with Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry (MIP). The BJH method is exploited to provide a methodology for estimating the water sorption isotherm from MIP. Mualems conductivity model is assessed with the water retention and NMR results. This thorough validation of the model yields a tortuosity parameter that is different to that commonly assumed. An analytical relationship between the sorptivity and the saturated permeability suggests the experimental the long-term unsaturated permeability overesti-mates the unsaturated conductivity function, and as such should be used judiciously when predicting unsaturated flow processes. Mualems conductivity model is further exploited to provide <b>unsaturated</b> air and <b>vapour</b> functions that are experimentally justified. The thermodynamic description of water movement and the hydraulic functions that are developed in the thesis are incorporated into T r inCet, a transient heat and mass trans-fer model based on the Finite Element Method (FEM). The complex coupled behaviour of air, liquid, vapour and temperature are well handled {{under a variety of}} common cyclical boundary conditions. The thesis presents all necessary experimental results required for validation of a com-plex, but easily described, model for moisture movement. It covers disparate ground to provide a powerful numerical model of unsaturated moisture movement in concrete under short-term cyclical processes...|$|R
