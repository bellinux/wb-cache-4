25|$|A {{forceful}} man, {{he was one}} of {{the principal}} administrators behind the successful push for Sri Lanka's admission to Test status. However, he could be difficult, and he made enemies as well as admirers. He was behind the appointment of two of the selectors for Ceylon's first-ever tour of England in 1968. The government was already reluctant to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> to support the two-month tour, and when Fuard's two selectors chose themselves and Fuard in the touring team and omitted some prominent players, the resultant uproar among the cricket fraternity led the government to cancel the tour.|$|E
500|$|When Shannon is eight, {{her father}} marries Sabrina Carlyle (Lindsay Frost), and she {{spends much of}} her {{adolescence}} with her stepbrother Boone. She studies ballet and, as she gets older, teaches dance classes to young girls. When she is eighteen, Shannon's father dies in a car crash. He {{did not have a}} will prepared, so all of his money and property goes to his wife. Sabrina refuses to help Shannon financially, despite Shannon winning a prestigious yet non-paying internship to the Martha Graham Dance Company in New York. Unable to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> herself, Shannon moves to France for a short time to work as an au pair. Shannon later forms a plan to con her stepbrother, Boone Carlyle, into giving her some of the inheritance she rightly deserved. Playing on her knowledge of Boone's love for her, she makes it appear her boyfriend Brian abuses her. Boone pays Brian to leave her, and Shannon plans to secretly take half the money. During one con in Sydney, her [...] "abusive boyfriend" [...] ruins Shannon's ruse after Boone cuts him a check. Boone storms off to his hotel room and plans to return to the States. When Shannon's boyfriend takes off with all of the money, Shannon goes to Boone's hotel room in Sydney, drunk, and Boone allows her to seduce him. After they have sex, Shannon tells Boone things will go back to the way they had been before. He expresses anger because, as always, they both know she is in control of their situation/ relationship. The following morning at the Sydney airport, Sayid Jarrah approaches Shannon, asking her to watch his bag for him. She deftly obliges, but soon leaves it unattended. Before the doomed Flight 815 takes off, Shannon rummages through her hand-luggage for her asthma inhaler, which Boone casually hands to her. She smiles, the platonic love she has for Boone briefly relieving her of her misery. Six hours into the flight, only moments before the crash, Shannon and Boone are momentarily seen as Charlie Pace stumbles through their row.|$|E
