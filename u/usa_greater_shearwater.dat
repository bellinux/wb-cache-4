5000|$|The <b>great</b> <b>shearwater</b> (Ardenna gravis; {{formerly}} Puffinus gravis) {{is a large}} shearwater in the seabird family Procellariidae. Ardenna {{was first}} {{used to refer to}} a seabird by Italian naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi in 1603, and gravis is Latin for [...] "heavy".|$|R
50|$|This shearwater is {{identifiable}} by its size, at 45 - 56 cm {{in length}} and with a 112 - 126 cm wingspan. It has brownish-grey upperparts, white underparts and a yellowish bill. It lacks the brown belly patch, dark shoulder markings and black cap of the <b>great</b> <b>shearwater.</b>|$|R

Beached Northern Fulmars, <b>Great</b> <b>Shearwaters,</b> Sooty Shearwaters and Cory’s Shearwaters are found on Sable Island, Nova Scotia, Canada regularly, {{and they can be}} used to assess plastic pollution. All species except Cory’s Shearwaters contained plastic debris in their gastrointestinal tracts. Northern Fulmars, Sooty <b>Shearwaters</b> and <b>Great</b> <b>Shearwaters</b> all showed high prevalence of plastic ingestion (> 72 %), with Northern Fulmars having the highest number and mass of plastics among the species examined. There was no difference in plastic ingestion between sexes or age classes.

50|$|It {{appears to}} be {{particularly}} {{closely related to the}} <b>great</b> <b>shearwater</b> (A. gravis) and the short-tailed shearwater, all blunt-tailed, black-billed species, but its precise relationships are obscure. In any case, these three species are among the larger species of shearwater that have been moved into a separate genus Ardenna based on a phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA.|$|R
50|$|The <b>great</b> <b>shearwater</b> {{feeds on}} fish and squid, which it catches {{from the surface}} or by plunge-diving. It readily follows fishing boats, where it indulges in noisy squabbles. This is a gregarious species, which {{can be seen in}} large numbers from ships or {{appropriate}} headlands. They have a piercing eeyah cry usually given when resting in groups on the water.|$|R
50|$|This species {{appears to}} be related to the sooty <b>shearwater</b> and the <b>great</b> <b>shearwater,</b> which are also blunt-tailed, black-billed species, but its precise {{relationships}} are obscure (Austin, 1996; Austin et al., 2004). These are among the larger species of shearwater, which have been moved to a separate genus, Ardenna based on a phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA (Penhallurick & Wink, 2004).|$|R
50|$|The {{inshore waters}} around the {{headland}} are busy with shipping of all sizes. There is a Coastwatch {{station on the}} headland in the former coastguard building.

40|$|International audienceBackground: Among {{the most}} {{widespread}} seabirds in the world, shearwaters of the genus Puffinus are also some of the deepest diving members of the Procellariiformes. Maximum diving depths are known for several Puffinus species, but dive depths or diving behaviour have never been recorded for <b>great</b> <b>shearwaters</b> (P. gravis), the largest member of this genus. This study reports the first high sampling rate (2 s) of depth and diving behaviour for Puffinus shearwaters. Methodology/Principle Findings: Time-depth recorders (TDRs) were deployed on two female <b>great</b> <b>shearwaters</b> nesting on Inaccessible Island in the South Atlantic Ocean, recording 10 consecutive days of diving activity. Remote sensing imagery and movement patterns of 8 males tracked by satellite telemetry {{over the same period}} were used to identify probable foraging areas used by TDR-equipped females. The deepest and longest dive was to 18. 9 m and lasted 40 s, but most (> 50 %) dives were < 2 m deep. Diving was most frequent near dawn and dusk, with < 0. 5 % of dives occurring at night. The two individuals foraged in contrasting oceanographic conditions, one in cold (8 to 10 °C) water of the Sub-Antarctic Front, likely 1000 km south of the breeding colony, and the other in warmer (10 to 16 °C) water of the Sub-tropical Frontal Zone, at the same latitude as the colony, possibly on the Patagonian Shelf, 4000 km away. The cold water bird spent fewer days commuting, conducted four times as many dives as the warm water bird, dived deeper on average, and had a greater proportion of bottom time during dives. Conclusions/Significance: General patterns of diving activity were consistent with those of other shearwaters foraging in cold and warm water habitats. <b>Great</b> <b>shearwaters</b> are likely adapted to forage {{in a wide range of}} oceanographic conditions, foraging mostly with shallow dives but capable of deep diving...|$|R
40|$|Primary, {{tail and}} body moult of three seabirds from Tristan da Cunha {{archipelago}} were studied by castnetting offshore south Brazil from February 2006 to August 2007. Timing, duration and synchronization of primary and tail moult are described {{relative to the}} annual calendar. Body moult overlapped breeding in Atlantic yellow-nosed albatrosses (Thalassarche chlororhynchos), but tail and primary moult did not. Spectacled petrels (Procellaria conspicillata) had protracted body moult, whereas primary and tail moult were completed by August. We documented onset of primary moult during chick-rearing in spectacled petrels and <b>great</b> <b>shearwaters</b> (Puffinus gravis) of unknown breeding status, and suggest that the south-west Atlantic Ocean holds important numbers of moulting birds of both species during the summer–early autumn. The albatrosses and the spectacled petrels replaced rectrices alternately. <b>Great</b> <b>shearwaters</b> replaced rectrices outward, starting at the central pair. Primary, tail and body moult largely overlap in all three species, suggesting that the metabolic costs of primary moult may not be overly restrictive.

40|$|We {{describe}} the seabird {{community and the}} distribution of seabirds in the Flemish Cap in the summer of 2002. Data were collected by means of sixty-six 300 m wide boat transects of varied length {{in the first half of}} July. A total of 802 seabirds and 8 species were counted within census transects. Over 70 % of seabirds were <b>Great</b> <b>Shearwaters</b> (Puffinus gravis), followed by Northern Fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis) with 17. 1 % of the seabirds recorded. The number of seabirds recorded per census transect was, on average, very low (mean = 10. 68, SD = 19. 54) and no seabirds were observed in 20 transects. Overall seabird abundance was 8. 78 birds km- 1 (n = 66, SD = 16. 98). Seabird abundance and seabird species richness were not evenly distributed across the Flemish Cap but seemed to concentrate at the edges of the southern half of the study area. This pattern suggests that seabirds were mostly distributed in the area of confluence of the North Atlantic Current with the Labrador Current. We also call attention on the possibility that the Flemish Cap may be an important area for wintering <b>Great</b> <b>Shearwaters...</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>great</b> <b>shearwater's</b> {{relationships}} are unclear. It {{belongs in the}} group of large species that have been separated as genus Ardenna (Penhallurick & Wink 2004); within these, it might be allied with the other black-billed, blunt-tailed species, the short-tailed shearwater and especially the sooty shearwater (Austin 1996, Heidrich et al. 1998). Alternatively (Austin 1996, Austin et al. 2004), it could be a monotypic subgenus (Ardenna sensu stricto), an Atlantic representative of the light-billed Hemipuffinus group (pink-footed shearwater and flesh-footed shearwater).|$|R
50|$|The pink-footed shearwater (Ardenna creatopus) is {{a species}} of seabird. The bird is 48 cm in size, with a 109 cm wingspan.
