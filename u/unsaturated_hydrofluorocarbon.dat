40|$|When {{assessing}} {{the suitability of}} next generation refrigerants for use with current HVACR system materials, two areas of concern need to be thoroughly investigated and understood: 1) chemical stability of the fluids when exposed to system materials under the anticipated conditions of use, and 2) compatibility of the system materials when {{in contact with the}} fluids. This paper will summarize materials compatibility evaluations of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>hydrofluorocarbon</b> (HFO) refrigerants, and HFO refrigerants blended with R- 32, that were conducted to better understand potential equipment reliability risks {{associated with the use of}} next generation low global warming potential (GWP) refrigerant candidates. This paper summarizes results of laboratory measurements of the physical and functional changes of elastomeric and polymeric materials, and hermetic compressor motor materials, as a consequence of accelerated fluid exposures...|$|E
40|$|Gas-phase {{reaction}} of CFC- 12 (CCl 2 F 2) with methane {{was carried out}} in a plug flow reactor over the temperature range of 873 - 1123 K. The major organic halocarbons formed during the reaction were C 2 F 4, C 2 H 2 F 2, CHClF 2, CH 3 Cl, C 3 H 2 F 6 and CCl 3 F. The formation of all products except C 2 H 2 F 2 decreased with temperature, while the selectivity to C 2 H 2 F 2 (difluoroethylene) increased with temperature and reached â‰ˆ 80 % at 1123 K. Under these reaction conditions, methane acts as hydrogen and carbon source, resulting in the formation of an <b>unsaturated</b> C 2 <b>hydrofluorocarbon</b> from two C 1 precursors...|$|R
