When these conditions are present tiny algae called Rhizosolenia, part of the diatom family, begin to flourish. No thicker than two or three times the width of a human hair, they pile up ahead of the line as it moves west. They breed once a day to form baby diatomettes and this creates a very localized food source, that all the fish are attracted to.

5000|$|The word [...] "eigenstrain" [...] was {{introduced}} by T. Mura {{on the basis of}} the German words [...] "Eigenspannungen" [...] and [...] "Eigenspannungsquellen". In the field of continuum mechanics, an eigenstrain is a kind of strain (deformation) produced without external forces (stress-free). Thermal expansion [...] and phase changes are eigenstrains. An eigenstrain can produce a self-equilibrated stress field called [...] "eigenstress". As an example, if a piece of metal is not uniformly heated, the inhomogeneity of the thermal expansion (the incompatibility of the eigenstrain) induces stresses in the metal, without external forces: the eigenstress. A bimetal is used to estimate the temperature thanks to the deformation of the bimetal due to eigenstresses (here the temperature is uniform in the bimetal but not the eigenstrain, because of the difference of thermal expansion coefficients between the metals used in the bimetal). When a hot piece of glass is put <b>under</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water,</b> it can break because of this eigenstress.|$|E

50|$|Hard-boiled eggs {{can vary}} widely in {{how easy it}} is to peel away the shells. In general, the fresher an egg before boiling, the more {{difficult}} it is to separate the shell cleanly from the egg white. As a fresh egg ages, it gradually loses both moisture and carbon dioxide through pores in the shell; as a consequence, the contents of the egg shrink and the pH of the albumen becomes more basic. Albumen with higher pH (more basic) is less likely to stick to the egg shell, while pockets of air develop in eggs that have lost significant amounts of moisture, also making eggs easier to peel. Keeping the cooked eggs soaked in water helps keep the membrane under the egg shell moisturized for easy peeling. Peeling the egg <b>under</b> <b>cold</b> running <b>water</b> is an effective method of removing the shell. Starting the cooking in hot water also makes the egg easier to peel.|$|R

40|$|Development of {{sublethal}} {{stress in}} Escherichia coli exposed in situ to estuarine waters was examined during various seasons. An electrochemical detection technique was utilized to derive a stress index {{based upon the}} difference between a predicted electrochemical response time in Trypticase soy broth or EC medium at 44. 5 degrees C estimated from a standard curve for unstressed cells and an observed response time for cells exposed to seawater. This stress index was related to recovery efficiencies of seawater-exposed cells, using a variety of standard and resuscitative enumeration procedures. Stress was further studied by determination of the adenylate energy charge. Sublethal stress as measured by the electrochemical detection method was an inverse function of water temperature, with maximum stress occurring after exposure to temperatures below 10 degrees C. Total adenylates and ATP decreased dramatically at low temperatures, although energy charge remained relatively constant under various environmental conditions. Decreases in E. coli ATP suggest that ATP may not be an adequate measure of biomass for in situ stressed cells. Discrepancies in enumeration efficiency were most pronounced at temperatures below 10 degrees C.

40|$|Oil shale in Jordan {{belongs to}} the Muwaqqar Chalk Marl {{formation}} (MCM) of the Maastrichtian-Paleocene. Jordanian oilshales are not shales but carbonates. The inorganic constituents are: carbonates, clays, silica, phosphates, and sulphur. Their averages are: 60 %, 6. 5 %, 3. 5 %, 6 % and % respectively. Sulphur is present mostly associated with the organic matter with minor occurrence as pyrite. The Organic Matter (OM) content varies from zero up to 37 %. It consists essentially of kerogen with minor bitumen or Extractable Organic Matter (EOM). The precursor organisms for the OM are phytoplanktons like dinoflagellates and zooplanktons mostly planktonic foraminifera with minor benthic. Under the light microscope and the scanning electronic microscope, the organic matter is essentially amorphous which is produce from the marine planktonics by bacterial degradation.

Six commercial soybean seed lots of the cultivar BRS 133 were used. The physiological potential of the seed lots was evaluated by germination on paper towel and sand box, seedling field emergence, tetrazolium, accelerated aging and electrical conductivity tests. Seed moisture content was also determined. The temperature used for the cold test procedures was 10 °C during five days.

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 156 - 160. The {{extraction}} of gold from ore {{that has been}} mined {{is the most important}} part of the process which eventually produces gold bullion. The process most commonly used today is that of carbon-in-pulp gold extraction (CIP). One of the main reasons for this is that it is the most economically efficient method of extracting gold from ore. The process uses activated carbon to absorb gold from a cyanide leach solution. Slurry containing the gold bearing ore and the activated carbon flow in a counter-current fashion. This counter-current flow enables a high percentage of the gold to be recovered. Gold can then be recovered through an elution process. Large amounts of activated carbon are used in the process and a formal multi variable control study of the adsorption section of the CIP process could provide further economic savings by extracting more gold with controlled amounts of carbon. A study was performed to identify the chemical mechanisms involved in the adsorption section of a CIP plant. It was felt that the workings of the process could best be established by designing a simple simulator of the process. The simulator was designed with four reactor tanks, in which the carbon absorbs gold from the leached slurry. The simulator uses a continuous transfer of carbon. In order to fully understand the operation of the HERIG, a simulation study was performed. This simulated model was a simplified version of the actual rig. The level changes of <b>COLD</b> <b>water</b> in the tanks were assumed to be instantaneous and the heat transfer coefficients were assumed to be the same for all four of the tanks. The calculation of the heat transfer coefficients was investigated thoroughly and care was taken to obtain accurate values. The simulator designed was a lumped parameter model. The pipes containing the HOT stream were divided into many small section, in each of which a constant temperature was assumed. A sum of the contributions of all the sections submerged <b>under</b> the <b>COLD</b> <b>water</b> was used to calculate the heat transferred into the <b>COLD</b> <b>water.</b> The <b>COLD</b> <b>water</b> in the tank is stirred continuously and is assumed to be at a constant temperature. The level of <b>COLD</b> <b>water</b> in each tank on the HERIG represents the mass of carbon in each of the tanks on a CIP plant. A change in the HOT water pipe temperature (concentration of Au in slurry) was examined as a function of a change in the level of <b>COLD</b> <b>water</b> in a tank (mass of carbon in a reactor). A steady state and dynamic analysis verified that trends observed from the CIP model were in fact mimicked by the trends observed on the HERIG. It was then decided to perform a formal control study of the HERIG, since the numerous similarities found between the CIP and HERIG enabled relevant conclusions to be drawn about the control of CIP from the control of the HERIG...|$|R
