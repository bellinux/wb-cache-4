40|$|This paper investigates whether <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> have an {{incentive}} to maintain low regulatory standards in order to attract black money activities. Using a new dataset on money laundering regulation, {{the results of this study}} show that <b>tax</b> <b>haven</b> and money laundering services coincide within the same country. This effect is especially observable for regulative instruments which increase the probability of detecting money laundering; whereas in the case of punitive regulation for money laundering the complementary relationship is weaker, perhaps due to a "false friends" effect. If we classify <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> according to their per capita GDP, poorer <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> in particular tend to supply both services, because the gains from their <b>tax</b> <b>haven</b> status are low compared to those of wealthier and well-established <b>tax</b> <b>havens.</b> From a policy perspective the results add new insights to the debate on the welfare effects of <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> since the results suggest that poorer <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> might be reluctant to provide the necessary regulatory environment in order to constrain money laundering.

40|$|<b>Tax</b> <b>havens</b> have {{attracted}} increasing attention from policy-makers in recent years. This paper {{provides an overview}} of {{a growing body of research}} that analyses the consequences and determinants of the existence of tax-haven countries. For instance, recent evidence suggests that <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> tend to have stronger governance institutions than comparable non-haven countries. Most importantly, <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> provide opportunities for tax planning by multinational corporations. It is often argued that <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> erode the <b>tax</b> base of high-tax countries by attracting such corporate activity. However, while <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> host a disproportionate fraction of the world's foreign direct investment (FDI), their existence need not make high-tax countries worse off.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} an {{endogenous growth}} model featuring <b>tax</b> <b>havens,</b> and {{uses it to}} examine how the existence of <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> affects the economic growth rate and social welfare in high-tax countries. We show {{that the presence of}} <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> generates two conflicting channels in determining the growth effect. First, the public investment effect states that <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> may erode <b>tax</b> revenues and in turn decrease the government’s infrastructure expenditure, thereby reducing growth. Second, the tax planning effect of <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> reduces marginal cost of capital and hence encourages capital accumulation so as to spur economic growth. The overall growth effect is ambiguous and is determined by the extent of these two effects. The welfare analysis shows that <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> {{are more likely to be}} welfare-enhancing if the government expenditure share in production is low, or the initial income tax rate is high. Moreover, the welfare-maximizing income tax rate is lower than the growth-maximizing income tax rate if <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> are present. ...|$|R

Furthermore, the motives for Chinese <b>tax</b> <b>haven</b> activity are analysed and compared to the motives of Western companies that primarily use <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> {{for the purpose of}} tax arbitrage. An analysis of two listed Chinese companies, a private and a state-owned entity (SOE), exemplifies how Chinese businesses incorporate <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> into their business structure and discusses differences between the motives of private and state-owned companies. The magnitude of <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> found in the business structures emphasise the importance of <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> for Chinese companies, irrespective of whether the company is an SOE or private, or conducts its business in China or internationally.
