40|$|As the {{email system}} {{is widely used}} as a {{communication}} channel, and often is crucial {{for the performance of}} organizations, it is important that users can trust the content of what is being delivered to them. A standard called DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) has been developed by the IETF to solve the problem with authentication and integrity, by using digital signatures. This master's thesis goal is to evaluate the solution where an implementation of DKIM is extended with DNSSEC validation. DNSSEC is a solution which secures, among other, the mapping between IP addresses and domain names. The implementation of DKIM is deployed and evaluated with function testing, domain testing, threat analysis, and interoperability testing. DKIM does not need any new public-key infrastructure, thus inflicting less cost on the deployment compared with other cryptographic solutions such as S/MIME and PGP. We recommended to use DKIM together with DNSSEC to secure the transportation of the DKIM public key. The upcoming standard ADSP can inform the recipient of whether a domain is signing its email or not and thereby a possibility to detect any <b>unauthorized</b> <b>signature</b> removal. A further problem is that mailing lists often manipulate the email, thus breaking the signature. We therefore recommend to send email directly to the recipient or active DKIM signing on the mailing lists...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-An {{intrusion}} detection system (IDS) is intelligent engine {{which is used to}} identify anomalies (abnormality) in a computer network system. Intrusions are generally <b>unauthorized</b> access <b>signatures</b> which is like a attacks for network that attempts to either prevent normal functioning of nodes in a network or to harm the nodes with malicious scripts or to sniff unauthorized packets. Intrusion detection system (IDS) reports alarms when it detects any attacks (abnormal) condition. IDS is working in dynamically changing environment. It works by detecting a signature from current session of packet transfer and matching it with database intrusion signatures. Basically IDS consists of prediction engine which analyzes data and outputs the prediction on the data. By seeing predictions system operator is able to know that data record is normal or i...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a statistics-based anomaly detection technique for identifying systems {{that could have}} been compromised and had trojan executables installed. Attackers frequently install rootkits and other trojan files onto hosts they compromise so they can easily gain access in the future. Many detection systems use <b>signatures</b> to identify <b>unauthorized</b> files, but <b>signatures</b> for all platforms and patch levels do not exist in large-scale environments, such as government and university networks. Our anomaly detection system organizes hosts into clusters based on their files and uses statistics to identify those that should be examined in more detail. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Botnets {{have become}} the most {{powerful}} tool for attackers to victimize countless users across cyberspace. Previous work on botnet detection has mainly focused on identifying infected bot computers or IP addresses and not on identifying bot processes on a host machine. This paper aims to fill this gap by presenting a bot process detection technique based on process symptoms such as: TCP connection attempts, DNS activities, digital <b>signatures,</b> <b>unauthorized</b> process tampering, and process hiding. We partition symptoms into sets which are input into classifiers generating individual detection models which are later appropriately integrated so as to improve the detection accuracy. The integrated approach correctly identified two bot processes and did not produced any false positives and false negatives...|$|R
40|$|Communication between {{parties in}} an {{important}} process in their relationship can {{be based on a}} contract. This communication can for exemple be composed by a handwritten contract or an electronic contract. Contract law makes no difference between these two forms. to create more favourable requirements for commencing a contract or an ongoing contract there are possibilities to use standard agreements. Therefore a contract can be based on the will of the parties or on a standard agreement. An electronic signature shall secure that electronic transferred information has not been altered and also to identify the sender of the information. By way of encryption information in a document is guarded from <b>unauthorized</b> acess. Electronic <b>signatures</b> are produced by using encryption technology which is devided into two groups, symmetrical and asymmetrical encryption. It is possible to secure this encryption in a "smart card" which functions like a charge card. To verify a signature {{is just as important as}} using encryption to secure information. A third party can be engaged by both parties. A company or a public authority can be engaged as long as they have no interest in the intermediary information. Who this third party is can be confirmed in a certificate. This certificate can also consist of details about the sender confirming that it is the right party. Existing legislation is available since swedish contract law is applicable on electronic contracts and signatures. Two EC-directives concerning this area are also available for the parties to apply when using electronic contracts. Both directives are acknowledging electronic contracts and signatures the same legal effect as other forms of contracts, like handwritten and oral ones. Further they do not accept national laws that are making it difficult or that are forbidding the use of electronic communication...|$|R
