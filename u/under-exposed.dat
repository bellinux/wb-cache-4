50|$|The {{method is}} useful in images with {{backgrounds}} and foregrounds that are both bright or both dark. In particular, the method can lead to better views of bone structure in x-ray images, and to better detail in photographs that are over or <b>under-exposed.</b> A key advantage of the method {{is that it is}} a fairly straightforward technique and an invertible operator. So in theory, if the histogram equalization function is known, then the original histogram can be recovered. The calculation is not computationally intensive. A disadvantage of the method is that it is indiscriminate. It may increase the contrast of background noise, while decreasing the usable signal.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} type of autobracketing is {{exposure}} autobracketing (often abbreviated to AEB for Automatic Exposure Bracketing or BR for Bracketing), where the camera is set to capture the same image several times with different exposure settings, both over-exposed and <b>under-exposed</b> (lighter and darker) compared to the current setting on the camera, which may already include exposure compensation. Depending on the camera, the difference between each of the autobracketed shots could be anywhere from one-quarter up to three full stops in each direction, in full, half, third or quarter stop increments, ranging from two up to nine shots in series. Sometimes it is possible to either define the order, in which the shots will be taken, or to give an offset as a start-point of the bracketing series. More sophisticated equipment allows auto-exposure bracketing to be combined with timer and intervalometer functions as well.|$|E
50|$|The role of {{the budding}} Dutch navy in {{the defeat of the}} Spanish Armada in August 1588, has often been <b>under-exposed.</b> It was crucial, however. After the fall of Antwerp the Sea-Beggar {{veterans}} under admiral Justinus van Nassau (the illegitimate elder brother of Maurice) had been blockading Antwerp and the Flemish coast with their nimble flyboats. These mainly operated in the shallow waters off Zeeland and Flanders that larger warships with a deeper draught, like the Spanish and English galleons, could not safely enter. The Dutch therefore enjoyed unchallenged naval superiority in these waters, even though their navy was inferior in naval armament. An essential element of the plan of invasion, as it was eventually implemented, was the transportation of a large part of Parma's Army of Flanders as the main invasion force in unarmed barges across the English Channel. These barges would be protected by the large ships of the Armada. However, to get to the Armada, they would have to cross the zone dominated by the Dutch navy, where the Armada could not go. This problem seems to have been overlooked by the Spanish planners, but it was insurmountable. Because of this obstacle, England never was in any real danger. However, as it turned out, the English navy defeated the Armada before the embarkation of Parma's army could be implemented, turning the {{role of the}} Dutch moot. The Army of Flanders escaped the drowning death Justinus and his men had in mind for them, ready to fight another day.|$|E

30|$|However, in {{the case}} of a SFA set-up, {{different}} sensitivities are present on the same chip and may lead to over- and <b>under-exposed</b> classes of pixels, depending on the scene and on the illumination. This is illustrated by Thomas et al. [7], where the sensitivities of the less-sensitive band and the most-sensitive band (see Fig. 1) show a relative efficiency ratio in the interval [11 %, 99 %] for a set of practical filters, an ideal viewing illuminant and a perfect diffuser. In such cases, it is more likely that a single optimal integration time shall generate either saturated values or <b>under-exposed</b> pixels, as indicated by results reported in their article. Figure 1 (e) shows a raw image captured with an SFA camera. On a zoom on Fig. 1 (e), we can observe a severe discrepancy between pixel intensity values for a uniform patch.|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} high {{dynamic range}} image hallucination for adding {{high dynamic range}} details to the over-exposed and <b>under-exposed</b> regions of a low dynamic range image.

Hence, we can add high dynamic range details to a region by simply transferring texture details from another patch that may be under different illumination levels. In our approach, a user only needs to annotate the image with a few strokes to indicate textures that {{can be applied to the}} corresponding <b>under-exposed</b> or over-exposed regions, and these regions are automatically hallucinated by our algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that our simple, yet effective approach is able to significantly increase the amount of texture details in a wide range of common scenarios, with a modest amount of user interaction...|$|E

With the endoflash, the light source being intra-abdominal, there is no loss of light and the pelvis panoramic views are very well exposed (diapositive n° 4, flash in position 3). The shooting films within 2 cms are, however, to exclude, because they get over-exposed, even if the flash is in position 1, particularly, for very clear organs.

40|$|We {{present a}} fully {{automatic}} method for eliminating misalignments between {{a sequence of}} hand-held photographs taken at different exposures. The key component of the technique is the SIFT method that is employed to search for key-points (or feature-points) in consecutive images. The key-points are used to find matrices, that transform a set of images to a single coordinate system and eliminate any global misalignments (including general planar homography). We employ this technique to capture high dynamic range images from a set of photographs taken at different exposures, where misalignments can cause blurring and artifacts, and prevent achieving high quality HDR images. The proposed alignment technique works well for over- and <b>under-exposed</b> images and is not sensitive to an image content.

40|$|Sky/cloud images {{obtained}} from ground-based sky-cameras are usually captured using a fish-eye lens {{with a wide}} field of view. However, the sky exhibits a large dynamic range in terms of luminance, more than a conventional camera can capture. It is thus difficult to capture the details of an entire scene with a regular camera in a single shot. In most cases, the circumsolar region is over-exposed, and the regions near the horizon are <b>under-exposed.</b> This renders cloud segmentation for such images difficult. In this paper, we propose HDRSeg – an effective method for cloud segmentation using High-Dynamic-Range (HDR) imaging based on multi-exposure fusion. We describe the HDR generation process and release a new database to the community for benchmarking.

40|$|Introduction: HIV exposed but uninfected infants {{have been}} shown to have a higher {{morbidity}} and mortality than unexposed infants. There is almost no literature comparing the short-term outcomes of HIV exposed versus unexposed VLBW neonates who are born prematurely. Methods: A retrospective review of all VLBW neonates who were admitted at Groote Schuur Hospital nursery from 2012 - 2014. Data were obtained from the Vermont Oxford Database and the Prevention of Mother to Child register. Results: A total of 1593 VLBW neonates were admitted during the 3 years of which it was possible to obtain maternal HIV status in 1579 babies. Of these 1579 babies, 316 (20 %) were HIV exposed. Eleven of the 230 (4. 8 %) infant HIV tests were positive. There was no difference in mortality, birth weight, gestational age, length of stay, sepsis and delivery room outcomes for the HIV-exposed (HIVE), maternal ARV-exposed (mARVE) and HIV-positive neonates. Differences between HIV exposed and HIV unexposed neonates were noted in an increased risk of NEC [OR 1. 83 (1. 2 - 2. 8) ] and an increased need for ventilation [OR 1. 35 (1. 01 - 1. 8) ]. Maternal antiretroviral exposed neonates developed less NEC compared with maternal antiretroviral <b>under-exposed</b> neonates with a birth weight under 1000 grams appearing to contribute in the development and outcome of NEC. Differences in HIV-positive neonates included more chronic lung disease [OR 5. 49 (1. 31 - 23) ] and more necrotising enterocolitis [OR 4. 12 (1. 02 - 17. 18) ]. Conclusion: This study is the first to compare the short-term outcomes of HIV exposed and HIV unexposed very low birth weight infants and consider maternal ARV exposure. It demonstrated no difference in birth weight, gestational age, mortality or sepsis. Necrotising enterocolitis is increased in the HIV exposed neonates especially if they are <b>under-exposed</b> to maternal antiretrovirals. Adequate maternal antiretrovirals may have a protective effect on incidence of necrotising enterocolitis and respiratory outcomes...|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{a method to}} easily and quickly extend the dynamic range imaging capabilities of the camera in a typical interferometric approach. The camera dynamic range is usually low and limited to 256 gray levels. Also, {{it is well known}} that one may have over or <b>under-exposed</b> regions in the interferogram (due to non-uniform illumination) which makes these image regions not reliable. In our proposed method it is not necessary to obtain or use the non-linear camera response curve in order to extend the camera dynamic range. We obtain a sequence of differently exposed interferograms, typically five or six; after that, we compute the corresponding normalized fringe patterns and modulation maps using a typical normalization method. These normalized patterns are combined through a temporal weighted average using as weights the corresponding modulation maps.

Although many image enhancement techniques have been proposed to solve this problem, existing methods inevitably introduce contrast under- and over-enhancement. Inspired by human visual system, we design a multi-exposure fusion framework for low-light image enhancement. Based on the framework, we propose a dual-exposure fusion algorithm to provide an accurate contrast and lightness enhancement. Specifically, we first design the weight matrix for image fusion using illumination estimation techniques. Then we introduce our camera response model to synthesize multi-exposure images. Next, we find the best exposure ratio so that the synthetic image is well-exposed in the regions where the original image is <b>under-exposed.</b> Finally, the enhanced result is obtained by fusing the input image and the synthetic image according to the weight matrix.
