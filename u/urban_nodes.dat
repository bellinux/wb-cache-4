40|$|The {{beginning}} of the project consisted of creating the framework for the <b>urban</b> <b>node.</b> First {{it was decided to}} use the beach promenade as scene for the prototype and assume full access to the local fiber network. Also it was assumed that the <b>urban</b> <b>node</b> could draw power from the local electricity network when needed and sell back excess power generated. The project brief can be boiled to the following definition of the urban node: • Generate more energy than it consumes • Intelligent lighting • Distribution of WIFI from local fiber network • Aesthetically and contextual appropriate • Modular design • Sustainable design • Use of ICT 1 to gather local information The idea is to have an interior system consisting of three different elements: a power unit delivering and controlling renewable energy, an acquisition unit to obtain inputs from sensors and users and a brain unit to analyze and interpret these impulses into useful and accessible data In order to comprehend the needs that should be addressed by the <b>urban</b> <b>node,</b> relevant topics were researched, such as demographics, human factors, state of art, smart cities etc. After compiling the research it was translated into a function analysis, which is the guideline for the current design of the <b>urban</b> <b>node.</b> With the function analysis as a guideline several shapes were investigated to see how they would function as a shell for the features earlier selected.

40|$|Nowadays, being a {{smart city}} is {{becoming}} more important. It is because of increasing energy use and the costs that come with it, that {{people all over the}} world are looking for better methods to decrease the environmental effects and costs. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to find out if there is a better way to use the streetlights in Vilanova i la Geltrú in order to go forward in the direction of being a smart city. Vilanova i la Geltrú currently has 10. 800 Streetlights, and the energy consumption for these street lights cost a huge amount of money each year. This number can be decreased by finding new ways. This will be done, by further developing a street light called the ‘Urban Node’. This further development will be based on a previous research done. This <b>Urban</b> <b>Node</b> will be a replacement of the current street light. It includes components like led lights, solar panel and a wind turbine. It generates energy by using wind turbines and a solar panel instead of the current regular street light. In this research a certain methodology has been used, which includes expert interviews, an observation and desk research. As a result of using these methods, there has been made a simulation of a renewed streetlight system mostly revolving around the new product adding to the current system, which is the <b>Urban</b> <b>Node.</b> Concluding the results it has been found that implementing the <b>Urban</b> <b>Node</b> is more cost and energy efficient than the current street light system that has been used within Vilanova i la Geltrù. Furthermore, in this report there will be explained what the <b>Urban</b> <b>Node</b> exactly is, how it is structured, where it should be implemented, how it should be implemented and how it is more cost and energy efficient than the current system...|$|R

50|$|The PIU accepts {{that the}} {{automobile}} {{is here to}} stay, but {{that it should not}} be made essential by design. A well planned metropolis would densify along mass transit corridors and around major urban hubs. Smaller, yet dense, <b>urban</b> <b>nodes</b> are seen as micro-zones of medium level density, public amenities and pedestrian access. At these points lower level nodal split will occur, such as between bus loops and cycle tracts. The PIU views nodal split points as places of urban conviviality and access to services and facilities. Modal split can be between walking, cycling, driving, and mass transit. Bus loops may feed larger rail-based rapid-movement corridors. Social and economic infrastructure becomes more intensive as movement corridors become more intense.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 12 While {{surviving}} as {{a monument}} to the power of car culture in the 20 th century, today the gas station has become increasing obsolete in the face of growing cities and increasing environmental awareness. Alternative energy sources and different modes of transit such as walking, biking, car sharing, and public transit have grown in popularity. As a result, the number of gas stations nationally has decreased since the 1970 s, especially in urban contexts. While the redevelopment of gas station sites aims to increase density by filling the voids in the fabric once dedicated to the car, they typically fail to address the history of the site as an <b>urban</b> <b>node</b> in the circulation of people, vehicles, and energy. With their prime urban locations and past associations, the sites of former gas stations have the potential to become new nodes of distribution and communication in the city. This thesis argues that the obsolesce of the urban gas station offers the potential for a new building type that will better serve today’s changing needs for transportation and distribution of energy. The proposal consists of the design for a small-scale <b>urban</b> amenity <b>node,</b> or “Energy Commons” in Seattle. The “Energy Commons” will combine utilitarian functions with a contextual neighborhood-based program through personal vehicle recharging, neighborhood co-working offices, cyclist and pedestrian amenities, and solar energy and water harvesting and storage. The goal is to transform the former car-centered and consumptive structure into a new public urban asset that is human focused and production-minded...|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} four decades, Iraq, like most other {{developing}} countries, faced very rapid urban growth. Due to thr absence of definite urbanisation policies, the {{major part of the}} urban growth went to the main cities, in particular, the capital Baghdad. Such a pattern of growth created many socio-economic problems at the national, as well as the urban level. This study represents an attempt toward developing a methodology of dealing with urban growth problems on a regional level in Iraq. It aims at finding what is thought to be, under the prevailing socio-economic and physical constraints, the most efficient urban growth pattern in the Upper Euphrates Region (U. E. R.) up to 1985. To achieve this aim the study first reviews and critically examines a wide range of urban growth theories and models. Despite the less or [...] s that were learned from this review and the adoptation of many of their principles in developing this study, they did not provide a ready made answer to the problem of urban growth in the region Secondly, for the better understanding of urbanisation on and spatial development policies in Iraq and the U. E. R. a thorough examination of these and other aspects has been dealt with in part two. Thirdly, after examining the basic techniques {{that could be used in}} analysing the urban growth problem, such as the cost-benefit analysis and its refinement the planning balance sheet, threshold analysis and the goals-achievement analysis, it is found that the latter, at this stage of development in Iraq could be applied in studying such a problem. Finally, three alternative urban growth patterns were considered, i. e., the expansion of the largest urban centre in each <b>urban</b> <b>node,</b> the expansion of the proposed smaller urban centres and the establishment of a new town in each <b>urban</b> <b>node</b> and a set of socio-economic, physical, environmental and structural, factors that were thought to affect strongly the proposed urban growth patterns were incorporated in the analysis.

The vitality of this conclusion was tested by applying sensitivity analysis which supported it. ...|$|R
30|$|Cities are {{networks}} that gradually evolve. At the beginning, cities {{consisted of a}} main street and minor streets connecting to it. In these networks, nodes located on the main corridor had high betweenness value and their failure would cause a breakdown in the whole network.

40|$|This book is {{partially}} {{derived from the}} outcomes of the research project entitled The smart region between Turin and Milan: mobile services as drivers of spatial innovation towards Expo 2015 (developed by the Politecnico di Milano, Dipartimento di Architettura e Studi Urbani (DAStU) in collaboration with Telecom Italia) which were {{the starting point for}} the development of this publication. This research project shares the criticisms brought against the concept of urban smartness (such as the risks of an excessively technocratic and market-oriented approach to city management and planning and of an increasing social segregation in city use), but it acknowledges the potentials of the smart city concept for urban development (such as spatial regeneration, economic and social innovation, environmental sustainability). Within this context, it investigated the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) for the representation, promotion, management and dissemination of an integrated system of services; it explored the spatial impacts of digital services at different scales (local, urban, regional); and it sought to understand how a system of mobile services can encourage new spatial uses and new collective behaviour in the quest for a better quality of places. The book suggests the redefining of well-known spatial and conceptual references, which are taken from the disciplinary debate in the fields of new media and urban studies, and which {{may be related to the}} Internet structure (based on nodes and hypertextual connections activated by the nodes themselves) : • the smart city concept can evolve into the smart region concept (identified by an area dimension), which refers to the metropolitan region between Milan and Turin selected as the spatial context of the research because of its specific features and potentials for innovation; • the Internet of things concept can evolve into the Internet of places concept (identified by a network dimension), which refers to the integration of physical and digital services and represents the specific issue explored within the spatial context of the smart region through adoption of this experimental approach to certain urban functions important for innovation of the metropolitan region (for instance, university campuses); • the <b>urban</b> <b>node</b> concept can evolve into the <b>urban</b> digital <b>node</b> concept (identified by a point dimension), which supports the development of the Internet of places concept from the scale of urban functions (such as university campuses) to a wider spatial scale by intercepting different categories of users (inhabitants, students, city-users) ...|$|R

Data from 109 counties, organized in epidemiological weeks, {{related to a}} dengue fever epidemic that occurred in 2001 in northwestern Sao Paulo state, were used to map the spatial diffusion of cases. The methodology is based on five levels of approaches: four levels that join exact objects/continuous fields models with single/multiple times slices sequences, and a fifth level, {{which is based on}} network analysis of connections between counties. With the single time scale/exact objects level, county clusters, spatial contagion of counties and local incidence rates were mapped; and with the multiple time scale/exact objects level, spatial dynamics of the cases were mapped with a spatial&time sequencing model. Using the single time/continuous field level, isoplethic and tendency surface maps were produced. At the multiple times/continuous field level, spatial diffusion maps and spatial-time mobility of mean geographical center of dengue epidemics are arranged using a sequential maps model. At the last level of methodology, <b>urban</b> <b>node</b> connections are spatially analyzed using road network analysis techniques, to map potential for contagion between counties, spatial dispersion of epidemics between counties, and the path of spread of dengue fever over the region as a whole. The results show the spatial diffusion of dengue fever is most efficient in major highway corridors where the daily trips are more frequent, and where there has been no economic impedance to the circulation of merchandise and people...|$|R
40|$|Through a {{study of}} mapping comes an {{understanding}} of urbanism and its development through history. The goal of this collection is to form a relationship between mapping {{as a means of}} visual communication (through lines and photographs) and poetry (words). The three cities selected for this study are connected through their network of urban grids and city forms, which are remnants of the Holy Roman Empire that once bridged these cities together. Each location is subdivided into two or three sections (which are indicative of the urban states that occur in all three areas). One section illustrates urban centrality, which mandates the existence of a center and a periphery. The poems in this portion reflect experiences within these principal spaces. More specifically, they seek to convey an idea of the burgeoning growth that these cities experience due to an increase in urban traffic, as well as the personal growth that occurs from traversing these areas day to day. In the second section, water is selected as a focal point because of its ability to both connect places as well as break them apart urbanistically. In each city, water is examined as it creates tightness (center, or connectivity) and then release (periphery, or separation). The third section seeks to convey the city as a contrasting entity- one that is seen in light and shadow, night and day, beauty and imperfection. An <b>urban</b> <b>node</b> is a mix of these different aspects, which together create a place’s identity (also known as "placemaking" - the title of this collection). The shared urban experiences between the three selected locations have formed stories, which have been documented through journals and photographs.
