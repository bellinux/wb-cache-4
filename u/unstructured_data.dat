Watson has since been applied to business, healthcare, developers, and universities. For example, IBM has partnered with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to assist with considering treatment options for oncology patients and for doing melanoma screenings. Also, several companies have begun using Watson for call centers, either replacing or assisting customer service agents.|$|E

In the context of relational database systems, <b>unstructured</b> <b>data</b> cannot be stored in predictably ordered columns and rows. One type of <b>unstructured</b> <b>data</b> is typically stored in a BLOB (binary large object), a catch-all data type available in most relational database management systems. <b>Unstructured</b> <b>data</b> may also refer to irregularly or randomly repeated column patterns that vary from row to row within each file or document.|$|E

A total of 120 medical problems in discharge summaries were extracted using NLP software (MedLEE) and aligned with 87 ICD- 9 diagnoses for 19 non-overlapping hospital visits of 4 patients. The alignment accuracy was evaluated by a medical doctor. The average overlap of medical problems between the two data sources obtained by our automatic alignment method was 23. 8 %, which was {{about half of the}} manual review result, 43. 56 %.

5000|$|<b>Unstructured</b> <b>data</b> usually {{refers to}} {{information}} that doesn't reside {{in a traditional}} row-column database. <b>Unstructured</b> <b>data</b> files often include text and multimedia content. Examples include e-mail messages, word processing documents, videos, photos, audio files, presentations, webpages and many other kinds of business documents. Note that while these sorts of files may have an internal structure, they are still considered [...] "unstructured" [...] because the data they contain doesn't fit neatly in a database.Experts estimate that 80 to 90 percent of the data in any organization is unstructured.

40|$|As {{the amount}} of textual {{information}} grows explosively in various kinds of business systems, it {{becomes more and more}} essential to analyze both structured <b>data</b> and <b>unstructured</b> textual <b>data</b> simultaneously. However information contained in non structured data (documents and so on) is only partially used in business intelligence (BI). Indeed On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) cubes which are the main support of BI analysis in decision support systems have focused on structured data. This is the reason why OLAP is being extended to <b>unstructured</b> textual <b>data.</b> In this paper we introduce the innovative “Diamond” multidimensional model that will serve as a basis for semantic OLAP on XML documents and then we describe the meta modeling, generation and implementation of a the Diamond multidimensional model...|$|R

50|$|The {{analysis}} of <b>unstructured</b> <b>data</b> types is another challenge getting {{attention in the}} industry. <b>Unstructured</b> <b>data</b> differs from structured data in that its format varies widely and cannot be stored in traditional relational databases without significant effort at data transformation. Sources of <b>unstructured</b> <b>data,</b> such as email, the contents of word processor documents, PDFs, geospatial data, etc., are rapidly becoming a relevant source of business intelligence for businesses, governments and universities. For example, in Britain the discovery that one company was illegally selling fraudulent doctor's notes in order to assist people in defrauding employers and insurance companies, {{is an opportunity for}} insurance firms to increase the vigilance of their <b>unstructured</b> <b>data</b> analysis. The McKinsey Global Institute estimates that big data analysis could save the American health care system $300 billion per year and the European public sector €250 billion.|$|E

To address this issue, we conducted our research and developed the Natural Language Processing Model to sequentially analyze our <b>unstructured</b> text <b>data,</b> which we collected from MetricsCat's website. Our results from text analysis show that some of the most influential factors in why users adopt and use government apps are the quality of the app, the app's usefulness, whether or not the app is informative, and whether or not the app remains up to date. Our research contains practical and research implications for key government officials and designers of mobile apps...|$|R
