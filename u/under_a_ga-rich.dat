Deposition of Pd onto <b>a</b> <b>Ga-rich</b> GaN(0 0 0 1) surface followed by annealing at similar to 600 degrees C leads to the formation of an ordered Pd/Ga alloy layer, followed by the nucleation and growth of hexagonal Pd nanocrystals. When Pd is deposited on a less Garich surface, the Pd initially wets the surface. With increased Pd coverage the wetted 2 D islands coalesce into 3 D islands without a wetting layer. The 3 D islands have hexagonal shapes with a flat (I 11) top surface, and STM images of the nanocrystal tops show that they are reconstructed. A separate series of experiments was performed investigating Ti deposition on GaN(0 0 0 1), where the Ti reacts with GaN to form TiN. Deposition of Ti onto GaN(0 0 0 1) followed by annealing in UHV results in the formation of 2 D irregular TiN islands, which can be transformed into more regular triangular TiN nanocrystals upon annealing in an ammonia atmosphere. This study shows overall that the growth modes of Pd and Ti are strongly influenced by the stoichiometry and cleanliness of the GaN substrate. Therefore, to create reliable electrical contacts between metals and GaN, the atomic level order and stoichiometry of the GaN substrates needs to be controlled. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|AbstractEmbryonic {{development}} is coordinated by networks of evolutionary conserved regulatory genes encoding transcription factors and components of cell signalling pathways. In the sea urchin embryo, {{a number of}} genes encoding transcription factors display territorial restricted expression. Among these, the zygotic Hbox 12 homeobox gene is transiently transcribed in {{a limited number of}} cells of the animal-lateral half of the early Paracentrotus lividus embryo, whose descendants will constitute part of the ectoderm territory. To obtain insights on the regulation of Hbox 12 expression, we have explored the cis-regulatory apparatus of the gene. In this paper, we show that the intergenic region of the tandem Hbox 12 repeats drives GFP expression in the presumptive aboral ectoderm and that a 234  bp fragment, defined aboral ectoderm (AE) module, accounts for the restricted expression of the transgene. Within this module, a consensus sequence for a Sox factor and the binding of the Otx activator are both required for correct Hbox 12 gene expression. Spatial restriction to the aboral ectoderm is achieved by a combination of different repressive sequence elements. Negative sequence elements necessary for repression in the endomesoderm map within the most upstream 60  bp region and nearby the Sox binding site. Strikingly, a Myb-like consensus is necessary for repression in the oral ectoderm, while down-regulation at the gastrula stage depends on <b>a</b> <b>GA-rich</b> region.

Novel aspects of the VZV OriS include <b>a</b> <b>GA-rich</b> region, three binding sites for the VZV origin-binding protein (OBP) all on the same strand and oriented in the same direction, and a partial OBP binding site of unknown function.

This has been done with a model system using a replication-competent plasmid containing OriS and a replication- and transcription-competent dual-luciferase reporter plasmid containing both the OriS and the intergenic region between VZV open reading frames (ORFs) 62 and 63. We have found that (i) Box D is a negative regulator of DNA replication independent of flanking gene expression, (ii) the mutation of Box D results in a decrease in flanking gene expression, thus a sequence within the VZV OriS affects transcription, which is in contrast to results reported for HSV- 1, (iii) there is a specific Box D complex formed with infected cell extracts in electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments, (iv) supershift assays show that this complex contains the VZV ORF 29 single-strand DNA-binding protein, and (v) the formation of this complex is dependent on the presence of CGC motifs in Box D and its downstream flanking region.

In principle, to grow zincblende GaN the substrate should have four-fold symmetry and thus zincblende GaN has been prepared on several substrates including Si, 3 C–SiC, GaP, MgO, and on GaAs(0 0 1). The iso-structure and a common shared element make the epitaxial growth of GaN on GaAs(0 0 1) feasible and useful. In this study ion-induced conversion of GaAs(0 0 1) surface into GaN at room temperature is optimized. At the outset <b>a</b> <b>Ga-rich</b> surface is formed by Ar+ ion bombardment. Nitrogen ion bombardment of the Ga-rich GaAs surface is performed by using 2 – 4 keV energy and fluence ranging from 3 × 1013 ions/cm 2 to 1 × 1018 ions/cm 2. Formation of surface GaN is manifested as chemical shift. In situ core level and true secondary electron emission spectra by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy are monitored to observe the chemical and electronic property changes. Using XPS line shape analysis by deconvolution into chemical state, we report that 3 keV N 2 + ions and 7. 2 × 1017 ions/cm 2 are the optimal energy and fluence, respectively, for the nitridation of GaAs(0 0 1) surface at room temperature. The measurement of electron emission of the interface shows the dependence of work function to the chemical composition of the interface. Depth profile study by using Ar+ ion sputtering, shows that a stoichiometric GaN of 1 nm thickness forms on the surface. This, room temperature and molecular beam epitaxy compatible, method of forming GaN temperature can serve as an excellent template for growing low defect GaN epitaxial overlayers...|$|R
40|$|Irradiation-induced pattern {{formation}} has {{the potential}} to become a cost-effective method for rapid fabrication of large-area nanostructures. However, on elemental semiconductor surfaces, ion-induced formation of nanostructures such as nanodots and nanorods (NRs) occurs only in the presence of impurities. Alternatively, the surface stoichiometry of III-V compounds is easily modified by ion irradiation, thereby enabling self-organization of nanostructures via a balance between preferential sputtering and ion-enhanced diffusion. In this thesis, several approaches to focused ion beam (FIB) -induced formation of nanostructures, including Ga droplets, InSb ripples, and InSb NRs, were examined, and new insights into their formation were revealed. 	To separately examine Ga droplet formation and coarsening, Ga droplets were fabricated by FIB irradiation of GaAs substrates with and without pre-patterned holes. We determined the droplet growth rate and size distribution as a function of FIB energy. The data suggest a droplet formation mechanism that involves Ga precipitation from <b>a</b> <b>Ga-rich</b> layer, followed by droplet coarsening via a combination of diffusion and Ostwald ripening or coalescence via droplet migration. To investigate the formation and evolution of ripples on FIB irradiated InSb surfaces, the influence of the local beam incidence angle (theta effective) by varying the distance between beam spots and/or the dwell time was examined. With increasing theta effective, the surface morphology evolves from pits to ripples to featureless surfaces. Continued irradiation of the rippled surfaces leads to island formation on the ripple crests, followed by NR growth. This ripple-nanorod transition, triggered by preferential sputtering and island-induced-self-shielding, provides a new approach for producing dense arrays of NRs. 	The formation and evolution of irradiation-induced NRs were examined through a comparison of FIB irradiation of InSb wafers and InSb/GaAs heterostructures. Above a critical ion dose, cone-shaped NRs capped with In islands form on both InSb surfaces. For InSb wafers, the NR base diameter increases with ion energy. In the case of InSb/GaAs heterostructures, as the milled depth approaches the InSb/GaAs interface, the cone-shaped NRs transition to capless NRs with a truncated cone shape. These results suggest a growth mechanism in which both the NR cap and body are supplied by redeposition of sputtered atoms...|$|R
