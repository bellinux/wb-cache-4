40|$|The wild {{progenitor}} (Oryza rufipogon) of Asian rice (Oryza sativa) shows a {{wide range}} of variations in life-history traits, forming an annual-perennial continuum. A conspicuous feature of an <b>annual</b> type of <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> is represented by its adaptability to disturbed habitats, and its short stature with many tillers and a prostrate growth habit. The present study was carried out to examine the genetic differentiation between <b>wild</b> <b>annual</b> and cultivated (Japonica type) rice strains by quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis. In total, 20 adaptive and/or domestication-related traits were evaluated in recombinant inbred lines (RILs). A total of 28 putative QTLs were detected across the genome. Six QTLs responsible for plant architecture were located on the short arm of chromosome 7. The near-isogenic line with the region containing the QTL cluster confirmed that the QTLs exerted a significant effect on the plant architecture in the genetic background of cultivated rice. A similar QTL cluster was also found in another annual strain of a different origin, suggesting that the QTL cluster might be predominant in <b>annual</b> <b>wild</b> <b>rice.</b> Furthermore, a QTL for tolerance to disturbance (simulated trampling) was detected within the region of the cluster on chromosome 7. These results are discussed in relation to their ecological significance in <b>wild</b> <b>annuals</b> of <b>rice...</b>|$|R

This study reports on a field experiment, where <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> seed was sown into 1 m 2 quadrats of established para grass. Para grass cover was manipulated above the <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> seed bed, including clipping and herbicide application. The behaviour of <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> seed under para grass cover {{in this study was}} then compared to its behaviour under <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> cover in a previous study.

30|$|The differing ecologies of the rufipogon {{perennial}} and nivara annual ecotypes of the <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> imply differing {{modes of}} hunter-gatherer exploitation {{and the importance}} and intensity of early cultivation that was necessary (Fuller and Qin 2009). The perennial rufipogon would have normally been a fairly poor grain resource, with more metabolic energy invested in vegetative tissues. This necessitated human manipulation of soil and water environment to induce a drought response of higher grain productivity. Over time {{there would have been}} selection for more annuality and reduced vegetative growth (shorter and straighter growth habit), as well as increasing grain yields and grain size. Thus more intensive human efforts at managing the soil and water conditions of early cultivated rufipogon would have been repaid by increasing yields and the accumulation of domestication genes. The archaeological evidence from the Lower Yangtze supports this inferred process (Fuller and Qin 2009, 2010). By contrast, the <b>annual</b> O. nivara <b>wild</b> <b>rices</b> could have been exploited on a large scale without any serious cultivation, or selection of habit changes or domestication traits. This represents a “proto-indica” hypothesis (Fuller et al. 2010 a) in which intensive exploitation of proto-indica wild types, which probably included burning off competing vegetation and some broadcast sowing, could have taken place for millennia without the evolution of domesticated rice (Fuller 2011). In other words we would expect the adaptive syndrome of <b>annual</b> <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> (Grillo et al. 2009) to have been reinforced through such proto-cultivation.|$|R

40|$|<b>Wild</b> <b>rice,</b> Zizania spp., is a genus {{of locally}} rare but {{important}} emergent grasses {{found in the}} near shore or shallow lake and river habitats of North America. These plants provide important ecological services such as sediment stabilization and nutrient retention, serve as food and shelter for many types of wildlife, and are a crucial component {{of the culture of}} a number of Native American tribes in the Upper Midwest. Habitat loss and fragmentation has limited the size and connectivity of the remaining stands of Zizania aquatica L, <b>annual</b> <b>wild</b> <b>rice,</b> making it a species of conservation interest to many public and private agencies throughout its range. The goals of our research were to examine how a set of Z. aquatica seed provenances respond to the environmental stresses of water depth and early season shading, as well as to compare microsatellite diversity between three of the seed provenances. In the first greenhouse experiment, we found that the <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> grew optimally in saturated, but not submerged, soils. Plants grown in only periodically watered soils experienced drought stress while plants grown at the deepest treatment exhibited signs of light stress, suggesting {{that there may be a}} relatively narrow range of water depths in which Z. aquatica can grow. In the second greenhouse experiment, we found that shaded plants grew slower and accumulated less biomass early in the season than those exposed to full sun, but that the shaded plants were able to recover once given full sun during the aerial leaf stage. However, inflorescence production was delayed by the early season shading which could affect reproductive outcomes. We also found that seed provenance influenced the growth of <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> in both experiments, and similar provenance differentiation was seen in the microsatellite study. Our research suggests that both environmental conditions and the choice of seed source may affect the outcome of <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> conservation or restoration efforts. ...|$|R

The cultural management practices of <b>wild</b> <b>rice,</b> Zizania sp., are largely based on the production of rice, Oryza sativa.

Male gametes carrying the DGS 1 allele from O. nivara (DGS 1 -nivaras) and the DGS 2 allele from O. sativa (DGS 2 -T 65 s) were sterile, but female gametes carrying the same genotype were fertile. We isolated the causal gene, which encodes a protein homologous to DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNAP) III subunit C 4 (RPC 4). RPC 4 facilitates the transcription of 5 S rRNAs and tRNAs. The loss-of-function alleles at DGS 1 -nivaras and DGS 2 -T 65 s were caused by weak or nonexpression of RPC 4 and an absence of RPC 4, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that gene duplication of RPC 4 at DGS 1 and DGS 2 was a recent event that occurred after divergence of the ancestral population of Oryza from other Poaceae or during diversification of AA-genome species...|$|R

Asian accessions did not show any changes at the site. Nuclear INDEL genotypes clearly distinguished O. meridionalis from Asian O. rufipogon and O. sativa. Five accessions of O. rufipogon originating in New Guinea were quite distinct from Asian accessions. Because they had various combinations of nuclear-plastid/mitochondrial types even they had been collected at a single swamp (Katayama 1968). Although these accessions have been defined as O. rufipogon, the primarily species definitions were O. perennis and O. sativa var. spontanea which had been used as <b>annual</b> <b>wild</b> <b>rice.</b> Based on SSR genotypes, three were included in a clade with O. rufipogon. One of the three accession, W 1238 also carried rufipogon-type nuclear INDELs but meridionalis-type organelle genomes like Jpn 1 accessions (Table  3). Two carried meridinoalis-type nuclear and organella genomes. They might belong to O. meridinoalis. Additional accessions along with ecological information for New Guinea are needed to evaluate their genetic characteristics in detail. All the new Australian perennial accessions carried meridionalis-type organellar genomes. However, there are alternative types of perennials based on their nuclear genotypes.|$|R

40|$|<b>Wild</b> <b>rice</b> (Oryza meridionalis Ng) underpins {{vertebrate}} food chains on the monsoonal floodplains. This native annual {{grass is}} {{displaced by the}} introduced pasture, para grass (Brachiaria mutica (Forssk.) Nguyen). This study investigates whether the mechanism for this displacement is through effects on the germination of <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> seed. <b>Wild</b> <b>rice</b> has a seed dormancy mechanism that prevents seeds germinating when they are first dispersed into the moist floodplain soil {{at the end of}} the annual wet season. The presence of para grass may prevent or change environmental cues that would otherwise break dormancy and stimulate germination of <b>wild</b> <b>rice.</b> Initially we found that, under <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> cover, some 76 % of seeds had germinated, 17 % had died and 5 % remained ungerminated after two wet seasons. When <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> seeds were sown into a well established para grass cover, almost no seed germinated, a large proportion remained alive but ungerminated, and a greater proportion died than under <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> cover. We then investigated how para grass may prevent germination of <b>wild</b> <b>rice,</b> by (a) determining dormancy breaking cues for <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> seeds and (b) comparing floodplain seed bed conditions under para grass and <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> cover. In the laboratory, breaking of dormancy was dependent on the seeds being exposed to high temperatures. In the field, para grass produced much higher above ground biomass than <b>wild</b> <b>rice,</b> and modified the seedbed. Temperatures were lower at the soil surface under para-grass cover than under <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> cover. This study showed <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> has a dormancy mechanism, which prevents germination under significant canopy and litter cover. Thus, a weed species (para grass) can modify habitat conditions so that dormancy breaking and germination in a native species (<b>wild</b> <b>rice)</b> is prevented.

The major emphasis of this study to evaluate two of the technological choices that are available to meet those changes. The technologies are a traditional technology and newer experimental technology that has been conceptualized, but not as yet used by the industry. The traditional and experimental technologies use the same basic <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> processing steps (Figure # 1).

Unlike plant macrofossils, which have traditionally been used to identify this plant in prehistoric contexts, silicophytoliths preserve well in archaeological sites and in carbonized food residue encrusted on clay pots. This proxy, therefore, promises to yield considerable new insight into the antiquity and intensity of <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> harvesting in this region. Various phytolith types from various grasses, sedges and aquatic plants were examined. However, the focus was kept on rondel phytoliths, a form only produced in grasses. Thirty-eight grass species were examined, including two species of <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> (Zizania aquatica and Zizania palustris). A minimum of three hundred rondels from each grass species were counted from various parts of the plant including the inflorescence, the leaf and the stem. Based on extensive morphological comparisons of phytoliths produced by <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> (Zizania spp.), and other native Boreal and Prairie grasses and maize (Zea mays), several phytolith morphotypes were identified that are produced only in <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> (Zizania spp.). In general, rondels with four spikes, with one and three indentations, are characteristic of Zizania (spp.). However, differences between the two <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> species were not established. Lake sediments from Lulu Lake in the Lake of the Woods area where modem <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> grows were analysed to determine if the types identified as being diagnostic of <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> would be present. As a preliminary analysis, the presence of <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> (Zizania spp.) can be identified in small quantities in lake sediments. Therefore, <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> (Zizania spp.) phytoliths can be a powerful tool in the identification of the plant in Holocene sediments. Potsherds with encrusted carbonized residues from the Lake of the Woods and surrounding area were also examined for the presence of diagnostic <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> (Zizania spp.) and maize (Zea mays) phytoliths. These archaeological samples are attributed to the Laurel (Middle Woodland), Selkirk (Late Woodland), Blackduck (Late Woodland), and Sandy Lake (Late Woodland) cultures. Based on the use of diagnostic phytolith types for both <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> (Zizania spp.) and maize (Zea mays), the presence ofboth these cultigens was identified in the residues of all four cultures mentioned above. This is the first time maize (Zea mays) and <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> (Zizania spp.) have been positively identified in prehistoric carbonized food residues from the Boreal Forest. Based on pottery types, <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> (Zizania spp.) and maize (Zea mays) were consumed as early as the Middle Woodland period (Laurel phase). Based on the samples examined, the evidence of maize (Zea mays) phytoliths in the residue is greater than those of <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> (Zizania spp.). However, this might reflect sample bias or most likely biases due to processing of the plants before consumption. Therefore, the absence of a <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> (Zizania spp.) phytolith signature might not represent that the plant was not consumed, rather that the parts of the plant with the diagnostic phytolith types were removed before consumption. Maize (Zea mays) horticulture during the Late Woodland period in the Lake of the Woods and surrounding area does not seem likely because {{there is no evidence of}} gardening, or heavy consumption of this plant. However, the latter might not be necessary for local horticulture. In contrast, <b>wild</b> <b>rice</b> (Zizania spp.) stands are common in the Lake of the Woods and surrounding area, and therefore local harvesting of this plant is inferred...|$|R
