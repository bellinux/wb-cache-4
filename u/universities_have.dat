Discoveries and inventions at these <b>universities</b> <b>have</b> resulted in spin-offs worth hundreds of millions to local economies: the discovery of graphene at the University of Manchester produced the National Graphene Institute and the Sir Henry Royce Institute for Advanced Materials, while robotics research at the University of Sheffield {{led to the development}} of the Advanced Manufacturing Park.|$|E
5|$|MIT also places {{among the}} top ten in many overall rankings of {{universities}} (see right) and rankings based on students' revealed preferences. For several years, U.S. News & World Report, the QS World University Rankings, and the Academic Ranking of World <b>Universities</b> <b>have</b> ranked MIT's School of Engineering first, as did the 1995 National Research Council report. In the same lists, MIT's strongest showings apart from in engineering are in computer science, the natural sciences, business, architecture, economics, linguistics, mathematics, and, to a lesser extent, political science and philosophy.|$|E

5|$|Many {{institutes of}} higher {{education}} teach music in Italy. About 75 music conservatories provide advanced training for future professional musicians. There are also many private music schools and workshops for instrument building and repair. Private teaching is also quite common in Italy. Elementary {{and high school students}} can expect to have one or two weekly hours of music teaching, generally in choral singing and basic music theory, though extracurricular opportunities are rare. Though most Italian <b>universities</b> <b>have</b> classes in related subjects such as music history, performance is not a common feature of university education.|$|E
5|$|Most {{universities}} {{focus on}} general studies, mixing together such {{areas of study}} as business, engineering and technology. Seven <b>universities</b> <b>have</b> specialized curricula.

5|$|As part of {{his attempt}} to balance the budget, Corzine {{decreased}} funding to most programs and localities including state universities and colleges. The first of these decreases came with the 2007 budget. Rutgers University and other New Jersey state <b>universities</b> <b>have</b> raised tuition, cut hundreds of sections of classes, and several sports teams. With the latest decrease in funding for 2009, most state institutions have less funding than they had a decade ago. Despite the $15 million in cuts, Rutgers went ahead with previous agreed upon raises of $15 million to their executive faculty. This resulted in Rutgers making $30 million in cuts.|$|E
5|$|From 2017-18 onwards, the £9,000 fee cap {{will rise}} with inflation. Maintenance grants are also {{available}} to current students in England, although these are scheduled to cease with the 2016-17 academic year. Maintenance loans are available for living costs, and these are means tested. These loans are scheduled to increase in size for 2016-17, when the maintenance grant system is phased out. There will be {{a vote in the}} autumn to consider a further increase effective with the 2017-18 year. Several <b>universities</b> <b>have</b> already advertised fees of £9,250 for the year in anticipation of such a vote passing.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Stephen E. Loeb {{proposed}} that accounting ethics education should include seven goals (adapted {{from a list}} by Daniel Callahan). To implement these goals, {{he pointed out that}} accounting ethics could be taught throughout accounting curriculum or in an individual class tailored to the subject. Requiring it be taught throughout the curriculum would necessitate all accounting teachers to have knowledge on the subject (which may require training). A single course has issues as to where to include the course in a student's education (for example, before preliminary accounting classes or near the end of a student's degree requirements), whether there is enough material to cover in a semester class, and whether most <b>universities</b> <b>have</b> room in a four-year curriculum for a single class on the subject.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} competitiveness, {{intensity}} and longevity, the Backyard Brawl with the Pittsburgh Panthers is West Virginia's fiercest and most storied rivalry. Separated by only 70 miles, the two <b>universities</b> <b>have</b> competed on a mostly annual basis since 1895 (beginning in 1920 and resuming again in 1943 after World War II). Although Pitt holds a 61–40–3 series lead, {{more than half}} of its victories in the Backyard Brawl came prior to 1952 when the Panthers dominated the series 34–9–1. The Mountaineers hold a 26–22–2 edge over the Panthers since 1962 when the series began to interchange annually between Morgantown and Pittsburgh. West Virginia has also won seven of the last ten meetings. Put on hiatus following the 2011 season due to conference realignment, the series will resume with four games running from 2022–2025.|$|E
5|$|Many {{commentators}} {{suggested that}} the 2012 rise in tuition fees in England would put poorer students off applying to university. However, the {{gap between rich and}} poor students has slightly narrowed (from 30.5% in 2010 to 29.8% in 2013) since the introduction of the higher fees. This may be because <b>universities</b> <b>have</b> used tuition fees to invest in bursaries and outreach schemes. In 2016, The Guardian noted that the number of disadvantaged students applying to university had increased by 72% from 2006 to 2015, a bigger rise than in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. It wrote that most of the gap between richer and poorer students tends to open up between Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 4 (i.e. at secondary school), rather than when applying for university, and so the money raised from tuition fees should be spent there instead.|$|E
5|$|Of the 74 players {{drafted by}} the Giants in the first round, 26 played {{at one of the}} running back positions. Of these, 10 were halfbacks and six were fullbacks, and the {{remaining}} 10 are credited as backs, blocking backs, or running backs. Among other frequently drafted positions, the Giants have chosen eight defensive backs, eight offensive tackles, six defensive ends, five wide receivers, four defensive tackles, and four quarterbacks. Five of the Giants' first-round picks attended the University of Notre Dame, more than any other college. Four picks came from Miami, while seven <b>universities</b> <b>have</b> had three players selected. The Giants have held the first overall pick twice, in 1951 and 1965, selecting Kyle Rote and Tucker Frederickson. Three of the team's first-round picks—George Connor, Frank Gifford, and Lawrence Taylor—have been elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.|$|E

5|$|The final {{level is}} higher education, or háskóli (lit. “high school”). There are eight such {{institutions}} in the country, {{most of which are}} run by the state. The first institution, the University of Iceland, opened in 1911, and is still the principal higher education institution in the country. In recent years, however, more <b>universities</b> <b>have</b> opened across the country, widening the range of choices available. Legislation concerning higher education institutions was passed in 1997, which includes a definition of the term háskóli (to include universities which do not carry out research). There is also separate legislation in place for each public institution, defining their role in research and general organisation. Private and public universities both receive funding from the state.|$|E
5|$|The {{speed of}} sound in xenon gas (169m/s) is less than that in air because the average {{velocity}} of the heavy xenon atoms is {{less than that of}} nitrogen and oxygen molecules in air. Hence, xenon vibrates more slowly in the vocal cords when exhaled and produces lowered voice tones, an effect opposite to the high-toned voice produced in helium. Like helium, xenon does not satisfy the body's need for oxygen, and it is both a simple asphyxiant and an anesthetic more powerful than nitrous oxide; consequently, and because xenon is expensive, many <b>universities</b> <b>have</b> prohibited the voice stunt as a general chemistry demonstration. The gas sulfur hexafluoride is similar to xenon in molecular weight (146 versus 131), less expensive, and though an asphyxiant, not toxic or anesthetic; it is often substituted in these demonstrations.|$|E
