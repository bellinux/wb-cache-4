The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate mediating factors related to academic underachievement. This investigation examined differences in self-efficacy, use of self-regulatory strategies, attributions, motivational orientation, teacher perceptions of students' motivation, and academic performance among underachieving, normal achieving, and overachieving students in the fourth, sixth, and eighth grades. Students completed questionnaires assessing self-efficacy, use of self-regulatory strategies, attributions for academic performance outcomes, and motivational orientation in the classroom. Teachers completed ratings of these students' motivation for school-related tasks. Reading grades were used as a measure of academic performance. MANOVA procedures were used to analyze all dependent variables (simultaneously) in order to determine whether <b>underachievers,</b> normal achievers, and overachievers could be differentiated along these variables. Follow-up analyses explored which of the dependent variables were important for group separation. MANOVA procedures were also used to determine whether <b>underachievers</b> at each of three grade levels could be differentiated on the basis of these same variables. Follow-up analyses examined specific dependent variables that discriminated between younger and older <b>underachievers.</b> Results indicated that <b>underachievers,</b> normal achievers, and overachievers were differentiated on the basis of the variables under investigation. Over-achievers demonstrated significantly higher self-efficacy for academic tasks than either <b>underachievers</b> or normal achievers. Overachievers and normal achievers (in comparison to <b>underachievers)</b> reported greater use of self-regulatory strategies and demonstrated a significantly greater intrinsic-motivational orientation. The low reliability of the measure of school-related attributions utilized within the present study precluded analysis of this variable. Overachievers received the highest-teacher ratings of motivation while normal achievers received significantly higher ratings than <b>underachievers.</b> Overachievers similarly demonstrated the highest-academic performance followed by the normal achievers. With respect to developmental trends among <b>underachievers</b> along the dependent variables, self-efficacy, use of self-regulatory strategies, intrinsic-motivational orientation, and teacher ratings of students' motivation tended to increase from the fourth to sixth grades and decrease from the sixth to eighth grades. Older <b>underachievers</b> demonstrated significantly lower-academic performance than younger <b>underachievers...</b>|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MA(Sielkunde)) [...] PU vir CHOThis {{investigation}} explored {{differences between}} academically underachieving and overachieving pupils {{in relation to}} motivation and personality in a Transvaal secondary school. The hypothetical concept was that <b>underachievers</b> and overachievers would differ greatly and significantly with regard to personality and motivational traits. From a population of 565 pupils three experimental groups were compiled, viz: a control group, a group of <b>underachievers</b> {{and a group of}} overachievers, each consisting of thirty subjects. As criterion for the academic achievement of the subjects, their academic achievement in school for 1975 was used and the experimental groups were compiled in such a way, that the <b>underachievers</b> and overachievers reflect the greatest discrepancy between academic achievement and IQ. The relationship between the verbal and non-verbal average score of each experimental group for the IQ Test, was investigated. This did not differ significantly. The relationship between IQ and academic achievement was also investigated. In the case of the <b>underachievers</b> and over- achievers significant differences in relation to I IQ and academic achievement were found. Personality and motivation were measured by two tests: the HSPQ and the Pauli Test. Statistical methods used were the t-Test and the Chi-square Test. The latter were used for the significance of differences between <b>underachievers</b> and overachievers with regard to motivation and personality. In main the results of this investigation did not underline the findings of most other investigators. For all three experimental groups the personality traits disclosed by the HSPQ were basically the same. However, the <b>underachievers</b> and overachievers did differ significantly with regard to intelligence and Factor I "Sensitivity" (5 % level of significance). The overachievers tend to be more sensitive than the <b>underachievers.</b> Most investigators report a positive relationship between introversion - extroversion and overachievement and underachievement. This was not found in this investigation. The same can be started with regard to self-concept and creativity. The Pauli Test did not produce results which differentiate significantly between <b>underachievers</b> and overachievers. However, certain conclusions could made: it seems as if overachievers (in this investigation) were better motivated than <b>underachievers.</b> The findings of the HSPQ and Pauli Tests were used for a cumulative profile in which the main personality differences between <b>underachievers</b> and overachievers were underlined.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare a {{national}} sample of gifted <b>underachievers</b> and gifted high achiev-ers on a number of characteristics. Giftedness was measured as a composite score at or above the 95 th percentile on the American College Testing Program (ACT). Underachievement was defined as reporting a high school grade-point average of &le; 2. 25 (on a 4. 00 scale), and high achievement was defined as reporting a grade-point average of &ge; 3. 75 (on a 4. 00 scale). Partici-pants for this study were 30, 604 high school juniors and seniors: gifted <b>underachievers</b> n= 257; gifted high achiev-ers n= 30, 347. The <b>underachievers</b> generally had lower scores on the ACT and less extensive out-of-class ac-complishments. Over 90 % of the <b>underachievers</b> were Caucasian males. Comparisons are provided on a num-ber of nonacademic variables between <b>underachievers</b> and high achievers. Gifted <b>underachievers</b> have been a source of controversy for educational researchers and a source of frustration for classroom teachers. Educational researchers disagree about the nature., and even the existence, of gifted <b>underachievers</b> (see Behrens & Vernon, 1978). Anastasi (1976) questioned the legitimacy of underachievement as a category of academic behavior, particularly when discrepancies between intelligence test scores and achievement test scores are the only evidence of underachievement. Most underachievement, according to Anastasi, is simpty test error: a statistical artifact of imperfect methods of measurement.

According to Rob Sheffield, it was Morrison's [...] "most beautiful and intense album", the foundation for his [...] "legend", and a work that continues to captivate musicians and listeners. Lester Bangs said its anguished feeling resonated with him on first listen, calling it [...] "the rock record with the most significance in my life so far ... a record about people stunned by life, completely overwhelmed, stalled in their skins, their ages and selves, paralyzed by the enormity of what in one moment of vision they can comprehend." [...] Irish musician Glen Hansard said it made him think about life with a greater depth of feeling, [...] "with a greater sense of fear and horror and desire than you ever imagined." [...] Colin Larkin credited Morrison for fully realizing his ambition to [...] "create without pop's constraints" [...] on Astral Weeks, while AllMusic's William Ruhlmann said its reputation among critics was justified because [...] "unlike any record before or since," [...] it [...] "encompasses the passion and tenderness that have always mixed in the best postwar popular music".|$|E

His lack of smarts can also be attributed to the hereditary [...] "Simpson Gene", which affects the intelligence of most male members of the Simpson family.
