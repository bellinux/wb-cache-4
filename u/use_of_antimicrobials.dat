40|$|The Health Council of the Netherlands {{has issued}} {{a report on the}} risk of {{development}} of resistance among bacteria as result <b>of</b> the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> antibiotics as growth promotors in livestock farming. The committee appointed by the Health Council conclude that the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> growth promotors contributes to the problem of resistance among human pathogens. The conclusions are based on evidence regarding the development of resistance in livestock as the result <b>of</b> the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> growth promotors, the possibility of colonisation/infection of humans with resistance bacteria from the intestinal flora of productive livestock, and the transfer of resistance genes from livestock bacteria to human pathogenic microorganisms. Effective measures for the limitation of the public health risk should focus on termination <b>of</b> the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> growth promotors that confer resistance to (relate) antibiotics currently used (or which will be available) to treat patients suffering from bacterial infections. In addition, the committee advised ending the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> growth promotors in 3 years...|$|R
50|$|By 2001 this {{practice}} {{had grown so}} much that {{a report by the}} Union of Concerned Scientists found that nearly 90% of the total <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antimicrobials</b> in the United States was for non-therapeutic purposes in agricultural production.|$|E
50|$|With {{increasing}} global {{concern over}} development of antimicrobial resistance, the CVMA {{has taken an}} active role in Canada on the responsible <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antimicrobials.</b> The CVMA has urged the government for further regulatory changes to provide increased veterinary oversight of antibiotic use in Canada. In 2015, the CVMA revised their statement to include a position on <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antimicrobials</b> of high importance in human medicine (VDD Category I to III), stating they should only be used under veterinary oversight with a veterinary prescription. The CVMA, in conjunction with Health Canada and other partner organizations, developed a Therapeutic Decision Cascade for Animal and Public Safety. This document is intended to assist veterinarians in prescribing drugs, including antimicrobials, in a conscientious way for both animals and public health.|$|E

50|$|The {{strain of}} Lactobacillus crispastus was {{originally}} isolated from a pouch in chickens gullet {{and is considered}} {{to be one of the}} strongest H2O2-producing lactobacilli. Like many other Lactobacillus species, it can be severely altered by changes to the immune system, hormone levels and from the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antimicrobials.</b> Lactobacillus crispatus is a normal inhabitant of the lower reproductive tract in healthy women.|$|E
50|$|More recently, {{there has}} been {{increased}} concern {{about the use of}} anti-microbials in animals (including pets, livestock, and companion animals) contributing to the rise in antibiotic resistant infections in humans. The <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antimicrobials</b> has been linked to the rise of resistance in every drug and species where it has been studied, including humans and livestock. However, the role of antibiotic use in food animals - in contrast to the use of antibiotics in humans - in the rise of resistant infections in humans is in dispute. The <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antimicrobials</b> in various forms is widespread throughout animal industry, and is presented as key to preventing animal suffering and economic loss. It is linked by some activist groups to animal welfare concern, large scale commercial agriculture, international food trade, agricultural protectionist laws, environmental protection (including climate change) and other topics, which make the aims of some groups {{on both sides of the}} debate difficult to untangle.|$|E
50|$|In {{a recent}} years, {{antimicrobial}} stewardship teams in hospitals have encouraged optimal <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antimicrobials.</b> The goals of antimicrobial stewardship are to help practitioners {{pick the right}} drug at the right dose and duration of therapy while preventing misuse and minimizing the development of resistance.

40|$|Metals such as mercury, arsenic, {{copper and}} silver {{have been used}} in various forms as <b>antimicrobials</b> for {{thousands}} <b>of</b> years with until recently, little understanding of their mode of action. The discovery of antibiotics and new organic antimicrobial compounds during the twentieth century saw a general decline in the clinical <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> metal compounds, {{with the exception of the}} rediscovery <b>of</b> the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> silver for burns treatments and niche uses for other metal compounds. Antibiotics and new antimicrobials were regarded as being safer for the patient and more effective than the metal-based compounds they supplanted. Bacterial metal ion resistances were first discovered in the second half of the twentieth century. The detailed mechanisms of resistance have now been characterized in a wide range of bacteria. As the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> metals is limited, it is legitimate to ask: are antimicrobial metal resistances in pathogenic and commensal bacteria important now? This review details the new, rediscovered and 'never went away' <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> metals; examines the prevalence and linkage <b>of</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> metal resistance genes to other antimicrobial resistance genes; and examines the evidence for horizontal transfer of these genes between bacteria. Finally, we discuss the possible implications of the widespread dissemination of these resistances on re-emergent <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> metals and how this could impact upon the antibiotic resistance problem...|$|R

50|$|Rising drug {{resistance}} is caused mainly by improper <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antimicrobials</b> in humans {{as well as}} in animals, and spread of resistant strains between the two. Antibiotics increase selective pressure in bacterial populations, causing vulnerable bacteria to die; this increases the percentage of resistant bacteria which continue growing. With resistance to antibiotics becoming more common there is greater need for alternative treatments. Calls for new antibiotic therapies have been issued, but new drug development is becoming rarer.|$|E
50|$|There {{has been}} massive use of {{antibiotics}} in animal husbandry. The most abundant <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antimicrobials</b> worldwide are in livestock; they are typically distributed in animal feed or water for purposes such as disease prevention and growth promotion.Debates have arisen surrounding {{the extent of the}} impact of these antibiotics, particularly antimicrobial growth promoters, on human antibiotic resistance. Although some sources assert that there remains a lack of knowledge on which antibiotic use generates the most risk to humans, policies and regulations have been placed to limit any harmful effects.|$|E

50|$|An {{antimicrobial}} is {{an agent}} that kills microorganisms or stops their growth. Antimicrobial medicines can be grouped {{according to the}} microorganisms they act primarily against. For example, antibiotics are used against bacteria and antifungals are used against fungi. They can also be classified according to their function. Agents that kill microbes are called microbicidal, while those that merely inhibit their growth are called biostatic. The <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> medicines to treat infection is known as antimicrobial chemotherapy, while the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> medicines to prevent infection is known as antimicrobial prophylaxis.|$|R

50|$|The anaerobes often {{recovered}} include Prevotella bivia, Prevotella disiens, and Peptostreptococcus, Porphyromonas and Clostridium spp. Bacteroides fragilis {{group is}} rarely recovered in these infections compared to intra-abdominal infection. Actinomyces spp. and Eubacterium nodatum are often recovered in infections associated with intrauterine devices. Mobiluncus spp. can {{be associated with}} bacterial vaginosis. The aerobic bacteria also found mixed with these anaerobic bacteria include Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus spp. (including groups A and B), Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia spp. and Mycoplasma hominis. Free gas in the tissues, abscess formation and foul-smelling discharge is commonly associated with the presence of anaerobic bacteria. Treatment of these infections includes the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antimicrobials</b> active against all of the potential aerobic and anaerobic bacterial pathogens. Antimicrobials against sexually transmissible pathogens should also be administered.|$|E
50|$|Diagnosis of the {{bacterium}} in humans was traditionally based on clinical findings, {{and culture and}} seriological testing, but false negatives have been a problem due to easy death of P. multocida, and serology cannot differentiate between current infection and previous exposure. The quickest and most accurate method for confirming an active P. multocida infection is molecular detection using polymerase chain reaction.This bacterium can be effectively treated with β-lactam antibiotics, which inhibit cell wall synthesis. It can also be treated with fluoroquinolones or tetracyclines; fluoroquinolones inhibit bacterial DNA synthesis and tetracyclines interfere with protein synthesis by binding to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit. Despite poor in vitro susceptibility results, macrolides (binding to the ribosome) also can be applied, certainly {{in the case of}} pulmonary complications. Due to the polymicrobial etiology of P. multocida infections, treatment requires the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antimicrobials</b> targeted at the elimination of both aerobic and anaerobic, Gram-negative bacteria. As a result, amoxicillin-clavulanate (a beta-lactamase inhibitor/penicillin combination) is seen as the treatment of choice.|$|E

50|$|Antimicrobial {{stewardship}} (AMS) is {{the systematic}} effort {{to educate and}} persuade prescribers of antimicrobials to follow evidence-based prescribing, in order to stem antibiotic overuse, and thus antimicrobial resistance. AMS has been an organized effort of specialists in infectious diseases,both in Internal Medicine and Pediatrics with their respective peer-organizations, hospital pharmacists, the public health community and their professional organizations since the late 1990s. It has first been implemented in hospitals. In the U.S., {{within the context of}} physicians' prescribing freedom (choice of prescription drugs), AMS has largely been voluntary self-regulation in the form of policies and appeals to adhere to a prescribing self-discipline. At hospitals, this may take the form of an antimicrobial stewardship program. As of 2014, only the state of California has made this type of AMS mandatory by law. Within the context of commercial and over-the-counter <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antimicrobials,</b> legally mandated AMS has begun with FDA rules that triclosan be phased out of consumer-grade soaps due to lack of good evidence that such use improves public health.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Treatment of {{mastitis}} {{should be}} based on bacteriological diagnosis and take national and international guidelines on prudent <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antimicrobials</b> into account. In acute mastitis, where bacteriological diagnosis is not available, treatment should be initiated based on herd data and personal experience. Rapid bacteriological diagnosis would facilitate the proper selection of the antimicrobial. Treating subclinical mastitis with antimicrobials during lactation is seldom economical, because of high treatment costs and generally poor efficacy. All mastitis treatment should be evidence-based, i. e., the efficacy of each product and treatment length should be demonstrated by scientific studies. Use of on-farm written protocols for mastitis treatment promotes a judicious <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antimicrobials</b> and reduces the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antimicrobials.</b> </p...|$|E
40|$|Strategies {{to improve}} the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antimicrobials</b> and to limit the {{acquisition}} and spread of resistance are of paramount importance and may influence directly the epidemiology of nosocomial infections. The increasing incidence of nosocomial infections is strongly related to both suboptimal <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antimicrobials</b> and poor compliance with optimal patient care practices. Cross-transmission of resistant bacteria in hospitals results from poor adherence to infection control measures such as hand hygiene and standard precautions, and leads to an increasing reservoir of resistant organisms, that further facilitate the development of resistance. The strategies proposed in this review target both the appropriate <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antimicrobials</b> in order to decrease resistance acquisition, and improvements in health care practices to reduce cross-transmission...|$|E
40|$|The <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> {{agents in}} food animals has caused concern {{regarding}} the impact these uses have on human health. <b>Use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antimicrobial</b> agents in {{animals and humans}} results in the emergence and dissemina-tion of resistant bacteria. Resistant bacteria from food animals may be passed through the food chain to hu-mans resulting in resistant infections. Increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents {{that are important in}} the treatment of human diseases, such as fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins for the treatment of Salmonella and Campylobacter infections, has significant public health implications.
