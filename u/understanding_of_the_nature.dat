5|$|Greek mythology is {{the body}} of myths and teachings that belong to the ancient Greeks, {{concerning}} their gods and heroes, {{the nature of the}} world, and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices. It {{was a part of the}} religion in ancient Greece. Modern scholars refer to and study the myths in an attempt to shed light on the religious and political institutions of ancient Greece and its civilization, and to gain <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of myth-making itself.|$|E
5|$|In the {{clinical}} sense, a disorder {{is a condition}} requiring treatment as opposed to risk factors for subsequent disorders. There {{is a lack of}} consensus about the precise meaning of the term 'attachment disorder' although there is general agreement that such disorders only arise following early adverse caregiving experiences. Reactive attachment disorder indicates the absence of either or both the main aspects of proximity seeking to an identified attachment figure. This can occur either in institutions, or with repeated changes of caregiver, or from extremely neglectful primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs after the age of 6 months. Current official classifications of RAD under DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10 are largely based on this <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of attachment.|$|E
5|$|Neon {{played a}} role in the basic <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of atoms in 1913, when J. J. Thomson, as part of his {{exploration}} into the composition of canal rays, channeled streams of neon ions through a magnetic and an electric field and measured the deflection of the streams with a photographic plate. Thomson observed two separate patches of light on the photographic plate (see image), which suggested two different parabolas of deflection. Thomson eventually concluded that some of the atoms in the neon gas were of higher mass than the rest. Though not understood at the time by Thomson, this was the first discovery of isotopes of stable atoms. Thomson's device was a crude version of the instrument we now term a mass spectrometer.|$|E
40|$|This study investigates learners‟ <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> {{scientific}} inquiry (NOSI) {{in relation to}} their classroom experiences. Using <b>the</b> constructs <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> of {{scientific inquiry}}; inquiry-based teaching and learning; and principles of scientific inquiry as theoretical lenses, the study empirically explored learners‟ (n = 120) <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> scientific inquiry which were captured through a questionnaire called Learners‟ <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> science and scientific inquiry (LUSSI) and interviews and their perceptions of classroom inquiry (their experiences of inquiry were elicited through a questionnaire called Principles of scientific inquiry- student (PSI-S) and interviews). The participants were one hundred and twenty learners, 60 from each of two schools in an Education District in Lesotho. Eight learners, four from each school participated in the interviews. At the centre, the investigation sought to understand whether there was any relationship between learners‟ perceptions of their experiences of scientific inquiry and their <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> scientific inquiry. As a result, this study was guided by the following questions: what are learners‟ <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> scientific inquiry? What are learners‟ perceptions of their experiences of scientific inquiry? Are learners‟ <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> NOSI in any way related to their experiences of scientific inquiry? Typological approach was used to analyse the qualitative data and descriptive statistics for analysing the quantitative data. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> this study suggest that learners hold less informed <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> scientific inquiry and that learners are experiencing closed-inquiry in their science classroom. The results also show that other learners‟ experiences of scientific inquiry are not related to their <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> scientific inquiry. It was recommended that teachers should engage learners in inquiry activities rather than always carrying out teacher-demonstrations. It is also recommended that further studies should be done in Lesotho {{to examine the relationship between}} learners‟ <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> NOSI and their perceptions of their classroom experiences...|$|R

There is considerable debate about the most appropriate way to introduce novice programmers to object-oriented concepts.

5|$|Palmyra's {{society was}} {{a mixture of}} the {{different}} peoples inhabiting the city, which is seen in Aramaic, Arabic and Amorite clan names. Palmyra was a tribal community but {{due to the lack of}} sources, an <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of Palmyrene tribal structure is not possible. Thirty clans have been documented; five of which were identified as tribes (Phyle (φυλή)) comprising several sub-clans. By the time of Nero Palmyra had four tribes, each residing in an area of the city bearing its name. Three of the tribes were the Komare, Mattabol and Ma'zin; the fourth tribe is uncertain, but was probably the Mita. In time, the four tribes became highly civic and tribal lines blurred; by the second century clan identity lost its importance, and it disappeared during the third century. Even the four tribes ceased to be important by the third century as only one inscription mentions a tribe after the year 212; instead, aristocrats played the decisive role in the city's social organization. During the Umayyad period Palmyra was mainly inhabited by the Kalb tribe. Benjamin of Tudela recorded the existence of 2,000 Jews in the city during the twelfth century. Palmyra declined after its destruction by Timur in 1400, and was a village of 6,000 inhabitants at the beginning of the 20th century; although surrounded by Bedouin, the villagers preserved their dialect. Palmyra maintained the life of a small settlement until its relocation in 1932.|$|E

25|$|The fused BCR-ABL protein {{interacts with}} the {{interleukin}} 3beta(c) receptor subunit. The BCR-ABL transcript is continuously active and does not require activation by other cellular messaging proteins. In turn, BCR-ABL activates a cascade of proteins that control the cell cycle, speeding up cell division. Moreover, the BCR-ABL protein inhibits DNA repair, causing genomic instability and making the cell more susceptible to developing further genetic abnormalities. The action of the BCR-ABL protein is the pathophysiologic cause of chronic myelogenous leukemia. With improved <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of the BCR-ABL protein and its action as a tyrosine kinase, targeted therapies (the first of which was imatinib) that specifically inhibit {{the activity of the}} BCR-ABL protein have been developed.

25|$|According {{to general}} relativity, {{gravitational}} radiation is generated {{in situations where}} the curvature of spacetime is oscillating, such {{as is the case}} with co-orbiting objects. The gravitational radiation emitted by the Solar System is far too small to measure. However, gravitational radiation has been indirectly observed as an energy loss over time in binary pulsar systems such as PSR B1913+16. It is believed that neutron star mergers and black hole formation may create detectable amounts of gravitational radiation. Gravitational radiation observatories such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) have been created to study the problem. In February 2016, the Advanced LIGO team announced that they had detected gravitational waves from a black hole collision. On 14 September 2015, LIGO registered gravitational waves for the first time, as a result of the collision of two black holes 1.3 billion light-years from Earth. This observation confirms the theoretical predictions of Einstein and others that such waves exist. The event confirms that binary black holes exist. It also opens the way for practical observation and <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of gravity and events in the Universe including the Big Bang and what happened after it.|$|E
