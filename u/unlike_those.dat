5|$|The flight deck, <b>unlike</b> <b>those</b> on Royal Navy carriers, was {{superimposed}} on the ship's hull rather than constructed as a strength deck supporting the carrier's hull structure. A system {{of lights and}} mirrors along the flight deck assisted pilots in landing on the carrier.|$|E
5|$|Amy is a playable {{character}} in Sonic Advance 1, 2 and 3, platformers for the Game Boy Advance. With Sonic, Tails, Knuckles and (in the latter 2 games) Cream, she frees animals from inside Eggman's robots {{to keep him}} from building an empire. Although in Sonic Advance Amy's attacking power was restricted by her inability to spin while jumping (<b>unlike</b> <b>those</b> of the other characters), this was changed in the latter two games.|$|E

50|$|The Council's work is {{considered}} secret, and is done outside the public's eye. Its authority is vague and the Prime Minister is not obligated to accept its recommendations, <b>unlike</b> with <b>those</b> of the Attorney General, for example.|$|R
5|$|As in all insects, {{the body}} {{is divided into three}} sections: the head, thorax, and abdomen. The thorax is {{composed}} of three segments, each with a pair of legs. In most families of butterfly the antennae are clubbed, <b>unlike</b> <b>those</b> of moths which may be threadlike or feathery. The long proboscis can be coiled when not in use for sipping nectar from flowers.|$|E
5|$|Dialects of {{killer whales}} not only {{distinguish}} them between pods, but also between types. Resident dialects contain seven to 17 (mean = 11) distinctive call types. All {{members of the}} North American west coast transient community express the same basic dialect, although minor regional variation in call types is evident. Preliminary research indicates offshore killer whales have group-specific dialects <b>unlike</b> <b>those</b> of residents and transients.|$|E
5|$|Downtown Boston's streets grew organically, {{so they do}} {{not form}} a planned grid, <b>unlike</b> <b>those</b> in later-developed Back Bay, East Boston, the South End, and South Boston. Boston is the eastern {{terminus}} of I-90, which in Massachusetts runs along the Massachusetts Turnpike. The elevated portion of the Central Artery, which carried most of the through traffic in downtown Boston, was replaced with the O'Neill Tunnel during the Big Dig, substantially completed in early 2006.|$|E

50|$|Some {{studies have}} found that Arab {{practices}} of endogamous marriage also benefitted elder sons and their lines of descent over younger sons and their lines of descent, thus contradicting the idea that in Arab societies, <b>unlike</b> in <b>those</b> of Inner Asia, fraternal birth order played no role at all in family relationships.|$|R
5000|$|In 2011, Brigadier General Ramona Go, from San Dionisio, Iloilo, {{became the}} first female general in the Philippine Army after being a regular officer.

5|$|Ganesha is {{a popular}} figure in Indian art. <b>Unlike</b> <b>those</b> of some deities, {{representations}} of Ganesha show wide variations and distinct patterns changing over time. He may be portrayed standing, dancing, heroically taking action against demons, playing with his family as a boy, sitting down or on an elevated seat, or engaging {{in a range of}} contemporary situations.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{majority}} of medieval cathedrals, those of England are cruciform. While most are of the Latin Cross shape with a single transept, several including Salisbury, Lincoln, Wells and Canterbury have two transepts, which is a distinctly English characteristic. The transepts, <b>unlike</b> <b>those</b> of many French cathedrals, always project strongly. The cathedral, whether of monastic or secular foundation, often has several clearly defined subsidiary buildings, in particular the chapter house and cloister.|$|E
5|$|Male crickets {{establish}} their dominance {{over each other}} by aggression. They start by lashing each other with their antennae and flaring their mandibles. Unless one retreats at this stage, they resort to grappling, {{at the same time}} each emitting calls that are quite <b>unlike</b> <b>those</b> uttered in other circumstances. When one achieves dominance, it sings loudly, while the loser remains silent.|$|E
5|$|During {{the decade}} of the 530s, it seemed to many that God had {{abandoned}} the Christian Roman Empire. There were noxious fumes in the air; and the Sun, while still providing day, refused to give much heat. This caused famine <b>unlike</b> anything <b>those</b> of the time had seen before, weakening the people of Europe and the Middle East.|$|R

5|$|Omaha's rate {{of violent}} crimes per 100,000 {{residents}} has been {{lower than the}} average rates of three dozen United States cities of similar size. <b>Unlike</b> Omaha, <b>those</b> cities have experienced an increase in violent crime overall since 2003. Rates for property crime have decreased for both Omaha and its peer cities {{during the same time}} period. In 2006, Omaha was ranked for homicides as 46th out of the 72 cities in the United States of more than 250,000 in population.|$|R
5|$|The fungal {{cell wall}} is {{composed}} of glucans and chitin; while glucans are also found in plants and chitin in the exoskeleton of arthropods, fungi are the only organisms that combine these two structural molecules in their cell wall. <b>Unlike</b> <b>those</b> of plants and oomycetes, fungal cell walls do not contain cellulose.|$|E
5|$|The {{two small}} upper {{register}} panels show a rather traditional Annunciation scene, {{with the usual}} dove representing the Holy Spirit near Mary. The two sets of panels, <b>unlike</b> <b>those</b> on the interior, are compositionally very different. The figures occupy distinctly separate niches and the colour schemes of the grisaille saints and donors contrast sharply.|$|E
5|$|Wulfred was {{the first}} {{archbishop}} to place his portrait on the pennies struck in his name which, <b>unlike</b> <b>those</b> of previous archbishops, never made reference to the ruling Mercian king. Wulfred also rebuilt some buildings at Christ Church, Canterbury, {{although it is not}} known whether these were support buildings, such as the dormitory and refractory, or if he rebuilt the cathedral itself.|$|E
40|$|Representational {{theories}} of consciousness {{can be understood}} as supporting Brentano’s thesis, that intentionality is the mark of the mental, since they seek to explain consciousness in terms of the representational features of the brain. <b>Unlike</b> Brentano, however, <b>those</b> who support these theories are generally physicalists...|$|R
50|$|In contrast, {{people can}} also exhibit {{characteristics}} of low uncertainty avoidance. <b>Unlike</b> high UA, <b>those</b> {{with a low}} level use informality in interaction with others, they often rely on informal norms and behaviors in most matters. Also, they will show moderate resistance to change.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT- Based {{on their}} own {{experience}} and on the literature, the authors compare the brain pathology due to HIV+ associated Trypanosoma cruzi reactived infection to that described for {{the natural history of}} the Chagas’ disease (CD). The peculiar focal necrotizing chagasic meningoencephalitis (MECNF) which appears only in immunedeficient chagasics, especially when the deficiency is due HIV is a safe criterion for reactivation of CD. MECNF morphologic findings are <b>unlike</b> to <b>those</b> found either for some cases of acute phase CD or for chronic nervous form of CD...|$|R
5|$|As {{pointed out}} by Jack Bailey (1997), the spines resembled those of sail-bearing pelycosaurs like Dimetrodon. According to Bailey, Amargasaurus might also have possessed such a sail, {{which might have been}} used for display. <b>Unlike</b> <b>those</b> of pelycosaurs, the neural spines of Amargasaurus were bifurcated, forming a double row along the neck and back. As the space between both rows was merely , the {{existence}} of two parallel sails seems unlikely. Instead, Bailey suggested the spines represented a scaffold which was completely enveloped by a single skin. Paul argued against the sail hypothesis, noting that neck sails would have reduced neck flexion, and that the spines were circular in cross-section rather than flattened {{as is the case in}} sail-bearing animals.|$|E
5|$|Hazel: The {{daughter}} of the two lead characters, born in the first issue, who occasionally narrates the series. She has wings like her mother, horns like her father, and green-brown eyes <b>unlike</b> <b>those</b> of either of her parents. She spends most of her childhood {{growing up in the}} organic tree-like rocketship with which she and her parents escape Cleave. She is seen taking her first steps {{at the end of the}} third story arc, and is speaking in simple phrases by the beginning of the fourth. She celebrates her fourth birthday in the sixth story arc, during a part of her life when she and her grandmother are being held in a Landfallian detention center.|$|E
5|$|He {{describes}} {{the range of}} species in each group in some detail, concluding that the birds are <b>unlike</b> <b>those</b> {{of any of the}} surrounding countries and are quite isolated, but are related to those of distant places including New Guinea, Australia, India and Africa; he thinks there is nowhere else where so many such species occur in one place. Similarly in the Nymphalidae (he mentions the English member, the purple emperor butterfly), there are 48 species of which 35 are endemic to Celebes. He concludes that the Celebes group of islands is a major faunal division of the archipelago.|$|E
50|$|Another {{measure of}} divorces is the divorce to {{marriage}} ratio, {{which is the}} number of divorces to the number of marriages in a given year (the ratio of the crude divorce rate to the crude marriage rate). For example, if there are 550 divorces and 1,000 marriages in a given year in a given area, the ratio would be one divorce for every two marriages, e.g. a ratio of 0.55 (55%). However, this measurement compares two <b>unlike</b> populations, <b>those</b> who can marry and those who can divorce.|$|R

50|$|The Church of the Ascension, {{like many}} {{churches in the}} {{continuing}} Anglican movement, began {{with a group of}} people who were dissatisfied with the direction of the Episcopal Church.

5|$|It {{was also}} {{suggested}} that the Kir'Shara itself was similar in context to the Nag Hammadi library, which was a collection of thirteen codices found in Nag Hammadi, Egypt, in 1945 that date back to between the 2nd to 5th centuries. <b>Unlike</b> <b>those</b> codices, the Vulcan High Council attempts to suppress the revelation of the Kir'Shara {{in a similar manner}} to the Catholic Church's suppression seen in other fictional works such as Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code or James Redfield's The Celestine Prophecy.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many species}} of spider, a P. schultzi lays a {{continuous}} dragline of silk as it moves, {{and from time to}} time anchors the dragline to a surface with a spot of sticky silk. This allows the spider to return to the surface if the animal is dislodged. A spider about to jump first lays a sticky silk anchor, and then lays out a dragline as it flies. <b>Unlike</b> <b>those</b> of most jumping spiders, P. schultzi′s draglines stick to each other and, when a P. schultzi has laid a few lines across a gap, it uses these as walkways and reinforces them with additional silk as it moves.|$|E
5|$|Most middle {{aged and}} young women in urban Maharashtra dress in western outfits such as skirts and {{trousers}} or shalwar kameez with the traditionally nauvari or nine-yard sari, disappearing from the markets {{due to a lack}} of demand. Older women wear the five-yard sari. Traditionally, Brahmin women in Maharashtra, <b>unlike</b> <b>those</b> of other castes, did not cover their head with the end of their saree. In urban areas, the five-yard sari is worn by younger women for special occasions such as marriages and religious ceremonies. Maharashtrian brides prefer the very Maharashtrian saree – the Paithani – for their wedding day.|$|E

Robert the Magnificent was a great friend to them, and his death on his pilgrimage made their abode in Normandy far less peaceful and secure.|$|R
50|$|Officials {{with the}} T are hoping the new rail line will entice non-T member cities {{along the line}} to join the transit agency in its quest to become a {{regional}} transit entity. Cities along the route include Colleyville, Haltom City and North Richland Hills. The route also goes through small parts of Hurst and Southlake. <b>Unlike</b> Grapevine, <b>those</b> cities do not have room under the state-mandated 8.25% sales tax cap for the 1/2 cent need to join. The T will not build a station along the line in those cities unless they become a member city first.|$|R
