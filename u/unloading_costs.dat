In our framework, we assume the routing of a consignment to be given, which turns out that there is an order of unloading items with respect to the consignment. If we load items without considering the order of unloading items, we may unload and reload other unconcerned items drastically while unloading the required item.

In order to save <b>unloading</b> <b>costs</b> tipper trucks are becoming very popular now a day. These bodies are also known as dump bodies. These are useful in {{a simple way to}} unload the material. Every extra pound of vehicle weight increases manufacturing cost, lower fuel efficiency and reduces vehicle payload capacity. With this concept of reducing weight and stress reduction the optimized model of tipper dump body is modeled and analyzed. Three models of tipper dump bodies are considered, whose specifications are taken from local industry. The three models are modeled in CAD package Pro-E and Static Structural analysis is done in ANSYS. The three models are 14 cubic meter capacity and bearing cubic load of 18 tons. By conducting the Finite Element Analysis on the three Models and according to standards, weight reduction and stress reduction is carried out. With the optimized parameters, optimized Model is developed and analyzed, stress analysis is carried out and the results are obtained.

40|$|Due to the {{intensified}} {{globalization of}} world economies, containerized liner trades have been steadily growing {{since the early}} 1990 s. However, more than 50 years after containerized shipping was extended to international trades, the industry is still struggling {{with the problem of}} how to manage empty containers. On one hand, this industry is highly dynamic and unstable, with a constant ebb and flow in supply and demand for containers. On the other hand, trades are typically imbalanced in terms of the numbers of inbound and outbound containers, especially on the arterial East-West trade routes. To alleviate the effects of uncertainty and trade imbalance, ocean carriers are pressurized to seek effective policies to rationalize empty container movement. This paper considers the dynamic empty container reposition problem for a network of transhipment services in a random setting. The objective is for ocean carriers to minimize the finite horizon total expected empty container operational cost, comprising the transportation <b>cost,</b> the <b>unloading</b> <b>cost,</b> the loading cost, the holding cost and the leasing cost. The decisions in the model include when and where we need to reposition how many empty containers, and the number of leased containers needed to meet customers’ demand over time. The randomness arises from the demands for and the supplies of empty containers. The problem is formulated using chance constrained programming approach. For this special case, an inequality constraint containing random parameters can be transformed into chance constraint and further reduced to a deterministic programming problem. According to the principle of chance constrained programming approach, a probability level or service level is specified, with which the decisions feasibility can be guaranteed. Numerical tests are conducted to evaluate the model validity and to investigate the effects of different factors on both decisions and cost results...|$|R

To tackle this problem, two mathematical programming models and one heuristic algorithm are suggested. Chapter I addresses a naphtha feeding problem for Naphtha Cracking Center (NCC). The rapid increase of petroleum prices compelled to petro-chemical industries to {{figure out ways to}} remove any potential redundancies in and out of their network. The increasing attention on integrating activities that have been addressed separately is in line with this trend. The naphtha feeding problem involves two key operations: delivering naphtha from refineries to NCC and blending naphtha in storage tanks before feeding it to NCC. While the first is concerned with selection sources and scheduling the loading and unloading of naphtha, the latter involves the transfer of the naphtha from storage tanks to a charging tank. The both issues are simultaneously considered by transforming them into a single mixed integer linear programming problem of minimizing the cost function of naphtha prices, shipping expenses, and <b>unloading</b> <b>costs,</b> etc. A numerical example of a real industrial case is presented to illustrate the applicability of the proposed mathematical model. In Chapter II, we propose a decision-supporting framework for a feeding problem in the petrochemical industry. The problem is concerned with delivering materials from suppliers to plants, unloading and storing in storage tanks, and mixing the materials before directly feeding into main processes. Most of the previous works in the literature have addressed these concepts, {{based on the assumption that}} the delivery of raw materials is given and fixed. From a joint investigation with industry partners, we have determined that the purchase of feedstock and its delivery also are critical issues in the feed scheduling problem of real-world plants. Thereafter, we takes into account previously addressed issues separately and simultaneously, to increase the overall efficiency. The corresponding decision-making problem is mathematically transformed to a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. The solution of the problem is computed using the iterative framework between that of a relaxed mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem and that of a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem, to prevent compositional discrepancy. An industry-coworked example of the naphtha case is presented, to illustrate the applicability of the proposed framework. In Chapter III, a heuristic method is developed to address the unloading and blending scheduling problem in NCC. This method is based on the rules which are applied to mange tanks in NCC. By applying this method, the massive scheduling problem is successfully solved in a short time compared to the mathematical programming method. By simulating the schedule solution generated with the proposed method, site-operators can estimate the long-term plans (vessel arrival events) predetermined by the head quarter. If the simulation shows the bad results, site-operators can require that the predetermined long-term plans should be modified in order to maintain NCC at stable and efficient condition. This is the additional advantage to apply the proposed method...|$|E

40|$|In {{terms of}} efficiency, road {{transport}} operations have historically seen very little development {{relative to other}} supply chain areas and some authors have even referred to freight transportation as the “forgotten factor. ” Several studies world-wide have shown a generally low level of efficiency in road transport operations. The U. S. Department of Transportation published a report in 2008 on the costs of inefficiencies in road transport operations, stating that inefficiencies related to, e. g., loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>cost</b> the nation’s road transport operators over 3 billion USD annually. The literature discusses the various efficiency issues in road transport operations, in areas such as, i. e., route planning, organization, routines at loading and unloading and efficiency issues related to security initiatives and wasteful operations. Waste corresponds to everything (resources, time, activities, etc.) that does not add value, e. g., waiting, defects and unnecessary administration. Due to the large environmental and societal impact of transport operations, interest and legislation from authorities and societies is mounting on supply chain members involved in freight transportation to increase operational efficiency. Previous literature has proposed that information deficiency is a reason for inefficiency and has pointed to information sharing (an overarching term involving the adaptation of processes, information and enabling technology) to improve efficiency, yet it is unclear both how to address waste in road transport operations and how information sharing can improve efficiency and the potential of it. This thesis addresses those questions with the focus “to explore and define waste in road transport operations and estimate the efficiency potential of information sharing. ” The findings of this thesis are relevant for industry, academia and policy-makers. This thesis brings the attention of managers to the various other types of waste prevalent in road transport operations and provides frameworks that are useful in addressing waste in a structured fashion. The drivers’ working time is the biggest individual cost for road transport operators and even minor reductions of waste of drivers’ working time can enable significant cost savings. The academic contribution is definitions on waste, a conceptual framework of information sharing, insights on supply chain transport relationships and quantification of the potential of information sharing. Several authorities are now investing in research and creating roadmaps on how investments in Information Communication Technologies (ICT) can improve efficiency of road transport operations.

IBP uptake by MSM- 500 was thermodynamically favorable at room temperature, which was interpreted as indicating relatively weak bonding because the entropy (∆adsS, - 0. 07 J mol(- 1) K(- 1)) was much smaller. Five times recycling tests revealed that MSM- 500 had 83 - 87 % recovery efficiencies and slower uptake speeds due to slight deformation of the outer pore structure.

40|$|Fruits and {{vegetables}} are damaged due to inappropriate methods of picking, packing, Storage and transportation. They perish during this process. Insufficient information Flow is another major handicap. Therefore {{it is very important}} to study the whole Supply chain and find out the necessary remedies in order to develop Sri Lankan fruit and vegetable industry. The main objective of this research is to study the whole supply chain of fruit & Vegetable industry, to identify the weak links of the supply chain and to identify the Improvements in order to maximize profit for the growers and minimize cost to the consumer. This research is also aimed to identify the extent of fruit {{and vegetables}} damaged by The methods of wrong handling, storage and packaging. And also to identify the gaps and necessary improvements for fruit & vegetables supply chain using the Supply Chain Operation Reference model (SCOR). The major component of this research is mapping the total supply chain thread for Fruit and vegetable industry in Sri Lanka in order to fulfill all the objectives. This Research targets few selected fruits and vegetables and map the supply chain threads. Mapping the supply chain threads for banana, lime, papaya, jack fruit and tomato Were mammoth tasks. Each fruit and vegetable has different supply chain thread Depending on the geographical and climate conditions, these threads change. Total damage and perishing of fruits and vegetables in the supply chain depend on the supply chain thread and also it varies according to the method of handling, packing and transport. By selecting papaya supply chain thread: farmer - truck buyer - retailer- consumer, the percentage damage was analyzed, by wrapping in papers and packing in boxes gave different percentage damages. If plastic crates are introduced thus minimizing or eliminating damages in total supply chain, it can recover the initial investment within one and half months. If the initial investment was done by the truck buyer they have to wait for four and half months to recover the initial investment and this is on the assumption that the truck buyer can charge additional 50 cents per kilogram if they use plastic crates as method of packing. Due. to reluctance of the chain partners to invest, there should be some financial incentives to initiate this packing method and it will result in significant benefits to the total supply chain. After mapping the supply chain for papaya, banana, lime, jack fruit and tomato as at present, and by studying the supply chain in best performing sector and super markets, the main component missing is Plan Supply Chain (PI). Plan Source (P 2), Plan Make (P 3),Plan Deliver (P 4) are there to some extent in the chain partners but Planning Supply Chain as a whole (PI) is absent. Decoupling Point (DP) in Sri Lankan super market sector is at the distribution center and for other chains DP is at the retailers that are close to the consumer. Chain members were found to take considerable time to move their inventory. This is the cause for a large percentage perishing, since this fruit and vegetable life time is short and if this time period is not managed properly it will cause problems. Integrated collection and transportation system to plan and manage by central unit is the answer, and then it could be arranged for daily collection and distribution network. In banana and papaya supply chain, wholesalers' role is relatively small and because of their handling time of extra two days, it causes an increase in the percentage of perishing and damage, adding further cost to consumer. If in the supply chain, truck buyers directly deal with the retailer, this damage percentage can be reduced and can also reduce transportation cost. Since individual retailers at present make arrangements of transportation which is costly, it is preferred for the truck buyer to develop integrated distribution network. This will reduce the transportation costs to a great extent. In all supply chains, the maximum profit margin is kept by the retailers. Then comes the wholesalers own high profit margins. Farmers take higher profit once they sell their products to the consumer at the fair, but quantity involved in this chain is comparatively low. Transportation and overheads cost component of the supermarket supply chain is comparatively high and the cost due to damage is low compared to the other supply chains. However since supermarket supply chain manages quality of the fruit and vegetable, consumers who enjoy high living standard are willing to buy from them and pay an additional amount. When analyzing the price breakdown for supply chain threads for fruits and vegetables in this research, the maximum portion was found to be the profit component, second came costs due to damage/ perishing and thirdly basic production cost. Around one fifth portion is only the amount for the cost of production for these 'fruit and vegetable items and the balance part of what the consumer pays consists of the profit, cost due to damage, transportation cost, packaging <b>cost,</b> loading <b>unloading</b> <b>cost</b> and overheads...|$|R

The purpose {{is to develop a}} model that will calculate and present possible cost savings for the customer by using Volvo Logistics Corporations, VLC’s, returnable packaging instead of other packaging solutions. The thesis is based on qualitative data gained from both theoretical and empirical studies. The methodology for gaining information has been to study theoretical sources such as course literature and articles, as well as through interviews and consolidation with staff at Volvo Logistics Corporations office in Gothenburg. The model is constructed in Microsoft Excel and consists of six different sheets. The first sheet is a front page that summarises the costs calculated in the other sheets and presents the possible cost savings. After the front page there are three sheets with calculations for the costs in different scenarios, Today’s Situation, VLC Packaging Solution (Pre implementation) and VLC Packaging Solution (Post implementation). The first sheet, Today’s Situation, presents the result of the model that will calculate the customers’ current costs that are associated with packaging. The different costs presented in the model are <b>costs</b> for <b>unloading,</b> repacking, today’s <b>cost</b> for an internal packaging solution, quality related costs, one-way packaging costs and the costs for other packaging solutions. The next sheet, VLC Packaging Solution (Pre), presents an estimation of the cost for thecustomer when using VLC’s returnable packaging system. The estimation will serve as an investment tool, for calculating possible cost savings compared to the present situation. The different costs that will be discussed are handling costs, quality related costs, distribution cost, transaction cost, and investment cost. The third and final calculation sheet, VLC Packaging Solution (Post), presents the actual costs for the customer after the implementation. When the costs have been calculated they will be used to evaluate the actual cost savings for the customer. The last two sheets are a data sheet, which consists of data needed for the calculations in the previous sheets, and an instruction sheet where there are instructions to the different calculations in the model. The conclusion shows that the objective to create a model for calculating the costs for different packaging systems and present possible cost savings is fulfilled...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in selected major vegetable producing Tabias of Klite- Awlaelo woreda namely Genfel, Mesanu, A/ksanded, and Aynalem. The study aims at assessing the major constraints and opportunities to improve vegetable production and marketing. The data collection was conducted in October 2007. A survey was conducted using structured interview schedule to collect primary data from 162 vegetables producers and 30 officials of the woreda and cooperatives. Different types of vegetables are grown in the study area under irrigated conditions. The most commonly grown vegetables {{in terms of the number}} of growers are potato, cabbage, onion, carrot and tomato. Onion, potato and tomato which are the major vegetables cultivated in the woreda were considered for the study. House holds uses family labour for land preparation, planting, cultivation, weeding, irrigation, fertilizer application, pesticides application, harvesting and transporting of the products to the market. Farmers in the study area used organic manure to improve the production of vegetables. Vegetables are produced in some specific locations in the eastern part of Tigray and supplied to the local markets. The major markets identified for collection and distribution of large quantities of vegetables are at Wukro and Mekelle. The market actors namely producers, collectors, brokers, transporters, traders, and consumers play different roles along the market chain. Most producers in the study area are intending to expand vegetable production. The most commonly mentioned opportunities are related to market demand, proximity to the market, better price, irrigation facility and government support. The constraints of vegetable production viewed from the farmers’ perspective are: institutional factors, natural factors and transportation related factors. Inadequate farmer skills and knowledge of production, product management and attack of pests and diseases are the most common constraints of vegetable production. In cash crop production, households decide which cash crop(s) to grow and at which market(s) to sell their crop harvests. Different market outlets that households may consider are selling at the farm-gate, selling at a local market or selling at a central market. Chi-square model was used to examine the interaction between crop and market outlet choices in the study area. The result shows the existence of statistical evidence that market outlet choice and quantity produced with respect to Potato, Onion and Tomato are associated. Vegetable production is increasing from time to time in the woreda. The output and productivity of vegetables, is affected by the different factors. Therefore multiple regression analysis was used to identify the factors which influence the productivity of vegetable products in the study area. The results show that availability of extension services, oxen, labour and fertilizer utilization positively influenced vegetable production. But it is influenced negatively by the cultivated size of land. The production cost of onion, potato and tomato was 73. 8 birr, 58. 4 birr, and 57. 7 birr per quintal respectively. This cost excludes the marketing cost such as transportation <b>cost,</b> loading and <b>unloading,</b> and other <b>costs.</b> During the survey time, the profit of onion per ha was far better when compared to the others. The price of vegetables in the study area is unstable. When compared to onion and potato, the price of tomatoes was found more unstable (the variation in prices around mean was 32 %). Farmers in the study area use donkey, car and local carts to transport their produces to the market. They used ordinary rooms for storage of their produces with ground/soil floor and with no shelves. Farmers are not aware about the price of their agricultural commodities before they arrive at market. As the result of this, farmers get lower price for the agricultural commodities. Multipurpose cooperatives do not significantly support the vegetable growers in the study area. The study points out to the need of effective interventions of multipurpose cooperatives to support and train the vegetable growers. Sound policies favouring vegetable cultivators and related rural agro-based industries are necessary conditions for rural poverty reduction, and for coping with domestic competition in the home market. Therefore government with the support of official donors and the multilateral institutions should help technically and financially the vegetable growers to increase productivity, to diversify production, to add value through processing, to provide the farmers a greater share of the final value of products through improved marketing, and to achieve environmental sustainability. Providing access to credit for the vegetable cultivators, improving marketing infrastructure especially improved storage and transportation facilities, providing technical guidance and training opportunities in processing and post-harvest technologies, supply of improved and quality seed material for increased production, extension efforts for plant protection, ensuring the availability of market information and adopting a group and participatory approach for vegetable production and marketing are the areas which need immediate attention...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} few years the nuclear {{industry}} has used concerns about climate change to argue for a nuclear revival. Although industry representatives may have convinced some political leaders that this is a good idea, there is little evidence of private capital investing in nuclear plants in competitive electricity markets. The reason is simple: nuclear power is uneconomical. In an excellent recent analysis, "The Nuclear Illusion," Amory B. Lovins and Imran Sheikh put the cost of electricity from a new nuclear power plant at 14 -cents per kilowatt hour and that from a wind farm at 7 -cents per kilowatt hour. This comparison includes the costs of fuel, capital, operations and maintenance, and transmission and distribution. It does not include the additional costs for nuclear of disposing of waste, insuring plants against an accident, and decommissioning the plants when they wear out. Given this huge gap, the so-called nuclear revival can succeed only by <b>unloading</b> these <b>costs</b> onto taxpayers. If all the costs of generating nuclear electricity are included in the price to consumers, nuclear power is dead in the water. To {{get a sense of the}} costs of nuclear waste disposal, we need not look beyond the United States, which leads the world with 101, 000 megawatts of nuclear-generating capacity (compared with 63, 000 megawatts in second-ranked France). The United States proposes to store the radioactive waste from its 104 nuclear power reactors in the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, roughly 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada. The cost of this repository, originally estimated at $ 58 billion in 2001, climbed to $ 96 billion by 2008. This comes to a staggering $ 923 million per reactor [...] almost $ 1 billion each [...] assuming no further repository cost increases. In addition to being over budget, the repository is 19 years behind schedule. Originally slated to start accepting waste in 1998, it is now set to do so in 2017, assuming it clears all remaining hurdles. This leaves nuclear waste in storage in 121 temporary facilities in 39 states [...] sites that are vulnerable both to leakage and to terrorist attacks. One of the risks of nuclear power is a catastrophic accident like the one at Chernobyl in Russia. The Price-Anderson Act, first enacted by Congress in 1957, shelters U. S. utilities with nuclear power plants from the cost of such an accident. Under the act, utilities are required to maintain private accident insurance of $ 300 million per reactor [...] the maximum the insurance industry will provide. In the event of a catastrophic accident, every nuclear utility would be required to contribute up to $ 95. 8 million for each licensed reactor to a pool to help cover the accident's cost. The collective cap on nuclear operator liability is $ 10. 2 billion. This compares with an estimate by Sandia National Laboratory that a worst-case accident could cost $ 700 billion, a sum equal to the recent U. S. financial bailout. So anything above $ 10. 2 billion would be covered by taxpayers. Another huge cost of nuclear power involves decommissioning the plants when they wear out. A 2004 International Atomic Energy Agency report estimates the decommissioning cost per reactor at $ 250 [...] 500 million, excluding the cost of removing and disposing of the spent nuclear fuel. But recent estimates for some reactors, such as the U. K. Magnox reactors that have high decommissioning waste volumes, decommissioning costs can reach $ 1. 8 billion per reactor. In addition to the costs just cited, the industry must cope with rising construction and fuel expenses. Two years ago, building a 1, 500 -megawatt nuclear plant was estimated to cost $ 2 - 4 billion. As of late 2008, that figure had climbed past $ 7 billion, reflecting primarily the scarcity of essential engineering and construction skills in a fading industry. Nuclear fuel costs have risen even more rapidly. At the beginning of this decade uranium cost roughly $ 10 per pound. Today it costs more than $ 60 per pound. The higher uranium price reflects the need to move to ever deeper mines, which increases the energy needed to extract the ore, and the shift to lower-grade ore. In the United States in the late 1950 s, for example, uranium ore contained roughly 0. 28 percent uranium oxide. By the 1990 s, it had dropped to 0. 09 percent. This means, of course, that the cost of mining larger quantities of ore, and that of getting it from deeper mines, ensures even higher future costs of nuclear fuel. Few nuclear power plants are being built in countries with competitive electricity markets. The reason is simple. Nuclear cannot compete with other electricity sources. This explains why nuclear plant construction is now concentrated in countries like Russia and China where nuclear development is state-controlled. The high cost of nuclear power also explains why so few plants are being built compared with a generation ago. In an illuminating article in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, nuclear consultant Mycle Schneider projects an imminent decline in world nuclear generating capacity. He notes there are currently 439 operating reactors worldwide. To date, 119 reactors have been closed, at an average age of 22 years. If we generously assume a much longer average lifespan of 40 years, then 93 reactors will close between 2008 and 2015. Another 192 will close between 2016 and 2025. And the remaining 154 will close after 2025. But only 36 nuclear reactors are currently under construction worldwide [...] 31 of them in Eastern Europe and Asia. Although there is much talk of building new nuclear plants in the United States, there are none under construction. What these numbers indicate, Schneider points out, is that plant closings will soon exceed plant openings [...] and by a widening margin in the years ahead. The trend is clear. From 2000 to 2005, an average of 4, 000 megawatts of nuclear generating capacity was added each year. Since 2005, this has dropped to only 1, 000 megawatts of additional capacity per year. Even if all reactors scheduled to come online by 2015 make it, the projected closing of 93 nuclear reactors by then will drop nuclear power generation roughly 10 percent below the current level. Unless governments start routinely granting operating permits for reactors more than 40 years old, a half-century of growth in world nuclear generating capacity is about to be replaced by a long-term decline. Despite all the industry hype about a nuclear future, private investors are openly skeptical. In fact, while little private capital is going into nuclear power, investors are pouring tens of billions of dollars into wind farms each year. And while the world's nuclear generating capacity is estimated to expand by only 1, 000 megawatts this year, wind generating capacity will likely grow by 30, 000 megawatts. In addition, solar cell installations and the construction of solar thermal and geothermal power plants are all growing by leaps and bounds. The reason for this extraordinary gap between the construction of nuclear power plants and wind farms is simple: wind is much more attractive economically. Wind yields more energy, more jobs, and more carbon reduction per dollar invested than nuclear. Though nuclear power plants are still being built in some countries and governments are talking them up in others, the reality is that we are entering the age of wind, solar, and geothermal energy...|$|R
