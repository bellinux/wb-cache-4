This problem may be overcome by implementing direct fuel injection into the combustion chamber.

2500|$|Slow {{combustion}}. Fuel combustion is slow, {{because the}} combustion chamber is long, thin, and moving. Flame travel occurs {{almost exclusively in}} the direction of rotor movement, adding to the quenching that is the main source of unburned hydrocarbons at high rpm. The trailing side of the combustion chamber naturally produces a [...] "squeeze stream" [...] that prevents the flame from reaching the chamber trailing edge. Fuel injection, in which fuel is injected towards {{the leading edge of the}} combustion chamber, can minimize the amount of <b>unburnt</b> <b>fuel</b> in the exhaust. Where piston engines have an expanding combustion chamber for the burning fuel as its oxidized and decreasing pressure as the piston travels toward the bottom of the cylinder during the power stroke is offset by additional leverage of the piston on the crankshaft during the first half of that travel, there is no additional [...] "leverage" [...] of a rotor on the [...] "crankshaft" [...] during combustion and the [...] "crankshaft" [...] has no increased leverage to power the rotor through the intake, compression and exhaust phases of its cycle.|$|E

It may allow for more ideally placed firelines in lighter fuels using natural barriers to fire and for safer firefighter working conditions in less smoke filled and cooler areas.

30|$|The {{species was}} extirpated {{from two of}} the fifteen 10 m 2 sample plots {{as a result of}} {{repeated}} fires at short intervals burning these plots before the plants had reached maturity. These plots burnt at short intervals because of a localised accumulation of flammable jarrah leaf litter originating from a single large tree near the plots. This highlights the importance of fine-scale variation in fuel continuity, quantity, and, hence, flammability to the survivability of fire sensitive plants. This variability in fuel flammability and consequent fire behaviour is most evident when fires are burning under mild weather, higher fuel moisture content conditions, and in recently burnt fuels, and least evident or non-existent under extreme weather, low fuel moisture conditions, and long <b>unburnt</b> <b>fuels</b> when virtually all vegetation types are likely to burn.|$|R

The computed results show (1) the mass burning rate distributions at the solid surface are qualitatively different near the flame (pyrolysis base region), (2) the first-order pyrolysis model shows that the propagating flame leaves <b>unburnt</b> solid <b>fuel,</b> and (3) the flame length and spread rate dependence on sample thickness are different for the two cases...|$|R
5000|$|Backfiring in {{internal}} combustion engines occurs {{outside of the}} combustion chamber, and is typically {{the result of an}} improper air to fuel ratio. An overly lean air-fuel mixture (i.e. an overabundance of air) can lead to a failure to ignite in the combustion chamber, also called a [...] "misfire". The <b>unburnt</b> <b>fuel</b> then enters the exhaust system, where hot components can cause the fuel to ignite unpredictably. Alternatively, rich air-fuel mixtures (i.e. an overabundance of fuel) can result in incomplete combustion, again causing <b>unburnt</b> <b>fuel</b> to enter the exhaust system.|$|E

40|$|A {{method for}} {{performed}} experiments using stationary gas burners and liquid fuel-soaked wicks to study flame geometry and buoyant instabilities important to fundamental wildland fire behaviour has been developed. This thesis focuses on experiments performed with stationary fires to carefully study instabilities observed in spreading fires that suggest {{they play a}} critical role in fire spread. Two types of flow conditions were used to perform experiments similar to wildfire spread conditions: sloped fuel surface and forced-flow (wind aided). Small- scale inclined experiments for performed at the University of Maryland with liquid- fuel soaked wicks and large-scale experiments at the USDA Forest Service Missoula Fire Sciences Laboratory with a gas-burner. These experiments were performed with over a range of heat-release-rates and burner sizes for angles from 0 to 60 degrees from the horizontal. Forced-flow experiments were performed in a large-scale wind tunnel at the Missoula Fire Laboratory and at the University of Maryland with a well characterized wind blower with gas-burners. These experiments were performed for a range of heat-release-rates and burner sizes in wind speeds from 0. 2 to 3. 0 ms&# 8722; 1 The flame geometry was determined using high-speed videography. Important two-dimensional flame geometry parameters such as centerline flame length and flame tilt angle were measured from these images. Flame intermittency and pulsation close to the surface was measured using high-speed videography and micro-thermocouples. A method was developed to track the extension of the flame close to the surface which would come in direct contact with <b>unburnt</b> <b>fuels</b> ahead of the fire. These methods showed that the pul- sation frequency is complicated suggesting large scale structures in the flow. Using these frequency the stationary experiments follow similar Strouhal-Froude scaling for flame pulsations in spreading fires. Stream-wise streaks in the flow were observed and measured using high-speed videography. Streak spacing has been observed to be associated with possible Gotler votice structures in the fire. The spacing for streaks at the base of the flame for these startionary experiments appear to be dependent on the boundary- layer conditions and could possibly scale with the centerline flame length similar to flame towers observed in spreading fires...|$|R

About 99 % of the fly ash produced in a typical coal-fired power station is removed by electrostatic precipitators or baghouse filters located {{at the base of}} the emission stack. Precipitator efficiency is dependent on the charging properties of the fly ash particles and the adhesive forces between them. These forces depend on the size, morphology, chemical constitution and phase distribution of the fly ash.

This paper reports the estimation of doses that the Australian participants received {{as a result of their}} involvement. Both the external and internal exposure pathways were considered. Most participants received very small doses: 79 % of all participants received 20 mSv, the current internationally recommended annual dose limit to workers. The largest dose recorded was 133 mSv, received by aircrew conducting sampling in the nuclear cloud soon after detonation. Most doses > 20 mSv were received by groups who entered the near vicinity of the explosions or fallout contaminated areas to collect samples or instruments soon after a detonation. Internal doses were a very small component of the total dose during the first few months after detonation, but thereafter inhalation became an increasingly important pathway due to the presence of <b>unburnt</b> nuclear <b>fuel</b> in fallout.

50|$|Suzuki Recycle Injection System (SRIS) was {{an attempt}} by the {{manufacturer}} to reduce visible emissions from a two stroke motorcycle. It was a small check valve in the bottom of each crank chamber. Two stroke engines have a tendency to collect <b>unburnt</b> oil and <b>fuel</b> {{in the bottom of the}} crank chamber at idle. Upon acceleration, after a period of idling, the unburned oil and fuel gets sucked up the transfer ports and contributes to an overrich mixture for the first 5 to 10 seconds resulting in a smokescreen from the exhaust. The SRIS plumbing routed the unburned fuel and oil to the next cylinder in the firing order thus allowing it to mix more thoroughly with the incoming charge of that cylinder and lowering the production of visible smoke. Overall fuel and oil consumption was unchanged but visible smoke was greatly reduced on sudden acceleration from rest.|$|R
40|$|A semi-implicit preconditioned {{iterative}} method is {{proposed for the}} time-integration of the stiff chemistry in simulations of unsteady reacting flows, such as turbulent flames, using detailed chemical kinetic mechanisms. Emphasis {{is placed on the}} simultaneous treatment of convection, diffusion, and chemistry, without using operator splitting techniques. The preconditioner corresponds to an approximation of the diagonal of the chemical Jacobian. Upon convergence of the sub-iterations, the fully-implicit, second-order time-accurate, Crank–Nicolson formulation is recovered. Performance of the proposed method is tested theoretically and numerically on one-dimensional laminar and three-dimensional high Karlovitz turbulent premixed n-heptane/air flames. The species lifetimes contained in the diagonal preconditioner are found to capture all critical small chemical timescales, such that the largest stable time step size for the simulation of the turbulent flame with the proposed method is limited by the convective CFL, rather than chemistry. The theoretical and numerical stability limits are in good agreement and are independent of the number of sub-iterations. The results indicate that the overall procedure is second-order accurate in time, free of lagging errors, and the cost per iteration {{is similar to that of}} an explicit time integration. The theoretical analysis is extended to a wide range of flames (premixed and non-premixed), <b>unburnt</b> conditions, <b>fuels,</b> and chemical mechanisms. In all cases, the proposed method is found (theoretically) to be stable and to provide good convergence rate for the sub-iterations up to a time step size larger than 1 μs. This makes the proposed method ideal for the simulation of turbulent flames...|$|R
40|$|Recent trends to {{downsize}} diesel engines {{have increased the}} stress on lubricants. Oils naturally degrade during operation, undergoing continual reactions, changing chemically and physically, detracting in performance from initial specifications. This thesis investigates the role of fuel in the ageing of diesel engine oils, specifically Ultra Low Sulphur Diesel (ULSD) and Rapeseed Methyl Ester (RME – a common European biodiesel). Oil ageing is assessed distinctly with fuel dilution, the entrainment of exhaust gases; {{and the effects of}} soot loading. Results show fuel dilution has the greatest influence on oil performance. Effects are seen with an instant ‘dilution’ of properties, with the resultant blend performing as an amalgam of the fluids. This can be both positive and negative, depending on the property being measured, with the entrainment of biodiesel generally beneficial. The entrainment of exhaust gases in the oil leads to increased <b>unburnt</b> hydrocarbons and <b>fuel</b> content, with similar dilution effects. Soot loaded oil performance is heavily dependent on the respective fuel content. RME contamination has a positive influence which far outweighs its negligible soot production, whereas ULSD detracts from oil performance, also producing more soot. During an equivalent timeframe, the influence of RME is less detrimental than ULSD on overall performance...|$|R

2500|$|Exhaust steam is {{directed}} upwards {{out of the}} locomotive through the chimney, {{by way of a}} nozzle called a blastpipe, creating the familiar [...] "chuffing" [...] sound of the steam locomotive. The blastpipe is placed at a strategic point inside the smokebox that {{is at the same time}} traversed by the combustion gases drawn through the boiler and grate by the action of the steam blast. The combining of the two streams, steam and exhaust gases, is crucial to the efficiency of any steam locomotive, and the internal profiles of the chimney (or, strictly speaking, the ejector) require careful design and adjustment. This has been the object of intensive studies by a number of engineers (and often ignored by others, sometimes with catastrophic consequences). The fact that the draught depends on the exhaust pressure means that power delivery and power generation are automatically self-adjusting. Among other things, a balance has to be struck between obtaining sufficient draught for combustion whilst giving the exhaust gases and particles sufficient time to be consumed. In the past, a strong draught could lift the fire off the grate, or cause the ejection of <b>unburnt</b> particles of <b>fuel,</b> dirt and pollution for which steam locomotives had an unenviable reputation. Moreover, the pumping action of the exhaust has the counter-effect of exerting back pressure on the side of the piston receiving steam, thus slightly reducing cylinder power. Designing the exhaust ejector became a specific science, with engineers such as Chapelon, Giesl and Porta making large improvements in thermal efficiency and a significant reduction in maintenance time and pollution. A similar system was used by some early gasoline/kerosene tractor manufacturers (Advance-Rumely/Hart-Parr) – the exhaust gas volume was vented through a cooling tower, allowing the steam exhaust to draw more air past the radiator.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} use of remote sensing technologies for measuring and mapping {{the changes in the}} forest understorey in response to prescribed burning. Remote sensing has been used extensively to map the burn areas in fire-affected landscapes, but less work has been done focussing on beneath the canopy. Sub-canopy vegetation layers are important for habitat and for understanding the fuel hazards they may pose to the risk of wildfire. Accordingly, instruments and approaches must be able to perform in both pre- and post-burn environments, and be able to provide meaningful measures of change. Wildfires are increasing in intensity and frequency, and in response prescribed burning is used to mitigate threats posed by them. Quantifying post-fire effects is important for burn severity, ecosystem recovery and post-fire hazard assessments. This information will allow land managers and scientists to understand fires in their environmental, economic and social contexts and help formulate responses and policies accordingly. However, measures of fire effects and fuel hazards which are done via visual assessments are known to be subjective and inconsistent between assessors and over time. What is needed is an improvement in the reporting procedures around quantification of fire effects which are both repeatable and quantifiable. In this research two remote sensing technologies were used to measure, map and track changes in the understorey of an Australian dry sclerophyll forest. Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) was used to derive vegetation structure variables and HSR (HyperSpectral Radiometry) was used to derive vegetation physiological variables. The study site was located in St. Andrews, Victoria, Australia within which a control plot and three fire treatment plots were set-up and monitored over a two year period, before and after a prescribed fire event conducted in autumn 2012. The datasets collected were used for statistical and spatial analysis of changes in understorey vegetation, and to assess those metrics best suited for describing different vegetation responses to fire effects. The first part of this research examined the potential of TLS to detect fire-induced change in the forest understorey. From TLS point clouds a total of 18 metrics were extracted which were tested against accuracy and reliability criteria. Three metrics; mean AGHchange (Above Ground Height), median AGHchange and point countchange were shortlisted. To report different post-fire changes in burnt understorey, mean AGHchange metric was used. This metric was able to report fire effects such as total burn area, measures of patchiness, spatial distribution of burnt and <b>unburnt</b> areas, <b>fuel</b> accumulation and prescribed burn efficiency across various temporal scales. The second part of this research analysed hyperspectral data of the near-surface (grass) and surface fuel layer (litter). Spectral changes in the near-surface fuel layer were observed in Visible (550 nm), Near-Infrared (680 - 750 nm) and Middle Infrared (970 nm, 1220 nm, 1550 nm) domains of the electromagnetic spectrum. For the surface fuel layer (litter) changes were observed in the Middle Infrared domain (1140 nm, 1225 nm and 1700 nm). The greatest difference from pre-burn levels for both the fuel layers occurred within the first two weeks post-burn. Spectral indices corresponding to the above determined broad spectral bands were tested to ascertain which were best at characterising burnt from unburnt targets whilst also tracking recovery. Indices such as NDVI, NBR and D 720 were found to be the most suitable for near-surface fuel layer whilst D 1230 for surface fuel layer. A preliminary investigation into comparing the change detected by the two remote sensing technologies suggested that physiological change detected by HSR, recorded vegetation recovery as early as six weeks post-burn. Structural change detected by TLS even after two years post-burn was recorded as being close to two weeks post-burn levels. This finding matched well with visual assessments of structural measures (plant cover and height). The findings {{of this study suggest that}} improvements in reporting procedures around quantification of fire effects can be achieved using TLS and HSR technology. TLS-derived structural metric, mean AGHchange can accurately detect quantified measures of fire-induced change in forest understorey that can be validated with field assessments. It can also report post-fire effects at various temporal scales including area burnt, burn patchiness, fuel load accumulation and prescribed burn efficiency. Spectral indices such as NDVI, NBR and D 720 were able to accurately detect both vegetation loss and recovery. There is merit in further investigating TLS and HSR in conjunction for quantified and robust reporting of fire effects. The change detected by these technologies can be linked to inform both vegetation recovery and fuel accumulation...|$|R
50|$|An engine {{requires}} {{large amounts}} of air when operating at high speeds. However, the intake valves may close before enough air has entered each combustion chamber, reducing performance. On the other hand, if the camshaft keeps the valves open {{for longer periods of}} time, as with a racing cam, problems start to occur at the lower engine speeds. Opening the exhaust valve while the intake valve is still open may cause <b>unburnt</b> <b>fuel</b> to exit the engine, leading to lower engine performance and increased emissions.|$|E
50|$|Automotive oxygen sensors, colloquially {{known as}} O2 ("ō two") sensors, make modern {{electronic}} fuel injection and emission control possible. They help determine, in real time, if the air-fuel ratio of a combustion engine is rich or lean. Since oxygen sensors {{are located in the}} exhaust stream, they do not directly measure the air or the fuel entering the engine but when information from oxygen sensors is coupled with information from other sources, {{it can be used to}} indirectly determine the air-fuel ratio. Closed loop feedback-controlled fuel injection varies the fuel injector output according to real-time sensor data rather than operating with a predetermined (open-loop) fuel map. In addition to enabling {{electronic fuel injection}} to work efficiently, this emissions control technique can reduce the amounts of both <b>unburnt</b> <b>fuel</b> and oxides of nitrogen entering the atmosphere. <b>Unburnt</b> <b>fuel</b> is pollution in the form of air-borne hydrocarbons, while oxides of nitrogen (NOx gases) are a result of combustion chamber temperatures exceeding 1,300 kelvin due to excess air in the fuel mixture and contribute to smog and acid rain. Volvo was the first automobile manufacturer to employ this technology in the late 1970s, along with the three-way catalyst used in the catalytic converter.|$|E
50|$|Emissions output was {{controlled}} by several systems. The EGR, or Exhaust Gas Recirculation system, brought exhaust gas from the exhaust stream up to the intake manifold, lowering peak combustion temperatures, the goal being the reduction of NOX emissions. A PCV, or Positive Crankcase Ventilation system, introduced oil vapor and <b>unburnt</b> <b>fuel</b> vapors from the crankcase to the intake, allowing the engine to re-use these as well. Furthermore, gasoline vapors that would normally be released into the atmosphere were captured by the EVAP system, to then be introduced into the engine.|$|E
50|$|This poor {{combustion}} {{leads to}} soot formation and <b>unburnt</b> <b>fuel</b> residues which clogs and gums piston rings, causing a further drop in sealing efficiency and exacerbates the initial low pressure.

If oxygen is then re-introduced to the compartment, e.g. by opening a door or window to a closed room, combustion will restart, often rapidly, as the gases are heated by the combustion and expand rapidly because of the rapidly increasing temperature.|$|E
