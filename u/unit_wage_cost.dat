40|$|In an {{international}} hierarchy of labour costs, Austria ranks 11 th, after Germany, Switzerland, the Scandinavian countries, Japan, the U. S. and the Netherlands. The labour factor is most expensive in Germany. At ATS 340 per hour of labour, German manufacturers {{pay more than}} a quarter over the Austrian rate. For Austrian manufacturers, a worker's hour costs ATS 270. 40 in 2000, or 2. 75 percent more than the EU average. Non-wage labour costs in manufacturing were 90. 2 percent in 2000, a drop of 0. 8 percentage points against 1999, due to lower severance payments. For the Austrian economy, its international position with regard to its unit labour cost fluctuated throughout the 1990 s. In {{the first half of the}} last decade, industries in Austria found their situation deteriorating substantially, fuelled by rocketing wage inflation and an appreciation of the schilling in the wake of the EMS crisis, whereas in the second half relative unit labour cost came down by 2. 7 percent p. a. compared to the average of Austria's trading partners and calculated in a single currency, the consequence of lower wage inflation, continuously high productivity growth (+ 5. 3 percent p. a.) and a better currency standing. Altogether, the relative <b>unit</b> <b>wage</b> <b>cost</b> position for Austrian manufacturers improved by well over 10 percent in the 1990 s. In 2000, unit wage costs declined by 6. 0 percent, considering that the hourly wage rate went up by 1. 9 percent and hourly productivity grew by 8. 4 percent. Supported by the strong recovery of the yen and dollar, Austria's international unit labour cost ranking improved by 6. 5 percent over the average of its trading partners and by well over 4. 5 percent over the EU average.

40|$|This article showcases ongoing {{work within}} ONS {{to develop a}} new unit labour costs {{indicator}} for the UK by building upon the existing <b>unit</b> <b>wage</b> <b>costs</b> series. It begins by examining the concept of <b>unit</b> <b>wage</b> <b>costs,</b> describing what the series aims to measure and explaining some of the conceptual difficulties when estimating data in practice. The first issue concerns the series used to measure the labour <b>costs</b> of employees; <b>wages</b> and salaries are currently used instead of the more comprehensive compensation of employees (CoE) series. Secondly, the labour costs of the self-employed are not satisfactorily estimated by the current method. Two possible methods {{for the development of a}} unit labour costs measure are outlined; both incorporate CoE as their employee labour costs measure, but take different approaches to estimating the labour costs of the self-employed. The article concludes that the preferred model for estimating unit labour costs proxies self-employed labour costs by applying the ratio of CoE to the sum of CoE and gross operating surplus in the employed sector to mixed income, a measure of total earnings in the selfemployed sector.

40|$|Austria {{currently}} takes 11 th {{place in}} an international ranking of unit labour costs. Labour is most expensive in Norway, Germany and Switzerland, where one hour of manufacturing labour costs almost a quarter more than in Austria. In Austrian manufacturing, one hour of work cost € 20. 31 in 2001, which was about 4 {{percent higher than the}} EU average. The amount was composed of <b>wages</b> <b>costing</b> € 10. 65 and non-wage labour costs of € 9. 66. With this, non-wage labour costs made up 90. 7 percent. In spite of a cut in the contribution by employers to the health insurance scheme for blue-colour workers, it was 0. 8 percentage points higher than in 2000, since severance payments, after declining substantially in 2000, were once again on the rise. Non-wage labour costs in Austria are high because {{a large portion of the}} annual income is in the form of tax-privileged bonus payments (13 th and 14 th monthly salaries). If these bonus payments were counted as fixed parts of the wage or salary, non-wage labour costs would make up 63. 2 percent for manufacturing. Austria's ranking in terms of unit labour costs changed several times over the course of the 1990 s. In the first half of the decade, Austrian industries lost ground due to considerable wage inflation and the schilling's upward revaluation due to the crisis in the European monetary system. After the mid- 1990 s, a better currency situation and lower wage inflation, with sustained high rates of productivity growth, markedly improved price competition: relative unit labour costs have since been declining on a uniform currency base against the average of trade partners, by well over 2. 5 percent p. a. Altogether, Austrian manufacturing has been able to improve its <b>unit</b> <b>wage</b> <b>costs</b> position by a good 10 percent since the early 1990 s. In 2001, the cost of an hour of work rose by 3. 5 percent; with productivity growth declining to + 1. 3 percent (as against + 7. 3 percent in 2000), <b>unit</b> <b>wage</b> <b>costs</b> in Austrian manufacturing went up by 2. 1 percent. With <b>unit</b> <b>wage</b> <b>costs</b> rising similarly in competing countries, Austria's relative ranking remained unchanged over the previous year.

Correspondingly, both characteristics are reflected (at least implicitly) in the mathematical form of these models: firstly, the models are in discrete time; secondly, they are deterministic.

The conditional portion of this phrase refers to the fact that this function is conditional on a given level of output, so output is one argument of the function.

A two-step method, inspired from Deaton [1987, 1988, 1990] and Crawford et al. [1996] is then proposed, that allows us to account for heterogeneity while making a minimum set of hypotheses. Illustration is then given using data from Taiwan. The results validate the proposed method of estimation and shed light on the functioning of the labour market, in a period during which large flows of young qualified workers entered the labour market and women increased their participation. ...|$|R
