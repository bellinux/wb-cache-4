40|$|By an undirected rigid {{formation}} of mobile autonomous agents is meant a formation based on graph rigidity {{in which each}} pair of "neighboring" agents is responsible for maintaining a prescribed target distance between them. In a recent paper a systematic method was proposed for devising gradient control laws for asymptotically stabilizing a large class of rigid, undirected formations in two dimensional space assuming all agents are described by kinematic point models. The aim {{of this paper is}} to explain what happens to such formations if neighboring agents have slightly different <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> desired distance between them is supposed to be or equivalently if neighboring agents have differing estimates <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> actual distance between them is. In either case, what one would expect would be a gradual distortion of the formation from its target shape as discrepancies in desired or sensed distances increase. While this is observed for the gradient laws in question, something else quite unexpected happens at the same time. It is shown that for any rigidity-based, undirected {{formation of}} this type which is comprised of three or more agents, that if some neighboring agents have slightly different <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> desired distances between them are suppose to be, then almost for certain, the trajectory of the resulting distorted but rigid formation will converge exponentially fast to a closed circular orbit in two-dimensional space which is traversed periodically at a constant angular speed.

2500|$|Wyler, like Zimbalist, {{was also}} {{unhappy with the}} script. He felt Tunberg's draft {{was too much of}} a {{morality}} play overlaid with current Western political overtones, and that the dialogue was too modern-sounding. Zimbalist brought in playwright S. N. Behrman (who also wrote the script for Quo Vadis) and then playwright Maxwell Anderson to write drafts. Behrman spent about a month working on the script, but how much he contributed to the final version is unclear. Both a contemporary account in the British magazine Films and Filmmaking as well as Vidal biographer Fred Kaplan claim that Anderson was ill and unable to work on the script. The New York Times however, reported in June 1957 that Anderson was at work on the script. Vidal said that, by spring 1958, the script largely reflected Anderson and Behrman's work and nearly all the dialogue was in Anderson's [...] "elevated poetic style."

[...] His book An Introduction to the New Testament (1937) is a [...] "skeleton of the course." [...] However, [...] "it does not give the flesh put on that skeleton by the lecturer" [...] (p. ix). [...] It was of course that [...] "flesh" [...] which made the course so interesting, due to Lake's lively imagination and engaging wit. [...] As he himself explains: [...] "The most important thing in a teacher's life is not to impart the knowledge of facts—which can be found much better in books—but to encourage another generation to look steadfastly at the vision which it sees, and to face its own problems in the light of that vision, controlled and guided by an <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> past has done or not done" [...] (Paul, His Heritage and Legacy, 1934, p. xii).

[...] "Something we all recognized in Kirsopp Lake," [...] writes Adams, [...] "was that he had the imagination of a Sherlock Holmes. [...] He took an almost childlike interest in digging out alternative answers to historical questions ... Students who thought themselves completely secularized and immune to any 'religious nonsense' attended his lectures and heard him publicly burrow down into the biblical concepts, taking as his point of departure something highly imaginative in one of the parables, and then rise up to fly with it.

6000|$|Relationships are all due to {{the joint}} action of two groups of {{variable}} causes, the one common to both of the related objects, the other special to each, {{as in the case}} just discussed. Using an analogous nomenclature to that already employed, the peculiarity of one of the two objects is due to an aggregate of variable causes that we may call C+X, and that of the other to C+Z, in which C are the causes common to both, and X and Z the special ones. In exact proportion as X and Z diminish, and C becomes of overpowering effect, so does the closeness of the relationship increase. When X and Z both disappear, the result is identity of character. On the other hand, when C disappears, all relationship ceases, and the variations of the two objects are strictly independent. The simplest case is that in which X and Z are equal, and in this, it becomes easy to devise a scale in which 0° shall stand for no relationship, and 100° for identity, and upon which the intermediate degrees of relationship may be marked at their proper value. Upon this assumption, but with some misgiving, I will attempt to subject the digits to this form of measurement.

6000|$|But {{how does}} the flame get hold of the fuel? There is a {{beautiful}} point about that--capillary attraction[4]. [...] "Capillary attraction!" [...] you say,--"the attraction of hairs." [...] Well, never mind the name: it was given in old times, before {{we had a good}} <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> real power was. It is by what is called capillary attraction that the fuel is conveyed to the part where combustion goes on, and is deposited there, not in a careless way, but very beautifully in the very midst of the centre of action which takes place around it. Now, I am going to give you one or two instances of capillary attraction. It is that kind of action or attraction which makes two things that do not dissolve in each other still hold together. When you wash your hands, you wet them thoroughly; you take a little soap to make the adhesion better, and you find your hand remains wet. This is by that kind of attraction of which I am about to speak. And, what is more, if your hands are not soiled (as they almost always are by the usages of life), if you put your finger into a little warm water, the water will creep a little way up the finger, though you may not stop to examine it. I have here a substance which is rather porous--a column of salt--and I will pour into the plate at the bottom, not water, as it appears, but a saturated solution of salt which cannot absorb more; so that the action which you see will not be due to its dissolving anything. We may consider the plate to be the candle, and the salt the wick, and this solution the melted tallow. (I have coloured the fluid, that you may see the action better.) You observe that, now I pour in the fluid, it rises and gradually creeps up the salt higher and higher; and provided the column does not tumble over, it will go to the top.|$|E
6000|$|I {{said just}} now, that happy was the sportsman {{who was also}} a naturalist. And, having once {{mentioned}} these curious water-flies, I cannot help going a little farther, and saying, that lucky is the fisherman who is also a naturalist. A fair scientific knowledge of the flies which he imitates, and of their habits, would often ensure him sport, while other men are going home with empty creels. [...] One would have fancied this a self-evident fact; yet I have never found any sound knowledge of the natural water-flies which haunt a given stream, except among cunning old fishermen of the lower class, who get their living by the gentle art, and bring to indoors baskets of trout killed on flies, which look {{as if they had been}} tied with a pair of tongs, so rough and ungainly are they; but which, nevertheless, kill, simply because they are (in COLOUR, which is all that fish really care for) exact likenesses of some obscure local species, which happen to be on the water at the time. [...] Among gentlemen-fishermen, on the other hand, so deep is the ignorance of the natural fly, that I have known good sportsmen still under the delusion that the great green May-fly comes out of a caddis-bait; the gentlemen having never seen, much less fished with, that most deadly bait the [...] "Water-cricket," [...] or free creeping larva of the May-fly, which may be found in May under the river- banks. The consequence of this ignorance is that they depend for good patterns of flies on mere chance and experiment; and that the shop patterns, originally excellent, deteriorate continually, till little or no likeness to their living prototype remains, being tied by town girls, who have no more <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> feathers and mohair in their hands represent than they have of what the National Debt represents. Hence follows many a failure at the stream-side; because the [...] "Caperer," [...] or [...] "Dun," [...] or [...] "Yellow Sally," [...] which is produced from the fly-book, though, possibly, like the brood which came out three years since on some stream a hundred miles away, is quite unlike the brood which is out to-day on one's own river. For not only do most of these flies vary in colour in different soils and climates, but many of them change their hue during life; the Ephemerae, especially, have a habit of throwing off the whole of their skins (even, marvellously enough, to the skin of the eyes and wings, and the delicate [...] "whisks" [...] at their tail), and appearing in an utterly new garb after ten minutes' rest, to the discomfiture of the astonished angler.|$|E
