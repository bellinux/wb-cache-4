5|$|The {{influence}} of the fatwa was limited to Spain.

5|$|He {{was said}} to have been crowned by St Humbert (Bishop Humbert of Elmham) on 25 December 855, at a {{location}} known as Burna (probably Bures St. Mary in Suffolk) which at that time functioned as the royal capital. Later versions of his life recorded that he was a model king who treated all his subjects with equal justice and who was <b>unbending</b> to flatterers. It was written that he withdrew for a year to his royal tower at Hunstanton and learned the whole Psalter, so that he could recite it from memory.|$|E
5|$|The Mufti re-established the Arab Higher Committee (AHC) in late 1946 and Darwaza {{joined the}} ten-member council upon {{a request from}} the Mufti. Darwaza, along with Emil Ghuri and Mu'in al-Madi, served as the AHC's delegates to the September 1947 {{convention}} of the Arab League's Political Committee in Lebanon. With support from the Transjordanian representative, Salih Jaber, the Prime Minister of Iraq, openly criticized the delegates and questioned the AHC's right to even send delegates to the convention. Later that year, Darwaza resigned from the AHC due to the Mufti's <b>unbending</b> attitude towards wider representation.|$|E

5|$|In 1655 Wheelwright {{moved back}} to England with his family, and preached {{near his home in}} Lincolnshire. While in England he was entertained by two of his very {{powerful}} friends, Oliver Cromwell, who became England's Lord Protector, and Sir Henry Vane, who occupied several key positions in the government. The political tide turned markedly during the more than six years he was there, and following Cromwell's death and Vane's execution, Wheelwright returned to New England to become the minister in Salisbury, Massachusetts, where he spent the remainder of his life. He was characterized as being contentious and <b>unbending,</b> but also forgiving, energetic and courageous. His sincere piety was never called into question, even by those whose opinions differed greatly from his.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} summer came the Bodyline series, when England toured under Douglas Jardine and targeted the upper bodies of the Australian batsmen with short-pitched bowling, using a close leg side cordon to catch balls fended away from the body. In one of the tour matches before the Tests, Fingleton scored a defiant 119*, carrying his bat for New South Wales against the bumper barrage of Harold Larwood and Gubby Allen, ensuring his selection for the First Test. Despite his <b>unbending</b> resistance, his state fell to an innings defeat. In a warm-up for the Tests, he scored 29 and 53 not out for an Australian XI against the tourists, while most of his teammates struggled. His earlier experience held him in good stead as he scored 26 and 40 as Australia were crushed by ten wickets in the First Test in Sydney. Fingleton stood his ground and was hit several times. He then made a defiant four-hour innings to top-score with 83 in the first innings of Australia's only win of the series in the Second Test in Melbourne, although he did run out his batting partner Leo O'Brien in the process. This helped the Australians to reach 228 and they took a 59-run first innings lead before winning the match despite Fingleton making {{only one in the}} second innings. He appeared as well equipped as any Australian to combat England's strategy.|$|E

25|$|Assessments of de Valera's career have varied; he {{has often}} been characterised as a stern, <b>unbending,</b> devious, and {{divisive}} Irish politician. Biographer Tim Pat Coogan sees his time in power as being characterised by economic and cultural stagnation, while Diarmaid Ferriter argues that the stereotype of de Valera as an austere, cold and even backward figure was largely manufactured in the 1960s and is misguided.|$|E
25|$|Dunner also {{subsequently}} {{served as}} European President of Agudath Israel, the main organisation representing the political interests of azionistic Orthodox Jews. He was an <b>unbending</b> {{supporter of the}} right of Jews to practise shechita in the UK, in the face of numerous attempts by animal rights groups to ban it. Typically, he argued that if kosher meat had to be imported, the costs would become so prohibitive that the largely poor Orthodox communities of Stamford Hill and beyond would effectively be forced to become vegetarians.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Skidmore (August 13, 1790 - August 7, 1832) was an American {{politician}} and radical political philosopher. Skidmore is best {{remembered as the}} co-founder {{and leader of the}} Working Men's Party in New York when it first emerged in the fall of 1829. He was forced out of the organization shortly after its initial electoral campaign by moderate leaders of the party on the grounds of Skidmore's excessive radicalism and <b>unbending</b> personality. Skidmore went on to establish an even less successful political organization in 1830, known as the Agrarian Party.|$|E

25|$|This {{pattern in}} turn {{suggests}} the following method of creating models of iterations of the Heighway dragon curve by folding {{a strip of}} paper. Take a strip of paper and fold it in half to the right. Fold it in half again to the right. If the strip was opened out now, <b>unbending</b> each fold to become a 90 degree turn, the turn sequence would be RRL i.e. the second iteration of the Heighway dragon. Fold the strip in half again to the right, and the turn sequence of the unfolded strip is now RRLRRLL – the third iteration of the Heighway dragon. Continuing folding the strip in half {{to the right to}} create further iterations of the Heighway dragon (in practice, the strip becomes too thick to fold sharply after four or five iterations).|$|E
25|$|Effi Briest was Fassbinder's dream {{film and}} {{the one in which}} he {{invested}} the most work. While he normally took between nine and 20 days to make a film, this time it required 58 shooting days, dragged out over two years. The film is a period piece adapted from Theodor Fontane's classic novel of 1894, concerning the consequences of betrayed love. Set in the closed, repressive Prussian society of the Bismarck era, the film paints a portrait of a woman's fate completely linked to an <b>unbending</b> and utterly unforgiving code of social behavior. The plot follows the story of Effi Briest, a young woman who seeks to escape her stifling marriage to a much older man by entering into a brief affair with a charming soldier. Six years later, Effi's husband discovers her affair with tragic consequences.|$|E
25|$|This was {{the second}} time trial stage, with long {{straight}} stretches, some beautiful sections of <b>unbending</b> road and some slight inclines (with one located about 600 m to the finish line). It was clear that time-trial specialists would be the center of attention. After an impressive performance during the Pyrenees crossing and the capture of the yellow jersey due to Michael Rasmussen's dismissal, Alberto Contador expressed his concerns about being beaten in the final time trial of the competition. Before the riders located above the 20th place started, Belgian Leif Hoste set a time of 1h 05' 32", making him the 1st ranked rider of the stage {{for a long period of}} time. Nonetheless, with the start of the favourites for the stage, he gradually went down through the standings, finishing in 9th position. David Millar, who was expected to be a contender for victory, experienced mechanical trouble, needing to change bikes twice within the first kilometer.|$|E

25|$|The {{death of}} their aunt in October {{of the same year}} forced them to return once more to Haworth. Aunt Branwell had left all her worldly goods in equal shares to her nieces and to Eliza Kingston, a cousin in Penzance, which had the {{immediate}} effect of purging all their debts and providing a small reserve of funds. Nevertheless, they were asked to return to Brussels as they were regarded as being competent and were needed. They were each offered teaching posts in the boarding school, still English for Charlotte and music for Emily. However, Charlotte returned alone to Belgium in January 1843, while Emily remained critical of Monsieur Heger, in spite of the excellent opinion he held of her. He later stated that she 'had the spirit of a man', and would probably become a great traveller due to her being gifted with a superior faculty of reason that allowed her to deduce ancient knowledge of new spheres of knowledge, and her <b>unbending</b> willpower would have triumphed over all obstacles.|$|E
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1887, a {{memorial}} window to Jones and his wife was installed in a new Episcopal church erected near their former Bogota residence. Jones was further memorialized in historian Joseph Addison Waddell's Annals of Augusta County, Virginia (1886), in which Waddell remarked of Jones: [...] "He was considered {{a man of great}} ability and <b>unbending</b> integrity. His only fault, or the only one which tradition tells of, was an extremely irritable temper, which, when aroused, expressed itself in the strongest terms he could command, mingled with no little profanity. Having a scorn of all dishonesty and meanness, he did not spare a miscreant by tongue or pen." [...] In his Historic Families of Kentucky (1889), historian and genealogist Thomas Marshall Green said of Jones: [...] "Gabriel Jones rose rapidly in his profession; in attainments he was second to no man at the colonial bar; in native ability he was conspicuous among those who stood in the first rank." ...|$|E

[...] Peter Paterson of the Daily Mail described Meyer as [...] "an arrogant, sarcastic, demanding tyrant", a surgeon who [...] "insults his subordinates, terrifies the nurses, and unashamedly puts his social life {{at least on}} a level with his hospital duties." [...] Paterson called Meyer [...] "saturnine and sinister in appearance", likening him to James Robertson Justice's Doctor in the House consultant Lancelot Spratt. Shane Donaghey of The People compared Meyer to Hannibal Lecter, describing him as [...] "Part panto villain, part grim reaper, with a bedside manner of a cruel vet" [...] and commenting that he manages his department [...] "with an iron fist veiled in a concrete glove." [...] The Daily Mail Christopher Matthew called Meyer [...] "wonderfully supercilious", and [...] "one of the great television monsters of our age", likening Irving's portrayal {{to that of a}} foreign spy in a 1950s British war film.|$|E
