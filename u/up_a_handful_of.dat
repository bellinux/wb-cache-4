5|$|At the {{election}} party, Lana arrives with Chloe, but she once again leaves again when Lex calls. This time Lex kisses {{her when he}} learns of her break up, which causes Lana to leave. Like before, Lex pursues Lana, but this time Clark arrives in time to stop the bus. Jonathan goes to the farm after receiving a mysterious call during the party, and is greeted by Lionel Luthor (John Glover). Lionel insinuates he knows Clark's secret and shows a picture to Jonathan, which causes Jonathan to begin punching Lionel in anger. Jonathan dismisses Lionel and laboriously walks away, breathing heavily. Martha and Clark drive up and catch him as he has a heart attack, and, after taking a final look at his family, Jonathan dies {{in the arms of}} Martha and Clark. At Jonathan's funeral, all of Clark's close friends attend, as well as the Luthors. When the funeral is over, Clark picks <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> dirt and sprinkles it into his father's grave.|$|E
5|$|For {{five years}} after the {{expansion}} era contract with ESPN ended in 1997, the CFL was absent on American television. At the end of 2001 the league began a relationship with America One that would last until 2009. Coverage was relatively generous with 43 games, including the playoffs, covered in the last year. A more modest deal of 14 games was negotiated with the NFL Network in 2010, which lasted two years. The 2012 season began without a contract and the league resorted to internet broadcasts on ESPN3 until NBC Sports Network agreed to a 14-game regular season package of its own; unlike the NFL network, NBC opted to broadcast games during the NFL preseason as well as cover the playoffs and Grey Cup. Both the NBC and ESPN deals were renewed in 2013 with a slight scaling back of playoff coverage and ESPN2 also picking <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> games in the summer months. American broadcasts have been simulcasts of game coverage from Canadian networks.|$|E
5|$|The Browns next {{played the}} Rockets {{for a second}} time in as many weeks, this time in Cleveland. The Rockets opened the scoring with a 74-yard pass from quarterback Jesse Freitas to {{receiver}} Eddie Prokop in the first four minutes of the game, and added a field goal by Jim McCarthy {{near the end of the}} second quarter. The Browns did not score in the first half, but came back to win the game in the second. Rockets defenders were double-teaming Cleveland's ends, and the Browns adjusted by sending halfbacks out to receive deep passes. Cleveland halfbacks Dub Jones and Bill Boedeker both caught long touchdown passes from Graham in the third quarter. Boedeker ran in for another touchdown in the fourth quarter to make the final score 21–10. As in the previous game, there were several cases of rough play: tackle Lou Rymkus was ejected from the game for hitting Jim Pearcy of the Rockets. A Rockets player picked <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> sand from the stadium's baseball infield and threw it in Mac Speedie's face during the game, temporarily blinding him. Hirsch was accidentally kicked by a Browns player and suffered a skull fracture.|$|E

25|$|Sportwereld was {{so young}} and so small for the big Ronde that we wanted. We had bitten off more than we could chew. It was hard, seeing a band of second-class riders riding across Flanders, {{scraping}} <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> centimes to help cover the costs. The same happened in 1914. No van Hauwaert, no Masselis, no Defraeye, no Mosson, no Mottiat, no Van Den Berghe, all forbidden to take part by their French bike companies.|$|E
25|$|On 12 March 1930, Mahatma Gandhi {{embarked}} on a sathyagraha with 79 followers from Sabarmathi Ashram to Dandi on the Arabian Sea coast. This march, known as the Dandi March, was sensationalized by the international press; film clippings and pictures of Mahatma Gandhi were relayed to distant corners of the world. Gandhi reached Dandi on 6 April 1930. After his morning bhajan, he waded in to the sea shore and picked <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> salt, proclaiming that with the handful of salt he was proclaiming {{the end of the}} British Empire. The police arrived and arrested thousands of national leaders including Gandhi. Gandhi's bold defiance of the salt law encouraged other Indians to break the law as well.|$|E
2500|$|Cricket in the 1860s {{underwent}} {{an evolutionary}} phase with the legalisation of overarm bowling in June 1864 and Grace himself {{said it was}} [...] "no exaggeration to say that, between 1860 and 1870, English cricket passed through its most critical period" [...] with the game in transition and [...] "it was quite a revolutionary period so far as its rules were concerned". Grace had {{much to say about}} the state of the grounds in the 1860s and declared that Lord's [...] "was in a very unsatisfactory condition". He added that wickets at The Oval were always much better than at Lord's, where the clay in the soil handicapped the groundsmen. Writing in 1899, Grace recollected that he [...] "could go on to the pitch at Lord's and pick <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> small pieces of gravel"; a source of danger as a fast ball hitting one of those small stones would [...] "fly high in the air".|$|E

2500|$|With little serious {{record company}} interest, the band took the {{initiative}} and made <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> demos of their latest recording [...] "Firebird Special", sending them out to their favourite record labels. US company Sympathy for the Record Industry were one such label and they immediately issued [...] "Firebird Special" [...] as a 7" [...] single in the USA and followed {{it up with a}} full-length CD album [...] "Unsafe.. At Any Speed". The album brought together their last couple of singles with a batch of new recordings and was a hit on the US underground/college circuit. As a result of this modest success, the band played a handful of US gigs but with no UK distribution and an indifferent UK music press, [...] "Unsafe" [...] failed to make a dent in the domestic market. A further single [...] "Ya Just A Little Punk" [...] followed, this time on indie 555 label, but the lack of success and nominal interest from the UK press may have prompted Jack to accept an offer to join The Wedding Present, first on bass and later on guitar.|$|E
