5000|$|The {{pork belly}} futures {{contract}} became {{an icon of}} futures and commodities trading. It is frequently used as a pars pro toto for commodities in general and appears in several depictions of the arena in popular entertainment (such as the 1974 movie For Pete's Sake, the 1983 movie Trading Places, and the 1991 cartoon [...] "Ren and Stimpy"). Inaugurated on August 18, 1961 on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), frozen pork belly futures were developed as a risk management device {{to meet the needs}} of meat packers who processed pork and had to contend with volatile hog prices, as well as price risks on processed products held in inventory. The futures contracts were useful in guiding inventories and establishing forward pricing. The <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>trading</b> was 20 short tons (40000 lb) of frozen, trimmed bellies. (Bellies typically weigh around 6 kg.) Pork bellies can be kept in cold storage for an extended period of time, and generally it was the frozen bellies that were most actively traded. Spot prices varied depending on the amount of inventory in cold storage and the seasonal demand for bacon as well as the origin of the pork; in the past, the former drove the prices of the futures as well.|$|E

40|$|The success <b>of</b> several {{environmental}} <b>trading</b> markets (ETMs) {{has led to}} {{proposals for}} broader use of ETMs in environmental and resource management policy. The successful ETMs all share a basic feature-they exchange <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> that are fungible, such as tons of sulfur dioxide or kilos of fish. This feature <b>of</b> <b>trading</b> promotes resource allocation efficiency while advancing environmental protection. But most commodities exchanged in current and proposed ETMs, such as wetlands and endangered species habitat, exhibit nonfungibilities across the dimensions of type, time, and space. Using ETMs to trade these commodities is no longer trading "environmental apples for apples," and thus the rationale for using ETMs is called into question. In this article, the authors develop a comprehensive analytical framework for evaluating ETMs {{from the perspective of}} commodity nonfungibility and explore the challenge presented by trading environmental apples for oranges. They argue that by focusing on nonfungible commodities and their currencies we can better explain the design of ETMs, their rules of exchange, and provisions for public participation...|$|R

40|$|Backus, Kehoe, and Kydland (International Real Business Cycles, JPE, 100 (4), 1992) {{documented}} several {{discrepancies between}} the observed post-war business cycles of developed {{countries and the}} predictions of a two-country, complete-market model. The main discrepancy termed as the â€œquantity anomalyâ€ that cross-country consumption correlations are {{higher than that of}} output in the model as opposed to data, has remained a central puzzle in international economics. In order to resolve this puzzle mainly two strategies: restrictions on asset trade, and introducing non-traded goods in the model, have been employed by researchers. While these extensions have been successful in closing the gap to some extent, the ordering of correlations has stayed unchanged: consumption correlations still exceed that of output. This paper attempts to resolve the quantity puzzle by introducing non-traded distribution costs in the retailing <b>of</b> <b>traded</b> goods. In a standard two-good model traded output and traded consumption, by definition, are identical goods. With distribution costs, traded output and consumption are two distinct entities as each <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> final <b>traded</b> consumption good incorporates a <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>traded</b> good and a fixed amount of non-traded goods. Thus, effectively, the model with distribution costs {{can be viewed as a}} model without distribution costs but with a modified utility function that has a substantially stronger complementarity between traded and non-traded goods. In a simple two-good extension of the Backus, Kehoe, and Kydland model, it is shown that the cross-country consumption and output correlations are 0. 55 and 0. 30, respectively, whereas with distribution costs consumption correlation reduces to 0. 09, output correlation to 0. 23. Incorporating distribution costs, in addition, improves the model’s performance in matching the volatility of real exchange rates and the correlation of net exports with output. These improvements are achieved without sacrificing the model's performance in any other dimension. open economy business cycles; quantity puzzle; distribution costs...|$|R

40|$|The current paper {{develops}} {{the idea of}} recognition in organizations, arguing that recognition is a fundamental building block of workplace dignity, and {{a key element of}} cultural respect in the workplace. Recognition perspectives begin with problems arising from viewing workers as commodities, and not recognizing their intrinsic dignity as social actors. Traditional economic views of human capital and human resources are particularly apt to view employees as units to be strategically managed, and not actors to be recognized, a situation which can both deteriorate the quality of their work and cause a series of psychological and interpersonal dysfunctions in the workplace. Such views are here termed reifying, because they view employees and their work as “thing-like ” <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade,</b> rather than as outcomes of the lived social experiences of actors trying to create works of value. The paper discusses the implications of reifying views of workers with the contrasting recognition view, using contemporary social theory on recognition to reconceive of the workplace as fundamentally social and dignifying. Finally, recognition views are applied to managerial practice, in the attempt to imagine the workplace in a way that combines practical action with the valuation of diverse individual and cultural experiences...|$|R
40|$|Emissions {{trading is}} {{regarded}} as a cost-effective tool to reduce greenhouse gases. For example, if the reduction cost <b>of</b> one <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> greenhouse gases (GHGs) in Japan is 10 and the cost in Russia is 1, and if each country must reduce one <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> GHGs respectively, then the total cost would be 11. On the other hand, if Russia reduces two units, then the cost would be 2. That is, Japan pays an amount of money between 1 and 10 to Russia, and asks Russia to reduce one <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> GHGs in return; this is called emissions <b>trading.</b> The sum <b>of</b> benefit and profit from emissions trading in the above example is 9 (= 10 + 1 - 2). If, for example, 0. 6 units are traded then the cost to Russia is 1 + 0. 6 = 1. 6 and the domestic reduction cost to Japan is (1 - 0. 6) 10 = 4. Therefore, the sum of benefit and profit for both countries becomes 5. 4 (= 11 - 1. 6 - 4). Since the maximum sum of benefit and profit is 9, the efficiency <b>of</b> 0. 6 <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>trading</b> becomes 5. 4 / 9 = 60 %. One of our concerns in emissions trading experiments is to determine what type of institutions would result in high efficacy. The above example describes simple trading. In order to attain further reductions, it is necessary to introduce reduction investment such as new instruments. “When” and “how” reduction investment is carried out is an important decision variables as well as trading.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to measure the {{sensitivity}} <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> volumes and <b>unit</b> values to agricultural productivity shocks at home and abroad. We find that the <b>unit</b> values <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> ows vary systematically with production shocks using both aggregate data on a large sample of countries and detailed firm-level imports to Sweden. We find that import prices increase (and import volumes fall) when importer production increases. This result is likely driven by a change in the quality composition of imports or by economies of scale in international trade. This beneficial terms-of-trade effect that we find may thus be an important coping mechanism for food net-importing countries that experience negative production shocks. Our results also suggest that trade volumes are relatively insensitive to changes in production.

Our empirical results confirm that tariff, distance, and wages all significantly affect the unit values.

Emissions trading schemes both implemented and proposed will be deconstructed to understand whether they will have a single uniform legal status within the WTO law, or indeed whether the legal status <b>of</b> the <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> will differ on a case-by-case basis. This book examines non-discrimination provisions and exceptions within four significant WTO ‘covered agreements’. This analysis will be undertaken with a goal to understand how emissions trading scheme measures may be labelled and treated by WTO dispute settlement bodies. Moreover, the narrative of this publication demonstrates where decisions must be made by WTO Members in relation to the legal treatment <b>of</b> emissions <b>trading</b> <b>units</b> and liabilities. 	 The aim of the book is to consider the issues associated with emissions trading that arise within the existing WTO law. This monograph will consider emissions trading schemes through the lens of WTO law to establish how these schemes will be defined, where they may potentially breach the non-discrimination provisions of the law and, whether the WTO law should be amended through Member agreement in order to accommodate these schemes. The book is an adaptation of a PhD thesis, which is an analysis <b>of</b> one emissions <b>trading</b> framework – the Australian Clean Energy Package – using WTO law as the theoretical framework. The aim of the proposed monograph is to increase the scope of analysis from the Clean Energy Package to emissions trading schemes more generally.
