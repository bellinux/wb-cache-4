40|$|The {{differential}} effect of illicit <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> on cognitive function in first-episode psychosis and healthy controls. Objective:? Illicit <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> {{can result in}} impairment in cognitive function in healthy individuals. Individuals with a psychotic disorder also show a deficit in cognitive function. <b>Drug</b> <b>use</b> may simply contribute to the characteristic cognitive deficit found in psychosis or alternatively result in a 'double deficit'. This study aims to investigate the association between <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> and cognitive function at the first-episode of psychosis and in community-matched controls. Method::? One hundred and seventy-seven patients at the first episode of psychosis completed a battery of neuropsychological tests. Those that had <b>used</b> <b>drugs</b> {{in the previous year}} (n?=? 80) were compared with those who had not <b>used</b> <b>drugs</b> in the previous year (n?=? 97). A subsample of the first-episode psychosis patients were compared with community-matched controls (n?=? 110) according to drug-use status. Results::? Patients with a first episode of psychosis who had <b>used</b> <b>drugs</b> performed equally to those who had not <b>used</b> <b>drugs</b> on neuropsychological tests. In contrast, healthy controls who had <b>used</b> <b>drugs</b> in the previous year performed worse on tests of executive function and working memory compared with those controls that had not <b>used</b> <b>drugs.</b> Conclusion:? There are differential associations of illicit drug misuse with cognitive function for first-episode psychosis patients and healthy controls...|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, many Olympic athletes began <b>using</b> <b>drugs</b> {{to improve their}} {{athletic}} abilities. For example, in 1904, Thomas Hicks, a gold medallist in the marathon, was given strychnine by his coach. The only Olympic death linked to performance enhancing occurred at the 1960 Rome games. A Danish cyclist, Knud Enemark Jensen, fell from his bicycle and later died. A coroner's inquiry {{found that he was}} under the influence of amphetamines. By the mid-1960s, sports federations started to ban the use of performance-enhancing drugs; in 1967 the IOC followed suit.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Because of {{the dangers}} {{in the nature of}} flight, pilots have to fly in perfect medical conditions. Besides the {{undesirable}} effects of the diseases, side effects of the medications used in the treatment might also risk flight safety. In this study, we investigated the <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> attitude of Turkish Armed Forces pilots. Material-Method: In order to investigate their <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> attitude, a questionnaire was given to 408 pilots at GATA Aerospace Medical Center. <b>Drug</b> <b>use</b> attitude, <b>drugs</b> <b>used</b> by pilots and side effects were questioned. Results: 41 % of pilots reported that they <b>used</b> <b>drugs</b> during active flying. But the <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> rate of Army pilots was 57 %, which was higher than the Air Force and Navy pilots. The most common <b>used</b> <b>drugs</b> were analgesics. Conclusion: It is obvious that pilots might <b>use</b> <b>drugs</b> without informing their flight surgeon. Flight surgeons should always educate the pilots about the importance and dangers of self-medication. [TAF Prev Med Bull 2004; 3 (9. 000) : 213 - 220...|$|R

Her associates in these criminal activities, who came from similarly dysfunctional backgrounds, provided her with a sense of belonging that she no longer found at home. Falle's mother had a series of boyfriends who abused her and made the house unsafe, so Falle ran away from home. She slept at friends' houses, on their couches and in tents in their backyards, concealing her presence from her friends' parents.|$|E

5|$|Lady Gaga: Queen of Pop has 288 pages, {{including}} 32 {{pages of}} photographs of the musician. The author compares Lady Gaga to Madonna, writing that both are independent and work to assert control over their futures.

Born Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta on March 28, 1986, from age 11 she attended Convent of the Sacred Heart high school; the same high school as Paris Hilton.

Germanotta gained entry to the Tisch School of the Arts in New York at age 17, but left and started <b>using</b> <b>drugs</b> while performing as a go-go dancer.
