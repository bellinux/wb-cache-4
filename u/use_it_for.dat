5|$|A 1,000-car {{above-ground}} parking garage, {{owned by}} the state, is located south of the stadium's center field entrance on Harrison Street between Fourth and Fifth Avenues. As the garage is used by state employees during the day, game attendees are only able to <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> evening and weekend games. Other state-owned free parking lots and paid private lots {{are located in the}} vicinity. The Metro Transit Authority's Music City Circuit provides bus service to and from a drop-off site at Fifth Avenue North and Harrison Street. Nashville BCycle, the city's bike-share program, has a station at First Tennessee Park.|$|E
5|$|After their father's {{death in}} 1906, Hogg and her {{brothers}} {{tried to sell}} the Varner plantation, but a provision in his will specified that the land be kept for 15years. On January 15, 1918, oil {{was found on the}} Varner plantation. A second strike the following year provided oil income amounting to $225,000 a month shared among the four siblings. According to Hogg biographer Gwendolyn Cone Neely, the Hoggs did not believe that the oil money was rightfully theirs, as it had come from the land and not hard work, and they were determined to <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> the good of Texas.|$|E
5|$|As Oregon City {{was founded}} and European {{settlers}} began {{moving to the}} area, they petitioned their governments to remove the local natives from the land, so that the settlers could <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> farming and housing.

5|$|Despite being {{originally}} {{intended as a}} defensive weapon for military personnel whose primary role is not fighting with small arms (such as vehicle drivers), most sales of the P90 have been to special forces and counter-terrorist groups who <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> offensive roles. The P90 first saw operational use in the 1991 Gulf War, where it {{was used by the}} Belgian special forces group.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes {{that contain}} a {{catalytic}} triad <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> {{one of two}} reaction types: either to split a substrate (hydrolases) or to transfer one portion of a substrate over to a second substrate (transferases). Triads are an inter-dependent set of residues in the active site of an enzyme and act in concert with other residues (e.g. binding site and oxyanion hole) to achieve nucleophilic catalysis. These triad residues act together to make the nucleophile member highly reactive, generating a covalent intermediate with the substrate that is then resolved to complete catalysis.|$|E
5|$|However, Paramount {{rejected}} the track, believing that Leonard {{was incapable of}} creating the score for the film. Leonard later presented the instrumental to Madonna, who decided to <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> At Close Range, the new film starring her then-husband, actor Sean Penn. Madonna wrote all the lyrics, added some melodies to the composition, and recorded a demo on a cassette. She presented the track to the film's director James Foley, who liked it and enlisted Leonard to compose the film's score, as suggested by Madonna.|$|E
50|$|This plant had {{a number}} of {{medicinal}} uses for Native American groups. The Cherokee people <b>used</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> nausea. The Choctaw people <b>used</b> <b>it</b> as a remedy for snakebite and gonorrhea, and the Delaware people <b>used</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> intestinal worms. Many groups made it into tea to treat gastrointestinal complaints. The Koasati attributed magical powers to the plant.|$|R

5|$|In 1881, the {{committee}} from the Discharged Prisoner’s Aid Society asked {{to use the}} building when {{it was not in}} use for discharged female convicts from the prison at Carliol Square (1828–1925) to do laundry work and the Society continued to <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> this purpose until the turn of the century. Between 1882 and 1883 City Road was built over the front lawn of the Hospital.|$|E
5|$|The game uses SoundFonts {{to provide}} {{additional}} ambient sound effects. A Sound Blaster AWE32 or AWE64 is required to use this feature. The player can load a SoundFont and <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> ambient sound effects. Customised SoundFonts can be created to personalise the dungeon. The game features three SoundFonts, {{one of which is}} loaded at game startup, and Creative offered sample Dungeon Keeper SoundFonts for download.|$|E
5|$|The {{mushroom}} is edible, {{with a mild}} {{taste and}} a slight odor of maple syrup. American author David Arora suggests that the fruit bodies {{may be used in}} a manner similar to the candy cap mushrooms, despite being not as fragrant.

5|$|When {{drawing the}} characters, Kishimoto {{consistently}} follows a five-step process: concept and rough sketch, drafting, inking, shading, and coloring. These steps are followed {{when he is}} drawing the manga and making the color illustrations that commonly adorn the cover of tankōbon, {{the cover of the}} Weekly Shōnen Jump, or other media, but the toolkit he uses occasionally changes. For instance, he used an airbrush for one illustration for a Weekly Shōnen Jump cover, but decided not to <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> future drawings largely due to the cleanup required.|$|E
5|$|Decommissioned in 1949, {{the fort}} {{was used for}} a time as a {{storehouse}} for a shoe factory before it was purchased by the local council. The surrounding land was developed into a public park but the fort itself fell into dereliction, despite its historical and architectural significance. Since 1985 it has been leased to a voluntary preservation group, the Coalhouse Fort Project, which has been working to restore the fort and <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> heritage and educational purposes. It can be visited by the public on regular open days and houses reconstructions, small military museums and open-air displays of military equipment. Funding for its restoration has been provided {{in part by the}} Heritage Lottery Fund and the Warner Bros. film studio, which used the fort as a location for the opening scenes of the 2005 film Batman Begins.|$|E
50|$|Nine Mile Prairie is now {{administered}} by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The university <b>uses</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> a variety of research and recreational purposes, especially for studies of prairie ecology.

5|$|Henry re-granted Pevensey Castle to Gilbert I de l'Aigle but {{continued}} to <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> his own purposes, as happened in 1101 when he spent the summer at Pevensey to deter a threatened invasion by Duke Robert of Normandy. Pevensey was confiscated again by the Crown under King Stephen, with Gilbert's family also losing {{the rest of their}} possessions. It was subsequently re-granted to Gilbert de Clare, 1st Earl of Pembroke, who switched his allegiance to Stephen's cousin and rival, the Empress Matilda, in 1141. Although Gilbert changed his loyalty back to Stephen the following year, he was taken hostage by the king in 1147 after a revolt by Gilbert's uncle, Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester. A promise to surrender the Clare family's castles secured Gilbert's release but {{as soon as he was}} freed, he too rebelled. In response, Stephen undertook the second siege of Pevensey Castle with a land and sea blockade. The castle once again proved impervious to direct assault but the garrison was eventually starved out.|$|E
5|$|Some teams made {{modifications}} to their cars {{in preparation for}} the event. Ferrari, Mercedes and Renault introduced diffuser designs similar to the Red Bull RB6. Ferrari's design largely changed the shape of their exhaust system, and introduced a new gearbox case for Massa's car to raise the pick-up points of its rear suspension to help him adjust to the changes. They constructed a larger radiator to deal with the additional heat. Mercedes elected not to bring a new gearbox casing, but introduced a new rear diffuser to fully utilise the air blowing from the car's exhaust. Renault's design had the exit of their car's exhaust which had thermal protection against high temperatures and the team introduced a new design of their gearbox casing to allow for the pick-up points for its rear suspension to be accommodated. After running the F-duct device (which increases a car's top speed) in Friday practice, Red Bull decided to <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> the remainder of the weekend.|$|E
5|$|Square trademarked Seiken Densetsu in , {{intending}} to <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> a game project subtitled The Emergence of Excalibur, {{and led by}} Kazuhiko Aoki for the Famicom Disk System. According to early advertisements, the game would consist of an unprecedented five floppy disks, {{making it one of}} the largest titles developed for the Famicom up until that point. Although Square solicited pre-orders for the game, Kaoru Moriyama, a former Square employee, affirms that management canceled the ambitious project before it advanced beyond the early planning stages. In October 1987, customers who had placed orders were sent a letter informing them of the cancellation and had their purchases refunded. The letter also suggested to consider placing an order on another upcoming Square role-playing game in a similar vein: Final Fantasy.|$|E

5|$|The Emperor's flagship, Grig Orig, destroys Zoah, but the Black Fleet {{intervenes}} before Edge and {{the dragon}} are killed. At the Tower, Craymen tells Edge {{it is one}} of several that manufacture monsters to combat humanity's destructive forces. He needs Azel to activate the Tower and destroy the Empire before they can <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> themselves. Imperials arrive and capture Edge and Craymen. After the Emperor forces Azel to activate the Tower, monsters emerge and kill Craymen, the Emperor, and their men. Edge and Azel escape on Edge's dragon. At the Seeker stronghold, Gash explains that the Tower will destroy humanity if it is not deactivated. He believes Edge's dragon is the prophesied Divine Visitor who will be humanity's salvation. Edge and the dragon battle rampaging monsters and destroy the infested Grig Orig.|$|E
5|$|The GDR emblem {{was removed}} from over the main {{entrance}} in 1990, the year of reunification, leaving a dark patch. Following reunification, the Berlin offices of the German Chancellery and the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs moved into the building. In January 1993, after a legal decision, the Federal Government returned the building to the Federal State of Berlin, which wished to <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> its original purpose of city administration. However, it first urgently required refurbishment; under the GDR, upkeep had been neglected and the plumbing facilities, for example, dated {{in part to the}} 1920s. Access also needed to be provided for the handicapped.|$|E
5|$|The Oakwood City Council {{wanted the}} Playhouse as a {{community}} center. Thomas appeared before the council and assured them {{that it would not}} be damaged, although he could not disclose what he was intending to <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>for.</b> When Talbott Realty proved reluctant to sell, the United States Army Corps of Engineers condemned the property, which became Unit IV on 15 February 1944. Remodeling began on 17 March and the Production Group began moving in on 1 June. Three guard houses were added, along with a wire fence. Changes to the site were minimized in order to make it easier to restore later. Because it was located in a residential area, efforts were also made to minimize noise and other disruptions.|$|E
