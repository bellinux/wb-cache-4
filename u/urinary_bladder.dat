5|$|There are two kidneys located dorsally, {{near the}} roof of the body cavity. Their job is to filter the blood of {{metabolic}} waste and transport the urine via ureters to the <b>urinary</b> <b>bladder</b> where it is stored before being passed out periodically through the cloacal vent. Larvae and most aquatic adult amphibians excrete the nitrogen as ammonia in large quantities of dilute urine, while terrestrial species, with a greater need to conserve water, excrete the less toxic product urea. Some tree frogs with limited access to water excrete most of their metabolic waste as uric acid.|$|E
5|$|Amphetamine {{stimulates the}} {{medullary}} respiratory centers, producing faster and deeper breaths. In {{a normal person}} at therapeutic doses, this effect is usually not noticeable, but when respiration is already compromised, it may be evident. Amphetamine also induces contraction in the <b>urinary</b> <b>bladder</b> sphincter, the muscle which controls urination, which can result in difficulty urinating. This effect {{can be useful in}} treating bed wetting and loss of bladder control. The effects of amphetamine on the gastrointestinal tract are unpredictable. If intestinal activity is high, amphetamine may reduce gastrointestinal motility (the rate at which content moves through the digestive system); however, amphetamine may increase motility when the smooth muscle of the tract is relaxed. Amphetamine also has a slight analgesic effect and can enhance the pain relieving effects of opioids.|$|E
5|$|Although {{adapted to}} {{terrestrial}} life, frogs resemble freshwater fish in {{their inability to}} conserve body water effectively. When they are on land, much water is lost by evaporation from the skin. The excretory system {{is similar to that}} of mammals and there are two kidneys that remove nitrogenous products from the blood. Frogs produce large quantities of dilute urine in order to flush out toxic products from the kidney tubules. The nitrogen is excreted as ammonia by tadpoles and aquatic frogs but mainly as urea, a less toxic product, by most terrestrial adults. A few species of tree frog with little access to water excrete the even less toxic uric acid. The urine passes along paired ureters to the <b>urinary</b> <b>bladder</b> from which it is vented periodically into the cloaca. All bodily wastes exit the body through the cloaca which terminates in a cloacal vent.|$|E

40|$|We have {{identified}} a group of proteins (Mr approximately 70 000 - 80 000; pI approximately 5. 5 - 6. 0) in giant-toad (Bufo marinus) <b>urinary</b> <b>bladders</b> whose synthesis appears {{to be related to}} aldosterone-stimulated Na+ transport. Spironolactone, a specific mineralocorticoid antagonist in renal epithelia, inhibits the synthesis of these proteins as well as the natriferic effect of the hormone. Since a variety of other steroids (some of which are traditionally considered to be glucocorticoids) also stimulate Na+ transport in toad <b>urinary</b> <b>bladders,</b> we examined whether their natriferic activity was expressed in a fashion similar to that of aldosterone. Short-circuit current was used to measure Na+ transport, and epithelial-cell protein synthesis was detected with high-resolution two-dimensional polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. At a concentration of approximately 100 nM, dexamethasone, corticosterone and aldosterone were equinatriferic. Dexamethasone and aldosterone had identical dose-response curves, maximal and half-maximal activity being evident at concentrations of approximately 100 nM and 10 nM respectively. In contrast, at a concentration of approximately 10 nM, corticosterone had no effect on Na+ transport. The natriferic activities of these three steroids correlate with their known affinities for the putative mineralocorticoid receptor in toad <b>urinary</b> <b>bladders.</b> Natriferic concentrations of dexamethasone and corticosterone (140 nM) induced the synthesis of proteins with characteristics identical with those induced by aldosterone. Spironolactone, at an antagonist/agonist ratio of 2000 : 1, inhibited steroid-induced Na+ transport and the synthesis of these proteins. Thus it appears that all natriferic steroids share a common mechanism of action in toad <b>urinary</b> <b>bladders.</b> Natriferic activity can be correlated not only with relative steroid-receptor affinity but also with the induction of a specific group of epithelial-cell proteins...|$|R

5|$|Amphibians are a {{class of}} animals {{comprising}} frogs, salamanders and caecilians. They are tetrapods, but the caecilians and a few species of salamander have either no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their main bones are hollow and lightweight and are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock {{with each other and}} have articular processes. Their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae. Their skulls are mostly broad and short, and are often incompletely ossified. Their skin contains little keratin and lacks scales, but contains many mucous glands and in some species, poison glands. The hearts of amphibians have three chambers, two atria and one ventricle. They have a <b>urinary</b> <b>bladder</b> and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as urea. Amphibians breathe by means of buccal pumping, a pump action in which air is first drawn into the buccopharyngeal region through the nostrils. These are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat. They supplement this with gas exchange through the skin which needs to be kept moist.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians are ectothermic (cold-blooded) {{vertebrates}} that do {{not maintain}} their body temperature through internal physiological processes. Their metabolic rate is low and as a result, their food and energy requirements are limited. In the adult state, they have tear ducts and movable eyelids, and most species have ears that can detect airborne or ground vibrations. They have muscular tongues, which in many species can be protruded. Modern amphibians have fully ossified vertebrae with articular processes. Their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae. Their skulls are mostly broad and short, and are often incompletely ossified. Their skin contains little keratin and lacks scales, apart from a few fish-like scales in certain caecilians. The skin contains many mucous glands and in some species, poison glands (a type of granular gland). The hearts of amphibians have three chambers, two atria and one ventricle. They have a <b>urinary</b> <b>bladder</b> and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as urea. Most amphibians lay their eggs in water and have aquatic larvae that undergo metamorphosis to become terrestrial adults.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purposes}} of this study were to investigate the effect of hormonal alterations on the expression of caveolin- 1 in the <b>urinary</b> <b>bladders</b> of ovariectomized rats and to determine the role of caveolin- 1 in the overactivity of the detrusor muscle that occurs with hormonal alterations in rats. Methods: Female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups: a control group, a group that underwent bilateral ovariectomy (Ovx), and a group that underwent bilateral ovariectomy followed by subcutaneous injections of 17 β-estradiol (Ovx+ Est). After 4 weeks, urodynamic studies were done to measure the contraction interval and contraction pressure. The expression and cellular localization of caveolin- 1 were determined by Western blot and immunofluorescence in the <b>urinary</b> <b>bladders</b> of rats. Results: On cystometrograms, the contraction interval was significantly shorter in the Ovx group (3. 0 ± 0. 3 minute) than in the control group (5. 6 ± 0. 5 minute) but was longer in the Ovx+Est group (9. 2 ± 0. 4 minute) (P< 0. 05). Conversely, the average contraction pressure was higher in the Ovx group (26. 4 ± 0. 48 mmHg) than in the control group (21. 8 ± 0. 37 mmHg) but was lower in the Ovx+Est group (23. 9 ± 0. 76 mmHg) (P< 0. 05). Caveolin- 1 was expressed in the capillaries, arterioles, and venules. Expression of the protein caveolin- 1 was significantly lower after ovariectomy and was restored to control levels after treatment with 17 β-estradiol (P< 0. 05). Conclusions: Hormonal alterations cause a significant change in the expression of caveolin- 1, which suggests that caveolin- 1 might have a functional role in the overactivity of the detrusor muscle related to hormonal alterations in the <b>urinary</b> <b>bladders</b> of rats.

25|$|BPV-4 causes {{squamous}} cell carcinomas of the alimentary tract, and BPV-1/2 causes carcinomas and haemangioendotheliomas of the <b>urinary</b> <b>bladder,</b> {{in both cases}} in animals that have fed on bracken (Pteridium aquilinum). Such cancers are common in locations where grazing land is infested with bracken, such as the western Scottish Highlands, southern Italy and the Nasampolai Valley in Kenya. Bracken contains several immunosuppressants and mutagens, including quercetin and ptaquiloside. Consumption of large quantities by cattle leads to an acute poisoning syndrome with symptoms of bone marrow depletion, while at lower levels of long-term consumption it acts as a cancer cofactor. Carcinogenesis is a multistep process; tumours also contain activated Ras, as well as mutation or downregulation of the tumour suppressor genes p53 in alimentary tract cancers and fragile histidine tetrads (FHIT) in <b>urinary</b> <b>bladder</b> cancers.
