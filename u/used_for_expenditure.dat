40|$|Purpose: States are {{increasingly}} using the Medicaid 1915 c waiver program to provide community-based long-term care. A substantially {{greater share of}} long-term-care dollars supports community-based care for individuals with intellectual and developmental dis-abilities, relative to older and working-age persons with primarily physical disabilities. Design and Methods: We <b>used</b> state-level data <b>for</b> the period from 1992 to 2001 to estimate fixed-effects panel models. We compared state predictors of waiver utilization and <b>expenditures</b> <b>for</b> waivers serving both older and working-age individuals (O/WAIs) relative to waivers serving individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs). Results: We found community-based-care capacity to predict <b>use</b> and <b>expenditures</b> <b>for</b> both target groups. Although regulation of institutional supply was positively re-lated to <b>expenditure</b> measures <b>for</b> IDDs, it {{was not related to}} <b>use</b> or <b>expenditures</b> <b>for</b> O/WAIs. Demand variables (e. g., the size of a state’s African American population) predicted <b>use</b> and <b>expenditures</b> <b>for</b> IDD waivers, but they were less consistent for O/WAI waivers. State resources were a robust predictor of <b>use</b> and <b>expenditures</b> <b>for</b> both groups. Implications: In-creased community-based-care capacity appears to be an important factor in efforts to expand the availability of Medicaid community-based care. Federal policies that address state resource issues may also spur growth in community-based long-term care.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the status of}} women in Kenyan households. It finds that low-income women, particularly those in rural areas, have limited household bargaining power and freedom to make independent decisions. This is significantly linked to the substantial barriers to female land ownership. Women are insufficiently compensated for their labour on male-owned farms, and face limited non-farm income-earning opportunities. Women’s disempowerment in the household may have negative implications for family welfare. Agricultural revenues accrued directly to men are frequently <b>used</b> <b>for</b> personal <b>expenditure</b> rather than family needs. Furthermore, an econometric analysis of personal expenditure presented in this paper reveals that children are not treated equally in households where women have little or no bargaining power. It is recommended that Kenya pursue land reform and take steps to improve women’s access to and control of income...|$|R
