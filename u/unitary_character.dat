5000|$|The {{unitary patent}} for Switzerland and Liechtenstein is a patent having a <b>unitary</b> <b>character</b> over the territories of Switzerland and Liechtenstein. It {{can either be}} a {{national}} patent, or a European patent granted under the European Patent Convention (EPC) and having a <b>unitary</b> <b>character</b> pursuant to [...] The unitary patent [...] "may only be granted, transferred, annulled or lapse in respect of the whole territory of protection," [...] i.e. for both Switzerland and Liechtenstein.|$|E

50|$|This {{group is}} {{referred}} to as the character group of G. Sometimes only <b>unitary</b> <b>characters</b> are considered (thus the image is in the unit circle); other such homomorphisms are then called quasi-characters. Dirichlet characters can be seen as a special case of this definition.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to the unified, regional character of a European patent application, the granted European patent does not comprise, in effect, any such <b>unitary</b> <b>character,</b> except for the opposition procedure. In other words, one European patent in one Contracting State is effectively independent of the same European patent in each other Contracting State, except for the opposition procedure.|$|E

5000|$|After grant, the European patent {{in force}} in Switzerland and Liechtenstein—in {{the same manner}} as a [...] "national" [...] patent in Switzerland and Liechtenstein— has a truly <b>unitary</b> <b>character.</b> It can only be transferred, revoked or lapse for both states at the same time. It has also the same effect in both countries.

5000|$|This {{definition}} {{depends on}} {{the definition of a}} character, which varies slightly between authors: It may be defined as a homomorphism to the non-zero complex numbers (also called a [...] "quasicharacter"), or as a homomorphism to the unit circle in C ("unitary"). Any quasicharacter (of the idele class group) can be written uniquely as a <b>unitary</b> <b>character</b> times a real power of the norm, so there is no big difference between the two definitions.|$|E
50|$|In applications, one can rarely sum {{exactly the}} Magnus series {{and one has}} to {{truncate}} it to get approximate solutions. The main advantage of the Magnus proposal is that the truncated series very often shares important qualitative properties with the exact solution, at variance with other conventional perturbation theories. For instance, in classical mechanics the symplectic character of the time evolution is preserved at every order of approximation. Similarly the <b>unitary</b> <b>character</b> of the time evolution operator in quantum mechanics is also preserved (in contrast, e.g., to the Dyson series solving the same problem).|$|E

As a corollary we reobtain the alternating sum formula.

50|$|After the Velvet Divorce, laws about {{citizenship}} became clearer {{with the}} new constitutions. During the Soviet Regime, {{there was not much}} place for the rule of law. The rights and duties of citizens were similar to other socialist states, an included the right to serve in the military and the right to work. If the citizens clearly had no recognized political rights, they were, however, able to organize and get some political impact through the civil society, highly developed in Czechoslovakia. Moreover, the Beneš Decrees were very discriminatory against the German and Hungarian minorities of Czechoslovakia, who could not be granted citizenship. Emphasis was thus put on the <b>unitary</b> <b>character</b> of Czechoslovakia.|$|E
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the unified character of a European patent application, a granted European patent has, in effect, no <b>unitary</b> <b>character,</b> except for the centralized opposition procedure (which can be initiated within 9 months from grant, by somebody else than the patent proprietor), and the centralized limitation and revocation procedures (which can only be instituted by the patent proprietor). In other words, a European patent in one Contracting State, i.e. a [...] "national" [...] European patent, is effectively independent of the same European patent in each other Contracting State, except for the opposition, limitation and revocation procedures. The enforcement of a European patent is dealt with by national law. The abandonment, revocation or limitation of the European patent in one state {{does not affect the}} European patent in other states.|$|E
50|$|Eventually, the Union of Lublin of 1569 {{created a}} new state, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In this federation, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania {{maintained}} its political distinctiveness and had separate government, laws, army, and treasury. This federation was terminated by {{the passing of the}} Constitution of May 3, 1791, and since then there {{was supposed to be a}} single country - Respublica Poloniae - under one monarch and one parliament. Shortly after, the <b>unitary</b> <b>character</b> of the state was confirmed by adopting the Reciprocal Guarantee of Two Nations. The newly reformed Commonwealth was invaded by Russia in 1792 and partitioned between the neighbours, with a truncated state (principal cities being Kraków, Warsaw and Vilnius) remaining only nominally independent. After the Kościuszko Uprising, the territory was partitioned among the Russian Empire, the Kingdom of Prussia, and Austria in 1795.|$|E
40|$|We {{prove the}} nonvanishing of the twisted central {{critical}} {{values of a}} class of automorphic L-functions for twists by all but finitely many <b>unitary</b> <b>characters</b> in particular infinite families.

This is one of the articles that gave the Indian constitution some amount of <b>unitary</b> <b>character.</b> Though {{the purpose of this article}} is to give more powers to central government to preserve the unity and integrity of the nation, it has often been misused [...] by the ruling parties at the center. It has been used as a pretext to dissolve state governments ruled by political opponents. [...] Thus, it is seen by many as a threat to the federal state system. Since the adoption of Indian constitution in 1950, the central government has used this article several times to dissolve elected state governments and impose President's rule.|$|E
5000|$|... "The {{first part}} {{describes}} emanation of all supernatural entities from their primal source. It {{begins with the}} Father, described primarily as through a via negativa as an utterly transcendent entity. What can be affirmed {{is that he is}} unique and monadic. The insistence on the <b>unitary</b> <b>character</b> of the Father distinguishes the text from most other Valentinians who posit a primal masculine feminine dyad, although some members of the school, such as those mentioned by Hippolytus, also hold to a monadic first principle." [...] The godhead is thus, less complex. The Son and the Church (Ekkeslia) then emanate from the Father. Rather than an ogdoad, a trinity is affirmed. While Eusebius of Caesarea mentions that Valentinus taught a trinity in his work 'on the three natures', this was likely a trinity of natures in one godhead rather than three persons.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAs a {{first step}} towards a duality theory for central quasigroups, the paper {{presents}} an explicit computation of the characters of a central pique (quasigroup with pointed idempotent) using Wigner's “little groups” method. The characters of a central pique's cloop (principally isotopic abelian group) form a dual pique. The conjugacy classes of the dual correspond to the characters of the primal; indeed the <b>unitary</b> <b>character</b> table of the dual is the inverse of the <b>unitary</b> <b>character</b> table of the primal. Together with its dual, a central pique forms a structure known as the double. The double satisfies identities indexed by loops of 2 -power order.
