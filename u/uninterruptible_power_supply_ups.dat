40|$|This thesis {{examines}} issues {{connected to}} safe <b>uninterruptible</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies.</b> The term safe <b>uninterruptible</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> {{is used for}} an aggregate of devices providing power for appliances that participate in safe rapid shutdown of a power plant in case power from a usual source fails. The thesis {{is divided into two}} parts – theoretical and practical. Theoretical part deals with possibilities and ways of realizing an aggregation of safe <b>uninterruptible</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> Various devices that can appear in the section of a safe <b>uninterruptible</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> are listed and each device is characterized. Appliances that can be provided for by the sources of safe <b>uninterruptible</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> are mentioned as well. These appliances are listed in accordance with ČSN standard nr. 381120. The theoretical part concludes with new trends in realization of safe <b>uninterruptible</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies.</b> One of these sources is a clean source technology that can also be implemented in various ways. Practical part contains a suggestion of a safe <b>uninterruptible</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> for particular steam power plant. This suggested safe <b>uninterruptible</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> consists of rectifiers, batteries, inverters and a dieselgenerator. Calculated parameters of each device {{at the conclusion of the}} practical part are followed by a diagram of the suggested section of safe <b>uninterruptible</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply...</b>|$|R
