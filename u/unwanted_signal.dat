25|$|Historically {{the term}} {{aliasing}} evolved from radio engineering {{because of the}} action of superheterodyne receivers. When the receiver shifts multiple signals down to lower frequencies, from RF to IF by heterodyning, an <b>unwanted</b> <b>signal,</b> from an RF frequency equally far from the local oscillator (LO) frequency as the desired signal, but {{on the wrong side}} of the LO, can end up at the same IF frequency as the wanted one. If it is strong enough it can interfere with reception of the desired signal. This <b>unwanted</b> <b>signal</b> is known as an image or alias of the desired signal.|$|E
25|$|A single voxel's {{response}} signal {{over time}} is called its timecourse. Typically, the <b>unwanted</b> <b>signal,</b> called the noise, from the scanner, random brain activity and similar elements {{is as big}} as the signal itself. To eliminate these, fMRI studies repeat a stimulus presentation multiple times.|$|E
2500|$|Once {{the signal}} arrives (via the [...] "snake" [...] cable) at a channel on the mixing console, this signal can be {{adjusted}} {{in many ways by}} the sound engineer. A signal can be equalized (e.g., by adjusting the bass or treble of the sound), compressed (to avoid <b>unwanted</b> <b>signal</b> peaks), or panned (that is sent to the left or right speakers) before being routed to an output bus. [...] The signal may also be routed into an external effects processor, such as a reverb effect, which outputs a wet (effected) version of the signal, which is typically mixed in varying amounts with the dry (effect-free) signal. Many electronic effects units are used in sound reinforcement systems, including digital delay and reverb. Some concerts use pitch correction effects (e.g., AutoTune), which electronically correct any out-of-tune singing.|$|E
50|$|When VF and the {{aural signal}} {{modulate}} the same carrier the inevitable non-linearity {{of the electronic}} circuits cause <b>unwanted</b> <b>signals</b> which are called intermodulation products. The <b>unwanted</b> <b>signals</b> appear on RF spectrum at regular intervals, the interval being equal to the frequency difference of the visual and aural carriers.|$|R
25|$|Radar systems must {{overcome}} <b>unwanted</b> <b>signals</b> {{in order to}} focus on the targets of interest. These <b>unwanted</b> <b>signals</b> may originate from internal and external sources, both passive and active. The ability of the radar system to overcome these <b>unwanted</b> <b>signals</b> defines its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). SNR is defined as the ratio of the signal power to the noise power within the desired signal; it compares the level of a desired target signal to the level of background noise (atmospheric noise and noise generated within the receiver). The higher a system's SNR the better it is at discriminating actual targets from noise signals.|$|R
50|$|A {{different}} {{technique is}} called a coronagraph, using a physical obstacle to block the <b>unwanted</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Once {{the audio}} {{engineer}} has {{made all the}} adjustments to a signal (e.g., the lead vocalist's singing through a microphone), such as equalization, adding effects, and so on, the signal is then electronically routed to {{a section of the}} mixing console known as [...] "bus", also called a [...] "mix group", [...] "subgroup" [...] or simply [...] "group". A group of signals may be routed through an additional bus before being sent to the main bus to allow the engineer to control the levels of several related signals at once. [...] For example, all of the different microphones for a drum set might be sent to their own bus so that the volume of the entire drum set sound can be controlled with a single fader or a pair of faders, rather than the audio engineer having to adjust all of the different drums and cymbals' mic volumes. A bus can often be processed just like an individual input channel, allowing the engineer to process a whole group of signals at once. Once again using the drum kit example, the use of bus-processing can enable the sound engineer to run all of the drum kit through an audio compressor effect to reduce <b>unwanted</b> <b>signal</b> peaks, rather than having to route all of the 10 or more mic signals on the drum kit individually.|$|E
50|$|In digital photography, a bias {{frame is}} an image {{obtained}} from an opto-electronic image sensor, with no actual exposure time. The image so obtained only contains <b>unwanted</b> <b>signal</b> due to the electronics that elaborate the sensor data, and not <b>unwanted</b> <b>signal</b> from charge accumulation (e.g. from dark current) within the sensor itself.|$|E

5000|$|Noise {{refers to}} {{many types of}} random or <b>unwanted</b> <b>signals,</b> most {{commonly}} acoustic noise, but also including the following: ...|$|R
25|$|In communications, multiple-access schemes are {{orthogonal}} when {{an ideal}} receiver can completely reject arbitrarily strong <b>unwanted</b> <b>signals</b> from the desired signal using different basis functions. One such scheme is TDMA, where the orthogonal basis functions are nonoverlapping rectangular pulses ("time slots").|$|R
50|$|In signal theory, {{the noise}} floor is {{the measure of the}} signal created from the sum of all the noise sources and <b>unwanted</b> <b>signals</b> within a {{measurement}} system, where noise is defined as any signal other than the one being monitored.|$|R

50|$|In FM systems {{where the}} IF stage gain {{is very high}} and the stage is {{designed}} to be linear, it is likely that if the <b>unwanted</b> <b>signal</b> is at least 10 dB weaker than the wanted signal that the capture effect will result in the receiver ignoring the <b>unwanted</b> <b>signal.</b> If however the <b>unwanted</b> <b>signal</b> is stronger than the wanted signal then {{it is likely that the}} receiver will be unable to demodulate the wanted signal. This is related to the normal method of jamming FM systems, to jam an FM signal it is normal to transmit a signal which is 10 dB stronger (at the front end of the target receiver) and is within the plateau of most narrow IF stage.|$|E
5000|$|The {{signal-to-crosstalk ratio}} at a {{specified}} {{point in a}} circuit is {{the ratio of the}} power of the wanted signal to the power of the <b>unwanted</b> <b>signal</b> from another channel.|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: The diagram shows a {{band-pass filter}} {{used to reduce}} the base station receiver's {{exposure}} to <b>unwanted</b> <b>signals.</b> It also reduces the transmission of undesired signals. The isolator is a one-way device which reduces the ease of signals from nearby transmitters going up the antenna line and into the base station transmitter. This prevents the <b>unwanted</b> mixing of <b>signals</b> inside the base station transmitter which can generate interference.|$|R
50|$|IF {{amplifiers}} {{can change}} the frequency levels in circuits that are too selective, difficult to tune, and unstable. It also helps by changing the frequency levels in circuits which improve image display and tuning range. It is a fixed frequency amplifier which rejects <b>unwanted</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|R

50|$|While {{all types}} of {{asbestos}} fibers are known to cause serious health hazards in humans, {{it is not known}} whether its toxicity is due to mechanical damage or <b>unwanted</b> <b>signal</b> channels which might disrupt normal cell activity.|$|E
5000|$|For notch filters, {{the degree}} to which <b>unwanted</b> <b>signals</b> at the notch {{frequency}} must be rejected determines the accuracy of the components, but not the Q, which is governed by desired steepness of the notch, i.e. the bandwidth around the notch before attenuation becomes small.|$|R
5000|$|In {{communications}} and electronics, especially in telecommunications, interference is anything which modifies, or disrupts a signal as it travels along a channel between a source and a receiver. The term typically {{refers to the}} addition of <b>unwanted</b> <b>signals</b> to a useful signal. Common examples are: ...|$|R
50|$|Since each user generates MAI, {{controlling}} the signal strength {{is an important}} issue with CDMA transmitters. A CDM (synchronous CDMA), TDMA, or FDMA receiver can in theory completely reject arbitrarily strong signals using different codes, time slots or frequency channels due to the orthogonality of these systems. This is not true for asynchronous CDMA; rejection of <b>unwanted</b> <b>signals</b> is only partial. If any or all of the <b>unwanted</b> <b>signals</b> are much stronger than the desired signal, they will overwhelm it. This leads to a general requirement in any asynchronous CDMA system to approximately match the various signal power levels as seen at the receiver. In CDMA cellular, the base station uses a fast closed-loop power-control scheme to tightly control each mobile's transmit power.|$|R
5000|$|Reinforce {{the shield}} {{of the signal}} cable {{connecting}} C1 and C2 by connecting a thick copper conductor in parallel to the shield. This reduces {{the resistance of the}} shield and thus the amplitude of the <b>unwanted</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
50|$|It is {{possible}} for the <b>unwanted</b> <b>signal</b> to enter an Intermediate frequency stage, and if it falls within the passband of the stage, it can cause an unwanted effect. In an AM system, it {{is possible}} that the <b>unwanted</b> <b>signal</b> will be amplified by the linear stage and appear finally to the detector as if it were a sideband of the carrier, it is possible sometimes for harmonics of an HF transmitter generated within a TV set to enter the video IF (which is at about 30 MHz). These harmonics which enter the TV IF could give similar herring bone pattern effects to those seen when harmonics of the HF transmitter are generated in the front end.|$|E
50|$|A single voxel's {{response}} signal {{over time}} is called its timecourse. Typically, the <b>unwanted</b> <b>signal,</b> called the noise, from the scanner, random brain activity and similar elements {{is as big}} as the signal itself.

50|$|All {{forms of}} CDMA use {{spread-spectrum}} process gain to allow receivers to partially discriminate against <b>unwanted</b> <b>signals.</b> Signals encoded with the specified PN sequence (code) are received, while signals with different codes (or the same code but a different timing offset) appear as wideband noise {{reduced by the}} process gain.|$|R
50|$|Pulse-Doppler radar {{uses the}} {{following}} signal processing criteria to exclude <b>unwanted</b> <b>signals</b> from slow-moving objects. This {{is also known}} as clutter rejection. Rejection velocity is usually set just above the prevailing wind speed (10 to 100 mile/hour or 15 to 150 km/hour). The velocity threshold is much lower for weather radar.|$|R
5000|$|Nulling {{interferometry}} {{is a type}} of interferometry {{in which}} two or more signals are mixed to produce observational regions in which the incoming signals cancel themselves out. This creates a set of virtual [...] "blind spots" [...] which prevent <b>unwanted</b> <b>signals</b> from those areas from interfering with weaker nearby signals.|$|R
50|$|Mobile CDN {{coined the}} term the ''''mobile mile'''' to {{categorize}} the last mile connection when a wireless systems is used to reach the customer. In contrast to wired delivery systems, wireless systems use unguided waves to transmit ICE. They all tend to be unshielded and have {{a greater degree of}} susceptibility to <b>unwanted</b> <b>signal</b> and noise sources.|$|E
50|$|A {{bridge tap}} has no hybrid coil or other {{impedance}} matching components, just a “T” (or branch) in the cable. Thus the bridge presents an impedance mismatch. The unused {{branch of the}} T is usually left with no device connected to its end, thus has no electrical termination. Both the tap and its unterminated branch cause <b>unwanted</b> <b>signal</b> reflections, also called echoes.|$|E
5000|$|Gain {{compression}} {{is relevant}} in any {{system with a}} wide dynamic range, such as audio or RF. It {{is more common in}} tube circuits than transistor circuits, due to topology differences, possibly causing the differences in audio performance called [...] "valve sound". The front-end RF amps of radio receivers are particularly susceptible to this phenomenon when overloaded by a strong <b>unwanted</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
