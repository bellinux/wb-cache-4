All international Legacy, except the USA, had front seat adjustable anchor shoulder belts.|$|E
40|$|A {{sequence}} is a fractal sequence if it contains {{itself as a}} proper subsequence. (The self-containment property resembles that of visual fractals) A doubly fractal sequence of integers is defined by operations called <b>upper</b> <b>trimming</b> and lower trimming. C. Kimberling proved that signature sequences are doubly fractal and conjectured the converse. This article gives a procedure for constructing doubly fractal sequences and proves Kimberling's conjecture...|$|R

40|$|Data from gene {{expression}} arrays {{are influenced by}} many experimental parameters that lead to variations not simply accessible by standard quantification methods. To compare measurements from {{gene expression}} array experiments, quantitative data are commonly normalised using reference genes or global normalisation methods based on mean or median values. These methods {{are based on the}} assumption that (i) selected reference genes are expressed at a standard level in all experiments or (ii) that mean or median signal of expression will give a quantitative reference for each individual experiment. We introduce here a new ranking diagram, with which we can show how the different normalisation methods compare, and how they are influenced by variations in measurements (noise) that occur in every experiment. Furthermore, we show that an <b>upper</b> <b>trimmed</b> mean provides a simple and robust method for normalisation of larger sets of experiments by comparative analysis...|$|R

In-dash satellite navigation was offered on Japan-spec vehicles on <b>upper</b> <b>trim</b> level sedans and wagons starting with Model Year 1998, and continued to offer a Momo black leather steering wheel, gearshift knob and parking brake handle.|$|E
5000|$|After 1963, the Monterey was {{not sold}} in Canada, but was supplanted by the resurrected Meteor. Meteor {{competed in the}} low-priced field, but its <b>upper</b> <b>trim</b> series (Montcalm and LeMoyne) were {{typically}} {{very similar to the}} U.S. Monterey both in styling and appointments. Meteor continued as a separate marque through 1976 (1975-76 models continued the 1974 Monterey's front end styling) after which the name was applied to a base trim version of the Marquis, as the [...] "Mercury Marquis Meteor" [...] through 1981.|$|E

40|$|An FE {{model to}} {{simulate}} a multi stage deep drawing/redrawing process of a miniature tube with a flange mid-way its length was developed. At {{the final stage}} of the manufacturing sequence the <b>upper</b> <b>trimmed</b> end of the tube was curled. The curling operation progressed to a point until the curling force caused the collapse of the flange. The objective of the research was to define the limiting geometric and process parameters for the curling operation. Two alternative FE models, 3 D and 2 D axisymmetric, were adopted. The 3 D model was used to investigate anisotropic behaviour of the material during the first drawing operation in order to establish whether there were conditions that warranted resorting to 3 D modelling. Eventually the 2 D axisymmetric model was used to simulate the material flow in all 11 forming operations. Additionally a springback analysis was performed after each operation; strain and stress states resulting from the unloading of the formed component were used as the initial states for the succeeding operations. The FE simulation results matched the experimental results and led {{to the conclusion that the}} accuracy of trimming played a critical role in the outcome of the curling operation...|$|R
2500|$|The Series 80, which {{belonged to}} an <b>upper</b> {{category}} <b>trim</b> package, had a [...] straight eight engine developing 104 hp {{of power to}} 2,800 rpm.

50|$|Signature (1981-2011)The Signature Series was the mid-level, {{and also}} most popular, trim level from 1980 through 2003. In 2004 the trim levels were renamed, and the Signature Series was now used to {{describe}} the base trim level and Ultimate was now {{used to describe}} the <b>upper</b> level <b>trim.</b> In 2005 the Ultimate was dropped and all trim levels were changed to a version of Signature. The base trim level for 2005 was called Signature, the mid trim level was called Signature Limited and the top-of-line trim-level was called Signature L. The trim level designations were revised again for the 2006 model year with a Designer Series being added between the Signature Limited and top-of-line Signature L.

50|$|Soft touch {{materials}} were {{used throughout the}} passenger cabin, such as the dashboard, doors (arm rests), steering wheel, and shift levers.

Custom Vinyl vinyl or soft Custom Cloth cloth and velour seating surfaces were used along with fabric headliners, door inserts, and plush carpeting, depending on the <b>trim</b> level. <b>Upper</b> class <b>trim</b> levels also used acoustic deadening materials for quieter ride comfort. From model years 1973 to 1977, chestnut wood grain inserts were used on the dashboard and doors for further visual enhancement. The wood grain inserts were replaced by bright brushed aluminium inserts for model years 1978 to 1987. A Delco AM/FM audio sound system and an all-season climate control system that heated, cooled, cleaned, and dehumidified were optional extras.|$|R
