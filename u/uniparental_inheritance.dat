This suggests that maternal mitochondrial inheritance following hyphal fusions is due to some mechanism other than those that implicate the trichogyne. Following hyphal fusion, mututally exclusive nuclear migration permitted investigation of reciprocal interactions. Regardless of which strain accepted nuclei following seven replicate hyphal fusion matings, acceptor mtDNA was the only type detected in 34 hyphal plug and tip samples taken from the contact and acceptor zones.

50|$|<b>Uniparental</b> <b>{{inheritance}}</b> is a non-mendelian form of inheritance {{that consists}} of the transmission of genotypes from one parental type to all progeny. That is, all the genes in offspring will originate from only the mother or only the father. This phenomenon is most commonly observed in eukaryotic organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplasts. This is because such organelles contain their own DNA and are capable of independent mitotic replication that does not endure crossing over with the DNA from another parental type. Although <b>uniparental</b> <b>inheritance</b> {{is the most common}} form of inheritance in organelles, there is increased evidence of diversity. Some studies found doubly <b>uniparental</b> <b>inheritance</b> (DUI) and biparental transmission to exist in cells.

40|$|Introduction: MtDNA {{analysis}} is relevant for forensic identity testing {{as well for}} human evolution studies.

Results: Preliminary results show that most maternal relatives share identical mtDNA sequences, and neomutation rate seems to be very low from one generation to another.

40|$|Mutations causing {{mitochondrial}} defects were induced in a {{virulent strain}} of the chestnut blight fungus Cryphonectria parasitica (Murr.) Barr. Virulence on apples and chestnut trees was reduced in four of six extensively characterized mutants. Relative to the virulent progenitor, the attenuated mutants had reduced growth rates, abnormal colony morphologies, and few asexual spores, and they resembled virus-infected strains. The respiratory defects and attenuated virulence phenotypes (hypovirulence) were transmitted from two mutants to a virulent strain by hyphal contact. The infectious transmission of hypovirulence occurred independently of the transfer of nuclei, did not involve a virus, and dynamically reflects fungal diseases caused by mitochondrial mutations. In these mutants, mitochondrial mutations are further implicated in generation of the attenuated state by (i) <b>uniparental</b> (maternal) <b>inheritance</b> of the trait, (ii) presence of high levels of cyanide-insensitive mitochondrial alternative oxidase activity, (iii) cytochrome deficiencies, and (iv) structural abnormalities in the mtDNA.

40|$|Current {{analysis}} {{shows that the}} last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) was capable of full meiotic sex. The original eukaryotic life cycle can probably be described as clonal, interrupted by episodic sex triggered by external or internal stressors. The cycle could have started in a highly flexible form, with the interruption of either diploid or haploid clonal growth determined by stress signals only. Eukaryotic sex most likely evolved {{in response to a}} high mutation rate, arising from the uptake of the endosymbiont, as this (proto) mitochondrion generated internal reactive oxygen species. This is consistent with the likely development of full meiotic sex from a diverse set of existing archaeal (the host of the endosymbiont) repair and signalling mechanisms. Meiotic sex could thus {{have been one of the}} fruits of symbiogenesis at the basis of eukaryotic origins: a product of the merger by which eukaryotic cells arose.

50|$|<b>Uniparental</b> <b>inheritance</b> {{occurs in}} extranuclear genes when only one parent {{contributes}} organellar DNA to the offspring. A {{classic example of}} uniparental gene transmission is the maternal inheritance of human mitochondria. The mother's mitochondria are transmitted to the offspring at fertilization via the egg. The father's mitochondrial genes are not transmitted to the offspring via the sperm. Very rare cases which require further investigation have been reported of paternal mitochondrial inheritance in humans, in which the father's mitochondrial genome is found in offspring. Chloroplast genes can also inherit uniparentally during sexual reproduction. They are historically thought to inherit maternally, but paternal inheritance in many species is increasingly being identified.

Here we address this question by conducting outgroup crosses between distantly related C. gattii lineages (VGII and VGIII) and ingroup crosses between isolates from the same molecular type (VGII).

Visceral leishmaniasis is endemic in Ethiopia where {{it has also been}} responsible for fatal epidemics. It is postulated that genetic exchange in Leishmania has implications for heterosis (hybrid vigour), spread of virulent strains, resistance to chemotherapeutics, and exploitation of different hosts and vectors. Here we analyse 11 natural Ethiopian Leishmania donovani isolates consisting of four putative hybrids, seven parent-like isolates and over 90 derived biological clones. We apply a novel combination of high resolution multilocus microsatellite typing (five loci) and multilocus sequence typing (four loci) that together distinguish parent-like and hybrid L. donovani strains. Results indicate that the four isolates (and their associated biological clones) are genetic hybrids, not the results of mixed infections, each possessing heterozygous markers consistent with inheritance of divergent alleles from genetically distinct Ethiopian L. donovani lineages. The allelic profiles of the putative hybrids may have arisen from a single hybridisation event followed by inbreeding or gene conversion, or alternatively from two or more hybridisation events. Mitochondrial sequencing showed <b>uniparental</b> maxicircle <b>inheritance</b> for all of the hybrids, each possessing a single mitochondrial genotype.

The soon-to-be [...] "father of modern genetics" [...] spent his days conducting hybridization experiments on pea plants(Pisum sativum) in his monastery's garden. During a period of seven years (1856 to 1863), Mendel cultivated and tested some 29,000 pea plants which led to him deducing the two famous generalizations known as Mendel's Laws of Heredity. The first, the law of segregation, states that [...] "when any individual produces gametes, the copies of a gene separate, so that each gamete receives only one copy". The second, the law of independent assortment, states that [...] "alleles of different genes assort independently of one another during gamete formation". Although his work was published, it lay dormant until it was rediscovered in 1900 by Hugo de Vries and Carl Correns {{but it was not until}} 1909 that non-mendelian inheritance was even suggested. Carl Erich Correns and Erwin Baur, in separately conducted researches on Pelargonium and Mirabilis plants, observed a green-white variation (later found as the result of mutations in the chloroplast genome) that did not follow the Mendelian laws of inheritance. Nearly twenty years later, non-mendelian inheritance of a mitochondrial mutation was also observed and, in the sixties, it was proven that chloroplasts and mitochondria have their own DNA and that they are capable translation, transcription, and replication independent of the nucleus.

However, since first proposed by Boveri [Sitzungsber. Ges. Morph. Phys.

This <b>uniparental</b> (paternal) <b>inheritance</b> of centrosomes is logically based on the premise that the maternal (egg) centrosome is lost before the onset of the first mitosis. For the processes of the selective loss of the maternal centrosome, three models have been proposed: One stresses the intrinsic factors within the centrosome itself; the other two emphasize external factors such as cytoplasmic conditions or the sperm centrosome. In the present study, we have examined the validity of one of the models in which the sperm centrosome overwhelms the maternal centrosomes. Because centrosomes cast off into both the first and the second polar bodies (PB) are known to retain the capacity for reproduction and cell-division pole formation, we observed the behavior of those PB centrosomes with reproductive capacity and the sperm centrosome in the same zygotic cytoplasm. We prepared two kinds of fertilized eggs that contain reproductive maternal centrosomes, (1) by micromanipulative transplantation of the PB centrosomes into fertilized eggs, and (2) by suppression of the PB extrusions of fertilized eggs with cytochalasin B. In both types of eggs, the PB centrosomes could double and form cell-division poles, indicating that they are not suppressed by the sperm centrosome, which in turn indicates that selective loss of the maternal centrosome is due to intrinsic factors within the centrosomes themselves...|$|R

Sgce is {{a component of the}} dystrophin-sarcoglycan complex, Zac 1 is a nuclear protein inducing growth arrest and/or apoptosis, and Zac 1 is a potential tumor suppressor gene. Sgce and Zac 1 are expressed predominantly from their paternal alleles in all adult mouse tissues, except that Zac 1 is biallelic in the liver and Sgce is weakly expressed from the maternal allele in the brain. Sgce and Zac 1 are broadly expressed in embryos, with Zac 1 being highly expressed in the liver primordium, the umbilical region, and the neural tube. Sgce, however, is strongly expressed in the allantoic region on day 9. 5 but becomes more widely expressed throughout the embryo by day 11. 5.
