5|$|When the town's ruffians vandalize the half-restored carousel, {{the captain}} redoubles his efforts. By {{this time he}} has found, to his displeasure, that Mike's {{favorite}} pastime is to officiate the weekly cock fights, and the two have a falling-out. Mike refuses {{to make good on}} a promise of a much needed part for the carousel, unless the soldier agrees to fight a dog. The veteran reluctantly agrees to the fight during which he kills the dog. After installing the last piece that completes the carousel's restoration, he lays the dog's body inside it, starts it <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> away, while the townspeople look on.|$|E
5|$|Crazy and Roz {{are then}} seen at a pier. Rozzie {{tells him that}} Vinnie is {{ditching}} town, her and the rumble, which makes Crazy {{the leader of the}} Stompers. Disgusted with Vinnie's cowardice, Roz allows Crazy to make love to her in an abandoned warehouse. Solly interrupts, and fights Crazy to get him to talk. As he is losing, Crazy lies, saying Vinnie killed the gang members. Vinnie packs up his things and leaves, but bumps into the Stompers and in time for the rumble. As the two gangs wait for Boogaloo to show up, Solly drives up, ready to arrest Vinnie. On the rooftop of a nearby building, Crazy begins shooting randomly towards the street, causing both gangs to begin shooting at each other. Vinnie tries to run and is shot at by Solly. Crazy jumps off the rooftop, landing on Solly, killing himself and Solly. As Roz calls up a radio station to make a memorial request in honor of Vinnie, he stands <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> away, leaving Brooklyn.|$|E
5|$|In Chicago, {{a man by}} {{the name}} of Henry Weems wins $100,000 playing poker against a mobster named Joe Cutrona, though Weems appears ignorant of the basic rules of poker. Suspecting that Weems cheated, Cutrona {{attempts}} to kill him by throwing him off the 29th story of the building they are in. After Weems lands in an access hatch to a basement, he stands right back <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> away, completely uninjured. Two agents in a car stationed outside witness the event and eventually tell Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who promptly take the case. Mulder initially believes the man has the ability to cure himself, but Scully thinks he may just be very lucky by landing in a pile of laundry that was right under the access hatch.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} chronicles two {{alternative}} time frames, {{with the first}} of Carey in the present, tearful and remorseful their separation, while the other of several different past memories in which she shared with her lover. The video begins with Carey wearing a long brown blouse, laying on a sofa in an elegantly furnished home. As the song begins, she stands <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> around the living room, while remembering and lamenting her failed relationship. As the first memory of Carey and her lover together on a soccer field is shown, she is once again shown in the present, however clothed in a large white sweater while tears trickle down her cheek. As the memory continues of that night on the soccer field, they are seen together, caressing each other and holding {{each other in a}} tight embrace. Carey, in the present, makes her way into a heated pool, where she lays her leg on the deck, re-enacting a famed scene from Marilyn Monroe's unreleased film, Something's Got to Give (1962). The next memory is of the pair together in the same pool, however in happier times. During the song's bridge, the scenes alternate from Carey at her home in the present, to the duo holding each other intimately in a car. The video ends with Carey alone in the car, while wearing her lover's jacket.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Usher {{entering}} a club, {{and in another}} scene dancing in front of blue lasers; the video alternates between both the club and laser scenes throughout. In the former setting, Usher is sat down when a woman—portrayed by Destiny, video producer Mr. X's friend—approaches him and attempts to seduce him. The woman stands <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> to the dance-floor, telling Usher to [...] "come get me" [...] and [...] "baby let's go", {{in sync with the}} song. Usher goes and dances with her during the chorus. In the beginning of the second verse, the laser scene with Usher dancing now shows both blue and green lasers. Usher and the woman are still dancing, with the woman further attempting to seduce him.|$|E
500|$|The video {{opens in}} an {{industrial}} warehouse, and shows Derulo reclining on a couch while his friends are passed out beside, around {{and on top of}} him. As he sings a portion of the song's chorus, Derulo reminisces about the previous night. The scene then shifts to Thornton, who is still awake standing {{on the other side of}} the warehouse surrounded by smoke. Derulo then stands <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> towards her while performing solo dance moves. During the chorus, the two begin to do sexual dance routines together and eventually everyone wakes up. Derulo can then be seen doing various choreographed routines with male and female back-up dancers, as the crowd surrounding them hold up flashlights. In the final scene, a fire sprinkler in the warehouse goes off, and Derulo and his female dancers continue dancing. Towards the end of the video, the crowd ends up dancing with each other, while Derulo dances with a female. A writer for MTV News commented that the video could have easily starred Kesha, Jennifer Lopez or Britney Spears, and described it as being [...] "glossy and fun, a complete reflection of the tune's party-anthem vibe." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler, who had previously directed Rihanna videos for [...] "Hate That I Love You" [...] and [...] "Shut Up and Drive". The video was shot in Venice, Los Angeles on April 3, 2008. The video begins with Rihanna {{standing in front of}} a black backdrop for the opening of the song. As the first verse starts, the scene is intercut with another of Rihanna looking out the window at her boyfriend and standing behind the front door as he approaches and asks to come in. As Rihanna walks way from the door singing the lyrics [...] "Don't tell me you're sorry cos you're not", the viewer realizes that her boyfriend has perhaps done something wrong and been unfaithful. During the first chorus and second verse, Rihanna is shown in a different outfit, this time sitting in a silver Porsche in a garage. As Rihanna pulls out of the garage and onto the street, her ex-boyfriend walks alongside the car as she drives and begs her to forgive him; she pulls away. For the bridge, Rihanna is shown sitting on a bed as well as in front of the black backdrops as she reads a text message from her ex-boyfriend, who asks to meet her. During the last chorus, Rihanna appears in a different outfit and walks into a lounge, where she puts some clothes on a table and then sits on a sofa. As her ex-boyfriend walks in, the singer gets <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> over to the clothes, where she withdraws some matches and strikes one, dropping it on what is made aware to be some of her ex-boyfriend's clothes. As the song comes to and end, Rihanna walks out of the room whilst he tries to put out the fire.|$|E
2500|$|The fifth season {{episode of}} [...] titled The Modern Prometheus has Mary Shelley draw her {{inspiration}} from two immortals battling {{during the long}} winter in the Swiss Alps. Upon seeing Byron (in the series secretly an Immortal) restored to life by lightning, she asks Methos why her child rots in her grave while Byron simply gets <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> away. Methos admonishes her to pity their kind, for life can go on when it should not. The isolation he describes enables Shelley to write her classic.|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Emil Nava and was premiered on 30 January 2011. The video begins closing up on a giant teddy bear that is missing an eye and an arm, accompanied by a musical box-rendering of Johann Strauss II's The Blue Danube, before zooming out to show a child version of Jessie J sitting next to it, who then gets <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> around the bear, turning her into her full-sized self. Jessie J is then shown standing and holding out her hands, and as the lyrics suggest, a coconut man and a moonhead appear on her outstretched hands (this is {{a reference to the}} two individuals who co-wrote the song with her: Dr. Luke is coconut man and Kelly is moonhead in reference to his large head) and pointing to herself (referring to herself as pea because of her small head). The video then goes back to Jessie J in the lap of the large teddy bear and shows various scenes of Jessie J holding up items that relate to the lyrics, including a huge price tag and pointing to left and the right. As the chorus begins, Jessie J is shown dancing under a money tree with dollar bills covering its branches. A scene of Jessie J is then shown of her as an oversized ballerina in a jewelry box. As Jessie J says the words [...] "video hoes", a scene of her wearing the same outfit as in her [...] "Do It Like a Dude" [...] video and dancing holding her crotch, suggesting that she does not approve of video hoes. Jessie J is next shown riding around on a small tricycle. As the song progresses into the second chorus, Jessie J and two background dancers are shown as marionettes, with Jessie J wearing a Pinocchio hat, dancing to the song. The video then moves to B.o.B as his verse begins, showing him dancing in front of a beat up car, that starts jumping and moving to the beat. He is then shown {{standing in the middle of}} four large, toy green army men. As his verse ends, Jessie J is shown squeezed into a doll house and holding a glass doll that is missing part of its head. As the video goes into its final chorus, scenes of Jessie J are shown her dancing with B.o.B, laying on the floor missing a leg, sitting in an oversized chair, dressed up as a doll in a blue and white dress, and dancing with her younger self. The video ends with Jessie J closing the door to her doll house; with her still inside it, the camera carries on zooming out.|$|E

60|$|Hades {{is not an}} {{unpleasant}} place. Most of the people look rather cheerful. You don't see any frantic gamblers gnashing their teeth or dashing down their last stakes. The winners have the most anxious faces; or the poor shabby fellows who have got systems, and are pricking down the alternations of red and black on cards, and don't seem to be playing at all. On fete days the country people come in, men and women, to gamble; and THEY seem to be excited as they put down their hard-earned florins with trembling rough hands, and watch {{the turn of the}} wheel. But what you call the good company is very quiet and easy. A man loses his mass of gold, and gets <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> off, without any particular mark of despair. The only gentleman whom I saw at Noirbourg who seemed really affected was a certain Count de Mustacheff, a Russian of enormous wealth, who clenched his fists, beat his breast, cursed his stars, and absolutely cried with grief: not for losing money, but for neglecting to win and play upon a coup de vingt, a series in which the red was turned up twenty times running: which series, had he but played, it is clear that he might have broken M. Lenoir's bank, and shut up the gambling-house, and doubled his own fortune--when he would have been no happier, and all the balls and music, all the newspaper-rooms and parks, all the feasting and pleasure of this delightful Rougetnoirbourg would have been at an end.|$|E
