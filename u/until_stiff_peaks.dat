5000|$|The common {{ingredients}} for early recipes are cream, rosewater and sugar, whipped <b>until</b> <b>stiff.</b> Other flavouring agents, e.g., cloves or ginger, are also known from various recipes. It {{is the process}} of whipping cream <b>until</b> <b>stiff</b> that is often likened to snow {{as can be seen in}} passages such as [...] "Beat your cream with a stick until the Snow rises ...". It was often draped over another item to give the appearance of snow having fallen over the item.|$|R

5000|$|Beat <b>Until</b> <b>Stiff</b> is {{the second}} release, and first {{full-length}} album, by Hullabaloo. It was released in 1989 on Toxic Shock. For Beat <b>Until</b> <b>Stiff,</b> TQ had taken over as full-time lead singer for the band (though Sluggo sings on the tune [...] "Taskmaster" [...] and hidden track [...] "Sea of Trash"), and his vocals that range from a growl to a scream begin to characterize the bands sound. The bands punk rock sensibilities {{are still in the}} forefront with fast, thrashy songs like [...] "The Lickyerbutt Song" [...] and [...] "This is My Rifle", and with subjects like [...] "Retardo Porn" [...] and [...] "Suicidal Maniac." [...] But with the songs [...] "Beat Until Stiff" [...] and [...] "Gotta Go" [...] some slower tempos and heavier guitars are introduced, giving the album a proto-grunge feel. The trademark trumpet and saxophone solos are still present throughout. Kris Fell, in the Boston Phoenix said that the [...] "lyrics on Beat <b>Until</b> <b>Stiff</b> are blunt, almost photographic representation of the grotesque..." [...] This album features a guitar solo by Mr. Horribly Charred Infant of the Happy Flowers.|$|R
5000|$|Heavy body {{acrylics}} {{are typically}} {{found in the}} Artist and Student Grade paints. [...] "Heavy Body" [...] refers to the viscosity or thickness of the paint. They are {{the best choice for}} impasto or heavier paint applications and will hold a brush or knife stroke and even a medium <b>stiff</b> <b>peak.</b> Gel Mediums ("pigment-less paints") are also available in various viscosities and used to thicken or thin paints, as well as extend paints and add transparency.|$|R
50|$|According to most recipes, the yolks must be whipped {{until they}} swell to double their {{original}} volume. Some recipes also call for egg whites (1--2 whites for each 10 yolks), beaten separately to <b>stiff</b> <b>peaks</b> consistency and gently mixed into the yolks. The mixture is then poured into greased muffin forms (about 1/2 tablespoon each) and baked {{until they are}} firm but still without crust. The pieces are then boiled lightly in the syrup, which may be flavored with rum, vanilla, or orange peel.|$|R

5000|$|Beat <b>Until</b> <b>Stiffs</b> {{new songs}} were {{recorded}} and mixed at the Fort Apache South studio by Paul Q. Kolderie. Kolderie also re-mixed the two previously released songs for this album. The cover art for the album lists the producers as [...] "Hugo & Luigi," [...] {{but this is}} yet another allusion to The Hullaballoos, who were [...] "packaged for U.S. consumption by Hugo Peretti and Luigi Creatore, notorious vice presidents and A&R directors of Roulette Records.".|$|R
50|$|Instead of the {{traditional}} cake ingredient butter or paste (such as shortening), vegetable oil is used; but this is difficult to beat enough air into. Therefore, chiffon cakes, like angel cakes and other foam cakes, achieve a fluffy texture by having egg whites beaten <b>until</b> <b>stiff</b> and folded them into the cake batter before baking. Its aeration properties rely on both {{the quality of the}} meringue and the chemical leaveners. Its oil-based batter is initially blended before folding into the meringue.|$|R
50|$|In 1989 Hullabaloo {{was signed}} to the Toxic Shock out of Tucson, Arizona, which {{featured}} albums by such far-flung bands as Hickoids and Skin Yard They released their full-length Album, Beat <b>Until</b> <b>Stiff,</b> and toured the United States, performing with labelmates Hickoids, Jesus Chrysler, and House of Large Sizes at various dates. Other notable shows included Cows in Minneapolis, The Hell Cows in Seattle and The Mudwimmin in San Francisco. The Seattle show brought Hullabaloo {{to the attention}} of the burgeoning Seattle music scene, where they met Daniel House of C/Z Records and Nirvana.|$|R
5000|$|Chemical {{leavening}} agents {{include a}} weak base, such as baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) plus a weak acid, such as cream of tartar, lemon juice, or cultured buttermilk, {{to create an}} acid—base reaction that releases carbon dioxide. (Quick bread leavened specifically with baking soda is often called [...] "soda bread"). Baking powder contains both an acid and a base in dry powdered form, and simply needs a liquid medium in which to react. Other alternative leavening agents are egg whites mechanically beaten to form <b>stiff</b> <b>peaks,</b> {{as in the case}} of many waffle recipes, or steam, in the case of cream puffs. Nevertheless, in a commercial process, designated chemical leavening acids and bases are used to make gas production consistent and controlled. Examples of acid—base combinations include: ...|$|R

Emulsion-templating, i. e. leaching a hardened ``mayonnaise'' for removing the oil followed by pyrolysis led to carbon polyHIPEs (polymerised High Internal Phase Emulsions). The second kind of materials, obtained by whipping the emulsions, presented hierarchical porous structures made of cells whose walls had a polyHIPE texture. The third kind, obtained by whipping <b>until</b> <b>stiff</b> oil-free tannin solutions, was carbon ``meringues'' whose cell sizes were controlled by tannin concentration...|$|R
5000|$|The five {{original}} {{songs on}} the EP show that the transition started with Beat <b>Until</b> <b>Stiff</b> had completed, as band's sound had moved away from punk, more fully into the territory of grunge. The extra guitar makes for a much heavier sound, and the tempos are slower and songs longer that on previous releases. Nonetheless, the band continued to experiment with unusual song forms and odd meters. And the unusual instrumentation comes to the forefront: the song [...] "Die Laughing" [...] begins with a prominent, blaring trumpet solo, and [...] "Curse of Civilization" [...] features TQ on an extended sax solo as well.|$|R
50|$|Dead Serious is {{the third}} release, and second EP by Hullabaloo. It was {{recorded}} in 1990 by Paul Kolderie at the Fort Apache Studios in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It was released by Toxic Shock in the United States and Musical Tragedies in Europe. The band's lineup had changed significantly since their previous release, Beat <b>Until</b> <b>Stiff.</b> Their previous bass player (Pete Foley) had left the band. He was replaced on bass by former drummer John Quinn, who was in turn replaced on drums by Chris Rossow. In addition, the band added a second guitar player, Kevin James, formerly of noise-rock instrumental band The Loving Six. James also produced the recording.|$|R
50|$|The lemon custard {{is usually}} {{prepared}} with egg yolks, lemon zest and juice, sugar, and, optionally, starch. This {{gives it a}} texture {{similar to that of}} a sturdy pudding. The meringue, which includes well beaten egg whites and sugar, is cooked on top of the pie filling. As the meringue bakes, air bubbles trapped inside the protein of the egg white will expand and swell. However, if the egg whites are beaten too much, or if a tiny amount of fat is allowed to contaminate the mixture, then the proteins {{will not be able to}} form the correct molecular structure when cooked, and the meringue may collapse when cooked. The meringue can be beaten into either soft or <b>stiff</b> <b>peaks.</b> The temperature the pie is baked at and the method by which sugar is added also determines the texture and durability of the meringue.|$|R
40|$|Egg white foam {{is a type}} of foam (a colloid {{in which}} a gas is {{dispersed}} or spread throughout a liquid) used in meringues, souffl és, and angel food cake to make them light and porous (airy). To prepare an egg white foam, egg whites are initially beaten (with a wire wisk or electric mixer) until they become frothy. Then an acid (such as cream of tartar) is added. Depending on the application, the beating of the egg white continues until soft (when the peaks stand straight and bend slightly at the tips) or <b>stiff</b> <b>peaks</b> (when the peaks stand straight without bending) are formed. Salt and sugar may also be added. How It Works: Egg whites are made up of water, protein, and small amounts of minerals and sugars. When the egg whites are beaten, air is added and the egg white protein, albumen, is denatured. Denaturation is the change of a protein’s shape under stress (in this case, beating). The denatured protein coats the air bubbles and holds in the water, causing them t...|$|R
40|$|International audienceNew macro-cellular carbons, called carbon meringues, {{have been}} {{prepared}} by whipping <b>until</b> <b>stiff</b> an aqueous solution of tannin until liquid foam was obtained, which was next stabilized in an oven and pyrolysed, hence their name. With such cheap, fast and very easy process, flawless, homogeneous carbon foams were obtained in {{a wider range of}} density than that of more conventional cellular vitreous carbon (CVC) foams derived from similar formulations but made by physical foaming. The porosity, the average cell size and the cell wall thickness were only controlled by the initial concentration of tannin, all other things being equal. The resultant carbon meringues were fully investigated by electron microscopy, X-ray tomography, mercury porosimetry, Kr and N- 2 adsorption, thermal conductivity and mechanical compression studies. Differences with former CVC foams, and advantages of the new process and materials have been emphasised...|$|R

Pre-blended premix of fish oil and corn oil was then added slowly while mixing of the ingredients continued for another 30  min. Afterward, ZnSO 4 · 5 H 2 O was dissolved in double distilled water and mixed well with the other ingredients to form wet dough. The corresponsive of ZnSO 4 · 5 H 2 O corresponding to each diet was dissolved in double distilled water and mixed well with the other diet ingredients <b>until</b> <b>stiff</b> dough resulted. The dough was then passed through a pelletizer having a die of 2  mm diameter and dried at 30  °C in drier for 24  h (Hidalgo et al. 2002). The pellets were then packed, sealed, and stored at − 20  °C until used.|$|R

50|$|New Boots and Panties!! is {{the debut}} album by Ian Dury, {{released}} in the UK on Stiff Records on 30 September 1977. Usually {{thought of as the}} first album by Ian Dury and the Blockheads (his backing band from 1977 to 1982), the album is credited solely to Dury as the Blockheads were not officially formed <b>until</b> <b>Stiff's</b> 'Live Stiffs' package tour the month after its release, and two members of the Blockheads do not play on the album. Although it is often cited {{as one of the first}} classic UK punk albums, the record covers a diverse range of musical styles reflecting Dury's influences and background in pub rock, taking in funk, disco, British music hall and early rock and roll, courtesy of Dury's musical hero Gene Vincent. Dury's lyrics also eschew the anti-establishment stance associated with punk music, preferring cheeky love songs or character stories based on the working-class people of the East End and Essex Estuary areas where he grew up. The songs are frequently ribald and profane, but also contain humour and affection for his characters.|$|R
50|$|For Other Ranks, the SD uniform {{originally}} comprised khaki wool (serge) trousers, a khaki wool tunic, with stand-and-fall (or Prussian) collar, four pockets on the front, each buttoned {{closed by}} a flap {{with a straight}} (horizontal) edge, large, serge reinforcement patches over each shoulder, shoulder straps {{and a pair of}} brass wire hangers on the back, over the kidneys, to support the belt. The front of the jacket was closed by five buttons, usually of a regimental pattern, arranged vertically. A peaked cap was provided, covered in the same khaki serge (including the <b>stiff</b> <b>peak),</b> with a leather chin strap (brown, for most regiments) held at either side by brass or horn buttons. This uniform was worn with ankle Ammunition boots; in the field, Puttees would be wound up (or down) the length of the shins, covering the top of the boots. The carrying equipment worn by infantry with this uniform was normally the 1908 Pattern Webbing, made of fabric and also khaki (though a lighter shade than the uniform). Cavalry and gunners of the Royal Regiment of Artillery did not wear webbing equipment, but instead used the leather 1903_Bandolier Equipment, worn over one shoulder. Originally derived from the bandoliers carried by the Boer commandos during the Second Boer War, it had been found to be unsuitable for infantry use but remained in service with mounted troops.|$|R

5000|$|The drink {{crossed the}} Atlantic to the British colonies during the 18th century. Since brandy and wine were heavily taxed, rum from the Triangular Trade with the Caribbean was a {{cost-effective}} substitute. The inexpensive liquor, coupled with plentiful farm {{and dairy products}} available to colonists, helped the drink become very popular in America. When the supply of rum to the newly founded United States was reduced {{as a consequence of}} the American Revolutionary War, Americans turned to domestic whiskey, and eventually bourbon in particular, as a substitute. In places in the American colonies where even bourbon was too expensive, homemade moonshine spirits were added to eggnog. Eggnog [...] "became tied to the holidays" [...] when it was adopted in the United States in the 1700s. Eggnog [...] "...seems to have been popular on both sides of the Atlantic" [...] in the 18th century. Records show that the first US President, George Washington, [...] "...served an eggnog-like drink to visitors" [...] which included [...] "...rye whiskey, rum, and sherry." [...] The President's recipe called for a variety of alcoholic beverages along with the dairy and egg ingredients: [...] "One quart cream, one quart milk, one dozen tablespoons sugar, one pint brandy, 1/2 pint rye whiskey, 1/2 pint Jamaica rum, and 1/4 pint sherry." [...] The recipe instructs cooks to [...] "mix the liquor first, then separate yolks and whites of eggs, add sugar to beaten yolks, mix well. Add milk and cream, slowly beating. Beat whites of eggs <b>until</b> <b>stiff</b> and fold slowly into mixture. Let set in cool place for several days. Taste frequently." ...|$|R
