5|$|Keynes's {{prescription}} for strong public investment had ties to {{his interest in}} uncertainty. Keynes had given a <b>unique</b> <b>perspective</b> on statistical inference in A Treatise on Probability, written in 1921, years before his major economic works. Keynes thought strong public investment and fiscal policy would counter the negative impacts the uncertainty of economic fluctuations can have on the economy. While Keynes's successors {{paid little attention to}} the probabilistic parts of his work, uncertainty may have played a central part in the investment and liquidity-preference aspects of General Theory.|$|E

These Crew Earth Observations, are intended to record dynamic events on the Earth's surface such as storms, fires, or volcanoes. For example, a photo from 1 January 2001 shows Mount Cleveland, Alaska, with a plume of smoke, prior to its eruption the following month.

25|$|Individualized {{learning}} was also integral to {{his theory of}} child education. He argued that the student combines information he already knows with what is learned, and forms a <b>unique</b> <b>perspective</b> on the newly learned information. Montaigne also thought that tutors should encourage a student’s natural curiosity {{and allow them to}} question things.He postulated that successful students were those who were encouraged to question new information and study it for themselves, rather than simply accepting what they had heard from the authorities on any given topic. Montaigne believed that a child’s curiosity could serve as an important teaching tool when the child is allowed to explore the things that they are curious about.|$|E

25|$|Another {{theory of}} {{creative}} {{people is the}} investment theory of creativity. This approach {{suggest that there are}} many individual and environmental factors that must exist in precise ways for extremely high levels of creativity opposed to average levels of creativity. In the investment sense, a person with their particular characteristics in their particular environment may see an opportunity to devote their time and energy into something that has been overlooked by others. The creative person develops an undervalued or under-recognised idea {{to the point that it}} is established as a new and creative idea. Just like in the financial world, some investments are worth the buy in, while others are less productive and do not build to the extent that the investor expected. This investment theory of creativity views creativity in a <b>unique</b> <b>perspective</b> compared to others, by asserting that creativity might rely to some extent on the right investment of effort being added to a field at the right time in the right way.|$|E
