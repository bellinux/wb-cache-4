5000|$|The state {{government}} unified the loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>charges</b> {{in the state}} after reviewing and revising the prevailing charges. A scheme was launched allowing the advance remittance of loading/unloading charges through State Bank of Travancore branches. This fare would be claimed by the workers from the bank through [...] "Headload Workers Welfare Fund Board" [...] offices.|$|R
50|$|In year 2013, the ED had {{registered}} {{money laundering}} {{case in the}} NSEL scam under the provisions of PMLA, 2002 {{on the basis of}} FIR registered by EOW. The PMLA investigations revealed that NSEL was acting as a platform for these defaulters and NSEL was earning in the process of charging various fees, charges and penalties like application processing fees, annual subscription fees, delivery fees warehouse receipt transfer charges, procurement commission, penalties on shortages penalty for trade cancellation, loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>charges,</b> penalty on ucc code, penalty on withheld demat units, recurring charges etc.|$|R
5000|$|High-speed pulse lasts from 10 to 100 µs, {{the only}} time {{limitation}} is loading and <b>unloading</b> and capacitor <b>charge</b> time.|$|R
50|$|Following the incident, the Islamic Army in Iraq claimed {{responsibility}} for the explosion. According to the Ukrainian contingent commander in Iraq, Major General Serhiy Popko, there were reports of men sitting in a car and surveying the troops <b>unload</b> the <b>charges</b> before the blast, and then quickly speeding away afterwards. This caused speculation as to whether the IED was triggered remotely.|$|R
40|$|Historically, the {{scheduling}} {{of crude}} oil <b>unloading,</b> blending and <b>charging</b> in an oil refinery has been done manually by a scheduler. This is a very time consuming process and often the manual scheduler will not find the optimal schedule. Systematic optimization could dramatically {{improve the quality of}} the schedules...|$|R
50|$|Ashland entered Pearl Harbor on 13 April and {{underwent}} an availability. She took on amphibious craft late in May and got underway for the Philippines on 3 June. She touched at Samar on 1 July {{to embark}} PT boats and their crews for transportation to Kerama Retto. The ship sailed on 3 July, <b>unloaded</b> her <b>charges,</b> {{and returned to}} Leyte on 10 July. She shuttled a similar cargo to Okinawa soon thereafter and arrived at Eniwetok on 7 August to refuel. The war ended on 15 August while Ashland was steaming independently to Espiritu Santo. After mooring there on 17 August, she proceeded with a load of PT boats to Okinawa.|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} a three-year study to {{establish}} baseline estimates {{of the importance of}} wholesale produce markets (WPM) are reported. It is estimated that a third of all produce marketed in the United States and Canada goes through WPM. These facilities tend to be most important in larger urban areas. Gate and <b>unloading</b> fees commonly <b>charged</b> at WPM may place them at a competitive disadvantage relative to off-market sites. Agribusiness,...|$|R
5000|$|On 6 June 1944 LST-279 {{moved from}} Southampton to Portsmouth, where she loaded British troops and {{vehicles}} before joining a convoy for Normandy. On {{the morning of}} 7 June, the tank landing ship beached and <b>unloaded</b> her <b>charges</b> in the Green sector of Juno Beach. Casualties then came on board for the return trip to Portsmouth. On her next convoy run, however, the tank landing ship ran into trouble. German E-boats, operating from Cherbourg, torpedoed the ocean tug [...] and closed the LST convoy. Before nearby escorts drove off the attackers, one E-boat torpedo narrowly missed LST-279, passing 20 feet from her bow, but went on to damage [...] instead. Over the next two months, LST-279 made over a dozen more shuttle trips, carrying troops, ammunition, and supplies from England to the beachheads in France.|$|R
50|$|As {{the summer}} progressed, British submariners had noticed how {{vulnerable}} Italian coastal railway networks were. On 15 August 1941 Wanklyn and Upholder sailed to the Marittimo {{area with the}} hope of landing saboteurs—or train wrecking parties—along the coast to plant explosives along coastal railways. British submarines were now carrying out these operations regularly. Over the closing months of 1941, 12 such operations were carried out. On one occasion a submarine surfaced and shot up a locomotive with its deck gun. Once in the area, Wanklyn was directed onto two convoys and missed them both. On 20 August he moved to the Cape of St Vito. After breakfast he sighted a small cargo vessel and a trawler. Wanklyn ordered two torpedoes fired, one of which hit. The vessel—Enotria—staggered under the blow and sank. The trawler hastily <b>unloaded</b> depth <b>charges</b> and retreated to the west in the direction of Trapani. Wanklyn followed and observed the port under air attack.|$|R
40|$|The {{vision of}} self driving cars {{has existed for}} a long time and the field of {{autonomous}} vehicles has been of great interest to researchers and companies. Volvo construction equipment presented their Electrical Site project in September 2016, with predictions of reducing carbon emission up to 95 % and total cost of ownership by 25 %. In the project, multiple autonomous haulers are intended to work in a fleet, loading, <b>unloading</b> and <b>charging</b> in a cyclic behavior. This masterthesis focus on the lateral control system of the automated hauler platform HX. The platform is modeled in an comprehensive simulation environment and three different control algorithms have been implemented and tested; An adaptive Proportional, Integral and Derivative (PID) controller, Stanley and the Proportional Integral + Proportional controller. The PID controller is tuned using the Nyquist stability criterion and the other two algorithms are tuned using a Genetic Algorithm. Results indicate that, to reach the optimal performance of the tested algorithms, manual tuning from experimental testing is required...|$|R
