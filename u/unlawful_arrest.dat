500|$|The English {{common law}} has long {{recognized}} {{the right of}} an individual to resist with reasonable force an attempt of a police officer to make an <b>unlawful</b> <b>arrest.</b> [...] This offered a complete defense if nonlethal force was used, and would reduce a murder charge to manslaughter if a death ensued. [...] In Hopkin Huggett's case, English officials illegally seized a man {{to serve in the}} King's army. [...] Huggett and others observed this and fought to free the man. [...] In the course of the fight one of the King's men, John Barry, was killed and Huggett was put on trial for murder. [...] The English court ruled that since the officer was making an <b>unlawful</b> <b>arrest,</b> the most that could be charged was manslaughter. [...] In 1709, in Queen v. Tooley, the English court again found that when resisting an <b>unlawful</b> <b>arrest,</b> the death of an individual would result in a manslaughter charge instead of a murder charge. [...] When the United States separated from England, the common law was adopted by the new American courts and the right to resist <b>unlawful</b> <b>arrest</b> was clearly recognized.|$|E

[...] The Supreme Court reversed his conviction, noting that a person had the right to resist an <b>unlawful</b> <b>arrest,</b> {{and in the case of}} a death, murder may be reduced to manslaughter. The Supreme Court held the arrest to be unlawful due, in part, to the lack of a valid warrant.|$|E
500|$|In April 1899 at Sioux Falls, Bad Elk {{was tried}} in the United States Circuit Court for the District of South Dakota for murder.

The Court stated: “Where the officer is killed {{in the course of the}} {{disorder}} which naturally accompanies an attempted arrest that is resisted, the law looks with very different eyes upon the transaction, when the officer had the right to make the arrest, from what it does if the officer had no right.

[...] Warner's explanations and reasoning {{appear to have been}} [...] "accepted without question by subsequent courts..." [...] In 1969, {{during the height of the}} Civil Rights Movement, Paul Chevigny of the New York branch of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) responded that an <b>unlawful</b> <b>arrest</b> was a trespass against the person and was not consistent with Warner's explanations.|$|E

Administering poison, either contrary to section 23 or 24 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861, is also an offence; as is false imprisonment [...] including <b>unlawful</b> <b>arrest,</b> kidnap and hostage situations.

500|$|Justice Rufus Wheeler Peckham {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} a unanimous court. [...] Peckham noted that the prosecution's case and the defendant's case varied in their presentation of the facts.

[...] An officer could arrest for a felony without a warrant, but to arrest for a misdemeanor, the crime had to have occurred in the officer's presence. They ruled that the captain also did not have the authority to order the arrest.
