25|$|The Nuremberg trials {{initiated}} a movement for the prompt {{establishment of a}} permanent international criminal court, eventually leading over fifty years later {{to the adoption of}} the Statute of the International Criminal Court. This movement was brought about because during the trials, there were conflicting court methods between the German court system and the U.S. court system. The crime of conspiracy was unheard of in the civil law systems of the Continent. Therefore, the German defense found it unfair to charge the defendants with conspiracy to commit crimes, while the judges from common-law countries were <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>doing</b> so.|$|E

He's {{worked with}} Candlebox before and sold millions of albums with them, so working with us, {{we were kind of}} like his lab rats, you know? He's never really done a metal band before but overall I think he did a pretty fantastic job. He got a real live quality out of us because we were always <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>doing</b> drums first and then the bass, and then the guitar and then the vocals at the very end. This time we recorded most of the songs live with the whole band and then after one song was done, Warrel would immediately sing on it [...] of saving all of [...] to the very end, which kind of saves his voice in the overall recording process. I guess the whole album was done in a very different atmosphere and aspect that sounds really good.|$|E

[...] "Pain or not, Joe Frazier of Beaufort, South Carolina, was going for gold." [...] Joe proclaimed. Joe would fight a 30-year-old German {{mechanic}} named Hans Huber, who failed to make it on the German Olympic wrestling team. By now Joe was used to fighting bigger guys, but he was not <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>doing</b> it with a damaged left hand. When the opening bell sounded on fight night, Joe came out and started swinging punches, he threw his right hand more than usual that night. Every so often he'd used his left hook, but nothing landed with the kind of impact he managed in previous bouts. Under Olympic rules, 5 judges judge a bout, and that night three voted for Joe.|$|E

2500|$|The alterations, though minor, were however {{to cast a}} {{long shadow}} in the {{development}} of the Church of England. One, the [...] "Ornaments Rubric", related to what clergy were to wear while conducting services. Instead of the banning of all vestments except the rochet for bishops and the surplice for parish clergy, it permitted [...] "such ornaments...as were in use...in the second year of K. Edward VI". This allowed substantial leeway for more traditionalist clergy to retain some of the vestments which they felt were appropriate to liturgical celebration (at least until the Queen gave further instructions under the Act of Uniformity of 1559). It was to be the basis of claims in the 19th century that vestments such as chasubles, albs and stoles were legal. At Holy Communion, the words from the 1549 book, [...] "the Body of our Lord Jesus Christ" [...] etc. were [...] combined with the words of Edward's second book, [...] "Take eat in remembrance" [...] "suggesting on the one hand a real presence to those who wished to find it and on the other, the communion as memorial only", i.e. an objective presence and subjective reception. The instruction to the congregation to kneel when receiving communion was retained; but the Black Rubric [...] )#29 in the Forty-Two Articles of Faith which were reduced to 39) which denied any [...] "real and essential presence" [...] of Christ's flesh and blood, was removed [...] to [...] "conciliate traditionalists" [...] and aligned with Queen's sensibilities, [...] The removal of the Black Rubric complements the dual words of administration of communion and permits an action, kneeling to receive, which people were <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>doing.</b> The Prayer Book [...] "...was a masterpiece of theological engineering," [...] (arv.. The doctrines in the Prayer and the Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion would set the tone of Anglicanism which would prefer to steer a Middle Way between Roman Catholicism and radical forms of Protestantism, and avoid being identified as a Confessional Church like Calvinists and Lutherans. The conservative nature of these changes underlines the fact that reformed principles were by no means universally popular– a fact that the Queen recognised: her revived Act of Supremacy, giving her the ambiguous title of Supreme Governor, passed without difficulty but the Act of Uniformity 1559, giving statutory force to the Prayer Book, passed through the House of Lords by only three votes. It made constitutional history in being imposed by the laity alone, as all the bishops, except those imprisoned by the Queen and unable to attend, voted against it [...] Convocation had made its position clear by affirming the traditional doctrine of the Eucharist, the authority of the Pope, and the reservation by divine law to clergy [...] "of handling and defining concerning the things belonging to faith, sacraments, and discipline ecclesiastical" [...]|$|E

60|$|I {{stood out}} against those two men {{for about a}} half an hour, and then I began to give in a little, and think {{that it might be}} nice to roll along on my own little wheels over their {{beautiful}} smooth roads, and stop and smell the hedges and pick flowers whenever I felt like it; and so it ended in my agreeing to do the Exmoor country on a tricycle while Mr. Poplington and Jone went on bicycles. As to getting the machines, Mr. Poplington said he would attend to that. There was people in London who hired them to excursionists, and {{all he had to do}} was to send an order and they would be on hand in a day or two; and so that matter was settled and he wrote to London. I thought Mr. Poplington was a little old for that sort of exercise, but I found he had been <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>doing</b> a great deal of cycling in the part of the country where he lives; and besides, he isn't as old as I thought he was, being not much over fifty.

These natives, sir, {{as long as they have}} a white man close at the back, will go on doing the right thing most surprisingly well--even if left quite to themselves. Only the white man must be of the sort to put starch into them, and the captain is just the one for that. Why, sir, he has drilled him so well that now he needs hardly speak at all. I have seen that little wrinkled ape made to take the ship out of Pangu Bay on a blowy morning and on all through the islands; take her out first-rate, sir, dodging under the old man's elbow, and in such quiet style that you could not have told for the life of you which of the two was doing the work up there.
