Octavian's wife hears this and tries to comfort him with the {{suggestion}} that they build an abbey and dedicate it to the Virgin Mary. In thanks the Virgin will provide them with a child, she is sure (Octavian became the Roman Emperor Augustus in 27 BC, nearly thirty years before the birth of Christ.

According to the Bible, the story of Mount Gerizim takes <b>us</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> story of the time when Moses ordered Joshua to take the Twelve Tribes of Israel to the mountains by Shechem and place half of the tribes, six in number, on the top of Mount Gerizim (Mount of the Blessing), and the other half in Mount Ebal (Mount of the Curse). The two mountains were used to symbolize the significance of the commandments and serve as a warning to whoever disobeyed them.|$|E
25|$|So there’s no real choice this year, {{but what}} the Occupy {{movement}} has done has taken <b>us</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> era when Martin Luther King was in the Sixties said ‘This is unacceptable!’ We cannot {{have a situation where}} everything is owned by the 1% {{in the same way that}} Martin Luther King said in the Riverside Church that we have a government that is the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today, we are exploiting the planet, and that is unacceptable. So the memory of Martin Luther King – it’s about dreams, but it’s also about the courage to draw a line right there and say ‘We cannot go on crossing this line. This is a moral line, this is a line concerning power and the world’. And there today America is on that line. And people know that what we got to – these years after Martin Luther King was murdered – is completely unacceptable, and it’s his example that will inspire us as we go forward into this year.|$|E

Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film {{a score of}} 4.5 out of 5, and said, [...] "Agneepath is an uncomplicated story of revenge, is hard-hitting yet entertaining, dwells on strong emotions and aggressive and forceful action, yet is dissimilar from the original. It is a fitting tribute to the masterwork." [...] Subhash K.Jha of IANS gave it 4 out of 5 stars, while commenting, [...] "Every component of the film falls into place, with a resounding thump. Agneepath is brilliant in its brutality. It's a riveting and hectic homage {{to the spirit of}} the cinema when revenge reigned supreme. And content was king. This new Agneepath takes <b>us</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> era when there was no computer or cellphones. And communication with the audience was immediate and electrifying."

[...] Deepa Gahlot of Sify said, [...] "Vivah is far less offensive and far more watchable." [...] Nikhat Kazmi from The Times of India called it a [...] "simple documentation of something as banal as an engagement to a vivah". Madhuparna Das of The Telegraph criticised Vivah for lacking plot, flat characters and mentioning that the story was [...] "rather weak and improbable." [...] BBC described Vivah as [...] "a didactic, worthy, and highly sanitised take on reality in keeping with the Rajshri tradition." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave only 1 out of 5 stars and condemned the screenplay, calling both Kapoor and Rao [...] "insipid and boring." [...] A review carried by Anupama Chopra mentioned, [...] "Sooraj Barjatya's fantasy world is carefully constructed, but his conviction infuses his films with an emotional heft."

500|$|James Delingpole of The Spectator {{noted that}} {{subsequent}} to Fourth Doctor Tom Baker's departure and prior to Eccleston actors who portrayed the Doctor {{had a tendency}} to play the role [...] "too camp, knowing, lovable or twee". He felt that the [...] "brusque, sarky and virile" [...] Ninth Doctor [...] "transports <b>us</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> golden era of Jon Pertwee when the series still had that edge of darkness." [...] Marena Manzoufas, head of ABC programming, commented after picking up the series that Eccleston [...] "has brought a new dynamic energy to the role" [...] and the show would appeal to both long time viewers and new fans. She cited the high viewing figures of Eccleston's debut episode—over 10 million—as proof that audiences were ready to welcome in a new era of the show. Looking back on David Tennant's era and forward to Matt Smith, The Heralds Edd McCracken comments that casting Tennant had been a risk after [...] "the show's reputation and ratings" [...] had been [...] "restored under Eccleston". However he notes that due to the brevity of the Ninth Doctor's era Tennant subsequently had time to make his character more established. Richard Henley Davis of The Economic Voice also notes that Tennant [...] "had big boots to fill after Christopher Eccleston's Doctor Who, which many believe to be the greatest incarnation of the lunatic time lord." [...] In a 2005 interview Tennant himself stated [...] "there's an awful lot to live up to" [...] after taking on the role from Eccleston, having admired his performances as a viewer.|$|E

A review in TV Guide by Adam Mersel said [...] "...Fey and the gang {{live up to the}} challenge, and produce [...] a hilarious, quite snotty episode that holds up to any comedy around." [...] Meredith Blake, writing for the Los Angeles Times, was positive towards the episode, reasoning that the writing [...] "is just so deliciously absurd that I can't help but giggle the whole way through", and that the plots featured here were [...] "sublimely inconsequential. Not a whole lot happened, but it was all very funny." [...] Nick Catucci from New York magazine, who did not enjoy the two other stories, appreciated Jenna's, explaining that by having the character date one of her own impersonator was [...] "outrageous and funny without relying on any cheap insults to trannies." [...] Sean Gandert from Paste magazine reported that [...] "Argus" [...] was an episode that [...] " [...] <b>us</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> show's roots", explaining that recapturing the [...] "old tone" [...] also worked to [...] "recapture the old joke-writing expertise. It wasn't 100% consistent, but there were so many good one-liners to counterbalance the misfires that it didn't even matter. This is 30 Rock the way it should be." [...] The Houston Press Daniel Carlson wrote that Grizz's wedding story was [...] "pure filler, but everything on the show's kind of filler for the wackiness, so it mostly worked." [...] Carlson wrote that the best part from [...] "Argus" [...] came with Forte's Paul as Jenna's boyfriend and impersonator.|$|E
