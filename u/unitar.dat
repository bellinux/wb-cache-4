40|$|The {{research}} {{attempts to}} do experimental and survey studies {{specifically designed to}} determine the effectiveness of Communicative Language Teaching in developing speaking proficiency in second language (L 2) among <b>Unitar's</b> students. Students were unable to construct and use sentences In the second language to communicate meaningfully and effectively outside the classroom. As stated in the research hypothesis, there Is no difference In students' speaking proficiency in second language after the English course. This necessitates the researcher to seek Hyme's notion of communicative competence and also suggestions by Krashen on his concept of leamingacquisition hypothesiS through various communicative learning activities. To address this pertinent language learning and acquisition issues, the researcher made an experimental study on 60 <b>Unitar's</b> undergraduate students. The instruments used to evaluate students speaking proficiency was the oral tests In the pretest and posttest for both the experimental and control groups. The students under study took the English as second language course for the whole January semester, emphasizing on enhancing communicative competency for the experimental group and the ordinary teaching that focused on grammar and structure to the control group. Despite the limitation of the study, the researcher has achieved to get a complete data derived from the oral tests and questionnaire. This enabled the researcher to get statistical analysis. As a whole, the study shows a general insight {{into some of the}} vital findings about communicative language learning in the classroom, at the same time contributed suggestions to educators and other researchers of some tips in developing speaking proficiency in the target language in the future...|$|R
30|$|There was an {{immediate}} international response and reaction after the main shock at 05 : 54 local time at 27 May 2006. Approximately 100 response operations reacted quickly and brought to a rapid acquisition of satellite imagery to support the preliminary damage assessment process. A variety of damage maps were available in {{a week after the}} earthquake. Those damage maps mostly were produced by UN Institute for Training and Research (<b>UNITAR)’s</b> Operational Satellite Applications Programs (UNOSAT) (Kerle, 2010). The rapid ground survey was conducted by the Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM) in Yogyakarta. As a result, an extensive database of building type, function and construction material of affected buildings were made available soon after the earthquake.|$|R

The rationale for this is clear. The UNFCCC seeks to strengthen non-Annex 1 countries’ effective participation in the Kyoto Protocol process, and to strengthen existing and/or establish new training and research institutions to ensure sustainability of capacity building programmes. These capacity building initiatives should be country driven, involve stakeholder participation, and address specific needs and conditions of the country. For this reason, the ERC is developing training modules on climate change mitigation. ENDA is developing modules on climate change on vulnerability and adaptation; and MIND on sustainable development...|$|R

Four {{days after the}} earthquake, the Italian Space Agency's (ASI's) COSMO-SkyMed Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite acquired data over Kathmandu area. Nine days after the earthquake, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's (JAXA's) ALOS- 2 SAR satellite covered larger area. Using these radar observations, we rapidly produced damage proxy maps derived from temporal changes in Interferometric SAR (InSAR) coherence. These maps were qualitatively validated through comparison with independent damage analyses by National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and the <b>UNITAR's</b> (United Nations Institute for Training and Research's) Operational Satellite Applications Programme (UNOSAT), and based on our own visual inspection of DigitalGlobe's WorldView optical pre- vs. post-event imagery.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the level of readiness towards virtual learning among students. Virtual learning is a learning process that incorporates the using of information and communication technology that are neither bound by location nor time. The objectives of the study are to determine students' computer knowledge and literacy on selected computer applications measured based on the level of familiarity, level of competency and frequency of usage, to determine students' level of motivation and learning management towards learning virtually and to know students' perceptions towards effectiveness and advantages of virtual learning. This study used descriptive analysis to analyze the result. The sample used are undergraduates who are currently studying at <b>UNITAR's</b> study center at Kolej Shahputra, Pekan, Pahang Darul Makmur. Data collected was analyzed by using SPSS version 11. 0 and shows that they are ready to adapt virtual learning instead of conventional learning.
