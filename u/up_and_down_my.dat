Michael Nelson of Stereogum commented, [...] "This {{is just a}} haunting, hypnotic piece of music that sends chills <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>my</b> entire skeleton, especially when the tempo shifts downward on the chorus". Nylon writer Liza Darwin deemed the track [...] "silky-smooth" [...] and [...] "total ear candy". Lauren Valenti of Marie Claire lauded the song as [...] "a slice of retro heaven". The track was noted by Stern to be [...] "revolutionary" [...] {{in the sense that}} it sounded [...] "entirely different from anything being offered in pop music at the moment" [...] and deemed it [...] "the very antithesis of everything radio in 2014". Kyle Fowle of The A.V. Club named [...] "West Coast" [...] as the album's most accomplished track and [...] "the one song on Ultraviolence that gets the formula of Lana Del Rey right". AltSounds deemed the track as one of Del Rey's best works and one of the best singles released in 2014. The publication went on to opine, [...] "when songs defy descriptions, and artists defy expectation, they tend to stick around long after the 'pop hits' and divas have suck back into obscurity". Oyster journalist Jerico Mandybur commented, [...] "there's no denying that the song has excellent aural pulling power, especially if you like your odes to LA mysterious, darkly surfy and dripping in femme fatale".|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{can fully}} believe it of her. Hers {{have not been}} the <b>ups</b> <b>and</b> <b>downs</b> of <b>my</b> Angela, though indeed, after all she has gone through, there is {{something}} in her face that brings to my mind, 'After that ye have suffered awhile, stablish, strengthen, settle you.'" ...|$|R
60|$|Robina {{took her}} by the arm <b>and</b> walked her <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> just {{underneath}} <b>my</b> window. I listened, because the conversation interested me.|$|R
60|$|I saw {{the arrow}} leap up, miss Lop-Ear, glance against a limb, and fall {{back to the}} ground. I danced <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> on <b>my</b> lofty perch with delight. It was a game! The Fire-Man was {{throwing}} things at Lop-Ear as we sometimes threw things at one another.|$|R
60|$|I {{knew what}} that meant, and a cold shiver went <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>my</b> backbone. But I looked down at him--spick-and-span and glossy--his neckties are never crooked--and said, yes, he might come at three o'clock.|$|E
60|$|I had an {{exquisite}} moment. It was unique also. Jumping {{up from my}} seat, I paced <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>my</b> room for a long time. But when I came downstairs I behaved with sufficient composure. Only I couldn't eat anything at dinner.|$|E
60|$|In my rooms a {{surprise}} awaited me. Felicia was there, walking nervously <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>my</b> little sitting-room She stopped short as I entered and came swiftly towards me. In {{the joy of}} seeing her so unexpectedly I would have taken her into my arms, but she shrank back.|$|E
6000|$|... "What'd you say?" [...] asked Ken, pretending curiosity. Suddenly {{he began}} to jump <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down.</b> [...] "Oh, <b>my!</b> Hullabelee! Schoodoorady! What a chance! You gave it away!" ...|$|R
5000|$|On 16 June 2013, Petr Nečas {{announced}} that he would resign on Monday, 17 June 2013.

I want to emphasize that I'm aware of my political responsibility and I draw the consequences from that", he said.|$|R
60|$|She {{stepped forward}} on {{her bare feet}} as firm on that floor which seemed to heave <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> before <b>my</b> eyes as she had ever been—goatherd child leaping on the rocks of her native hills which she was never to see again. I {{snatched}} the arrow of gold {{from the table and}} threw it after her.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are plain Mr. Gerard now," [...] said he, [...] "and a Channel Islander. I {{would be}} obliged {{to you if you}} would kindly forget your {{military}} ways and drop your cavalry swagger when you walk <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>my</b> deck. A beard, too, would seem more sailor-like than those moustaches." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's nothin' else I {{can think}} of," [...] said Mrs. Aleshine; [...] "at least, nothin' I can carry; and so I suppose we {{may as well}} begin, for your talk of the ship sinkin' under our feet gives me a sort o' feelin' like an oyster creepin' <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>my</b> back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Such {{a thrill}} as went <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>my</b> back, Marilla! I don't think I'd ever really {{believed}} until then {{that there was}} honestly {{going to be a}} picnic. I couldn't help fearing I'd only imagined it. But when a minister says a thing in the pulpit you just have to believe it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He did,' {{answered}} Fledgeby. 'The assassin. Lammle. He {{rubbed it}} into my mouth <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> nose <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>my</b> throat--Ow! Ow! Ow! Ah--h--h--h! Ugh!--to prevent my crying out, and then cruelly assaulted me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, good gracious!" [...] {{cried the}} lady.--"aren't they {{different}} from us in every way? To be sure, they {{dress up in}} their ridiculous best when they go out, but you couldn't expect us to let them use the front elevator? I don't want to go <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> with <b>my</b> own cook, and I certainly don't with my neighbor's cook!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There!" [...] he said, [...] "we're {{going to}} throw out a bay-window here, so as get the water all the way <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down.</b> This is <b>my</b> girls' room," [...] he added, looking proudly at them both.|$|R
60|$|It was horrible. I was {{trembling}} all over, and I {{could feel the}} shivers running <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>my</b> spine and the sweat standing out on my forehead. Surely {{there can be little}} in this world more awful than the spectacle of a strong man in the moment when he is utterly weak and broken.|$|E
6000|$|The {{return of}} my companions {{prevented}} any open demonstration of my fears and condition of mind, but I certainly swore inwardly. During the dinner hour I felt {{all the time}} as if I had on a horsehair shirt with the ends protruding toward my skin, and, in the exaggerated sensitiveness of the moment, made sure [...] "'em" [...] were chasing <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>my</b> back.|$|E
6000|$|Now, {{whether it}} were by {{peculiar}} grace, [...] 50 [...] A leading from above, a something given, [...] Yet it befel, that, in this lonely place, [...] When <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>my</b> fancy thus was driven, [...] And I with these untoward thoughts had striven, [...] I saw a Man before me unawares: [...] The oldest Man he seem'd that ever wore grey hairs.|$|E
60|$|As I {{sit here}} and muse on it all, the footfalls of the death-watch going <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> outside <b>my</b> cage, the man's {{suspicious}} eyes ever peering in on me, almost I weary of eternal recurrence. I have lived so many lives. I weary of the endless struggle and pain and catastrophe that come to those who sit in the high places, tread the shining ways, and wander among the stars.|$|R

40|$|To my wife, {{parents and}} sister… ii Acknowledgments First of all, I {{would like to}} extend my heartfelt thanks to my advisor, Jerry Hobbs, for his {{continuous}} support and inspiring guidance during my graduate career.

60|$|Do {{not let it}} be {{supposed}} that I had become a swash-buckler of a soldier. The cold chill of fear still crept <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>my</b> spine whenever I thought of taking part in an engagement; but I was becoming so nearly a man as to desire, in case it became necessary to fight, that I might gain some honor for standing stiffly when really my heart was faint.|$|E
6000|$|As I go <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>my</b> stair {{and pass}} the gilded Moorish wedding-chest where I keep my [...] "barbarous words," [...] I wonder will I take to them once more, for I am baffled by those voices that still speak as to Odysseus but as the bats; or now that I shall in a little be growing old, {{to some kind of}} simple piety like that of an old woman.|$|E
60|$|I now {{understood}} {{full well}} {{what was his}} plan. We were to engage the enemy in a regular battle so that the other sloop, laden with provisions, might succeed in going free. I am willing to confess that despite all my previous longings to show myself worthy of being a soldier, the cold chill of fear began to run <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>my</b> spine, as I realized that the time was come when we must strive to kill while others were {{doing their best to}} shed our blood.|$|E
40|$|Thank you to {{everyone}} who has encouraged and supported me throughout my academic aspirations and helped make this thesis possible.

Interested in deejaying from an early age, Cassidy {{describes}} himself as a [...] "hip-hop kid": [...] "When I was three years old, I would watch cult classic dance films Breakin' and Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo. When I was five years old, I would jump <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> on <b>my</b> bed to Run DMC. When I was 13, I idolized Grandmaster Flash, DJ Kool Herc, and Afrika Bambaataa.

60|$|MY DEAR SYMONDS, - Yes, we {{have both}} been very neglectful. I had horrid luck, {{catching}} two thundering influenzas in August and November. I recovered from the last with difficulty, but have come through this blustering winter with some general success; in the house, <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down.</b> <b>My</b> wife, however, has been painfully upset by my health. Last year, of course, was cruelly trying to her nerves; Nice and Hyeres are bad experiences; and though she is not ill, the doctor tells me that prolonged anxiety may do her a real mischief.|$|E
60|$|Ant. Why, then I yet am so; for {{thou art}} all. If I had any joy when thou wert absent, I grudged it to myself; methought I robbed Thee of thy part. But, oh, my Dolabella! Thou hast beheld me other than I am. Hast thou not seen my morning {{chambers}} filled With sceptered slaves, who waited to salute me? With eastern monarchs, who forgot the sun, To worship my uprising? menial kings Ran coursing <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>my</b> palace-yard, Stood silent in my presence, watched my eyes, And, at my least command, all started out, Like racers to the goal[2].|$|E
60|$|You are right, Sir, I {{very seldom}} speak of my halcyon days--those {{days when the}} {{greatest}} monarch {{the world has ever}} known honoured me with his intimacy and confidence. I had my office in the Rue St. Roch then, {{at the top of a}} house just by the church, and not a stone's throw from the palace, and I can tell you, Sir, that in those days ministers of state, foreign ambassadors, aye! and members of His Majesty's household, were <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>my</b> staircase at all hours of the day. I had not yet met Theodore then, and fate was wont to smile on me.|$|E
60|$|At that I grew again impatient. I {{thought of}} Roxalanne {{and of how}} she must be suffering, and I bethought me that every moment Mironsac now {{remained}} in my cell was another moment of torture for that poor child. So I urged him to be gone at once and carry news of my confinement to His Majesty. He obeyed me, and I was left alone once more, to pace <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> in <b>my</b> narrow cell, a prey to an excitement such as I should have thought I had outlived.|$|R
60|$|Benjy {{took the}} note, and {{departed}} nimbly to find Melisse, while I paced <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> in <b>my</b> uneasiness {{as to the}} outcome of the experiment. A quarter of an hour passed, half an hour, and then I saw Benjy coming through the trees. He stood before me, chuckling, and drew from his pocket a folded piece of paper. I gave him the two piastres, warned him if his master or any one inquired for me that I was taking a walk, and bade him begone. Then I opened the note.|$|R
6000|$|... "Run on, Baleka! run on!" [...] I said, {{dropping}} behind. Now she {{was almost}} blind with weariness and terror, and, not seeing my purpose, staggered towards {{the gate of the}} kraal. But I sat down on the veldt to get my breath again, for I was about to fight four men till I was killed. My heart beat and the blood drummed in my ears, but when they drew near and I rose--the assegai in my hand--once more the red cloth seemed to go <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> before <b>my</b> eyes, <b>and</b> all fear left me.|$|R
