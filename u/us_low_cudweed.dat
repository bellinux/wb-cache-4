We propose a development strategy commencing with a clear, intuitive and provably correct specification in a functional language such as Haskell. We then take this specification, and, applying a set of formal transformation laws, refine it into a behavioural definition in Handel-C, exposing the implicit parallelism along the way. This definition can then be compiled onto an FPGA...|$|R
