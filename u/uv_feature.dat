40|$|To {{examine a}} {{postulate}} that the horizontal momentum exchanges in the Venusian stratosphere are quasi-nondivergent, {{the properties of}} two-dimensional turbulence on a slowly rotating sphere in a high-resolution, one-level numerical model are investigated. It is concluded that the forcing which maintains the stratospheric flow is weak and influences the dynamics {{far less than the}} inertial effects. Consequently, the behavior resembles that of vorticity-conserving, two-dimensional flows. On a slowly rotating planet like Venus, such flows are dominated by solid-body rotation and by a planetary wave of unit zonal wavenumber - this wave corresponds to the observed Y-shaped <b>UV</b> <b>feature.</b> Although these largest scales of motion stand out, the dynamic balances of the flow are fundamentally nonlinear, in contrast to the quasi-linear Rossby wave regime on rapidly rotating planets...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Constraints on the {{possible}} shape and clustering, as well as optical properties, of grains responsible for the 2175 ˚A interstellar extinction feature (interstellar UV bump) are discussed. These constraints {{are based on the}} observation that the peak position of the interstellar <b>UV</b> <b>feature</b> is very stable (variations ∼ 1 %), that the large variations in width (< ∼ 25 %) are uncorrelated with the peak position except for the widest bumps, and that the shape of the feature is described extremely well by a Drude profile. The UV extinction of small graphite grains is computed for various clustering models involving Rayleigh spheres. It is shown that compact clusters qualitatively satisfy the above observational constraints, except that the peak position falls at the wrong wavelength. As an alternative to graphite to model the optical properties of the interstellar <b>UV</b> <b>feature</b> carrier, a single-Lorentz oscillator model is considered, in conjunction with a clustering model based on clusters of spheres. Intrinsic changes in the peak position and width are attributed to variations in chemical composition of the grains, impacting upon the parameters of the Lorentz oscillator. Further broadening is attributed to clustering. These models are shown to satisfy the above observational constraints. Furthermore, the correlated shift of peak position with increased width, observed for the widest interstellar UV features, is reproduced. Models involving a second Lorentz oscillator to reproduce the FUV rise are also considered. The impact of this extra Lorentz oscillator on the peak position, width, and shape of the bump is investigated.

40|$|In {{order to}} realize the {{non-contact}} measurement of ceramic insulator contamination severity, a method based on feature level fusion of infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) image information is proposed in this paper. IR and UV images of artificially polluted insulators were obtained from high voltage experiments at 80 %, 85 % and 90 % RH. After the preprocessing of images, IR and <b>UV</b> <b>features</b> were calculated, respectively.

40|$|In {{the early}} 1970 's, {{ground-based}} astronomers had already discovered that Ultraviolet (UV) cloud markings on Venus reappeared every 4 days. When radar evidence later revealed a 243 -day rotation {{period for the}} solid planet, planetary scientists were faced with a quandary: Could the Venus atmosphere really move 60 {{times as fast as}} the planet below, or were the apparent movements of the <b>UV</b> <b>features</b> just an illusion caused by propagating waves? The former explanation seemed unlikely - a planet that hardly rotates should generate only a very sluggish circulation. The historical impact of Jerry Schubert's moving flame theory was twofold: It was the forerunner of current thermal tide explanations of the cloud-level superrotation, but it was also the first plausible mechanism for explaining a seemingly inconsistent set of observations. In 1974, Mariner 10 acquired UV images of the Venus clouds at unprecedented levels of detail. Although few have noted it, this began the shift of planetary atmospheric research primarily from the domain of astronomy to that of meteorology. Jerry was among the first scientists to apply terrestrial meteorology to the analysis of planetary data. At that time a young UCLA graduate student with plans to do research on mantle convection, but having flunked the solid earth geophysics section of his departmental comprehensive exam, was gently invited by Jerry to switch to atmospheric science. Jerry suggested that the Venus <b>UV</b> <b>features</b> could be revealing both superrotating winds and planetary-scale waves at the same time, and that we could distinguish the two by looking at motions on different spatial scales. This was my first science research lesson - the complexity of real geophysical systems. Over {{the next couple of years}} I was inculcated with Jerry's philosophy of a comprehensive, rigorous approach to research, which manifested itself as a scouring of the literature and the UCLA meteorology faculty to learn about every possible type of planetary-scale wave. The resulting identification of large-scale <b>UV</b> <b>features</b> on Venus as the product of Kelvin and Rossby-type wave motions was validated by extensive Pioneer Venus observations a decade later and remains one of the best examples of the use of terrestrial knowledge to understand other planets...|$|R

The characteristic analysis of UV radiation shows distinctly hourly and monthly variations at two typical sites. The maximum values can represent the hourly <b>UV</b> <b>feature,</b> and the median and the arithmetic mean values are reasonably similar with little difference for both stations. The monthly means of hourly UV radiation range from 25. 68 to 70. 07 kJ m- 2 for DL and between 36. 00 and 92. 62 kJ m- 2 for TL. The monthly mean hourly UV fractions vary from 3. 79 % to 4. 93 % at DL and between 4. 57 % and 5. 94 % at TL. Comparisons on the monthly mean hourly values of UV radiation and UV fraction, the values at TL are always greater than those at DL. An innovative model is constructed based on two input parameters, namely the effect of the comprehensive attenuation factors for assumed cloud-free conditions (CAFUVclear) and the effect of the clouds (Kg). CAFUVclear is derived from empirical models based on relative optical air mass and ozone. The effectiveness of the presented model is demonstrated by comparing with other two estimation models.

We present {{preliminary}} results from spectral synthesis models of old stellar populations for the spectral range 912 - 4000 ˚A with ∼ 10 ˚A resolution, {{which can be}} used to investigate the UVX phenomenon and to assess ages and abundances. Model spectra incorporating extreme horizontal branch (EHB) and Post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (P-AGB) populations give good matches to the far-UV spectra of galaxies.

Once the hot component that gives rise to the UVX phenomenon is accounted for, the mid-UV wavelength range (2200 < λ < 3300 ˚A) provides information about the age and metallicity of the underlying stellar population.

Laboratory absorption-coefficient measurements of a dilute solution of croconic acid in sulfuric acid are used as the bases of cloud-scattering models; the Venus planetary albedo's observed behavior in the blue and near-UV are noted to be qualitatively reproduced. Attention is given to a plausible croconic acid-production mechanism for the Venus cloudtop region...|$|R
40|$|Infrared and UV-visible {{absorption}} spectra have been measured {{on the same}} sample of matrix-isolated carbon vapor {{in order to establish}} correlations between absorption intensities of vibrational and electronic transitions as a function of sample annealing. A high degree of correlation has been found between the IR feature at 1998 /cm recently assigned to C 8 and a <b>UV</b> absorption <b>feature</b> at about 3100 A. Thus, for the first time, direct evidence is given for the assignment of one of the unknown UV-visible features of the long-studied matrix-isolated carbon vapor spectrum...|$|R
40|$|Discrete dipole {{approximation}} {{calculations of}} the optical properties of random fractal aggregates of graphite spheroids show a <b>UV</b> absorption <b>feature</b> {{that is too}} wide and centered at too long a wavelength to fit the observed interstellar 2200 -A feature, but {{which is a good}} match to the 2400 -A feature seen in the hydrogen-deficient R CrB stars reported by Hecht et al. (1984). Graphite fractal grains also match the UV bump and large long-wavelenvth extinction seen in laboratory studies of carbon smoke published by Bussoletti et al. (1987), which are usually attributed to amorphous carbon...|$|R
