40|$|Chemical-looping combustion, CLC, is a {{technology}} with inherent {{separation of the}} greenhouse gas CO 2. The technique uses an oxygen carrier made up of particulate metal oxide to transfer oxygen from combustion air to fuel. In this work, an oxygen carrier consisting of 60 % NiO and 40 % NiAl 2 O 4 was used in a 10 kW CLC reactor system for 160 h of operation with fuel. The first 3 h of fuel operation excepted, the test series was accomplished with the same batch of oxygen carrier particles. The fuel used in the experiments was natural gas, and a fuel conversion to CO 2 of approximately 99 % was accomplished. Combustion conditions were very stable during the test period, except for the operation at sub-stoichiometric conditions. It was shown that the methane fraction in the fuel reactor exit gas was dependent upon the rate of solids circulation, with higher circulation leading to more <b>unconverted</b> methane. The <b>carbon</b> monoxide fraction was found to follow the thermodynamical equilibrium for all investigated fuel reactor temperatures, 660 – 950 C. Thermal analysis of the fuel reactor at stable conditions enabled calculation of the particle circulation which {{was found to be}} approximately 4 kg/s, MW. The loss of fines, i. e. the amount of elutriated oxygen carrier particles with diameter < 45 mm, decreased during the entire test period. After 160 h of operation the fractional loss of fines was 0. 00022 h- 1, corresponding to a particle life time of 4500 h...|$|R

40|$|This is {{a report}} of {{a study of the}} effect, on the rate of growth of type I pneumo-coccus in broth culture, of {{additions}} of an extract prepared from washed red blood cells and containing carbonic anhydrase. Carbonic anhydrase is an enzyme found by Meldrum and Roughton to act as a catalyst for the reversible reaction: CO 2 + H 20 = H 2 CO, = H+ + HCOi-. This reaction tends to proceed toward the right under the conditions of active carbon dioxide production and sustained alkalinity (pH 7. 0 to 8. 3, Dernby and Avery) present in broth containing growing pneumococci. When the reaction proceeds slowly, accumulation of a back-log of <b>unconverted</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide is possible and the concentration of carbon dioxide can rise progressively toward higher levels. When the reaction proceeds rapidly, as under the influence of a catalyst, accumulation of carbon dioxide is less possible and rise toward pro-gressively higher concentrations more difficult. Carbon dioxide has been suggested by Walker as a requirement for the initia-tion of growth by bacteria sensitive to carbon dioxide loss (Rockwell and High-berger; Valley and Rettger; Gladstone, Fildes and Richardson; Rahn; Rose).

A second smaller slag sample will be used for confirmatory testing. The expanded slag aggregates will then be tested for their suitability in manufacturing precast concrete products (e. g., masonry blocks and roof tiles) and insulating concrete, first at the laboratory scale and subsequently in commercial manufacturing plants. These products will be evaluated using ASTM and industry test methods. Technical data generated during production and testing of the products will be used to assess the overall technical viability of expanded slag production.

40|$|Automobile {{exhaust gas}} {{conversion}} was simulated with a reactor model based on first principles. The monolithic reactor was modelled as adiabatically operating with a uniform flow distribution over the channels and with constant heat and mass transfer coefficients. The kinetic rate equations {{in the model}} were constructed from elementary step kinetics of the individual global reactions. The model predictions for light-off curves compare quite well with experimental data from the literature. Light-off is in the sequence hydrogen, carbon monoxide, propene, but the light-off temperatures do not differ very much. The nitric oxide conversion as function of the reactor feed temperature passes through a maximum at high hydrocarbon conversion, but does not reach the level of 50 %, defined as light-off. Hydrogen is the major oxygen consumer in the front part of the reactor, while a slow reaction proceeds between CO and NO. At sufficiently high feed temperatures thermal reactor ignition occurs when the degree of CO surface coverage drops considerably. The corresponding increase of the O adatoms coverage causes increased reaction rates and a sudden temperature rise. Beyond the ignition point oxygen is mainly consumed by propene and by <b>unconverted</b> <b>carbon</b> monoxide. NO is reduced by unconverted hydrogen, while NO reduction by the hydrocarbon is not significant. Catalysts capable of increasing the NO surface coverage or the NO dissociation, or leading to a lower oxygen sticking coefficient would show a higher NO conversion maximum. The results indicate that well-known reaction mechanisms are capable to describe the behaviour of automotive exhaust gas converters, if mutual interactions of gaseous components and surface species {{are taken into account}} via elementary step kinetics...|$|E
40|$|Entrained-flow {{slagging}} coal gasifiers display large conversion efficiencies and small levels of <b>unconverted</b> <b>carbon</b> at the exhaust. Both features are apparently {{at odds with}} the fairly small “space-time”of the particle-laden gas feeding, as compared with the time scale of heterogeneous gasification of carbon. This apparent inconsistency can be explained by considering that fuel residence times are longer than the “space-time”due to segregation of fuel particles in the near-wall region of the gasifier. Segregation is promoted by swirl flow, by particle–wall interaction as the wall is covered by a molten layer of slag and by the establishment of a dense-dispersed flow of granular solids in the proximity of the wall. This study presents results of granular flow simulations of the interaction of a dense-dispersed parti- cle flow with the confining wall. Simulations consider that both the particles and the wall may be either “sticky”or “non sticky”, based on the prevailing elastic vs plastic behaviour upon collision. The effect of drag forces exerted on particles by swirled gas flow is simulated in a simplified manner. Particle–particle collisions are modelled with a Hertzian approach that includes torque and cohesion. The extent and time scale of segregation of a lump of particles loaded into a cylindrical vessel are assessed. Results clearly indicate the different structure of the layer of particles establishing at the wall surface in the different interaction regimes. Results of simulations are qualitatively compared with results of an experimental campaign performed in a reactor representing a cold flow model of the entrained-flow gasifier, where solid, molten or semi- molten particles have been simulated by atomized wax as surrogate material. Altogether, the results con- firm the importance of the particle–particle and particle–wall micromechanical interactions for a correct prevision of the segregation of fuel particles in entrained-flow slagging gasifiers...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the gas {{switching}} combustion (GSC) {{concept is}} further investigated with a sensitivity {{analysis for the}} fuel and oxygen carrier types. The GSC concept offers {{an alternative to the}} conventional chemical looping combustion (CLC) process for power production with integrated CO 2 capture. In this concept, oxidation and reduction of the oxygen carrier take place in the same reactor by alternating air and fuel gas feeds into the reactor. This completely avoids any need for oxygen carrier circulation and thereby avoids many technical and scale-up challenges related to the looping concept. First demonstration of the concept with carbon monoxide (CO) as reducing gas and Ni-based oxygen carrier showed that the reactor could operate autothermally to continuously convert cold feed gases into hot product gases. This work consists of two parts: Firstly, the GSC concept is further experimentally tested with syngas and methane as reducing gases on the same Ni-based oxygen carrier as used in the first demonstration. This experimental study is then followed by a more detailed thermodynamic analysis where the bed temperature variation sensitivity to the oxygen carrier and fuel is investigated. As for the experimental study, syngas showed complete conversion with no carbon deposition, leading thereby to high CO 2 purity (95 %) and capture efficiency (95 %). Lower CO 2 purity was achieved (~ 80 %) when methane was used which was mainly caused by unconverted fuel and the existence of <b>unconverted</b> <b>carbon</b> monoxide as side product. Increasing the operating temperature slightly enhanced methane conversion to 84 % which is still below expectations. High CO 2 capture efficiency (95 %) has however been achieved due to the absence of carbon deposition. Thermodynamically, the influence of four different oxygen carrier materials on the temperature variation across the GSC cycle has been determined. Minimization of the temperature variation across the cycle is important in order to maximize the electric efficiency of the process and prevent turbine wear. The temperature variation across the four oxygen carriers and two fuel types investigated varied by a factor of 5 and specific recommendations were given to keep this variation to a minimum...|$|E
