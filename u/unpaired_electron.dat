5|$|In {{ferromagnetic}} {{elements such}} as iron, cobalt and nickel, an odd number of electrons leads to an <b>unpaired</b> <b>electron</b> and a net overall magnetic moment. The orbitals of neighboring atoms overlap and a lower energy state is achieved when the spins of unpaired electrons are aligned with each other, a spontaneous process known as an exchange interaction. When the magnetic moments of ferromagnetic atoms are lined up, the material can produce a measurable macroscopic field. Paramagnetic materials have atoms with magnetic moments that line up in random directions when no magnetic field is present, but the magnetic moments of the individual atoms line up {{in the presence of}} a field.|$|E
5|$|Nitric oxide (NO) is the {{simplest}} stable molecule {{with an odd}} number of electrons. In mammals, including humans, {{it is an important}} cellular signaling molecule involved in many physiological and pathological processes. It is formed by catalytic oxidation of ammonia. It is a colourless paramagnetic gas that, being thermodynamically unstable, decomposes to nitrogen and oxygen gas at 1100–1200°C. Its bonding is similar to that in nitrogen, but one extra electron is added to a π* antibonding orbital and thus the bond order has been reduced to approximately 2.5; hence dimerisation to O=N–N=O is unfavourable except below the boiling point (where the cis isomer is more stable) because it does not actually increase the total bond order and because the <b>unpaired</b> <b>electron</b> is delocalised across the NO molecule, granting it stability. There is also evidence for the asymmetric red dimer O=N–O=N when nitric oxide is condensed with polar molecules. It reacts with oxygen to give brown nitrogen dioxide and with halogens to give nitrosyl halides. It also reacts with transition metal compounds to give nitrosyl complexes, most of which are deeply coloured.|$|E
25|$|The g-factor and hyperfine {{coupling}} in an atom or molecule {{may not be}} the same for all orientations of an <b>unpaired</b> <b>electron</b> in an external magnetic field. This anisotropy depends upon the electronic structure of the atom or molecule (e.g., free radical) in question, and so can provide information about the atomic or molecular orbital containing the <b>unpaired</b> <b>electron.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{most stable}} {{examples}} of <b>unpaired</b> <b>electrons</b> are {{found on the}} atoms and ions of lanthanides. The incomplete f-shell of these entities does not interact very strongly with the environment they are in and this prevents them from being paired. The ions with {{the largest number of}} <b>unpaired</b> <b>electrons</b> are Gd3+ and Cm3+ with seven <b>unpaired</b> <b>electrons.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Due to its 4 <b>unpaired</b> <b>electrons</b> in 3d shell, an iron atom has {{a strong}} {{magnetic}} moment. Ions [...] have also 4 <b>unpaired</b> <b>electrons</b> in 3d shell and [...] have 5 <b>unpaired</b> <b>electrons</b> in 3d shell. Therefore, when crystals are formed from iron atoms or ions [...] and [...] they can be in ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic states.|$|R
50|$|Ethenediylidene {{is viewed}} as {{ethylene}} with four hydrogen atoms removed. By default, this name pays no regard to the electronic state of the diatomic carbon. When the electronic state is considered, the states with no <b>unpaired</b> <b>electrons</b> are named ethenediylidene, whereas the states with two <b>unpaired</b> <b>electrons</b> are named ethenediyldiylidene, and the states with four <b>unpaired</b> <b>electrons</b> are named ethenetetrayl.|$|R
25|$|Since {{the source}} of an EPR {{spectrum}} {{is a change in}} an electron's spin state, it might be thought that all EPR spectra for a single electron spin would consist of one line. However, the interaction of an <b>unpaired</b> <b>electron,</b> by way of its magnetic moment, with nearby nuclear spins, results in additional allowed energy states and, in turn, multi-lined spectra. In such cases, the spacing between the EPR spectral lines indicates the degree of interaction between the <b>unpaired</b> <b>electron</b> and the perturbing nuclei. The hyperfine coupling constant of a nucleus {{is directly related to the}} spectral line spacing and, in the simplest cases, is essentially the spacing itself.|$|E
25|$|As {{a second}} example, {{consider}} the methoxymethyl radical, H2C(OCH3). The two equivalent methyl hydrogens will give an overall 1:2:1 EPR pattern, each component {{of which is}} further split by the three methoxy hydrogens into a 1:3:3:1 pattern to give a total of 3×4= 12 lines, a triplet of quartets. A simulation of the observed EPR spectrum is shown at the right and agrees with the 12-line prediction and the expected line intensities. Note that the smaller coupling constant (smaller line spacing) {{is due to the}} three methoxy hydrogens, while the larger coupling constant (line spacing) is from the two hydrogens bonded directly to the carbon atom bearing the <b>unpaired</b> <b>electron.</b> It is often the case that coupling constants decrease in size with distance from a radical's <b>unpaired</b> <b>electron,</b> but there are some notable exceptions, such as the ethyl radical (CH2CH3).|$|E
25|$|The N-V0 {{thus has}} one <b>unpaired</b> <b>electron</b> and is paramagnetic. However, despite {{extensive}} efforts, {{electron paramagnetic resonance}} signals from N-V0 avoided detection for decades until 2008. Optical excitation is required to bring the N-V0 defect into the EPR-detectable excited state; the signals from the ground state are presumably too broad for EPR detection.|$|E
50|$|The {{multiplicity}} {{of a state}} is defined as 2S + 1, where S is the total electronic spin. A high multiplicity state is therefore {{the same as a}} high-spin state. The lowest-energy state with maximum multiplicity usually has <b>unpaired</b> <b>electrons</b> all with parallel spin. Since the spin of each electron is 1/2, the total spin is one-half the number of <b>unpaired</b> <b>electrons,</b> and the multiplicity is the number of <b>unpaired</b> <b>electrons</b> + 1. For example, the nitrogen atom ground state has three <b>unpaired</b> <b>electrons</b> of parallel spin, so that the total spin is 3/2 and the multiplicity is 4.|$|R
50|$|Relatively {{more stable}} {{entities}} with <b>unpaired</b> <b>electrons</b> do exist, e.g. the nitric oxide molecule has one. According to Hund's rule, the spins of <b>unpaired</b> <b>electrons</b> are aligned parallel and this gives these molecules paramagnetic properties.|$|R
25|$|All {{of these}} {{structures}} are paramagnetic (have <b>unpaired</b> <b>electrons),</b> not diamagnetic. Thus, a non-intuitive (e.g., a higher-energy {{for at least}} one species) distribution of electrons in the combination of iron and oxygen must exist, in order to explain the observed diamagnetism and no <b>unpaired</b> <b>electrons.</b>|$|R
25|$|With one <b>{{unpaired}}</b> <b>electron</b> μeff values {{range from}} 1.8 to 2.5 μB and with two unpaired electrons the range is 3.18 to 3.3 μB. Note that low-spin complexes of Fe2+ and Co3+ are diamagnetic. Another group of complexes that are diamagnetic are square-planar complexes of d8 ions such as Ni2+ and Rh+ and Au3+.|$|E
25|$|Pulsed {{electron}} paramagnetic resonance {{could be}} advanced into electron nuclear double resonance spectroscopy (ENDOR), which utilizes waves in the radio frequencies. Since different nuclei with unpaired electrons respond to different wavelengths, radio frequencies are required at times. Since {{the results of the}} ENDOR gives the coupling resonance between the nuclei and the <b>unpaired</b> <b>electron,</b> the relationship between them can be determined.|$|E
25|$|Mechanisms 1 and 2 {{represent}} hydride gain, {{in which}} the molecule gains what amounts to be one hydride ion. Mechanisms 3 and 4 radical formation and hydride loss. Radical species contain <b>unpaired</b> <b>electron</b> atoms and are very chemically active. Hydride loss is the inverse process of the hydride gain seen before. The final two mechanisms show nucleophilic addition and a reaction using a carbon radical.|$|E

25|$|Electron spin {{resonance}} (ESR) is {{a related}} technique in which transitions between electronic spin levels are detected rather than nuclear ones. The basic principles are similar but the instrumentation, data analysis, and detailed theory are significantly different. Moreover, {{there is a}} much smaller number of molecules and materials with <b>unpaired</b> <b>electron</b> spins that exhibit ESR (or electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)) absorption than those that have NMR absorption spectra. ESR has much higher sensitivity than NMR does.|$|E
25|$|Compounds of gallium(II) were unknown until quite recently. As {{the atomic}} number of gallium {{is an odd}} number (31), Ga2+ should have an <b>unpaired</b> <b>electron.</b> It was assumed that it would act as a free radical and have a very short lifetime. The non-existence of Ga(II) {{compounds}} {{was part of the}} so-called inert pair effect. When salts of the anion with empirical formula such as − were synthesized they were found to be diamagnetic. This implied the formation of a Ga-Ga bond and a dimeric formula, 2−.|$|E
25|$|In a {{paramagnetic}} material there are unpaired electrons, i.e. atomic or molecular orbitals with exactly one electron in them. While paired electrons {{are required by}} the Pauli exclusion principle to have their intrinsic ('spin') magnetic moments pointing in opposite directions, causing their magnetic fields to cancel out, an <b>unpaired</b> <b>electron</b> is free to align its magnetic moment in any direction. When an external magnetic field is applied, these magnetic moments will tend to align themselves {{in the same direction}} as the applied field, thus reinforcing it.|$|E
50|$|Electronic {{spin state}} at it {{simplest}} describes {{the number of}} <b>unpaired</b> <b>electrons</b> in a molecule. Most molecules including the proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids {{that make up the}} majority of life have no <b>unpaired</b> <b>electrons</b> even when charged. Such molecules are called singlet molecules, since their paired electrons have only one spin state. In contrast, dioxygen under ambient conditions has two <b>unpaired</b> <b>electrons.</b> Dioxygen is a triplet molecule, since the two <b>unpaired</b> <b>electrons</b> allow for three spin states. The reaction of a triplet molecule with a singlet molecule is spin-forbidden in quantum mechanics. This is the major reasons there is a very high reaction barrier for the extremely thermodynamically favorable reaction of singlet organic molecules with triplet oxygen. This kinetic barrier prevents life from bursting into flames at room temperature.|$|R

25|$|Very few {{compounds}} of main group {{elements are}} paramagnetic. Notable examples include: oxygen, O2; nitric oxide, NO; nitrogen dioxide, NO2 and chlorine dioxide, ClO2. In organic chemistry, compounds with an <b>unpaired</b> <b>electron</b> {{are said to}} be free radicals. Free radicals, with some exceptions, are short-lived because one free radical will react rapidly with another, so their magnetic properties are difficult to study. However, if the radicals are well separated from each other in a dilute solution in a solid matrix, at low temperature, they can be studied by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Such radicals are generated by irradiation. Extensive EPR studies have revealed much about electron delocalization in free radicals. The simulated spectrum of the CH3• radical shows hyperfine splitting due to the interaction of the electron with the 3 equivalent hydrogen nuclei, each of which has a spin of 1/2.|$|E
25|$|EPR/ESR {{spectroscopy}} is used {{in various}} branches of science, such as biology, chemistry and physics, for the detection and identification of free radicals and paramagnetic centers such as F-centers. EPR is a sensitive, specific method for studying both radicals formed in chemical reactions and the reactions themselves. For example, when ice (solid H2O) is decomposed by exposure to high-energy radiation, radicals such as H, OH, and HO2 are produced. Such radicals can be identified and studied by EPR. Organic and inorganic radicals can be detected in electrochemical systems and in materials exposed to UV light. In many cases, the reactions to make the radicals and the subsequent reactions of the radicals are of interest, while in other cases EPR is used to provide information on a radical's geometry and the orbital of the <b>unpaired</b> <b>electron.</b> EPR/ESR spectroscopy is also used in geology and archaeology as a dating tool. It {{can be applied to}} a wide range of materials such as carbonates, sulfates, phosphates, silica or other silicates.|$|E
25|$|A {{metal ion}} {{with a single}} <b>unpaired</b> <b>electron,</b> such as Cu2+, in a {{coordination}} complex provides the simplest illustration of the mechanism of paramagnetism. The individual metal ions are kept far apart by the ligands, {{so that there is}} no magnetic interaction between them. The system is said to be magnetically dilute. The magnetic dipoles of the atoms point in random directions. When a magnetic field is applied, first-order Zeeman splitting occurs. Atoms with spins aligned to the field slightly outnumber the atoms with non-aligned spins. In the first-order Zeeman effect the energy difference between the two states is proportional to the applied field strength. Denoting the energy difference as ΔE, the Boltzmann distribution gives the ratio of the two populations as , where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature in kelvins. In most cases ΔE is much smaller than kT and the exponential can be expanded as 1 – ΔE/kT. It follows from the presence of 1/T in this expression that the susceptibility is inversely proportional to temperature.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the nearly}} free {{electron}} approximation {{is able to}} describe many properties of electron band structures, one consequence of this theory is that it predicts {{the same number of}} electrons in each unit cell. If the number of electrons is odd, we would then expect that there is an <b>unpaired</b> <b>electron</b> in each unit cell, and thus that the valence band is not fully occupied, making the material a conductor. However, materials such as CoO that have an odd number of electrons per unit cell are insulators, in direct conflict with this result. This kind of material is known as a Mott insulator, and requires inclusion of detailed electron-electron interactions (treated only as an averaged effect on the crystal potential in band theory) to explain the discrepancy. The Hubbard model is an approximate theory that can include these interactions. It can be treated non-perturbatively within the so-called dynamical mean field theory, which attempts {{to bridge the gap between}} the nearly free electron approximation and the atomic limit. Formally, however, the states are not non-interacting in this case and the concept of a band structure is not adequate to describe these cases.|$|E
25|$|Exchange {{interactions}} {{occur when}} the substance is not magnetically dilute and there are interactions between individual magnetic centres. One of the simplest systems to exhibit the result of exchange interactions is crystalline copper(II) acetate, Cu2(OAc)4(H2O)2. As the formula indicates, it contains two copper(II) ions. The Cu2+ ions are held together by four acetate ligands, each of which binds to both copper ions. Each Cu2+ ion has a d9 electronic configuration, and so should have one <b>unpaired</b> <b>electron.</b> If there were a covalent bond between the copper ions, the electrons would pair up and the compound would be diamagnetic. Instead, there is an exchange interaction in which the spins of the unpaired electrons become partially aligned to each other. In fact two states are created, one with spins parallel {{and the other with}} spins opposed. The energy difference between the two states is so small their populations vary significantly with temperature. In consequence the magnetic moment varies with temperature in a sigmoidal pattern. The state with spins opposed has lower energy, so the interaction can be classed as antiferromagnetic in this case. It is believed that {{this is an example of}} superexchange, mediated by the oxygen and carbon atoms of the acetate ligands. Other dimers and clusters exhibit exchange behaviour.|$|E
