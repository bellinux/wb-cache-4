40|$|A {{description}} is given {{of the relationship}} observed between enhancements in the far ultraviolet solar irradiance and {{the position of the}} solar magnetic sector boundaries. The ultraviolet observations were made with the monitor of <b>ultraviolet</b> solar <b>energy</b> (MUSE) experiments which were launched aboard Nimbus 3 in April 1969 and Nimbus 4 April 1970. A comparison between the positions of solar magnetic sector boundaries and ultraviolet enchancements of the sun seems to show, at least during the year of 1969, that the ultraviolet maxima tend to occur near the times when a solar sector boundary is near the central meridian. An estimate of the magnitude of the variable <b>ultraviolet</b> solar <b>energy</b> input into the atmosphere resulting from the rotation of active solar longitudes is that for wavelengths less that 175 nm and down to H Lyman alpha it exceeds the annual variation whereas at longer wavelengths it is less.

We consider the synchrotron emission from a region with a tangled magnetic field where relativistic non-thermal electrons are continuously injected in from an associated acceleration region. The acceleration region {{is assumed to be}} a compact zone possibly around a shock front. A power-law distribution of electrons is injected into the acceleration region and accelerated to a maximum energy determined by the acceleration time-scale and the loss processes.

In contrast to the other Tamaraneans shown on the series, all of whom have auburn or brown hair and bright green eyes with green sclera, Blackfire is shown to have black hair with purple streaks, and purple eyes with white sclera - likely a reference to her comic counterpart being born deformed by Tamaranean standards. She possesses superhuman strength, durability, reflexes, agility, endurance, FTL flight (a natural Tamaranian ability she lacked in the comics), as well as the ability to generate bright lilac-colored bolts of <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>energy</b> from her hands that are quite powerful and destructive, which are called [...] "blackbolts". In a contrast with her comic book depiction, Blackfire has the natural ability to fly faster-than-light through the air at will. Presumably, she has all of the same abilities as Starfire, as the two are quite evenly matched in combat. Her clothes in the series are quite similar to Starfire's as seen in the prequel episode [...] "Go!", but Starfire's was purple; whereas Blackfire's outfit is black and Starfire's skin showed while Blackfire's is covered by a metal plating of sorts. Blackfire's debut appearance came in the first-season episode [...] "Sisters", where Blackfire comes to Earth to visit Starfire. However, it is soon revealed that Blackfire is actually an infamous galactic criminal, and she has actually come to Earth in an attempt to frame her younger sister for her crimes. Fortunately, her plan was thwarted and the result ended in an epic fight between sisters. Their battle is interrupted when Blackfire is arrested by Centauri police forces. In Episode 29 [...] "Betrothed", Blackfire is revealed to have [...] "got bored" [...] and escaped galactic jail, and in control of Tamaran as the Empress. She used her authority to have Starfire married to a swamp alien in return for the magical Jewel of Charta, under the guise that Tamaran would be destroyed if Starfire did not comply. The Teen Titans soon discover that the elder sister's plan is a hoax, and Starfire proceeds to challenge Blackfire to a duel for the Tamaranean throne. The Jewel of Charta was shown to greatly enhance Blackfire's abilities (turning her starbolts from lavender to red at the time), until Starfire took the jewel from her sister by force and crushed it. After Blackfire was defeated by Starfire, Blackfire is then forced into exile. Blackfire hasn't been seen for the remainder of the show. The New Teen Titans animated short [...] "Blackfire's Babysitter" [...] depicts Blackfire as having quadruplets with the swamp alien she had attempted to force Starfire into marrying, but the animated short was created as a joke and is not considered canon.|$|E

The tunnel was made of polished aluminum and reflects beams of energy within the tunnel. <b>Ultraviolet</b> <b>energy</b> can improve food safety by destroying the microorganisms, such as E coli and salmonella that cause food-borne illnesses. <b>Ultraviolet</b> <b>energy</b> can extend shelf life of produce and make it possible to keep these foods for greater periods of time while keeping the integrity of the berry intact.

Results indicated that a significant shelf life extension of strawberries was achieved at each of these treatment levels. The average shelf life of non-treated berries was 14. 9 days whereas the average treated strawberries range from 17. 25 to 20. 9 days. A lowest level of treatment was reached at 15 seconds or 88 mj/cm 3. A statistical relationship between application rates and shelf life was determined.
