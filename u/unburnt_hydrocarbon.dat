This can increase the total charge entering the cylinder (as cooler air will be more dense), resulting in more power but also higher levels of hydrocarbon pollutants {{and lower levels of}} nitrogen oxide pollutants. With direct injection this effect is not as dramatic but it can cool down the combustion chamber enough to reduce certain pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), while raising others such as partially decomposed hydrocarbons.|$|E

40|$|Problem statement: Diesel engine emits more {{pollutants}} to atmosphere causing air pollution. This necessitates {{the search}} of a renewable alternate fuel which is environment friendly. The objective {{of this research was}} to investigate the environmental aspects of pongamia bio-fuel in a single cylinder diesel engine with the influence of fuel injection pressure. Approach: Bio-fuel was prepared from non-edible Pongamia pinnata oil by transesterification and used as a fuel in C. I engine. The effect of fuel injection pressure on the engine emission characteristics of a single cylinder direct injection diesel engine has been experimentally investigated using pongamia pinnata methyl ester and its blends with diesel fuel from 0 - 30 % with an increment of 5 % at full load. The tests were conducted at five different injection pressures (190, 200, 210, 220 and 230 KN m - 2) by means of adjusting injector spring tension. Results: Compared to diesel, blend B 5 exhibits lower engine emissions of <b>unburnt</b> <b>hydrocarbon,</b> carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen and carbon di oxide at full load. The High injection pressure of 220 KN m - 2 shows lesser emissions of <b>unburnt</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> and carbon monoxide while oxides of nitrogen and carbon dioxide are found to be slightly higher than diesel and blends at full load. Conclusion: From the test results, it was found that a high injection pressure of 220 KN m - 2 causes better atomization with improved engine emission characteristics for diesel and blends at full load.

40|$|Abstract: The paper reviews {{progress}} {{in the development of}} methods for calculating the properties of gas turbine combustion chambers, with particular attention being devoted to combustion and turbulence–combustion interactions. For conventional combustion chambers with non-premixed combustion it is argued that a conserved scalar approach, where burning is presumed to be ‘fast’, is capable of providing an accurate representation of heat-releasing processes. The approach can also be extended to include NO 2 formation, at least under conditions where it is formed under high-temperature conditions. However, if carbon monoxide and <b>unburnt</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> emissions or partially premixed combustion is to be considered, then a more complete description of combustion is needed and the probability density function (PDF) transport equation method here represents a promising approach.

40|$|The {{treatment}} of vehicle emissions with an exhaust catalyst {{in order to}} reduce the level of three major air pollutants, namely carbon monoxide, <b>unburnt</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> and nitrogen oxides, is becoming a world-wide requirement for gasoline fuelled engines (1, 2). First stan-dards were introduced in the U. S. A. and Japan during the early 1970 s (3). Similar standards will be enforced in Europe beginning in 1992 / 93 (4, 5). Diesel engine exhaust poses an additional challenge for emission control because, as compared to exhaust from gasoline engines, it also contains particulate matter. Ear-ly attempts at particulate control utilised catalytic trap oxidisers to filter the exhaust and oxidise the particulates (6 - 8). Catalytic trap ox-idisers have the disadvantage of requiring an active regeneration mechanism to remove particulate build-up. Recent advances in diesel engine technology have greatly reduced the for-mation of particulates, with the result that air quality standards may now be met by the use of catalysed flow-through monoliths (9 - 1 1). These catalysts have the advantage of being passive systems which do not require regeneration. Catalysts for diesel engines must function dif-ferently to those for gasoline engines because of differences in the chemical composition of the exhaust gas. Modern spark-ignition gasoline powered automobiles, with emission control devices, operate near stoichiometry (at an airfuel ratio of- 14. 7 : 1) and under closed-loop electronic control.

The blended fuels were tested for their energy efficiencies and pollutant emissions using SI (spark-ignition) engine with single-cylinder and 4 -stroke. Experimental results showed that the AC 3 (3 vol. % acetone[*]+[*] 97 vol. % gasoline) blended fuel has an advantage over the neat gasoline in exhaust gases temperature, in-cylinder pressure, brake power, torque and volumetric efficiency by about 0. 8 %, 2. 3 %, 1. 3 %, 0. 45 % and 0. 9 %, respectively. As the acetone content increases in the blends, as the engine performance improved where the best performance obtained in this study at the blended fuel of AC 10. In particular, exhaust gases temperature, in-cylinder pressure, brake power, torque and volumetric efficiency increase by about 5 %, 10. 5 %, 5. 2 %, 2. 1 % and 3. 2 %, respectively, compared to neat gasoline. In addition, the use of acetone with gasoline fuel reduces exhaust emissions averagely by about 43 % for carbon monoxide, 32 % for carbon dioxide and 33 % for the <b>unburnt</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> The enhanced engine performance and pollutant emissions are attributed to the higher oxygen content, slight leaning effect, lower knock tendency and high flame speeds of acetone, compared to the neat gasoline.
