50|$|An {{immunosensor}} utilizes {{the very}} specific binding affinity of antibodies {{for a specific}} compound or antigen. The specific nature of the antibody-antigen interaction is analogous to a lock and key fit in that the antigen will only bind to the antibody if it has the correct conformation. Binding events result in a physicochemical change that in combination with a tracer, such as a fluorescent molecules, enzymes, or radioisotopes, can generate a signal. There are limitations with using antibodies in sensors: 1.The antibody binding capacity {{is strongly dependent on}} assay conditions (e.g. pH and temperature) and 2. The antibody-antigen interaction is generally irreversible.

This system is used in a laboratory of experimental hyperthermia to characterize the distribution of temperature on a substitute material of biological tissue (phantom), when it is subjected to controlled electromagnetic or <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>radiations.</b> The experiments are carried out inside an anechoic chamber.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{ultrasonic}} wave assisted asphaltene flocculation/deposition inhibition was earlier introduced by Najafi et al., (2011). Current study {{is based on}} a series of experimental analyses, rheological changes, flocculation behavior, and total asphaltene content of two types of crude oils. The role of <b>ultrasonic</b> wave <b>radiation</b> on these parameters are investigated in order to elaborate the changes in the kinetics of asphaltene flocculation which leads to inhibition of asphaltene flocs formation. Based on the results obtained from the experiments, one can conclude that <b>ultrasonic</b> wave <b>radiation</b> can be most effective if the wave is radiated up to an optimum time. Around this time the oil has its local minimum value of kinematic viscosity, the least value of asphaltene content, and least potential for formation of macro-structured flocsdue to reduction of aromatic to saturate ratio. More detailed studiesrevealed that during radiation timetwo main mechanisms are active in asphaltenic crude oil: asphaltene particles disintegration and formation of asphaltene particles. Based on asphaltene content analysis, the optimum radiation time can be defined as the time at which the two mechanisms have an equal rate. The optimum radiation times are observed {{to be in the same}} time range in different tests.

30|$|Because {{inorganic}} scales reduce permeability near wellbores, {{they cause}} an additional {{pressure drop in}} this region (skin damage) and reduce production. NaCl precipitation, particularly in gas-producing wells, {{is one of the}} formation damage problems which impair the permeability. The use of backwashing water not only requires a large quantity of water, but is also inefficient. This study examined the effect of the ultrasonic waves in NaCl scale removal. Twenty core samples with different permeabilities were saturated with NaCl. After precipitation of NaCl within the cores, the samples were first subjected to water injection and then to water injection with <b>ultrasonic</b> wave <b>radiation.</b> At each stage, the permeability of cores was measured and recorded. Experimental results reveal that applying ultrasonic waves restores the permeability of cores more than water injection alone. In samples with permeability lower than 20, 30 – 100, 100 – 700  md and cores with permeabilities higher than 1000  md, ultrasonic waves recover permeability to 80, 42, 87 and 81 %, respectively. In contrast, water injection alone improves permeability to 29, 18.5, 62 and 77 %, respectively. The effect of these waves is much more obvious than water injection alone in low-permeability cores. SEM images from cores show that ultrasonic waves destroy the structure of deposits of sodium chloride. This phenomenon is due to propagation of these waves and the resulting temperature increase in the surroundings, which leads to the increased solubility of these scales. After exposure to ultrasonic waves, sodium chloride deposits inside the induced fractures of cores could be removed from the fracture, whereas water injection alone could not wash and remove the deposits from the fracture. According to the results of this paper, ultrasonic waves {{can be used as a}} novel and efficient technology in gas wells to remove inorganic scales in the near-wellbore region.|$|R

Objective. The aim of {{the paper is the}} experimental determination of the remote control heat transfer advantages in production line bioreactors using ultrasonic beam compared to contact methods. Methods. An experimental study of the heat and mass transfer process in a bioreactor on the stand with UZP- 6 - 1 immersion unit of the <b>ultrasonic</b> radiator with <b>radiation</b> frequency 42 kHz is carried out. Results. Sound waves emitted into a liquid form a concentration zone of passable sound energy in the confocal vessel form of a cylindrical surface and force the liquid to move along the inner surface of the glass along the ascending cylindrical spiral, forming a motive flow throughout the volume, causing peripheral layers of liquid and bottom layers to move in a horizontal and vertical planes, without leaving stagnant zones. The closer to the coincidence angle is the directed ultrasonic beam the greater is the effectiveness of the driving flow. Conclusions.

40|$|Ultrasonic {{speed of}} {{propagation}} and attenuation were investigated {{as a function}} of absorbed radiation dose in PAG and MAGIC polymer gel dosimeters. Both PAG and MAGIC gel dosimeters displayed a dependence of ultrasonic parameters on absorbed dose with attenuation displaying significant changes in the dose range investigated. The ultrasonic attenuation dose sensitivity at 4 MHz in MAGIC gels was determined to be 4. 7 +/- 0. 3 dB m(- 1) Gy(- 1) and for PAG 3. 9 +/- 0. 3 dB m(- 1) Gy(- 1). Ultrasonic speed dose sensitivities were 0. 178 +/- 0. 006 m s(- 1) Gy(- 1) for MAGIC gel and - 0. 44 +/- 0. 02 m s(- 1) Gy(- 1) for PAG. Density and compressional elastic modulus were investigated to explain the different sensitivities of <b>ultrasonic</b> speed to <b>radiation</b> for PAG and MAGIC gels. The different sensitivities were found to be due to differences in the compressional elastic modulus {{as a function of}} dose for the two formulations. To understand the physical phenomena underlying the increase in ultrasonic attenuation with dose, the viscoelastic properties of the gels were studied. Results suggest that at ultrasonic frequencies, attenuation in polymer gel dosimeters is primarily due to volume viscosity. It is concluded that ultrasonic attenuation significantly increases with absorbed dose. Also, the ultrasonic speed in polymer gel dosimeters is affected by changes in dosimeter elastic modulus that are likely to be a result of polymerization.

40|$|Flue {{gas from}} {{combustion}} or syngas from gasification can contain fine particles, so called aerosols. These can be potentially harmful for downstream equipment or if emitted to the atmosphere, be inhaled by humans and cause respiratory problems. Standard practice to mitigate {{this is to}} use a cyclone which has a low filtration efficiency for sub-micron sized particles. In the 1920 s it has been accidentally discovered that acoustic waves can coagulate aerosols to form bigger sized agglomerates. It has been suggested to use acoustic waves as a pre-treatment step before using a cyclone to increase the filtration efficiency without inducing a pressure or temperature drop on the flow. A study was done on the possible mechanisms for this coagulation and these are used in a population model based on Smoluchowski’s equation. The first mechanism is the orthokinetic particle interaction, which describes a relative velocity of two particles with different entrainment in relation to the velocity field of the acoustic wave. The second mechanism is the acoustic wake effect, an effect in which the distance between particles decreases due to the mutual slipstreaming in an oscillating flow. To verify if the correct physical relations are identified a lab scale setup was built. An of the shelf piezo-electric transducer intended for under water cleaning was taken apart and put into a FEM model. This model was validated with the use of various measurement methods and concluded was that the FEM model is a good tool to predict the mode shapes and Eigen frequencies, but unable to predict the magnitude of the vibration. The model was extended with the design of an <b>ultrasonic</b> horn and <b>radiation</b> plate. With these build, sound pressure levels of over 150 dB at 41 kHz were achieved which are a significant improvement of the transducer without the horn and plate. Three different experiment series were performed with aerosols of different composition, concentration and particle size. In the first series an aerosol was created by atomizing paraffin oil, which created a visible fog. The treatment of this with an acoustic field resulted in an increase of particle deposition in the coagulation chamber. In the second experiment series, the aerosol was formed by atomizing a brine solution to form NaCl crystals. The particles coagulated and a shift in the particle size distribution was measured in accordance with the model. The overall coagulation rate is still an uncertainty because of the inability to properly the measure the intensity of the acoustic field inside the chamber. A final experiment was done with brine atomization, but with helium as a carrier gas which has a lower density than air. As a result the flow rate of the atomizer has to be increased which resulted in a decrease of residence time. Coagulation was measured, but not entirely according to the model predictions. Concluded was that the model which is based on the orthokinetic particle interaction and the acoustic wake effect is able to predict the coagulation, but in some circumstances it appears that an effect is missing from the model.
