The receiver has four pixels arranged in a dual-beam and dual polarized configuration. Orthogonal polarizations are combined in waveguide-based orthomode transducers. Beam-switching at 1 kHz on the sky is achieved using a fast Faraday rotation polarization switch and a wire-grid to interchange the reflected and transmitted beams to each receiver. This <b>ultra-wide-band</b> receiver typically achieves noise temperatures < 50K between 75-110 GHz. The Redshift Search Receiver has exceptional baseline stability {{because it does not}} involve mechanical moving parts, therefore being well-suited to the detection of redshifted transitions of the CO ladder from star-forming galaxies at cosmological distances. An innovative wide-band analog autocorrelator system which covers the full 38 GHz with 31 MHz (100 km/s at 90 GHz) resolution serves as the backed spectrometer.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Orthogonal {{frequency-division}} multiplexing (OFDM) -based <b>ultra-wide-band</b> (UWB) transceivers hold {{the promise to}} revolutionize {{the next generation of}} short-range wireless networks and to be adopted in electronics products for both civil and military applications. For the UWB transceivers to coexist with nearby devices, it is necessary to design efficient UWB receivers whose operation is robust to narrowband interferences (NBI). This paper conducts an in-depth analysis to establish the impacts of NBI on the performance of an OFDM-UWB receiver. A comprehensive study to assess the effects of NBI on the quantization noise in the analog-to-digital converter (ADC), timing, and carrier acquisition is presented. The analytical results show that the efficiency of the ADC is degraded by NBI, although this problem could be slightly remedied by an adaptive autogain controller (AGC). It is also found that, compared with the conventional autocorrelation-based acquisition scheme, the pseudonoise (PN) sequence matched-filtering-based acquisition scheme presents higher robustness to NBI. Nevertheless, both these two acquisition schemes fail at high interference levels. As a conclusion, it is critical to develop novel and low-complexity NBI mitigation schemes for OFDM-UWB receivers that take into account the impacts introduced by NBI.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} mobile robot localization using <b>Ultra-Wide-Band</b> (UWB) range measurements. UWB is a radio technology widely used for communications that recently is receiving increasing attention also for positioning applications. In these cases, {{the position of a}} mobile transceiver is determined from the distances to a set of fixed, well-localized beacons. Though this is a well-known problem in the scientific literature (the trilateration problem), the peculiarities of UWB range measurements (basically, distance errors and multipath effects) demand a different treatment to other similar solutions as for example those based on laser. This work presents a thorough experimental characterization of UWB ranges within a variety of environments and situations. From these experiments we derive a probabilistic model which is then used by a particle filter to combine different readings from UWB beacons as well as the vehicle odometry. To account for the possible offset error due to multipath effects, the state tracked by the particle filter includes the offset of each beacon in addition to the planar robot pose (x, y,φ), both estimated sequentially. We show navigation results for a robot moving in indoor scenarios covered by three UWB beacons that validate our proposal.
