Now, since acl[o]≠acl[o]′ (both represent different nodes in the hierarchy), resource o will be now encrypted {{with the key}} K_[acl[o]^'] corresponding to acl[o]′. To avoid storing multiple copies of the resource encrypted with different keys (K_[acl[o]^'] and K[acl[o]]) for security reasons, data owner must delete the old copy from the server. Since granting <b>read</b> <b>access</b> is a frequent operation, associated re-encryption operation to the outsourced resource by the data owner should be avoided, if possible.|$|R

30|$|Key {{management}} {{is an essential}} component of a cryptographic access control system with a large number of resources. It manages the secret keys assigned to the system entities {{in such a way that}} only authorized users can <b>access</b> a resource. <b>Read</b> <b>access</b> control allows <b>read</b> <b>access</b> of a resource by the authorized users and disallows others. An important objective of a key {{management is}} to reduce the secret key storage with each authorized user. To this end, there exist two prominent types of key management hierarchy with single key storage per user used for <b>read</b> <b>access</b> control in data outsourcing scenario: user-based and resource-based. In this work, we analyze the two types of hierarchy with respect to static hierarchy characteristics and dynamic operations such as adding or revoking user authorization. Our analysis shows that the resource-based hierarchies can be a better candidate which is not given equal emphasis in the literature. A new heuristic for minimizing the key management hierarchy is introduced that makes it practical in use even for a large number of users and resources. The performance evaluation of dynamic operations such as adding or revoking a user’s read subscription is shown experimentally to support our analytical results.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Soft {{errors are}} a major {{reliability}} concern for today’s nanometer technologies. The errors in register files in Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC) can quickly spread to {{various parts of the}} system and result in data corruption which may go unnoticed. Single Error Correction (SEC) Hamming code and Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) provide a high-level mitigation solution for soft errors. The experimental results presented in this work for a 64 -bit wide, 32 -word entry register file, synthesized for IBM Cu- 08 (90 nm) standard cell ASIC technology, show that TMR is a better solution for latency sensitive ASIC applications. This technique increases the <b>read</b> <b>access</b> time by only 17 % but incurs 204 % area penalty. Whereas SEC applied on the 64 -bit word size incurs 129 % increase in <b>read</b> <b>access</b> time with area penalty only about 22 %. This large <b>read</b> <b>access</b> penalty for applying SEC on wide words makes it necessary to partition the word into smaller block sizes before applying SEC. The design space explored in this work, for various combinations of word and block sizes, shows that Hamming code provides a reasonable spectrum of choice to trade-off between area and latency of fault-tolerant register files.
