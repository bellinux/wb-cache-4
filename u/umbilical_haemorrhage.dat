40|$|A 59 -year-old woman {{known to}} have micronodular {{cirrhosis}} presented with haemorrhage from the umbilicus. She eventually required exomphalectomy at which a huge patent umbilical vein was found and ligated. Selective coeliac and superior mesenteric angiography with late phase films confirmed a large umbilical vein filling from the left branch of the portal vein. So far as the author knows, <b>umbilical</b> <b>haemorrhage</b> as a complication of cirrhosis has never previously been reported...|$|E
40|$|A new {{observation}} of inherited factor XIII deficiency is described. The patient had {{presented in the}} past with an <b>umbilical</b> <b>haemorrhage,</b> a cerebral haemorrhage, multiple haematomas with delayed onset after minimal trauma, and episodes of spontaneous haemarthrosis. The biological diagnosis was made {{at the age of}} 7 years. The child had undetectable transamidating activity and factor XIII a chains, while the level of b chains was reduced. The values observed in the parents were intermediate between those of the patient and those of normal plasma. Heated factor VIII concentrates were found to contain only low amounts of factor XIII, and were thus unsuitable for the prophylactic therapy of this rare disease. The patient was successfully treated with monthly injections of a factor XIII concentrate. Case ReportsJournal Articleinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Summary. Parturition was {{observed}} in four of six pregnant red deer hinds, housed indoors. In two normal calvings, labour took 37 and 42 min from {{the appearance of the}} amniotic sac to the birth of the calf: labour was prolonged in one hind after disturbance, and two hinds had calving difficulties. The calves stood 30 to 58 min and sucked 43 to 129 min after birth. Maternal behaviour is described. The incidence of perinatal mortality in wild deer is discussed. Wild red deer in Scotland rut in October and produce their single calves in June. Jones (1966) and Bubenik (1965) have described the birth of four calves. The present paper describes parturition and maternal behaviour in captive hinds kept indoors. The hinds were kept individually, or with their calves, in unheated indoor pens 3 - 7 1 Â· 3 m in size. Details of the six hinds used are given by Arman, Kay, Goodall & Sharman (1974). They were fed on dried grass plus a concentrate mixture, Hind 10 being given restricted amounts of food. The signs of impending parturition were variable and sometimes slight and difficult to detect. There was often a depression in appetite or a filling-out of the udder, a swelling of the vulva or restlessness before calving. The observations on parturition are summarized in Table 1. All hinds except Hind 10 were sufficiently tame to be undisturbed by the observer. Hind 10 showed a pause in labour after disturbance. The timings for the normal, rapid calvings of Hinds 5, 6, 8 and 11 may have been even shorter than those given in Table 1. The amniotic fluid, membranes and placenta were immediately licked up or eaten. In Hind 10, after the pause in labour and posterior presentation, the placenta did not detach and the uterus everted. This condition was successfully treated and she recovered well, although she gave little milk during the first day. Hind 12 also had a posterior presentation, with one hind foot of the calf caught back. The calving was assisted, but the calf died of an <b>umbilical</b> <b>haemorrhage</b> into the uterus...|$|E
40|$|Generalised purpura is {{rare and}} of the many {{possible}} causes, perhaps the most common is thrombocytopenia associated with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (I. T. P.) in the mother. One such case is presented in this study: The child was born from a 28 -year old primigravida who in 1954, {{at the age of}} twelve years, had undergone splenectomy for I. T. P. On examination the male newborn had generalised purpura and areas of ecchymosis. The treatment provided to the neonate is described. Neonatal thrombocytopenia presents as generalized petechaie, purpuric spots and bleeding from various sites, e. g. melaena, haematuria and <b>umbilical</b> cord <b>haemorrhage.</b> In most cases no treatment is required as the condition is mild and resolves spontaneously. With severe thrombocytopenia, one must treat actively because of the threat of intracranial bleeding. peer-reviewe...|$|R
