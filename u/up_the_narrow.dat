5|$|Fighting paused. Mortier and Gazan {{waited for}} Dupont's arrival while Kutuzov and Miloradovich waited for Strik's and Dokhturov's. Schmitt's column was {{expected}} to be the last to join the fight because it had to march the greatest distance. The timing of the respite12:00 or 14:00varies, depending on whose reports are consulted. Strik arrived first and immediately assaulted Gazan's line with three battalions, pushing the French out of Dürenstein. Caught between two strong forces, Gazan attempted to push his way back through Dürenstein, to reach the river where the flotilla could evacuate his exhausted troops. Withdrawing through the narrow Danube canyon and fighting off the Russian force at their rear, Gazan and his division were trapped when more of Strik's Russians appeared to block their retreat. The narrow defiles hampered the Russians; Strik's men had to march out of the canyons, form ranks and attack in waves. Despite Strik's continuous assault in the next two to three hours, Mortier and Gazan pushed the Russians back <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrow</b> fissure in the hillside. At this point, Dokhturov's column appeared behind the French line and joined the battle. The French were outnumbered more than three to one, assaulted in the front by Miloradovich's column, in the middle by Strik's and in the rear by Dokhturov.|$|E

25|$|Colonel Bendix's 7th New York Volunteer Infantry {{had opened}} fire on Colonel Frederick Townsend's 3rd New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, who were coming <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrow</b> road from the {{direction}} of Hampton to the south. The 3rd New York Infantry was being led down the road by General Peirce and his staff on horseback without an advance guard. Bendix knew that no cavalry was with the Union force and mistook the 3rd New York for a Confederate cavalry regiment. More importantly, the 3rd New York Infantry wore gray uniforms, with white bands on their arms such as had been seen previously on the hats, at least, of Confederates. Bendix, who had not been given the watchword or the instructions on armbands, thought the Confederates were behind his regiment as well as in front and ordered his men to fire upon Townsend's men.|$|E

She arrived off Leyte on 17 October, entering the Gulf the next day, and began two days of shore bombardments {{to prepare for the}} troop landings there. On the night of 24 October, a strong Japanese force consisting of two battleships, one heavy cruiser, and four destroyers headed for Surigao Strait with the apparent intent of raiding shipping in Leyte Gulf. [...] The Japanese force advanced in rough column <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrow</b> strait during darkness, but was met with a large U.S. force of cruisers, destroyers and battleships, including Portland. She and her sisters steamed {{across the top of the}} strait, crossing the T of the Japanese force. The Japanese were first met by PT boats, then in succession by three coordinated destroyer torpedo attacks, and finally by devastating gunfire from American battleships and cruisers disposed across the northern end of the strait. Portland took the [...] under fire, scoring three hits on her at 04:02, striking the compass platform and AA defense center. She continued firing on the Mogami for ten minutes She continued to fire on the stranded Mogami until 05:30, striking several hits, including on the ship's bridge. The Battle of Surigao Strait was a decisive defeat for the Japanese force, with most of its ships being destroyed.|$|E

2500|$|By 1914 the White Pass and Yukon Route railway company's river {{navigation}} subsidiary, the British Yukon Navigation Company (BYN Co.), {{had built}} an effective monopoly on riverboat {{traffic in the}} upper reaches of the Yukon River. As trading and mining activities in Yukon and Alaska grew, bigger and better sternwheelers were built to cope with the increasing traffic on the main river channel. However, in order to connect to many mining camps and trading posts vessels were required to negotiate the still shallower and more tortuous channels of the Yukon's tributaries.

2500|$|Douglas's {{successor}} was Frederick Seymour, {{who came}} to the colony with twenty years of colonial experience in Van Diemen's Land, the British West Indies, and British Honduras. [...] The creation of an assembly and Seymour's appointment in April 1864 signalled a new era for the colony, now out of the shadow of Vancouver Island and free of a governor suspicious of sharing power with elected representatives. [...] Douglas's wagon road project was still underway, presenting huge engineering challenges, as it made its way <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrow</b> Fraser Canyon. [...] Successive loans authorised by Seymour's predecessor, largely for the purpose of completing the road, had put the colony £200,000 in debt; and the Chilcotin War of 1864 cost an additional £18,000 to suppress. [...] Seymour himself made the difficult journey through the Great Canyon of the Homathko and Rainbow Range as a show of force and participation in the hunt for Klatsassin, the Tsilhqot'in war leader, but the armed expedition reached a denouement when Klatsassin surrendered on terms of amnesty in times of war, only to be tried and hanged for murder, as Seymour had not endorsed the terms.|$|E
2500|$|A 1910 {{paper by}} Geiger, The Scattering of the α-Particles by Matter, {{describes}} an experiment {{by which he}} sought to measure how the most probable angle through which an a-particle is deflected varies with the material it passes through, the thickness of said material, and the velocity of the alpha particles. He constructed an airtight glass tube from which the air was pumped out. [...] At one end was a bulb (B) containing [...] "radium emanation" [...] (radon-222). [...] By means of mercury, the radon in B was pumped <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrow</b> glass pipe whose end at A was plugged with mica. [...] At {{the other end of}} the tube was a fluorescent zinc sulfide screen (S). [...] The microscope which he used to count the scintillations on the screen was affixed to a vertical millimeter scale with a vernier, which allowed Geiger to precisely measure where the flashes of light appeared on the screen and thus calculate the particles' angles of deflection. The alpha particles emitted from A was narrowed to a beam by a small circular hole at D. [...] Geiger placed a metal foil in the path of the rays at D and E to observe how the zone of flashes changed. [...] He could also vary the velocity of the alpha particles by placing extra sheets of mica or aluminium at A.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} emigrant route across Wyoming of the Oregon, Mormon and California Trails, after progressing up the Platte River valley, {{went up the}} North Platte River valley through Casper, Wyoming, {{along the}} Sweetwater River and over the Continental Divide at [...] South Pass. The original westward travellers in their ox and mule pulled wagons tried to stick to river valleys to avoid as much road building as possible—gradients and sharp corners were usually of little or no concern to them. The ox and mule pulled wagons were the original off-road vehicles in their day, since {{nearly all of the}} Emigrant Trails went cross country over rough, un-improved trails. The route over South Pass's main advantage for wagons pulled by oxen or mules was a shorter elevation over an [...] "easy" [...] pass to cross and its [...] "easy" [...] connection to nearby river valleys {{on both sides of the}} continental divide for water and grass. The emigrant trails were closed in winter. The North Platte/South Pass route was far less beneficial for a railroad, as it was about [...] longer and much more expensive to construct <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrow,</b> steep and rocky canyons of the North Platte. The route along the North Platte was also further from Denver, Colorado, and went across difficult terrain, while a railroad connection to that City was already being planned for and surveyed.|$|E

The lead vehicle was an M20 armored utility car containing Lieutenant Charles L.

Thomas was wounded when evacuating the vehicle, but stayed to organize the deployment of his anti-tank guns which were to provide a base of fire allowing the infantry and tanks to flank the enemy positions. The 3rd platoon remained in action for four hours, with the gun crews sometimes reduced to two out of ten men. Two of the company's guns were quickly knocked out by German artillery, then a third, but the fourth gun kept firing until it was nearly out of ammunition. A single truck driver, T/5 Robert W. Harris, knowing the remaining gun was running out of ammunition, drove his truck to the rear for a new load and upon his return, disregarded the warning from the TF Commander that it was too dangerous to proceed. Driving to within 25 yards of the gun positions, where the truck became stuck in the mud, he unloaded and uncrated the 3" [...] rounds and began carrying them to the remaining gun. The remaining members of the platoon joined him and made numerous trips carrying the ammunition, all the while under heavy enemy fire.|$|E
2500|$|The British Army also {{continued}} firing CS gas. Local politicians and priests {{who were on}} the streets [...] "complained that every time they got a bad situation cooled down more gas had been plunged in". Slingshots were used to launch heavy CS gas canisters into the area and some went through the roofs of houses. According to the Central Citizens' Defence Committee, even streets where there had been no disorder [...] "received salvo after salvo". The soldiers fired 1,600 canisters and cartridges of CS gas during the operation, which was considered to be excessive in such a small area. Some householders set buckets filled with a mixture of water and vinegar outside their front doors [...] "so that those involved in clashes could wet rags to protect them against the stinging gas". Journalist Peter Taylor described the effect of the CS gas on the densely populated area:The clouds of choking and suffocating gas drifted <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrow</b> alleyways and back streets of the warren that is the Lower Falls. The gas got everywhere, in through windows, under doors and into the residents' eyes, noses, throats and lungs. A soldier later interviewed by Taylor recalled: [...] "The place was still saturated with CS gas. Children were coughing, I remember. I'm talking now about the toddlers, kids of three, four, five. It affected everyone but children especially". There were allegations that some soldiers fired CS gas canisters through the windows of houses while residents were still inside. Hundreds of women and children, along with the sick and elderly, began to leave the area.|$|E
2500|$|Considerable {{progress}} was also made in eastern Tonkin, {{a region that}} had seen little fighting during the Sino-French War and was still almost unexplored by the French. [...] Between 1886 and 1888 capitaine de vaisseau de Beaumont's naval division hunted down the pirates who still infested Along Bay {{and most of the}} Delta coasts and completed the work that Admiral Amédée Courbet had begun in 1884. [...] The wild country between Lang Son and the Guangdong border that the French had been unable to subdue during the war with China was now tamed by the French occupation of Tien Yen, Ha Coi and Mong Cai. [...] A vital preliminary to these operations was the completion of the naval survey of the coast of Tonkin by the naval hydrographer La Porte, who took over the work begun in 1883 by Renaud and Rollet de l'Isle. [...] La Porte's moment of glory came when, {{as a result of this}} survey, he personally guided the French gunboats <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrow</b> river channels to Mong Cai, enabling the French to confront the town's defences with overwhelming strength. [...] Mong Cai was occupied by the French in December 1886. [...] La Porte crowned his career by making a general triangulation of Tonkin, from Haiphong to Hung Hoa and to Phu Lang Thuong, drawing on a series of topographical maps produced since 1883 by military engineering officers. [...] Finally, a column of 600 soldiers and 400 coolies under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Alphonse Dugenne, the hero of the Bac Le ambush in June 1884, marched along the coastal plain of eastern Tonkin as far as the Chinese border and explored the sparsely-populated and mountainous hinterland running back to Lang Son. [...] The French completed their penetration of eastern Tonkin in January 1887 by driving insurgent bands from the Pak Lung peninsula, a border region disputed between Vietnam and China. [...] In July 1887 the peninsula was awarded to China by the Border Delimitation Commission.|$|E
