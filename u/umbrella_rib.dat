5000|$|An umbel is an {{inflorescence}} {{which consists}} {{of a number of}} short flower stalks (called pedicels) which spread from a common point, somewhat like <b>umbrella</b> <b>ribs.</b> The word was coined in botany in the 1590s, from Latin umbella [...] "parasol, sunshade." [...] The arrangement can vary from being flat topped to almost spherical. Umbels can be simple or compound. The secondary umbels of compound umbels are known as umbellules or umbellets. A small umbel is called an umbellule. The arrangement of the inflorescence in umbels is referred to as umbellate, or occasionally subumbellate (almost umbellate).|$|R
50|$|Unlike the {{laborious}} {{and difficult}} woodcutting technique, linocutting was prized for its simple tools and materials, making it economical and particularly appealing to Andrews - {{a woman of}} modest means. Following Flight's process, Andrews used ordinary household linoleum, gouges made from <b>umbrella</b> <b>ribs,</b> and a simple wooden spoon to rub against the paper during printing. The softness of linoleum prevented the cutting of fine lines, resulting in the bold shapes seen in Andrews works. Alternately, Andrews often applied a technique of repetitive hatch-marks {{in order to create}} the impression of texture.|$|R
50|$|She {{turns the}} page, and meets a ballet of <b>umbrella</b> <b>ribs.</b> The <b>umbrella</b> ribs’ song starts playing. She is then strucked by an idea. She phones the blue rabbits, and asks {{them to come}} to the page she is in. They arrive, and she announces them that she has found a way for them not to become red. Indeed they just need to hold the {{umbrellas}} when it is raining {{and they are going to}} protect them (Resumption of the Blue Rabbits’ Gathering Song). In the next page, Emily meets a hedgehog who is sad because nobody wants to stroke him due to his quills. Emily as the “book’s fairy” decides to caress him to make him happy (Hedgehog’s Song).|$|R
2500|$|Dante {{now finds}} himself in the Eighth Circle, called Malebolge ("Evil Ditches"): {{the upper half of}} the Hell of the Fraudulent and Malicious. The Eighth Circle is a large funnel of stone shaped like an amphitheatre around which run a series of ten deep, narrow, {{concentric}} ditches or trenches called bolge (singular: bolgia). Within these ditches are punished those guilty of Simple Fraud. From the foot of the Great Cliff to the Well (which forms the neck of the funnel) are large spurs of rock, like <b>umbrella</b> <b>ribs</b> or spokes, which serve as bridges over the ten ditches. Dorothy L. Sayers writes that the Malebolge is, [...] "the image of the City in corruption: the progressive disintegration of every social relationship, personal and public. Sexuality, ecclesiastical and civil office, language, ownership, counsel, authority, psychic influence, and material interdependence – all the media of the community's interchange are perverted and falsified".|$|R
40|$|Heumgyeonggaknu is a water-hammering type {{automatic}} water clock {{which was}} made by Jang Yeong-Sil in 1438. The water clock that is located in Heumgyeonggaknu consists of Suho which is equipped with 2 -stage overflow. Constant water wheel power is generated by supplying a fixed amount of water of Suho to Sususang, and this power is transferred to each floor at the same time. The 1 st floor rotation wheel of Gasan consists of the operation structure which has the shape of <b>umbrella</b> <b>ribs.</b> The 2 nd floor rotation wheel is made so that the 12 hour signal, Gyeong-Jeom signal, and Jujeon constitute a systematic configuration. The 3 rd floor rotation wheel is made so that the signal and rotation of Ongnyeo and four gods can be accomplished. Based on the above conceptual design, this paper analyzed the internal signal generation and power transmission of Heumgyeonggaknu...|$|R

40|$|Detection and {{tracking}} strategies based on monocular vision are proposed for autonomous aerial refuelling tasks. The drogue {{attached to the}} fuel tanker aircraft has two important features. The grey values of the drogue's inner part {{are different from the}} external <b>umbrella</b> <b>ribs,</b> as shown in the image. The shape of the drogue's inner dark part is nearly circular. According to crucial prior knowledge, the rough and fine positioning algorithms are designed to detect the drogue. Particle filter based on the drogue's shape is proposed to track the drogue. A strategy to switch between detection {{and tracking}} is proposed to improve the robustness of the algorithms. The inner dark part of the drogue is segmented precisely in the detecting and tracking process and the segmented circular part can be used to measure its spatial position. The experimental results show that the proposed method has good performance in real-time and satisfied robustness and positioning accuracy...|$|R
6000|$|It {{was here}} Harvey first met the squid, {{who is one}} of the best cod-baits, but {{uncertain}} in his moods. They were waked out of their bunks one black night by yells of [...] "Squid O!" [...] from Salters, and for an hour and a half every soul aboard hung over his squid-jig--a piece of lead painted red and armed at the lower end with a circle of pins bent backward like half-opened <b>umbrella</b> <b>ribs.</b> The squid--for some unknown reason--likes, and wraps himself round, this thing, and is hauled up ere he can escape from the pins. But as he leaves his home he squirts first water and next ink into his captor's face; and it was curious to see the men weaving their heads from side to side to dodge the shot. They were as black as sweeps when the flurry ended; but a pile of fresh squid lay on the deck, and the large cod thinks very well of a little shiny piece of squid-tentacle at the tip of a clam-baited hook. Next day they caught many fish, and met the Carrie Pitman, to whom they shouted their luck, and she wanted to trade--seven cod for one fair-sized squid; but Disko would not agree at the price, and the Carrie dropped sullenly to leeward and anchored half a mile away, in the hope of striking on to some for herself.|$|R
5000|$|Thomas Wright, in his Domestic Manners of the English, gives {{a drawing}} from the Harleian MS., No. 604, which {{represents}} an Anglo-Saxon gentleman walking out attended by his servant, the servant carrying an umbrella with a handle that slopes backwards, {{so as to}} bring the umbrella {{over the head of}} the person in front. It probably could not be closed, but otherwise it looks like an ordinary <b>umbrella,</b> and the <b>ribs</b> are represented distinctly.|$|R
50|$|Umbrella hats have {{a typical}} <b>umbrella</b> canopy, with <b>ribs</b> {{supporting}} a fabric or plastic covering. This canopy {{is connected to}} a headband via four short shafts on every other rib to keep the canopy over the head. The canopy is generally collapsible, with the ribs and fabric collapsing around the headband shafts, much like a typical umbrella. Umbrella hats can come in {{a wide array of}} colors, and sizes, including national flags like the British Flag.|$|R
50|$|Although {{this design}} stabilizes the dome and the {{surrounding}} walls and arches, the actual construction of the walls of Hagia Sophia weakened the overall structure. The bricklayers used more mortar than brick, weakening the walls. The structure {{would have been more}} stable if the builders at least let the mortar cure before they began the next layer; however, they did not do this. When the dome was erected, its weight caused the walls to lean outward because of the wet mortar underneath. When Isidore the Younger rebuilt the fallen cupola, he had first to build up the interior of the walls to make them vertical again. Additionally, the architect raised the height of the rebuilt dome by approximately 6 m so that the lateral forces would not be as strong and its weight would be transmitted more effectively down into the walls. Moreover, he shaped the new cupola like a scalloped shell or the inside of an <b>umbrella,</b> with <b>ribs</b> that extend from the top down to the base. These ribs allow the weight of the dome to flow between the windows, down the pendentives, and ultimately to the foundation.|$|R
40|$|MMA Design (MMA) has invented and is {{developing}} a revolutionary deployable antenna solution providing extremely high areal compaction for future microsatellite missions. Our solution combines the positive attributes of currently fielded antenna systems and will enable performance for microsatellites consistent with today’s large space craft payloads. The MMA patented and patent pending Deployable High Gain Reflectarray (DaHGR) antenna has both a wideband and a narrower band configuration. The antenna architecture is realized using very lightweight flexible membrane substrates incorporating a hoop structure to deploy the membranes and maintain tension. The proposed solution builds on innovations by MMA in extremely lightweight deployable systems specific to large antennas and aerobraking systems. Current state-of-the-art (SOA) Mesh Antennas use <b>ribbed</b> <b>umbrella</b> and hoop structures for deployment. While these are potentially scalable to some extent, they inherently have high parts count and require significant touch labor at {{a high number of}} attach points to form the desired mesh surface. These systems have constraints on their stowed volume which present challenges with small launch vehicle fairings and dispensers. The DaHGR sets a new standard for deployable antennas with 1 / 3 rd the parts count, less than 1 / 5 th the volume (with a more favorable/flexible aspect ratio), and ó the cost of current SOA deployable antennas. The DaHGR antenna solution combines the best attributes of successfully flown solutions. It offers advantages in performance, compaction, and simplicity and significantly reduces the development and implementation risk by leveraging proven technologies. A large space-fed reflectarray provides equivalent performance as a conventional reflector for all missions not requiring extremely large bandwidth. Bandwidths achievable by reflectarrays easily support a multitude of mission requirements...|$|R
40|$|The {{geometrical}} {{elements in}} the architecture of Lincoln Cathedral, in the vaulting and elevations, {{can be compared to}} the geometries described by Robert Grosseteste in his cosmologies. The architecture can be read as a catechism of the cosmologies. The geometries appear in the cathedral {{for the first time in}} the history of architecture to explain the generation, emanation, reflection, refraction and rarefaction of light as it forms the material world. The proposition is that the geometries of the architecture of Lincoln Cathedral can be understood in relation to the geometries which are the basis of the cosmologies of Robert Grosseteste, Bishop of Lincoln 1235 – 53, in particular De lineis, angulis et figuris (On Lines, Angles and Figures, c. 1235), and De luce (On Light, c. 1215). Many of the architectural forms at Lincoln Cathedral are unprecedented in their appearance or use, and they form the basic vocabulary for the entire development of English Gothic architecture. Their radically new appearance has never been adequately explained. Vocabulary elements such as the ridge pole, tierceron or non-structural rib, lierne or segmented ridge rib, flying rib, conoid springer vault or cone of ribs rising from the springer pole in the elevation, triradial vaulting or three ribs meeting at the ridge pole, double syncopated or overlapping arcading, and the bundled and <b>ribbed</b> <b>umbrella</b> column, all originate in some form or are developed for the first time in Lincoln. All of the geometries which appear for the first time in the architecture appear in the cosmologies of Grosseteste, for the purpose of explaining the generation, emanation, reflection, refraction, and rarefaction of light as it forms the material world in geometrical configurations. The cathedral would thus be a catechism of the geometrical substructure of the physical world, in the tradition of the Timaeus of Plato. There is no evidence that the concepts were dictated by Grosseteste directly to masons, but it is well known that such concepts permeated medieval architecture and city planning, and that they were filtered down through all trades involved in construction of the city and the cathedral. Grosseteste’s cosmologies represent a core achievement of Scholasticism, the synthesis of classical philosophy (cosmology) and Catholic theology (light mysticism), which is embodied in the architecture of the cathedral...|$|R
