5|$|Although Stegosaurus is {{undoubtedly}} now {{considered to have}} been quadrupedal, some discussion has occurred over whether it could have reared up on its hind legs, <b>using</b> <b>its</b> tail to form a tripod with its hind limbs, and browsing for higher foliage. This has been proposed by Bakker and opposed by Carpenter. A study by Mallison (2010) found support a rearing up posture in Kentrosaurus, though not for ability for the tail {{to act as a}} tripod.|$|E

5|$|In 1969, the Dubna team {{carried out}} {{chemical}} experiments on element 102 {{and concluded that}} it behaved as the heavier homologue of ytterbium. The Russian scientists proposed the name joliotium (Jo) for the new element after Irène Joliot-Curie, who had recently died, creating an element naming controversy {{that would not be}} resolved for several decades, which each group <b>using</b> <b>its</b> own proposed names.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, {{the first}} report on {{attempted}} isolation of the element was unsuccessful, prompting new theoretical studies to investigate how best to investigate bohrium (<b>using</b> <b>its</b> lighter homologs technetium and rhenium for comparison) and removing unwanted contaminating elements such as the trivalent actinides, the group 5 elements, and polonium.|$|E
5|$|In September 2011, SpiceJet {{launched}} its regional hub at RGIA, <b>using</b> <b>its</b> new Bombardier Q400 aircraft.

Stunt shots were filmed in October 2012 after footage acquired during the main filming period was found to have errors.|$|E
5|$|Most frogs {{identify}} prey by movement, {{and vision}} {{appears to be}} the primary method by which the cane toad detects prey; however, the cane toad can also locate food <b>using</b> <b>its</b> sense of smell. They eat a wide range of material; in addition to the normal prey of small rodents, reptiles, other amphibians, birds, and even bats and a range of invertebrates, they also eat plants, dog food, and household refuse.|$|E
5|$|Seabirds, {{by virtue}} {{of living in a}} geologically depositional {{environment}} (that is, in the sea where sediments are readily laid down), are well represented in the fossil record. They are first known to occur in the Cretaceous period, the earliest being the Hesperornithiformes, like Hesperornis regalis, a flightless loon-like seabird that could dive in a fashion similar to grebes and loons (<b>using</b> <b>its</b> feet to move underwater) but had a beak filled with sharp teeth.|$|E

5|$|The company's {{sales of}} MIS schemes, and its profits, both peaked in 2006, with over A$450million in sales, and a net {{profit after tax}} of A$133million. However, the 2006 harvest (of 1996 {{plantations}}) yielded a return of only A$1500 and $1750 for the woodlots that investors had bought for A$3000. These plantations had not been productive enough to yield a profit for investors, so Great Southern inflated the returns to A$4100 <b>using</b> <b>its</b> own funds.|$|E

5|$|The greater yellow-headed vulture forages <b>using</b> <b>its</b> keen {{eyesight}} {{to locate}} carrion on the ground, but also uses {{its sense of}} smell, an ability which is uncommon in the avian world.

5|$|The white-breasted {{nuthatch}} forages along {{tree trunks}} and branches {{in a similar}} way to woodpeckers and treecreepers, but does not use its tail for additional support, instead progressing in jerky hops <b>using</b> <b>its</b> strong legs and feet. All nuthatches are distinctive when seeking food because they are able to descend tree trunks head-first and can hang upside-down beneath twigs and branches.|$|E

5|$|Unlike some finch species, the American {{goldfinch}} {{uses its}} feet extensively in feeding. It frequently hangs from seedheads while feeding {{in order to}} reach the seeds more easily. In the spring, the American goldfinch feeds on the catkins hanging from birches and alders by pulling one up with its beak and <b>using</b> <b>its</b> toes to hold the catkin still against the branch. This dexterity enables it to take advantage of food sources relatively inaccessible to potential competitors, increasing its chances of survival.|$|E
5|$|Whereas the {{original}} game introduced the F3600 anti-gravity racing league in 2052, Wipeout 2097 is set over four decades later and introduces the player to the much faster, more competitive, and more dangerous F5000 AG racing league. The game {{introduced a new}} damage interface and new weapons and tracks. The Sega Saturn version supported analogue control by <b>using</b> <b>its</b> 3D Control Pad, whereas the PlayStation version supported analogue control only through using the optional Negcon twist controller.|$|E

The Army had already begun converting the former Thor launchers to Jupiter when an Ad Hoc Panel formed by the Department of Defense considered the issue.
