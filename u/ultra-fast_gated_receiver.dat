Our technique uses two pulsed laser transmitters allowing simultaneous measurement of a C 02 absorption line in the 1570 nm band, 02 extinction in the Oxygen A-band and surface height and backscatter. The lidar measures the energy and time of flight of the laser echoes reflected from the atmosphere and surface. The lasers are stepped in wavelength across the C 02 line and an 02 line region during the measurement. The receiver uses a telescope and photon counting detectors, and measures the background light and energies of the laser echoes from the surface along with scattering from any aerosols in the path.

40|$|This project {{represents}} a step towards the overarching aim of imaging scattering specimens. In such samples, the contrast and sharpness of optical images is se-verely reduced since a large {{fraction of the}} light is scattered and manifests itself as a uniform background. In optical projection tomography it has been demon-strated previously that the scattered background can {{be separated from the}} im-age-forming light by capturing only the first arriving photons with ingenious <b>ultra-fast</b> <b>gated</b> optical set-ups [1 - 3]. The goal of this project is to investigate if the same can be achieved for optical microscopy using a gated camera and a low-cost laser. In addition, this project aims to be to quantitatively stating how much the image quality can be improved using a time gated optical set-up and to enhance a 3 D reconstruction of a biological tissue. In order to accomplish the objectives, several programs and/or experiments which facilitates the everyday work in the lab were developed: like a way to or-chestrate a camera, a laser, and an oscilloscope; testing two super-resolution techniques; and finding way to record data from an oscilloscope. In short, the aforementioned set-ups are based on the same fact: if light is passed through a sample and only the first portion of the photons coming out of it are integrated to form an image, the negative effects of light scattering are reduced. To simplify the notation, I shall only refer to this idea as ‘time -gated’. This idea will be explained in detail, after the concepts of light microscopy and scattering are first introduced in this thesis. After it, the equipment that was used in order to develop the time-gated set-up will be elucidated. These two elements makes up the introduction, the first of the five blocks onto which the text is structured.

The mission's goals are to provide measurements of tropospheric CO 2 abundance with global-coverage, a few hundred km spatial and monthly temporal resolution. These are needed to better understand CO 2 fluxes and the processes that regulate CO 2 storage by the land and oceans. For the lIP, we are developing and demonstrating the lidar techniques and key lidar technology that will permit measurements of the CO 2 column abundance in the lower troposphere from aircraft. Our final goal is to demonstrate the key capabilities needed for a space lidar and mission approach for the ASCENDS mission. We use a pulsed lidar technique, which is much less sensitive to errors from cloud and atmospheric scattering and to noise from solar background. It allows continuous measurements of CO 2 mixing ratio in the lower troposphere during day and night. Our approach uses the 1570 nm CO 2 band and a two-wavelength laser absorption spectrometer, which continuously measures at nadir from a circular polar orbit. It directs the narrow co-aligned laser beams from the instrument's lasers toward nadir, and measures {{the energy of the}} laser echoes reflected from land and water surfaces. It uses a pair of tunable laser transmitters, which allowing measurement of the extinction from a single selected CO 2 absorption line in the 1570 nm band and from a line pair in the Oxygen A-band near 765 nm. These regions have temperature insensitive absorption lines are free from interference from other gases. The lasers pulse at 10 KHz, use tunable diode seed lasers followed by laser amplifiers, and have MHz spectral widths. During the measurement the lasers are stepped across the selected lines at a kHz rate. The receiver uses a 1 -m class telescope and photon sensitive detectors and measures the background light and energies of the laser echoes from the surface. The extinction and column densities for the CO 2 and O 2 gases are estimated from the ratio of the on and off line echo pulse energies via the integrated path differential absorption (IPDA) technique.

40|$|The {{impact of}} power supply {{integrity}} on a design {{has become a}} critical issue, not only for functional verification, but also for performance verification.

We then formulate the path delay maximization problem as a constrained linear optimization problem, considering the effect of both IR drop and LdI/dt drops. We show how correlations between currents of different circuit blocks can be incorporated in this formulation using linear constraints.

40|$|Measurements of tropospheric CO 2 {{abundance}} with global-coverage, a {{few hundred}} km spatial and monthly temporal resolution are needed to quantify processes that regulate CO 2 storage by the land and oceans. The Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO) is the first space mission focused on atmospheric CO 2 for measuring total column CO, and O 2 by detecting the spectral absorption in reflected sunlight. The OCO mission is an essential step, and will yield important new information about atmospheric CO 2 distributions. However there are unavoidable limitations imposed by its measurement approach. These include best accuracy only during daytime at moderate to high sun angles, interference by cloud and aerosol scattering, and limited signal from CO 2 variability in the lower tropospheric CO 2 column. We have been developing a new laser-based technique for the remote measurement of the tropospheric CO 2 concentrations from orbit. Our initial goal is to demonstrate a lidar technique and instrument technology that will permit measurements of the CO 2 column abundance in the lower troposphere from aircraft. Our final goal {{is to develop a}} space instrument and mission approach for active measurements of the CO 2 mixing ratio at the 1 - 2 ppmv level. Our technique is much less sensitive to cloud and atmospheric scattering conditions and would allow continuous measurements of CO 2 mixing ratio in the lower troposphere from orbit over land and ocean surfaces during day and night. Our approach is to use the 1570 nm CO 2 band and a 3 -channel laser absorption spectrometer (i. e. lidar used an altimeter mode), which continuously measures at nadir from a near polar circular orbit. The approach directs the narrow co-aligned laser beams from the instrument's lasers toward nadir, and measures the energy of the laser echoes reflected from land and water surfaces. It uses several tunable fiber laser transmitters which allowing measurement of the extinction from a single selected CO 2 absorption line in the 1570 nm band. This band is free from interference from other gases and has temperature insensitive absorption lines. During the measurement the lasers are tuned on- and off- a selected CO 2 line near 1572 nm and a selected O 2 line near 768 nm in the Oxygen A band at kHz rates. The lasers use tunable diode seed lasers followed by fiber amplifiers, and have spectral widths much narrower than the gas absorption lines. The receiver uses a 1 -m diameter telescope and photon counting detectors and measures the background light and energies of the laser echoes from the surface. The extinction and column densities for the CO 2 and O 2 gases are estimated from the ratio of the on and offline surface echo via the differential optical absorption technique. Our technique rapidly alternates between several on-line wavelengths set to the sides of the selected gas absorption lines. It exploits the atmospheric pressure broadening of the lines to weight the measurement sensitivity to the atmospheric column below 5 km. This maximizes sensitivity to CO 2 in the boundary layer, where variations caused by surface sources and sinks are largest. Simultaneous measurements of O 2 column will use an identical approach with an O 2 line. Thee laser frequencies are tunable and have narrow (MHz) line widths. In combination with sensitive photon counting detectors these enables much higher spectral resolution and precision than is possible with passive spectrometer. 1 aser backscatter profiles are also measured, which permits identifying measurements made to cloud tops and through aerosol layers. The measurement approach using lasers in common-nadir-zenith path allows retrieving CO 2 column mixing ratios in the lower troposphere irrespective of sun angle.

Their distinctive advantages, compared to the silicon (Si) counterparts, can aid in achieving low cost, reliable and efficient power management of energy generation systems. In this thesis, the switching performance of different Si and SiC power semiconductors is evaluated and the measured power loss components is compared in a 1. 2 kW DC-DC converter. Thermal performance evaluation of power semiconductors is also compared using: (i) various switching frequencies up to 300 kHz, in steps of 25 kHz; (ii) case temperatures from 25 to 150 °C; and (iii) natural convection heatsinks with temperature increase rate of 0. 5 °C/W. The results demonstrate an opportunity to design power electronic (PE) systems with enhanced reliability and less effort required for thermal management. Also, an <b>ultra-fast</b> SiC MOSFET <b>gate</b> driver, which uses eGaN technology to realise MHz range switching capability is proposed. Using this gate driver, the operational performance of a SiC MOSFET for a 600 W non-isolated DC-DC boost converter at 2 MHz is experimentally analysed, and the maximum achievable switching frequency with this gate driver is determined. The effects of switching speeds on electromagnetic interference (EMI) generation from all-SiC and SiC-Si device combinations are investigated in a two-stage cascaded boost converter. A common mode (CM) EMI model for the converter is derived to identify noise sources. It is revealed that CM EMI emissions are independent of the device switching time when operated in the low-frequency range, while there is some dependence in the high-frequency range. Lastly, {{the performance of the}} SiC MOSFET device in a five-level flying capacitor (FC) converter is explored. Loss analysis is performed based on a calculation model, which verifies the correspondence between measurement and simulation results. In particular, the volume of the FC converter, and the passive components in the filter, are significantly reduced. This reduction is achieved by elevating the operating frequency for each controllable power switch based on self-balancing properties of the FC converter with phase shifted-PWM control. All theoretical considerations are supported by analysis, simulation and laboratory experimental results taken from low-power hardware prototypes...|$|R
