5|$|Back in Tokyo after Shishio's defeat, Yahiko notices Yukishiro Enishi's revenge {{plot against}} Kenshin. Sensing his own {{inability}} to help, he trains {{much harder to}} learn the two succession techniques in Kamiya Kasshin-ryū. Such moves allow him to block an opponent's attack and then hit him with his weapon. He successfully learns both of this techniques and becomes so adept at using them, that Yahiko starts performing several variations. He uses these moves against one of Enishi's partners Otowa Hyōko and defeats him. While Yahiko rests from to his injuries, Kaoru is kidnapped by Enishi, and Yahiko and his friends start searching for her. When another of Enishi's comrades, Kujiranami Hyōgo escapes from jail and goes on a rampage, Yahiko stands <b>up</b> <b>against</b> <b>him.</b> However, he is not strong enough on his own to defeat him and Kenshin saves him at the last moment. After he and Kenshin recover from their fight injuries, they go to rescue Kaoru from Enishi. While on his island fortress, Yahiko defeats {{one of the four}} bodyguards from Enishi's partner, Heishin, and witnesses Kenshin's fight against Enishi, which Kenshin wins. Five years later, he is the acting instructor at the Kamiya Kasshin-ryū dojo. One day Kenshin calls him to test his skills; when he lands a hit on Kenshin, he gives Yahiko his own reverse-blade sword as a sign that he has become a true samurai.|$|E

However, it appears {{that she did not}} buy all of the arsenic which killed her patients. The doctor and some of the patients had signed off to purchase it. The investigation pursued Dr. King because more evidence was piling <b>up</b> <b>against</b> <b>him,</b> but suspicions were focused back on Amy when someone suggested to clearly check all records of arsenic purchases.|$|E
25|$|In addition, had Uthman {{changed the}} Quran, {{it would have}} served as the clearest {{argument}} for, and major justification of, his public assassination. His opponents would have brought this <b>up</b> <b>against</b> <b>him,</b> {{but there are no}} records of this. Al-Khoei also argues that if Uthman had altered the Quran, Ali would have restored it to its original state upon the death of Uthman, especially if verses of his rule had been removed. Instead Ali is seen promoting the Quran during his reign, which is evidence that there was no alteration.|$|E

25|$|Dissatisfied {{with the}} emperor, who had ceased his policy of grants and family alliances {{in favour of}} paying Magyar mercenaries, several Italian nobles — led by Adalbert {{and many of the}} bishops — invited Rudolph II of Upper Burgundy to take the Italian throne in 921. Moreover, his own grandson, Berengar of Ivrea, rose <b>up</b> <b>against</b> <b>him,</b> incited by Rudolph. Berengar retreated to Verona and had to watch sidelined as the Magyars pillaged the country. John, Bishop of Pavia, {{surrendered}} his city to Rudolph in 922 and it was sacked by the Magyars in 924. On 29 July 923, the forces of Rudolph, Adalbert, and Berengar of Ivrea met those of Berengar and defeated him in the Battle of Fiorenzuola, near Piacenza. The battle was decisive and Berengar was de facto dethroned and replaced by Rudolf. Berengar was soon after murdered at Verona by one of his own men, possibly at Rudolph's instigation. He left no sons, only a daughter (the aforementioned Bertha) and an anonymous epic poem, the Gesta Berengarii Imperatoris, about the many happenings of his troublesome reign.|$|E
25|$|On 27 May the British {{commander}} in Quetta decided {{to attack the}} Afghan fortress at Spin Baldak, capturing it (the last time the British Army used an escalade) and, in the process, seized the initiative in the south; however, {{the situation in the}} centre of the war zone, around Kurram, remained desperate for the British. The Afghan forces in this area were under the command of General Nadir Khan and he possessed a force of some 14 battalions. Against this, the British at Thal, under Brigadier General Alexander Eustace, possessed only four battalions. To make matters worse, the only troops protecting the upper Tochi Valley were the disaffected North Waziristan Militia. Concerned that they would rise <b>up</b> <b>against</b> <b>him</b> if left to their own devices, Eustace gave the order to abandon the militia outposts but in doing so precipitated the desertion of many of the militiamen. This disaffection spread and the South Waziristan Militia in Wana turned on their officers and any men who had remained loyal and attacked them. The survivors, under Major Russell, the commandant, were forced to fight their way out to a column of the North Zhob Militia which had been sent out to relieve them.|$|E
500|$|Manuel I Komnenos died on 24 September 1180. Bohemond soon repudiated his wife, Theodora, {{to marry}} an Antiochene lady of bad reputation, Sybil. Ali ibn al-Athir {{described}} Sybil {{as a spy}} who was [...] "in correspondence with Saladin and exchanged gifts with him". Patriarch Aimery accused Bohemond of adultery and excommunicated him. After Bohemond confiscated church property, Aimery imposed an interdict on Antioch and fled to his fortress at Qosair. Bohemond besieged the fortress, but Reynald Masoir, Lord of Margat, and other noblemen who supported the patriarch rose <b>up</b> <b>against</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

500|$|Rather than {{publish the}} results, Noriega voided the election, {{claiming}} [...] "foreign interference" [...] had tainted the results, and declared Duque, his chosen candidate, {{to be the}} winner. Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, present in Panama as an observer, denounced Noriega, saying the election had been [...] "stolen", as did Bishop Marcos G. McGrath. However, Duque knew he had been badly defeated and refused to go along. The next day, Endara, Arias Calderón, and Ford rolled through the old part of the capital in a triumphant motorcade, only to be intercepted by a detachment of Noriega's paramilitary Dignity Battalions. Arias Calderón was protected {{by a couple of}} troops, but Endara and Ford were badly beaten. Images of Ford running to safety with his guayabera shirt covered in blood were broadcast around the world. When the 1984–89 presidential term expired, Noriega named a longtime associate, Francisco Rodríguez, as acting president. The U.S. recognized Endara as the new president. Noriega's decision to void the election results led to another coup attempt against him in October 1989. A number of Noriega's junior officers rose <b>up</b> <b>against</b> <b>him,</b> but the rebellion was easily crushed by the members of the Defense Forces loyal to Noriega. After this attempt, he declared himself the [...] "maximum leader" [...] of the country. The rebels were captured and taken to a military base outside Panama City, where they were tortured and then executed.|$|E

Henderson-Stewart increased his majority while the Liberal lost his deposit.

On June 27, 1941, five days after the German–Romanian attack on the Soviet Union, Cecan was secretly shot by the NKVD in Kishinev prison. His fate was the subject of confusion in Romania: while some simply noted that he had gone missing, others acknowledged that [...] "somewhere in Bessarabia, under a simple cross", he was [...] "awaiting his resurrection". In August 1941, news of his killing were featured in Universul daily.|$|E
2500|$|In Jewish rabbinic literature, {{especially}} the aggadah, Jeremiah and Moses are often mentioned together; {{their life and}} works being presented in parallel lines.

[...] And Rabbi Judan {{connected}} Sheba, , with shevuah, , which means [...] "oath," [...] as in the oath that [...] reports Abraham and Abimelech swore to each other.) Rabbi Judan taught that Jacob reasoned {{that he did not want}} Abimelech to demand that Jacob swear to Abimelech (a commitment of nonaggression) as Jacob's grandfather Abraham swore to him, and so delay Jacob's descendants from entering the Land of Israel for seven generations. (As a result of Abraham's oath to Abimelech, seven generations – from Abraham to Joshua – passed before the Israelites entered the Land of Israel. Thus to avoid another seven generations of delay, Jacob went [...] "out of the well of the oath" [...] to evade a further commitment of nonaggression.) Rav Huna taught that the words of [...] mean [...] "out of the well of the birthright." [...] Rav Huna taught that Jacob reasoned that he did not wish to allow Esau to rise <b>up</b> <b>against</b> <b>him</b> and assert that Jacob had cheated him by taking his birthright, and thus lose the advantage of Esau's oath (when Esau conveyed his birthright in [...] ).

2500|$|During {{production}} of UFO, Gerry Anderson was approached directly by Harry Saltzman (at the time co-producer of the James Bond film series with Albert [...] "Cubby" [...] Broccoli), and {{was invited to}} write and produce the next film in the series, {{which was to be}} Moonraker. Collaborating with Tony Barwick to provide the characterisation, whilst he himself focused on the action sequences, Anderson wrote and delivered a treatment to Saltzman. Nothing ultimately came of it, and Broccoli and Saltzman proceeded to make Diamonds Are Forever (1971) and Live and Let Die (1973) and, after co-producing 1974's Bond film, The Man with the Golden Gun, the Saltzman-Broccoli partnership dissolved. Offered £20,000 for the treatment, Anderson refused, fearing that if he accepted he would not be at the helm when it was made; the next Bond film to be made was 1977's The Spy Who Loved Me. (This film used only the title of the actual Ian Fleming novel.) Anderson started legal proceedings against Broccoli for plagiarism of story elements but withdrew the action shortly after, nervous of the legal might lined <b>up</b> <b>against</b> <b>him.</b> He relinquished the treatment, and received £3,000 in compensation. A film version of Moonraker was eventually produced in 1979, but did not involve any of Anderson's material.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the long}} years of warfare under Tsar Simeon I the Great (893-927), the country was exhausted. The {{constant}} wars were unpopular enough so that 20,000 people sought refuge in Byzantium because of Simeon's [...] "warlike rush and relentless intentions". His successor Peter I concluded a favourable peace treaty with the Byzantines, but the situation inside the country saw no improvement. There were many reasons for the decline— some historians dismiss Peter I as a weak ruler, incapable of handling his own family (two of his brothers rose <b>up</b> <b>against</b> <b>him).</b> Furthermore, in the mid-10th century the new Bogomil heresy spread itself widely over the country. The Bogomils preached that people must not follow secular authorities, pay taxes or enroll in the army. As a result, the Bulgarians were unable to stop the Magyars, who looted and plundered the countryside, further contributing to the grim situation of the state. When the Byzantines paid the Rus' knyaz Svyatoslav I to invade Bulgaria in 968, Peter I could send only 30,000 men against the 60,000 strong invading force. During the Rus' invasion between 968 and 971 the Bulgarians de facto {{lost control of the}} north-eastern parts of their country, including the capital Preslav, and in 970, Svyatoslav massacred 300 Bulgarian nobles, the elite of the Bulgarian nation and army, in Silistra.|$|E
