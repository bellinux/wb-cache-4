Miss Grandison was very unwell; and Lady Armine, frightened by the recent danger from which they had escaped, very alarmed. She could no longer conceal from Ferdinand that his Katherine was here, and perhaps Lady Armine was somewhat surprised at the calmness with which her son received the intelligence. But Miss Grandison was not only very unwell but very obstinate. She would not leave her room, but insisted that no medical advice should be called in. Lady Armine protested, supplicated, adjured; Miss Grandison appealed to Mr. Glastonbury; and Glastonbury, who was somewhat of a physician, was called in, and was obliged to assure Lady Armine that Miss Grandison was only suffering from a cold and only required repose. A warm friendship subsisted between Lady Armine and her niece. She had always been Katherine's favourite aunt, and during the past year there had been <b>urgent</b> <b>reasons</b> why Lady Armine should have cherished this predisposition in her favour. Lady Armine was a fascinating person, and all her powers had been employed to obtain an influence over the heiress. They had been quite successful. Miss Grandi-son looked forward almost with as much pleasure to being Lady Armine's daughter as her son's bride. The intended mother-in-law was in turn as warmhearted as her niece was engaging; and eventually Lady Armine loved Katherine for herself alone.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: In England, {{there is}} a policy of {{offering}} healthy women with straightforward pregnancies a choice of birth setting. Options may include home or a freestanding midwifery unit (FMU). Transfer rates from these settings are around 20 %, and higher for nulliparous women. The duration of transfer is of interest {{because of the potential}} for delay in access to specialist care and is also of concern to women. We aimed to estimate the duration of transfer in births planned at home and in FMUs and explore the effects of distance and urgency on duration. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of data collected in a national prospective cohort study including 27, 842 'low risk' women with singleton, term, 'booked' pregnancies, planning birth in FMUs or at home in England from April 2008 to April 2010. We described transfer duration using the median and interquartile range, for all transfers and those for reasons defined as potentially urgent or non-urgent, and used cumulative distribution curves to compare transfer duration by urgency. We explored the effect of distance for transfers from FMUs and described outcomes in women giving birth within 60  minutes of transfer. RESULTS: The median overall transfer time, from decision to transfer to first OU assessment, was shorter in transfers from home compared with transfers from FMUs (49 vs 60  minutes; p[*]<[*] 0. 001). The median duration of transfers before birth for potentially <b>urgent</b> <b>reasons</b> (home 42  minutes, FMU 50  minutes) was 8 - 10  minutes shorter compared with transfers for non-urgent reasons. In transfers for potentially <b>urgent</b> <b>reasons,</b> the median overall transfer time from FMUs within 20  km of an OU was 47  minutes, increasing to 55  minutes from FMUs 20 - 40  km away and 61  minutes in more remote FMUs. In women who gave birth within 60  minutes after transfer, adverse neonatal outcomes occurred in 1 - 2 % of transfers. CONCLUSIONS: Transfers from home or FMU commonly take up to 60  minutes from decision to transfer, to first assessment in an OU, even for transfers for potentially <b>urgent</b> <b>reasons.</b> Most transfers are not urgent and emergencies and adverse outcomes are uncommon, but urgent transfer is more likely for nulliparous women...|$|E

Nulliparous woman are referred more often than multiparous women [1 - 8]. This is also the case in the Netherlands [9, 10]. Referral rates vary between maternity care settings.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} risk {{indicators for}} referral during labor from community midwife to a gynecologist in a prospective cohort {{of women with}} a singleton term pregnancy, starting labor with a community midwife between 2000 and 2007, registered in the Dutch national perinatal registry. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Referral from community midwife to a gynecologist during labor, because of fetal distress, failure to progress in second stage of labor, meconium stained amniotic fluid, failure to progress in first stage of labor, wish for pain relief, a combination of other less <b>urgent</b> <b>reasons</b> or no referral (reference). RESULTS: A total of 241 [*] 595 (32 %) were referred from community midwife to a gynecologist during labor, because of fetal distress (FD; 5 %), failure to progress in second stage of labor (FTP 2; 14 %), meconium stained amniotic fluid (MSAF; 24 %), failure to progress in first stage of labor (FTP 1; 17 %), wish for pain relief (WFPR; 7 %) {{or a combination of}} other less <b>urgent</b> <b>reasons,</b> for example, malpresentation (e. g. breech) or other nonspecified problems (OTHER; 33 %). The strongest overall risk indicators were gestational age (lower risk of referral because of FD, FTP 2, MSAF, FTP 1 and WFPR and a higher risk of referral because of OTHER at a gestational age between 37 (+ 0) and 37 (+) (6) weeks, and higher risks of referral for all reasons at a gestational age[*]≥ 41 (+) (0) when compared to a gestational age between 38 [*](+) (0) and 40 [*](+) (6) weeks and no referral), the intended place of delivery (higher risk of all types of referral compared to no referral when the intended place of delivery was either at a midwife-led birth center or a hospital instead of at home) and birth history (higher risk of all types of referral compared to no referral when women had a history of instrumental vaginal delivery or when they were nulliparous instead of being multiparous without a history of an instrument vaginal delivery). Risk indicators associated with specific reasons of referral were maternal age, ethnicity, degree of urbanization, social economic status, neonatal gender and birth weight. CONCLUSIONS: Among low-risk pregnant women, a referral during labor is associated with readily available risk indicators. These risk indicators may be used to increase referral risk awareness and to counsel women for the intended place to start labor...|$|E
