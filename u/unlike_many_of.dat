5|$|A Momentary Lapse of Reason was {{recorded}} primarily on Gilmour's converted houseboat, Astoria. Its production {{was marked by}} an ongoing legal dispute with Waters as to who owned the rights to Pink Floyd's name, an issue resolved several months after the album was released. <b>Unlike</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> Pink Floyd's studio albums, A Momentary Lapse of Reason has no central theme and is instead a collection of songs written by Gilmour, sometimes with outside songwriters.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from his}} death, remarkably {{little is known}} of Cooke's circumstances. Even his date of birth is unclear, and <b>unlike</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well {{respected}} in his profession and following his death {{was the subject of}} tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in St Paul's Cathedral and his local church in Wiltshire.|$|E
5|$|Jeanne d'Arc was a wooden-hulled armored {{corvette}} {{built for}} the French Navy in the late 1860s. She was named for Joan of Arc, a Roman Catholic saint and heroine of the Hundred Years War. Jeanne d'Arc participated in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71 and remained in commission afterwards, <b>unlike</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> her sisters. The ship was condemned in 1883, but nothing further is known as to her disposition.|$|E

5|$|Jewell was the 51st Secretary of the Interior, and {{the second}} woman to hold the position. <b>Unlike</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> her predecessors, Jewell never held elected office. Because she {{acquired}} her U.S. citizenship by naturalization rather than being a natural-born citizen, Jewell was not eligible to hold a place within the presidential line of succession.|$|E
5|$|<b>Unlike</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> its fellow mimids, {{the black}} catbird {{is not known}} to imitate any other species. Its song {{consists}} of repeated phrases of notes ranging from harsh and scratchy to warbled and flute-like, often interspersed with metallic clicking buzzes. It often sings from exposed perches. It {{has a variety of}} calls, including some which are quite {{similar to those of the}} gray catbird; these are variously described as a harsh rriah, a nasal chrrh and a grating tcheeu.|$|E
5|$|<b>Unlike</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> {{the other}} British Orders, the stall plates (or hatchment plates) do not form a {{continuous}} {{record of the}} Knights of the Order. There are only 34 stall plates for the 80 or so knights appointed before 1871, (although others were destroyed in a fire in 1940), and 40 hatchments plates for the 60 knights appointed subsequently. In {{the case of the}} stall plates this was perhaps due to their size, 30x36 cm (12x14 in).|$|E

5|$|<b>Unlike</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> their Asian counterparts, Filipinos do not {{eat with}} chopsticks; they use Western cutlery.

5|$|After his release, Bo Xilai {{worked at}} the Hardware Repair Factory for the Beijing Second Light Industry Bureau. He was {{admitted}} to the Peking University by public examination in 1977. <b>Unlike</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> his contemporaries in the Chinese leadership who studied engineering, Bo majored in world history. In the second year of his studies, Bo enlisted in a Master's program in international journalism at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, graduating with a master's degree in 1982. He joined the Communist Party in October 1980.|$|E
5|$|Before Stanton {{narrowed her}} {{political}} focus {{almost exclusively to}} women's rights, she was an active abolitionist with her husband Henry Brewster Stanton (co-founder of the Republican Party) and cousin Gerrit Smith. <b>Unlike</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> {{those involved in the}} women's rights movement, Stanton addressed various issues pertaining to women beyond voting rights. Her concerns included women's parental and custody rights, property rights, employment and income rights, divorce, the economic health of the family, and birth control. She was also an outspoken supporter of the 19th-century temperance movement.|$|E

5|$|During the Japanese {{attack on}} Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, Arizona was bombed. After a bomb detonated in a powder magazine, the {{battleship}} exploded violently and sank, {{with the loss}} of 1,177officers and crewmen. <b>Unlike</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the other ships sunk or damaged that day, Arizona was irreparably damaged by the force of the magazine explosion, though the Navy removed parts of the ship for reuse. The wreck still lies at the bottom of Pearl Harbor and the USS Arizona Memorial, dedicated on 30 May 1962 to all those who died during the attack, straddles the ship's hull.|$|E
5|$|In June 1941, Nazi Germany {{invaded the}} Soviet Union. <b>Unlike</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the border troops who were {{caught off guard}} by the offensive, Bagramyan and his commander, General Mikhail Kirponos, {{believed}} an invasion by Germany was inevitable. However, Kirponos chose to ignore Bagramyan's viewpoint that the German offensive would employ the lightning speed Blitzkrieg tactics like those seen in the campaigns in Poland in 1939 and Western Europe in 1940. Since the winter of 1939–40, Bagramyan had been busy devising a battle plan that would counter threats from the western Ukraine, which was approved after numerous revisions on 10 May 1940.|$|E
5|$|On 19 February, {{the band}} {{departed}} Dublin for the US {{to prepare for}} the tour. While rehearsing in Lakeland for opening night, Eno consulted U2 on the visual aspects of the show. <b>Unlike</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the group's previous tours, which began ahead of or coincident with the release of a new album, Zoo TV started four months after Achtung Baby was released, giving fans more time to familiarise themselves with the new songs. By opening night, the album had already sold threemillion copies in the US and sevenmillion worldwide.|$|E

5|$|While it {{contains}} some small role-playing elements, Dawn of Mana diverges from the prior two-dimensional action role-playing game titles {{of the series}} to focus directly on action-adventure gameplay in a full 3D world. Incorporating the Havok physics engine, the gameplay focuses on the player grabbing and throwing objects and monsters in order to startle enemies before attacking them with a sword and magic. Keldric grows more powerful as the player journeys through an area, only to reset to his base abilities with each new zone unless difficult extra challenges are met. <b>Unlike</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> its predecessors, the game does not feature any cooperative multiplayer component.|$|E
5|$|Żółkiewski {{attended}} a cathedral school in Lwów (now L'viv, Ukraine). <b>Unlike</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> his peers {{he had no}} higher education and did not travel abroad. However, he pursued studies {{on his own and}} was particularly interested in history and historical literature. In 1566 he joined the court of King Sigismund II Augustus, as an aid to the king's secretary Jan Zamoyski. There he became familiar with the executionist movement, which advocated numerous reforms including military ones. In 1573 he took part in the diplomatic mission to France, sent to meet a newly elected king Henry III of France, and on his way back he was sent to Vienna to appease the Habsburgs.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Stanton {{maintained}} a broad focus on women's rights in general rather than narrowing her focus only to female suffrage in particular. After {{passage of the}} Fifteenth Amendment in 1870 and its support by the Equal Rights Association and prominent suffragists such as Stone, Blackwell, and Howe, the gap between Elizabeth Cady Stanton and other leaders of the women's movement widened as Stanton took issue with the fundamental religious leanings of several movement leaders. <b>Unlike</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> her colleagues, Stanton believed organized Christianity relegated women to an unacceptable position in society. She explored this view in the 1890s in The Woman's Bible, which elucidated a feminist understanding of biblical scripture and sought to correct the fundamental sexism Stanton believed was inherent to organized Christianity. Likewise, Stanton supported divorce rights, employment rights, and property rights for women, issues in which the American Women's Suffrage Association (AWSA) preferred not to become involved.|$|E

5|$|Four Times of the Day is {{a series}} of four {{paintings}} by English artist William Hogarth. Completed in 1736, they were reproduced as a series of four engravings published in 1738. They are humorous depictions of life in the streets of London, the vagaries of fashion, and the interactions between the rich and poor. <b>Unlike</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> Hogarth's other series, such as A Harlot's Progress, A Rake's Progress, Industry and Idleness, and The Four Stages of Cruelty, it does not depict the story of an individual, but instead focuses on the society of the city. Hogarth intended the series to be humorous rather than instructional; the pictures do not offer a judgment on whether the rich or poor are more deserving of the viewer's sympathies: while the upper and middle classes tend to provide the focus for each scene, there are fewer of the moral comparisons seen in some of his other works.|$|E
5|$|The Ottoman fleet began mobilizing in September 1876 {{to prepare}} for a {{conflict}} with Russia, as tensions with the country had been growing for several years, an insurrection had begun in Ottoman Bosnia in mid-1875, and Serbia had declared war on the Ottoman Empire in July 1876. The Russo-Turkish War began on 24 April 1877 with a Russian declaration of war, but <b>unlike</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the other, smaller Ottoman ironclads, Osmaniye and her sister ships remained in the Mediterranean Fleet. The Navy feared losing the largest ships of its fleet, and so kept them primarily in port {{for the duration of the}} conflict. The wooden warships of the Mediterranean Fleet sortied in April 1877 to patrol the coast of Albania, but Osmaniye and the rest of the ironclads remained in Souda Bay. In January 1878, Osmaniye served briefly as a troop transport to help carry Ottoman soldiers to the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|<b>Unlike</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> {{the sets}} {{featured}} on the show which were filmed on a Fox soundstage, the shot of the buried alien space craft was actually filmed in the hills near Simi Valley, California. Carter wanted a full-scale mock-up of the alien ship {{to be buried in}} the ground. This was unusual for the show; usually, {{a small portion of the}} ship would have been buried in the ground and the rest would have been filled in either via digital graphics, or with a scale model. In this episode, however, all of the shots of the alien ship, sans the take off, were done practically. To create the otherworldly glow of the ship, over 100 lamps were hidden within the craft. In addition, the ship itself was covered in glyphs that are supposed to be part of an unknown alien language. This was accomplished by designing fictional characters and programming them into a computer. These were then printed as letters which could be applied to the ship's hull.|$|E
