40|$|Because of German {{surveyors}} {{becoming increasingly}} {{involved in the}} international debate on land management, the article focuses on actual world-wide trends: Urban growth rates are still very high in many developing countries. As {{a result of the}} uncontrolled and uncoordinated growth of many cities, urban development is far from being sustainable. At present, two international campaigns promoted by <b>UNCHS</b> (<b>Habitat)</b> focus explicitly on sustainable urban development: the global campaign for (good) urban governance and the one for secure tenure. The paper shows how the incorporation of the norms of good urban governance- sustainability, subsidiarity, equity, efficiency, transparency and accountability, civic engagement and citizenship, and security- in urban land management offers ways to improve the actual situation. One by one, the norms are briefly described according to their objectives proposed by UNCHS and subsequently are applied to urban land management. In conclusion, the importance of the changing role of the State and the empowerment of Civil Society are highlighted.

40|$|The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC), in {{collaboration}} with the World Bank, UNDP, <b>UNCHS</b> (<b>HABITAT)</b> and the Western Provincial Council (WPC) in Sri Lanka, launched a project in February 2000 to formulate a comprehensive strategy framework and a perspective plan of action for development of the city. The purpose was to identify key areas and issues that need systemic and planned attention of the Council and other major stakeholders and to develop appropriate strategies to address them. A Senior Consultant was assigned to the CMC by the sponsors to help formulate the strategy through a consultative process. In formulating the strategy framework, the CMC consulted a wide variety of stakeholder groups through a series of formal and informal consultations. They included civil society partners such as NGOs and CBOs, representatives of the poor; senior municipal officials; and leading private sector representatives, i. e., major investors, realtors, developers and Chambers of Commerce & Industry. Their views, ideas and suggestions were reviewed and those compatible with the development vision and thrust identified by the CMC task forces and stakeholder consultations are incorporated in this strategy framework. All stakeholders, particularly the private sector, considered the opportunity as an unprecedented move by the CMC and WPC. They welcomed the offer to join in this unique partnership-building exercise in city management and have assured the city administration of their wholehearted cooperation...|$|E

40|$|There are {{few changes}} {{in the history of}} human {{existence}} comparable to urbanization in scope and potential to bring about biologic change. The transition in the developed world from an agricultural to an industrial-urban society has already produced substantial changes in human health, morphology and growth (Schell, Smith and Bilsborough, 1993, p. 1). By the year 2000, about 50 % of the world s total population will be living crowded in urban areas and soon thereafter, by the year 2025 as the global urban population reaches the 5 billion mark more of the world s population will be living in urban areas. This has enormous health consequences. By the close of the twenty-first century, more people will be packed into the urban areas of the developing world than are alive on the planet today (<b>UNCHS</b> (<b>Habitat),</b> 1996, p. xxi). Africa presents a particularly poignant example of the problems involved, as it has the fastest population and urban growth in the world as well as the lowest economic development and growth and many of the poorest countries, especially in Tropical Africa. Thus it exemplifies in stark reality many of the worst difficulties of urban health and ecology (Clarke, 1993, p. 260). This essay is therefore concerned to analyse the trends of urbanization in Africa. This is followed by an overview of the environmental conditions of Africa s towns and cities. The subsequent section explores the links between the urban environment and health. Although the focus is with physical hazards {{it is important to note}} that the social milieu is also vital in the reproduction of health. The paper concludes by providing some policy recommendations...|$|E
