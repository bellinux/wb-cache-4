At the beginning of February, Ilustrovana Politika magazine published a letter written by a teenager, who wrote about political suitability of Đorđević and Riblja Čorba.

They were soon joined in their demands by SUBNORs of Sarajevo and Bezdan, as well as by League of Communist Youth of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The scandal saw large covering in the media, which had the effect on the concerts. The band had to cut short their concert in Celje, because the firemen appointed as security were aggressive towards the audience. The concert in Sarajevo was held only after Đorđević wrote explanations for the lyrics of the songs the band would perform and signed a liability waiver, stating that he would perform the song [...] "Na zapadu ništa novo" [...] on his own risk. The concert in Tuzla was canceled because, as the organizers stated, [...] "order can not be guaranteed on a concert of a group actions of which are not in accordance with socialist morale".

The organization was established on February 10, 1949, during a meeting of all partisan commanders in Minaičiai village. Jonas Žemaitis (codename Vytautas) was elected as the chairman of its presidium. On February 16, the 21st anniversary of the 1918 Act of Independence <b>of</b> Lithuania, the <b>Union</b> adopted a declaration proclaiming itself to be the supreme political and military authority in Lithuania. In 1996, after Lithuania regained independence in 1990, the Seimas (parliament) recognized the declaration as an official act of the Republic of Lithuania and Žemaitis as President of Lithuania. The organization and the partisan war were suppressed by the Soviet security agencies by 1953.|$|R
25|$|At {{the end of}} World War II, the Red Army {{pushed the}} Eastern Front towards Lithuania. The Soviets invaded and {{occupied}} Lithuania {{by the end of}} 1944. As forced conscription into Red Army and Stalinist repressions intensified, thousands of Lithuanians used forests in the countryside as a natural refuge. These spontaneous groups became more organized and centralized culminating in the establishment <b>of</b> the <b>Union</b> <b>of</b> Lithuanian Freedom <b>Fighters</b> in February 1948. In their documents, the partisans emphasized that their ultimate goal is recreation of independent Lithuania. As the partisan war continued, {{it became clear that the}} West would not interfere in Eastern Europe (see Western betrayal) and that the partisans had no chance of success against the far stronger opponent. Eventually, the partisans made an explicit and conscious decision not to accept any new members. The leadership of the partisans was destroyed in 1953 thus effectively ending the partisan war, though individual fighters held out until the 1960s.|$|R
50|$|Many LLA members {{retreated to}} Germany, {{becoming}} the displaced persons, others {{responded to the}} call starting the Lithuanian partisan movement. According to the testimony of Eidimtas to NKVD, by mid-1944 LLA numbered up to 10,000 men, but that is likely an exaggeration. The LLA obtained limited amount of armament and munitions from Nazi Germany. In August-September 1944, LLA sent about 100 fighters to a German reconnaissance school; they returned as paratroopers. The organization was not successful in fighting the Soviets. According to official statistics from NKVD, the Soviets killed 659 and arrested 753 members of the LLA by January 26, 1945. Founder Veverskis was killed in December 1944, Eidimtas was arrested in April 1945, the headquarters were liquidated in December 1945. This represented the failure of highly centralized resistance, as the organization was too dependent on Veverskis and other top commanders. Lower-level organization remained, especially in Samogitia and Aukštaitija, and was absorbed by the partisan movement. Remnants of its organizational structure survived {{until the end of}} the guerrilla war in 1953.
