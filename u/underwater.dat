5|$|In {{civilian}} operations, {{police forces}} keep police diving units to perform {{search and rescue}} operations, and to recover evidence. In some cases diver rescue teams may also {{be part of a}} fire department, paramedical service or lifeguard unit, and this may be classed as public safety diving. There are also professional divers such as <b>underwater</b> photographers and videographers, who record the <b>underwater</b> world, and scientific divers in fields of study which involve the <b>underwater</b> environment, including marine biologists, geologists, hydrologists, oceanographers and <b>underwater</b> archaeologists.|$|E
5|$|Recreational diving (sometimes called sport diving or subaquatics) is {{a popular}} leisure activity. Technical diving {{is a form of}} {{recreational}} diving under especially challenging conditions. Professional diving (commercial diving, diving for research purposes, or for financial gain) involve working <b>underwater.</b> Public safety diving is the <b>underwater</b> work done by law enforcement, fire rescue, and <b>underwater</b> search and recovery dive teams. Military diving includes combat diving, clearance diving and ships husbandry.|$|E
5|$|Since 2005, RSMAS has {{conducted}} an <b>underwater</b> photography contest that draws international submissions. RSMAS also makes <b>underwater</b> photographs available through its Digital Atlas of Marine Species and Locations, {{which is a}} database that includes photos of specific marine species.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} dive and swim <b>underwater</b> while holding one's breath is {{considered}} a useful emergency skill, {{an important part of}} water sport and Navy safety training, and an enjoyable leisure activity. <b>Underwater</b> diving without breathing apparatus can be categorised as <b>underwater</b> swimming, snorkelling and freediving. These categories overlap considerably. Several competitive <b>underwater</b> sports are practised without breathing apparatus.|$|E
5|$|After the {{establishment}} of the JACC, a search of the ocean surface by aircraft continued until 28 April. An acoustic <b>underwater</b> search for <b>underwater</b> locator beacons attached to the aircraft's flight recorders ended 14 April, followed by a sonar survey of the seafloor near an area where acoustic detections were made. The sonar survey finished on 28 May and found nil debris from the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|After {{the initial}} search efforts through May, {{the agency has}} worked {{primarily}} with Australian government agencies, Malaysia, and China to plan and carry out the bathymetric survey and <b>underwater</b> search. The JACC works closely with the ATSB, which is the agency responsible for defining the search area and carrying out the tenders for the <b>underwater</b> search and, if possible pieces of Flight 370 are located, the recovery effort. Geoscience Australia works closely with the ATSB to perform the bathymetric survey and <b>underwater</b> search. The JACC also works with Malaysia and China, which have both sent representatives {{to work at the}} JACC offices.|$|E
5|$|Aquaria is a 2D sidescrolling action-adventure game, heavily {{focused on}} {{exploration}} and puzzle-solving, with non-linear gameplay. The player controls Naija, a lone <b>underwater</b> dweller; although {{similar to a}} human woman, Naija also has several fish-like qualities, {{such as the ability}} to breathe <b>underwater</b> and propel herself quickly with webbed feet. The game, originally only available for personal computers, was designed to be primarily controlled solely through the mouse, though it can also be controlled with a keyboard or Xbox 360 controller. The player directs Naija through an <b>underwater</b> world composed of several distinct regions, ranging from caves to <b>underwater</b> ruins to sunlit oases. These areas are filled with plant and animal life, which can be hostile, friendly, or neutral towards her. Hostile plants and animals can hurt Naija, reducing her health meter, by touching her or firing projectiles at her.|$|E
5|$|Autonomous <b>underwater</b> {{vehicles}} (AUVs) and {{remotely operated}} <b>underwater</b> vehicles (ROVs) can carry out some functions of divers. They can be deployed at greater depths and in more dangerous environments. An AUV is a robot which travels <b>underwater</b> without requiring real-time input from an operator. AUVs constitute {{part of a}} larger group of unmanned undersea systems, a classification that includes non-autonomous ROVs, which are controlled and powered from the surface by an operator/pilot via an umbilical or using remote control. In military applications AUVs are often referred to as unmanned undersea vehicles (UUVs).|$|E
5|$|Between 1960 and 1992, the Navy {{carried out}} a program that {{included}} the study of marine mammals' abilities with sonar, {{with the objective of}} improving the detection of <b>underwater</b> objects. A large number of belugas were used from 1975 on, the first being dolphins. The program also included training them to carry equipment and material to divers working <b>underwater</b> by holding cameras in their mouths to locate lost objects, survey ships and submarines, and <b>underwater</b> monitoring. A similar program was used by the Russian Navy during the Cold War, in which belugas were also trained for antimining operations in the Arctic.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{receives}} a spear gun-armed <b>underwater</b> jet pack scuba (allowing the frogman to manoeuvre faster than other frogmen). Designed by Jordan Klein, green dye {{was meant to}} be used by Bond as a smoke screen to escape pursuers. Instead Ricou Browning, the film's <b>underwater</b> director, used it to make Bond's arrival more dramatic.|$|E
5|$|Dippers {{are named}} for their bobbing or dipping movements. They are unique among passerines {{for their ability}} to dive and swim <b>underwater.</b>|$|E
5|$|In October filming {{moved to}} other Greek locations, {{including}} Meteora and the Achilleion. In November the main unit moved to England, which included interior work in Pinewood, {{while the second}} unit shot <b>underwater</b> scenes in the Bahamas. On 1 January 1981 production moved to Cortina d'Ampezzo in Italy, where filming wrapped in February. Many of the <b>underwater</b> scenes, especially involving close-ups of Bond and Melina, were shot on a dry soundstage. A combination of lighting effects, slow-motion photography, wind, and bubbles added in post-production, gave the illusion of the actors being <b>underwater.</b> The pre-credits sequence used a church in Stoke Poges as a cemetery, while scenes involving a helicopter were filmed at the abandoned Beckton Gas Works in London.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} portray the {{characters}} <b>underwater,</b> the actors wore Heelys wheeled footwear, which simulate the gliding action of swimming creatures. The actors playing Ariel and the other merfolk had wire-frame tails attached to their hips. Subsequent productions feature different designs for Ariel and the merfolk; the Dutch and Japanese productions use wirework and aerial stunts {{to create the illusion}} of <b>underwater</b> swimming.|$|E
5|$|July 25: <b>Underwater</b> Baker test at Bikini.|$|E
5|$|Many of the <b>underwater</b> scenes, {{especially}} involving close-ups of Bond and Melina, {{were actually}} faked on a dry soundstage. A combination of lighting effects, slow-motion photography, wind, and bubbles added in post-production, gave {{the illusion of}} the actors being <b>underwater.</b> Actress Carole Bouquet reportedly had a pre-existing health condition that prevented her from performing actual <b>underwater</b> stunt work. Actual aquatic scenes were done by {{a team led by}} Al Giddings, who had previously worked on The Deep, and filmed in either Pinewood's tank on the 007 Stage or an <b>underwater</b> set built in the Bahamas. Production designer Peter Lamont and his team developed two working props for the submarine Neptune, as well as a mock-up with a fake bottom.|$|E
5|$|Noise {{pollution}} from anthropogenic activities is another major concern for marine mammals. This {{is a problem}} because <b>underwater</b> noise pollution interferes with the abilities of some marine mammals to communicate, and locate both predators and prey. <b>Underwater</b> explosions are used {{for a variety of}} purposes including military activities, construction and oceanographic or geophysical research. They can cause injuries such as hemorrhaging of the lungs, and contusion and ulceration of the gastrointestinal tract. <b>Underwater</b> noise is generated from shipping, the oil and gas industry, research, and military use of sonar and oceanographic acoustic experimentation. Acoustic harassment devices and acoustic deterrent devices used by aquaculture facilities to scare away marine mammals emit loud and noxious <b>underwater</b> sounds.|$|E
5|$|On {{arriving}} in Nassau, McClory searched for locations to shoot {{many of the}} key sequences of the film and used {{the home of a}} local millionaire couple, the Sullivans, for Largo's estate, Palmyra. Part of the SPECTRE <b>underwater</b> assault was also shot on the coastal grounds of another millionaire's home on the island. The most difficult sequences to film were the <b>underwater</b> action scenes; the first to be shot <b>underwater</b> was at a depth of 50 feet to shoot the scene where SPECTRE divers remove the atomic bombs from the sunken Vulcan bomber. Peter Lamont had previously visited a Royal Air Force bomber station carrying a concealed camera which he used to get close-up shots of secret missiles (those appearing in the film were not actually present). Most of the <b>underwater</b> scenes had to be done at lower tides due to the sharks on the Bahamian coast.|$|E
5|$|Poisoning {{may also}} occur {{following}} {{the use of}} a self-contained <b>underwater</b> breathing apparatus (SCUBA) due to faulty diving air compressors.|$|E
5|$|SEAL Delivery Vehicle Teams are SEAL {{teams with}} an added <b>underwater</b> {{delivery}} capability {{who use the}} SDV MK VIII and the Advanced SEAL Delivery System (ASDS), submersibles that provides NSW with an unprecedented capability that combines the attributes of clandestine <b>underwater</b> mobility and the combat swimmer.|$|E
5|$|The Amador Valley Robotics Team, {{founded in}} 1999, {{is the first}} and only high school team to compete in the Autonomous <b>Underwater</b> Vehicle (AUV) Competition hosted by the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI). Each year, with a minimal amount of outside {{technical}} assistance, the team develops an AUV to maneuver an <b>underwater</b> obstacle course.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} breath-hold diving goes {{back at least}} to {{classical}} times, and there is evidence of prehistoric hunting and gathering of seafoods that may have involved <b>underwater</b> swimming. Technical advances allowing the provision of breathing gas to a diver <b>underwater</b> at ambient pressure are recent, and self-contained breathing systems developed at an accelerated rate following the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|The {{pinniped}} ear {{is adapted}} for hearing <b>underwater,</b> {{where it can}} hear sound frequencies at up to 70,000Hz. In air, hearing is somewhat reduced in pinnipeds compared to many terrestrial mammals. While {{they are capable of}} hearing a wide range of frequencies (e.g. 500 to 32,000Hz in the northern fur seal, compared to 20 to 20,000Hz in humans), their airborne hearing sensitivity is weaker overall. One study of three species—the harbor seal, California sea lion and northern elephant seal—found that the sea lion was best adapted for airborne hearing, the harbor seal was equally capable of hearing in air and water, and the elephant seal was better adapted for <b>underwater</b> hearing. Although pinnipeds have a fairly good sense of smell on land, it is useless <b>underwater</b> as their nostrils are closed.|$|E
5|$|The {{sound of}} raindrops hitting water {{is caused by}} bubbles of air {{oscillating}} <b>underwater.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Underwater</b> diver {{training}} is normally {{given by a}} qualified instructor {{who is a member}} of one of many diver training agencies or is registered with a government agency. Basic diver training entails the learning of skills required for the safe conduct of activities in an <b>underwater</b> environment, and includes procedures and skills for the use of diving equipment, safety, emergency self-help and rescue procedures, dive planning, and use of dive tables. Diving hand signals are used to communicate <b>underwater.</b> Professional divers will also learn other methods of communication.|$|E
5|$|<b>Underwater</b> {{vision is}} {{affected}} by the clarity and the refractive index of the medium. Visibility <b>underwater</b> is reduced because light passing through water attenuates rapidly with distance, leading to lower levels of natural illumination. <b>Underwater</b> objects are also blurred by scattering of light between the object and the viewer, resulting in lower contrast. These effects vary with the wavelength of the light, and the colour and turbidity of the water. The human eye is optimised for air vision, and when it is immersed in direct contact with water, visual acuity is adversely affected by the difference in refractive index between water and air. Provision of an airspace between the cornea and the water can compensate, but causes scale and distance distortion. Artificial illumination can improve visibility at short range. Stereoscopic acuity, the ability to judge relative distances of different objects, is considerably reduced <b>underwater,</b> and this {{is affected by}} the field of vision. A narrow field of vision caused by a small viewport in a helmet results in greatly reduced stereoacuity, and an apparent movement of a stationary object when the head is moved. These effects lead to poorer hand-eye coordination.|$|E
5|$|Written by Trevor Ray, {{this story}} {{would have been}} set <b>underwater.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of insects live either part or the whole of their lives <b>underwater.</b> In {{many of the more}} {{primitive}} orders of insect, the immature stages are spent in an aquatic environment. Some groups of insects, like certain water beetles, have aquatic adults as well.|$|E
5|$|A scuba diver moves <b>underwater</b> {{by using}} fins {{attached}} to the feet; external propulsion can be provided by a diver propulsion vehicle, or a towboard pulled from the surface. Other equipment includes a diving mask to improve <b>underwater</b> vision, a protective diving suit, equipment to control buoyancy, and equipment related to the specific circumstances and purpose of the dive. Scuba divers are trained in the procedures and skills appropriate to their level of certification by instructors affiliated to the diver certification organisations which issue these diver certifications. These include standard operating procedures for using the equipment {{and dealing with the}} general hazards of the <b>underwater</b> environment, and emergency procedures for self-help and assistance of a similarly equipped diver experiencing problems. A minimum level of fitness and health is required by most training organisations, and a higher level of fitness may be needed for some applications.|$|E
5|$|Apart from <b>underwater</b> ecosystem, Weh {{island is}} the only habitat of one {{threatened}} species of toad, Duttaphrynus valhallae (formerly Bufo valhallae). The species is only known from the holotype from the island. Due to heavy forestation on the island, {{the survival of the}} species is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Bond and Amasova examine Stromberg's <b>underwater</b> Atlantis {{base from}} an American submarine, and confirm {{that he is}} {{operating}} the stolen tracking system. The Liparus captures the submarine. Stromberg sets his plan in motion: the simultaneous launching of nuclear missiles from British and Soviet submarines to destroy Moscow and New York City. This would trigger a global nuclear war, which Stromberg would survive in Atlantis, and subsequently a new civilisation would be established <b>underwater.</b> He leaves for Atlantis with Amasova. Bond escapes and frees the captured British, Russian and American sailors and they battle the Liparuss crew. Bond reprograms the submarines to fire missiles at each other, saving Moscow and New York City. The victorious submariners escape the sinking Liparus on the American submarine.|$|E
5|$|Cetaceans {{includes}} whales, dolphins and porpoises. They are the mammals most fully {{adapted to}} aquatic {{life with a}} spindle-shaped nearly hairless body, protected by {{a thick layer of}} blubber, and forelimbs and tail modified to provide propulsion <b>underwater.</b>|$|E
5|$|Details of the {{methodology}} used to analyse the satellite communications were {{provided in the}} Australian Transport Safety Bureau's report MH370– Definition of <b>Underwater</b> Search Areas, published in June, and a supplement released in October.|$|E
5|$|Hartley {{explained}} that Arthur would {{be aware of}} his powers {{at the beginning of}} the series and would have no problem using them for personal gain. Hartley felt this played against the typical superheroes, because his character was not afraid to flaunt his abilities. Gough explained A.C. would be able to swim faster than humans, breathe <b>underwater,</b> as well as have super strength while <b>underwater.</b> He also stated that exposure to water on land would give him powers. The extent of his speed is shown in the pilot, when Arthur is able to keep up with a fighter jet flying above him. The extent of A.C.'s ability to breathe <b>underwater</b> was not elaborated upon, but he is seen swimming near the bottom of the ocean near the start of the pilot. When A.C. is talking to Eva about releasing captive dolphins, he tells her that he felt as though the dolphins were somehow calling to him. In the comics, one of Aquaman's powers is the ability to communicate with sea life. Gough likened A.C.'s not having access to water to Clark's growing weak around kryptonite in Smallville – if A.C. does not get water, he will dehydrate and weaken. Water gives him a power boost and enables producers to explore stories on land.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation {{returned}} {{all eight}} broadcast prints of Galaxy 4 and The <b>Underwater</b> Menace to the BBC to be disposed of. In the mid-1980s, former ITV engineer Terry Burnett purchased episode 3 of Galaxy 4 and episode 2 of The <b>Underwater</b> Menace from another collector, unaware of their value (the only extant {{episode of the}} former serial, and one of just two from the latter). In December 2011, after a chance encounter with Doctor Who Restoration Team member Ralph Montagu, Burnett returned the episodes to the BBC.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Roy Manstan, Fred Frese, and the Naval <b>Underwater</b> Warfare Center {{partnered with}} {{students}} from Old Saybrook High School in Connecticut on a four-year project called The Turtle Project, to construct their own working replica, which they completed and launched in 2007.|$|E
5|$|In March 2010, <b>underwater</b> {{searches}} {{were conducted}} by Aruban authorities after an American couple {{reported that they were}} snorkeling when they photographed what they thought might be human skeletal remains, possibly those of Holloway. Aruban authorities sent divers to investigate, but no remains were ever recovered.|$|E
