40|$|The present {{paper is}} the first work {{in a series of}} studies on {{bacterial}} f l o ra of female urethra, and gives some remarks and devices on the method for isolating of bacteria from an appointed part on female urethra under special procedures by which the internal part of urethra was prevented from invasion of microorganisms of urethral orifice. 1) The respective internal part of 1. 0 c m, 1. 5 c m, 2. 0 c m and 3. 0 c m in the distance from the external urethral orifice were cleaned with 1 % cresol solution and then the following instruments were inserted up to the depth of the respective cleaned part as below mentioned 7 kinds of procedure (1) Frankel's Conchoscope, (2) Glass tube (a size of Chariere No. 20), (3) Otoscope (a morning-glory like shape) or (4) <b>Urethroscope,</b> the tip of which is cut off, were respectively inserted into urethra to prevent the cleaned urethra from its surrounding contamination. Then, bacterial flora was isolated from the respective part on urethra by means of the sterilized swab method, which was followed by direct smearing of the bacteria upon a medium. Besides, by using (5) Otoscope or (6) <b>Urethroscope</b> (each of same to the above mentioned), bacterial flora in urethra was printed on a gum-strip which is made of condom in a narrow girdle. In the method (7), urethral bacteria were adhered on a Glass-tube of 1 mm in diameter and 4 cm in length by making the tube touched on the wall of urethra through the lateral hole of <b>Urethroscope.</b> 2) In 170 n ormal female human subjects, bacterial flora was iso l a ted from appointed parts on the urethra by means of the above respective ' kinds of isolating method, and, as the control, the bacterial flora was also collected under conditions without cleaning of the urethra. The respective bacterial flora was subjected to the experiments of aerobic cultivation. 3) B e ing {{based on the results of}} the culture of bacterial flora which was isolated from an appointed part on urethra by means of the above 7 kinds of sterilization method as well as the control method, comparative studies were undertaken to determine the superiority or inferiority among the all 8 kinds of procedure mentioned above. It was suggested that the simple procedures with the least contamination are the method (3) so far as the isolation of flora is made from an inner part of 2. 5 cm in the distance from he external urethral orifice, and also method (4) so far, as the isolation is made from the further internal part of urethra. Satisfactory results were obtained in pure cultivation in case that both method, (3) and (4), were used conjunctively with each other...|$|E
30|$|Urethral {{diverticulum}} {{is divided}} into primary urethral diverticulum and acquired urethral diverticulum. Acquired diverticula {{as a consequence of}} urethral or meatal stenosis are a well-known complication of hypospadias operation (Ozgok et al. 1994). The other reasons we could easily find include inflammation, Trauma and tumor, as well as well as some secondary changes caused by <b>urethroscope,</b> catheter, and other medical instrument. The congenital diverticulum is rare in men, 90  % of which is secondary (Ortlip et al. 1980) and it is often appeared in female due to the reason that they have an anatomically poorly supported urethral. The men who could be diagnosed of the congenital diverticulum are mostly in childhood or adolescence, the average age of patients is 13  years old. Clinical manifestation of the urethral diverticulum included urinary infection, hematuresis, dysuresia, urine weakness and urinary tract obstruction.|$|E
30|$|Numerous {{articles}} {{are devoted to}} complications that occur during retrograde semi-rigid ureteroscopy procedures (Tello Royloa et al. 1992;Geavlete et al. 2006;Abdelrahim et al. 2008;Taie et al. 2012). In the various articles, intraoperative complications were reported in 5.9 %- 28 % of all procedures while ureteral perforations were observed in 0.65 %- 9 % of cases. It was further stated {{that the number of}} adverse events during ureteroscopy and lithotripsy procedures is strongly dependent on the experience and qualifications of the physician. Therefore, the percentage of intraoperative complications that we recorded during this the multi-centered study correlates well with data in the literature for semi-rigid ureteroscopy. Thus, we believe that most cases of perforation were related to the mechanical force and not the electrical force applied by the <b>urethroscope</b> on the altered wall of the ureter. In 9 cases, the endoscopic intervention that had begun was terminated: six patients underwent open operation – ureterolithotomy – while in three other cases a stent was installed followed by successful repeated NEPL. In all other cases NEPL was successfully concluded.|$|E
40|$|For {{the purpose}} of scrutinizing a {{character}} o f the De Graaf's phenomenon, {{we have made a}} string of experiment. The process o f the experiment was to inject several kinds of radio-opaque medias which were slightly colored solution with indigocarmine into vas deferens, observing the posterior urethra with <b>urethroscope.</b> When injected media had amounted to the quantities of 0. 8 cc at maximum and of 0. 9 cc at minimum respectively, it was observed that they had flown out of the ejaculatory ducts to the posterior urethra. And it was also recognized at ten seconds in the quickest case and fourty seconds in the slowest case after the injection of radio-oparue medias. From the result of this experiment, we believe that : 1) De G raaf 's phenomen o n really exists and a very small quantity of any liquid injected through the vas deferens does not flow into the seminal vesicles, but directly flows into the ejaculatory ducts. 2) A micturiation after the injection of liquid into the vas deferens probably occurs just when the liquid comes from the posterior urethra into the bladder...|$|E
30|$|Diagnosis basis: The initial {{diagnosis}} of a urethral diverticulum {{must be based on}} a high suspicion. Young men and children presenting with obstructive lower urinary tract symptoms and patients with risk factors for the development of acquired diverticula should be of caution. The male urethral diverticulum diagnosis mainly relies on the detailed medical history and related examinations, which include retrograde urography, IVU, MRI, Urethroscopy. Diagnosis rests essentially on the micturating cystourethrography (Paulhac et al. 2003). Retrograde urethrography may also suggest the presence of the anterior urethral diverticulum as in the present case. Magnetic resonance (MRI) is easy to operate, and it can show the size, shape, location of the urethral diverticulum more clearly, as well as the relationship with the peripheral tissue. MRI could also lead to fewer radiation injuries to the patient. So MRI {{is becoming more and more}} popular in imaging of the male urethral diverticulum. <b>Urethroscope</b> evaluation has the advantage of helping in visualization of associated anterior urethral valves, size of the neck of the diverticulum, appearance of the adjacent urethral mucosa and evaluation for feasibility of endoscopic definitive management. Ultrasound is used in partial clinic application. Ultrasound could inspect the penis or scrotal directly. The approach of ultrasonic examination includes by the perineum or the rectum is widely applied in clinical screening. In some cases, several examinations are needed for detecting the urethral diverticulum. But in some cases reported imaging studies are not always useful. Cai et al. (2008) reported one congenital case that imaging studies are not always useful for correct diagnosis, and that only a surgical approach can allow {{diagnosis of}} the presence of urethral diverticulum. This patient is the case that needs more examinations to make a definite diagnose due to the concealment of the illness.|$|E
