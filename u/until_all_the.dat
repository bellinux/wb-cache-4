However, militants in the room fired back at the SSG, and Ghazi was killed in the crossfire. Other reports say that Ghazi came out of a bunker to surrender, only to be shot by his own forces. The fighting continued <b>until</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> personnel trapped in the basement either surrendered or were killed.|$|E

5|$|Diplomacy failed despite {{continuing}} pressure {{applied by}} the Allies against Athens. On 24 November, du Fournet presented a 7-day ultimatum demanding the immediate surrender {{of at least}} ten Greek mountain artillery batteries. Du Fournet was instructed not {{to use force to}} take possession of the batteries. The admiral made a last effort to persuade the king to accept France's demands. He advised the king that he would land an Allied contingent, and occupy certain positions in Athens <b>until</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> demands were accepted by Greece. The king said that the citizens of Greece, as well as the army, were against disarmament, and only promised that the Greek forces would not attack the Allies.|$|E

She lands on Krazoa Palace, after receiving a distress call from the planet and discovers that it was attacked by General Scales and the SharpClaw army. Krystal is persuaded by a wounded EarthWalker in the Palace to help by collecting all of the Krazoa Spirits and returning them to the palace, which would supposedly tilt the war in the dinosaurs' favour and stop Scales. However, after releasing the first one, a mysterious being sends Krystal into the spirit's path, trapping her in a floating crystal atop the Krazoa Palace <b>until</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> spirits can be returned.|$|E
5|$|In La Pintada, {{a remote}} fishing village of around 400residents {{situated}} {{to the west}} of Acapulco, a mudslide occurred on September14, which within a few minutes, swept through the center of town. As such, many residents initially wandered throughout town in a state of panic and confusion; it took two days for word of the mudslide to spread to the public. Throughout the village, 71people were killed. Over half the town, including 20homes, were demolished due to the mudslide. A total of 334people were evacuated by police, though 30elected to stay in the area <b>until</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> victims had been identified.

5|$|In {{response}} to a typhus epidemic in the women's camp, Mengele cleared one block of 600 Jewish women {{and sent them to}} the gas chamber. The building was then cleaned and disinfected, and the occupants of a neighboring block were bathed, de-loused, and given new clothing before being moved into the clean block. The process was repeated <b>until</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> barracks were disinfected. Similar disinfections were used for later epidemics of scarlet fever and other diseases, but with all the sick prisoners being sent to the gas chambers. For his efforts, Mengele was awarded the War Merit Cross (Second Class with Swords) and was promoted in 1944 to First Physician of the Birkenau subcamp.|$|E

The honour of being the first Indian recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC) in any conflict went to Khudadad Khan, 129th Duke of Connaught's Own Baluchis. When on 31 October 1914, at Hollebeke, Belgium, the British Officer in charge of the detachment having been wounded, and the other gun put out of action by a shell, Sepoy Khudadad, though himself wounded, remained working his gun <b>until</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> other five men of the gun detachment had been killed.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 1 December, 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines (3/7) engaged the PVA 175th Regiment of the 59th Division at Hill 1542 and Hill 1419. The {{tenacious}} Chinese defenders soon forced the Marines to dig in on the slopes between {{the road and the}} peaks when the convoy passed 3/7's position by the afternoon. With Hagaru-ri still not captured, the PVA High Command scrambled the 79th Division to resume attacks on Yudam-ni while the 89th Division rushed south towards Koto-ri. The Chinese struck at night, and the ferocious fighting forced the rear covering forces to call in night fighters to suppress the attacks. The fighting lasted well into {{the morning of}} 2 December <b>until</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> Marines managed to withdraw from Yudam-ni.|$|E

5|$|The {{experimental}} determination of pKa values is commonly performed {{by means of}} titrations, in a medium of high ionic strength and at constant temperature. A typical procedure would be as follows. A solution of the compound in the medium is acidified with a strong acid {{to the point where}} the compound is fully protonated. The solution is then titrated with a strong base <b>until</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> protons have been removed. At each point in the titration pH is measured using a glass electrode and a pH meter. The equilibrium constants are found by fitting calculated pH values to the observed values, using the method of least squares.|$|E
5|$|Following the explosions, the Allied advance was {{virtually}} unopposed as the Germans were too stunned and demoralised {{to put up}} much resistance. However, not everything went the Australians' way. The 3rd Division, under Major General John Monash, suffered heavy casualties when they were shelled by phosgene gas and shrapnel shells while moving towards the line of departure, nevertheless the division still managed to get into position {{for the start of}} the attack. Strong German counterattacks were launched the next day, once again supported by concentrated artillery fire; however, the advance was able to continue on through the mess of concrete blockhouses the Germans had erected and continued on <b>until</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> objectives had been taken. Australian casualties amounted to nearly 6,800 men.

5|$|New {{orders were}} {{subsequently}} issued demanding further executions. According to eyewitness accounts, the Wehrmacht went {{from house to}} house over the next several days, arresting all males between the ages of 14 and 60. They were herded into a makeshift detention centre at a former rolling-stock factory. Once there, their papers were checked and their names entered into a ledger. When the camp was full, the Wehrmacht ordered groups of 100 prisoners to march to pre-dug mass graves, where they were executed with heavy machine guns. The bodies were then examined for any signs of life; victims that had survived the initial volley were dealt a single bullet to the head. Once the first group had been liquidated, the soldiers returned to the factory and collected the next 100 victims. This process continued <b>until</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> men that were rounded up had been killed.|$|E
5|$|Slavas draft had {{increased}} {{too much to}} allow her to use the dredged channel between Hiiumaa Island and Vormsi (Worms) Island so she was ordered to wait <b>until</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> other deep-draft ships had entered the channel and then scuttle herself at the channel entrance. However, the Sailors' Committee organized on the ship after the February Revolution had ordered the engine room abandoned for fear of sinking, and she grounded on a shoal southeast of the channel because {{there was no one to}} obey the captain's order to stop. A number of destroyers evacuated the crew before the rear 12-inch magazine exploded at 11:58. However this was not deemed sufficient and three destroyers were ordered to torpedo her. Only one of their six torpedoes worked and Slava settled on the shallow bottom with a hole on the starboard side near the funnel. She was officially struck off the Navy List on 29 May 1918 by the Soviets and scrapped in 1935 by the Estonians.|$|E
5|$|When {{taking an}} audition, a judge evaluates the idol over a 30-second period. The judge's {{interest}} level continuously decreases in 10% increments, but {{this can be}} increased with another minigame. The heart points obtained up to the audition {{are used in the}} minigame as the number of times the player is given to successfully appeal to the judge <b>until</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> points are exhausted. For instance, three heart points indicates the player will have three chances to increase a judge's interest level. At the end of the audition, a judge's interest level determines if the idol passes or not. If an idol passes the audition, he or she is chosen to do a televised performance of the song previously chosen. A performance serves to increase an idol's number of fans, which in turn can increase an idol's rank if enough fans have been obtained for a given rank. For example, an idol starts at rank F with below 10,000 fans, and the next level up is a rank E with between 10,001 and 99,999 fans. The ranks continue from D to C, B, A and finally S.|$|E
