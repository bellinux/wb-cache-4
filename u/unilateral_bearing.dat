40|$|The most logical {{solution}} if {{a person}} has a hearing impairment on both ears, seems to be bilateral bearing aid amplification in both ears. Numerous studies have shown the advantages of this fitting strategy. However, there were always some individuals not benefiting from bilateral hearing aids; until recently a neglected group of persons. The {{first part of the}} present work examines patterns of usage of bilateral hearing aids and situations where the users benefit most from bilateral hearing aids. Measurements of speech recognition in noise and localization with two, one and no bearing aids were performed. The second part of this work concentrates on persons rejecting bilateral bearing aids because of unspecified reasons, not related to practical or technical issues. Paper I describes an enquiry-based, retrospective study with questions on experienced advantages and disadvantages of bilateral hearing aids as well as the pattern in which the hearing aids were used. A majority of the 144 persons participating in the survey used bilateral bearing aids. Two hearing aids were mainly appreciated in complex listening situations with high demands on speech recognition. Improved sound quality {{was one of the reasons}} to use two rather than one hearing aid. The users of two bearing aids described better localization abilities than users of one hearing aid. lit the second study, paper II, 19 bilaterally hearing-impaired persons, provided with two hearing aids, participated in psychoacoustical measurements of speech recognition in noise and localization. Both measurements showed an advantage for bilateral hearing aids. Localization could not be improved beyond the score, that the participants reached without hearing aids, but the level of localization could at least he retained with two hearing aids whereas it deteriorated with a <b>unilateral</b> <b>bearing</b> aid. In the study described in paper III, methods to measure individual auditory performance with focus on binaural aspects of the auditory system were put together. An evaluation with normal-hearing subjects showed significantly different results for measurements of speech recognition in noise and signal analysis abilities under monaural and binaural listening conditions. A measurement of central auditory and cognitive function also was included in this evaluation. The final step of this work, paper IV, was the application of the methods developed in paper III on two groups of hearing- impaired persons, one group appreciating bilateral hearing aids, one group rejecting them and using unilateral amplification instead. The study had a diagnostic approach with all measurements performed unaided. Significant differences between the two groups were found in central auditory performance and cognition with an advantage for the group benefiting from bilateral hearing aids. To a less degree, also peripheral hearing might be degraded in the group preferring one bearing aid and they also might have been provided with too much amplification in their hearing aids. The binaural performance was about the same in both groups. This work has shown, in which situations it is advantageous to use bilateral bearing aids. Tests have been identified to provide better understanding and diagnostic possibilities for hearing-impaired persons, who are not able to benefit from bilateral amplification...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} whether gender, femoral head size, acetabular inclination, and time since surgery predicted high blood metal ion concentrations following Birmingham Hip Resurfacing (BHR). BHR patients with <b>unilateral</b> <b>bearings</b> at one specialist centre with blood cobalt and chromium concentrations measured up to May 2013 were included. This comprised a mixed (at-risk) group including symptomatic patients and asymptomatic individuals with specific clinical and/or radiological findings. Blood sampling {{was at a}} mean of 7. 5 years (range 1 - 15. 4 years) postoperatively. Of 319 patients (mean age 49. 3 years; 53 % male), blood metal ions greater than 7 µg/l were observed in 9 % (n = 28). Blood metal ions were significantly higher in females (pandlt; 0. 001), femoral head sizes ≤ 48 mm (pandlt; 0. 01), and cup inclinations andgt; 55 ° (pandlt; 0. 001). Linear regression demonstrated femoral head size {{was responsible for the}} highest proportion of variance in blood metal ions (cobalt pandlt; 0. 001, R 2 = 8 %; chromium pandlt; 0. 001, R 2 = 11 %). Analysis of femoral head size and inclination together demonstrated 36 % of BHRs with head sizes of 38 - 44 mm and inclination andgt; 55 ° had blood metal ions andgt; 7 µg/l. BHR 10 -year survival for this at-risk group was 91 % (95 % confidence intervals 86. 0 %- 95. 0 %) with 30 hips revised. If blood metal ions are used to screen hip resurfacing patients for adverse reactions to metal debris it is recommended those with small femoral head sizes (38 - 44 mm) and high acetabular inclinations (andgt; 55 °) are targeted. These findings require validation in other cohorts as they may not be applicable to all hip resurfacing devices given the differences in radial clearance, coverage arc, and metallurgy...|$|R

40|$|To {{avoid the}} {{problems}} associated with twinning in dairy cattle, one of the embryos may be eliminated. This study compares the effect on pregnancy maintenance of two embryo reduction techniques, manual rupture (MR) and transvaginal ultrasound-guided aspiration (TUGA) of allanto-amniotic fluid, in Holstein-Friesian cows with multiple pregnancies. In the first experiment, 61 lactating cows <b>bearing</b> <b>unilateral</b> twins (n= 27), bilateral twins (n= 30) or triplets/quadruplets (n= 4) were subjected to MR (n= 45) or TUGA using a 17 -G neddle (n= 16) on day 28 - 34 of gestation. In 21 and 10 cows undergoing MR and TUGA embryo reduction, respectively, pregnancy loss occurred before day 90 (46. 7 vs. 62. 5 %, P= 0. 28). Through binary logistic regression, the type of pregnancy was identified as the only variable significantly affecting pregnancy maintenance (P= 0. 03). Based on the odds ratio, the risk of pregnancy loss was 4. 1 times higher for unilateral twins than for bilateral twins (70. 4 vs. 36. 7 %, respectively, P= 0. 01). No effect was detected on pregnancy maintenance of the technique used (P= 0. 17) or of the interaction technique by type of pregnancy (P= 0. 22). In the second experiment, a 22 -G needle was used to perform TUGA on 22 lactating cows. The pregnancy loss rates were 44. 4 % (4 / 9), 18. 2 % (2 / 11) and 50 % (1 / 2) for cows <b>bearing</b> <b>unilateral</b> twins, bilateral twins and triplets, respectively. The total pregnancy loss rate following TUGA using the 22 -G needle tended to be lower than that using the 17 -G needle (31. 8 vs. 62. 5 %; P= 0. 06). Our results suggest that TUGA using a 22 -G needle could be the method of choice to perform embryo reduction in cows carrying multiple pregnancies...|$|R
40|$|The main {{strategy}} in experimental and clinical neural transplantation in Parkinson’s disease {{has been to}} place fetal nigral grafts not in their ontogenic site (substantia nigra) but in their target area (striatum). The reason for this ectopic placement is the apparent inability of nigral grafts placed in the ventral mesencephalon (VM) of the adult host to grow axons for long distances {{that are capable of}} reaching the ipsilateral striatum and thus restoring the nigrostriatal pathway. The present study demonstrates {{for the first time that}} simultaneous dopaminergic transplants (double grafts) placed in the substantia nigra and ipsilateral striatum of rats <b>bearing</b> <b>unilateral</b> 6 -hydroxydopamine lesions reconstruct the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway in the adult rat brain.

40|$|The {{potential}} of a new, potent, irreversible and selective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase type B, (E) - 2 -(3, 4 -dimethoxyphenyl) - 3 -fluorallyamine (MDL 72145), to augment the effects of L-DOPA in an animal model which reproduces the biochemical defect of Parkinson's disease has been evaluated. In rats <b>bearing</b> <b>unilateral</b> 6 -hydroxydopamine lesions of the nigro-striatal dopamine pathways, both MDL 72145 and clorgyline, a selective inhibitor of MAO A, augmented the contralateral turning response to L-DOPA combined with carbidopa. The {{potential of}} inhibitors of MAO to interact adversely in the periphery with L-DOPA was investigated in the pithed rat; L-DOPA was given either intravenously or intraduodenally. Clorgyline consistently potentiated L-DOPA when given 18 h before testing. Neither MDL 72145 nor the selective inhibitor of MAO B, L-deprenyl, augmented the cardiovascular effects of intraduodenally administered L-DOPA. The data provide no reason to suppose that MDL 72145 would be very different in clinical use from L-deprenyl which is both effective and well-tolerated {{as an adjunct to}} the L-DOPA-based therapy of Parkinson's disease...|$|R
40|$|Visuo-spatial deficits are {{the most}} {{consistently}} reported cognitive abnormalities in Parkinson’s disease (PD), and they are frequently associated to motor symptoms {{in the early stages}} of the disease when dopamine loss is moderate and still restricted to the caudate– putamen. The metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR 5) antagonist, 2 -methyl- 6 -(phenylethynyl) -pyridine (MPEP), has beneficial effects on motor symptoms in animal models of PD. However, the effects of MPEP on the cognitive deficits of the disease have never been investigated. Thus, the purpose of this study was to explore its therapeutic potentials by investigating its effects on the visuo-spatial deficits induced by 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) lesions of dorsal striatum in CD 1 mice. The results demonstrated that systemic injections of MPEP (6, 12, and 24 mg/kg, i. p.) impair visuo-spatial discrimination in intact mice at high concentrations, whereas lower doses (1. 5 and 3 mg/kg, i. p.) were void of effects. Nevertheless, when an ineffective dose (MPEP 3 mg/kg) was injected, either acutely or subchronically (8 days), it antagonized the visuo-spatial discrimination deficit induced by bilateral dopamine lesion of the striatum. Furthermore, the same treatment increased contralateral turning induced by L-DOPA in mice <b>bearing</b> <b>unilateral</b> 6 -OHDA lesion. These results confirm the therapeutic potential of mGluR 5 blockade on motor symptoms induced by reduced striatal dopamine function...|$|R
40|$|The {{posterior}} bed nuclei of the stria terminalis (BST) {{are important}} neural substrate for relaying limbic influences to the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus to inhibit hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis responses to emotional stress. Androgen receptor-expressing cells within the posterior BST {{have been identified}} as projecting to the PVN region. To test a role for androgen receptors in the posterior BST to inhibit PVN motor neurons, we compared the effects of the non-aromatizable androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the androgen receptor antagonist hydroxyflutamide (HF), or a combination of both drugs implanted unilaterally within the posterior BST. Rats <b>bearing</b> <b>unilateral</b> implants were analyzed for PVN Fos induction in response to acute-restraint stress and relative levels of corticotrophin-releasing hormone and arginine vasopressin (AVP) mRNA. Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) 65 and GAD 67 mRNA were analyzed in the posterior BST to test a local involvement of GABA. There were no changes in GAD expression to support a GABA-related mechanism in the BST. For PVN neuropeptide expression and Fos responses, basic effects were lateralized to the sides of the PVN ipsilateral to the implants. However, opposite to our expectations of an inhibitory influence of androgen receptors in the posterior BST, PVN AVP mRNA and stress-induced Fos were augmented in response to DHT and attenuated in response to HF. These results suggest that a subset of androgen receptor-expressing cells within the posterior BST region may be responsible for increasing the biosynthetic capacity and stress-induced drive of PVN motor neurons...|$|R
40|$|In rats <b>bearing</b> <b>unilateral</b> 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) lesions of the dopaminergic nigro-striatal neurons, {{a single}} {{administration}} of a D- 2 agonist (LY 17155) potentiates the contralateral turning induced by a D- 1 agonist (SKF 38393). To identify the neural substrate {{of this form}} of sensitization (priming), we studied the local cerebral glucose utilization (ICMR(glc)) in 6 -OHDA lesioned animals treated, 3 days apart, as follows: (1) saline-saline, (2) LY 171555 -saline, (3) saline-SKF 38393 and (4) LY 171555 -SKF 38393. The unilateral 6 -OHDA lesion per se (Sal-Sal) produced increases in ICMR(glc) in the globus pallidus (GP) and in the lateral habenula (LH) of the lesioned hemisphere. ICMR(glc) in LY-Sal group {{were similar to those}} measured in the Sal-Sal group. Administration of SKF 38393 to drug-naive rats (Sal-SKF) abolished the lesion-induced metabolic asymmetry in the LH but did not have any effect on the GP; furthermore, it increased ICMR(glc) in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) of the lesioned side. After priming with LY 171555, administration of SKF 38393 (LY-SKF) produced marked metabolic asymmetries by increasing ICMR(glc) in the SNr and entopeduncular nucleus (EP), and decreasing it in the LH of the lesioned side. These changes were also significant when compared to the corresponding values of the other experimental groups. Again, in LY-SKF group no modification of the lesion-induced metabolic asymmetry in the GP was found. These results indicate that priming exerts a facilitatory influence on the ability of D- 1 receptors to stimulate the striato-nigral and striato-entopeduncular pathway, suggesting that changes in the effectiveness of dopamine in activating its postsynaptic target elements might contribute to the mechanism of sensitization to drugs stimulating dopaminergic transmission...|$|R
40|$|Functional {{consequences}} of pharmacological and toxicological manipulations of the dopaminergic systems {{were evaluated by}} means of the 2 -[C- 14]deoxyglucose (DG) method for measuring local rates of cerebral glucose utilization. Administration of dopamine agonist drugs modifies glucose metabolism in selected brain areas. Several factors, such as the compound used, the dose, length, and modality of the treatment, and the interval of time between the end of the treatment and the measurement of glucose utilization, contribute to define the topography and intensity of the changes. The differences refer to distinct activation of subtypes of dopamine receptors, to secondary involvement of other neurotransmitter receptor systems, and to modification of the receptor sensitivity occurring during the treatment. Other variables that interfere with the motivated behavior induced by psychostimulants may also affect the metabolic pattern. A few changes in glucose utilization are, however, common to most dopamine agonist drugs. High doses, which induce stereotypic behavior, produce metabolic changes in the extrapyramidal system. Low doses of psychostimulants, which elicit locomotion and exploratory behavior and produce reinforcement, increase glucose metabolism in the limbic system, particularly in the nucleus accumbens. Metabolic mapping in monkeys bearing 1 -methyl- 4 -phenyl- 1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydropyridine-induced lesions of the dopaminergic areas in the brainstem contributed to define the key role of the striatopallidal pathway in the production and maintenance of the motor abnormalities that characterize parkinsonism. Metabolic patterns associated with unilateral 6 -hydroxydopamine lesion of the nigrostriatal neurons in the rat are modified by dopamine agonist drugs. Specific changes are produced by selective D 1 or D 2 agonists. In rats <b>bearing</b> <b>unilateral</b> 6 -hydroxydopamine lesion, the DG method also revealed functional effects produced by the interaction between D 1 and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors...|$|R
40|$|In adult rats <b>bearing</b> <b>unilateral</b> 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) lesions of the {{ascending}} dopaminergic neurons, {{a single}} administration of a dopamine (DA) receptor agonist results in strong sensitization (''priming'') of contralateral turning {{in response to}} D 2 and particularly Dl receptor agonists. In order to investigate the role of distinct environmental cues associated with {{the effect of the}} agonist during exposure to the primer, rats <b>bearing</b> 15 -day-old <b>unilateral</b> 6 -OHDA lesions were primed in their home cage with L-dopa or with saline. L-Dopa but not saline induced medium to low but steady contralateral turning. Three days later, challenge with the D 1 agonist SKF 38393 in the home cage also resulted in contralateral turning in the rats previously primed with L-dopa, but not in those primed with saline. In a second experiment rats lesioned with 6 -OHDA were primed in two different contexts (hemispheres versus cylinders) with a single administration of the D 2 /D 3 agonist quinpirole (LY 171555 : 0. 2 mg/kg s. c.) or saline. Three days later the rats were placed in hemispheres and tested for contraversive turning in response to saline or to SKF 38393. SKF 38393 elicited high rate contraversive turning independently of the environment where priming with quinpirole took place; on the other hand no conditioned contraversive turning was observed after saline. In a third experiment, the possibility of priming SKF 38393 -induced turning by stimulation of nigral or striatal DA receptors was investigated. Rats lesioned unilaterally with 6 -OHDA were locally infused on the lesioned side in the substantia nigra with SKF 38393 or in the striatum with quinpirole. Both these treatments elicited contralateral turning, the intranigral injection of SKF 38393 eliciting a stronger and longer lasting contraversive turning than intrastriatal quinpirole. Challenge with SKF 38393 (3 mg/kg s. c.) 3 days later induced contralateral turning only in rats previously primed with intrastriatal quinpirole. The results of these studies are consistent with the idea that ''priming'' is an example of non-associative sensitization induced by stimulation of denervated striatal DA receptors and expressed as an increased efficiency of post-synaptic dopaminergic transduction in the striatum...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the relationship between unilateral squat strength and measures of static balance to compare balance performance between the dominant and non-dominant leg. Seventeen apparently healthy men (mean mass 90. 5 ± 20. 9 kg and age 21. 7 ± 1. 8 yrs) and 25 women (mean mass 62. 2 ± 14. 5 kg and age 21. 9 ± 1. 3 yrs) completed the study. Weight <b>bearing</b> <b>unilateral</b> strength was measured with a 1 RM modified unilateral squat on the dominant and non-dominant leg. The students completed the stork stand and wobble board tests to determine static balance on the dominant and non-dominant leg. Maximum time maintained in the stork stand position, on the ball of the foot with the uninvolved foot against the involved knee with hands on the hips, was recorded. Balance was measured with a 15 second wobble board test. No significant correlations were found between the measurements of unilateral balance and strength (r values ranged between - 0. 05 to 0. 2) for the men and women. Time off balance was not significantly different between the subjects' dominant (men 1. 1 ± 0. 4 s; women 0. 3 ± 0. 1 s) and non-dominant (men 0. 9 ± 0. 3 s; women 0. 3 ± 0. 1 s) leg for the wobble board. Similar results were found for the time balanced during the stork stand test on the dominant (men 26. 4 ± 6. 3 s; women 24. 1 ± 5. 6 s) and non-dominant (men 26. 0 ± 5. 7 s; women 21. 3 ± 4. 1 s) leg. The data indicate that static balance and strength is unrelated in young adult men and women and gains made in one variable after training may not be associated with a change in performance of the other variable. These results also suggest that differences in static balance performance between legs can not be determined by leg dominance. Similar research is needed to compare contralateral leg balance in populations who participate in work or sport activities requiring repetitive asymmetrical use. A better understanding of contralateral balance performance will help practitioners make evaluative decisions during the rehabilitation proces...|$|R
