50|$|Pitch is the {{distance}} between a point on one tooth and the corresponding point on an adjacent tooth. It is a dimension measured along a line or curve in the transverse, normal, or axial directions. The use of the single word pitch without qualification may be ambiguous, {{and for this reason}} it is preferable to use specific designations such as <b>transverse</b> <b>circular</b> <b>pitch,</b> normal base pitch, axial pitch.|$|R

To create <b>circular</b> <b>pitch</b> class space we identify or [...] "glue together" [...] pitches p and p + 12. The result is a continuous, <b>circular</b> <b>pitch</b> class space that mathematicians call Z/12Z.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} chord finding system {{that is based on}} <b>circular</b> <b>pitch</b> spaces (CPS) {{introduced}} by Gatzsche et al. in 2008 [1] and Hidden Markov Models (HMM). The classifier HMM works with the output of the CPS that is directly calculated from the chromagram (Figure 1). The CPS displays harmonic events clearer than the common used chromagram. Therefore it is appropriate for chord analysis. Another <b>circular</b> <b>pitch</b> space – introduced in 2006 by Harte, Sandler and Gasser [2] – will be used for comparison. Several papers showed that the CPS_HSG is also useful for chord detection. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is to give an {{overview}} of existing <b>circular</b> <b>pitch</b> spaces, its special properties and application for semantic audio analysis. Beside this the symmetry model is proposed as a framework to describe the inter-model relationships between different <b>circular</b> <b>pitch</b> spaces. Similar to color spaces in vision musical pitch spaces organize pitches in a way that semantic/cognitive/theoretical/physical relationships between tones become geometrically apparent. Within the last years pitch spaces were mainly subject of music theory. But they become more and more interesting for semantic analysis of musical audio signals. Pitch spaces can be applied tokey and chord recognition, similarity calculation of musical pieces, genre estimation, tension analysis or harmonic change detection...|$|R

The method replaces the high-voltage sweep component of a conventional streak camera by a TM 110 -mode RF cavity, which performs a <b>transverse</b> <b>circular</b> sweep of the electron bunch in the streak tube through a rotating magnetic field. The proposed method also allows one to overcome the problem of triggering, which is a serious limitation of conventional streak cameras...|$|R
5000|$|Axial pitch, px : Linear {{pitch in}} an axial plane {{and in a}} pitch surface. In helical gears and worms, axial pitch has the same value at all diameters. In gearing of other types, axial pitch may be {{confined}} to the pitch surface and may be a circular measurement. The term axial pitch is preferred to the term linear pitch. The axial pitch of a helical worm and the <b>circular</b> <b>pitch</b> of its worm gear are the same.|$|R
5000|$|... where a is {{the axis}} distance, z1 and z2 are {{the number of}} cogs (teeth) {{for each of the}} two wheels (gears). These numbers (or at least one of them) is often chosen among primes to create an even contact between every cog of both wheels, and thereby avoid {{unnecessary}} wear and damage. An even uniform gear wear is achieved by ensuring the tooth counts of the two gears meshing together are relatively prime to each other; this occurs when the greatest common divisor (GCD) of each gear tooth count equals 1, e.g. GCD(16,25)=1; if a 1:1 gear ratio is desired a relatively prime gear may be inserted in between the two gears; this maintains the 1:1 ratio but reverses the gear direction; a second relatively prime gear could also be inserted to restore the original rotational direction while maintaining uniform wear with all 4 gears in this case. Mechanical engineers, at least in continental Europe, usually use the module instead of <b>circular</b> <b>pitch.</b> The module, just like the <b>circular</b> <b>pitch,</b> can be used for all types of cogs, not just evolvent based straight cogs.|$|R
50|$|Hydrostatic skeletons are {{typically}} {{arranged in a}} cylinder. Hydrostatic skeletons can be controlled by several different muscle types. Length can be adjusted by longitudinal muscle fibers parallel to the longitudinal axis. The muscle fibers {{may be found in}} continuous sheets or isolated bundles, and the diameter can be manipulated by three different muscle types: <b>circular,</b> radial, and <b>transverse.</b> <b>Circular</b> musculature wraps around the circumference of the cylinder, radial musculature extends {{from the center of the}} cylinder towards the surface, and transverse musculature arrange in parallel and perpendicular sheets crossing the diameter of the cylinder.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel method for detecting harmonic boundaries in musical audio signals. These boundaries are very useful for chord analysis because they define temporal chord limits. This harmonic change driven (event driven) analysis of musical audio signals {{is a better}} basis for a following chord analysis than the traditionally frame based only concept. The method itself works with <b>circular</b> <b>pitch</b> spaces (CPS). CPSs summarize high level aspects of the audio signal like semantic and music theoretical relationships. Using CPSs entails good results in detecting harmonic changes...|$|R

There are two teams of 8 players; one on one raid; and no player leaves the field. If 2 stopers attack a player, a foul is declared.

50|$|Standard profile angles are {{established}} {{in connection with}} standard proportions of gear teeth and standard gear cutting tools. Involute gears operate together correctly after a change of center distance, and gears designed for a different center distance can be generated correctly by standard tools. A change of center distance is accomplished by changes in operating values for <b>pitch</b> diameter, <b>circular</b> <b>pitch,</b> diametral pitch, pressure angle, and tooth thicknesses or backlash. The same involute gear may be used under conditions that change its operating pitch diameter and pressure angle. Unless {{there is a good}} reason for doing otherwise, it is practical to consider that the pitch and the profile angle of a single gear correspond to the pitch and the profile angle of the hob or cutter used to generate its teeth.|$|R

Three T-beams with circular openings tested earlier by the authors have been chosen, and a strut-and-tie model was constructed for each beam. A comparison of the theoretical predictions concerning the ultimate strength, mode of failure and the proportion of applied shear carried by the chord members above and below the opening show good agreement with test results. The truss model also explains clearly the role of diagonal reinforcement in relieving concrete distress at the throat section by transferring a significant amount of applied shear across the discontinuity...|$|R
50|$|The muscles {{perpendicular}} to the long axis may be arranged in a <b>transverse,</b> <b>circular,</b> or radial pattern. A transverse arrangement involves sheets of muscle fibers running {{perpendicular to}} the long axis, usually alternating between horizontal and vertical orientations.

A radial arrangement involves fibers radiating out in all directions {{from the center of the}} organ. This is found in the tentacles of the chambered nautilus and in the elephant proboscis (trunk). A circular arrangement has rings of contractive fibers around the long axis. This is found in many mammalian and lizard tongues along with squid tentacles.|$|R
