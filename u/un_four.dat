40|$|International audienceThe {{excavations}} of {{the workshop}} of amphorae at Demirci, 15 kilometers south of Sinope, have clarified the morphology of Roman kilns {{in the region and}} established the typology of Sinopean amphorae produced between the 2 nd or 3 rd century and the 6 th or 7 th century AD. Monitoring the exports of these amphorae in other sites of the Black Sea, the Mediterranean, and even Italy, has highlighted the important commercial network of Sinope. This work has helped to develop other projects and research activities. In collaboration with the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, a kiln identical to those excavated at Demirci was reconstructed by students of Bilkent University. It is exhibited in the gallery devoted to the French-Turkish excavations {{of the workshop}}s. In 2009, an International Symposium held in Sinope focused on recent research concerning this city, while a series of international Round Tables, PATABS (Production and Trade of the Black Sea Amphorae), was initiated in Trabzon and Batumi in 2006. Finally, a new project is in preparation: the creation of a Corpus of amphorae produced in the Black Sea during the Roman period and kept in the museums of the northern coast of Turkey. Les fouilles de l'atelier amphorique de Demirci, à 15 kilomètres au sud de Sinope, ont permis de connaître la morphologie des fours romains de cette région et d'établir la typologie des amphores sinopéennes produites entre le 2 e ou 3 e s. et le 6 e ou 7 e s. pC Le suivi des exportations de ces amphores dans d'autres sites de mer Noire, en Méditerranée et même en Italie, a mis en valeur l'important réseau commercial de Sinope. D'autres recherches et projets se sont greffées à ces travaux en collaboration avec le Ministère de la Culture et du Tourisme, <b>un</b> <b>four</b> à l'identique de ceux fouillés à Demirci a été reconstruit par les étudiants de l'Université de Bilkent.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} bubble formation and growth at 1 atmosphere, degassing experiments using a Stromboli basalt with dissolved H 2 O or H 2 O + CO 2 were {{performed in a}} custom furnace on a beamline at the Advanced Photon Source. The glasses were synthesized at 1250 °C and 1000 MPa, with ~ 3. 0 wt%, ~ 5. 0 wt%, or ~ 7. 0 wt% H 2 O or with mixtures of H 2 O + CO 2, ~ 3. 0 wt% H 2 O and ~ 440 ppm CO 2, ~ 5. 0 wt% H 2 O and 880 ppm CO 2, ~ 7. 0 wt% H 2 O and ~ 1480 ppm CO 2, then heated on the beamline while recording the bubble growth. The 3 D bubble size distributions in the quenched samples were then studied with synchrotron X-ray microtomography. The experimental results show that bubble nucleation and growth are volatile-concentration dependent. Bubbles can easily nucleate in melts initially containing high volatile concentrations. CO 2 has no significant effect on bubble formation and growth because of low CO 2 concentrations. Multiple nucleation events occur {{in most of these}} degassing samples, and they are more pronounced in more supersaturated melts. Bubble growth is initially controlled by viscosity near glass transition temperatures and by diffusion at higher temperatures where melt viscous relaxation occurs rapidly. Bubble foam forms when bubbles are highly connected due to coalescence, and bubbles begin pop, 10 to 20 seconds after the foam is developed. The degree of bubble coalescence increases with time, and bubble coalescence can significantly change the bubble size distribution. Bubble size distributions follow power-law relations at vesicularities of 1. 0 % to 65 %, and bubble size distributions evolve from power-law relations to exponential relations at vesicularities of 65 % to 83 %. This evolution is associated with the change from far-from-equilibrium degassing to near-equilibrium degassing. The experimental results imply that during basaltic eruptions both far-from-equilibrium degassing and near-equilibrium degassing can occur. The far-from-equilibrium degassing generally generates the power-law bubble size distributions whereas the near-equilibrium degassing produces exponential bubble size distributions Bubbles begin to pop when the vesicularities attain 65 % to 83 %. Bubble expansion in the foam possibly accounts for the mechanism of magma fragmentation.

40|$|Die Ausgrabung eines großen Töpferofens 3 km von Béziers bot die Gelegenheit, eine Struktur zu untersuchen, die dem Brennen von pithoi diente. Der Ofen war zwischen dem Ende des 6. Jh. v. Chr. und der ersten Hälfte des 4. Jh. v. Chr. in Betrieb. Es scheint sich um den einzigen Ofen mit dieser Funktion zu handeln, der im westlichen Mittelmeerraum freigelegt wurde. Der Ofen war groß, die schwere Sohle wurde in der Feuerkammer durch eine Vorrichtung aus zwei seitlichen, durch Kragbogen mit einem zentralen Stützmäuerchen verbundene Pfeiler gestützt. Für diesen technisch sehr ausgefeilten Ofen gibt es in Gallien nur eine Parallele in Marseille (in diesem Ofen wurden Amphoren gebrannt). Diese so ungewöhnliche Werkstatt bestätigt die Rolle, die Béziers drei Jahrhunderte lang in der Keramikproduktion gespielt hat, und bietet zudem Gelegenheit auf einen für Flüssigkeiten bestimmten Gefäßtyp zurückzukommen (sowohl in Marseille als auch in Béziers diente er u. a. der Weinbereitung), der sich jedoch ebenfalls für andere Inhalte eignete. Dieser Gefäßtyp wurde in Gallien von den Griechen eingeführt und wurde im westlichen Mittelmeerraum vor allem ab dem Beginn des 4. Jh. v. Chr. geläufig. Entgegen einer weit verbreiteten Vorstellung war die Herstellung dieser großen Gefäße komplex und konnte nur in spezialisierten Werkstätten in der Nähe der Rohstoffvorkommen (Ton, Wasser, Holz, Sand und Kies) stattfinden. Die Ateliers lagen darüber hinaus in der Nähe eines Verkehrsweges, der ebenso der Beförderung der Rohstoffe als auch der Fertigprodukte diente. The {{excavation}} {{of a large}} pottery kiln at 3 km from Béziers allowed to study a structure destined for firing of pithoi. The kiln functioned {{between the end of}} the 6 th century B. C. and {{the first half of the}} 4 th century B. C.; it seems that it is the only example devoted to this function discovered in the West Mediterranean. It was large and in the fire-chamber the supporting device of the heavy hearth was constituted of two lateral pillars joining a central low wall by corbelled arches. Carefully worked out this kiln can only be compared to another one for amphorae in Gaul discovered in Marseille. So peculiar, it confirms that Béziers was a centre of pottery production during near three centuries. The opportunity is given for a review of this kind of liquid vessel (used for vinification in Massilia as in Béziers) but also suited for other contents. Introduced in Gaul by Greeks, this vase became common in western Mediterranean, mainly from the early 4 th century B. C. The production of these large vessels, on the contrary of the generally accepted idea, was complex and made only in specialized workshops established near the spot of raw materials (clay, water, wood, sand and gravel) nearby a road for the carriage of goods and resources.

40|$|Divers modèles, ayant pour but de prédire le taux d'imbrûlés solides lors de la {{combustion}} du fuel lourd, ont été mis au point dans le passé. Les paramètres entrant en ligne de compte sont le plus souvent les teneurs en résidus lourds hydrocarbonés (asphaltènes précipités au pentane ou à l'heptane et carbone Conradson) et en métaux : c'est le cas des modèles Exxon et Shell développés respectivement en 1979 et 1981. D'autres modèles tiennent compte, {{en plus de}} la composition du fuel, de son mode d'atomisation, de son mode de diffusion dans le foyer et de la cinétique de combustion : on peut citer les travaux du Laboratoire Energie du MIT publiés en 1986. Néanmoins, ces facteurs ne sont pas les seuls à intervenir : l'expérience a montré que l'état de dispersion des asphaltènes peut jouer également un grand rôle, notamment dans le cas d'installations de combustion à injection mécanique, pour lesquelles la dispersion des gouttelettes n'est pas aussi fine que pour des installations munies d'une injection assistée par la vapeur. Cette influence de la dispersion des asphaltènes sur la combustion a été mise en évidence dans le passé par l'utilisation d'additifs dispersants et également par la combustion de fuels lourds constitués par dilution d'asphaltes précipités au pentane avec un gas-oil de cracking catalytique de raffinerie (LCO). Ce sont ces fuels que l'on a considérés dans la présente étude. L'effet de ce facteur dispersion n'a pas été quantifié jusqu'alors, la difficulté étant de définir une grandeur mesurable représentant la répartition des agglomérats d'asphaltènes. Dans cette étude, on a essayé en un premier temps de faire une approche fractale de la répartition des asphaltènes à partir de clichés (préparés par la société Total), cette méthode ayant déjà été utilisée avec succès pour décrire des structures d'aspects comparables. Malheureusement, on s'est heurté à des difficultés relevant du mode d'exploration et de la non adéquation entre les structures asphalténiques et fractales. On a finalement opté pour une détermination visuelle s'appuyant sur les clichés sur lesquels les agglomérats d'asphaltènes sont clairement visualisés tels qu'ils sont dans le fuel. Ce mode d'exploration laborieux a cependant permis de déterminer un modèle construit sur une série de 25 fuels dont 10 ont été brûlés sur une chaudière de 2 MW, et 15 sur <b>un</b> <b>four</b> de 100 kW. Ce modèle fait intervenir les teneurs en carbone Conradson et en métaux, ainsi que le taux de dispersion des asphaltènes. Le perfectionnement des moyens d'exploration aidant, on peut s'attendre à ce que soient disponibles des techniques d'évaluation de la dispersion sur les clichés. Ce paramètre pourra alors être pris en considération pour une meilleure prédiction de résultats de combustion insuffisamment expliqués avec les paramètres classiques. Various models {{aiming to}} predict the amount of unburned particles (solids) during heavy fuel-oil combustion have been developed. The parameters taken into consideration are generally asphaltenes precipitated by normal heptane or pentane and Conradson carbon {{as well as the}} metals content having a known catalytic effect on cenosphere combustion in the combustion chamber. The Exxon and Shell models can be mentioned, which were developed respectively in 1979 and 1981 (Chapter II). Other models also give consideration to the fuel-oil composition, the way it is atomized and diffused in the chamber and the combustion kinetics (research done by the MIT Energy Laboratory published in 1986). However, the above parameters {{are not the only ones}} involved. For some fuel oils, experience has shown that the state of dispersion of asphaltenes may also play an important role particularly for combustion installations with mechanical injection for which the dispersion of fuel-oil droplets is not very great and does not affect the structures built up by asphaltene aggregates. This influence of asphaltene dispersion on combustion was revealed in the past by the use of dispersant additives, and more recently in the combustion of heavy fuel oils made up by the dilution of pentane-precipited asphalts with a light cycle oil (LCO). These fuel oils are considered in this article because a divergence has been found between prediction and the measurement of solid unburned hydrocarbons as the result of a more or less dispersed state of asphaltenes, depending on the conditions of diluted-asphalt preparation with a fixed fuel oil/LCO ratio. The goal has thus been to add on a term representative of this state of dispersion to the terms normally considered (asphaltenes, Conradson carbon, metals). To assess the state of dispersion of asphaltenes in fuel oils, pictures implying a special preparation of sample (taken by Total) were examined. These photos give a fairly representative picture of aggregate distribution in the fuel oil. To assess this dispersion, a fractal approach, which had already been applied successfully to describe structures with comparable aspects, was tried, but we came up against difficulties stemming from the exploration method and from the unmatching of asphaltenic and fractal structures. We finally chose a visual determination based on the photos in which the asphaltene agglomerates are clearly represented as they occur in the fuel oil (set of photos in the article). This laborious exploration method (liable to be replaced by image-scanning software) nevertheless enabled a more complete model to be designed for this type of production. This model was based on a serie of 25 fuel oils, ten of which were burned in a 2 MW boiler and 15 in a 100 IkW furnace. The characteristics of these fuel oils are given in Table I. The designations tau s and tau v represent the rates of surface and volume dispersion of the fuel oils expressed respectively in agg/µm² and agg/µm 3 (agg = agglomerates). Table II has to do with the nature of the fuel oils used (origin of the crude and method of preparation). The prospection methodology in creating the overall model is diagramed in a flowchart. The two series of fuel oils were burned respectively in a 2 MW boiler and a 100 kW furnace. The aim was to reduce them to a single serie of 25 measurement so that the model would have greater significance. The particles emission between the two installations were appreciably different, and so they had to be made comparable by a passage equationbetween the actual values obtained for the 2 MW boiler and the fictive values predicted by the intermediate model used (model of the 100 kW furnace). With the help of the passage equation, we were thus able to build a model on all the data. The model concerning the 100 kW furnace was taken as the intermediate model, and thus the values predicted by the overall model are directly applicable to the 100 kW furnace. However, the reverse passage equationhad to be applied to the fictive predicted values for the 2 MW boiler to obtain the particle emission corresponding to this latter installation...|$|E
