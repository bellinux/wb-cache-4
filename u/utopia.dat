5|$|In the 1970s and 1980s <b>Utopia</b> became {{well known}} for the design and {{production}} of batiks. By 1981 there were 50artists at <b>Utopia</b> creating batik works; 88 artists participated in a major design project supported by the Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association. Although several sources comment that artistic activity at <b>Utopia</b> began with batik and only later moved to painting, they do not state whether or not Minnie was a textile artist before she took up the brush. The National Gallery of Victoria's brief biography suggests {{that she did not}} participate in the making of batik, but she was aware of it.|$|E

The impacts of <b>utopias</b> on housing typologies are argued as well. The study is undertaken in two major parts. Firstly, housing typologies which are proposed from different <b>utopias</b> are introduced then the <b>utopias</b> and the housing typologies which are generated especially for the city of Ankara are evaluated. As a result it is seen that the aim of <b>utopias</b> are to find out the ideal conditions for social, cultural and economical structure. In this context some clues are explored how <b>utopias</b> shape the cities and housing...|$|R

5|$|Gilbert's aggressive, though successful, {{legal action}} had embittered Carte and Sullivan, but the {{partnership}} {{had been so}} profitable that Carte and his wife eventually sought to reunite the author and composer. After several attempts by the Cartes, the reconciliation finally came {{through the efforts of}} Tom Chappell, who published the sheet music to their operas. In 1893, Gilbert and Sullivan produced their penultimate collaboration, <b>Utopia,</b> Limited. While <b>Utopia</b> was being prepared, Carte produced Jane Annie, by J. M. Barrie and Arthur Conan Doyle, with music by Ernest Ford. Despite the popularity of Barrie and Conan Doyle, the show was a flop, closing after only 51 performances.|$|E

5|$|<b>Utopia,</b> Limited (1893), their {{penultimate}} opera, was a {{very modest}} success, and their last, The Grand Duke (1896), was an outright failure. Neither work entered the canon of regularly performed Gilbert and Sullivan works until the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company made the first complete professional recordings of the two operas in the 1970s. Gilbert had also offered Sullivan another libretto, His Excellency (1894), but Gilbert's insistence on casting Nancy McIntosh, his protege from <b>Utopia,</b> led to Sullivan's refusal, and His Excellency was instead composed by F. Osmond Carr. Meanwhile, the Savoy Theatre continued to revive the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, in between new pieces, and D'Oyly Carte touring companies also played them in repertory.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the poet}} was {{moving away from}} Surrealism, his {{adherence}} to strict Marxism-Leninism was reportedly questioned by both the PCF and the Soviet Union. Semiotician Philip Beitchman places their attitude in connection with Tzara's own vision of <b>Utopia,</b> which combined communist messages with Freudo-Marxist psychoanalysis and made use of particularly violent imagery. Reportedly, Tzara refused to be enlisted in supporting the party line, maintaining his independence and refusing to take the forefront at public rallies.|$|E
40|$|This Paper uses pragmatist {{thinking}} {{to reconsider the}} status of utopian projects. The argument begins by noting the defensive attitudes of many utopian advocates. This defensiveness appears due to two sentiments: that many political movements remain hostile to utopias; and that the capacity of societies to generate new <b>utopias</b> may be declining. Focussing on the latter assertion, the argument notes that many <b>utopias</b> remain uncounted, so how is falling generative capacity to be gauged? It is asserted instead that the capacity of societies to generate new <b>utopias</b> remains undimmed. Yet, both the mechanisms through which utopian production is done, and the qualities of the <b>utopias</b> themselves need further deciphering {{if they are not}} to be overlooked. This argument builds on Gardiner’s (2004) idea of everyday utopianism, reinterpreted using the network pragmatism associated with Latour (1999). Through this lens, two examples of the playing out of everyday <b>utopias</b> are explored. These relate to ongoing extensions of democratic representation to non-humans; and to increasingly assertive claims to moral conduct in making war through autonomising machines. Using the lessons of these examples, four qualification requirements for a network pragmatist reading of everyday <b>utopias</b> are generated and contrasted with conventional <b>utopias.</b> These qualifications relate to: grandeur, reflexivity, normalisation and extensionism. Taken together, these qualification requirements may function as a specific test for <b>utopias</b> to counter ubiquitous market tests and support a specifically utopian ontological politics...|$|R
40|$|The diploma thesis characterizes and interprets {{negative}} <b>utopias</b> of the inter-war and post-war periods. In methodical terms, {{the thesis}} {{is based on}} the theory of representation, negative <b>utopias</b> are viewed as the products of the affairs and thinking of the period. The objective of this thesis is to contemplate in what manner the inter-war and post-war negative <b>utopias</b> reflected the discussions and ideas of the world, society and humans at that time. The Czechoslovakian <b>utopias</b> of inter-war and post-war period are considered {{in the context of the}} times. Individual chapter analyse the relation of the anti-utopian genre and the horizon of thoughts of the period. The diploma thesis asks in what manner negative <b>utopias</b> react to the changing world as well as the war and totalitarian experiences of the twentieth century...|$|R
50|$|One common {{trend in}} feminist science fiction <b>utopias</b> is the {{existence}} of utopian worlds as single-gendered - most commonly female. In literary works female <b>utopias</b> are portrayed as free of conflict, and intentionally free of men. The single gendered <b>utopias</b> of female science fiction are free of the conflicts that feminism aims to eliminate, such as patriarchal oppression and the gender inequality inherent in patriarchal society. In a statement about these single gendered <b>utopias,</b> Joanna Russ, author of The Female Man , theorized that male-only societies were not written because in patriarchal society, male oppression is not as pressing an issue as is female oppression.|$|R
5|$|Amazon river dolphins, {{known by}} the natives as the boto or encantados, are very {{prevalent}} in the mythology of the native South Americans.

5|$|Godwin's book {{follows a}} venerable {{tradition}} of travel literature that blends {{the excitement of}} journeys to foreign places with utopian reflection; More's <b>Utopia</b> is cited as a forerunner, as is the account of Amerigo Vespucci.

40|$|Contemporary {{politics}} {{is often said}} to lack <b>utopias.</b> For prevailing understandings of the practical force of political theory, this looks like cause for celebration. As blueprints to apply to political practice, <b>utopias</b> invariably seem too strong or too weak. Through an immanent critique of political realism, I argue that utopian thought, and political theory generally, is better conceived as supplying an orientation to politics. Realists including Bernard Williams and Raymond Geuss explain how utopian programs like universal human rights poorly orient their adherents to politics, but the realists wrongly conclude that <b>utopias</b> and other ideal theories necessarily disorient us. As I show through an analysis of utopian claims made by Michel Foucault, Malcolm X, and John Rawls, <b>utopias</b> today can effectively disrupt entrenched forms of legitimation, foster new forms of political identity, and reveal new possibilities within existing institutions. <b>Utopias</b> are needed to understand the political choices we face today...|$|R

5|$|Literature {{academic}} Jayne Ashleigh Glover {{says that}} while Zone Three on the surface {{appears to be a}} feminist <b>utopia,</b> Lessing shows that it is far from idyllic. The story narrators, the Chroniclers of Zone Three, question their zone's behaviour and attitudes, and warn of the dangers of stagnation. Al•Ith, upon returning to Zone Three, is shunned by its inhabitants for failing to attend to their zone's needs, and Zone Three's stasis manifests itself in xenophobia when Al•Ith brings back new perspectives, followed by visitors from Zone Four.|$|E
5|$|Most of the overtures are {{in three}} sections: a lively introduction, a slow middle section, and a {{concluding}} allegro in sonata form, with two subjects, a brief development, a recapitulation and a coda. However, Sullivan himself {{did not always}} follow this pattern. The overture to Princess Ida, for instance, has only an opening fast section and a concluding slow section.
