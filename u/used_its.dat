5|$|By 2001, Juniper {{had made}} {{only a few}} {{acquisitions}} of smaller companies, due to the leadership's preference for organic growth. The pace of acquisition picked up in 2001 and 2002 with the purchases of Pacific Broadband and Unisphere Networks. In 2004 Juniper made a $4 billion acquisition of network security company NetScreen Technologies. Juniper revised NetScreen's channel program that year and <b>used</b> <b>its</b> reseller network to bring other products to market.|$|E

5|$|Each {{subsequent}} {{line was}} built by a different company. Rivalry often prevented any cooperation over shared facilities, and so almost every railway line into Preston <b>used</b> <b>its</b> own station.

5|$|Little {{is known}} of the {{behaviour}} of the dodo, as most contemporary descriptions are very brief. Based on weight estimates, {{it has been suggested}} the male could reach the age of 21, and the female 17. Studies of the cantilever strength of its leg bones indicate that it could run quite fast. Unlike the Rodrigues solitaire, {{there is no evidence that}} the dodo <b>used</b> <b>its</b> wings in intraspecific combat. Though some dodo bones have been found with healed fractures, it had weak pectoral muscles and more reduced wings in comparison. The dodo may instead have <b>used</b> <b>its</b> large, hooked beak in territorial disputes. Since Mauritius received more rain and had a more stable climate than Rodrigues, there was probably less need for male dodos to fight over territory. The solitaire was therefore probably the more aggressive of the two.|$|E
