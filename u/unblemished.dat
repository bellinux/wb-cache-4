5|$|Judge Kapena, {{the last}} rites to whose memory, {{have just been}} performed, was a man whose {{character}} stood <b>unblemished</b> in this nation, and whose abilities, in the various positions of life, by him occupied, were conspicuous. In his official and social relation he was admired and beloved by the Hawaiian people. and his good name will be cherished not only by his family, but by a large circle of friends.|$|E
5|$|After {{surviving}} numerous close games {{during the}} regular season, conference tournament, and most recently a triple overtime game against Michigan State in the national semifinal, North Carolina came into the National Championship game with an <b>unblemished</b> record of 310. Led by coach Frank McGuire and Helms Foundation College Basketball Player of the Year Lennie Rosenbluth, the Tar Heels were ranked first overall in the AP Poll. Kansas came into the National Championship game with two losses, which were credited to poor ball control on the Jayhawks part. The Kansas Jayhawks, led by Sophomore phenom and Firstteam All-American Wilt Chamberlain, came into the game favored to win against the Tar Heels of North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Australian National Airways (ANA) never {{recovered}} from {{the crash of the}} Amana. Since the beginning of 1945, 77 people had been killed in accidents in aircraft operated by ANA. In late 1948, ANA suffered 4 crashes in 4 months. The loss of ANA's reputation as a safe airline, together with the <b>unblemished</b> safety record and growing commercial success of its rival Trans Australia Airlines, sent ANA into decline. In 1957 ANA was taken over by Ansett Transport Industries Limited and merged with Ansett Airways to form the domestic airline Ansett-ANA.|$|E
5|$|His {{eyes are}} open, {{and his skin}} is <b>unblemished.</b> The cross is painted with deep blue paint, perhaps evoking an eternal or {{timeless}} sky. This evocation, not present in the main crucified figure, {{was known as the}} Christus triumphans ("Triumphant Christ"), and for contemporary– especially Franciscan– taste lacked verisimilitude, as it bore little relation to the actual suffering likely endured during a crucifixion, and overly distanced the divine from the human aspect of Christ. From about 1240, painters favoured the Christus patiens ("Suffering Christ") style: a saviour who shared the burden and pain of humanity. The Santa Croce Crucifix is one of the earliest and best known examples of the type.|$|E
5|$|The <b>unblemished</b> {{musculature}} of {{the central}} figure waving to the rescue ship {{is reminiscent of the}} Neoclassical, however the naturalism of light and shadow, the authenticity of the desperation shown by the survivors and the emotional character of the composition differentiate it from Neoclassical austerity. It was a further departure from the religious or classical themes of earlier works because it depicted contemporary events with ordinary and unheroic figures. Both the choice of subject matter and the heightened manner in which the dramatic moment is depicted are typical of Romantic painting—strong indications {{of the extent to which}} Géricault had moved from the prevalent Neoclassical movement.|$|E
5|$|The American Stud Book, the {{registration}} book for American Thoroughbreds, was not founded until 1873, much {{later than the}} General Stud Book, and the rules for registration required only that a horse have five generations of ancestors in the American Stud Book or other national stud books, unlike the General Stud Book rules. In addition, many breeding records were destroyed during the American Civil War, as fighting during that conflict took place in noted American Thoroughbred breeding centers. The result was that most American Thoroughbreds in 1913 were unable to show an <b>unblemished</b> pedigree according to the General Stud Book rules. Adding to the problem {{was the fact that}} American horses were beginning to win the big horse races in England, starting with Iroquois, who won the 1881 Epsom Derby.|$|E
5|$|The Order {{was open}} to men and women, and both genders were {{entitled}} companions. Until 1476, there were no limits {{on the number of}} companions to be admitted, but that year, with the new edition of the Order's statutes, the Duke limited the number of men to 60; unlimited women could be admitted. The editions of the Order's statutes, two in Latin and two in German, established similar requirements for membership. The Latin editions stipulated that the man be of noble birth—eight generations of noble grandparents—and of <b>unblemished</b> reputation; the German versions required that only four grandparents of the man be noble. Women were to be spouses of a companion; in the 1476 versions of the statutes, both Latin and German, female members of the Duchess' household could be admitted even if their husbands were not members or if the women were single, but were required to resign if they left the service of the Duchess. The exception to this clause provided for their continued membership if their husbands became companions of the order.|$|E

25|$|When it {{was instituted}} in 1848, the medal could be awarded after 21 years of <b>unblemished</b> service.

The time served requirement was finally reduced to fifteen years with effect from 1 December 1977.|$|E
25|$|From 1947 {{until the}} Royal New Zealand Air Force Long Service and Good Conduct Medal was instituted in 1985, the Royal Air Force Long Service and Good Conduct Medal was also awarded to non-commissioned {{officers}} and airmen of the Royal New Zealand Air Force who had completed {{fifteen years of}} <b>unblemished</b> service.|$|E
25|$|When it was instituted, {{the medal}} could be awarded to Regular Force warrant {{officers}}, non-commissioned officers and {{men of the}} British Army after eighteen years of <b>unblemished</b> service.

25|$|As in {{complaints}} upon witchcrafts, {{there may}} be matters of inquiry which do not amount unto matters of presumption, and {{there may be}} matters of presumption which yet may not be matters of conviction, so it is necessary, that all proceedings thereabout be managed with an exceeding tenderness towards those that may be complained of, especially if they have been persons formerly of an <b>unblemished</b> reputation.|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah, {{the central}} {{compilation}} of Rabbinic Oral Law, contains a tractate on the Red Heifer, Tractate Parah ("Cow") in Seder Tohorot, which explains the procedures involved. The tractate has no existing Gemara, although commentary on {{key elements of}} the procedure {{is found in the}} Gemarah for other tractates of the Talmud. According to Mishnah Parah, the presence of two black hairs invalidates a Red Heifer, in addition to the usual requirements of an <b>unblemished</b> animal for sacrifice.|$|E
25|$|The cars did not race {{again until}} the 1954 Le Mans race. This time three cars were entered, with uprated engines and the {{improved}} aerodynamic bodywork. In contrast with the previous year, and despite torrential rain, all three cars finished the race, coming home in first, second and third in their class and seventh, eighth and ninth overall. Their performance also earned Bristol the team prize. The 450s remained in France for the Reims race, and again demonstrated <b>unblemished</b> reliability, taking 2nd, 3rd and 4th in class, beaten only narrowly by a Ferrari for the class victory.|$|E
25|$|The Buckeyes {{had high}} {{expectations}} again entering the 1996 contest. They boasted an <b>unblemished</b> 10–0 record and were ranked #2 {{in the nation}} {{as they entered the}} finale with 7–3 Michigan. When Ohio State jumped to a 9–0 halftime lead, the OSU crowd sensed a special finish and perhaps a rise to #1. The Wolverines' defense shut the Buckeyes out in the second half while Brian Griese replaced the struggling Scott Dreisbach and led Michigan to 13 unanswered points and another victory over their rivals, 13–9. The game {{would turn out to be}} the Buckeyes' only loss of the season and ended up costing them a chance of the national championship.|$|E
25|$|But, {{whatever}} {{might be}} Shaftesbury's speculative opinions or his mode of expressing them, all witnesses bear {{testimony to the}} elevation and purity {{of his life and}} aims. As an earnest student, and ardent lover of liberty, an enthusiast in the cause of virtue, and a man of <b>unblemished</b> life and untiring beneficence, Shaftesbury probably had no superior in his generation. His character and pursuits are the more remarkable, considering the rank of life in which he was born and the circumstances under which he was brought up. In many respects he reminds us of the Stoic philosopher and Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, whose works he studied with avidity, and whose influence is stamped upon his own productions.|$|E
25|$|Nagako was betrothed to her {{distant cousin}} Prince Hirohito (1901–1989) {{at a very}} young age, in a match {{arranged}} by their parents, which was usual in Japanese society at that time. Her lineage and her father's <b>unblemished</b> military career were the major considerations. In January 1919, the engagement of Princess Nagako to the then-Crown Prince Hirohito (later Emperor Shōwa), was announced. In a step away from tradition, Hirohito was allowed to choose his own bride. Nagako herself had no choice in the matter. At the age of 14, she and other eligible women participated in a tea ceremony at the Imperial Palace while the Crown Prince watched unseen from behind a screen. He eventually selected Nagako.|$|E
25|$|Alabama won the {{overtime}} coin toss, {{choosing to}} play on defense first. On their first possession, Charles Scott of LSU ran for a 5-yard gain. Richard Murphy rushed for a loss of one on the following play, as Alabama linebacker Rolando McClain stopped him short {{of the line of}} scrimmage. On third down, Jarrett Lee threw his fourth interception of the game when Rashad Johnson again intercepted a pass. The interception ended LSU's first overtime possession, giving the ball to Alabama. The Tide offense came out throwing, as John Parker Wilson completed a 23-yard strike to Julio Jones, moving the ball to the two-yard line of LSU. After a short rush by Glen Coffee, Wilson jumped over a pile of players to get his second rushing touchdown, and preserve Alabama's <b>unblemished</b> record. With the win, the Crimson Tide clinched the SEC West Division, and a spot in the 2008 SEC Championship Game, and improved Alabama's all-time record against the Tigers to 44–23–5.|$|E
25|$|As {{the meal}} {{resulting}} from a slaughter offering was seen as holy, the guests were required to change their garments if possible; impurity would have excluded them from participation. Sometimes festive garments, which were seen as having sanctity, were borrowed for this purpose from the priests, and rings, having the significance of amulets, were worn in honour of the deity. Like the other types of sacrifice, the act began with the imposition of the offerer's hands onto the sacrificial animal, which would then be killed, and its blood collected and sprinkled upon the altar; however, slaughter offerings could be killed anywhere within the Temple Courtyard, {{not only on the}} north side of the altar. Oxen, sheep, and goats, are explicitly identified by the Biblical text as being used for slaughter offerings, but unlike other types of sacrifice, there was no rigid insistence that the animal be <b>unblemished,</b> or on the gender of the animal.|$|E
25|$|With little {{talent and}} less acquirements, he was, {{throughout}} his life, {{one of the}} most considerable men in the country and a striking instance of that most agreeable truth—that courage and honesty in great situations more than supply the place of policy or talent. It was not his relationship to Lord Rockingham, though no doubt an advantage, nor his princely fortune, though a yet greater, which conferred the sort of importance he enjoyed for half a century in this country. He derived it more directly and more certainly from his goodness and generosity, and from the combination of gentleness and courage which distinguished his amiable and unpretending character. Such <b>unblemished</b> purity and such unobtrusive intrepidity, such generosity of feeling, firmness of purpose, and tenderness of heart, meeting in one of high station and princely fortune, commanded the affection and confidence of the public; and Lord Fitzwilliam enjoyed them, beyond even those of his own class who united much greater reach of understanding and more assiduity of business to superior personal accomplishments and advantages.|$|E
25|$|A {{medical school}} graduate, a piano enthusiast, a former sportswriter, a {{one-time}} automobile dealership owner, and a veteran {{football and basketball}} coach, Doc Stewart quickly became a popular figure across diverse segments of the University population. His oratory eloquence landed him an open job offer {{from the head of}} the UT English Department. After having coached the football team to an undefeated season, Stewart turned to implementing an entirely new style of basketball at Texas—one that emphasized ball movement and man-to-man defense and that essentially dispensed with the dribble altogether. Texas entered the season expected to finish third or fourth in conference play behind TCU, Oklahoma A, and possibly Texas A Texas opened the season with a one-point win and two four-point wins over Southwestern—an opponent that had lost its previous six games against the Longhorns by an average of almost 20 points—leading to concern in the local newspapers. Contrary to prognostications, Texas opened the conference slate with two wins over Oklahoma A and sweeps of six other conference series to reach 14–0 in conference play, securing at least a share of the SWC championship with six games remaining, all away from Austin. The Longhorns next traveled more than 500 miles by train to open a long and bitter basketball rivalry with the Arkansas Razorbacks, then in their first year of competition in the sport, earning four- and 11-point wins in Fayetteville. Despite its <b>unblemished</b> record, Texas was still predicted to lose at least one game to the Aggies in College Station. The Longhorns instead managed 24–14 and 17–11 victories over the Aggies to finish as the last undefeated team in Texas and SWC history at 23–0. Senior guard Abb Curtis would later receive retroactive recognition for the 1924 season as UT's second-ever consensus first-team All-American in basketball.|$|E

500|$|At the time, the National Hockey League was {{considered}} to be where the best hockey players played, and its best players consisted largely of Canadians. The public consensus of hockey pundits and fans in North America was that other countries, the Soviets in this case, were simply no match for Canada's best. The Soviets were not expected to even give the Canadians a challenge, and Canada was going into this series expected to win handily. According to Team Canada Coach Harry Sinden: [...] "Canada is first in the world in two things: hockey and wheat." [...] Alan Eagleson said [...] "We gotta win in eight games. Anything less than an <b>unblemished</b> sweep of the Russians would bring shame down on the heads of the players and the national pride." [...] The Soviets downplayed themselves, stating that they were in the series to learn.|$|E
500|$|In 1922, {{after some}} risqué films {{and a series}} of {{off-screen}} scandals involving Hollywood stars, the studios enlisted Presbyterian elder William H.

Hays, later nicknamed the motion picture [...] "Czar", was paid the then-lavish sum of $100,000 a year (equivalent to more than $1.4 million in 2014 dollars). Hays, Postmaster General under Warren G.

500|$|The Maya Sita motif is {{considered}} as the [...] "most important instance of an addition" [...] in the Ramayana. The Kurma Purana ( [...] 550–850 CE) {{is the first}} text where Maya Sita appears. The key event of the Ramayana story – the kidnapping of Sita by Ravana – was replaced with the abduction of Maya Sita (an unreal Sita) by Ravana; meanwhile Sita is protected in the refuge of Agni, the fire god. This [...] "important ideological development" [...] in Vaishnavism (Vishnu-centric sect) protected Sita's chastity. Some versions of the Ramayana {{such as the ones}} in the Mahabharata (5th to 4th century BCE), the Vishnu Purana (1st century BCE–4th century CE), the Harivamsa (1–300 CE) and several Puranas (the suffix Purana denotes that the text is part of this genre) omit the Agni Pariksha altogether to avoid questioning Sita's purity. In contrast, this very Agni Pariksha became a device for the return of the <b>unblemished</b> Sita, as Sita and Maya Sita switch places again, in some later versions.|$|E
500|$|Drake's {{physical}} attractiveness {{has been}} {{another area of}} commentary, {{with at least one}} reviewer declaring a man crush for him. Drake has been described as [...] "dreamy", and a [...] "handsome, charismatic hero." [...] Claudia Black, voice of Chloe Frazer from , admitted having a crush on Drake as well. Drake has been cited {{as an example of a}} male character who, while attractive, is not over-masculine. One commentator pointed out: [...] "Very few of our protagonists (Nathan Drake and Alan Wake to name a few exceptions) depict men in what I would call a non-degrading manner." [...] Steve McGarvey of GameSpy wrote that Drake was: [...] "hardly oozing with machismo compared to the likes of most gaming protagonists". Drake's attractiveness drew criticism from Meagan Marie of Game Informer, who stated that he did not: [...] "stand out much among the crowd of other ideally proportioned and intentionally <b>unblemished</b> gaming icons." [...] GameDaily named Drake the third greatest gaming hunk. GamesRadar named Drake [...] "Mister 2007", stating that he was not picked just because they could [...] "stare at his ass for hours on end", but because he is heroic and has a [...] "winning attitude". In 2014, La Nueva España included him the top ten sexiest video game characters of both genders.|$|E
500|$|Evancho's second {{full-length}} feature album (her {{first on}} a major label), Dream with Me, produced by David Foster for Sony and Syco Music, was released on June 14, 2011. The album debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart, reached No. 1 on Billboards Classical Albums Chart, and was certified gold by the RIAA. The album also performed well internationally, with Evancho becoming the youngest artist ever to debut in the UK in the top 5. The album's 14 tracks range from popular songs ("Angel") to classical arias ("Ombra mai fu"), and original songs, including the title track, for which Evancho contributed to the lyrics.
