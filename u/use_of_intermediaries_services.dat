40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{focuses on}} the demand for tour operators' and travel agencies' products in the United Kingdom with the main aim of analysing current market trends and suggesting possible future development. The theoretical part provides a background for the analysis through basic definitions of tourism, characteristics and development of tour operators and travel agencies in the United Kingdom and describes current situation in the country affecting behaviour of consumers. The practical part discusses the current market position of tour operators and travel agencies in the United Kingdom and mentions innovations of these subjects. This part is followed by author's own survey spread among residents of the United Kingdom which identify their preferences about travelling and <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>intermediary</b> <b>services...</b>|$|R
40|$|The new {{possibilities}} offered by information & communication technologies (ICTs) within the work-place and elsewhere have attracted wide attention by {{economic and social}} actors. One outcome is the institutional ‘push’ for all businesses to embrace these technologies and ‘get online’. However, {{it is evident that}} take-up amongst businesses has been highly uneven with some cautious in their adoption and, thus, many have not fully exploited the possibilities offered. To understand this variety in the adoption and <b>use</b> <b>of</b> online technologies (which in some cases includes their nonadoption and non-use) it is necessary to examine practices and establish underlying dynamics surrounding new forms of ICTs. This thesis will investigate the practices associated with the adoption and <b>use</b> <b>of</b> ICTs in the hotel industry. Three basic questions are addressed. The first relates the online practices of hoteliers, including the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> online <b>intermediary</b> <b>services,</b> the nature <b>of</b> uptake and the implications for both practices and relations with customers. The second relates to any externalities which condition a hotelier’s practices. The third is concerned with how to conceptual explain observations – findings. Investigation of these questions has resulted in an empirically rich study. This has involved a multi-method approach that allows online practices to be viewed through different lenses and from an adapted Social Shaping of Technology perspective. The population of Scottish serviced accommodation providers was compiled and used to determine the uptake of online practice. Interviews revealed specific practices. Published material provided insight into contextual issues, particularly those relating to institutional developments. The research shows that there were three principle strategies for the adoption of the new technologies. First, they were embedded by the users themselves (‘internalisation’) – often through much effort and processes of configuration – into their ‘busy day’. The process of ‘learning’ (or learning by trying) was found to be an integral feature of uptake. Secondly, some users opted for an alternative solution where, rather than design their own website, they adopted the offerings <b>of</b> online <b>intermediaries</b> (such as online booking facilities) (‘intermediation’). However, the appropriation of online intermediation was found to be both costly and fraught with new kinds of risks (e. g. double bookings) and uncertainty (e. g. no guarantees of bookings). Thirdly, a further option (‘localisation’) was for local groups of hoteliers to collectively produce an online presence that promotes the locality and thereby indirectly provides benefits to their businesses. The analysis was performed using a modified version of Silverstone’s (1992) ‘domestication’ framework. However, ‘localisation’ questioned the assumptions underpinning ‘domestication’, suggesting the need for a more sophisticated analytical device, such as offered by the metaphor of ‘tailoring’. It is concluded that the apparently deterministic institutional view of the benefit of online technologies and the imperative that they are fully exploited to give competitive advantage, can be at odds with the locally contingent and diverse nature of online practices. The research found that the new online practices did not entirely replace traditional ones, but emerged as complementary to them...|$|R

40|$|The e-marketplaces, which play an {{important}} role in facilitating transactions and aggregating information in electronic commerce, show positive inter-group externalities where one group’s benefit from receiving a service depends on the number <b>of</b> the <b>intermediary</b> <b>services</b> consumed by the other group, and negative intra-group externalities where the surplus is destroyed because members within the group compete with each other. In this paper, with a different approach from the emerging two-sided markets theory and the traditional microeconomic theory, we analyze a monopolistic e-marketplace owned by a third-party firm by substituting the size of consumers with the number <b>of</b> <b>intermediary</b> <b>services.</b> Moreover, we pay close attention to solving the following problems: 1) When these inter- and intra-group externalities exist, are both the demand curves and the pricing strategies <b>of</b> <b>intermediary</b> <b>services</b> different from those of traditional goods? 2) How to price <b>intermediary</b> <b>services</b> to maximize profit in the e-marketplaces? 3) How do these network externalities affect the management strategy of platforms?

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the legislation, doctrinal {{opinions}} and relevant case law regarding the liability <b>of</b> <b>intermediary</b> <b>service</b> providers in Romania and to contribute to the current stage of knowledge in this matter. The objectives pursued by the author are: identification of the peculiarities of the transposition of the E-Commerce Directive into Romanian legislation; identification of problems that could arise from law’s interpretation; issuing of the de lege ferenda proposals. According to Romanian Law, the rule is the liability <b>of</b> the <b>intermediary</b> <b>service</b> provider. The liability limitations apply to certain clearly delimited activities carried out by service providers, precisely defined by art. 12 - 15 from Law no. 362 / 2002, as: mere conduit, caching, hosting, search engines and hyperlinks. Romanian Law does not offer the possibility to impose on service provider an obligation to monitor the information they transmit or store or an obligation to actively seek out facts and circumstances, even if it could be only for specific, clearly defined individual case. The notice and take down procedures for illegal content is not a legal obligation according to Romanian Law. The Romanian Law is mandatory only for service providers established in Romania...|$|R

40|$|The {{majority}} of SME’s tends to outsource administrative tasks, including their direct {{relationships with the}} (electronic) government.

This research paper explores the origin, added value and future position <b>of</b> these <b>intermediary</b> organisations with respect to the delivery of e-government services to businesses. Results indicate that (re-) intermediation is more likely to occur within this context than disintermediation is.

40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{reports on}} the {{procurement}} <b>of</b> <b>intermediary</b> <b>services</b> in interpreters to approximately one third of all public clients in The Netherlands. The procurement has lead to a smooth transition from public to a private organization and the new intermediary performs {{to the satisfaction of}} its clients. The problem is however that the procurement has lead to a situation with a dominant intermediary. We discuss the implications in two situations that are very likely to take place in the near future: a situation in which a new lot will procured on the monopolized market, and {{a situation in which the}} current contract will be replaced. One of the recommendations is to use the most-favored-costumer clause of the old contract to attract new entrants...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- As a {{long-term}} incentive plan, {{the theory of}} Executive Stock Options is theoretically perfect. However, there are some obvious implementation obstacles on its stimulating impact in some field, such as legislation, market, supervision, assessment, tax preference and so on. Therefore, this paper analyzes the barriers of Executive Stock Options and its countermeasures by using comparative analysis method, empirical analysis method and case analyzing method aiming at enhancing the incentive effect on the implementation of Executive Stock Options in Chinese listed corporations. Finally, it is concluded that such countermeasures should be taken as follows: Establishing and improving laws and regulations about the stock options, setting up scientific evaluation system, reinforcing the supervision dynamics <b>of</b> <b>intermediary</b> <b>service</b> institutions, industriously enhancing the effectiveness of security markets of China and providing the support on tax policy etc...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{science is}} {{increasingly}} data-intensive, multidisciplinary, and network-centric. There is an emerging consensus {{among the members}} of the academic research community that the practices of this new science paradigm should be congruent with "open science". This entails that the bonanza of research data, the wide availability of algorithms, data tools, and data services produced by the members of the research community must be discoverable, understandable, and usable by overcoming all kinds of heterogeneity and logical inconsistencies. The main concept for coping with the many dimensions of heterogeneity and logical inconsistency is mediation. Mediation is achieved by mediators or brokers. These are software modules that exploit encoded knowledge about certain datasets, data services, and user needs in order to implement an <b>intermediary</b> <b>service.</b> A mediating environment is an environment that provides a core set <b>of</b> <b>intermediary</b> <b>services.</b> Mediation should be a distinct functionality of future research data infrastructures. This paper surveys the different levels of interoperability, i. e., exchangeability, compatibility, and usability, their properties and relationships, mediation concepts, functions, and <b>intermediary</b> <b>services.</b> The current interoperability landscape is also illustrated. Finally, the paper advocates the need for mediating environments to be supported by future research data infrastructures and envisions {{that one of the most}} important features of future research data infrastructures will be mediation software...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} client-based dynamic server {{switching}} method that improves {{the availability and}} performance of network mediated applications. Narwhal provides a local (client-resident) intermediary broker, that can intelligently route the traffic among intermediaries. Its benefits include (1) improved availability <b>of</b> <b>intermediary</b> <b>services,</b> (2) load sharing requests across several intermediaries, (3) bypass intermediaries whenever possible, and (4) remote administrative control enabling the implementation of domain-specific policies to utilize the shared, limited networking resources. Fo example, interactive data, such as e-commerce traffic can be given higher priority than other non-critical data at the client side. Remote administrative control prevents the "tragedy of the commons " syndrome, where each client tries to locally maximize its private utilization. A shared Narwhal server performs pro-active monitoring and implements a "resource broker". A prototype was implemented for sharing intermediaries that provide SOCKS V 4 /V 5 and HTTP proxy interfaces. Experimental results show that Narwhal provide...|$|R
