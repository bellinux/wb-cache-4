5|$|On March 26, 1895, Scottish chemist Sir William Ramsay {{isolated}} helium on Earth {{by treating}} the mineral cleveite (a variety of <b>uraninite</b> {{with at least}} 10% rare earth elements) with mineral acids.

His letter of congratulations to Ramsay offers an interesting case of discovery and near-discovery in science.|$|E
5|$|Uranium is more {{plentiful}} than antimony, tin, cadmium, mercury, or silver, and it {{is about}} as abundant as arsenic or molybdenum. Uranium is found in hundreds of minerals, including <b>uraninite</b> (the most common uranium ore), carnotite, autunite, uranophane, torbernite, and coffinite.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of uranium leaching determines the economic viability of treating low grade uranium deposits, and is quite sensitive to ore characteristics. The interrelationship between mineralogy, mineral liberation and the leaching behaviour of uranium {{is not well}} defined. <b>Uraninite's</b> leaching kinetics are well studied, but relatively little leaching {{research has been conducted}} for other uranium minerals. Dissolutions higher than 90 % are very difficult to achieve under the normal operating conditions employed for acid leaching of South African ores. In this paper, a mineralogy-leachability explanation is presented to rationalise the difficulty in exceeding 90 % dissolution from low grade uranium ores in the Vaal River region (averaging 0. 3 kg U 3 O 8 /t). Based on the findings, further discussed in the paper, it appears that brannerite's intrinsic inertness is responsible for not obtaining optimum recoveries. It is also shown that for low grade uranium ores in the Witwatersrand context, the real value of uranium leaching could lie in the unlocking of extra gold (0. 4 - 0. 6 g/t) by the uranium leaching process that typically precedes cyanide leaching of gold. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{results of}} an Sm-Nd and Rb-Sr isotope study on the large and rich unconformity-type uranium-(gold-platinum-group elements) {{deposits}} in northern Australia indicate identical Sm-Nd ages for primary uranium mineralization at Nabarlek (1, 616 + _ 50 m. y.) and Jabiluka II (1, 614 _ 132 m. y.), in excellent agreement with new and previously published Rb-Sr data on U ores and altered host rocks. In contrast, the Sm-Nd ages are older than published U-Pb ages which range from 900 to 1, 437 m. y. Sm-Nd data on <b>uraninites</b> from Koongarra re strongly scattered, but the geologic setting and Nd model ages for the least disturbed samples uggest an age between 1, 600 to 1, 650 m. y., identical {{to the age of}} primary mineralization at Nabarlek and Jabiluka II. The narrow range of Sm-Nd ages for these three deposits (1, 600 - 1, 650 m. y.) indicates that mineralization took place soon after the deposition of unconformably overlying sandstones and volcanics of the 1, 650 -m. y. -old Kombolgie Formation.

5|$|Protactinium {{occurs in}} <b>uraninite</b> (pitchblende) at {{concentrations}} of about 0.3-3 parts 231Pa per million parts (ppm) of ore. Whereas the usual content {{is closer to}} 0.3 ppm (e.g. in Jáchymov, Czech Republic), some ores from the Democratic Republic of the Congo have about 3 ppm. Protactinium is homogeneously dispersed in most natural materials and in water, but at much lower concentrations {{on the order of}} one part per trillion, that corresponds to the radioactivity of 0.1 picocuries (pCi)/g. There is about 500 times more protactinium in sandy soil particles than in water, even the water present in the same sample of soil. Much higher ratios of 2,000 and above are measured in loam soils and clays, such as bentonite.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium (formerly protoactinium) is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Pa and atomic number 91. It is a dense, silvery-gray metal which readily reacts with oxygen, water vapor and inorganic acids. It forms various chemical compounds where protactinium is usually {{present in the}} oxidation state +5, but can also assume +4 and even +3 or +2 states. The average concentrations of protactinium in the Earth's crust is typically {{on the order of}} a few parts per trillion, but may reach up to a few parts per million in some <b>uraninite</b> ore deposits. Because of its scarcity, high radioactivity and high toxicity, there are currently no uses for protactinium outside of scientific research, and for this purpose, protactinium is mostly extracted from spent nuclear fuel.|$|E
25|$|Uranium {{minerals}} were {{noticed by}} miners {{for a long}} time prior to the discovery of uranium in 1789. The uranium mineral pitchblende, also known as <b>uraninite,</b> was reported from the Krušné hory (Ore Mountains), Saxony, as early as 1565. Other early reports of pitchblende date from 1727 in Jáchymov and 1763 in Schwarzwald.|$|E
5000|$|The {{geological}} formations of {{the continental}} lower Carboniferous sandstones have the uranium ore in association with quartz and feldspar which also have intrusions of clay and organic matter; Pitchblende {{is also part of}} this formation. Concentration of Uranium is of the order of 4000 ppm. Specifically, the COMINAK mines are part of the geological formations of Guezouman conglomeratic (conjectured as of Viséan age, a stage in the stratigraphic column) and in the Tarat sandstones of Namurain age, a stage in the regional stratigraphy. The Imourean deposits have been identified in the Tchirezrine sandstone of Jurassic age, a geologic period and system. In simple terms, uranium ores are found in sandstone deposits.An oxidative dissolution using sulphuric acid is the process that is used for extraction of uranium. Inference from the laboratory investigations of many samples of the tailings of the processed ore indicate that the main source of UVI could be from the ore-inherited <b>uraninites</b> influenced by oxidation and solubilization. Uranium ore is mined at Akouta, Akola and Afasto nearby. It is the largest underground uranium mine in the world. The uranium content is 0.4%. The ore is processed to produce magnesium uranate (the [...] "Yellow Cake", which contains about 75% uranium). The yield from their mines is reported as 4 kg of Uranium for every metric ton of ore extracted.|$|R
40|$|Mantle-derived potassic {{igneous rocks}} and carbonatites first {{appear in the}} {{geological}} record in the late Archean, coinciding with major crust-forming events on most continents. The compositions of potassic rocks require sources including discrete ultramafic rocks with phlogopite and pyroxenes, whereas carbonatites and ultramafic lamprophyres (carbonate-rich potassic rocks) require oxidizing conditions in which carbonate is stable. The presence of these source rocks from this time is probably related to the stabilization of mantle lithosphere. If mantle lithosphere had not been stable for considerable periods of time, then melting would be restricted to peridotite, {{which is not a}} viable option for strongly potassic rocks. The phlogopite-rich source-rock assemblages that are necessary precursors for potassic melts could be introduced into the lithosphere by either subduction processes or by multiple stages of low-degree melting. Many modern examples involve subducted sedimentary material, which concentrates potassium by the stabilization of micas in subduction metamorphism. Subduction involves a great variety of redox states, but the bulk effect is the return of oxidized material from the surface into the mantle. However, we cannot apply uniformitarianism unthinkingly, because subduction processes at and before 2. 7 Ga may have had different redox states. Before the Great Oxidation Event the distribution and abundances of geological formations such as banded iron formations, red beds, and <b>uraninites</b> indicate that geological reservoirs became gradually oxidized, preventing an earlier increase in atmospheric oxygen. This means that the function of the subduction process to oxidize the upper mantle by the return of oxidized rocks from the surface was much weaker in the early Earth. Early continental mantle lithosphere was, therefore, likely to accumulate carbon in reduced form, which would be more easily remobilized in melts through low-temperature redox melting much later in Earth history. Carbonate-rich alkaline rocks occur commonly during the rejuvenation of cratonic mantle, where carbonate melts tap carbon and mica-rich assemblages that may have slumbered in mantle lithosphere for extended periods of time. 1 page(s...|$|R
25|$|Radium, in {{the form}} of radium chloride, was {{discovered}} by Marie and Pierre Curie in 1898. They extracted the radium compound from <b>uraninite</b> and published the discovery at the French Academy of Sciences five days later. Radium was isolated in its metallic state by Marie Curie and André-Louis Debierne through the electrolysis of radium chloride in 1911.|$|E
25|$|Radioactivity {{is a rare}} property; {{minerals}} may {{be composed}} of radioactive elements. They could be a defining constituent, such as uranium in <b>uraninite,</b> autunite, and carnotite, or as trace impurities. In the latter case, the decay of a radioactive element damages the mineral crystal; the result, termed a radioactive halo or pleochroic halo, is observable by various techniques, such as thin-section petrography.|$|E
25|$|Uranium dioxide or uranium(IV) oxide (2), {{also known}} as urania or uranous oxide, is an oxide of uranium, and is a black, radioactive, {{crystalline}} powder that naturally occurs in the mineral <b>uraninite.</b> It is used in nuclear fuel rods in nuclear reactors. A mixture of uranium and plutonium dioxides is used as MOX fuel. Prior to 1960, it was used as yellow and black color in ceramic glazes and glass.|$|E
25|$|It is {{considered}} to be more plentiful than antimony, beryllium, cadmium, gold, mercury, silver, or tungsten and is about as abundant as tin, arsenic or molybdenum. It is found in many minerals including <b>uraninite</b> (most common uranium ore), autunite, uranophane, torbernite, and coffinite. Significant concentrations of uranium occur in some substances such as phosphate rock deposits, and minerals such as lignite, and monazite sands in uranium-rich ores (it is recovered commercially from these sources).|$|E
25|$|In nature, radium {{is found}} in uranium and (to a lesser extent) thorium ores in trace amounts {{as small as a}} seventh of a gram per ton of <b>uraninite.</b> Radium is not {{necessary}} for living organisms, and adverse health effects are likely when it is incorporated into biochemical processes because of its radioactivity and chemical reactivity. Currently, other than its use in nuclear medicine, radium has no commercial applications; formerly, it was used as a radioactive source for radioluminescent devices and also in radioactive quackery for its supposed curative powers. Today, these former applications are no longer in vogue because radium's toxicity has since become known, and less dangerous isotopes are used instead in radioluminescent devices.|$|E
25|$|All {{isotopes}} of radium have half-lives {{much shorter}} than {{the age of the}} Earth, so that any primordial radium would have decayed long ago. Radium nevertheless still occurs in the environment, as the isotopes 223Ra, 224Ra, 226Ra, and 228Ra are part of the decay chains of natural thorium and uranium isotopes; since thorium and uranium have very long half-lives, these daughters are continually being regenerated by their decay. Of these four isotopes, the longest-lived is 226Ra (half-life 1600years), a decay product of natural uranium. Because of its relative longevity, 226Ra is the most common isotope of the element, making up about one part per trillion of the Earth's crust; essentially all natural radium is 226Ra. Thus, radium is found in tiny quantities in the uranium ore <b>uraninite</b> and various other uranium minerals, and in even tinier quantities in thorium minerals. One ton of pitchblende typically yields about one seventh of a gram of radium. One kilogram of the Earth's crust contains about 900picograms of radium, and one liter of sea water contains about 89femtograms of radium.|$|E
25|$|Radium was {{discovered}} by Marie Sklodowska-Curie and her husband Pierre Curie on 21 December 1898, in a <b>uraninite</b> (pitchblende) sample. While studying the mineral earlier, the Curies removed uranium from it {{and found that the}} remaining material was still radioactive. They separated out an element similar to bismuth from pitchblende in July 1898, {{that turned out to be}} polonium. They then separated out a radioactive mixture consisting mostly of two components: compounds of barium, which gave a brilliant green flame color, and unknown radioactive compounds which gave carmine spectral lines that had never been documented before. The Curies found the radioactive compounds to be very similar to the barium compounds, except that they were more insoluble. This made it possible for the Curies to separate out the radioactive compounds and discover a new element in them. The Curies announced their discovery to the French Academy of Sciences on 26 December 1898. The naming of radium dates to about 1899, from the French word radium, formed in Modern Latin from radius (ray): this was in recognition of radium's power of emitting energy in the form of rays.|$|E
500|$|Thorium and uranium are {{the most}} {{abundant}} actinides in nature with the respective mass concentrations of 16ppm and 4ppm. Uranium mostly occurs in the Earth's crust as a mixture of its oxides in the minerals <b>uraninite,</b> which is also called pitchblende because of its black color. There are several dozens of other [...] such as carnotite (KUO2VO4·3H2O) and autunite (Ca(UO2)2(PO4)2·nH2O). The isotopic composition of natural uranium is 238U (relative abundance 99.2742%), 235U (0.7204%) and 234U (0.0054%); of these 238U has the largest half-life of 4.51 years. The worldwide production of uranium in 2009 amounted to 50,572 tonnes, of which 27.3% was mined in Kazakhstan. Other important uranium mining countries are Canada (20.1%), Australia (15.7%), Namibia (9.1%), Russia (7.0%), and Niger (6.4%).|$|E
500|$|Uranium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol U and atomic number92. It is a silvery-white metal in the actinide {{series of the}} periodic table. A uranium atom has 92 protons and 92 electrons, of which 6 are valence electrons. Uranium is weakly radioactive because all isotopes of uranium are unstable, with half-lives varying between 159,200 years and 4.5 billion years. The most common isotopes in natural uranium are uranium-238 (which has 146 neutrons and accounts for over 99%) and uranium-235 (which has 143 neutrons). Uranium has the highest atomic weight of the primordially occurring elements. Its density is about 70% {{higher than that of}} lead, and slightly lower than that of gold or tungsten. It occurs naturally in low concentrations of a few parts per million in soil, rock and water, and is commercially extracted from uranium-bearing minerals such as <b>uraninite.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{action of}} {{micro-organisms}} can fix uranium; Thermoanaerobacter can use chromium(VI), iron(III), cobalt(III), manganese(IV) and uranium(VI) as electron acceptors while acetate, glucose, hydrogen, lactate, pyruvate, succinate, and xylose {{can act as}} electron donors for the metabolism of the bacteria. In this way the metals {{can be reduced to}} form magnetite (Fe3O4), siderite (FeCO3), rhodochrosite (MnCO3), and <b>uraninite</b> (UO2). Other researchers have also worked on the fixing of uranium using bacteria , Francis R. Livens et al. (Working at Manchester) have suggested that the reason why Geobacter sulfurreducens can reduce [...] cations to uranium dioxide is that the bacteria reduce the uranyl cations to [...] which then undergoes disproportionation to form [...] and UO2. This reasoning was based (at least in part) on the observation that [...] is not converted to an insoluble neptunium oxide by the bacteria.|$|E
2500|$|Ridgefield {{consists}} of hilly, rocky terrain, ranging from [...] {{above sea level}} (at Pine Mountain) to [...] at Branchville. Its average village elevation is [...] above sea level. The landscape is strewn with countless rocks deposited by glaciers, and among the town's bodies of water is Round Pond, formed in a kettle left by the last glacier 20,000 years ago. A particularly interesting feature is Cameron's Line, named for Eugene N. Cameron, who discovered that rocks west of the line differed greatly from those east of it. This fault line was formed some 250 million {{years ago by the}} collision of [...] "Proto North America" [...] and [...] "Proto Africa", and there are still occasional light earthquakes felt along its length. The line bisects the southern half of the town, running generally north of West Lane, across {{the north end of the}} village, past the south end of Great Swamp and generally easterly into Redding in the Topstone area. North of Cameron's Line, the town is rich in limestone. The mineral was extensively mined, and remnants of several limekilns exist today. Also mined here in the 19th century was mica, pegmatite, and quartz. Gold, as well as gemstones such as garnet and beryl, have been found here, and dozens of minerals have been unearthed at the old Branchville Mica Quarry. <b>Uraninite,</b> a source of uranium, is found here, too.|$|E
