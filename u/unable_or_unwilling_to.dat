Davis reveals Maurice Levy has a mole in the courthouse from whom he illegally purchases copies of sealed indictments. Herc tells Levy that the Stanfield case was probably based on an illegal wiretap, something which would jeopardize the entire case. After Levy reveals this to Pearlman, she uses Levy's espionage to blackmail him into agreeing to a plea bargain for his defendants.

5|$|In {{accordance}} with the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw. 7, c.9) which brought the Territorial Force into being, the TF {{was intended to be}} a home defence force for service during wartime and members could not be compelled to serve outside the country. However, on the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, many members volunteered for Imperial Service. Therefore, TF units were split in August and September 1914 into 1st Line (liable for overseas service) and 2nd Line (home service for those <b>unable</b> <b>or</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> serve overseas) units. Later, a 3rd Line was formed to act as a reserve, providing trained replacements for the 1st and 2nd Line regiments.|$|E
5|$|In {{diplomatic}} {{talks with}} the Ho-Chunks {{at the close of}} the war, General Atkinson promised that the U.S. government would look into their grievances in the lead mining region. Thomas McKenney requested military aid to evict American miners who were trespassing on Ho-Chunk land, but after the war, settlers poured into the region in unprecedented numbers, and U.S. officials proved to be <b>unable</b> <b>or</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> stem the tide. By January 1828, there were as many as 10,000 illegal settlers on Ho-Chunk land, including militia general Henry Dodge, who established a mining camp after the war and boasted that the U.S. Army could not make him leave. Having no other options, on August 25, 1828, the Ho-Chunks signed a provisional treaty with the United States, agreeing to sell the land occupied by the miners in a more formal treaty to be held later.|$|E

At times his city of birth is cited as Chicago, year of birth 1901 - again, Hensche made no effort to discourage that date or place of birth, perhaps due to anti-German sentiment during the World Wars).

5|$|In 1054 King Edward sent Ealdred to Germany {{to obtain}} Emperor Henry III's help in {{returning}} Edward the Exile, son of Edmund Ironside, to England. Edmund (reigned 1016) was an elder half-brother of King Edward the Confessor, and Edmund's son Edward was in Hungary with King Andrew I, having left England {{as an infant}} after his father's death and the accession of Cnut as King of England. In this mission Ealdred was somewhat successful and obtained insight into the working of the German church during a stay of a year with Hermann II, the Archbishop of Cologne. He also {{was impressed with the}} buildings he saw, and later incorporated some of the German styles into his own constructions. The main objective of the mission, however, was to secure the return of Edward; but this failed, mainly because Henry III's relations with the Hungarians were strained, and the emperor was <b>unable</b> <b>or</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> help Ealdred. Ealdred was able to discover that Edward was alive, and had a place at the Hungarian court. Although some sources state that Ealdred attended the coronation of Emperor Henry IV, this is not possible, as on the date that Henry was crowned, Ealdred was in England consecrating an abbot.|$|E

Agricola's successors were seemingly <b>unable</b> <b>or</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> further subdue the far north. Despite his apparent successes, Agricola himself {{fell out of}} favour {{and it is possible}} that Domitian may have been informed of the fraudulence of his claims to have won a significant victory. The fortress at Inchtuthil was dismantled before its completion and the other fortifications of the Gask Ridge (erected to consolidate the Roman presence in Scotland in the aftermath of Mons Graupius) were abandoned within the space of a few years. It is possible that the costs of a drawn-out war outweighed any economic or political benefit and it was deemed more profitable to leave the Caledonians to themselves. By 87 the occupation was limited to the Southern Uplands {{and by the end of}} the 1st century the northern limit of Roman expansion was a line drawn between the Tyne and Solway Firth.

Later he wires Charles for $100 to pay for the clothes he stole. After Adam finally makes his way home to their farm, Charles reveals that Cyrus had died and left them an inheritance of $50,000 each.

5000|$|Militarized hegemonic masculinity {{has also}} {{impacted}} perceptions of citizenship {{as well as}} the LGBT community. Conscription is fairly common throughout the world, and has also been utilized in America during key conflicts. The majority of men expect conscription to be the price of adult citizenship, but religious objectors and homosexuals have been largely excluded from this. These restrictions have led to the perceived subordinate status of these groups, and their subsequent exclusion from full citizenship, in the same fashion that women have been excluded. This is reflective of the notion that men <b>unable</b> <b>to,</b> <b>or</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> fight for their country are more effeminate, as they are breaking with hegemonic norms. The perceptions that homosexuals are unfit for service, and that women have a responsibility at home, is reflective of the heteronormative nature of the military. The institutional composition of the military, itself, reinforces this hegemony through the armed branch's subordination to a [...] "dominating and organizationally competent" [...] branch. Essentially, there is an armed wing, which is masculinized through conflict, and there is a dominating branch that is masculinized through power. The hierarchical nature of the military is used to enforce, replicate, and enhance hegemonic masculinity.|$|R
40|$|A diagram is {{a visual}} {{representation}} that displays {{information in a}} spatial layout. In problem solving, a diagram can serve to unpack {{the structure of a}} problem and provide the foundation for problem solution. Hence, students are often recommended to use diagrams in solving mathematical problems. For some students, this recommendation is helpful and they are able to use the diagram as a powerful tool in mathematical thinking and learning. However for other students, this suggestion is singularly unhelpful. Some students are <b>unable</b> <b>or</b> perhaps <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> use diagrams on a problem-solving task. Students’ lack of knowledge about the utility of a diagram suggests {{that they need to be}} empowered to use the diagram as an effective mathematical tool. This chapter explores the knowledge that students require to become diagram literate and identifies some of the difficulties that students experience in their use of diagrams. As we discuss here, it is essential that students know why a diagram can be useful in problem solving, which diagram is appropriate for a given situation, and how to use a diagram to solve a problem. The chapter concludes with suggestions for developing diagram literacy within the mathematics curriculum...|$|R

Executive Summary There is a large gap in higher education attainment between different groups of society, especially along gender, class and ethnic dimensions. Reducing these gaps in attainment has {{been at the forefront of}} policy makers, not only in this country but also in most advanced economy with policies ranging from financial support to positive discrimination. However, policies can only be effective if the reasons behind these gaps are understood. Several explanations have been suggested to explain these gaps. Economists have focused on market failures and particularly that in the absence of collateral, students from some background may be <b>unable</b> – <b>or</b> <b>unwilling</b> – <b>to</b> finance their education by loan. This suggests that policies of grants should reduce the attainment gap; however evidence of the efficiency of these policies has been mixed. Another reason for not investing in higher education may be a lack of information on the cost...|$|R
40|$|The models {{within the}} theory of {{contracts}} {{can be divided into}} several sub-categories taking into consideration whether they describe a bilateral or a multilateral relationship, whether they are static or dynamic, whether they involve complete or incomplete contracts and so on. For our purpose, we shall focus below on the distinction between complete and incomplete contracts. Assuming that contracts are complete is a very strong premise implying that all contingencies that may affect the contractual relationship are taken into account. Therefore while in an ideal world the parties would simply write down a binding contract specifying each agent’s obligation in each conceivable eventuality, in reality such a contract is impossible to design. As Salanie (2000) points out, there might be several reasons why contracts would in fact be incomplete. In the first place, negotiating a contract in the real world is not void of costs; very often it mobilizes managers and lawyers. It comes by default then that at some point the cost of considering an improbable contingency outweighs the benefits of specifying it in a specific clause. Secondly, third parties are often <b>unable</b> <b>or</b> even <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> verify ex-post values taken by certain variables observed by the contracting parties. In other words the contracting parties, even when abstracting from the costs of negotiating, writing and legalizing the contract, are forced by their inherent bounded rationality to neglect some variables whose effect on the relationship they find difficult to evaluate. And finally, it is sometimes very cumbersome to assign a probability to some relevant events and thus to condition on such circumstances, which is again originating in our bounded rationality...|$|R
6000|$|This is, so to speak, {{one of the}} {{standing}} questions of theology; it reappears with slight changes of form at every period of religious interest, it is for example the chief issue between the Arminian and the Calvinist. From its very opening proposition modern religion sweeps past and {{far ahead of the}} old Arminian teachings of Wesleyans and Methodists, in its insistence upon the entirely finite nature of God. Arminians seem merely to have insisted that God has conditioned himself, and by his own free act left men free to accept or reject salvation. To the realist type of mind--here as always I use [...] "realist" [...] in its proper sense as the opposite of nominalist--to the old-fashioned, over-exact and over-accentuating type of mind, such ways of thinking seem vague and unsatisfying. Just as it distresses the more downright kind of intelligence with a feeling of disloyalty to admit that God is not Almighty, so it troubles the same sort of intelligence to hear that there is no clear line to be drawn between the saved and the lost. Realists like an exclusive flavour in their faith. Moreover, it is a natural weakness of humanity to be forced into extreme positions by argument. It is probable, as I have already suggested, that the absolute attributes of God were forced upon Christianity under the stresses of propaganda, and it is probable that the theory of a super-human obstinancy beyond salvation arose out of the irritations natural to theological debate. It is but a step from the realisation that there are people absolutely <b>unable</b> <b>or</b> absolutely <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> see God as we see him, to the conviction that they are therefore shut off from God by an invincible soul blindness.|$|R
