The Norwegian state took possession of all <b>unclaimed</b> <b>land,</b> or 95.2% of the archipelago, at the time the Svalbard Treaty entered into force; Store Norske owns 4%, Arktikugol owns 0.4%, while other private owners hold 0.4%.|$|E
5|$|The new Virginia {{counties}} {{were growing}} rapidly, {{and with this}} growth came trouble. Trigg was appointed {{as one of the}} judges to the Virginia Land Court commission of 1779–80 charged with settling land disputes in Kentucky County, Virginia. The Virginia Land Act of 1779 had set up this court of four judges in order to examine the numerous land claims and to certify valid titles. The four judges arrived at St. Asaph in October and triggered emigration to Kentucky as people wished to either certify their claims or seek <b>unclaimed</b> <b>land.</b> They closed their court on February 26, 1780, and prepared to return home. However, in March they were told that they had to reopen the court and stay through April, as claimants were delayed due to weather. Trigg and two fellow judges reconvened on April 16 and heard another 134 cases. In all, the court judged 1,328 claims covering over 1 million acres (4,000km²) of land. After these sessions ended, Trigg stayed and established his home on 1,000 acres (4km²) of land at Trigg's Station about four miles (6km) north-west of Harrodsburg in Kentucky County, Virginia.|$|E

25|$|In the {{beginning}} of its colonization, many of Pennsylvania’s settlers occupied the land not through acquiring the legal rights, but by building on any <b>unclaimed</b> <b>land</b> they found, or squatting. The squatters came to the Palmyra area between 1717 and 1740. Because the squatters had no official documents stating {{when they came to}} the land, it is difficult to precisely trace family migrations to and from the area. From looking at what records do exist, and by the people still living in the Palmyra area, {{it is clear that the}} first settlers to live near Palmyra came from two distinct nationalities, the Scotch-Irish and the German Palatinates.|$|E
25|$|Before {{and after}} the nesting season, groups of {{breeding}} birds will sometimes initiate gatherings; these seem to occur at the boundary of the group's combined range or in the <b>unclaimed</b> <b>land</b> separating it from neighbouring groups. The initiation signal is a conspicuous display flight given by a bird surveying its territory: it spirals tens of meters/yards high into the air, usually briefly does a fluttering hover {{at the top of}} the spiral, and then glides down. Group neighbours will respond by performing the same type of flight, and eventually about half the group's members will depart to the meeting location where they will spend several tens of minutes – sometimes more than an hour – chattering, calling, duetting, and excitedly moving about the meeting site (which typically is some small tree or shrubbery). In winter, birds will often assemble in small groups and roost together, particularly to keep warm during the night; this is apparently not initiated with a specific assembly display however.|$|E

50|$|The Hmong fled China (where {{they were}} {{traditionally}} paddy rice farmers) to escape persecution and pacification campaigns, gradually migrating through Vietnam and Laos, into Thailand. They adopted swidden farming {{in these regions}} by necessity because lowland basins were already settled. Small groups of households would leave an established village to start another village in relatively uninhabited upland areas. In turn, other families moving from older settlements would settle an area that had been vacated, always in search of better farmlands than those {{that had been left}} behind. As the population of both Hmong and other neighboring groups increased, it ultimately became impossible to find new <b>unclaimed</b> <b>lands,</b> and the pioneering settlement pattern ended sometime between 1960 and 1975 in western Laos and northern Thailand. Villages in the old settled areas of eastern Laos—Xiangkhoang and Louangphrabang—in many cases have been in one location for more than thirty or fifty years and have grown in size to as many as sixty or eighty households and more than 500 persons.|$|R
5000|$|In {{an effort}} to promote {{ecological}} sustainability, payment for various environmental services are given to landowners in order to motivate reforestation on their land. A major issue with these programs is that most small landholders do not have titles to the land. These small landholders were given plots to cultivate when they worked on larger farms or many were displaced migrants who settled in <b>unclaimed</b> <b>lands.</b> Since they have no legal documentation of land ownership they can’t apply {{for many of the}} correct land use incentives, thus little consideration of long-term effects on the land is given. Another issue is that the programs don’t differentiate between small-scale and large-scale landowners. In {{an effort to}} reduce Carbon emissions the MBC offers incentives for carbon sinks. Large-scale landowners have taken advantage of these systems by planting African Oil Palms on their lands. These plants provide them with more carbon credits whereas a small landowner who is maintaining forest will receive little to no carbon credits ...|$|R

The hotbed of alcohol bootlegging, prostitution, and opium dens that sprang up in the Downtown area soon led people to give Minot the nickname [...] "Little Chicago."

5000|$|The United States Homestead Acts legally {{recognized}} {{the concept of}} the homestead principle and distinguished it from squatting, since the law gave homesteaders a legal way to occupy <b>unclaimed</b> <b>lands.</b> Additionally, US states that have a shortage of housing tend to tolerate squatters in property awaiting redevelopment until the developer is ready to begin work. However, at that point, the laws tend to be enforced. The Homestead Act of 1862 was signed by Abraham Lincoln on May 20, 1862, and was enacted to foster the reallocation of unsettled land in the West. The law applied to U.S. citizens and prospective citizens that had never borne arms against the U.S. government. It required a five-year commitment, during which time the land owner had to build a twelve-by-fourteen foot dwelling, develop the 160 acre plot of land allocated, and generally better the condition of the unsettled property. After five years of positively contributing to the homestead, the applicant could file a request for the deed to the property, which entailed sending paperwork to the General Land Office in Washington, D.C. and, from there, [...] "valid claims were granted patent free and clear". Moreover, there were loopholes to this law, including provisions made for those serving in the U.S. military.
