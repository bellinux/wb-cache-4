5|$|Unlike {{most other}} self-extracting revolvers (such as the Webley service revolvers or the Smith & Wesson No. 3 Revolver), the Enfield Mk I/Mk II was {{complicated}} to unload, having an Owen Jones selective extraction/ejection system {{which was supposed}} to allow the firer to eject spent cartridges, whilst retaining live rounds in the cylinder. The Enfield Mk I/Mk II had a hinged frame, and when the barrel was <b>unlatched,</b> the cylinder would move forward, operating the extraction system and allowing the spent cartridges to simply fall out. The idea was that the cylinder moved forward far enough to permit fired cases to be completely extracted (and ejected by gravity), but not far enough to permit live cartridges (i.e., those with projectiles still present, and thus longer in overall length) from being removed in the same manner.|$|E
25|$|Second: The {{clutch pedal}} is <b>unlatched</b> and the clutch engaged. The brake pedal is pushed forward {{as far as}} {{possible}} setting brakes on the rear wheel.|$|E
25|$|On July 2015, Land Rover had {{to recall}} over 65,000 cars {{to fix a}} {{software}} bug that allowed the vehicles' doors to be <b>unlatched</b> without notifying the driver.|$|E
40|$|Reliable <b>unlatching</b> {{mechanism}} utilizes preloading, {{a favorable}} geometric arrangement of mating surfaces, and redundancy to assure release. Even {{if only one}} rocking arm initially releases, the entire assembly will rotate or rock sideways to complete <b>unlatching.</b> Device could be useful in other applications requiring reliable remote disconnection of cables or pipes...|$|R
50|$|The rear {{bodywork}} {{included a}} pair of integral panniers and a rear mount for a spare wheel. The panniers were accessed by <b>unlatching</b> a panel under the pillion.|$|R

25|$|October 12, 1939 {{a static}} {{discharge}} at 9,000 meters ignited hydrogen in SP-2 Komsomol (VR60). The crew <b>unlatched</b> the gondola into a free fall, deployed the gondola parachute and then bailed out on personal parachutes; all survived. This failure {{led to a}} switch from hydrogen to helium.|$|E
25|$|On January 27, 2009, {{one of the}} coaster cars did {{not make}} it over the last hill on the Fairly Odd Coaster and stalled. No one was hurt, and once the lap bars were <b>unlatched,</b> the riders in the stalled car were let off. The other two cars on the circuit were stopped safely by the computer's {{actuation}} of the ride's air brakes. The ride's air brakes made a noise like a gunshot, which caused a small panic. The ride was running normally the next day.|$|E
6000|$|We went forward, and <b>unlatched</b> {{the kitchen}} door. The {{great-aunt}} {{was seated in}} her little, round-backed armchair, sipping her [...] "night-cap." ...|$|E
40|$|A {{system is}} {{described}} for performing a mechanical release function exhibiting low shock. This system includes two pyrotechnic detents fixed mounted in opposing axial alignment within a cylindrical housing having two mechanical bellows. Two mechanical bellow assemblies, each having one end hermetically bonded to the housing {{and the other}} to the respective actuator pin extending from either end of the housing, ensure that all outgassing and contamination from the operation of the pyrotechnic devices will be contained within the housing and bellows. The pin {{on one end of the}} assembly is fixed mounted and supported, via a bolt or ball-and-socket joint so that when the charge corresponding to that pin ignites, the entire assembly will exhibit rectilinear movement, including the opposing pin providing the <b>unlatching</b> motion. The release detent pin is supported by a linear bearing and when its corresponding pyrotechnic charge ignites the pin is retracted within the housing producing the same <b>unlatching</b> motion without movement of the entire assembly, thus providing complete mechanical, electrical and pyrotechnic redundancy for the <b>unlatching</b> pin...|$|R
6000|$|Talking earnestly, {{the trio}} {{had reached the}} Terrace, and James was <b>unlatching</b> the iron gate, when he {{interrupted}} himself {{in the midst of}} detailing his views on modern languages to say, 'No, I have nothing for you.' ...|$|R
60|$|The three turned {{immediately}} and went. A sound of whispering rose busily outside. Frances Freeland, glancing through the window, saw them <b>unlatching</b> the wicket gate. Sudden alarm seized her. She put out {{her head and}} called. Biddy came back.|$|R
6000|$|He {{watched her}} eyes in the heaving sun: [...] "Then what has kept, O reticent one, [...] Those lids <b>unlatched</b> - Anything promised I've not yet done?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Ojo <b>unlatched</b> {{the door}} and entered. It was very dark inside {{and he could see}} nothing at all. But the cat exclaimed: [...] "Why, there's no one here!" ...|$|E
60|$|Alice, {{blushing}} slightly, <b>unlatched</b> {{the garden}} gate, {{and went down}} the path. She {{had never been in}} the garden before, and she found her heart beating in a strange fashion.|$|E
50|$|The device {{consists}} of a spring-loaded metal bar which is fixed horizontally to a door that swings {{in the direction of}} an exit. When the bar is depressed, it activates a mechanism which <b>unlatches</b> the door, allowing occupants to quickly leave the building.|$|R
5000|$|On April 11, 2016, Tesla voluntarily {{recalled}} 2,700 Model X due {{to safety}} concerns. During collision testing, {{it was found}} that the third-row seats would <b>unlatch</b> and fold over to the second row. Tesla urged customers to avoid using the third-row seats until after repairs.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pardon me, Miss Harding," [...] he said; [...] "the door is bolted--let me <b>unlatch</b> it for you," [...] {{and very}} gallantly he did so, {{swinging}} the portal wide {{that she might}} pass out. [...] "I feared interruption," [...] he said, in explanation of the bolt.|$|R
60|$|So {{the yellow}} hen {{came to the}} door, which Dorothy <b>unlatched</b> for her to pass through, and the other {{chickens}} silently watched them from their corner without offering to approach nearer.|$|E
6000|$|She {{was shaking}} {{as if in}} a passion. His eyes {{expressed}} nothing; he only <b>unlatched</b> the gate in silence, grasped her arm and drew her in. Then closing it with a kick-- ...|$|E
60|$|Toto wagged {{his tail}} as if {{disappointed}} at being left behind; {{but he made}} no effort to follow them. The Wizard <b>unlatched</b> the door, which opened outward, and they all looked eagerly inside.|$|E
40|$|Override {{mechanism}} enables user {{to operate}} electromechanical latching mechanism manually if primary mechanism fails. Release/Engage Mechanism (REM) moves pin receivers to confine pins on object to be held. Clutch disengages electrically driven latch normally used.

50|$|Horizontal pull handles are widespread, {{including}} drawer pulls, handles on latchless {{doors and}} the outside of car doors. The inside controls for opening car doors from inside are usually pull handles, although their function of permitting the door to be pushed open is accomplished by an internal <b>unlatching</b> linkage.|$|R
60|$|There {{they are}} again, the pillars, the pediment, the Temple of Victory and the Erechtheum, {{set on a}} tawny rock cleft with shadows, {{directly}} you <b>unlatch</b> your shutters in the morning and, leaning out, hear the clatter, the clamour, the whip cracking in the street below. There they are.|$|R
60|$|He {{laid his}} hand on the handle, and felt the door come <b>unlatched.</b> Before he pulled it open, he listened again to the silence. He felt it all about him, complete, without a flaw.|$|E
60|$|As Professor Maxon and von Horn rushed {{from the}} {{workshop}} {{to their own}} campong, they neglected, in their haste, to lock the door between, {{and for the first}} time since the camp was completed it stood <b>unlatched</b> and ajar.|$|E
6000|$|Sue <b>unlatched</b> {{the other}} chamber door, and, as if seized with faintness, sank down outside it. Getting up again she half opened the door, and said [...] "Richard." [...] As the word {{came out of}} her mouth she visibly shuddered.|$|E
25|$|Bimetal strips {{are used}} in {{miniature}} circuit breakers to protect circuits from excess current. A coil of wire is used to heat a bimetal strip, which bends and operates a linkage that <b>unlatches</b> a spring-operated contact. This interrupts the circuit and can be reset when the bimetal strip has cooled down.|$|R
40|$|New {{mechanism}} turns door latch, latching or <b>unlatching</b> door, then retracts until latch is {{flush with}} surface of door frame. Concentric cylinders have cam grooves machined in surfaces. When rotated relative {{to each other}} cylinders impart rotation and translation to shaft of door latch. Motions may proceed separately or simultaneously...|$|R
50|$|At the Hitchhiker's Guide building, Ford saves {{himself by}} using Colin's {{antigravity}} systems {{to get to}} a ledge on the 13th floor of the building. He bypasses the rocket-proof glass by <b>unlatching</b> the window. Colin notes that the rocket-proof glass was installed after the Frogstar attack on the building (in Fit the Seventh), which Ford knows nothing about.|$|R
60|$|Out of {{the palace}} they walked, and met no one. They passed through the {{beautiful}} grounds, past fountains and beds of lovely flowers, and met no one. Then they <b>unlatched</b> a gate and entered a street of the city, and met no one.|$|E
60|$|It was now quite dark without. The {{door leading}} to Professor Maxon's campong, left <b>unlatched</b> {{earlier in the}} evening by von Horn for {{sinister}} motives of his own, was still unbarred through a fatal coincidence of forgetfulness {{on the part of the}} professor.|$|E

50|$|When a key {{is pressed}} down, it moves the release lever and <b>unlatches</b> the cam for that letter; the {{spring-loaded}} lever pressing on the pin rotates the cam until it engages the power roll. As the cam continues to turn, increasing radius rotates the cam's frame slightly (clockwise in the photo) {{to operate the}} typing linkage for that character.|$|R
50|$|Common {{first steps}} after an EFTO {{would be to}} fly at the best glide speed (VBG), retract flaps if {{airspeed}} permits, <b>unlatch</b> the door, and land straight ahead. Returning to the airport with a steep turn has a high probability of resulting in a stall or spin. Although it seems counter intuitive, the NTSB has recorded numerous fatal crashes due to this mistake.|$|R
