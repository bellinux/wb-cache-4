40|$|The Internet, {{a growing}} network of networks, is an often touted and often {{misunderstood}} technology. It {{has its own}} infrastructure complete with service providers, private networks, user communities, international links, etc. similar to telephone or telegraph industries. However, the Internet is more decentralized and less application-specific than traditional telecommunication industries. These differences extend beyond the technology of the Internet to the economics and policies. This paper explores Internet economics, a growing field which encompasses the technology, economics, and policy surrounding the Internet. It identifies different communities who have overlapping interests in this field and how their preconceived notions of how the Internet operates create contradictory views on how this technology will continue to evolve in a self-sustaining manner. Specifically, it explores the issue of <b>usage</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>pricing</b> versus flat-fee pricing as applied to the Internet. It provides anecdotal evidence to support general views communities have towards pricing issues. It identifies roadblocks to implement <b>usage</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>pricing</b> on the Internet.

40|$|Admission {{control and}} {{congestion}} control can provide traffic guarantees in ATM networks. However some users {{may not be}} able to describe their traffic accurately enough for the network to provide such guarantees. By sending a dynamic feedback signal about the current utilisation of network resources, the network could provide loss guarantees to users who respond appropriately, even without prior traffic descriptors. One possible feedback signal is a price per unit of network resource, based on the network load level : when the load is high, the price is high, and when the load is low, the price is low or zero. We outline a distributed iterative pricing algorithm, and show through simulations that it can simultaneously increase both network and economic efficiency. We also explore some arguments often raised against <b>usage</b> [...] <b>sensitive</b> <b>pricing,</b> and provide some counter [...] arguments.

40|$|This {{empirical}} paper {{explores the}} relationship between consumer brand preference or loyalty and price elasticity in purchase behavior. This behavior is conceptualized as resulting from two distinct but related decisions, namely a brand choice decision and a purchase quantity decision. We argue that loyal consumers will be <b>price</b> <b>sensitive</b> in the choice decision than nonloyal consumers. However, this direction {{is expected to be}} reversed in the quantity decision with loyal consumers expected to be <b>price</b> <b>sensitive</b> than nonloyal consumers. We model the choice and quantity decisions jointly using the limited dependent variable framework described in Krishnamurthi and Raj. The data used are diary panel data on a frequently purchased product class from BURKE and caffeinated ground coffee scanner data from IRI. We show that loyals are less <b>price</b> <b>sensitive</b> than nonloyals in the choice decision but more <b>price</b> <b>sensitive</b> in the quantity decision.

40|$|We {{study the}} role of pricing {{policies}} in multiple service class networks.

Borrowing heavily from the Nash implementation paradigm in economics, we then present an abstract formulation of service disciplines and pricing policies. This formulation allows us to describe more clearly the interplay between service disciplines and pricing policies in determining overall network performance. Effective multiclass service disciplines allow networks to focus resources on performance sensitive applications, while effective pricing policies allow us to spread the benefits of multiple service classes around to all users, rather than just having these benefits remain exclusively with the users of applications that are performance sensitive. Furthermore, service disciplines and pricing policies combine to form the incentive system facing a [...] ...|$|R

In this paper we propose a decentralized real-time market (RTM) model for pricing differentiated services (DiffServ), which attempts to achieve efficient resource allocation, while reducing computational overheads. We review issues relating to congestion <b>sensitive</b> <b>pricing</b> of the network resources and propose an approach to alleviate price fluctuation that considers the actual state of the network. In comparison with the existing studies that consider the existence of a single point of market equilibrium, we consider the existence of a set of equilibrium states. The proposed strategy relies on the division of link capacity into intervals called steps, where current supply is determined according to the expected resource prices, and is the sum of the allocated steps. Consequently, the real state of the market is described by immediately accessible information, such as price. 1...|$|R
40|$|This study {{constructs}} {{a profile}} of the representative Australian residential Internet user from data obtained from a web-based survey. Survey data indicate the representative user is male, 20 to 40 years of age, highly educated, uses the Internet 8 hrs per week for e-mail and FTP, and has a monthly bill of AUD 32. An ordered-logit model relates Internet use to price, sociodemographic and connection capacity variables. Model estimates show the probability of higher Internet use is greater for middle-income households, but declines with age of the user. Policy may be required to enhance access to lower-income groups, and to inform the elderly of the potential capabilities of the new technology. Further, model estimates suggest that Australian Internet subscribers prefer flat-rate pricing (or a combination of flat-rate and usage- <b>sensitive</b> <b>pricing)</b> over usage-sensitive pricing schemes. This result is consistent with Australian consumer attitudes toward local telephone and mobile cellular pricing. ...|$|R

40|$|IP flows have {{heavy-tailed}} packet and byte size distributions. This {{make them}} poor candidates for uniform sampling [...] -i. e. selecting # in # flows [...] -since omission or {{inclusion of a}} large flow can have a large effect on estimated total traffic. Flows selected in this manner are thus unsuitable for use in <b>usage</b> <b>sensitive</b> billing. We propose instead using a size-dependent sampling scheme which gives priority to the larger contributions to customer usage. This turns the heavy tails to our advantage; we can obtain accurate estimates of customer usage from {{a relatively small number}} of important samples. The sampling scheme allows us to control error when charging is <b>sensitive</b> to estimated <b>usage</b> only above a given base level. A refinement allows us to strictly limit the chance that a customers estimated usage will exceed their actual usage. Furthermore, we show that a secondary goal, that of controlling the rate at which samples are produced, can be fulfilled provided the billing cycle is sufficiently long. All these claims are supported by experiments on flow traces gathered from a commercial network. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- Improvement of Power Quality has a {{positive}} impact on sustained profitability of the distribution utility {{on the one hand and}} customer satisfaction on the other. Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) controllers have been used in power systems since the 1970 s with the objective of improving system dynamic performance. Power quality is an issue that is becoming increasingly important to electricity consumers at all levels of <b>usage.</b> <b>Sensitive</b> power electronic equipment and non-linear loads are widely used in industrial, commercial and domestic applications leading to distortion in voltage and current waveforms. Due to the environmental, right-of-way, and cost problems in both bundled and unbundled power systems, many transmission lines have been forced to operate at almost their full capacities worldwide. FACTS controllers enhance the static performance viz. increased loading, congestion management, reduced system loss, economic operation, etc., and dynamic performance viz. increased stability limits, damping of power system oscillation, etc. In this paper, an overview of FACTS controllers is explained. Various FACTS controller several devices in FACTS family are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} project {{consists of a}} system, which attempts to combine two methods of indexing documents and explores {{the idea that a}} correlation can be found between the data obtained from both methods.

The project is divided into two sub-systems: The Automatic Document Indexing System and the Manual Tagging System. This report is only concerned with the Automatic Document Indexing System. Through the implementation of the Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) algorithm, popular in the field of Machine Learning, probabilities are obtained for the terms in a small number of short articles. The tag data obtained from the Manual Tagging System is then structured into term pairs and the differences in probabilities, from the PLSA data, between these term pairs is calculated with the hope that they share a correlation with the distances between the tags in the tag clouds of the Manual Tagging System. Due to time constraints however, the algorithm’s accuracy could not be effectively evaluated...|$|R
