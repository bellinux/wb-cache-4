The typical example of a heterogeneous network is a wireless light switch: The zigbee node at the lamp may constantly receive, since it {{is connected to the}} mains supply, while a battery-powered light switch would remain asleep until the switch is thrown. The switch then wakes up, sends a command to the lamp, receives an acknowledgment, and returns to sleep. In such a network the lamp node will be at least a zigbee Router, if not the zigbee Coordinator; the switch node is typically a zigbee End Device.|$|E

A variation on the [...] "Hollywood film maker" [...] theme is that film makers wanted [...] "to avoid filming the backs" [...] of dancers.

50|$|Most bats {{have lower}} wing {{loadings}} than do birds, and he mentioned that this difference {{may be due}} to the way bats forage. Most insectivorous birds forage by making repeated, short flights. Bats, on the other hand, remain on the wing for most if not all of the time they are foraging, and insects are captured by virtue of bats' ability to maneuver rapidly. In birds, the slots formed by the alula and primary flight feathers allow these animals to have high wing loadings and fairly low stalling speeds. In the <b>unslotted</b> wings of bats, the wings do not yield such refinements in flight characteristics, but within the size and wing loadings of bats there is little need for increasing lift. In comparison, the flight of bats is much is clearly less efficient than that of birds. The upstroke consumes relatively more power in bats than in birds because the wing surfaces in bats are continuous and do not allow the passage of air as do the spaces between the primaries of a bird.|$|E

Slotted networks {{make use of the}} synchronous arrival of the packets to the routers to minimize locally the number of deflections. In this paper, we show that the difference in performances between slotted and <b>unslotted</b> networks is mainly {{due to the fact that}} <b>unslotted</b> networks cannot easily perform such local optimization.

The system is an-alyzed for two cases: 1) systems without channel load sensing pro-tocol (CLSP) and 2) systems with CLSP. The bit-error probability and the throughput are obtained {{as a function}} of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) during message transmission, considering the number of overlapped messages and the amount of time overlap. We as-sume that the generation of data messages is Poisson distributed and that the messages are divided into packets before transmis-sion. The system is modeled as a Markov chain under the assump-tion that the number of packets in a message is geometrically dis-tributed with a constant packet length. The throughput variance of the DS/SSMA <b>unslotted</b> ALOHA system with variable length data traffic is obtained as the Reed–Solomon code rate varies.
