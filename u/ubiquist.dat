A hantavirus was detected from organs of the <b>ubiquist</b> roof rat (Rattus rattus) and of the endemic Major's tufted-tailed rat (Eliurus majori). Amazingly, sequence analysis of the S (small), M (medium), and L (large) coding DNA sequence of this virus showed that the Anjozorobe strain (proposed name) was a new genetic variant of Thailand virus (THAIV) that comprises other variants found in Southeast Asia.

40|$|Aim: Lowland/highland and Neotropical/Asian Palaeotropical assemblages of {{myxomycetes}} {{were compared}} to test the null hypothesis that neither species diversity nor species composition differs between the two ecoregions. This can be expected if myxomycetes behave as <b>ubiquists</b> and are capable of unlimited long distance dispersal. Location: Four pairs (lowland/highland) of comprehensive regional surveys encompassing c.   7500 specimens were compared; these represented Neotropical (Yasuni/Maquipucuna in Ecuador; Guanacaste/Monteverde in Costa Rica) and Asian Palaeotropical forests (Cat Tien/Bi Dup Nui Ba in Vietnam; Chiang Mai in Thailand/South Luzon in the Philippines). Methods: Each survey {{was carried out in}} an area characterized by relatively homogenous vegetation consisting of natural or near-natural forests, and incorporated both field collecting and the use of moist chamber cultures, and all observed fructifications were recorded. Analyses of diversity (i. e. richness) and community composition were carried out with EstimateS and R. Results: Between 400 and 2500 records per survey were obtained. Species accumulation curves indicated moderate to nearly exhaustive completeness (70 – 94 % of expected species richness recorded). Multivariate analyses suggest that geographical separation (Neotropic versus Palaeotropic) explained the observed differences in composition of myxomycete assemblages better than habitat differences (lowland versus highland forests). Main Conclusion: Both geographically restricted morphospecies and differences in myxomycete assemblages provide evidence that myxomycetes are not <b>ubiquists</b> but tend to follow the moderate endemicity hypothesis of protist biogeography.

This <b>ubiquist</b> {{occupies}} {{a range of}} natural and anthropic habitats covering a wide geographic span. To gain an insight into L. thermotolerans population diversity and structure, 172 isolates sourced from diverse habitats worldwide were analysed using a set of 14 microsatellite markers. The resultant clustering revealed that the evolution of L. thermotolerans {{has been driven by}} the geography and ecological niche of the isolation sources. Isolates originating from anthropic environments, in particular grapes and wine, were genetically close, thus suggesting domestication events within the species. The observed clustering was further validated by several means including, population structure analysis, F-statistics, Mantel's test and the analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA). Phenotypic performance of isolates was tested using several growth substrates and physicochemical conditions, providing added support for the clustering.

40|$|Parisotoma notabilis is {{the most}} common species of Collembola in Europe and is {{currently}} designated as <b>ubiquist.</b> This species has been extensively used in numerous studies and is considered as well characterized on a morphological ground. Despite the homogeneity of its morphology, the sequencing of the barcoding fragment (5 ' end of COI) for several populations throughout Europe and North America revealed four distinct genetic lineages. The divergence found between these lineages was similar to the genetic distance among other species of the genus Parisotoma included in the analysis. All four lineages have been confirmed by the nuclear gene 28 S. This congruence between mitochondrial and nuclear signals, as well as the geographical distribution pattern of lineages observed in Europe, supports the potential specific status of these lineages. Based on specimens from the type locality (Hamburg), the species name was successfully assigned to one of these lineages. This finding raises several problems as Parisotoma notabilis has been widely used in many ecological studies. Accumulation of new data for the different lineages detected, especially ecological information and life history traits, is needed to help resolve this situation...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBetween June 2001 and December 2002, 18 hyporheic and {{groundwater}} bores were sampled for fauna and environmental data using phreatic traps. The bores were situated {{in three different}} natural geographic regions in Palatinate, Southwestern Germany. Faunal data correlated with the relative amount of detritus, bacterial abundances and the standard deviation of temperature, while very few and weak correlations were found with physical–chemical variables. Dissolved oxygen {{was assumed to be}} a limiting factor for most metazoans with a critical concentration at around 0. 5 – 1 mgl− 1. To quantify the strength of the hydrological exchange with surface water and its effects on fauna, a so-called GW-Fauna-Index was developed and calculated using the relative amount of detritus, standard deviation of temperature, and oxygen concentration. From all environmental data and on all spatial scales, this index best explained the total faunal abundance and taxonomic richness. To describe the availability of organic aliments in the groundwater, the terms of “alimonic” and “alimony” [from lat. alimonium=(food) supply] were proposed. Although stygofauna was different in the geographic regions investigated, the GW-Fauna-Index was independent from these regional particularities. Using the GW-Fauna-Index, three groups of groundwater habitats could be classified according to the alimonic conditions. From oligo-alimonic group I samples, fauna was mostly absent, while meso-alimonic group II samples were prevailingly populated by stygobites, and eu-alimonic group III samples by <b>ubiquists</b> and stygoxenes. Total abundances and taxonomic richness increased significantly from group I to group III. Group I samples were characterized by low index values, group II samples by intermediate and group III samples by high values. The GW-Fauna-Index provides promising perspectives for application, but needs some improvement. First of all, detritus should be analysed quantitatively and qualitatively, rather than semi-quantitatively. Also, a standard protocol for sampling has to be developed...|$|R
40|$|On alpine {{pastureland}} {{the decline}} in large-bodied earthworm numbers and biomass after abandonment of management might {{be the result of}} a shift from highly palatable grass litter to poorly digestible leaf litter of dwarf shrubs. To test this hypothesis, we analysed nitrogen, phosphorous and total phenolic contents of fresh and aged litter of eight commonly occuring alpine plant species and compared consumption rates of these food sources in a controlled feeding experiment with Lumbricus rubellus (Lumbricidae). Furthermore, we analysed the microbial community structure of aged litter materials to check for a relationship between the microbial characteristics of the different plant litter types and the food choice of earthworms. Plant litters differed significantly in their chemical composition, earthworms, however, showed no preference for any litter species, but generally rejected fresh litter material. Microbial community structures of the litter types were significantly different, but we could find no evidence for selective feeding of L. rubellus. We conclude that L. rubellus is a widespread, adaptable <b>ubiquist,</b> which is able to feed on a variety of food sources differing in quality and palatability, {{as long as they have}} been exposed to wheathering...|$|E
40|$|Crepidula fornicata (Linné 1758) is {{a marine}} {{gastropod}} {{belonging to the}} family Calyptraeidae (Blainville 1824). Hoagland (1977), in her systemat-ic study of the family, suggested retaining this com-monly-used term rather than the family name Crepidulidae (Fleming 1822) which refers only to the genus Crepidula (Lamarck 1799). This benthic gastropod, which is commonly called slipper limpet, bears a calcareous and slightly spiralled shell about 6 cm long. It is a suspension-feeder, filtering phytoplankton and particulate organic matter. This feeding mode allows it to find sufficient food to develop large populations, unlike other grazing patellids (Hoagland, 1977). Along European coasts, this species is an oyster pest. It is generally found on the coastal infralittoral grounds, but stranded populations can be observed on {{the lower part of}} certain exposed shores.

40|$|Dimethylsulfide (DMS), dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), and {{dimethylsulfoxide}} (DMSO) cycling in {{the surface}} ocean has an important impact on the biogenic sulfur loading of the atmosphere. Calcifying phytoplankton, such as the <b>ubiquist</b> coccolithophorids, are import producers of the DMS precursor DMSP. Thus, the effect of increasing pCO 2 and consequential acidification of the ocean might impact the sulfur cycle in the future both in the ocean and in the atmosphere. Several studies were performed to investigate the elevated pCO 2 effect on DMS and DMSP. However, the results have not built consensus, in fact many are contradictory. During SOPRAN II, DMS, DMSP and DMSO concentrations were measured in a mesocosm study in Bergen (Norway) which investigated the consequences of ocean acidification. With increasing pCO 2 the DMS and DMSP concentrations decreased up to four times and up to a factor of 1. 3, respectively. The DMSO concentrations also decreased; however, the effect was small. Emiliania huxleyi, a coccolithophorid alga, declined in their cell abundance and {{this might be the}} reason for low DMSP and DMS concentrations. However, other algae species, zooplankton and bacteria, which are also more or less affected by ocean acidification, might likewise influence the concentrations of the sulfur compounds.

No such study for the entire area has been published till now. At present a total of 134 species of snakes, belonging to 159 taxa, is known. Only 19. 4 % is endemic, the majority (43. 4 %) belong to species with an Amazonian distribution. Seventeen species (12. 7 %) are venemous, ten belonging to the Elapidae, seven to the Crotalidae. Several taxonomic problems are discussed, Cercophie auratus (Schlegel) is restored as a valid taxon and redescribed. Analysis of available distribution data shows that forest snakes are fairly evenly distributed throughout Amazonia and Guiana. Snakes restricted to open formations are spread evenly throughout Guiana, but most of them are absent in western Amazonia. When taking together <b>ubiquists</b> and snakes restricted to open formations there is a fair resemblance between the faunas of Guiana and.

40|$|PASTORAL CULTIVATION - FRENCH PASTORAL REGIONS - We shall study {{successively}} :A) Where {{the pastoral}} regions are found. B) The soil, climate and vegetation of these regions. A) We find summer pastures, pasturages and grass-lands inall {{parts of the}} mountain, but chiefly in the higher regions. Allthe alpine floor is pastoral by reason of its natural destination(pastoral vocation). Besides that, man has cleared certain partsof the subalpine floor and even of the mountain floor in orderto make pasture — and grass-lands of them. These lands, wrested from the forest are also pastoral regionsfrom our point of view, not by their natural conditions, butby reason of their economic destination. If they play their partproperly and if their upkeep does not endanger the stabilityand prosperity of the mountain, we should conserve them. B) The soil of the pasture lands and summer pastures is theresult of the breaking-up of the rocks which make up our Frenchmountains. Its relief is according to the greater or lesser solidityof the rocks and their tectonic disposition. Its richnessdepends {{on the kind of}} rock (granite, marl, lime-stone, basalt,etc [...] .). It is therefore necessary to study geology in order to have aclear idea {{of the value of the}} pastures. This study is long andcomplicated; we will sum it up by saying that the geologicalstrata which include hard or soft lime-stones and marls in hori. zontal or nearly horizontal strata will make excellent pasturelands,either for cows (lias), or for sheep (plateaus "urgoniens"). Granite and gneiss are generally covered with scanty grass,with little varying floral vegetation. The climate of the pastoral regions is to be considered aboveall from the point of view of atmospheric precipitations. Thetotal annual rain-fall would always be sufficient to assure a goodgrowth of grass, if the seasonal division of rain did not varyconsiderably according to whether one is in the mediterraneanregion (dry Alps, Eastern Pyrenees), or in the rest of France(moist Alps, remainder of the Pyrenees, Massif Central, Jura,Vosges). The vegetation can be considered either from the botanicalpoint of view or from the utilitarian one. From the botanicalpoint of view, it is not what it ought normally to be. The floralcomposition of the grass is modified all the time by the actionof live-stock (more or less intensive pasturage), of man (irrigation,laying-down of manure), of running water, etc [...] . Fromthe utilitarian point of view we divide the plants of the pastoralregion into :A) Plants requiring attention and propagation; these arethe plants fit for fodder.

40|$|The {{results of}} a study on spatial and {{temporal}} distribution of macro-invertebrates in the soft sediments of the entire Zeeschelde, i. e. the Belgian part of the Schelde estuary are presented in this report. This study, part of the OMES-program (Study on Environmental Impact of the Sigma plan), {{has been carried out}} at the University of Gent (Prof. M. Vincx) in close cooperation with the Institute of Nature Conservation (Prof. P. Meire), in the period November 1995 – June 1998. It focussed on those aspects that were insufficiently understood from previous studies on benthic invertebrates of this area, such as the distribution of faunal elements in the freshwater tidal area, with special attention for the dominant taxon of Oligochaeta. Material was derived from a single extensive sampling campaign at 143 stations on 35 transects along the entire salinity- and depth gradient of the Zeeschelde in September/October 1996 and from monthly campaigns at four selected permanent stations: two in freshwater intertidal area (Ballooi, Appels), one in the shallow subtidal freshwater zone (Mariekerke) and one at a mesohaline intertidal flat (Groot Buitenschoor: GBR). A first step towards experimental work on the bioturbating activity of Oligochaeta in the freshwater sediments of the Zeeschelde, was taken. From these data it is shown that the Zeeschelde sediments are characterised by three clearly distinct benthic communities, all dominated or codominated by oligochaetes. Oligochaetes are codominant (0 - 30 % of total density subtidally, 60 - 90 % intertidally) in the b-mesohalinicum (Belgian-Dutch border up to Antwerpen) with other taxa (particularly Polychaeta, Amphipoda and Mollusca). They are the only dominant benthic taxon (> 95 %) in the freshwater tidal area. The b-mesohaline zone is characterised by a species assemblage comparable to the one found in other West-European estuaries. Oligochaeta are represented here by the tubificids Heterochaeta costata and Tubificoides heterochaetus and the naidids Paranais litoralis and Amphichaeta sannio. The freshwater species Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri and Tubifex tubifex were found only once at the GBR-station, i. e. in November when peak numbers are counted in the freshwater tidal zone, and at a surprisingly great depth with respect to their size (escape behaviour high salinity values). Total densities of oligochaetes are much lower here than in the freshwater tidal area (mean density: 20, 000 m - 2) and increase with increasing exposition. Also the other soft-bottom invertebrate taxa are much more abundant on the intertidal flats than in the strongly dynamic gullies. The opposite is true for species such as Nereis succinea, Balanus improvisus, Polydora ligni and Boccardia redeki, most of them being inhabitants of hard substrates. The oligohaline zone (Rupelmonde-Antwerpen), coinciding with the maximum turbidity zone, is very poor in terms of invertebrate life, with only minor numbers of oligochaetes (freshwater species L. hoffmeisteri and T. tubifex and the euryhaline P. litoralis) and polychaetes (B. redeki). In the freshwater tidal area, very dense populations of tubificids occur, with peak densities amounting to 3. 106 m - 2 and maximal biomasses of 25. 7 g ash-free dry weight m - 2. Those “mass populations” of oligochaetes constitute mainly of the <b>ubiquists</b> L. hoffmeisteri and T. tubifex, and smaller numbers of L. claparèdeianus, L. udekemianus and L. profundicola. The latter three become increasingly more important where oxygen conditions are somehow improved (Gent-Dendermonde). Two naidids (Nais elinguis and Paranais frici) and one tubificid (Potamothrix hammoniensis) were found in spring – early summer only, when algal mats emerge on the tidal flats (Appels) and oxygen conditions are most favourable (March-May). Other freshwater species rarely found in the Zeeschelde are: Dero digitata, Spirosperma ferox, Potamothrix bavaricus, Quistadrilus multisetosus, Ilyodrilus templetoni and Enchytraeidae spec. The total number of oligochaete species identified from the Zeeschelde so far amounts to 18. Oligochaetes were detected in 85 % of all freshwater stations, with as dominant species: L. hoffmeisteri (87 %), T. tubifex (65 %), L. claparèdeianus (62 %), L. udekemianus (45 %) and L. profundicola (37 %). More stations without Oligochaeta were found in the brackish part and the mean frequency of occurrence was much lower here (43 %), with each of the dominant species found in less than one third of the stations: T. heterochaetus (28 %), H. costata (19 %) and P. litoralis (6 %). The relative importance of the smaller fraction (> 250 µm and L. hoffmeisteri and T. tubifex are found in mixed populations (60 % of the former, 30 % of the latter species and 10 % other Limnodrilus species), T. tubifex appears to become particularly dominant in the finest, elevated sediments. Whereas the species spectrum is predominantly determined by the salinity regime (and to a lesser extent by oxygen conditions), the abundance of Oligochaeta in the Zeeschelde is mainly linked to sediment characteristics, with the highest values associated with “fluid muds” in intertidal sedimentation areas. The benthic fauna in the freshwater tidal zone of the Zeeschelde is comparable to those of other hypertrophic, oxygen deficient freshwater systems. The mesohaline part shows similarities with brackish parts of other European estuaries. More than 95 % of all oligochaetes were found in the top 10 cm of the sediment and more than 90 % in the top 7 cm. Naididae that often swim and rely on algae and diatoms, are restricted to the top 1 - 2 cm. In Tubificidae, we could demonstrate a correlation of the depth of occurrence (of the heads) with the length of the animal and hence with the reproductive age and species: juveniles dominate in the upper layers, mature specimens on average at about 5 cm depth and all other stages in between. That explains why species reproducing the year round such as L. hoffmeisteri and L. claparèdeianus (with always reasonable numbers of small immatures and/or juveniles), occur on average shallower than for instance T. tubifex and L. udekemianus, species with more delimited reproductive periods. At the brackish water station GBR there are indications that tubificids move vertically as a response to variations in temperature or oxygen conditions. The temporal pattern in numbers of oligochaetes differs according to the salinity regime. At the brackish GBR-station, populations of the dominant tubificids H. costata and T. heterochaetus do not fluctuate strongly in terms of biomass but show reproductive density peaks in July-December. The naidids A. sannio and P. litoralis are common in spring and dissappear completely in late summer-early autumn. In contrast, the freshwater stations show a uniform pattern with an increasing population size from May-June onwards, a peak in late summer (September/October) and a sudden population crash {{in the first half of}} the winter. Possible explanations for this are discussed, with special attention to the potential role of oligochaetes as food for thousands of ducks. The very fast recolonisation of the Ballooi tidal flat after a period of severe frost in December 1996 – January 1997 is linked to the strong dispersion potentials of oligochaetes and the restocking from deeper waters. Population-dynamics of the dominant species of oligochaetes are discussed and reproductive periods determined: H. costata (April-July), T. heterochaetus (May-August), A. sannio (December and May), P. litoralis (April-June). Although the limnetic species T. tubifex and L. hoffmeisteri are sexually active throughout the year, both species appear to have two ‘generations’ per year, with the peak in reproduction 1 - 2 months later in L. hoffmeisteri (September-October and spring) than in T. tubifex (July-August and late winter). Vorticellidae are frequently encountered as epizoic organisms on tails of limnetic oligochaete species, with a preference for large specimens of L. udekemianus and T. tubifex, and for relatively elevated, silty stations in the upper part of the Zeeschelde. Increasing rates of regeneration in oligochaetes suggest an increase in fish predation towards the Belgian-Dutch border. Tail-cropping appeared to be species- as well as size dependent, and increases with exposure time. This supports the hypothesis that the most elevated parts of the Zeeschelde intertidal flats are visited by fish during flood, taking advantage of the mass occurrence of oligochaete (tails). Alternatively waterfowl might be responsible for the tail-cropping, although research on the birds indicated that the cumulative foraging intensity is not higher on the elevated parts of the flats than deeper down. The impact of oligochaetes on many processes at the sediment-water interface is discussed and the results of some initial experiments with limnetic Zeeschelde tubificids are described. It is shown that densities as found in this part of the Zeeschelde are capable of actively displacing organically enriched layers to deeper regions (at a rate of ca. 1 cm per month) resulting in thicker, looser ‘bands’ of organic material (increase in thickness: 1 cm per two months). Remarkably high values of exopolymers (EPS) found in the experimental sediments could not be linked to worm activity. Finally we made an attempt to predict the changes in benthic communities with improved water conditions and a substantial decline in organic input. An increase in number of oligochaete species, the appearance/increase in other limnetic taxa (f. i. : Chironomids, Pisidium,…) and a reduction in the productivity of the oligochaetes is expected in the freshwater tidal area. In the oligohaline zone that is currently almost devoid of life due to oxygen deficiency, potentials are available for the development of benthic communities with representatives of the brackish and the freshwater area...|$|R
40|$|Based on a {{literature}} survey and {{the identification of}} all available collection material, a checklist and distribution maps for the caddisflies occurring in Flanders were prepared. Of the 126 species that have been recorded, 16 arc now extinct in Flanders, {{while the majority of}} the remaining species is rare and their populations are often vulnerable due to isolation. Caddisflies only occurred at high oxygen levels and relatively low conductivities and three species assemblages could be recognized. A first group of species lived in stagnant waters and those species tolerated slightly lower oxygen concentrations than species characteristic for running waters. In streams of the Campine region, which are characterized by a low pH and a low conductivity, a second group of species was found. The last group of species mainly occurred in the loamy region, where pH and conductivity are higher. Running waters in other ecoregions mainly contained <b>ubiquist</b> species and did not possess a characteristic species assemblage. Despite the fact that the ecological water quality in Flanders slightly increased during the last few decades, the ecological water quality of most waters is still too low for caddisflies.

A corresponding diamond diagram is used to interpret the transport mode and {{the energy of the}} sedimentary environment. The Aalter Formation (middle Eocene), which was deposited in a quiet to turbulent setting, contains high amounts of ubiquists, parametamorphic minerals and garnets, with a minor epidote and amphibole content. The Maldegem Formation (middle to late Eocene) of deltaic origin, is characterized by the dominance of ubiquists, particularly in the sands and silts. Garnets, parametamorphic minerals and small amounts of epidotes also occur. The heavy mineral {{distribution of}} the Zelzate Formation (late Eocene), an intertidal sand flat deposit, {{is similar to that of}} the Maldegem Formation, although it contains fewer parametamorphic minerals and more epidote and amphibole. Intrastratal dissolution of garnet due to subaerial weathering or continuous ground water flows occurred under shallow burial of the Maldegem and Zelzate formations in part of the study area. On the basis of paleogeographical considerations, it is concluded that the Middle and Upper Eocene sediments were supplied by a precursor of the Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta sourced from western European massifs.

3000|$|The acute {{toxicity}} approach (less {{than a month}} of investigations on rodents with high doses) may give effects which are more proportional to the dose, as it might correspond to a rapid poisoning of the animals, generally with force-fed experiments. However, for many pesticide studies in the scientific literature, some long-term side effects of pesticides at environmental doses are described, which are not apparent in short-term experiments [30]. Classical toxicology is quite often based {{on the concept of}} revealing linear dose-responses as defined by Paracelsus, which generally fails to evidence U or J curves observed after hormonal sex-specific disruptions. Moreover, the effects of mixtures are also neglected in long-term studies, when supposed active principles of pesticides are not assessed with their adjuvants, which also are present as residues in GMOs. Such pesticides may have the capacity to disrupt the [...] "cell web", i.e., to interfere with a signaling pathway, and this could be unspecific. For instance Roundup is known to disrupt the EPSPS in plants, but is also known to interact with the mammalian <b>ubiquist</b> reductase [21] common and essential to cytochromes P 450, a wide class of detoxification enzymes. The so-called Roundup active principle, glyphosate, acts in combination with adjuvants to increase glyphosate-mediated toxicity[21, 31], and this may apply to other environmental pollutants [22]. Moreover, all new metabolites in edible Roundup ready GMOs, as acetyl-glyphosate for the new GAT GMOs, have not been assessed for their chronic toxicity [11], and we consider this as a major oversight in the present regulations.|$|E
40|$|Proceedings of the 18 th ICAR, 26 - 30 June 2016, Tours, FranceThis review {{focuses on}} the role of the {{dialogue}} between the oocyte and its companion somatic cells in driving folliculogenesis from the primordial to the preovulatory follicle stage. Mouse and sheep genetic models have brought complementary evidence of these cell interactions and their consequences for ovarian function. In mouse, deletion of genes encoding connexins have shown that functional gap junction channels between oocytes and granulosa cells and between granulosa cells themselves maintain the follicle in a functionally integrated state. Targeted deletions in oocytes or granulosa cells have revealed the cell- and stage-specific role of <b>ubiquist</b> factors belonging to the phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase signaling pathway in primordial follicle activation, oocyte growth and follicle survival. Various models of transgenic mice and sheep carrying natural loss-of-function mutations associated with sterility have established that the oocyte-derived factors, BMP 15 and GDF 9, orchestrate follicle development, support cumulus metabolism and maturation and participate in oocyte meiosis arrest. Unexpectedly in sheep, mutations resulting in the attenuation of BMP signaling lead to enhanced ovulation rate, likely resulting from a lowered follicular atresia rate and the enhancement of FSH-regulated follicular maturation. Both the activation level of BMP signaling and an adequate equilibrium between BMP 15 and GDF 9 determine follicle survival, maturation and development towards ovulation. The physiological approaches which were implemented on genetic animal models during the last 20 years have opened up new perspectives for female fertility by identifying the main signaling pathways of the oocyte-somatic cell dialogue...|$|E

Although efforts {{have been made to}} assess the indirect, soil mediated ecological effects of acid rain, a systematic assessment of the direct foliage injury by acid rain across terrestrial plants is lacking. Leaf chlorophyll content is an important indicator of direct foliage damage and strongly related to plant productivity. We synthesized data from published literature on experiments of simulated acid rain, by directly exposing plants to acid solutions with varying pH levels, to assess the direct effect of acid rain on leaf chlorophyll content across 67 terrestrial plants in China. Our results indicate that acid rain substantially reduces leaf chlorophyll content by 6. 71 % per pH unit across the recorded plant species. The direct reduction of leaf chlorophyll content due to acid rain exposure showed no significant difference across calcicole, <b>ubiquist</b> or calcifuge species, implying that soil acidity preference does not influence the sensitivity to leaf injury by acid rain. On average, the direct effects of acid rain on leaf chlorophyll on trees, shrubs and herbs were comparable. The effects, however varied across functional groups and economic use types. Specifically, leaf chlorophyll content of deciduous species was more sensitive to acid rain in comparison to evergreen species. Moreover, vegetables and fruit trees were more sensitive to acid rain than other economically used plants. Our findings imply a potential production reduction and economic loss due to the direct foliage damage by acid rain. </p...|$|E

Using a logistic regression model, we first evaluated which land cover variables determined the presence of Culex and Anopheles larva. The resulting probability map of larval presence then was used to project the average probability of finding adults in a buffer area. This was compared to the actual number of adults collected, providing a quantitative assessment of adult dispersal ability for each species. Results The distribution of Cx. modestus and An. melanoon is mainly driven by the repartition of irrigated farm fields and reed beds, their specific breeding habitats.

[...] 2 pages, 4 figuresProchlorococcus is the {{smallest}} and most abundant photosynthetic organism known on Earth and a major contributor of ocenic primary production. This cianobacterium is <b>ubiquist</b> in every ocean from 40 °N to 40 °S, from surface to 200 m depth in the water column, reaching abundances close to 10 cells/mL worldwide [1]. Its large surface/volume ratio gives it a high efficiency for light and nutrients capture. On the other hand, this characteristics also implicate a higher intake and a faster bioconcentration of pollutants, resulting in an extreme sensitivity {{to a variety of}} environmental stressors, from UV radiation to organic pollutants [2]. Therefore, Prochlorococcus constitutes an excellent sentinel organism to evaluate the dependence of the photosynthetic function to environmental variables and anthropogenic impacts in middle latitudinal oceans. Over the past century the global phytoplankton concentration has declined and changes in chlorophyll and primary production have been detected, which has been attributed to the impact of global climate change [3]. Global Change is a set of interlinked vectors, being one of the best studied the climate change. Neverthelees, the only vector whose global impact has not been quantifyed yet is chemical pollution [4]. In this way, the main objective of the present work was to measure the photosynthetic capacity of Prochlorococcus in Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans during the Malaspina circumnavigation, and study its relationship with the concentrations of diverse organic pollutants.

Being a main global primary producer and <b>ubiquist</b> in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world’s oceans [2], it constitutes a good sentinel species for evaluating the effect of environmental stressors on oceanic photosynthesis. We developed a sensitive method to monitor the expression of two genes responsible of photosynthesis in Prochlorococcus, rbcL (RuBisCO) and psbA (D 1 protein), using rnpB as reference gene [3, 4]. We applied the method to samples from 63 stations of the Malaspina circumnavigation cruise (December 2010 - July 2011), sampled at three depths. In addition, natural communities of nano-and picoplankton were experimentally exposed to organic pollutant mixtures. Expression of Prochlorococcus rbcL and psbA genes correlated with several physical variables and other biological measurements, and were sensitive to low levels of organic pollutant mixtures. We consider these sublethal effects on the photosynthesis, together with already known effects at cellular level [5, 6], are significant potential perturbators of the oceanic carbon cycle.

The correct coordination of imaging and needle placement {{was in charge of the}} operator. His or her experience and skill accounted for a successful treatment. This study dealt with the evaluation of the new developped optical navigation assistant NaviBiopsy on a biopsy phantom. NaviBiopsy was compared to well established methods of ultrasound guided biopsies. These were the freehand technique and the mechanically guided technique. The first experiment was about an unexperienced operator who biopted 50 peas with each of the three methods. The peas were embedded at 3 cm in a paraffin matrix. Biopsy times, Hitting scores and the number of feed motions of the needle were analyzed. Only one needle feeding was needed in 100 % when using NaviBiopsy, in 90 % when using mechanical device and in 58 % when using the freehand technique. The score-rate was 100 % for NaviBiopsy and the mechanical device. The freehand technique was less effective with 92 %. Time differences were not significant. Similarly the second experiment dealt with pea-biopsies in a gel-matrix. Contrary to the first experiment the biopsies were performed by 5 experienced operators. 20 peas were biopted with each of the 3 methods. The second difference was about time measurement. The time for one biopsy was divided in an aim-time (from the start until the needle was put into the matrix) and biopsy-time (until the end of the biopsy procedure). Again there was a better score-rate for all operators (Method 1 = 88 %; 2 = 92 %; 3 = 98 %) and a higher rate of one time needle feeding (Method 1 = 84 %; 2 = 80 %; 3 = 92 %). Two operators who dealt with navigation systems before had shorter aim- and biopsy-times with NaviBiopsy. The 5 operators filled in a questionnaire to valuate the NaviBiopsy system. The valuation of the two navigation-experienced operators was better though all operators had better hit-scores and precision with NaviBiopsy. The time-differences between the 3 methods were not relevant for clinical workflow. On the other hand the individual time profile was reflected by the subjective valuation which was similar to the time-ranking. The usability and the efficacy of NaviBiopsy could be proved by this study. The handling of the components was intuitive and the biopsies were performed with better quality. Our own results were supported by recent literature. Especially the unexperienced operator profited from the navigation device. In view of the great importance of ultrasound guided biopsies for all medical scopes this was a circumstance of importance for our patients. For instance the diagnosis of malignant tumours could be accelerated if the first diagnosing doctor was enabled to perform a needle biopsy by him/ herself. The low rate of complications in ultrasound guided biopsies could be even reduced and targets which were hard to reach with this technique before could become accessible. Overall the navigation device for ultrasound guided biopsies was a forward-looking technique, which was worth to be established in medical use...|$|E
40|$|During ODP Leg 123, {{abundant}} and well-preserved Neocomian radiolarians were recovered at Site 765 (Argo Abyssal Plain) and Site 766 (lower Exmouth Plateau). Assemblages {{are characterized by}} the numerical dominance of {{a small number of}} non-tethyan forms and by the scarcity of tethyan taxa. Remarkable contrasts exist between radiolarian assemblages extracted from claystones of Site 765 and reexamined DSDP Site 26 1, and faunas recovered from radiolarian sand layers, only found at Site 765. Clay faunas are unusual in their low diversity of apparently ecologically tolerant (or solution resistant?), <b>ubiquist</b> species, whereas sand faunas are dominated by non-tethyan taxa. Comparisons with Sites 766 and 26 1, as well as sedimentological observations, lead to the conclusion that this faunal contrast resulted from a difference in provenance, rather than from hydraulic sorting or selective dissolution. The ranges of 27 tethyan taxa from Site 765 were compared to the tethyan radiolarian zonation by Jud (1992) by means of the Unitary Associations Method. This calculation allows to directly date the Site 765 assemblages and to estimate the amount of truncation of ranges for tethyan taxa. Over 70 % of the already few tethyan species of Site 765, have truncated ranges during the Valanginian-Hauterivian. Radiolarian assemblages recovered from claystones at Sites 765 and 261 in the Argo Basin apparently reflect restricted oceanic conditions during the latest Jurassic-Barremian. Neither sedimentary facies nor faunal associations bear any resemblance to what we know from typical tethyan sequences. We conclude that the Argo Basin was paleoceanographically separated from the Tethys during the Late Jurassic and part of the Early Cretaceous by its position at higher paleolatitudes and/or by enclosing land masses. Assemblages recovered from radiolarian sand layers are dominated by non-tethyan species that are interpreted as circumantarctic. Their first appearance in the late Berriasian-early Valanginian predates the oceanization of the Indo-Australian breakup (M 11, late Valanginian), but coincides with a sharp increase in margin-derived pelagic turbidites. The Indo-Australian rift zone and the adjacent margins must have been submerged deeply enough to allow an intermittent influx of circumantarctic cold water into the Argo Basin, creating increased bottom current activity. Cold-water radiolarians carried into the Argo Basin upwelled along the margin, died, and accumulated in radiolarite layers due to winnowing by bottom currents. High rates of faunal change and the sharp increase of bottom current activity are thought to be synchronous with possible pronounced late Berriasian-early Valanginian lowstands in sea level. Hypothetically, both phenomena might have been. caused by a tendency to glaciation on the Antarctic-Australian continent, which was for the first time isolated from the rest of Gondwana by oceanic seaways as a result of Jurassic-Early Cretaceous sea-floor spreading. The absence of most typical tethyan radiolarian species during the Valanginian-Hauterivian is interpreted as reflecting a time of strong influx of circumantarctic cold water following oceanization (M 11) and rapid spreading between Southeast India and West Australia. The reappearance and gradual abundance/diversity increase of tethyan taxa, along with the still dominant circumantarctic species are thought to result from overall more equitable climatic conditions during the Barremian-early Aptian and from the establishment of an oceanic connection with the Tethys Ocean during the early Aptian...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe aims of {{this study}} are to {{characterize}} the spatial variability of biomarker imprints in a peatland and to test to which extent this variability can be related to the surrounding vegetation. Since the mid 1970 ’s La Guette peatland (région Centre, France) has been colonized by vascular plants. Nowadays it is totally colonized by Molina caerulea and, to varying extent, by Pinus sylvestris and Betula pendula. In nine stations representative of distinct vegetation cover, we analysed the lipid composition of soil developed under Molinia caerulea. The lipids of the six most abundant plants encountered in the peatland were analysed as reference samples: Sphagnum rubellum, Erica tetralix, Calluna vulgaris, Molinia caerulea, Betula pendula and Pinus sylvestris. For all these samples, lipids were ultrasonically extracted with DCM and then separated into neutral, acidic and polar compounds. The neutral fraction was further separated by flash chromatography to afford (i) aliphatics and aromatics; (ii) ethers, esters, ketones and acetates and (iii) alcohols. 5 α-cholestane was added prior to analysis for quantitation. Lipid fractions were then identified and quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In order to quantify their density, trees were counted within circles of increasing radius (giving areas of 3. 14; 12. 6; 28. 3; 50. 3 and 78. 5 m 2) around the sampling plot. After counting, total tree density was determined as well as individual P. sylvestris and B. pendula density. For each sample (n= 9) regressions were calculated between (i) lipids and (ii) the density of the tree (n= 9). This calculation was reproduced for each counting surface. Then, the resulting regression coefficient was plotted against each surface of counting. Apart from <b>ubiquist</b> compounds such as n-alkanes and triterpenoid ketones, we found in soils several biomarkers for which the source could be constrained. Taraxeryl, friedelanyl and moretenyl acetates were detected. Friedelanyl and moretenyl acetates were found in high amounts in open vegetation plots (9. 7 and 2. 9 µg. g soil- 1, respectively). They were also detected in E. tetralix and C. vulgaris (Ericaceae) and, probably due to contamination, in S. rubellum. Multiflorenyl and two unknown acetates, also present in low contents, may originate from undetermined, less abundant plant. Four methoxy-serratenes (Le Milbeau et al., 2013) and seven tricyclic diterpenes were detected in both soils and P. sylvestris needles. Strong correlation (r = 0. 997; p ≤ 0. 0001) of their respective abundances in soils attest to their common origin and similar conservation potential. The presence of betulin and related compounds in soil samples and in B. pendula leaves are in agreement with the admitted use of these biomarkers to track the former presence Betula species in soils and sediments (i. e. Otto and Simoneit, 2001). The source of these biomarkers being defined, we then assessed their spatial distribution at the nine sampling sites. Although not abundant, triterpenyl acetates, methoxy-serratenes, diterpenes and betulin derivatives exhibit a higher coefficient of variation along sampling sites than other compound such as n-alkanes or triterpenoid ketones. The correlation between methoxy-serratenes and the number of P. sylvestris in the nine sampling sites increases with the surface used for the calculation (r = 0. 93, p< 0. 022). These values indicate that specific biomarkers of P. sylvestris in soil samples and surrounding vegetation are spatially linked. The same applies for B. pendula and betulin derivatives (r = 0. 96, p< 0. 008). The degradability of the betulin and its relatively high solubility may induce lost and leaching out of the sampling point. Our results provide evidence that selected biomarkers in soil samples can give a reliable picture of the surrounding vegetation. It also quantifies the area of influence of trees on the soil lipid composition, over 20 m². The approach combining tree counting and quantitation of specific biomarkers that was developed in the frame {{of this study}} proved to be efficient in evidencing the spatial control of the surrounding vegetation on lipids distribution in a peatland invaded by vascular plants.

40|$|PCBs {{are among}} the most {{problematic}} marine contaminants. Converging towards the oceans via the rivers and the atmosphere, they concentrate in sediments where they become a permanent threat to organisms living at their contact. PCBs are extremely resistant, bioaccumulated and some congeners are considered as highly toxic. The North Sea is considered as a highly contaminated area;however little information is available regarding the impact of PCBs on key benthic organisms of this region. <b>Ubiquist,</b> abundant and generally recognized as a good bioindicator species, the common NE Atlantic sea star Asterias rubens (L.) is an ecosystem-structuring species in the North Sea and was chosen as an experimental model. The present study focused on the characterization of PCB bioaccumulation in A. rubens exposed through different routes (seawater, food, sediments) and on subsequent biological responses, at immune and sucellular levels. The considered responses were respectively (i) the production of reactive oxyggen species (ROS) by sea stars amoebocytes, which constitutes the main line of defence of echinoderms against pathogenic challenges and (ii) the induction of a cytochrome P 450 immunopositive protein (CYP 1 A IPP) which, in vertebrates, is involved in PCB detoxification. Experimental exposures carried out have shown that A. rubens efficiently accumulates PCBs. Exposure concentrations were always adjusted to match those encountered in the field. PCB concentrations reached in sea stars during the experiments matched the values reported in field studies;therefore our experimental protocol was found to accurately simulate actual field situations. Uptake kinetics were related to the planar conformation of the considered congeners :non-coplanar PCB uptake was described using saturation models, whereas coplanar PCBs (c-PCBs) were bioaccumulated according to bell-shaped kinetics. Non-coplanar congeners generally reached saturation concentrations whithin a few days or a few weeks, which means that sea stars can be used to pinpoint PCB contamination shortly after occurrence. On the other hand, c-PCB concentrations reached a peak followed by a sudden drop, indicating the probable occurrence of c-PCB-targeted metabolization processes in sea stars. Our experimental studies also demonstrated that seawater was by far the most efficient route for PCB uptake in sea stars and that even if PCB levels in seawater are extremely low compared to sediment-associated concentrations, seawater constitutes a non-negligible route for PCB uptake in marine invertebrates. Among the different body compartments, bodywall displayed the highest bioaccumulative potency and can therefore be considered as particularly interesting for field biomonitoring applications. Rectal caeca, which {{play a central role in}} digestion and excretion processes in sea stars, have also rised particular interest as results suggest these organs could be involved in the elimination of PCB 77 degradation products. The field work carried out during the present study showed that PCB concentrations measured in A. rubens tissues reflect environmental levels of certain congeners. As it was the case in experimental conditions, A. rubens differentially accumulated PCB congeners according to their planarity. Strong relationships were found between concentrations measured in sediments and those determined in sea stars body wall for certain non-coplanar congeners (e. g. 118 and 138), thus allowing to consider A. rubens as a suitable bioindicator species for medium-chlorinated PCB congeners. On the other hand, sea stars appeared to be able to regulate -to a certain extent- their content in coplanar PCBs. This implies that (i) A. rubens cannot be strictly considered as an indicator organism for c-PCBs and (ii) c-PCBs probably affect essential aspects of sea star biology, potentially leading to deleterious effects. The present study addressed effects of PCB exposure on A. rubens biology, in both experimental and field conditions. In experimental conditions, PCBs were found to significantly alter ROS production by sea stars amoebocytes. This alteration also occurred in a congener-specific way :c-PCBs were found to significantly affect, and probably impair sea stars immune system, whereas non-coplanar congeners had no effect. In the field, the PCB contribution to immunotoxicity could not be determined because none of our studies considered ROS production along with c-PCB concentration measurements. However, the levels of ROS production by sea stars amoebocytes measured in field and experimental conditions were found to potentially lead to altered immunity, and therefore to impair sea stars defence against pathogenic agents. A specially designed ELISA was used to measure CYP 1 A IPP in experimental and field conditions. Experimental work has shown that the induction of this protein was related to PCB exposure in a congener-specific fashion :c-PCBs alone were found to strongly induce the production of CYP 1 A IPP according to a dose-dependent relationship. These results have highlighted many similarities between the dioxin-like responsiveness of CYP 1 A IPP induction in sea stars and that occurring in vertebrates. This strongly suggests similarities in the toxicity-triggering mechanism of dioxins and c-PCBs. In the field, CYP 1 A IPP induction was found to be significantly related to PCB levels determined in bottom sediments. It can thus be considered as a valuable biomarker. Further research is however needed to better characterize the influence of physico-chemical and physiological parameters on CYP 1 A induction to refine the interpretation of the information gathered via this biomarker. Results obtained in our study have lead to questionning international regulations applying to PCB biomonitoring in the marine environment. For instance, we strongly suggest that the selection of congeners to be systematically considered should be revised to include c-PCBs. Indeed, in our experiments PCB toxicity was almost always attributable to the sole c-congeners. Historically, determination of c-PCB concentrations was extremely difficult due to analytical limitations;however, nowadays, these problems have been overcome and do no more justify their exclusion from monitoring studies. Although A. rubens appeared to be quite resistant to PCB contamination, levels measured in sea stars from the southern North Sea can possibly affect their immune and endocrine systems in a subtle way, but with relatively low risk for this species at the short-term. However, this does not mean that other species in this region undergo similarly low risks, or that sea star-structured ecosystems may not become affected in the long-term Doctorat en sciences, Spécialisation biologie animaleinfo:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|E
