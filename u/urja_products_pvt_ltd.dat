The COD: N: P ratio was followed as 100 : 5 : 1 for nutrient feed. The performance of UASBR is reported in terms of % removal of various wastewater characteristics by UASB process. It is observed that the biogas yield of 0. 6 m 3 /m 3 reactor volume/day is sufficient to carry out natural mixing in the reactor. So Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) reactor can be suitable alternatives for treatment of such wastewater to reduce overall operational cost of the treatment. [2...|$|R
30|$|Owing to {{its rich}} {{properties}} {{and variety of}} end-uses, together with increased interests in biopolymer and bio-fuels industries, the potential for castor oil to play a much larger {{role in the world}} economy has increased dramatically in recent years. For instance, trend shows that castor oil prices steadily rose from $ 946 per tonne in 2002 – 2003 to $ 2390 in 2010 – 2011 [5]. The contribution of castor oil on the world economy is expected to continue increasing and it has been predicted that the global castor oil and derivatives market will reach USD 1.81 billion by 2020 [6]. The increased interest of substitution of conventional fuel by bio fuels, volatile crude oil prices, higher demand from Europe, China and the US, and growth of key end-use industries including cosmetics and lubricants are expected to drive the global castor oil and derivatives market. On the other hand, threat from other vegetable oils in terms of price and application, and high dependency on seasonality may hinder the market growth. Some major companies operating in the castor oil and derivatives global market are: Thai Castor Oil Industries Co. Ltd., Jayant Agro Organics, Hokoku Corporation, ITOH Oil Chemicals Co. Ltd., Gokul Overseas, Bom Brazil, Liaoyang Huaxing Chemical Co., Ltd., and Kanak Castor <b>Products</b> <b>Pvt.</b> <b>Ltd</b> [7].|$|R
30|$|In {{the powder}} form of {{chitosan}} (1 %), sebacic acid at different concentrations was mixed, and 20 ml of water {{was added to}} the mixture which was stirred at room temperature until the solution became homogenous. Similarly, collagen (0.5 %) and sebacic acid at different concentrations were mixed in the presence of 20 ml of water and stirred at 4 °C to obtain a clear homogenous solution. The concentration of SA varied between 0.05 % and 0.5 % (w/v). The samples were subjected to centrifugation in order to remove any nonreactive molecules, and a clear solution obtained from centrifugation at 5, 000 rpm for 10 min was poured in Tarsons vials (Tarsons <b>Product</b> <b>Pvt.</b> <b>Ltd.,</b> Kolkata, India), which have an inner diameter of 4.5 cm and frozen at - 4 °C for 2 h, - 20 °C for 12 h, and - 80 °C for another 12 h according to Peng et al. (2006). The frozen samples were lyophilized for 48 h at a vacuum of 7.5 mTorr (1 Pa) and a condenser temperature of - 70 °C (PENQU CLASSIC PLUS, Lark, India). The resultant 3 D scaffold material was neutralized with repeated washings with 0.05 N of NaOH and ethanol mixture, followed by washings with water and ethanol mixture; finally, it was again lyophilized for 24 h. The scaffolds obtained during this procedure were designated as SACCH and SACC. For comparative analysis, GACCH and GACC were prepared according to the method described previously using 0.2 % glutaraldehyde.|$|R
