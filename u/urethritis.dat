5|$|Genital herpes {{can be more}} {{difficult}} to diagnose than oral herpes, since most HSV-2-infected persons have no classical symptoms. Further confusing diagnosis, several other conditions resemble genital herpes, including fungal infection, lichen planus, atopic dermatitis, and <b>urethritis.</b> Laboratory testing is often used to confirm a diagnosis of genital herpes. Laboratory tests include culture of the virus, direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) studies to detect virus, skin biopsy, and polymerase chain reaction to test for presence of viral DNA. Although these procedures produce highly sensitive and specific diagnoses, their high costs and time constraints discourage their regular use in clinical practice.|$|E
5|$|In {{women with}} {{cervicitis}} (inflammation of the cervix) or vaginitis (inflammation of the vagina) and in {{young men with}} UTI symptoms, a Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrheae infection may be the cause. These infections are typically classified as a <b>urethritis</b> rather than a urinary tract infection. Vaginitis may also {{be due to a}} yeast infection. Interstitial cystitis (chronic pain in the bladder) may be considered for people who experience multiple episodes of UTI symptoms but urine cultures remain negative and not improved with antibiotics. Prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) may also be considered in the differential diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Uropathogenic E. coli {{from the}} gut {{is the cause}} of 80–85% of community-acquired urinary tract infections, with Staphylococcus saprophyticus being the cause in 5–10%. Rarely they may be due to viral or fungal infections. Healthcare-associated urinary tract infections (mostly related to urinary catheterization) involve a much broader range of {{pathogens}} including: E. coli (27%), Klebsiella (11%), Pseudomonas (11%), the fungal pathogen Candida albicans (9%), and Enterococcus (7%) among others. Urinary tract infections due to Staphylococcus aureus typically occur secondary to blood-borne infections. Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma genitalium can infect the urethra but not the bladder. These infections are usually classified as a <b>urethritis</b> rather than urinary tract infection.|$|E

25|$|T. vaginalis {{infection}} in males {{has been found}} to cause asymptomatic <b>urethritis</b> and prostatitis. In the prostate, it may create chronic inflammation that may eventually lead to prostate cancer.|$|E
25|$|Reactive {{arthritis}} (previously Reiter's disease) – asymmetrically involves heel, sacroiliac {{joints and}} large joints of the leg. It is {{usually associated with}} <b>urethritis,</b> conjunctivitis, iritis, painless buccal ulcers, and keratoderma blennorrhagica.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of cases during World Wars I and II focused {{attention}} on the triad of arthritis, <b>urethritis,</b> and conjunctivitis (often with additional mucocutaneous lesions), which {{at that time was}} also referred to as Fiessenger-Leroy-Reiter syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Tetracyclines {{remain the}} {{treatment}} of choice for infections caused by chlamydia (trachoma, psittacosis, salpingitis, <b>urethritis</b> and L. venereum infection), Rickettsia (typhus, Rocky Mountain spotted fever), brucellosis and spirochetal infections (borreliosis, syphilis and Lyme disease). In addition, they {{may be used to}} treat anthrax, plague, tularemia and Legionnaires' disease. They are also used in veterinary medicine.|$|E
25|$|A bout of food {{poisoning}} or a gastrointestinal infection may also precede the disease (the last four genera of bacteria mentioned above are enteric bacteria). Shigella {{is the most}} common organism causing reactive arthritis following diarrhea. Chlamydia trachomatis {{is the most common}} cause of reactive arthritis following <b>urethritis.</b> Ureaplasma and mycoplasma are rare causes. There is some circumstantial evidence for other organisms causing the disease, but the details are unclear.|$|E
25|$|The {{main goal}} of {{treatment}} {{is to identify}} and eradicate the underlying infectious source with the appropriate antibiotics if still present. Otherwise, treatment is symptomatic for each problem. Nonspecific <b>urethritis</b> may be treated with a short course of tetracycline. Analgesics, particularly NSAIDs, are used. Steroids, sulfasalazine and immunosuppressants may be needed for patients with severe reactive symptoms that {{do not respond to}} any other treatment. Local corticosteroids are useful in the case of iritis.|$|E
25|$|In the past, some {{research}} suggested that geographic tongue {{was associated with}} diabetes, seborrheic dermatitis and atopy, however newer research does not corroborate these findings. Others suggest allergy as a major factor, e.g. to nickel sulphate. Some studies have reported a link between geographic tongue and psoriasis, although 90% {{of children who are}} diagnosed with geographic tongue do not develop psoriasis. Again however, modern research studies do not support any link between psoriasis and geographic tongue. Lesions that are histologically indistinguishable from geographic tongue may also be diagnosed in reactive arthritis (arthritis, uveitis/conjunctivitis and <b>urethritis).</b>|$|E
25|$|Although Linus Pauling {{is known}} for highly respectable {{research}} in chemistry and biochemistry, he is also known for promoting the consumption of vitamin C in large doses. Pauling wrote multiple books endorsing vitamin C megadosing. Although he claimed and stood firm in his claim that consuming over 1,000mg is helpful for one’s immune system when fighting a head cold, the results of empirical research do not align with this view. Researchers Vitetta, Sali, Paspaliaris, and Reavley (2002) completed a double blind randomized control study with 400 healthy participants. Throughout the 18 month experiment, there were 189 reported cases of head colds. Researchers {{found that there were}} no significant differences between the medication groups, and taking 1,000mg of vitamin C at the first signs of a head cold did not help (Vitetta et al., 2002). There are also some minor yet unwanted ailments associated with vitamin C megadosing. These ailments were first noted in 1981 by Dr. Fong, who said that large doses of vitamin C can cause diarrhea and <b>urethritis</b> for limited amounts of time (Fong, 1981).|$|E
500|$|Upon a pelvic examination, {{cervical}} motion, uterine, or adnexal tenderness will be experienced. [...] Mucopurulent cervicitis and or <b>urethritis</b> may be observed. In {{severe cases}} more testing {{may be required}} such as laparoscopy, intra-abdominal bacteria sampling and culturing, or tissue biopsy.|$|E

2500|$|Most people {{infected}} with trichomonas vaginalis {{do not have}} any symptoms and can be undetected for years. Symptoms experienced include pain, burning or itching in the penis, urethra (<b>urethritis),</b> or vagina (vaginitis). Discomfort for both sexes may increase during intercourse and urination. For women there may also be a yellow-green, itchy, frothy, foul-smelling ("fishy" [...] smell) vaginal discharge. In rare cases, lower abdominal pain can occur. Symptoms usually appear within 5 to 28 days of exposure.|$|E
2500|$|The {{arthritis}} {{often is}} coupled with other characteristic symptoms; {{this has been}} called Reiter's syndrome, Reiter's disease or Reiter's arthritis. [...] The term [...] "reactive arthritis" [...] is increasingly used {{as a substitute for}} this designation because of Hans Conrad Julius Reiter's war crimes with the Nazi Party. The manifestations of reactive arthritis include the following triad of symptoms: an inflammatory arthritis of large joints, inflammation of the eyes in the form of conjunctivitis or uveitis, and <b>urethritis</b> in men or cervicitis in women. Arthritis occurring alone following sexual exposure or enteric infection is also known as reactive arthritis. Patients can also present with mucocutaneous lesions, as well as psoriasis-like skin lesions such as circinate balanitis, and keratoderma blennorrhagicum. Enthesitis can involve the Achilles tendon resulting in heel pain. Not all affected persons have all the manifestations.|$|E
50|$|For {{treatment}} purposes, doctors usually classify infectious <b>urethritis</b> in two categories: gonococcal <b>urethritis,</b> {{caused by}} gonorrhea, and nongonococcal <b>urethritis</b> (NGU).|$|E
50|$|The {{disease is}} {{classified}} as either gonococcal <b>urethritis,</b> caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, or non-gonococcal <b>urethritis</b> (NGU), most commonly caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. NGU, sometimes called nonspecific <b>urethritis</b> (NSU), has both infectious and noninfectious causes.|$|E
5000|$|Infection of the urethra is <b>urethritis,</b> {{said to be}} {{more common}} in females than males. <b>Urethritis</b> is a common cause of dysuria (pain when urinating).|$|E
50|$|Non-gonococcal <b>urethritis</b> (NGU) is {{diagnosed}} {{if a person}} with <b>urethritis</b> has no signs of gonorrhea bacteria on laboratory tests. The most frequent cause of NGU (23%-55% of cases) is C. trachomatis.|$|E

50|$|Ricord {{developed}} an innovative formula {{for the treatment}} of <b>urethritis,</b> largely used at least up to the late 1910s. It consists of a solution containing 1g zinc sulfate, 2g lead acetate, 4g Sydenham laudanum and catechu tincture in 200ml of distilled water. This formula was widely known and employed for the washing of tissue affected by simple <b>urethritis</b> thanks to its astringent and antiseptic properties.|$|E
5000|$|Used in Thailand as main {{ingredient}} in kidney tablets {{to relieve the}} symptoms of cystitis, pyelitis and <b>urethritis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Disorders {{caused by}} C. trachomatis include chlamydia, trachoma, {{lymphogranuloma}} venereum, nongonococcal <b>urethritis,</b> cervicitis, salpingitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and pneumonia.|$|E
50|$|Untreated <b>urethritis</b> {{can lead}} to {{infection}} of the urethral glands, which can in turn result in impeding urethral strictures.|$|E
50|$|A {{urethral}} stricture is a narrowing of the urethra caused by injury, instrumentation, infection and certain non-infectious forms of <b>urethritis.</b>|$|E
