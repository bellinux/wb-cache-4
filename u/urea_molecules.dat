40|$|AbstractBackground: The {{molecular}} {{mechanism of}} urea-induced protein unfolding {{has not been}} established. It is generally thought that denaturation results from the stabilizing interactions of urea with portions of the protein that are buried in the native state and become exposed upon unfolding of the protein. Results: We have performed molecular dynamics simulations of barnase (a 110 amino acid RNase from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens) with explicit water and <b>urea</b> <b>molecules</b> at 300 K and 360 K. The native conformation was unaffected in the 300 K simulations at neutral and low pH. Two of the three runs at 360 K and low pH showed some denaturation, with partial unfolding of the hydrophobic core 2. The first solvation shell has a much higher density of urea molecules(water/urea ratio ranging from 2. 07 to 2. 73) than the bulk (water/urea ratio of 4. 56). About {{one half of the}} first-shell <b>urea</b> <b>molecules</b> are involved in hydrogen bonds with polar or charged groups on the barnase surface, and between 15 % and 18 % of the first-shell <b>urea</b> <b>molecules</b> participate in multiple hydrogen bonds with barnase. The more stably bound <b>urea</b> <b>molecules</b> tend to be in crevices or pockets on the barnase surface. Conclusions: The simulation results indicate that an aqueous urea solution solvates the surface of a polypeptide chain more favorably than pure water. <b>Urea</b> <b>molecules</b> interact more favorably with nonpolar groups of the protein than water does, and the presence of urea improves the interactions of water molecules with the hydrophilic groups of the protein.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the temperature {{effect on the}} structural and dynamical properties (translation, rotation) of an urea/water system at 0. 20 mole fraction of urea. We report the radial distribution functions of like and unlike molecules and conclude that, even at large distances, these molecules are spatially correlated (with respect to their centers of mass). This behavior is interpreted as an indication that <b>urea</b> <b>molecules</b> are not uniformly distributed at a microscopic level. However, the orientational distribution shows that, at long distances, the <b>urea</b> <b>molecules</b> are not orientationally correlated. A strong correlation between <b>urea</b> <b>molecules</b> is observed within the first-shells of neighboring molecules. In view of these results, it is postulated that urea behaves slightly like a nonpolar molecule.

The pure crystalline phase of urea has also been investigated. The 13 C NMR studies have focused on 13 C chemical shift anisotropy and second-order quadrupolar effects (arising from 13 C− 14 N interaction) for the <b>urea</b> <b>molecules</b> and the cyano groups of the α,ω-dicyanoalkanes. Parameters describing these interactions are derived and are discussed in relation to the known structural properties of these materials. Comparison of 13 C chemical shift anisotropies of the cyano carbons and rates of 13 C dipolar dephasing suggest that 1, 4 -dicyanobutane and 1, 5 -dicyanopentane are effectively static, whereas 1, 6 -dicyanohexane has greater mobility. 2 H NMR line shape analysis for the 1, 4 -dicyanobutane/urea-d 4 and 1, 5 -dicyanopentane/urea-d 4 complexes indicates that the only motion of the <b>urea</b> <b>molecules</b> that is effective on the 2 H NMR time scale is a rapid libration about the CO bond over an angular range of about 26 °. For the 1, 6 -dicyanohexane/urea-d 4 inclusion compound, the 2 H NMR line shape is consistent with a motion comprising 180 ° jumps about the CO bond at rates that are intermediate on the 2 H NMR time scale.

Our main concern in {{this paper is to}} analyze the hypothetical signature of the self-aggregation process (strong urea–urea interaction) in the low frequency response. The main hypothesis is the interpretation of the low frequency response of these aqueous solutions as a result of both the spectral contribution of the translation and rotational motions of <b>urea</b> <b>molecules</b> and the spectral contribution of the translation motion of water molecules. The analysis indicates that the signature of the self aggregation in the low frequency response in aqueous solutions is difficult to characterize because it induces a small shift of the spectral densities associated with the translation and rotation motion of solute and water molecules.
