5|$|Multiple {{studies have}} been {{performed}} on data from large populations of children to study {{the relationship between the}} <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaccines</b> containing thiomersal, and autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Almost all of these studies have found no association between thiomersal-containing vaccines (TCVs) and autism, and studies done after the removal of thiomersal from vaccines have nevertheless shown autism rates continuing to increase. The only epidemiologic research that has found a purported link between TCVs and autism has been conducted by Mark Geier, whose flawed research has not been given any weight by independent reviews.|$|E

The successful results of the field trial were maintained by annual booster inoculations.|$|E
25|$|The {{transmission}} from swine {{to humans}} {{is believed to}} occur mainly in swine farms, where farmers are {{in close contact with}} live pigs. Although strains of swine influenza are usually not able to infect humans, this may occasionally happen, so farmers and veterinarians are encouraged to use face masks when dealing with infected animals. The <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaccines</b> on swine to prevent their infection is a major method of limiting swine-to-human transmission. Risk factors that may contribute to swine-to-human transmission include smoking and, especially, not wearing gloves when working with sick animals, thereby increasing the likelihood of subsequent hand-to-eye, hand-to-nose or hand-to-mouth transmission.|$|E
