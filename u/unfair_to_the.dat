5|$|The Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the sport's {{governing}} body, {{refused a}} compromise proposal from Michelin {{to allow a}} chicane to be installed, maintaining that such rule changes would be grossly <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bridgestone-shod teams, who had come prepared with properly working tyres, and that a last-minute change to the track layout would be dangerous in case of crashes. The Michelin teams, unable {{to come to a}} compromise with the FIA, decided not to participate. It was later stated that the Michelin-shod teams could have potentially exposed themselves to criminal liability under Indiana state law had they competed.|$|E
5|$|As the Director-General was {{a public}} officer {{appointed}} by statute to discharge public duties, he was subject to an order of prohibition in an appropriate case. The Court found that on the affidavit evidence produced by the applicants, the Director-General could not reasonably {{have come to the}} conclusion he came to without hearing the applicants' witnesses. He had thus misdirected himself on the law as to the nature of the evidence that was required to be produced to prove the export of the goods. Finally, there had been an insufficient inquiry which had resulted in a failure to take into account relevant considerations, and an investigation that was <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> applicant. The Court therefore made an order of prohibition against the Director-General to prevent him from deducting money from the bankers' guarantees.|$|E
5|$|In {{some cases}} the {{official}} scorer is not given the discretion to decide between awarding a hit to the batter or ruling that he safely reached first base by fielder's choice. If a preceding runner is forced out or if an unforced preceding runner is put out while attempting {{to return to their}} original base, a hit is automatically not credited and the batter by rule is judged to have reached by a fielder's choice. In some situations this rule may appear <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> batter. For example, if the batter is a fast runner, the ball is slowly hit to the third baseman, and an unforced runner from second realizes (too late) that he can not safely advance, the batter-runner will lose the potential hit on a fielder's choice by the third baseman. This occurs regardless of whether the batter-runner would have reached first base with an ordinary effort to put him out.|$|E
5|$|It {{would be}} <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> place <b>the</b> entire weight of many {{comparatively}} small losses upon {{the shoulders of}} one person in such cases.|$|R
5|$|Critics {{dismissed}} meritocracy as a sham, {{arguing that}} it was <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> consider <b>the</b> two streams equivalent for admissions purposes. Though ostensibly open to non-Bumiputra, critics alleged that most who took matriculation were Malays.|$|R
50|$|Firstly, he {{excludes}} any {{players from}} before 1951, {{as he says}} it is <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> judge <b>the</b> abilities of players without having been able to see them for himself, and secondly, his list, being published in the mid 80s excludes most of the people involved in the 1990 Grand Slam.|$|R
25|$|His new decrees, {{although}} <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{majority of}} the indigenous population, proved good for the Guatemalan economy during the Great Depression era, as they increased coffee production across the country.|$|E
25|$|The {{investigation}} was deemed {{to have been}} <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> applicant as the DG, in making his decision, had preferred the evidence offered to him by a crew member and {{an employee of the}} vessel's agent, TTS, without having first fully investigated the evidence adduced by the applicant and his witnesses. If the DG had done so, the evidence submitted by the applicant could have been sufficient to prove that the goods had indeed been exported.|$|E
25|$|Cattle {{have been}} in {{trespass}} on public lands in southern Nevada {{for more than two}} decades. This is <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> thousands of other ranchers who graze livestock in compliance with federal laws and regulations throughout the West. The Bureau of Land Management and the National Park Service have made repeated attempts to resolve this matter administratively and judicially. An impoundment of cattle illegally grazing on public lands is now being conducted as a last resort.|$|E
30|$|Comparing TNT-NN to LH-NNLS {{could be}} {{considered}} <b>unfair</b> due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> age of the LH-NNLS algorithm. We consider the comparison necessary as LH-NNLS is the routine that is most consistently used throughout other published spatial inversions that do not circumvent the computational hurdles described earlier.|$|R
50|$|Closed {{adoption}} {{has been}} increasingly criticized {{in recent years}} as being <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> both <b>the</b> adoptee and his or her birth parents. Some people believe that making the identities of a child's parents quite literally a state secret is a gross violation of human rights. On the other hand, the birth mother may have desired the secrecy because of the circumstances of the child's conception.|$|R
5|$|Morgan appealed his {{conviction}} {{on the grounds}} that it was <b>unfair</b> due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> level of publicity the case had received. His application was rejected by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales on 5 February 1998 after the three sitting judges ruled there were insufficient grounds to justify an appeal.|$|R
25|$|The umpires are {{required}} {{to make sure that}} bowlers' and batsmen's footholes are cleaned out and dried whenever necessary to facilitate play. In matches of more than one day's duration, if necessary, the footholes made by the bowler in his delivery stride may be returfed or covered with quick-setting fillings to make them safe and secure. Players may also secure their footholes using sawdust provided that the pitch is not damaged or they do not do so {{in a way that is}} <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other team.|$|E
25|$|When Willingham {{was fired}} {{all of his}} {{assistant}} coaches left, leaving Weis to rebuild a coaching staff. He sought to find experienced coaches that {{would be able to}} make the team competitive. When the new assistants were announced in January they were billed as having 25 seasons of collegiate head coaching, 50 seasons as coordinators, 12 seasons as NFL assistant coaches, and 42 bowl victories. Before the season, however, assistant offensive head and quarterbacks coach David Cutcliffe after undergoing heart surgery and being on medical leave, decided to resign, saying he felt his absence <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> players and coaches. In early June, Peter Vaas was named as Cutcliffe's replacement. Vaas was a former six-year NFL Europa head coach, an eight-year collegiate head coach, and had 17 years of assistant coaching experience, including two years at Notre Dame under Lou Holtz.|$|E

50|$|As {{the example}} illustrates, a {{consensus}} division {{is not necessarily}} fair. For example, if the 20% piece is given <b>to</b> Alice and <b>the</b> 50% is given to George, this is obviously <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> Alice. In <b>the</b> theory of cake, consensus divisions are often used as subroutines for creating fair divisions.|$|R

500|$|Fonville {{competed in}} the Olympic trials in Evanston, Illinois in mid-July 1948, {{but he was not}} able to meet his own {{standards}} as a result of the injury. He finished fourth and, despite having broken the world record just three months earlier, did not qualify for the U.S. Olympic team. There were some who suggested that Fonville should be named to the Olympic team despite his fourth-place finish at the trials; others argued it would be <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> third-place finisher to take away his spot on the team. And [...] "there was also a suspicion that Fonville's ailing back hadn't healed and that his performance at Evanston represented the best he can do at this time." ...|$|E
500|$|The lead-up to Underbelly {{involved}} a heavy marketing campaign which covered radio, print, billboards {{and an increased}} online presence, {{including the use of}} social networking tools. At a reported cost of $500,000, both this marketing investment and potentially millions of dollars in advertising revenue were claimed to be put at risk by the Victorian Supreme Court's injunction, as the series was expected to attract 800,000 to 1million viewers in Victoria alone. The injunction was put in place to ensure that upcoming criminal trials were not <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> accused, because the series contained fictionalised re-enactments of several disputed events. Underbelly began screening on 13 February 2008 on the Nine Network in all states and territories except Victoria. An edited version of the series premiered in Victoria on 14 September 2008 after the injunction was partially lifted, although only the first five episodes were shown. In 2011, the injunction was partially lifted and the series was screened as [...] "Underbelly: Uncut". This rebroadcast included scenes from the original DVD release, as well as several significant changes that were made to keep the show current, including a newly recorded final voiceover and the crediting of several characters that were previously uncredited (allowable due to the ending of related trials). Some previously named characters in the final episode however are now unable to be named, resulting in a continued banning of the sale of the video release in Victoria.|$|E

However, Thompson supports {{a path to}} citizenship [...] "You’re going to have to, in some way, work out a deal where they can have some aspirations of citizenship, but not make it so easy that it’s <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> people waiting in line and abiding by the law." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{rule for}} calculating the target {{score for the}} team batting second in rain-affected matches was also changed. The {{previous}} rule (the Average Run Rate method) simply multiplied the run rate of the team batting first {{by the number of}} overs available <b>to</b> <b>the</b> team batting second, but this rule had been deemed <b>to</b> give an <b>unfair</b> advantage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> team batting second.|$|R
50|$|IUU harvests may {{be brought}} to market {{at a lower price}} as <b>unfair</b> {{competition}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same products from the regulated supply or as a mislabeled competing product.

30|$|Regardless of bad mouthing or ballot stuffing, {{we follow}} six types of {{fraudulent}} raters’ behavior models summarized in Irissappane et al. (2012). The first three are “constant attack,” “camouflage attack,” and “whitewashing attack.” A “constant attack” {{indicates that a}} fraudulent rater consistently provides unfairly high (low) ratings <b>to</b> <b>the</b> target entity in a ballot stuffing (bad mouthing) scheme. A “camouflage attack” is performed by a strategical fraudulent rater, who will inject fair ratings to non-target entities to camouflage himself/herself, in addition <b>to</b> injecting <b>unfair</b> ratings <b>to</b> <b>the</b> target entities. This type of attack brings more challenges <b>to</b> <b>the</b> reliability of reputation systems, as {{it is more difficult}} to differentiate fraudulent raters from honest ones because their ratings are more similar to each other. In a “whitewashing attack,” a rater will inject <b>unfair</b> ratings <b>to</b> <b>the</b> target entity for a period. Subsequently, he/she whitewashes himself/herself by creating a new account and thereupon behaving as an honest rater.|$|R
2500|$|Thompson {{said that}} U.S. borders should be secured before {{considering}} comprehensive immigration reform, {{but he also}} supported a path to citizenship for illegal aliens saying, “You’re going to have to, in some way, work out a deal where they can have some aspirations of citizenship, but not make it so easy that it’s <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> people waiting in line and abiding by the law.” Thompson supported the U.S. 2003 invasion of Iraq ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{a student}} and {{educator}} level. There is criticism from students themselves that tests, while standardized, are <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> individual student. Some students are [...] "bad test takers", meaning they get nervous and unfocused on tests. Therefore, while the test is standard and should provide fair results, the test takers are at a disadvantage, but {{have no way to}} prove their knowledge otherwise, as there is no other testing alternative that allows students to prove their knowledge and problem-solving skills.|$|E
2500|$|A somber {{note was}} struck in February 2004 when ESPN named the Blackhawks the worst {{franchise}} in professional sports. Indeed, the Blackhawks were viewed with much indifference by Chicagoans {{for much of}} the 1990s and early 2000s due to anger over several policies instituted by then-owner Bill Wirtz, who was derisively known as [...] "Dollar Bill". For example, Wirtz did not allow home games to be televised in the Chicago area, claiming it was <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> team's season ticket holders. He also raised ticket prices to an average of $50, among the most expensive in the NHL. The Chicago Wolves, an American Hockey League team based in Rosemont, Illinois, mocked the Blackhawks' struggle by creating a marketing slogan, [...] "We Play Hockey The Old-Fashioned Way: We Actually Win." ...|$|E

50|$|Despite the letter, Live Nation stated {{they will}} {{continue}} to book concerts in the auditorium and dome.

2500|$|Judges also place a large {{weight on}} the amount of corroborating {{evidence}} that can be submitted to support each piece. [...] Typically, a judge will not admit a piece of evidence unless it can be supported by expert testimony, witnesses or other physical evidence. [...] One piece of evidence in a crime is somewhat meaningless. [...] Many pieces must fit together and support the prosecution’s (or the defense’s) theory. [...] Similarly, a judge will not grant admissibility to evidence that proves guilt or innocence without a doubt. [...] This rule is eagerly applied to matters of scientific evidence because juries tend to place too much emphasis on certain evidence, particularly DNA evidence, which is believed to be fool-proof. [...] It is preferred that the circumstances are reconstructed and confirmed in small pieces. [...] The admission of these pieces is viewed as <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other counsel and is denied. The goal of the court is to leave a decision to be made by the jury after all of the evidence has been presented. [...] Large, sweeping evidentiary discoveries take the subjectivity of the evidence out, especially in regards to scientific discoveries.|$|E
2500|$|Further {{controversy}} arose when, in 1912, Lasker's {{terms for}} a proposed match with Akiba Rubinstein included a clause that, if Lasker should resign the title after a date {{had been set}} for the match, Rubinstein should become world champion (American Chess Bulletin, October 1913). When he resumed negotiations with Capablanca after World War I, Lasker insisted on a similar clause that if Lasker should resign the title after a date had been set for the match, Capablanca should become world champion. On 27 June 1920 Lasker abdicated in favor of Capablanca because of public criticisms of the terms for the match, naming Capablanca as his successor (American Chess Bulletin, July August 1920). Some commentators questioned Lasker's right to name his successor (British Chess Magazine, August 1920; Rochester Democrat and Chronicle); Amos Burn raised the same objection but welcomed Lasker's resignation of the title (The Field, 3 July 1920). Capablanca argued that, if the champion abdicated, the title {{must go to the}} challenger as any other arrangement would be <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> challenger (British Chess Magazine, October 1922). Nonetheless Lasker agreed to play a match against Capablanca in 1921, announcing that, if he won, he would resign the title so that younger masters could compete for it ("Dr Lasker and the Championship" [...] in American Chess Bulletin, September–October 1920). Capablanca won their 1921 match easily.|$|E
