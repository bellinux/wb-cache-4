500|$|Matty Johns and {{the other}} players were {{investigated}} by police and cleared of any criminal wrongdoing. In May 2009, Johns appeared on the Nine Network's [...] A Current Affair program to explain {{his role in the}} event. He admitted having sex with the young woman, but claimed that it was consensual. He was later described as appearing during this interview like a [...] "broken-down wreck". Johns later said that he [...] "disconnected" [...] for a month after his suspension. He stated that his wife and family experienced [...] "great pain" [...] {{in the midst of the}} publicity. He said, [...] "It took <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time to get over it. It pains me they have to go through it again." [...] There was speculation that his media career was over.|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producer}} J. H. Wyman later indicated how [...] "White Tulip" [...] {{helped with}} {{the evolution of the}} show in an interview: [...] "It's very important to constantly try to attract more viewers and to try and not make the show alienating... Our solution {{came in the form of}} ‘White Tulip' and episodes like that, because we realized what we need to do to satiate both our hardcore fans and our financial responsibility is to create a term that we coined a 'mythalone.' It sounds really simple when you say it now, like, ‘Yes, sure, you have a great standalone case, plus you thread in some great mythology.' But I've got to tell you it took <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time to get there and realize it. Now we have that our template for telling stories that we think satisfies both parties". He and Pinkner later listed [...] "White Tulip" [...] as one of their favorite episodes.|$|E
500|$|... "We {{did a lot}} of work on {{character}} and set-up, and then kept changing the set up while we were doing the animation," [...] Hui noted. [...] "In Antz, we had a facial system that gave us all the facial muscles under the skin. In Shrek, we applied that to whole body. So, if you pay attention to Shrek when he talks, you see that when he opens his jaw, he forms a double chin, because we have the fat and the muscles underneath. That kind of detail took <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time to get right." [...] One of the most difficult parts of creating the film was making Donkey's fur flow smoothly so that it didn't look like that of a Chia Pet. This fell {{into the hands of the}} surfacing animators who used flow controls within a complex shader to provide the fur with many attributes (ability to change directions, lie flat, swirl, etc.). It was then the job of the visual effects group, led by Ken Bielenberg, to make the fur react to environment conditions. Once the technology was mastered, it was able to be applied to many aspects of the Shrek movie including grass, moss, beards, eyebrows, and even threads on Shrek's tunic. Making human hair realistic was different from Donkey's fur, requiring a separate rendering system and a lot of attention from the lighting and visual effects teams.|$|E

2500|$|The 2010 BBC Proms {{premiere of}} Latent Manifest {{performed}} by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Andrew Litton, was widely reviewed in London: [...] personal canvas, taking <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way from a literal reworking into the realms of evanescent fantasy, with delicately evocative results (The Guardian, London), ...a beguiling response to response itself – a mirage of intimations and allusions to [...] own experience of hearing Bach’s third solo Violin Sonata (The Times, London), a gracefully-controlled meditation on a single Bach phrase (The Independent, London).|$|E
2500|$|Debbie Harry said [...] "Who doesn't love Bowie? A visionary artist, musician, actor, a {{completely}} renaissance {{man who has}} given <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> list of songs like 'Heroes,' 'Rebel Rebel,' 'Young Americans,' 'Diamond Dogs,' 'The Jean Genie,' and some memorable film performances like The Man Who Fell to Earth, Basquiat, Labyrinth, The Hunger. [...] I can't say enough things about David Bowie to show how much I love him." [...] Paul McCartney, meanwhile, shared {{a picture of him}} and Bowie together on Instagram and commented that [...] "David was a great star and I treasure the moments we had together. His music played a very strong part in British musical history and I'm proud to think of the huge influence he has had on people all around the world".|$|E
2500|$|The press duly {{built the}} series up as a must-see, but {{the players were}} far more reticent {{than they had been}} during the {{adjacent}} encounter three years before. [...] Early in December, however, Australian captain Ricky Ponting drew considerable criticism for his comments about the ICC's wines and spirits. [...] "It has taken <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time and a lot of great wins in different conditions around the world to get us to that number-one spot", Ponting declared, speaking to the Associated Press. [...] "If South Africa beat us three-nil I don't know if that gives them enough points to get over us. [...] But if they won the series one-nil or two-one, I don't think that would mean that they deserve to take over that mantle. [...] It's a bit the same with India last series. [...] Just because they beat us, the number-one team, doesn't necessarily mean they go from the number four or number five in the world to number one in the world, because it's something that's accrued {{over a long period of}} time." [...] The remark was seen as fatalist and trivialising, suggesting that the rubber hardly mattered and, in the eyes of many, that Ponting's hopes of securing a series victory were low.|$|E
