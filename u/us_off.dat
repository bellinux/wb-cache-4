5|$|In 1989, Gaddafi was overjoyed by the {{foundation}} of the Arab Maghreb Union, uniting Libya in an economic pact with Mauritania, Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria, viewing it as beginnings of a new Pan-Arab union. Meanwhile, Libya stepped up its support for anti-Western militants such as the Provisional IRA, and in 1988, Pan Am Flight 103 was blown up over Lockerbie in Scotland, killing 243 passengers and 16 crew members, plus 11 people on the ground. British police investigations identified two Libyans – Abdelbaset al-Megrahi and Lamin Khalifah Fhimah – as the chief suspects, and in November 1991 issued a declaration demanding that Libya hand them over. When Gaddafi refused, citing the Montreal Convention, the United Nations (UN) imposed Resolution 748 in March 1992, initiating economic sanctions against Libya which had deep repercussions for the country's economy. The country suffered an estimated $900 million financial loss as a result. Further problems arose with the West when in January 1989, two Libyan warplanes were shot down by the <b>U.S.</b> <b>off</b> the Libyan coast. Many African states opposed the UN sanctions, with Mandela criticizing them on a visit to Gaddafi in October 1997, when he praised Libya for its work in fighting apartheid and awarded Gaddafi the Order of Good Hope. They would only be suspended in 1998 when Libya agreed to allow the extradition of the suspects to the Scottish Court in the Netherlands, in a process overseen by Mandela.|$|E

The Embargo Act of 1807, which virtually sealed the <b>U.S.</b> <b>off</b> from the outside world, has been cited as the most dramatic example of the failure of Jefferson's [...] "inflated assessment" [...] of American power—a failure the president never fully grasped, and which helped lead the nation into the War of 1812.|$|E

[...] On October 11, Mark Martin had a narrow victory over Kulwicki at the Mello Yello 500 at Charlotte. For the second race in a row, points leader Bill Elliott had problems, which left sixdrivers within reach of the title with threeraces left to go. Elliott had problems again at the second-to-last race, and his cracked cylinder head allowed race winner Davey Allison to take the points lead, with fourthplace finisher Kulwicki second in season points and Elliott third.|$|E

[...] The quote caused a storm of controversy, with Noel having to write a letter of apology; he later confessed that [...] "my whole world came crashing down in on me then". However, in an interview with The Guardian in 2005, Blur's guitarist Graham Coxon explained that he bore no malice towards Oasis. [...] "At least they were outright about it.

500|$|For Bennion, it was [...] "a {{credit to}} the two creators that they can pack in such a depth of emotion into 29 minutes". Similarly, Wilson praised the writers for {{achieving}} [...] "genuine poignancy" [...] in half an hour, and critics in the Metro said that the episode [...] "packs more drama and suspense into 30 minutes than many a five-part series". Mulkern said the episode was a [...] "superb piece of drama, imbued with an increasing sense of dread". The story's ending was praised, with Dessau saying that [...] "One of the skills of actor/writers Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton {{is the way they}} plant seeds and gradually leak out details. They do it so expertly here that one really doesn't see what is coming." [...] McDowall expressed a similar thought, saying that the [...] "writers so cleverly threw <b>us</b> <b>off</b> the scent, making the eventual realisation so agonising". Wilson called the ending [...] "devastating and unforeseen".|$|E
500|$|Smetana's eight operas {{created the}} bedrock of the Czech opera repertory, but of these only The Bartered Bride is {{performed}} regularly outside the composer's homeland. After reaching Vienna in 1892, and London in 1895, it rapidly {{became part of the}} repertory of every major opera company worldwide. Newmarch argues that The Bartered Bride, while not a [...] "gem of the first order", is nevertheless [...] "a perfectly cut and polished stone of its kind." [...] Its trademark overture, which Newmarch says [...] "lifts <b>us</b> <b>off</b> our feet with its madcap vivacity", was composed in a piano version before Smetana received the draft libretto. Clapham believes that this has few precedents in the entire history of opera. Smetana himself was later inclined to disparage his achievement: [...] "The Bartered Bride was merely child's play, written straight off the reel". In the view of German critic William Ritter, Smetana's creative powers reached their zenith with his third opera, Dalibor.|$|E
500|$|Michael Deacon of The Daily Telegraph reacted {{positively}} {{towards the}} series, stating [...] "episode one was enjoyably sinister. It was also, once or twice, quite amusing, in (of course) a blokey way." [...] Deacon liked {{the beginning of}} the pilot where the main characters record a video message, stating [...] "this is what Mad Dogs did well – like any competent suspense thriller, it made you ask questions throughout. The episode bubbled with foreboding, right up to the cliffhanger." [...] Deacon also noted at the cliffhanger that [...] "the most disturbing sight wasn't the shower of blood but the gunman's rubber mask, which was of a grinning Tony Blair." [...] John Crace of The Guardian was more mixed, starting [...] "after unsuccessfully fobbing <b>us</b> <b>off</b> with endless series of Ross Kemp looking macho, Sky is now throwing serious money at getting viewers to watch something other than sport." [...] Crace was critical of the set up of the episode, stating [...] "I'm all for allowing a drama time to breathe but we didn't really need a whole hour just to establish that Alvo was a bit dodgy and that the four others had complications in their lives. Rather than building menace, the snail-like pace dissipated it," [...] However, he reacted positively towards the end, as [...] "things did eventually look up," [...] adding [...] "there's hope for Mad Dogs yet." ...|$|E

500|$|Mickiewicz's {{importance}} {{extends beyond}} literature {{to the broader}} spheres of culture and politics; Wyka writes {{that he was a}} [...] "singer and epic poet of the Polish people, and a pilgrim for the freedom of nations." [...] Scholars have used the expression [...] "cult of Mickiewicz" [...] to describe the reverence in which he is held as a [...] "national prophet." [...] On hearing of Mickiewicz's death, his fellow bard Krasiński wrote: [...] "For men of my generation, he was milk and honey, gall and life's blood: we all descend from him. He carried <b>us</b> <b>off</b> on the surging billow of his inspiration and cast us into the world." [...] Edward Henry Lewinski Corwin described Mickiewicz's works as Promethean, as [...] "reaching more Polish hearts" [...] than the other Polish Bards, and affirmed Danish critic Georg Brandes' assessment of Mickiewicz's works as [...] "healthier" [...] than those of Byron, Shakespeare, Homer, and Goethe. Koropeckyi writes that Mickiewicz has [...] "informed the foundations of [...] parties and ideologies" [...] in Poland from the 19th century to this day, [...] "down to the rappers in Poland's post-socialist blocks, who can somehow still declare that 'if Mickiewicz was alive today, he'd be a good rapper.'" [...] While Mickiewicz's popularity has endured two centuries in Poland, he is less well known abroad though, particularly in the 19th century, he won substantial international fame among [...] "people that dared resist the brutal might of reactionary empires." ...|$|E
500|$|Natalie Finn from E! Online was {{disappointed}} with the track, feeling that although the releases from Born This Way were not that [...] "catchy", {{all of them were}} about the same subject of [...] "the importance of being ourselves. Oh well, maybe we're just waiting for the next 'Bad Romance' to sweep <b>us</b> <b>off</b> our feet. Or the next 'Speechless' to make us cry. Or even the next 'Just Dance' to really make us want to dance." [...] Jason Lipshultz from Billboard felt that the track was another anthem for individualism, with Gaga's hair used as a metaphor for her wild personality. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine gave a mixed review stating that the song is a [...] "derivative but perfectly serviceable club track about highlights that's turned into a dumping ground for every bad idea Gaga's had in the last 12 months: schmaltzy piano-woman melodies, overwrought choruses, inexplicable sax solos." [...] Rick Fulton, while writing in the Daily Record, called [...] "Hair" [...] a [...] "great tune" [...] and an [...] "Europop high-energy epic", while giving it four out of five points. Ian Hope from [...] BBC Online described [...] "Hair" [...] as an [...] "empowering freeway rocker about self expression." [...] The Independent writer Andy Gill compared the song to those by guitarist David Crosby, and described it as a statement of rebellious individuality. According to Los Angeles Times Randall Roberts, Gaga [...] "celebrates her follicles" [...] in the song.|$|E
500|$|Real estate magnate Donald Trump, head of The Trump Organization since 1971, first {{dabbled in}} presidential {{politics}} in the early summer of 1987. [...] Republican political organizer Mike Dunbar, unimpressed with the candidates for the 1988 Republican presidential nomination, founded the [...] "Draft Trump for President" [...] organization. [...] Believing Trump had {{the makings of a}} president, Dunbar pitched Trump the idea of speaking at an event for Republican candidates in the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire. [...] According to Dunbar in a later interview, Trump was receptive to this idea. [...] Then a registered Democrat, Trump officially changed his registration to Republican in July 1987. [...] Speculation that he would actually run for president intensified two months later, when he purchased $94,801 worth of full-page advertisements in The New York Times, Boston Globe, and The Washington Post with the heading [...] "There’s nothing wrong with America’s Foreign Defense Policy that a little backbone can’t cure." [...] The advertisements reflected Trump's concerns that Japan, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait were taking advantage of American money and protection without providing any benefit to the United States. [...] The next month, as Dunbar had proposed, Trump appeared at a Rotary Club luncheon in New Hampshire. [...] There, he delivered what The New York Times described as an [...] "impassioned speech," [...] in which he expressed concern about the United States being [...] "pushed around" [...] by its allies and proposed that [...] "these countries that are ripping <b>us</b> <b>off</b> pay off the $200 billion deficit." [...] In the audience, college students held placards reading [...] "Trump for President." [...] Nevertheless, Trump proclaimed, [...] "I'm not here because I'm running for President. I'm here because I'm tired of our country being kicked around and I want to get my ideas across." [...] Later, Trump appeared on the Phil Donahue Show. [...] After the appearance, he received a letter from former President Richard Nixon in which Nixon explained that his wife Pat, [...] "an expert on politics," [...] had seen Trump on the show and [...] "predicts that whenever you decide to run for office you will be a winner!" [...] In November 1987, Trump released , which became a New York Times bestseller.|$|E
