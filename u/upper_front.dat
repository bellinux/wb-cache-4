Unlike the 2012 model, the 2013 model is manufactured by Bell.|$|E

Between the <b>upper</b> <b>front</b> and rear posts of the frame were fitted two streamlined fuel tanks (clearly visible in the image above), one on each side of and above the pilot’s seat, with a combined capacity of six gallons (22.7 L.).|$|E
25|$|The describers {{established}} six distinguishing traits. At {{their very}} midline, the praemaxillae {{meet in a}} small sharp point, set within a larger notch in the snout tip as a whole. The front lower side edge of the praemaxilla protrudes to below. At least seventeen cervical vertebrae are present. The neural spines of the middle cervical vertebrae have a notch at their lower front edge with immediately above it a process directed to the front. The vertebrae of the middle neck, rear neck and front back possess neural spines that have a transversely expanded upper end. On the neck two rows of triangular bony plates are present that have a lightly convex outer side and a notch at the <b>upper</b> <b>front</b> edge creating a hook.|$|E

500|$|Terry-Thomas (born Thomas Terry Hoar Stevens; 10 July 19118 January 1990) was an English comedian and {{character}} actor who became known to a worldwide audience through his many films during the 1950s and 1960s. He often portrayed disreputable {{members of the}} upper classes, especially , toffs and , using his distinctive voice; his costume and props tended to include a monocle, waistcoat and cigarette holder. His striking dress sense was set off by a [...] gap between his two <b>upper</b> <b>front</b> teeth.|$|E
500|$|Kelly drank a lot; saxophonist Jimmy Heath {{described}} him as [...] "an alcoholic" [...] who [...] "could control his drinking" [...] and not let his playing be affected by it. Kelly was known [...] "for being a very warm, generous human being". Bassist Bill Crow reported that Kelly was [...] "full of fun": [...] "He was often the center of backstage laughing sessions as we told stories on each other. Wynton had a removable <b>upper</b> <b>front</b> denture. While on stage, if he saw some of us standing in the wings listening, he would turn around so the audience couldn't see, give us a stern look, and drop his upper plate forward onto his lower lip, creating a grotesquely comical effect. Sometimes he heightened it by sticking his tongue out at us over his upper teeth." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1942 he {{was named}} by Collier's Weekly as its [...] "Lineman of the Year" [...] and by Grantland Rice as [...] "Player of the Year." [...] Olds was also {{selected}} as an All-American as the cadets compiled a 6-3 record, beating Lafayette College, Cornell, Columbia, Harvard, VMI, and Princeton, and falling to Notre Dame, Penn, and Navy. In the Army–Navy Game of 1942, which was played at Annapolis instead of Philadelphia, Olds had both <b>upper</b> <b>front</b> teeth knocked out when he received a forearm blow [...] to the mouth while making a tackle. Olds returned to the game and reportedly was cheered by the Navy Third and Fourth Classes, which were assigned as the Army cheering section when wartime travel restrictions prevented the Corps of Cadets from attending. In 1985 Olds was enshrined in the College Football Hall of Fame.|$|E

500|$|Characteristic {{features}} of the tyrannosauroid pelvis include a [...] notch at the <b>upper</b> <b>front</b> end of the ilium, a sharply defined vertical ridge on the outside surface of the ilium, extending upwards from the acetabulum (hip socket), and a huge [...] "boot" [...] {{on the end of}} the pubis, more than half as long as the shaft of the pubis itself. These features are found in all known tyrannosauroids, including basal members Guanlong and Dilong. The pubis is not known in Aviatyrannis or Stokesosaurus but both show typical tyrannosauroid characters in the ilium. The hindlimbs of all tyrannosauroids, like most theropods, had four toes, although the first toe (the hallux) did not contact the ground. Tyrannosauroid hindlimbs are longer relative to body size than almost any other theropods, and show proportions characteristic of fast-running animals, including elongated tibiae and metatarsals. These proportions persist even in the largest adult Tyrannosaurus, despite its probable inability to run. The third metatarsal of tyrannosaurids was pinched at the top between the second and fourth, forming a structure known as the arctometatarsus. The arctometatarsus was also present in Appalachiosaurus but it is unclear whether it was found in Eotyrannus or Dryptosaurus. This structure was shared by derived ornithomimids, troodontids and caenagnathids, but was not present in basal tyrannosauroids like Dilong, indicating convergent evolution.|$|E

2500|$|When {{measuring}} the vertical range of motion, the measurement must be adjusted for the overbite.

The car had a front splitter lip to direct air to the <b>upper</b> <b>front</b> aperture, and a carbon fibre rear wing with Gurney flap. There were carbon fibre inserts on the rear wing fins with a GT-R badge on the inserts. The [...] "GT-R Skyline" [...] logo under the checkered flag {{was placed on the}} C-pillars.|$|E

2500|$|The armor of the PT-76 {{consists}} of homogeneous, cold-rolled, welded steel. Its turret has 20mm at 35° at the front, 16mm at 35° at the sides, 11mm at 33° {{at the rear}} and 8mm at 0° {{on top of the}} turret. The hull is made up of: 10mm at 80° at the <b>upper</b> <b>front,</b> 13mm at 80° at the lower front, 14mm at 0° at the sides, 7mm at 0° in the rear and 5mm at 0° underneath. This gives it protection against 7.62mm small arms fire and small artillery shell fragments. It does not protect it against 12.7mm or [...]50-caliber heavy machine gun fire or larger shell fragments.|$|E
2500|$|Another partial splint is the {{nociceptive}} trigeminal inhibition tension {{suppression system}} (NTI-TSS) dental guard. This splint snaps onto the <b>upper</b> <b>front</b> teeth only. It is theorized to prevent tissue damages primarily {{by reducing the}} bite force from attempts to close the jaw normally into a forward twisting of the lower front teeth. The intent is for the brain to interpret the nerve sensations as undesirable, automatically and subconsciously reducing clenching force. However, there may be potential for the NTI-TSS device {{to act as a}} Dahl appliance, holding the posterior teeth out of occlusion and leading to their over-eruption, deranging the occlusion (i.e. [...] it may cause the teeth to move position). Hence, ongoing follow-ups are recommended.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{his return}} to Formula One, he sported a black helmet with a white {{diagonal}} line crossing from each side until the angles of the visor and a thicker red diagonal line beneath the white line and a red number 9 {{in a corner of}} the white line (to allude to his car number), a white circle in the top with black edged designs (similar to horns) on the <b>upper</b> <b>front.</b> The design on the top became black and in the back of the helmet there was the inscription [...] "Iceman" [...] written in red letters. From the Australian Grand Prix, there were more details added on top of the helmet. For the Monaco Grand Prix, he wore a replica of the 1976 James Hunt helmet. The manufacturer of his helmet for the 2012 season was Arai.|$|E
