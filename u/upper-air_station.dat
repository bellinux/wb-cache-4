40|$|An {{objective}} meteorological analysis {{technique is}} presented whereby both {{horizontal and vertical}} upper air analyses are performed. The process used to interpolate grid-point values from the <b>upper-air</b> <b>station</b> data {{is the same as}} for grid points on both an isobaric surface and a vertical cross-sectional plane. The nearby data surrounding each grid point are used in the interpolation by means of an anisotropic weighting scheme, which is described. The interpolation for a grid-point potential temperature is performed isobarically; whereas wind, mixing-ratio, and pressure height values are interpolated from data that lie on the isentropic surface that passes through the grid point. Two versions (A and B) of the technique are evaluated by qualitatively comparing computer analyses with subjective handdrawn analyses. The objective products of version A generally have fair correspondence with the subjective analyses and with the station data, and depicted the structure of the upper fronts, tropopauses, and jet streams fairly well. The version B objective products correspond more closely to the subjective analyses, and show the same strong gradients across the upper front with only minor smoothing...|$|E
40|$|It is {{described}} an easy-to-use and efficient procedure of the operational testing of alignment and orientation and verifying overall angular tracking {{performance of the}} Russian AVK upper-air radars.

40|$|M. Sc. (Geography) In {{this study}} the spatial and {{temporal}} variation of radio-refractivity over southern Africa is investigated. Climatological data from 8 <b>upper-air</b> <b>stations</b> and 49 surface stations were used and transformed. into values of refractivity to establish a data base of radio refractivity information. The spatial analysis yielded maps of surface refractivity (Ns) and height corrected surface refractivity (No) for southern Africa. In order to calculate the height correction factors, a radio-climatological classification of southern Africa was drawn: up. These maps are a refinement of the existing maps published by the CSIR. The temporal analysis consisted of graphs of mean monthly and yearly values of various refractivity- (Ns, Delta N, K-factor) and climatological (temperature, vapour pressure) factors for the eight <b>upper-air</b> <b>stations.</b> Some preliminary information about ducting was also obtained from this analysis. A spatial-temporal analysis of limited extent was then performed for one station to obtain {{an indication of the}} factors leading to the formation of radio ducts, as well as the actual variation of refractivity with height.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of {{anthropogenic climate change}} has reached the attention of Government officials and researchers. However, one cannot study climate change without climate data. The CARDS project will produce high-quality upper-air data for the research community and for policy-makers. The authors intend to produce a dataset which is: easy to use, as complete as possible, as free of random errors as possible. They will also attempt to identify biases and remove them whenever possible. In this report, they relate progress toward their goal. They created a robust new format for archiving upper-air data, and designed a relational database structure to hold them. The authors have converted 13 datasets to the new format and have archived over 10, 000, 000 individual soundings from 10 separate data sources.

40|$|The {{skill and}} eciency of a {{numerical}} model mostly {{varies with the}} quality of initial values, accu-racy on parameterization of physical processes and horizontal and vertical resolution of the model. Commonly used low-resolution reanalyses are hardly able to capture the prominent features asso-ciated with organized convective processes in a monsoon depression. The objective is to prepare improved high-resolution analysis by the use of MM 5 modelling system developed by the Pennsyl-vania State University/National Center for Atmospheric Research (PSU/NCAR). It requires the objective comparison of high and low-resolution analysis datasets in assessing the specic convective features of a monsoon depression. For this purpose, reanalysis datasets of NCAR/NCEP (National Center for Atmospheric Research/National Centers for Environmental Prediction) at a horizon-tal resolution of 2 : 5 (latitude/longitude) have been used as rst guess in the objective analysis scheme. The additional asynoptic datasets obtained during BOBMEX- 99 are utilized within the assimilation process.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Measurements from Whitehorse upper-air {{and nearby}} mountaintop {{stations}} were analyzed {{with a focus}} on wind energy development in the region. Fifty years of measurements indicate the region has become warmer and windier. Measurements at the <b>upper-air</b> <b>station</b> have shown increases of 2. 7 ˚C for surface temperature and 1 m s- 1 for mid-valley winds over the past 50 years (1956 – 2005). The winters have warmed more dramatically than the summers. Winter temperature inversions have become shallower, and a mid-valley winter jet has become a predominant feature. Wind data for 2001 – 05 indicate that a minimum annual mean wind speed of 6 m s- 1 begins at about 150 m above the Whitehorse valley floor, or 850 m above sea level. At this elevation and higher, wind speeds reach a maximum in December and a minimum in July. The predominant wind direction above the mountaintops was from the southwest, while stations within the Whitehorse Valley recorded winds from the south-southeast. Stations that were more exposed to the southwest reported more predominant winds from this direction. An analysis of the relationship between geostrophic and valley winds concluded that, relative to winds aloft, valley winds were as strong in parallel valleys as they were in perpendicular valleys. The pressure gradients associated with the winds aloft were the dominant forcing mechanism for winds in a perpendicular valley. Geostrophic winds that were parallel to the valley forced the valley winds along the same direction through a downward momentum transport. Wintertime inversions suppress the downward momentum transport, but pressure-driven winds are only indirectly modulated by stratification (because of turbulent friction, which is likely to be suppressed by stable stratification) and so are less sensitive to that factor. Further investigation of wind energy potential i...|$|E

40|$|Investigation of the {{atmospheric}} dispersion {{as part of}} the process of selection of sites to accommodate nuclear and thermal power plants is performed to identify concentration fields of emissions and to assess the anthropogenic impact produced on the landscape components and human beings. Scattering properties of {{the atmospheric}} boundary layer are mainly determined by the turbulence intensity and the wind field. In its turn, the turbulence intensity is associated with the thermal stratification of the boundary layer. Therefore, research of the atmospheric dispersion is reduced to the study of temperature and wind patterns of the boundary layer. Statistical processing and analysis of the upper-air data involves the input of the data collected by upper-air stations. Until recently, the upper-air data covering the standard period between 1961 and 1970 were applied for these purposes, although these data cannot assure sufficient reliability of assessments in terms of the properties of the atmospheric dispersion. However, recent scientific and technological developments make it possible to substantially increase the data coverage by adding the upper-air data collected within the period between 1964 and 2010. The article has a brief overview of BL_PROGS, a specialized software package designated for the processing of the above data. The software package analyzes the principal properties of the atmospheric dispersion. The use of the proposed software package requires preliminary development of a database that has the information collected by an <b>upper-air</b> <b>station.</b> The software package is noteworthy for the absence of any substantial limitations imposed onto the amount of the input data that may go up in proportion to the amount of the upper-air data collected by upper-air stations.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} {{the evolution of}} a mesoscale convective system (MCS) developed over the Alboran Sea on 7 February 2005, using surface, <b>upper-air</b> <b>stations,</b> radar and satellite observations, and also data from an operational numerical model. The system developed during the night as a small convective storm line in an environment with slight convective instability, low precipitable water and strong low-level vertical wind shear near coast. The linear MCS moved northwards reaching the Spanish coast. Then it remained trapped along the coast for more than twelve hours, following the coast more than five hundred kilometres. The MCS here described had a fundamental orographic character due to: (1) the generation of a low-level storm inflow parallel to the coast, formed by blocking of the onshore flow by coastal mountains and (2) the orientation of both the mesoscale ascent from the sea towards the coastal mountains and the midlevel rear inflow from the coastal mountains to the sea.

Even for the period between 1948 (the starting year of the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis) and the International Geophysical Year in 1957 (the starting year of the ERA- 40 reanalysis), when the global upper-air coverage reached more or less its current status, many observations have not been digitised until now. The Comprehensive Historical Upper-Air Network (CHUAN) already compiled a large collection of pre- 1957 upper-air data. In the framework of the European project ERA-CLIM, significant amounts of additional upper-air data have been catalogued (> 1. 3 mio station days), imaged (> 200, 000 images) and digitised (> 700, 000 station days) in order to prepare a new input dataset for upcoming reanalyses.

The data have been compiled {{from a number of}} sources and cover the Pacific–North American sector relatively well over this time period. Temperature and geopotential height profiles from aircraft, kite, and radiosonde ascents back to 1922 have been digitized and validated. Wind speed and direction from pilot balloon data back to the early 1920 s, provided by NCAR, have also been used. A statistical regression approach is used for the reconstruction and calibrated in the post- 1948 period using NCEP–NCAR reanalysis data. Split-sample validation experiments were performed within the NCEP–NCAR period, and sensitivity experiments with different subsets of predictors were performed. Similar reconstructions and validation experiments were carried out using a 540 -yr control run from the Community Climate System Model, version 3 (CCSM 3). The reconstructed index series together with validation statistics for both the historical and model data are presented. Excellent reconstruction skill is found for the winter months, while the reconstructions are somewhat worse in summer. Compared with a reconstruction based only on surface data, the addition of the newly digitized <b>upper-air</b> <b>stations</b> improves the reconstruction skill in all seasons. The historical reconstruction is presented with respect to its imprint on hemispheric fields of surface air temperature, sea level pressure, and precipitation with a special focus on extreme cases.

40|$|The GCOS {{recommends}} that <b>upper-air</b> <b>stations</b> use a particular model radiosonde {{for as long}} as is feasible and if change is necessary that an overlapping flight series of old and new radiosondes be conducted at representative sites. The overlapping flights enable the formulation of bias transfer functions. These functions are then applied to the new data sets. This is to ensure a consistent historical data series suitable for long-term climate trends analysis by the climate community. There are 163 GUAN radiosonde sites from over 67 countries using radiosondes from six providers. Forty percent of these GUAN sites are launching one or less radiosondes per day either because of operational forecasting requirements or because of the costs of radiosonde flights. Next generation radiosondes and technical adjustments to existing radiosondes used in the GUAN network are taking place, and {{a significant portion of the}} GUAN network is obsolete and no longer supportable. New systems are being introduced and the existing systems are continually introducing technology improvements. To satisfy the GCOS literal recommendation for overlapping radiosonde flight series requires a major financial commitment by GCOS quality radiosonde flights providers that is cost prohibitive. An internationally acceptable approach is needed to satisfy the GUAN climate continuity needs and at the same mitigate the expenses for establishing bias corrections for various radiosonde types by the countries providing GUAN network radiosonde measurements. This paper will outline an approach for selecting a climatologically representative subset from the GUAN for acquiring overlapping flight data to establish bias transfer functions from new radiosonde sensor suites. It will also explore approaches to determine if changes in radiosondes require establishment of new bias determinations. Finally, a consortium approach will be outlined for countries with only one to several radiosonde stations...|$|R
40|$|Southern Greenland {{is home to}} {{a number}} of weather systems {{characterized}} by high speed low-level winds that are the result of topographic flow distortion. These systems include tip jets, barrier winds and katabatic flows. Global atmospheric reanalyses have proven to be important tools in furthering our understanding of these systems and their role in the climate system. However, there is evidence that their mesoscale structure may be poorly resolved in these global products. Here output from the regional Arctic System Reanalysis (ASRv 1 – 30 km and ASRv 2 – 15 km grid resolutions) are compared to the global ERA-Interim Reanalysis (ERA-I– 80 km grid resolution), focusing on their ability to represent winds in the vicinity of southern Greenland. Comparisons are made to observations from surface and <b>upper-air</b> <b>stations,</b> as well as from research aircraft flights during the Greenland Flow Distortion Experiment (GFDex). The ERA-I reanalysis has a tendency to underestimate high wind speeds and overestimate low wind speeds, which is reduced in ASRv 1 and nearly eliminated in ASRv 2. In addition, there is generally a systematic reduction in the root mean square error between the observed and the reanalysis wind speeds from ERA-I to ASRv 1 to ASRv 2, the exception being low-level marine winds where the correspondence is similar in all reanalyses. Case studies reveal that mesoscale spatial features of the wind field are better captured in ASRv 2 as compared to the ERA-I or ASRv 1. These results confirm that a horizontal grid size on the order of 15 km is needed to characterize the impact that Greenland’s topography has on the regional wind field and climate.

Moreover, the random uncertainty of a time series from one instrument can be reduced by ~ 60 % by constraining the measurements with those from another instrument. The best reduction of random uncertainty is achieved by conditioning Raman lidar measurements with microwave radiometer measurements.
