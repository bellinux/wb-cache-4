40|$|Underwater welding using {{shielded}} {{metal arc welding}} (SMAW) on US naval Vessels is very attractive because {{of the ability to}} effect repairs without costly dry dock expenses. In the past the primary problems with underwater wet weldments on steels utilizing SMAW with ferritic electrodes, were <b>underbead</b> <b>cracking</b> in the heat affected zone (HAZ), slag inclusions, oxide inclusions, and porosity. To avoid <b>underbead</b> <b>cracking</b> three weld samples were made using an austenitic nickel weld metal with an Oxylance coating at 10 feet of salt water, 25 feet of salt water, and 33 feet of salt water. A final sample was made using austenitic nickel weld metal with a Broco coating at 33 feet of salt water. Because of the ductility of the austenitic nickel weld metal no <b>underbead</b> <b>cracking</b> occurred, however porosity and high inclusion counts were found in all four samples. The average size of the inclusion increased with increasing depth. The Broco sample exhibited far greater porosity than did the 0 xylance samples. This work addresses quality of the welds, mechanisms for the formation of the inclusions, and analysis of the difference between the Oxylance and Broco weld rods[URL]...|$|R

Naval Vessels is highly desirable {{due to the}} ability of performing repairs without costly dry dock expenses. The primary problem with underwater wet weldments is <b>underbead</b> <b>cracking</b> in the heat affected zone (HAZ). The fundamental factors causing <b>underbead</b> <b>cracking</b> in underwater wet weldments using a shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) process are high quench rates, slag inclusions, diffusible hydrogen levels and porosity. The weld metal analysis included use of optical and scanning microscopy as well as microhardness testing. Three weld samples made at 5 deg C, 12 deg C, and 25 deg C water temperature were analyzed in this thesis. HAZ <b>underbead</b> <b>cracking</b> was present in all three welds analyzed although the 5 deg C sample was the only weld that exhibited extensive cracking whereas the 25 deg C sample only had cracking near the upper 50 % of the weld passes. Crack origination in all three samples near the cap was evident and was most likely due to small levels of bead tempering at this location. This thesis addresses the mechanisms of the cracking as well as the effects of diffusible hydrogen, cooling rates, and water temperatures on wet weldments[URL] junior grade, United States Coast Guar...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedSpecifications for Underwater Welding {{have not yet}} addressed the effect of water temperature on weldment microstructure. The environmental effects on Underwater Wet Welding using a shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) process are severe with higher quenching rates, porosity, slag inclusions and diffusible hydrogen levels. One of {{the problems associated with}} these high quenching rates and high diffusible hydrogen levels is the increased likelihood of <b>underbead</b> <b>cracking</b> in the heat affected zone (HAZ), particularly with steel weldment which have a higher carbon equivalent (approximately greater than 0. 3). In this work, the <b>underbead</b> <b>cracking</b> resulting in three underwater test welds made on ASTM 516 grade 70 steel three different water temperatures (2. 8 deg C, 10 deg C and 31 deg C) was investigated. This was done by optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and by making microhardness measurements. HAZ <b>underbead</b> <b>cracking</b> was observed in all three weldments, but was much less prevalent in the 31 deg C sample and could only be seen at high magnifications in the optical microscope. The cracking in this weldment only appeared to occur in isolated regions where head tempering had been ineffective for some reason. The weldments made at 10 deg C and 2. 8 deg C both showed extensive evidence of <b>underbead</b> HAZ <b>cracking</b> typical of that associated with rapid cooling rates, high diffusible hydrogen levels and hard microstructures. SEM studies of the surfaces of these cracks showed evidence for transgranular failure with secondary cracking, both of which are typical of hydrogen induced cracking. This work highlights the importance of water temperature, quenching and diffusible hydrogen levels in underwater wet welding. This is an issue of critical importance in the future wet welding structural repair of Naval ships[URL] United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|The notched-tensile, tensile, {{and bend}} {{properties}} of GTA welds in T- 111 and ASTAR- 811 C sheet were determined following {{a wide range}} of thermal exposures in order to define changes in ductility and mechanical property behavior due to weld aging response. No notch sensitivity or unusual tensile response was noted for any of the conditions evaluated. An aging response was noted for the bend ductile-brittle transition temperature determinations on both T- 111 and ASTAR- 811 C welds. A tentative explanation for the observed response of each alloy is presented. In addition, the interrelationship of mechanical and chemical factors leading to <b>underbead</b> <b>cracking</b> in T- 111 was investigated. The problem was shown to be amenable primarily to chemical solutions, such as alloy compositional changes. This was demonstrated by the improved performance of ASTAR- 811 C over T- 111 in plate weld studies. Only modest success was achieved using procedural techniques as a means of eliminating <b>underbead</b> <b>cracking...</b>|$|R
40|$|The work {{detailed}} {{in this paper}} was performed to determine the likelihood of cracking during and after welding of 10 mm thick, high hardness, armour steel plate in conditions of high restraint. All welding was performed using the pulsed {{gas metal arc welding}} process in the flat position. High restraint conditions were tested using the Y-groove test. Welds were performed with ferritic, austenitic and duplex austenitic /ferritic electrodes. <b>Underbead</b> <b>cracking,</b> a typical form of hydrogen induced cracking, was observed in the hardened region of the heat affected zone of ferritic welds where the heat input was 0. 5 kJ/mm and the preheat was 75 °C or less. No cracking was observed at this heat input when the preheat was raised to 150 °C. When the heat input was raised to 1. 2 kJ/mm, no cracking was observed, even when preheat was not used. <b>Underbead</b> <b>cracking</b> was not observed in either austenitic or duplex welds. However, the duplex welds were found to be susceptible to weld metal solidification cracking when the heat input used was low, 0. 5 kJ/mm. These cracks did not occur when the heat input was raised to 1. 2 kJ/mm...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a series of}} experiments on fourteen different assemblies of fillet weld joints produced by both underwater and in-air welding. Mechanical properties of underwater fillet welds in terms of strength, ductility, and failure modes are investigated in this study. Weld profiles, hardness distributions, and metallographic features of underwater welds are also examined. The study indicates that underwater fillet weld joints have larger strength but smaller ductility when compared with their counterpart in-air ones. The increase in strength ranges from 6. 9 % to 41. 0 %, and the decrease in ductility is about 50 % for most of weld assembly types. Underwater fillet weld joints on corroded SY 295 steel exhibit inferior ductility due to <b>underbead</b> <b>cracks.</b> Based on the test results, the paper proposes a practical method to model underwater welds in finite element analysis...|$|R

Power variations in these welds was achieved by altering the welding speed, voltage and current and were as follows (in kJ/mm); 0. 7, 1. 1, 1. 2, 1. 6 and 2. 2. No evidence was found of either weld metal or <b>underbead</b> HAZ <b>cracking</b> {{in any of the}} welds illustrating the advantage of low carbon steel for both weld wire and base plate. Microhardness traverses across both the weld metals and HAZs gave a maximum. Vickers diamond pyramid hardness of 345 HV in the coarse grain HAZ next to the fusion line in the lowest power weld; for the highest power weld this was somewhat lower at 328 HV. These are well below 375 which is usually considered to be the lowest Vickers Hardness value for which severe hydrogen induced cold cracking is observed in this type of steel. Optical, scanning and transmission electron microscopy studies of the coarse grain HAZ microstructure in the regions of maximum hardness was correlated with the continuous cooling transformation diagram for this steel and good agreement between observed and predicted microstructures was obtained.
