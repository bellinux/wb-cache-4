25|$|What is {{sometimes}} {{known as the}} fourth phase shifted the dental fricatives to plosives. This shift occurred late enough that <b>unshifted</b> forms {{are to be found}} in the earliest Old High German texts, and thus it can be dated to the 9th or 10th century. This shift spread much further north than the others, eventually reaching all continental West Germanic languages (hence excluding only English). It is therefore not uniquely High German; it is nonetheless often grouped together with the other shifts, as it did spread from the same area. The shift took several centuries to spread north, appearing in Dutch only during the 12th century, and in Frisian and Low German not for another century or two after that.|$|E

Assuming {{that the}} scoping discipline for names or channels is static, that notion {{can be characterized}} in terms of so–called normal bisimulation {{and in terms of}} π-calculus bisimulation. This paper provides a new characterization. Specifically, late context bisimulation in the static setting is characterized as ordinary delay bisimulation. The basis of that is a new operational semantics for higher–order processes, where higher–order communication is replaced by the coupling of trigger actions. These actions are freshly generated whenever, in the original semantics, an input or output would occur. To obtain the characterization, those actions must be normalized; to achieve this normalization, in turn, a novel scheme of shifting and <b>unshifting</b> actions in used...|$|R

However common customizations cannot be abstracted using the standard techniques of textual identifiers and ordinal positions. These difficulties are distilled into a challenge problem to evaluate potential solutions. A solution is proposed based on field trees, a new data model for software artifacts that provides persistent identifiers and <b>unshifting</b> positions within sequences.

40|$|De-Noising {{with the}} {{traditional}} (orthogonal, maximally-decimated) wavelet transform sometimes exhibits visual artifacts; we attribute some of these – for example, Gibbs phenomena {{in the neighborhood of}} discontinuities – to the lack of translation invariance of the wavelet basis. One method to suppress such artifacts, termed “cycle spinning ” by Coifman, is to “average out ” the translation dependence. For a range of shifts, one shifts the data (right or left as the case may be), De-Noises the shifted data, and then <b>unshifts</b> the de-noised data. Doing this for each of a range of shifts, and averaging the several results so obtained, produces a reconstruction subject to far weaker Gibbs phenomena than thresholding based De-Noising using the traditional orthogonal wavelet transform. Cycle-Spinning over the range of all circulant shifts can be accomplished in order nlog 2 (n) time; it is equivalent to de-noising using the undecimated or stationary wavelet transform. Cycle-spinning exhibits benefits outside of wavelet de-noising, for example in cosine packet denoising, where it helps suppress ‘clicks’. It also has a counterpart in frequency domain de-noising, where the goal of translation-invariance is replaced by modulation invariance, and the central shift-De-Noise-unshift operation is replaced by modulate-De-Noise-demodulate. We illustrate these concepts with extensive computational examples; all figures presented here are reproducible using the WaveLab software package. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractContrast {{sensitivity}} functions (CSFs) of 25 infants {{were measured}} longitudinally at 4, 6 and 8 {{months of age}} using a preferential-looking method and the method of constant stimuli. Sine-wave gratings varied from 0. 27 to 4. 32 c/deg, contained eight unattenuated cycles (with edges tapered to uniform gray), and rose to the desired contrast in 2 sec. (1) The average CSF was described on log-log coordinates by a band-pass function. With development it increased in overall sensitivity to contrast, shifted its peak toward slightly higher spatial frequencies, and increased its high frequency cutoff. (2) Log sensitivity at the CSF peak was slightly higher for female than male infants at 6 months, consistent with the hypothesis that vernier acuity (which also may differ between the sexes at this age) is partly mediated by analyzers tuned to low frequencies. (3) Within age groups the individual differences were such that log sensitivities for neighboring spatial frequencies generally correlated more highly than distant frequencies. With development the correlations among distant frequencies below 1. 0 c/deg increased. Monte Carlo simulations of a model that shifts spatial analyzers to higher frequencies with age reproduced these results but simulations of adultlike, <b>unshifting</b> analyzers did not.

5000|$|Many of the non-alphanumeric {{characters}} were positioned {{to correspond to}} their shifted position on typewriters; an important subtlety is that these were based on mechanical typewriters, not electric typewriters. Mechanical typewriters followed the standard set by the Remington No. 2 (1878), the first typewriter with a shift key, and the shifted values of [...] were [...] — early typewriters omitted 0 and 1, using O (capital letter o) and l (lowercase letter L) instead, but [...] and [...] pairs became standard once 0 and 1 became common. Thus, in ASCII [...] {{were placed in the}} second stick, positions 1-5, corresponding to the digits 1-5 in the adjacent stick. The parentheses could not correspond to 9 and 0, however, because the place corresponding to 0 was taken by the space character. This was accommodated by removing [...] (underscore) from 6 and shifting the remaining characters, which corresponded to many European typewriters that placed the parentheses with 8 and 9. This discrepancy from typewriters led to bit-paired keyboards, notably the Teletype Model 33, which used the left-shifted layout corresponding to ASCII, not to traditional mechanical typewriters. Electric typewriters, notably the IBM Selectric (1961), used a somewhat different layout that has become standard on computers — following the IBM PC (1981), especially Model M (1984) — and thus shift values for symbols on modern keyboards do not correspond as closely to the ASCII table as earlier keyboards did. The [...] pair also dates to the No. 2, and the [...] pairs were used on some keyboards (others, including the No. 2, did not shift [...] (comma) or [...] (full stop) so they could be used in uppercase without <b>unshifting).</b> However, ASCII split the [...] pair (dating to No. 2), and rearranged mathematical symbols (varied conventions, commonly [...] ) to [...]|$|R

6000|$|Such {{at least}} has {{hitherto}} been my state of innocence. I here only wish briefly to recall the special, extraordinary, and hitherto unprecedented circumstances which led me in cold blood, and being of sound mind, to turn out my pockets.

The time was towards evening, but it might have been anything, for everything resembling earth or sky or light or shade was painted out as if with a great wet brush by an <b>unshifting</b> sheet of quite colourless rain. I had no books or newspapers. I had not even a pencil and a scrap of paper with which to write a religious epic.

When I find myself opposite the words [...] "Sunlight Soap" [...] I can exhaust all the aspects of Sun Worship, Apollo, and Summer poetry before I go on to the less congenial subject of soap. But there was no printed word or picture anywhere; there was nothing but blank wood inside the carriage and blank wet without. Now I deny most energetically that anything is, or can be, uninteresting. So I stared at the joints of the walls and seats, and began thinking hard on the fascinating subject of wood. Just as I had begun to realise why, perhaps, it was that Christ was a carpenter, rather than a bricklayer, or a baker, or anything else, I suddenly started upright, and remembered my pockets. I was carrying about with me an unknown treasury. I had a British Museum and a South Kensington collection of unknown curios hung all over me in different places. I began to take the things out.|$|R
40|$|The Kaili Formation of South China is a ~ 200 – 300 m thick {{succession}} of fine-grained siliciclastic sediments with minor carbonates that spans the proposed Cambrian Series 2 –Series 3 boundary interval, formerly the Early-Middle Cambrian boundary. It was deposited at low latitude on a slope lying between the Yangtze carbonate platform {{to the northwest}} and deep-water outer shelf facies of the Jiangnan Basin to the southeast. Because the Kaili Formation contains abundant and well-preserved fossils throughout, most importantly oryctocephalid trilobites that have a broad geographic distribution, and because {{it appears to be}} less condensed than other contemporaneous sections found on other paleocontinents, a section near Balang Village, Jianhe County, Guizhou Province, has been proposed as a candidate Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for the Cambrian Series 2 – 3 boundary. However, because the Kaili Formation is mudstone-dominated, {{it is not possible to}} determine from outcrop study whether a change in depositional regime or a condensed interval may be present around the proposed boundary. Because the proposed boundary interval coincides with the maximum flooding stage of a global transgression, it is possible that subtle, yet significant facies changes may occur within the mudstones that comprise the proposed boundary interval, rendering its utility as a potential GSSP questionable. Here, we present an analysis of a composite section of the complete Kaili Formation exposed along two ridges and in a road cut near Balang Village. The section was measured at the cm-scale and sampled every 1 m throughout the complete thickness of the unit, except where covered. Microfacies analysis of 138 samples, using thin sections, polished slabs, acetate peels, X-radiographs and scanning electron microscopy was conducted in the laboratory. These analyses confirm that depositional processes within the Kaili Formation were consistent and <b>unshifting</b> throughout complete thickness of the formation. Event-driven deposition was maintained across the Kaili Formation with no evidence for condensation present, even at the 5 – 20 μm scale. The signal of the global transgression in the boundary interval is manifest as a slight thinning of individual millimeter-scale event-deposited lamina from 50 to 55 m above the base of the formation, around the proposed GSSP boundary at 52. 8 m. The entire Kaili Formation appears to have been deposited below storm wave base, as no silt-sized or coarser clastic particles are present, and no evidence of cross-bedding or graded bedding occurs within any of the facies present within it. The great majority of its thickness, including the entirety of the proposed boundary interval, is comprised of mm-laminated calcareous claystones that exhibit randomly oriented clay microfabrics characteristic of deposition from turbid suspension by sediment-gravity flows...|$|R

40|$|We have no {{interest}} whatever in minimizing the continuing history of racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise abusive biologisms, or the urgency of their exposure, {{that has made the}} gravamen of so many contemporary projects of critique. At the same time, we fear — with installation of an automatic antibiologism as the <b>unshifting</b> tenet of `theory' — the loss of conceptual access to an entire thought-realm. (Sedgwick and Frank, 1995 : 15) I was left wondering what danger had been averted by the exclusion of biology. What does the nominative `biological or anatomical body' actually refer to? And what secures the separation of its inadmissible matter from the proper purview of Irigaray's textual interventions? When I asked a question to this effect it was met with a certain nervous comprehension. Deciding, perhaps, that I must still be immersed in a precritical understanding of the body, the speaker dismissed me with a revealing theatrical gesture. As if to emphasize the sheer absurdity of my question she pinched herself and commented `Well I don't mean this body'. And so it seemed with a gesture so matter of fact that it required no further comment, the fact of (the) matter was both decided and dispatched. (Kirby, 1997 : 70) Feminism has been as deeply implicated in routinized antiessentialism as any of our critical procedures. Even though questions of `the body' have become increasingly fashionable in all manner of feminist projects (surely `the body' has become, in a very short space of time, one of our most routinized theoretical gestures), the schedule of feminism's antibiologism has been little altered. In most of these projects on `the body', the body in question is pursued in its socially, experientially, or psychically constituted forms, but rarely in its physiologically, biochemically, or microbiologically constituted form, the idea of biological construction having been rendered either unintelligible or naive. Despite an avowed interest in the body, there is a persistent distaste for biological detail. (Wilson, 1998 : 14 — 15) These feminist theories have usually been reluctant to engage with biological data: they retain, and encourage, the fierce antibiologism that marked the emergence of second wave feminism. (Wilson, 2004 : 13) That feminist scholars are particularly prone to a `knee jerk constructivism' helps explain the reluctance of those in the humanities to engage seriously with the claims of science. (Squier, 2004 : 46) This book functions primarily as a reminder to social, political, and cultural theorists, particularly those interested in feminism, antiracism and questions of the politics of globalisation, that they have forgotten a crucial dimension of research, if not necessary to, then certainly useful for more incisively formulating the concepts on which they so heavily, if implicitly rely. It is written as a remembrance of what we have forgotten — not just the body, but that which makes it possible and which limits its actions: the precarious, accidental, contingent, expedient, striving, dynamic status of life in a messy, complicated, resistant, brute world of materiality, a world regulated by the exigencies, the forces, of space and time. We have forgotten the nature, the ontology, of the body, the conditions under which bodies are encultured, psychologized, given identity, historical location, and agency.

It put the spectator in good-humor to look at them, because there was still something of the old Arcadian life, the secure freedom of the antique age, in their way of surrendering their lips to strangers, as if there were no evil or impurity in the world.
