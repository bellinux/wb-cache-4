Moreover, that the global warming potential of methane is 21 times {{higher than that of}} carbon dioxide and it has highest generation (60 %) than other gases. Therefore, there is immense concern for its abatement or utilization from landfill areas. Compared to the west, the composition of municipal solid waste (MSW) in developing countries has higher (40 % - 60 %) organic waste. This would have potential to emit higher GHG’s from per ton of MSW compared to developed world. Beside that landfills areas in India are not planned or en- gineered generally low lying open areas, where MSW is indiscriminate disposed.

Results of systematic, long-term measurements of 137 Cs activities in mosses and in some edible mushroom species in North Croatia for the post-Chernobyl period (1986 – 2007) are summarized. The study was conducted in the Radiation Protection Unit of the Institute for Medical Research and Occupational Health in Zagreb, as a part of an extensive monitoring program of the Croatian environment. In the overall observed period the highest activity concentration of 137 Cs deposited by fallout has been recorded in 1986, which is the year of Chernobyl accident, causing peak 137 Cs activity concentration in moss of 8800 Bq/kg in May 1986. In the same period mean 137 Cs activity concentration in grass was 390 Bq/kg. The highest value of 137 Cs activity concentration in Cortinarius caperatus mushrooms of 1351 Bq/kg has been recorded in 1989. Fitting the measured 137 Cs activity concentrations to the theoretical curve the ecological half-life of 137 Cs in moss was found to be around 978 days, in grass around 126 days in the period 1986 – 1990, in Cortinarius caperatus mushroom around 5865 days (16. 1 years). Regarding the risk assessment to Croatian population, due to consumption of mushrooms, the collective effective dose for Croatian population, estimated to be about 35 mSv per year, was found to be quite low.

40|$|Commercial marine vessels {{range in}} size from small fishing boats (20 - 30 meters in length) to {{extremely}} large tanker ships (> 300 meters in length). These ships almost without exception use diesel engines for propulsion and auxiliary power generation. The larger ships, comprising bulk carriers, tankers and container carriers, utilize slow-speed diesel (SSD) engines that produce power in the 10 MW to 100 MW range. These engines typically consume heavy fuel oils (HFO), which are high in sulfur content (1 %- 4. 5 % by weight). Smaller vessels use medium-speed diesel (MSD) engines for propulsion, and generally all vessels will use MSD engines for auxiliary power, but may use more refined fuels such as marine diesel oil (MDO) or marine gas oil (MGO). These engines are extremely efficient, converting nearly all of the carbon in the fuel to CO 2, but also emitting NOx, SO 2, PM, and small quantities of CO and VOCs such as formaldehyde (CH 2 O) and ethene (C 2 H 4).

40|$|Abstract. Despite a steep {{decline in}} primary, traffic-related loads, {{lead in the}} {{environment}} is still much of an issue. Current atmospheric levels may be unmistakably reflecting {{the widespread use of}} cleaner fuels, yet decades of <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>emissions</b> from mobile sources have made lead to pervade every terrestrial (and aquatic) ecosystem, from where it keeps re-entering the lower troposphere, {{at least in terms of}} local circulation. The continuing surveillance of airborne-lead levels is thus necessary, not just for ensuring a strict compliance with regulatory decisions, but also for assisting in the implementation of remediation and/or rehabilitation policies. In Portugal, unleaded gasoline was made generally available in 1990, yet both leaded and lead-free varieties were commercialised until 1998. After that, all vehicles were compelled to use unleaded gasoline. Even though it is certainly too early for a full trend analysis of airborne levels and their response to the ban on lead, concentrations in ambient air over an important urban-industrial corridor within the Lisbon metropolitan area show a steady, sharp decrease through the last decade. Since 2000, airborne-lead data seems somewhat stabilised and, as far as busy conurbations are concerned, roughly within the values that were usually observed in the rural hinterland back in the mid 1990 s...|$|E

The Mer-Cure{trademark}system utilizes {{a small amount}} of Mer-Clean{trademark} sorbent that is injected into the flue gas stream for oxidation and adsorption of gaseous mercury. Mer-Clean{trademark} sorbents are carbon-based and prepared with chemical additives that promote oxidation and capture of mercury. The Mer-Cure{trademark} system is unique in that the sorbent is injected into an environment where the mercury capture kinetics is accelerated. The full-scale demonstration program originally included test campaigns at two host sites: LCRA's 480 -MW{sub e} Fayette Unit No. 3 and Reliant Energy's 190 -MW{sub e} Shawville Unit No. 3. The only demonstration tests actually done were the short-term tests at LCRA due to budget constraints. This report gives a summary of the demonstration testing at Fayette Unit No. 3. The goals for this Mercury Round 3 program, established by DOE/NETL under the original solicitation, were to reduce the <b>uncontrolled</b> mercury <b>emissions</b> by 90 % at a cost significantly less than 50 % of the previous target of $ 60, 000 /lb mercury removed.
