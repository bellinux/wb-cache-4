25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1987, Steimel {{endorsed}} a $30 million reduction in unemployment compensation payments. At the time Louisiana employers owed $1 billion to the <b>unemployment</b> <b>fund,</b> a situation Steimel termed another major deterrent to economic growth and a contributing factor to {{the high rate of}} unemployment in the state, which was 12.5 percent in 1986. According to Steimel, Louisiana employers were then paying $234 more per year per employee into the <b>unemployment</b> <b>fund</b> than were employers in competing southern states. The reduction approved by the legislature brought Louisiana in line with unemployment payments made by employers in neighboring states.|$|E
25|$|The {{unemployment}} compensation {{provisions of}} the Social Security Act of 1935 establish a tax imposed on employers. If, however, a state has established an approved unemployment compensation plan, the taxpayer is allowed to credit up to 90% of the federal tax paid to the state <b>unemployment</b> <b>fund.</b> In effect, the Act established a taxing structure designed to induce states to adopt consistent laws for funding and payment of unemployment compensation.|$|E
25|$|In 1926, Gold led {{a massive}} furriers' strike in New York City. The Joint Board's {{contract}} with the city's furriers expired on January 31, 1926. Among the union's demands were a reduction in working hours to the five-day, 40-hour work week; union inspection of shops; a 25 percent wage increase; an employer contribution of 3 percent of each workers' salary to an unemployment insurance fund; a single paid holiday; and equal division of work among employees (to eliminate favoritism). The employer's association refused to negotiate over the work week, <b>unemployment</b> <b>fund</b> or equal division of work, but agreed to seek a settlement on the other terms if the union would withdraw the other three demands. Led by Gold, the Joint Board {{was on the verge}} of doing so when IFWU President Oizer Shachtman accused the Joint Board of being infiltrated by communists. The Joint Board made its recommendation to the employers all the same, who—aware of Shachtman's opposition—promptly rejected it. The employers then instituted a lockout of 8,500 workers on February 11, 1926. The union responded by calling a general strike of all 12,000 fur workers in the city on February 16, 1926.|$|E

5000|$|When the Swedish state {{decreased}} {{its financial}} support to the <b>unemployment</b> <b>funds</b> (most of them union-run, a few funds aimed for small entrepreneurs and one independent fund) from January 2007 {{with the result that}} the membership fees to <b>unemployment</b> <b>funds</b> had to be raised considerably, union density declined from 77 % in 2006 to 71 % in 2008. In January 2014 the fund fees were restored to about the same level as before 2007. In 2015 Swedish union density was 69 % and the density of union <b>unemployment</b> <b>funds</b> 73 % (75 % if the independent Alfa fund is added).|$|R
50|$|Sweden {{uses the}} Ghent system, under which a {{significant}} proportion of unemployment benefits are distributed by union <b>unemployment</b> <b>funds.</b> <b>Unemployment</b> benefits are divided into a voluntary scheme with income related compensation up to a certain level and a comprehensive scheme that provides a lower level of basic support. The voluntary scheme requires a minimum of 12 months membership and 6 months employment during that time before any claims can be made. Employers pay a fee on top of the pre-tax income of their employees, which together with membership fees, fund the scheme (see <b>Unemployment</b> <b>funds</b> in Sweden).|$|R
2500|$|The {{level of}} {{unemployment}} benefits {{is dependent on}} former employment (the maximum benefit is at 90% of the wage) and at times also on membership of an <b>unemployment</b> <b>fund,</b> which is almost always—but need not be—administered by a trade union, and the previous payment of contributions. However, the largest share of the financing is still carried by the central government and is financed by general taxation, and only to a minor degree from earmarked contributions. There is no taxation, however, on proceeds gained from selling one's home (provided there was any home equity (...) [...] ), as the marginal tax rate on capital income from housing savings is around 0%.|$|E
50|$|Yleinen työttömyyskassa (YTK, General <b>Unemployment</b> <b>Fund),</b> {{formerly}} known as Loimaan kassa (Loimaa Fund), is the largest <b>unemployment</b> <b>fund</b> in Finland. It has over 330,000 members.|$|E
5000|$|In Sweden, an <b>unemployment</b> <b>fund</b> (arbetslöshetskassa) is an {{economic}} association tied to a trade union, except the <b>Unemployment</b> <b>fund</b> Alfa and a few unemployment funds for self-employed and employers.|$|E
50|$|In 2007 {{important}} aspects of the systems were revised. The Alliance for Sweden electoral coalition who won the 2006 elections endorsed the idea that each section of the labour market should carry its own costs of unemployment benefits paid out to put pressure on the wage level and make the demand for labour to rise again and unemployment diminish. They claimed that a substantially larger part of the costs for the insurance should be financed by individual fees of the involved workers, conceiving to stop the intra-fund solidarity mechanisms. Consequently, from January 2007 fees to <b>unemployment</b> <b>funds</b> were raised significantly, most in funds with a high unemployment rate among the members. From July 2008 the differentiation of fund fess increased considerably. Massive membership losses followed in funds and trade unions. From 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2008 Swedish unions lost in all 245 000 members (8% of active members) and union <b>unemployment</b> <b>funds</b> almost 400 000 members (11% of members). Including non-union <b>unemployment</b> <b>funds</b> (the independent Alfa <b>fund</b> and the <b>unemployment</b> <b>funds</b> for self-employed and employers) almost half a million members left the funds. From 1 January 2014 fund fees were restored to about the same level as before 2007.|$|R
50|$|Trade unions, employers' {{associations}} and collective agreements cover {{a large share}} of the employees in Sweden. The high coverage of collective agreements is achieved despite the absence of state mechanisms extending collective agreements to whole industries or sectors. Both the prominent role of collective bargaining {{and the way in which}} the high rate of coverage is achieved reflect the dominance of self-regulation (regulation by the labour market parties themselves) over state regulation in Swedish industrial relations. When the Swedish Ghent system was changed in 2007, resulting in considerably raised fees to <b>unemployment</b> <b>funds,</b> a substantial decline in union density and density of <b>unemployment</b> <b>funds</b> occurred.|$|R
40|$|The Danish <b>unemployment</b> {{insurance}} <b>funds</b> are at {{the moment}} {{in a period of}} time characterized by change. During {{the last couple of years}} there has been a series of remarkable amendments to the laws on the area that has changed the conditions under which the <b>unemployment</b> insurance <b>funds</b> function. Furthermore, the competition for members has increased, and many of the <b>unemployment</b> <b>funds</b> are experiencing a decrease in their membership. This has brought along a discussion of the relevance of the funds in their current form. The present Minister of employment has declared that the <b>unemployment</b> insurance <b>funds</b> should consider themselves as being examined in their handling of new responsibilities that the ‘welfare reform’ from 2007 has assigned to them. The circumstances position the <b>unemployment</b> insurance <b>funds</b> under pressure. They have to be both economically efficient, have a controlling and authoritative function towards the unemployed members, and at the same time attend to the interest of the members. This thesis takes its starting point in HK’s <b>unemployment</b> insurance <b>fund</b> that implemented major organisational changes in October 2007 centralising the <b>unemployment</b> insurance <b>fund</b> and dividing the employees into specialised sections, each with a specific part of the fund’s functions. The focus is on how HK’s <b>unemployment</b> insurance <b>fund,</b> through the organisational changes, has adapted to the conditions on the area, and how this affects the relation to the members. The thesis analyses this focus through a case study based on qualitative interviews in a local section of the <b>unemployment</b> insurance <b>fund,</b> supplemented with a survey sent to the majority of the employees in HK’s <b>unemployment</b> insurance <b>fund.</b> The theoretical foundation of the analysis is theory on institutional change, isomorphism, by DiMaggio and Powell and organisation theory by Mintzberg concerning organisational structures and configurations. The analysis has shown that the organisational changes in HK’s <b>unemployment</b> insurance <b>fund</b> have meant a significant change in the employees work, and the relation to the members. We found resistance towards the changes and a negative attitude among the employees. However, at the same time they also expressed advantages in the new way of dividing the functions and understanding relating to the need for change. The relation to the members has changed both due to the political and organisational changes. The employees feel the stress and difficulties due to the pressure on the <b>unemployment</b> insurance <b>fund</b> to be both controlling, a service organisation and economically sustainable. This affects the contact with the members, both because the form of communication has changed away from personal meetings towards electronic communication, and because they are the ones directly facing the challenges of being both controlling and service minded towards the members...|$|R

50|$|Because {{workers in}} many cases need {{to belong to a}} union to receive benefits, union {{membership}} is higher in countries with the Ghent system. Furthermore, the state benefit is a fixed sum, but the benefits from <b>unemployment</b> <b>funds</b> depend on previous earnings.|$|R
25|$|Today, the world's {{highest rates}} of union {{membership}} are in the Scandinavian countries. In 2010, the percentage of workers belonging to a union (labour union density) was 68.3% in Sweden and 54.8% in Norway, while it was 34.9% in Ireland and 18.4% in Germany. Excluding full-time students working part-time, Swedish union density was 69% in 2015 and 2016. In all the Nordic countries with a Ghent system—Sweden, Denmark and Finland—union density is about 70%. The considerably raised membership fees of Swedish union <b>unemployment</b> <b>funds</b> implemented by the new center-right government in January 2007 caused large drops in membership in both <b>unemployment</b> <b>funds</b> and trade unions.

40|$|The {{high rate}} of trade union {{membership}} in Nordic countries is often attributed {{to the way in}} which unemployment insurance is organised: that is, as a voluntary scheme which is administered by trade union-linked funds (the so-called Ghent system). However, since trade unions and <b>unemployment</b> insurance <b>funds</b> are formally independent from each other, and alternatives to traditional trade union-linked <b>unemployment</b> <b>funds</b> are available, it is far from clear why the more expensive option of a dual membership in trade union and unemployment insurance is generally favoured. Comparing current characteristics and the operation of the Ghent system in Denmark and Sweden, the article identifies incentives for joining an <b>unemployment</b> insurance <b>fund</b> per se and, secondly, factors which make such a dual membership appealing. It shows that some of these apply to both countries, such as the strong identification with trade unions or the lack of a transparent institutional separation; while others are country-specific, such as job search support in Denmark and access to improved benefit provision in Sweden. 2 Introduction...|$|R

5000|$|Minister for Finance Anders Borg {{presented}} the government's first budget on 16 October 2006. The budget contains {{many of the}} proposals that were prominent in the Alliance's election campaign: both the job deduction in the income tax, which will also be larger for old people {{to encourage them to}} remain in the labour market, and the [...] "fresh start jobs" [...] with reduced payroll tax for companies employing people who have been unemployed {{for more than a year}} will come into effect from 1 January 2007. Tax reductions for companies hiring young people and for domestic services are to come into effect on 1 July. The tax reductions announced in the budget total 42 billion Swedish kronor, of which the income tax deduction is 38.7 billion. Other changes include the ending of employers' co-financing of sickness benefit after the second week, reduction of unemployment benefits and considerably raised fees to <b>unemployment</b> <b>funds,</b> resulting in a substantial decline in union density and density of <b>unemployment</b> <b>funds.</b> <b>Unemployment</b> benefit would remain 80% of previous pay for 200 days then drop to 70%. Benefit would be payable for a maximum of 300 days, or 450 if the recipient has children.|$|R
