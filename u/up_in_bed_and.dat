25|$|Before {{he could}} be ordained a priest, Gabriel died in the retreat at Isola del Gran Sasso {{the early hours of}} February 27, 1862, in the {{presence}} of the community, holding close an image of Our Lady of Sorrows and smiling peacefully. Those who were with Gabriel when he died reported that at the moment of death, he sat <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> his face became radiant as he reached out to an otherwise unseen figure that was entering the room. It was the opinion of Father Norbert that Saint Gabriel had seen the Virgin Mary at the very moment of his death.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, [...] "Dear Jessie" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics, who {{complained about the}} overdone fantasy imagery of the song, but complimented its composition. Other reviewers likened the composition and performance to the style of The Beatles. The track was a moderate success commercially, reaching the top 10 in the United Kingdom and Ireland and the top 20 in Germany, Spain and Switzerland. The music video of [...] "Dear Jessie" [...] combines live action and animation, portraying a little girl waking <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> interacting with fantasy characters. Madonna appears in the video only as an animated, Tinker Bell-type fairy.|$|E
500|$|The {{sequence}} of Bart crashing down the stairwell to the Mafia bar {{is similar to}} a scene in the film GoodFellas, in which a young boy is employed by a Mafia as their messenger. All of the horses in the race that Bart bets on are named after a famous animated character's catchphrase: [...] "Ain't I a Stinker?" [...] (Bugs Bunny), [...] "Yabba Dabba Doo" [...] (Fred Flintstone), [...] "Sufferin' Succotash" [...] (Sylvester), [...] "That's All Folks" [...] (Porky Pig), [...] "I Yam What I Yam" [...] (Popeye), and Bart's catchphrases [...] "Eat my shorts" [...] and [...] "Don't have a cow". The Chiffons's song [...] "One Fine Day" [...] is heard when Bart serves drinks to the mobsters during a game of poker. The writers originally wanted to use the song [...] "Be My Baby" [...] by The Ronettes for the scene, but they could not clear the copyrights for it. In his room, Bart stores the Springfield Mafia's loot—a truckload of cartons of Laramie cigarettes. While strutting around the kitchen, he sings Frank Sinatra's song [...] "Witchcraft". The scene in which Bart wakes up screaming after having a nightmare about Skinner is a reference to a scene in the 1972 film The Godfather, in which Jack Woltz screams after waking <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> finding a decapitated horse head by his side. Skinner frees himself from being trapped under the newspapers in a way similar to the character Angus MacGyver's escapes in the American television series MacGyver.|$|E

2500|$|From the {{beginning}} of 2006, the Saturday show was moved to BBC Two during the BBC's experiment involving their Saturday morning line-up - BBC Two shows were moved to BBC One in return. The final episode was broadcast live on BBC Two on Saturday 11 March 2006. From {{the end of the}} previous Sunday and throughout the final episode they built up to the big finale, which involved all the cast members singing a song and getting covered in [...] "creamy muck muck". Then, for the first time ever, viewers were shown the outside of the bungalow, which subsequently collapsed under creamy muck muck before being kicked over by a giant foot. A final post-credits scene shows that the whole show was actually just a dream that the [...] "Big BBC Boss" [...] (Alan Yentob) was having, à la Newhart and The Brittas Empire. The episode ends with him waking <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> saying to the camera, [...] "Oh, what a terrible dream!" [...] Dick and Dom then sit up either side of him and end the show with a theatrical cackle.|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Britling sat <b>up</b> <b>in</b> his <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> beat at the bedclothes {{with his}} fists. He uttered uncompleted vows, [...] "From this hour forth ... from this hour forth...." ...|$|R

60|$|She turned round quickly. He {{was sitting}} <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed,</b> <b>and</b> the sunbeam was {{traveling}} up toward him.|$|E
50|$|In a post-credits scene, Rin, still alive, wakes <b>up</b> <b>in</b> her <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> finds Kuroneko's cat doll on her bed. She {{takes it}} and hugs it quietly, {{mourning}} Kuroneko's death.|$|R
60|$|In her {{excitement}} {{the sick}} woman raised herself <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the <b>bed,</b> <b>and</b> clutched the girl's thin arm. Her eyes were blazing and two scarlet spots glowed in her thin cheeks.|$|R
60|$|I sat <b>up</b> {{suddenly}} <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> {{turned on}} the light. It was barely two o'clock by my watch, but I felt sure that I had not been mistaken. Some one had knocked at my door.|$|R
60|$|Peter {{continued}} to cry, and soon his sobs woke Jane. She sat <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed,</b> <b>and</b> was interested at once.|$|E

60|$|Some time in {{the middle}} of the night, or maybe towards the early morning, Dolly, who was Mrs. X.'s sister, sat <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> listened.|$|E
60|$|Boone started <b>up</b> <b>in</b> his <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> stared wildly at some object which {{appeared}} {{to be at the}} foot of the bed. Gorman started too, and turned pale as his eyes followed those of the invalid.|$|R
60|$|He rose early after daybreak; but {{although}} {{he moved with}} as little noise as was possible, the slumbers of the hunted Prince were easily disturbed. He started <b>up</b> <b>in</b> his <b>bed,</b> <b>and</b> {{asked if there was}} any alarm.|$|R
6000|$|She started <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the <b>bed,</b> <b>and</b> turned deadly pale. It {{was evidently}} {{on the tip}} of her tongue to retort on me with the {{unbridled}} insolence of former times. She checked herself--laid her head back on the pillow--considered a minute--and then answered in these remarkable words: ...|$|R
6000|$|Amy sat <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed,</b> <b>and</b> put {{her arms}} round her mother's neck. 'Then he is happy again,' she whispered. 'I should like to hear all.' ...|$|E

60|$|I sat <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> listened intently. It {{seemed to}} me as if someone with a muffled hammer were trying to knock bricks out of the wall.|$|E
60|$|He {{accordingly}} {{ordered that}} all of his sons {{who were in the}} camp, and all the princes of his family, should be called in to his bedside.

60|$|My lord viscount sprang <b>up</b> <b>in</b> his <b>bed,</b> <b>and</b> flung {{his arms}} round Esmond. “God bl—bless...,” {{was all he}} said.

60|$|The weather now {{began to}} change, {{and the cold}} sea winds blew each night over Mary's garden. She did not know this, for she was always lying snugly tucked <b>up</b> <b>in</b> her <b>bed,</b> <b>and</b> the warm morning sun usually drove away the winds; but her mother knew it, and feared Mary's garden would suffer.|$|R
6000|$|I {{was awakened}} at about nine o'clock {{the next morning}} by a loud and {{persistent}} {{knocking at the door}} of my room. I sat <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> shouted, ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{a little}} after midnight that Dick awoke with a cough. He sat <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> opened his eyes to find the room almost filled with smoke.|$|E

5000|$|Each episode {{featured}} a self-contained mystery involving another persona of Fifth Corner. We {{began with the}} name Richard Braun, but then switched to George Thompson.

[...] "George" [...] switched our attention to Grandwell and the mystery of who the Fifth Corner was.|$|R
6000|$|My Lord Viscount sprang <b>up</b> <b>in</b> his <b>bed,</b> <b>and</b> flung {{his arms}} round Esmond. [...] "God bl--bless--" [...] {{was all he}} said.

5000|$|This is {{your last}} chance. After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill—the story ends, you wake <b>up</b> <b>in</b> your <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> believe {{whatever}} you want to believe. You take the red pill—you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes. Remember: all I'm offering is the truth. Nothing more.|$|R
