When Steinman's manager saw it, he responded 'It's a porno movie!' The two-day shoot ran over schedule and budget, costing £35,000 an hour. Russell and Steinman even designed a sequence where a motorcyclist would cycle up the steps of a local church-tower, jump out of the turrets at the top, and then explode; alas, the wardens of the church refused permission.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} African nations {{did not show}} <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>time,</b> for various reasons such as {{difficulties}} flying through Istanbul, and finalisation of monetary arrangements (teams must pay first, and then get reimbursed later). Former Kenyan Olympic participant {{and owner of the}} website Kenya Chess Masala said that the issue just paints Africa in bad image. On 5 September, the organisers confirmed at a press-conference that the host-nation was ready to pay for the poorer nations to travel. Bhari confirmed that the travel expenses were the main problem and wrote that 116 out of the planned 187 federations were on a travel subsidy, including his native Kenya whose players had not shown in the first rounds, though. He also explained that one of the biggest issues was the timing of the funding and that the teams were expected to pay on their own and be reimbursed upon arrival. Finally, Bhari had already reminded other federations to start planning their travel expenses for the 43rd Chess Olympiad in Batumi in 2018. In the end, 10 African nations did not arrive (Kenya, Cameroon, Mali, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Burundi, Liberia, Seychelles, Senegal, Central African Republic).|$|E

Some time later, Oskar shows Eli a private place he knows. Unaware that Eli is a vampire, Oskar suggests that they form a blood bond, and cuts his hand, asking Eli to do the same. Eli, thirsting for blood but not wanting to harm Oskar, laps up his spilled blood before running away. Lacke's girlfriend, Virginia, is subsequently attacked by Eli. Lacke turns <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> to interrupt the attack. Virginia survives, but soon discovers that she has become painfully sensitive to sunlight. Seeking Lacke, Virginia visits Gösta, only to be fiercely attacked by Gösta's cats. In the hospital, Virginia, who has realized what she has become, asks an orderly to open the blinds in her room. When the sunlight streams in, she bursts into flames.|$|E

25|$|The {{destruction}} {{of so much}} of the Army had immediate strategic ramifications. Spain could no longer continue its planned advance on Paris, and within five weeks had begun to make the first moves towards a negotiations that would culminate in the 1648 Peace of Westphalia. Traditionally, historians have traced the decline and collapse of Spanish military power in Europe from the battle of Rocroi; the defeat, however, can be overstated. A substantial part of the Army of Flanders, some 6,000 men under Beck, failed to turn <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> to fight at Rocroi and formed the nucleus of the new Army of Flanders afterwards. Some recent historians have increasingly seen 1643 as a somewhat arbitrary date – Spain remained powerful and capable of defending itself in Flanders for many years afterwards.|$|E

The reason for Jiang Wei's defeat at Shanggui was the failure of the Shu general Hu Ji to show <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> with reinforcements to assist Jiang Wei. The failure of this ninth expedition resulted in Shu sustaining heavy losses of lives and resources; the people of Shu resented and hated Jiang Wei even more. Jiang Wei wrote a memorial to the Shu imperial court, requesting to be demoted as punishment. The court approved and demoted him to the position of General of the Guards (衞將軍). However, despite his demotion, Jiang Wei was still allowed to act in the capacity of his previous appointment as General-in-Chief (大將軍).|$|E

After multiple shots with the chair, McMahon targeted Kane's knee using the ring post. Later, Kane attempted to perform a big boot on McMahon, but he accidentally hit the referee. After back and forth action, Kane attempted a Tombstone Piledriver onto the steel steps on McMahon but McMahon countered into a bulldog and performed a Coast-to-Coast into the steel steps, which were positioned against Kane.

25|$|In Game 2, it was James Shields who got {{the start}} against C. J. Wilson. With runners on the corners in the 3rd inning, Shields went to 1st base for a pickoff attempt, but the throw over was errant, {{allowing}} the runner to score from 3rd base. Ian Kinsler launched a solo homer to left in the 4th, putting Texas up 2–0. In the 5th, Shields {{was removed from the}} game with two on and one out, being replaced by Chad Qualls to face Michael Young. With a 2–2 count, Young checked his swing on a pitch that was called a ball. The Rays appealed to first base umpire Jerry Meals, but Meals ruled that Young held <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>time,</b> drawing the ire of the Rays dugout. Replays showed that Young may not have checked in time, and had the ruling been made that he did not, it would have resulted in a strikeout. Instead, Young went deep to center on the very next pitch for a 3-run home run, putting the Rangers up 5–0. Rays manager Joe Maddon went out to the mound to talk to his pitcher after the home run, but began arguing with home plate umpire Jim Wolf about the check swing, which led to Wolf ejecting Maddon from the game. Texas added another run in the 6th inning, and held the Rays scoreless, winning 6–0 and taking a commanding 2–0 lead in the best-of-five series.|$|E
25|$|In Chapter 100, Sima Yi warns Cao Zhen that Shu forces will, {{within the}} next ten days, launch an attack on Mount Qi (祁山; the mountainous regions around present-day Li County, Gansu), a {{strategic}} location which would allow further incursions into the Wei heartland. After Cao Zhen refuses to believe Sima Yi, the two make a bet {{and each of them}} leads half of the Wei army to guard the valleys to the east and west of Mount Qi. Cao Zhen prepares for battle halfheartedly as he thinks that he is right. Seven days later, when his scouts report that a small number of Shu soldiers are approaching the valley, Cao Zhen sends his subordinate Qin Liang (秦良) to lead 5,000 men to survey the terrain. As Qin Liang and his men travel deeper into the valley, they fall into an ambush by Shu forces led by Liao Hua and Guan Xing and are completely destroyed. The Shu forces then disguise themselves by wearing the Wei soldiers' armour and uniform and infiltrate Cao Zhen's camp. In the meantime, Sima Yi encounters and defeats Shu forces led by Wei Yan. When he learns that no enemy forces have been spotted at Cao Zhen's side, he immediately leads his troops to Cao Zhen's camp. By then, the Shu infiltrators have launched a surprise attack within Cao Zhen's camp. Sima Yi shows <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>time,</b> drives back the Shu forces, and saves Cao Zhen. Cao Zhen feels so ashamed of himself that he falls sick. Zhuge Liang writes a letter to Cao Zhen to taunt and insult him. Cao Zhen becomes so angry after reading the letter that he coughs blood and dies that night in his camp. Sima Yi sends his dead body back to Luoyang, where he receives a proper burial.|$|E
