5000|$|A thermal {{upconversion}} mechanism {{has also}} been proposed. This mechanism {{is based on the}} absorption of photons with low energies in the upconverter, which heats up and re-emits photons with higher energies. To make this process possible, the density of optical states of the upconverter has to be carefully engineered to provide frequency- and angularly-selective emission characteristics. For example, a planar thermal upconverting platform can have a front surface that absorbs low-energy photons incident within a narrow angular range, and a back surface that efficiently emits only high-energy photons. These surface properties can be realized through designs of photonic crystal, and theories and experiments have been demonstrated on thermophotovoltaics and radiation cooling.

40|$|AbstractUp-converters use {{radiation}} normally {{transmitted by}} the solar cell and converts it to radiation, {{which can be}} converted to electric energy. Therefore, an <b>up-converter</b> should be placed on the rear side of a bifacial cell. This has the advantage that no impairment of the radiation impinging on the solar cell takes place. The number of photons that may be converted is limited by the absorption range of the <b>up-converter</b> and the efficiency of the up-conversion.

40|$|In {{order to}} satisfy the world’s energy demands while {{simultaneously}} preserving the sustainability of the environment, it is inevitable to shift the reliance of fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. Photovoltaic is the fastest growing energy source {{in the world and}} the cost of production have reduced significantly over the past decade for it to be considered as a cost-competitive solution. Increasing the cell efficiency and bringing the cost down towards grid parity continues to be the primary motivation for research and development in photovoltaics technology. The third generation photovoltaics involve novel cell designs and concepts that have potentials in achieving very high efficiency and low cost solar cells. These include tandem solar cells, quantum well/dot solar cells, hot carrier solar cells and <b>up-converters.</b> Resonant tunnelling effect in Si/SiO 2 quantum well structures could find potential applications in all-Si tandem cells in the form of superlattice and energy selective contacts in hot carrier solar cells in the form of double barrier structure. The fabrication of crystalline Si/SiO 2 quantum well to achieve the desired confinement effect is no trivial task. In this thesis, the structures were deposited by RF magnetron reactive sputtering followed by post thermal treatment to crystallize the amorphous silicon layer. The enhancement of crystallization temperature has been observed experimentally for low dimensional Si well in the order of a few nanometres. The crystallinity has also been experimentally demonstrated to be strongly dependent on the annealing temperature rather than the duration. The size of silicon nanocrystals was calculated and compared using different analytical approaches. It was observed that the Si thickness and annealing temperature both plays a role in the size of the nanocrystals. The bandgap enhancement was evident from variation of luminescence energy between 1. 3 to 1. 8 eV as function of Si well thickness. The origin of this luminescence was studied.

40|$|Wideband, {{high-data}} rate {{wireless communication}} systems generally suffer- fer from low-efficiency or poor linearity. To realize both a linear response and high- efficiency, {{a variety of}} linearization approaches have been proposed. Polar transmitters separate the signal into amplitude and phase components. The phase component drives a high-efficiency power amplifier (PA) while the amplitude component drives the power supply. While this improves {{the efficiency of the}} PA, the amplitude modulator requires much higher bandwidth compared to the input signal. Envelope tracking systems generally struggle to reach bandwidths exceeding 100 MHz due to the difficulty to realize supply modulators that remain efficient over wide bandwidth. An alternative to envelope tracking is linear amplification with nonlinear components (LINC) also called outphasing. In an outphasing transmitter, an input signal is separated into amplitude and phase components that are used to construct two constant-envelope phase-modulated signals. Therefore, high-efficiency PAs amplify the constant envelope signals and this improves the efficiency without degrading the linearity. The amplified signals are combined together to restore the amplitude and phase components of the output signal. Although, in theory, for an outphasing system combining two outphased signals would restore the original signal, any imbalance results in error. For example a phase mismatch between the two signals translates into phase and amplitude error in the combined signal which limits the control over the output power dynamic range. In this dissertation first the system level of the proposed outphasing modulator is presented to highlight the main blocks. Digital to analog converter (DAC) is introduced as one of the main blocks and the implemented 10 -bit power DAC is described. This DAC is implemented in 45 -nm CMOS SOI and is capable of delivering current swings sufficient for 6 V swing on a 50 -[Omega] load. This the highest swing reported in the literature for a high-resolution DAC. Then, the 10 -GHz wideband outphasing modulator is presented which includes four of the power DACs along with two I/Q <b>up-converters.</b> This modulator is also in 45 -nm CMOS SOI and can operate at 1. 1 Gbit/s by using 265 -QAM.

This is the first demonstration of the outphasing modulator for data rates above 1 Gbit/s. Finally, a polar modulator based on coupled oscillators is proposed.

Unfortunately, most stereo mixtures are underdetermined, i. e., there are more sound sources than audio channels. This condition makes the SSS problem especially difficult and stronger assumptions have to be taken, often related to the sparsity of the sources under some signal transformation. This thesis is focused on the application of SSS techniques to the spatial sound reproduction field. As a result, its contributions can be categorized within these two areas. First, two underdetermined SSS methods are proposed to deal efficiently with the separation of stereo sound mixtures. These techniques are based on a multi-level thresholding segmentation approach, which enables to perform a fast and unsupervised separation of sound sources in the time-frequency domain. Although both techniques rely on the same clustering type, the features considered by each of them are related to different localization cues that enable to perform separation of either instantaneous or real mixtures. Additionally, two post-processing techniques aimed at improving the isolation of the separated sources are proposed. The performance achieved by several SSS methods in the resynthesis of WFS sound scenes is afterwards evaluated by means of listening tests, paying special attention to the change observed in the perceived spatial attributes. Although the estimated sources are distorted versions of the original ones, the masking effects involved in their spatial remixing make artifacts less perceptible, which improves the overall assessed quality. Finally, some novel developments related to the application of time-frequency processing to source localization and enhanced sound reproduction are presented. Cobos Serrano, M. (2009).

40|$|The {{object of}} this {{doctoral}} dissertation {{is the study of}} wireless transmission and reception of Ultra-Wideband (UWB) signal. This term means that the signal’s absolute spectrum exceeds 500 MHz, or the fractional bandwidth is greater than 20 %. Moreover, this thesis focuses on software radio techniques. This means that both the receiver and the transmitter uses almost exclusively programmable devices such as DSPs, FPGAs, while analog parts such as mixers, filters and conventional <b>up-converters</b> or down-converters are eliminated as much as possible. There are several ways to create an UWB radio signal. In this study we selected the technique that is based on very short pulses, which is known in the literature as UWB Impulse Radio. Impulse Radio technology doesn’t use a carrier. The desired spectrum is achieved by producing appropriate pulses with width on the order of 1 nsec. The low power and high data rate (~ 100 Mbps) make this new technology viable and competitive in the telecommunications field. This technology is intended to be used at the indoor environment in applications of Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN). The range doesn’t exceed 10 m, as determined by the standard IEEE 802. 15. 3 a. For outdoor applications the equivalent standard IEEE 802. 15. 4 a has been created. In this dissertation, only the first case is taken into account, therefore all experimental procedures were performed in indoor environment. A theoretical study of the reception system is derived with the criterion of the probability of error as a function of channel estimation, noise, analog to digital restrictions and the characteristics of the digital matched filtering for signal detection. An UWB transmitter has been implemented and used in several experimental procedures. The transmitter is fully reprogrammable and is able to transmit pulses with modulations such as amplitude modulation (On-Off Keying) and Pulse Position Modulation (PPM). The latter is the most interesting and {{this is the one that}} used. Our system uses the binary and the quarternary modulation (BPPM, QPPM). Within this thesis, wireless transmission and reception has been done, using the transmitter constructed and a digital oscilloscope. The stages of reception and signal processing are performed by software on a personal computer (PC). Furthermore, an appropriate experimental procedure has been accomplished in order to characterize the indoor wireless channel. One of the most effective methods to find the channel impulse response is the subtractive deconvolution in time domain, using the CLEAN algorithm. In this way the effects of antennas and transmission system are recanted, revealing the response of the channel. Finally, one can not ignore the importance of antennas in any wireless link. UWB antennas have special features that have to do with the use of ultra-wideband spectrum. A known type of UWB antenna is altered with suitable notches and studied experimentally and via simulation. ...|$|R

40|$|Coherent optical OFDM (CO-OFDM) has {{recently}} been proposed and the proof-of-concept transmission experiments have shown its extreme robustness against chromatic dispersion and polarization mode dispersion. In this paper, we first review the theoretical fundamentals for CO-OFDM and its channel model in a 2 x 2 MIMO-OFDM representation. We then present various design choices for CO-OFDM systems and perform the nonlinearity analysis for RF-to-optical <b>up-converter.</b> We also show the receiver-based digital signal processing to mitigate self-phase-modulation (SPM) and Gordon-Mollenauer phase noise, which {{is equivalent to the}} midspan phase conjugation...|$|E
40|$|Digital {{conversion}} is {{a fundamental}} part of many digital radio systems, which include upconversion of the discrete baseband signal stream into a high-resolution radio signal at the transmitter, and down-conversion of a high-resolution radio signal back into a baseband signal at the receiver. In this chapter, we cover the basics of digital conversion (analog to digital and digital to analog), the functionality of digital <b>up-converter</b> and digital down-converter in relation to conversion between intermediate frequency and baseband {{with the emphasis on}} the implementation of the DDC and DUC for standard wireless communication systems...|$|E
