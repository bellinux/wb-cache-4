40|$|Abstract INTRODUCTION: Mucocele {{is a rare}} {{pathology}} of {{the appendix}} characterized by expansion of the lumen for a slow storage of mucous. Represents the 0. 2 - 0. 3 % of all the appendectomies. Clinical signs and the symptoms {{are similar to those}} of the acute appendicitis, while the disease is occasionally recorded and the diagnosis is essentially histological. AIM OF STUDY: To recall the clinical and anatomopathological features of mucocele evaluating the possible evolutions of this rare appendicular pathology according to the <b>updating</b> <b>reports</b> of the literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study of a clinical case. DISCUSSION: In this study diagnostic chriteria and prognostic factors are revised. Authors evaluate anatomopathological classification, possibility of evolution in a preneoplastic and neoplastic lesion and association with other colon cancers. The surgical treatment is evaluated too. CONCLUSIONS: A correct preoperative mucocele diagnosis is emphasized as indispensable in the choice of the proper surgical treatment since a good prognosis is consequent to a radical treatment...|$|E

40|$|Caching at {{the mobile}} client is {{prospective}} technique that {{can reduce the}} number of uplink requests, lighten the server load. However, Variable data size, data updates,limited client resource and frequent client disconnection make cache management a challenge. object caching is often used to improve the performance of mobile application. Consistency approach to maintaining cache consistency with the use of Invalidation (or) <b>update</b> <b>reports.</b> The server periodically broadcasts <b>updates</b> (or) invalidation <b>report</b> to clients. <b>update</b> <b>report</b> reflect the changes in the state database. A drawback of this method is that invalidation report impose a high processing load on clients. clients have to listen to all report,even through there may be no changes in the data caching. With the aim of reducing the cache consistency maintenance work. I have proposed agent based mechanism to save wireless bandwidth,reduce network traffic and reduce the workload in server.

40|$|Abstract — In {{wireless}} sensor networks, filters, which suppress data <b>update</b> <b>reports</b> within predefined error bounds, effectively {{reduce the}} traffic volume for continuous data collection. All prior filter designs, however, are stationary {{in the sense}} that each filter is attached to a specific sensor node and remains stationary over its lifetime. In this paper, we propose mobile filter, a novel design that explores migration of filters to maximize overall traffic reduction. A mobile filter moves upstream along the data collection path, with its residual size being updated according to the collected data. Intuitively, this migration extracts and relays unused filters, leading to more proactive suppressing of <b>update</b> <b>reports.</b> While extra communications are needed to move filters, we show through probabilistic analysis that the overhead is outrun by the gain from suppressing more data updates.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} for checking route oscillation of border gateway protocol (BGP) quickly, by which the privacy of routing policies of autonomous system (AS) can be respected. Firstly, route update chain tag (RUCT) is constructed to track the forwarding of <b>update</b> <b>report,</b> and local routing library is made to record the changing history of <b>update</b> <b>report.</b> Then route oscillation can be identified by analyzing correlative state of RUCT and local routing library. The characteristic {{of this approach is}} that an arbitrary AS can check route oscillation alone only by sharing its network ID, which greatly respects the privacy of routing policies for each AS. This paper shows that both looping in RUCT and consecutive positive-negative report in local record are sufficient conditions for route oscillation. Comparative experiments demonstrate the availability and efficiency of the proposed approach...|$|R
