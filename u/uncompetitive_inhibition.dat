40|$|The {{alkaline}} protease, savinase was {{chemically modified}} {{to enhance the}} productivity of the enzyme at low temperatures on a complex polymeric protein (azocasein) substrate. At 5 and 15 degrees C, savinase modified with ficol or dextran hydrolyzed fivefold more azocasein than the unmodified savinase. Kinetic studies showed that the catalytic improvements are associated with changes in <b>uncompetitive</b> substrate <b>inhibition</b> with K-i values of modified savinases sixfold higher than the unmodified savinase. Modeling of small-angle scattering data indicates that two substrate molecules bind on opposing sides of the enzyme. The combined kinetic and structural data indicate that the polysaccharide modifier sterically blocks the allosteric site and reduces substrate inhibition. In contrast to the properties of cold-active enzymes that generally manifest as low activation enthalpy and high flexibility, this study shows that increased activity and productivity at low temperature {{can be achieved by}} reducing <b>uncompetitive</b> substrate <b>inhibition,</b> and that this can be achieved using chemical modification with an enzyme in a commercial enzyme-formulation.

In Pseudomonas aeruginosa this reaction is a compulsory {{step in the}} assimilation of carbon and nitrogen when bacteria are growing in choline or choline precursors. The kinetic mechanisms of the NAD(+) - and NADP(+) -dependent reactions were examined by steady-state kinetic methods and by dinucleotide binding experiments. The double-reciprocal patterns obtained for initial velocity with NAD(P) (+) and for product and dead-end inhibition establish that both mechanisms are steady-state random. However, quantitative analysis of the inhibitions, and comparison with binding data, suggest a preferred route of addition of substrates and release of products in which NAD(P) (+) binds first and NAD(P) H leaves last, particularly in the NADP(+) -dependent reaction. Abortive binding of the dinucleotides, or their analogue ADP, in the betaine aldehyde site was inferred from total substrate inhibition by the dinucleotides, and parabolic inhibition by NADH and ADP. A weak partial <b>uncompetitive</b> substrate <b>inhibition</b> by the aldehyde was observed only in the NADP(+) -dependent reaction.
