5|$|Stefano Ghislotti {{wrote an}} article in Film Anthology which {{discusses}} how Nolan provides the viewer with the clues necessary to decode the sujet as we watch and help <b>us</b> <b>understand</b> the fabula from it. The color sequences include a brief overlap to help clue the audience into {{the fact that they}} are being presented in reverse order. The purpose of the fragmented reverse sequencing is to force the audience into a sympathetic experience of Leonard's defective ability to create new long-term memories, where prior events are not recalled, since the audience has yet to see them.|$|E

25|$|To {{choose an}} example that did not get much {{attention}} in the debate (because it was shared by both sides), the Solow-Swan model assumes a continuously-attained equilibrium with 'full employment' of all resources. Contrary to Keynesian economics, saving determines investment in these models (rather than vice versa). The fact that the critique was also stated entirely using exactly {{the same kind of}} unrealistic assumptions meant that {{it was very difficult to}} do anything but 'criticize' Solow and Swan. That is, Sraffian models were explicitly divorced from empirical reality. And, as is very common in debates, it was much easier to destroy neoclassical theory than to develop a full-scale alternative that can help <b>us</b> <b>understand</b> the world.|$|E
25|$|New advancements in biotechnological {{experimental}} {{methods such as}} the use of Bessel beam plane illumination microscopy and FRET-based sensor molecules can better demonstrate dynamic structures of gap junction plaques. For these experiments, different types of AB5 toxins can be used to induce the fast formation of tCDR in E.Coli cells. The response can then be recorded using cAMP concentration fluctuations in gap junction-coupled cells using FRET-based sensor constructs. Research suggests that CDRs could perhaps be linked with rapid rearrangement of lipids and protein in connexin channels within the gap junction plaques. This can further help <b>us</b> <b>understand</b> the signaling cascade that follows a cellular loss of K+ when exposed to bacterial infection.|$|E

25|$|The {{texts in}} the Version A and Cotton Otho B.xi are {{sufficiently}} similar {{to show that}} ultimately they do derive from one source. The historian David Hill shows how all of the recensions {{can be used to}} correct each other or at least help <b>us</b> <b>understand</b> how errors, especially in the hidage numbers, were mistranscribed in the copying process. Hill argues that these errors are not conflicts of facts or derive from differing lists, but simply errors in copying from a common source; it is possible to see that this was because lines of the text were being missed. However, as noted above, the ‘B’ recensions do not list Burpham, Wareham and Bridport, it is likely that their common archetype must have missed them also. Yet it too must have contained the ‘grand total’ sentence at the end which is flatly contradicted by the hidages enumerated.|$|E

Dr. Welner stated that [...] "These videos do not help <b>us</b> <b>understand</b> Cho. They distort him. He was meek. He was quiet.

She moves on to look at concepts of gender in the Wiccan community, both for men and women and among homosexuals. The third chapter, entitled [...] "The Coven: Perfect Love, Perfect Trust", provides an explanation of the coven system within Wicca, and {{the ways in which}} friendships are built and collapse amongst coven members, and the extent to which covens imitate family structures.|$|E

He urged everyone present to read it, including those in the U.S., remarking that [...] "I think that the first people who should read this book are our brothers and sisters in the United States, because their threat is right in their own house." [...] A vocal anti-imperialist and prominent critic of U.S. foreign policy, particularly in his native Latin America, Chávez went on to describe U.S. President Bush as the [...] "devil" [...] in his speech.|$|E
500|$|Finding the Persian fleet {{gone from}} Samos, the Allies were thrown into uncertainty. Eventually they {{resolved}} {{that they would}} sail to the mainland, and equipped themselves for a naval battle. However, when the Allies approached Mycale, the Persians {{did not attempt to}} engage them, and remained guarding their camp. Leotychides therefore sailed as close to the camp as possible, and had a herald make an appeal to the Ionians: [...] "Men of Ionia, you who hear <b>us,</b> <b>understand</b> what I say, for by no means will the Persians understand anything I charge you with when we join battle; first of all it is right for each man to remember his freedom and next the battle-cry Hebe: and let him who hears me tell him who has not heard it." [...] Herodotus suggests that the purpose of this message was twofold; firstly to encourage the Ionians, unbeknownst to the Persians, to fight for the Allies (or at least not to fight against them); or, if the message became known to the Persians, to make the Persians mistrust the Ionians.|$|E

500|$|Motivated {{by her own}} {{battle to}} gain {{credibility}} as {{a woman in a}} field dominated by male astronomers, [...] Rubin encouraged girls interested in investigating the universe to pursue their dreams. She faced discouraging comments on her choice of study throughout her life, but persevered, supported by family and colleagues. In addition to astronomy, Rubin was a force for greater recognition of women in the sciences and for scientific literacy. She and Burbidge advocated together for more women in the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), on review panels, and in academic searches. She said that despite her struggles with the NAS, she continued to be dissatisfied with the number of women who are elected each year, and called it [...] "the saddest part of [...] life". Rubin was Jewish, and saw no conflict between science and religion. In an interview, she stated: [...] "In my own life, my science and my religion are separate. I'm Jewish, and so religion to me is a kind of moral code and a kind of history. I try to do my science in a moral way, and, I believe that, ideally, science should be looked upon as something that helps <b>us</b> <b>understand</b> our role in the universe." ...|$|E
