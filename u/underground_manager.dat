On 29 April they began blasting a new tunnel, detonating at least six large explosive charges to form the tunnel. The blasts dislodged rock inside the cage of the telehandler, which Webb and Russell attempted to clear, although as the blasts came closer, rock was dislodged faster than they could clear it. Russell recorded the date and time of each blast on his clothing, so that if they died as a result of the blasting, the rescuers would know that they had been alive prior to a particular blast. Both Webb and Russell also wrote letters to their families on their clothing. The two men sang [...] "The Gambler" [...] by Kenny Rogers (the only song they both knew) in order to keep up their spirits, as they waited for successive blasts to occur in the tunnel. At about 5.45PM on 30 April two rescuers, Pat Ball the <b>underground</b> <b>manager</b> and Steve Saltmarsh, mine foreman, breached safety protocols by entering the 925 level, to the rockfall and yelled out. Webb and Russell began yelling [...] "We're in here!" [...] and this was how the rescuers found out they were alive.|$|E

Make this young fellow deputy viewer, with special charge to look after the ventilation. In that way he will not have to give instruction to the men as to their work, but will confine his attention to the ventilation, the state of the air, the doors, and so on. Even then his position will for a time be difficult; but the lad has plenty of self-control, and will be able to tide over it, and the men will get to see that he really understands his business. You will of course order the <b>underground</b> <b>manager</b> and viewers to give him every support. The <b>underground</b> <b>manager,</b> at any rate, must be perfectly aware of his capabilities, as he seems to have done all his paper work for some time." ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse human {{resource}} supply chains and the responsibility of occupational health and safety (OHS) management using Australian evidence from two unrelated research studies in the resources sector. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis is based on additional findings from the research projects using qualitative case study methodologies. The paper draws on interviews with the <b>underground</b> mining <b>manager</b> in study 1 and the OHS manager in study 2, together with current literature on supply chains and OHS responsibility in Australia. Findings: The paper uses examples drawn from two research studies conducted in the resources sector in 2011 to present the notion that there has been a shift in responsibility and management of OHS from the top of the supply chain to the bottom. Research limitations/implications: The paper draws on two unrelated studies that investigated different issues in OHS management. There is a need to undertake specific research to confirm the argument that suggests that the OHS management systems are improving for the bottom of the human resources supply chain in the resources sector. Practical implications: Findings suggest that in the middle tier resources sector the bottom of the human resources supply chains have robust OHS management systems and induction training, contrary to the weakening of OHS management in typical supply chains in other sectors. Originality/value: Unlike manufacturing, healthcare, the public sector and transport, there is little research conducted in the resources sector researching supply chains and OHS management. This paper provides limited evidence of a differing picture in the resources sector than other industries; however, it argues that further studies should be conducted...|$|R

[...] Both Shillito and Radford would be killed in the 1896 disaster. After a further three fatalities in the early 1880s following roof falls, 53-year-old George Mosby was crushed to death by a stone on 6 September 1886. Fellow miner, Samuel Marriott heard his cry, and found him in the goaf, his legs crushed under the stone.

5000|$|The mine's General Manager, an {{accomplice}} in the plot, {{was killed in}} the tunnel collapse. Steyner then interviews Slater, who at this stage is <b>Underground</b> <b>Manager,</b> for the now vacant post of General Manager, although the mine owner / chairman of the board Harry Hirschfeld (Ray Milland) has the next regular man in seniority in mind as another candidate. At this point during his initial interview, Slater first meets Steyner's wife Terry at their luxurious mansion home and is attracted to her, but she does not at first return his interest. However, Steyner arranges for them to meet again, in the hope that Terry will influence her grandfather an old curmudgeon, whom she lovingly calls [...] "Poppsie", the mine owner/ board chairman, in Slater's favour. The plan works, with two consequences: Slater becomes General Manager, and he and Terry start a love affair. Slater, unaware of the criminal plan, agrees to carry out the drilling but is cautious enough to plant a safety charge that will block the tunnel in case of a water leak. Steyner soon finds out that Slater is having an affair with his wife, but allows it to continue because it will keep Slater away from the mine, so that the safety charge can be disabled without his knowledge.|$|E
