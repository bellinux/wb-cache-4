40|$|A {{computer}} program assembles {{images from the}} Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) Mars Observer Camera Narrow Angle (MOCNA) collection to generate a uniform-high-resolution, georeferenced, <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>mosaic</b> image of the Martian surface. At the time of reporting the information for this article, the mosaic covered 7 percent of the Martian surface and contained data from more than 50, 000 source images acquired under various light conditions at various resolutions...|$|E
40|$|An <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>mosaic</b> of {{optically}} correlated Seasat {{radar imagery}} of Florida {{is presented to}} illustrate the data and the large area synoptic coverage made possible by combining multiple data sets. The images were taken from a total of 12 passes over 33 days from July 24, 1978 to August 27, 1978. The mosaic is controlled geometrically and with respect to image tone (representing radar backscatter). The SAR data was obtained at an L-band frequency (1. 275 GHz, 23. 5 cm) and in a horizontal transmit/receive mode, resulting in a 25 m resolution in 100 km swath widths...|$|E
40|$|The Dawn Framing Camera (FC) {{acquired}} {{close to}} 10, 000 clear ﬁlter images of Vesta with {{a resolution of}} about 20 m/pixel during the Low Altitude Mapping Orbit (LAMO) between December 2011 and April 2012. We ortho-rectiﬁed these images and produced a global high-resolution <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>mosaic</b> of Vesta. This global mosaic is the baseline for a high-resolution Vesta atlas that consists of 30 tiles mapped at a scale between 1 : 200, 000 and 1 : 225, 180. The nomenclature used in this atlas was proposed by the Dawn team and {{was approved by the}} International Astronomical Union (IAU). The whole atlas is available to the public through the Dawn GIS web page [[URL]...|$|E
40|$|Preliminary Mariner 9 map {{products}} {{were based on}} computed aerocentric coordinates {{at the point where}} the optic path intercepts a spherical reference figure for Mars. The intercept point on a reference ellipsoid would in general have slightly different values of radius, latitude, and longitude. For near-vertical viewing used for mapping, these differences are on the order of 0. 1 in latitude and longitude, which is negligible compared to the uncertainties of the initial <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>mosaics</b> and maps...|$|R
40|$|An <b>uncontrolled</b> aerial thermographic <b>mosaic</b> of Yellowstone National Park was {{assembled}} {{from the}} videotape record of 13 individual thermographs obtained with linescan radiometers. Post mission processing of the videotape record rectified the nadir line to a topographic map base, corrected for v/h variations in adjacent flight lanes, corrected for {{yaw and pitch}} distortions, and distortions produced by nonlinearity of the side-wise scan. One {{of the purposes of}} the thermographic study was to delineate the areas of thermal emission (hot springs, geysers, etc.) throughout the Park, a study which could have great value in reconnaissance surveys of geothermal areas in remote regions or regions of high relief...|$|R
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. <b>Uncontrolled</b> photo <b>mosaics</b> of ERTS- 1 imagery using MSS band 5 and 7 at {{a scale of}} 1 : 1, 000, 000 were {{used to make a}} preliminary surficial geology map in northcentral Alaska. Seven distinct geologic units were recognized, defined, and mapped directly on a photo mosaic. Results are closely correlated with published surficial geology maps. Eight MSS images were examined to test utility of ERTS data in studies of coastal processes and stream hydrology, and in the identification and interpretation of geomorphic features throughout Alaska. The feasibility of using ERTS- 1 data to map structural lineaments is well illustrated on a mosaic of 8, band 5 MSS images. Along the northern edge of the Brooks Range one lineament can be followed the entire width of the mosaic, a distance of 225 miles. Two nearly parallel lineaments can be seen running along the northern and southern edges of the Schwatka Mountains. About 135 miles south of these two lineaments another series located in the Chitanana River region can be followed for 45 miles. These lineaments appear to be faults, and {{it is interesting to note}} that the Yukon River parallels these and appears to be structurally controlled...|$|R
40|$|The OnMars server is a {{computer}} program that provides Internet access to high-resolution Mars images, maps, and elevation data, all suitable for use in geographical information system (GIS) software for generating images, maps, and computational models of Mars. The OnMars server is an implementation of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Web Map Service (WMS) server. Unlike other Mars Internet map servers that provide Martian data using an Earth coordinate system, the OnMars WMS server supports encoding of data in Mars-specific coordinate systems. The OnMars server offers access {{to most of the}} available high-resolution Martian image and elevation data, including an 8 -meter-per-pixel <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>mosaic</b> of most of the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) Mars Observer Camera Narrow Angle (MOCNA) image collection, which is not available elsewhere. This server can generate image and map files in the tagged image file format (TIFF), Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG), 8 - or 16 -bit Portable Network Graphics (PNG), or Keyhole Markup Language (KML) format. Image control is provided by use of the OGC Style Layer Descriptor (SLD) protocol. The OnMars server also implements tiled WMS protocol and super-overlay KML for high-performance client application programs...|$|E
40|$|In 1991 a need arose to {{establish}} land use changes, {{which took place}} in Machakos District, Kenya during the past five decades. The study, among others, included environmental, population, conservation, farming systems, and production changes and trends. A GIS was designed mainly {{to assess the impact of}} land terracing on the reduction of soil erosion and agriculture productivity. The available material was aerial photographs dated 1948, 1960, 1978 of varying scales and qualities. Selected sites at different locations were identified, and map bases were established from available topographic maps. Stereoscopic interpretation of the aerial photographs covering the selected areas was conducted to delineate the boundaries of the chosen land categories. A set of three temporal <b>uncontrolled</b> aerial <b>mosaics</b> for each area was assembled, one from the interpreted aerial photographs of each date. A half-tone negative was produced for each mosaic. The negative was re-projected to form positive transparency of appropriate scale conforming with the map base. The areas of the various categories were measured and the temporal changes in land use were defined by comparing transparencies of different epoch. By this method it was possible to obtain quick information with reasonable accuracy and cost to meet the set objectives. The exercise had clearly demonstrated that, in the absence of recent computer technologies, it was still possible to use the available material and facilities to produce and provide useful information to satisfactorily meet certain objectives. However, for sustainable development, there should be awareness of the direction of the development in the country, and identification of the suitable technologies to meet its needs. It is, therefore, recommended to acquire suitable computer based GIS paralleled with appropriate training and follow up. The expansion of the educational base in this field is of prime importance...|$|R
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. A comparison of photomorphic regions from an <b>uncontrolled</b> ERTS- 1 <b>mosaic</b> of CARETS to land use areas {{on a map}} published in the National Atlas revealed close correlations in non-urban regions. Such regional scale analysis of ERTS- 1 data {{has the potential for}} providing an economical sampling strategy for selecting sites for more detailed field measurements if other environmental variables can be correlated with patterns on ERTS- 1 imagery. ERTS- 1 imagery has also revealed {{for the first time the}} appearance of CARETS during the winter months. Investigators have identified extensive areas of conifers, which have previously been indistinguishable from deciduous vegetation. Imagery has also shown very clearly the extent of snow cover at a particular time over the region. The evaluation of ERTS- 1 imagery used for the land use mapping of the shore zone of CARETS, has shown that the presence or absence of elements of an hierarchal system of shoreline landforms can help identify areas of potential rapid change. Changes in land use class distributions on the Barrier Islands signify the environmental response to natural and man-caused processes. Both environmental vulnerability and sensitivity can be estimated from the repetitive ERTS- 1 coverage of long reaches of the CARETS coast. Results indicate potential applications to land use planning, management, and regional environmental quality analysis...|$|R
