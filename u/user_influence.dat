40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{understand}} how social welfare secretaries within income support relate to <b>user</b> <b>influence.</b> We evaluated how to implement <b>user</b> <b>influence</b> within systems like income support. We based this study on the experiences of social welfare secretaries with regards to <b>user</b> <b>influence</b> and which possibilities and constraints they believe exist within the implementation of <b>user</b> <b>influence.</b> We chose to use a qualitative method with a hermeneutic approach and interviewed eight social welfare secretaries within the field of income support. The empirical material was interpreted by using Michel Lipsky's theory on Street-level bureaucracy and Michel Foucault's definition of power/knowledge and governmentality. The study came to show that the term <b>user</b> <b>influence</b> does not have one single definition, but several and provides possibilities for interpretation. The implementation of the concept of <b>user</b> <b>influence</b> depends on how it is being interpreted by the social welfare secretaries. Furthermore, within the field of income support there is a limited space for the users to have influence, but it is important to preserve that limited space. The outcome shows that <b>user</b> <b>influence</b> within income support is limited by the space for action and resources of the secretaries and organizations. Since income support is based on an individual assessment it is also of importance that <b>user</b> <b>influence</b> should be treated on an individual basis...|$|E

I studien ges en bakgrund till Sveriges narkotikapolitik och hur dess utvecklingen har sett ut från 70 - talet fram till idag. I bakgrunden till studien presenteras ett governace-perspektiv på brukarinflytande och de deliberativa {{processer}} där brukarinflytande är en naturlig del av policyprocessen. Syftet med studien är undersöka förekomsten av brukarinflytande i implementeringsdelen av den besluts- policyprocess som ledde fram till sprututbytets öppnande i april 2013. Studiens teoretisk ramverk består av teorier som ifrågasätter givenheten i governance-synsättet på brukarinflytande genom hänvisning till svårigheter med aktörskap och risken med konstruerat brukarinflytande. Forskningsstrategin som studien utgår ifrån är intervjuer med utvalda respondenter som har varit delaktiga vid implementeringen av sprututbytet samt brukarorganisationer som representerar och företräder sprututbytets målgrupp. Resultatet av studien visar på en svag förekomst av brukarinflytande vid implementeringen av sprututbytet. Det brukarinflytande som kan anses har förekommit har varit på en individuell nivå och icke-formaliserat. I analysen presenteras tre möjlig förklaringar till den svaga förekomsten av brukarinflytande vid implementeringen av sprututbytet samt en analys om svårigheter med aktörskap vid implementeringen kopplat till studiens teoretiska ramverk. This {{study examines}} {{the occurrence of}} <b>user</b> <b>influence</b> during {{the implementation of the}} first Needle and Syringe exchange Programme (NSP) in Stockholm County. The survey in his study consists of interviews conducted with persons that have been involved during the process and debate around the NSP in Stockholm County. The interviews have been conducted with two different groups of actors: User organizations and public actors. The first group called user organizations consists of actors from three different user organizations representing and organizing the target group for the NSP. The second group called public actors consists of public actors which have been involved under and/or before the implementation of the NSP in Stockholm County. The study contains a description of the background of NSPs in Sweden. The study describes the development of the Swedish drug policy from 1970 until today. Further it covers the development of the NSPs in other parts of Sweden as well as the development of harm reduction as a general strategy for drug addiction management. Several definitions to the terms user and <b>user</b> <b>influence</b> are presented. Four are conventional definitions of the term user, together with a fifth one which is then used within {{in the context of the}} study. The study presents definitions of the term <b>user</b> <b>influence</b> by a model dividing <b>user</b> <b>influence</b> in three categories: individual level, operational level and system level. Another division of the term <b>user</b> <b>influence</b> presented is formalized and non-formalized <b>user</b> <b>influence.</b> These different classifications are used in the analysis of the results. The study also presents a background to the governance view on <b>user</b> <b>influence</b> as a natural and unproblematic part in the policy process. The theoretical framework in the study consists of two parts: The first part questions governance and the given of <b>user</b> <b>influence</b> within a policy process. The study highlights the problems with a governance view on actorhood and <b>user</b> <b>influence.</b> The second part of the theory chapter presents a model for the policy process. The policy process is described in five stages: Initiation, processing, decision making, implementation and evaluation. The results of the survey show little occurrence of <b>user</b> <b>influence</b> during the implementation of the NSP. By using the classification with the three different levels of <b>user</b> <b>influence</b> the result is that the occurrence of <b>user</b> <b>influence</b> found in the investigation has the characteristics of individual level <b>user</b> <b>influence.</b> The study also shows that the <b>user</b> <b>influence</b> found can be classified as non-formalised influence. The analysis first discusses the factors of why there has been little occurrence of <b>user</b> <b>influence</b> during the implementation of the NSP and proposes three different plausible explanations: Politically sensitive question, structural difficulties and users view was already known. The analysis also discuss the problem with a governance view on actorhood and <b>user</b> <b>influence</b> in relation to the study. The study concludes that there has been little occurrence of <b>user</b> <b>influence</b> during the implementation of the NSP in Stockholm County and that the occurrence of <b>user</b> <b>influence</b> found can be classified as individual level <b>user</b> <b>influence,</b> with one plausible exception...|$|E

Therefore the <b>user</b> <b>influence</b> in social media, such as Twitter, is widely studied based on different standards, such as the number of followers, retweets and so on. However, little work considers the accurate click number of short URLs as the measurement of influence. In Twitter short URLs are frequently included in tweets because of the limitation of characters. And some users may focus more on click number of the URLs instead of the number of followers or retweets. Thus, it is necessary to analyze the factors that impact the click number received by URLs of users. In this paper, we conduct the predictive analyses about the <b>user</b> <b>influence</b> which is measured by the click number of short URLs. We first exploit a wide range of possible features consisting of the sets of user properties, behavior and topics.

Based on interviews with representatives from controlled vocabularies and LibraryThing users who tag transgender-themed material, existing attitudes towards <b>user</b> <b>influence</b> in controlled vocabularies are described and the significance of tagging for transgender-themed material is looked into. With queer theory and postcolonial theory as its main framework the analysis looks at what possibilities there are for users to influence controlled vocabularies and explores possible strategies for a future library catalog that includes the voice of the Other. The study lands in {{the understanding that}} many of the resisting attitudes towards <b>user</b> <b>influence</b> within the systems for subject headings in fact lie in the systems’ limitations. The conclusion is made that the concept of connected knowledge could be a possible way to integrate Others in the shaping of subject headings. Opening controlled vocabularies to <b>user</b> <b>influence</b> does not automatically break down hegemonic structures or include all voices, nor does it make indexing predictable.
