5|$|<b>Ursa</b> <b>Minor</b> is {{bordered by}} Camelopardalis to the west, Draco to the west, and Cepheus to the east. Covering 256square degrees, it ranks 56th of the 88 constellations in size. <b>Ursa</b> <b>Minor</b> is colloquially {{known in the}} US as the Little Dipper because its seven {{brightest}} stars seem to form {{the shape of a}} dipper (ladle or scoop). The star {{at the end of the}} dipper handle is Polaris. Polaris can also be found by following a line through the two stars—Alpha and Beta Ursae Majoris—that form the end of the 'bowl' of the Big Dipper, for 30 degrees (three upright fists at arms' length) across the night sky. The four stars constituting the bowl of the Little Dipper are of second, third, fourth, and fifth magnitudes, and provide an easy guide to determining what magnitude stars are visible, useful for city dwellers or testing one's eyesight.|$|E

50|$|According to David Gordon White, the {{original}} Shunahshepa myth alluded to in Rigveda (in passages attributed to Shunahshepa) {{may have been}} an astronomical explanation {{for the fact that the}} three stars in the <b>Ursa</b> <b>Minor's</b> tail never fall below the line of horizon. However, its variants in Aitareya Brahmana and Sankhyana Srauta Sutra are an origin myth for the outcasts, who are described as the descendants of Vishvamitra's disobedient sons.|$|R
40|$|Services {{that share}} a storage system should realize the same efficiency, within {{their share of}} time, as when they have it to themselves. This {{technical}} report describes mechanisms for mitigating the inefficiency arising from inter-service disk and cache interference in traditional systems and their realization in <b>Ursa</b> <b>Minor’s</b> storage server, Argon. Argon uses multi-MB prefetching and writeback to insulate sequential stream efficiency from the disk seeks introduced by competing workloads. It explicitly partitions the cache capacity among services to insulate the hit rate each enjoys from the access patterns of others. Experiments show that, combined, these mechanisms allow Argon to provide to each client a configurable fraction (e. g., 0. 9) of its standalone efficiency. With fair-share scheduling, each of n clients approaches the ideal of 1 /n of its standalone throughput.

2500|$|According to Ovid, it was Jupiter (Zeus) {{who took}} the form of Diana (Artemis) so that he might evade his wife Juno’s detection, forcing himself upon Callisto while she was {{separated}} from Diana and the other nymphs. Callisto's subsequent pregnancy was discovered several months later while she was bathing with Diana and her fellow nymphs. Diana became enraged when she saw that Callisto was pregnant and expelled her from the group. [...] Callisto later gave birth to Arcas. Juno then took the opportunity to avenge her wounded pride and transformed the nymph into a bear. Sixteen years later Callisto, still a bear, encountered her son Arcas hunting in the forest. Just as Arcas was about to kill his own mother with his javelin, Jupiter averted the tragedy by placing mother and son amongst the stars as <b>Ursa</b> Major and <b>Minor,</b> respectively. Juno, enraged that her attempt at revenge had been frustrated, appealed to Tethys that the two might never meet her waters, thus providing a poetic explanation for their circumpolar positions in ancient times (see below).|$|R

25|$|<b>Ursa</b> <b>Minor</b> is not {{the only}} {{constellation}} that does not look very much like what it represents; very few do. This has led to nicknames for some of the constellations. These nicknames are another variety of asterism. A glance at the stick-figures shown in the charts under the constellation names will easily explain the origin of these asterisms.|$|E
25|$|Enraged, Hera or Artemis (some {{accounts}} say both) {{changed her}} into a bear. Arcas almost killed the bear, but Zeus stopped him just in time. Out of pity, Zeus placed Callisto the bear into the heavens, thus the origin of Callisto the Bear as a constellation. Some stories say that he placed both Arcas and Callisto into the heavens as bears, forming the <b>Ursa</b> <b>Minor</b> and Ursa Major constellations.|$|E

25|$|The {{stars of}} Ursa Major were all {{circumpolar}} in Athens of 400 BCE, {{and all but}} {{the stars in the}} Great Bear's left foot were circumpolar in Ovid's Rome, in the first century CE. Now, however, due to the precession of the equinoxes, the feet of the Great Bear constellation do sink below the horizon from Rome and especially from Athens; however, <b>Ursa</b> <b>Minor</b> (Arcas) does remain completely above the horizon, even from latitudes as far south as Honolulu and Hong Kong.|$|E
25|$|Moderns have Polaris to {{mark the}} {{approximate}} location of the North celestial pole, which it does nearly exactly, but this position of Polaris was not available in Pytheas' time, due {{to changes in the}} positions of the stars. Pytheas reported that the pole was an empty space at the corner of a quadrangle, the other three sides of which were marked by stars. Their identity has not survived but based on calculations these are believed to have been α and κ in Draco and β in <b>Ursa</b> <b>Minor.</b>|$|E
25|$|By {{the third}} century BC the Greeks had begun to use the Little Bear, <b>Ursa</b> <b>Minor,</b> to navigate. In the mid-1st century AD Lucan writes of Pompey who {{questions}} a sailor {{about the use of}} stars in navigation. The sailor replies with his description of the use of circumpolar stars to navigate by. To navigate along a degree of latitude a sailor would have needed to find a circumpolar star above that degree in the sky. For example, Apollonius would have used β Draconis to navigate as he traveled west {{from the mouth of the}} Alpheus River to Syracuse.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} the Phenomena is to give an {{introduction}} to the constellations, with the rules for their risings and settings; and of the circles of the sphere, amongst which the Milky Way is reckoned. The positions of the constellations, north of the ecliptic, are described by reference to the principal groups surrounding the north pole (Ursa Major, <b>Ursa</b> <b>Minor,</b> Draco, and Cepheus), whilst Orion serves as a point of departure for those to the south. The immobility of the earth, and the revolution of the sky about a fixed axis are maintained; the path of the sun in the zodiac is described; but the planets are introduced merely as bodies having a motion of their own, without any attempt to define their periods; nor is anything said about the moon's orbit. The opening of the poem asserts the dependence of all things upon Zeus. From the lack of precision in the descriptions, it would seem that Aratus was neither a mathematician nor observer or, at any rate, that in this work he did not aim at scientific accuracy. He not only represents the configurations of particular groups incorrectly, but describes some phenomena which are inconsistent with any one supposed latitude of the spectator, and others which could not coexist at any one epoch. These errors are partly to be attributed to Eudoxus himself, and partly {{to the way in which}} Aratus has used the materials supplied by him. Hipparchus (about a century later), who was a scientific astronomer and observer, has left a commentary upon the Phenomenas of Eudoxus and Aratus, accompanied by the discrepancies which he had noticed between his own observations and their descriptions.|$|E

500|$|<b>Ursa</b> <b>Minor</b> {{is rather}} devoid of deep-sky objects. The <b>Ursa</b> <b>Minor</b> Dwarf, a dwarf {{spheroidal}} galaxy, {{was discovered by}} Albert George Wilson of the Lowell Observatory in the Palomar Sky Survey in 1955. Its centre is around [...] light-years distant from Earth. In 1999, Kenneth Mighell and Christopher Burke used the Hubble Space Telescope to confirm {{that it had a}} single burst of star formation that lasted around 2 billion years that took place around 14 billion years ago, and that the galaxy was probably as old as the Milky Way itself.|$|E
500|$|The {{origin of}} this name is unclear (<b>Ursa</b> <b>Minor</b> being a [...] "dog's tail" [...] would imply that another {{constellation}} nearby is [...] "the dog", but no such constellation is known).|$|E
500|$|<b>Ursa</b> <b>Minor</b> (Latin: [...] "Lesser Bear", {{contrasting}} with Ursa Major), {{also known}} as the Little Bear, is a constellation in the Northern Sky. Like the Great Bear, the tail of the Little Bear may also be seen as the handle of a ladle, hence the North American name, Little Dipper: seven stars with four in its bowl like its partner the Big Dipper. It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. <b>Ursa</b> <b>Minor</b> has traditionally been important for navigation, particularly by mariners, because of Polaris being the North Star.|$|E
500|$|In the Babylonian star catalogues, <b>Ursa</b> <b>Minor</b> {{was known}} as the [...] "Wagon of Heaven" [...] ( [...] , also {{associated}} with the goddess Damkina). It is listed in the MUL.APIN catalogue, compiled around 1000BC among the [...] "Stars of Enlil"—that is, the northern sky.|$|E
500|$|According to Diogenes Laertius, citing Callimachus, Thales of Miletus [...] "measured {{the stars}} of the Wagon by which the Phoenicians sail". Diogenes {{identifies}} these as the constellation of <b>Ursa</b> <b>Minor,</b> which for its reported use by the Phoenicians for navigation at sea were also named Phoinikē.|$|E
500|$|Because <b>Ursa</b> <b>Minor</b> {{consists}} of seven stars, the Latin word for [...] "north" [...] (i.e., where Polaris points) is septentrio, from septem (seven) and [...] (oxen), from seven oxen driving a plough, which the seven stars also resemble. This name {{has also been}} attached to the main stars of Ursa Major.|$|E
500|$|Others have {{suggested}} that an archaic interpretation of Ursa Major {{was that of a}} Cow, forming a group with Bootes as herdsman, and <b>Ursa</b> <b>Minor</b> as a dog. George William Cox [...] explained it as a variant of Λυκόσουρα, understood as [...] "wolf's tail" [...] but by him etymologized as [...] "trail, or train, of light" [...] (i.e. [...] "wolf" [...] vs. [...] "light"). Allen points to the Old Irish name of the constellation, drag-blod [...] "fire trail", for comparison.|$|E
500|$|The constellations of Ursa Major and <b>Ursa</b> <b>Minor,</b> {{the great}} and little bears, are named for their {{supposed}} resemblance to bears, {{from the time of}} Ptolemy. The nearby star Arcturus means [...] "guardian of the bear", as if it were watching the two constellations. Ursa Major has been associated with a bear for as much as 13,000 years since Paleolithic times, in the widespread Cosmic Hunt myths. These are found {{on both sides of the}} Bering land bridge, which was lost to the sea some 11,000 years ago.|$|E
500|$|In {{the entire}} corpus of Roman {{literature}} and historiography, Yule {{was unable to}} uncover any other mention of such a direct diplomatic encounter between the Romans and the Seres. He speculated {{that these people were}} more likely to have been private merchants than diplomats, since Chinese records insist that Gan Ying was the first Chinese to reach as far west as Tiaozhi ( [...] ; Mesopotamia) in 97 AD. Yule notes that the 1st-century AD Periplus mentioned that people of Thinae (Sinae) were rarely seen, because of the difficulties of reaching that country. It states that their country, located under <b>Ursa</b> <b>Minor</b> and on the farthest unknown reaches of the Caspian Sea, was the origin of raw silk and fine silk cloth that was traded overland from Bactria to Barygaza, as well as down the Ganges.|$|E
500|$|In the Old Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, {{the goddess}} Ishtar sends Taurus, the Bull of Heaven, to kill Gilgamesh for spurning her advances. Enkidu tears off the bull's hind part and hurls the {{quarters}} {{into the sky}} where they become the stars we know as Ursa Major and <b>Ursa</b> <b>Minor.</b> Some locate Gilgamesh as the neighboring constellation of Orion, facing Taurus as if in combat, while others identify him with the sun whose rising on the equinox vanquishes the constellation. In early Mesopotamian art, the Bull of Heaven was closely associated with Inanna, the Sumerian goddess of sexual love, fertility, and warfare. One of the oldest depictions shows the bull standing before the goddess' standard; since it has 3 stars depicted on its back (the cuneiform sign for [...] "star-constellation"), {{there is good reason}} to regard this as the constellation later known as Taurus.|$|E
500|$|Taken {{from the}} villain in The Magnificent Seven, Calvera is the {{nickname}} given to an X-ray source known as 1RXS J141256.0+792204 in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey Bright Source Catalog (RASS/BSC). It {{has been identified}} as an isolated neutron star, one of the closest of its kind to Earth. <b>Ursa</b> <b>Minor</b> has two enigmatic white dwarfs. H1504+65 is a faint (magnitude 15.9) star that with the hottest surface temperature—200,000 K—yet discovered for a white dwarf. Its atmosphere, composed of roughly half carbon, half oxygen and 2% neon, is devoid of hydrogen and helium—its composition unexplainable by current models of stellar evolution. WD 1337+705 is a cooler white dwarf that has magnesium and silicon in its spectrum, suggesting a companion or circumstellar disk, though no evidence for either has come to light. WISE 1506+7027 is a brown dwarf of spectral type T6 that is a mere [...] light-years away from Earth. A faint object of magnitude 14, it was discovered by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) in 2011.|$|E
500|$|The {{pattern of}} the {{brightest}} stars resembles that of <b>Ursa</b> <b>Minor,</b> in that the stars form a pattern reminiscent of a bowl with a handle. Lying south-southeast of Acrux in neighbouring Crux is Alpha Muscae. It is {{the brightest star in}} the constellation with an apparent magnitude of 2.7. Lying around 310 light-years away, it is a blue-white star of spectral type B2IV-V that is around 4520 times as luminous and 8 times as massive as the Sun. The star is a Beta Cephei variable with about 4.7 times the Sun's diameter, and pulsates every 2.2hours, varying by 1% in brightness.
