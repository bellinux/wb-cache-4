5000|$|Shop At Home (SATH (Shop At The Home) stock symbol) {{the concept}} was started by Joe Overholt in the middle 1980s. Located in a strip mall just off of Interstate 40 in Newport Tn the {{original}} programs were taped in segments and mailed to head-end origination studios to be played when time was available. The low budget production was aired over <b>unused</b> <b>satellite</b> transponders to an audience that of individual satellite dish owners. It soon became apparent that these inconsistent excursions would not a shopping channel make. After pulling together some very limited funding from a few local East Tennessee small business men and individuals around Knoxville SAH began the search for affordable satellite distribution time. Plans were being made to take the company public and without securing a means of distribution it would fail. An [...] "available for the right price" [...] transponder was located and an affiliate (and friend) of Overholts entered into negotiations and after much legal and financial wrangling this most important asset was acquired.|$|E
30|$|A solar {{reflector}} {{was designed}} through the repurposing of <b>unused</b> <b>satellite</b> dishes into a reflective parabolic mirror {{that will serve}} as the sole heat source to drive synthetic chemical reactions to completion [17]. To transform the satellite dishes into solar reflectors, the surface of the dish was completely covered with Metalized Mylar® tape to attain the reflective properties needed to generate heat. It was discovered that the feed horn of the satellite dish is located at the focal point. Therefore, the feed horn of the dish was removed and reaction flasks were placed in this position in order to achieve maximum intensity from the directed sunlight.|$|E
40|$|Our {{development}} {{team would}} like to utilize an unused resource of reflected satellite signals to monitor traffic congestion. Traffic plagues the nation’s roadways, and by developing a receiver that would be located above highways and will monitor the reflected signals, we plan to lessen this roadway congestion. The satellite signal we propose to use is from a geostationary satellite. The fact that <b>unused</b> <b>satellites</b> signals are being used for this design resource may significantly reduce our cost with respect to currently used systems. To accomplish this, we plan to use the satellite signals that are reflected off objects located on the earth’s surface. In {{the case of this}} design project, our objects would be automobiles located on a highway. When the highway is crowded with automobiles, the reflected signal will be significantly increased in magnitude compared to when the highway has light or no traffic. This device may be implemented nationwide, since geostationary satellites broadcast their signal all over the United States. The information that it will provide can be displayed via the internet, or ideally GPS devices located in automobiles. Based on this information, travelers may find alternate route...|$|R

Most seriously, it was proposed for use as part of a robotic servicing mission for the Hubble Space Telescope, before the final Shuttle servicing mission was approved. The ICM has also been suggested {{as an integral part of}} a new telescope based on <b>unused</b> spy <b>satellite</b> hardware, and even for use in its original role in the event of removal of the Russian Orbital Segment of the ISS.|$|R

The company {{was the first to}} {{petition}} the FCC to assign <b>unused</b> frequencies for <b>satellite</b> radio broadcast, which “provoked a furor among owners of both large and small [...] radio stations.” Rothblatt had previously helped create the PanAmSat international satellite television system, and helped launch and served as CEO of the Geostar satellite navigation system. In April 1992, she resigned as chairman and CEO of Sirius in order to start a medical research foundation, focused on finding a cure for her daughter's illness. Former NASA engineer Robert Briskman, who designed the company's satellite technology, was then appointed Chairman and CEO.|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} a renewed {{interest}} at the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in using Less-than-Best Effort (LBE) methods for background applications. IETF recently published a RFC for Low Extra Delay Background Transport (LEDBAT), a congestion control algorithm for LBE transmissions. This paper provides an analysis of LEDBAT performance over congested large bandwidth X delay product (LBDP) networks, and assesses the validity of having a fixed target queuing time. In particular, we lead {{a study of the}} impact of this target queuing delay when LEDBAT is used over 4 G satellite networks. The rationale is to explore the possibility to grab the <b>unused</b> 4 G <b>satellite</b> links' capacity to carry non-commercial traffic. We show that this is achievable with LEDBAT. However, depending on the fluctuation of the load, performance improvements could be obtained by properly setting the target value. We generalize this evaluation over different congested LBDP networks and confirm that the target value might need to be adjusted to networks' and traffic's characteristics. Further work will study whether and how this parameter should be dynamically adapted, and LEDBAT's congestion control improved. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Small {{satellite}} missions requiring {{attitude control}} can realize significant mass savings by extending the moment {{arm of a}} propulsion-based system. Replacing traditional torque rods and reaction wheels with small thrusters on extendable booms can significantly reduce {{the mass of the}} ACS. Small satellite buses pose significant integration challenges when incorporating electric micro-thrusters. Generally these satellites have low power capability and small geometries. This impacts attitude determination and control system (ADACS) thruster performance significantly, as it results in low thrust capability (due to power limitations) and small torque moment arms (due to size limitations). To address these technical challenges, the Air Force Research Laboratory is developing a lightweight deployable boom for extending the moment arm of Busek Inc. ’s Micro-Propulsion Attitude Control System (MPACS). Specific engineering requirements include increased stiffness, integrated power, and a telemetry wiring harness embedded within the boom’s multi-functional structure. A major design goal is to standardize a modular integration with satellites using the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) Secondary Payload Adapter (ESPA). Therefore, the boom is designed to stow within the ESPA interface port, a surface region that is generally <b>unused</b> on ESPA <b>satellites.</b> Deployment of the boom is accomplished with a series of elastic-memory composite (EMC) hinges that extend a multi-functional composite structure to a total length of 4 meters. Gravity-gradient stabilization for tip and roll control is abetted by a 6. 2 -kg tip mass, comprised of the MPAC...|$|R

The company {{was the first to}} {{petition}} the FCC to assign <b>unused</b> frequencies for <b>satellite</b> radio broadcast, which [...] "provoked a furor among owners of both large and small terrestrial radio stations." [...] In April 1992, Rothblatt resigned as chairman and CEO to start a medical research foundation. Former NASA engineer Briskman, who designed the company's satellite technology, was then appointed chairman and CEO. Six months later, in November 1992, Rogers Wireless co-founder Margolese, who had provided financial backing for the venture, acquired control of the company and succeeded Briskman. Margolese renamed the company CD Radio, and spent the next five years lobbying the FCC to allow satellite radio to be deployed, and the following five years raising $1.6 billion, which was used to build and launch three satellites into elliptical orbit from Kazakhstan in July 2000. In 1997, after Margolese had obtained regulatory clearance and [...] "effectively created the industry," [...] the FCC also sold a license to XM Satellite Radio, which followed Sirius' example. In November 1999, marketing chief Ira Bahr convinced Margolese to again change the name of the company, this time to Sirius Satellite Radio, in order to avoid association with the soon-to-be-outdated CD technology. Having secured installation deals with automakers, including BMW, Chrysler and Ford, Sirius launched the initial phase of its service in four cities on February 14, 2002, expanding {{to the rest of the}} contiguous United States on July 1, 2002.|$|R
