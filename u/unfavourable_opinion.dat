A problem of the adaptation of Skarga’s texts is also taken into account. Authors intercepted especially excerpts of Kazania sejmowe. The article takes under consideration description of the historical background. Dramas which are subject of the article met with <b>unfavourable</b> <b>opinions</b> of historians of literature. They accused dramas, that aren’t growing beyond the level of “occasional works”, which are marked by a schematism and a naivety. However, these charges weren’t confirmed with any analysis.

60|$|Many years {{afterwards}} Almayer {{was telling}} the story of the great revolution in Sambir to a chance visitor from Europe. He was a Roumanian, half naturalist, half orchid-hunter for commercial purposes, who used to declare to everybody, in the first five minutes of acquaintance, his intention of writing a scientific book about tropical countries. On his way to the interior he had quartered himself upon Almayer. He was a man of some education, but he drank his gin neat, or only, at most, would squeeze the juice of half a small lime into the raw spirit. He said it was good for his health, and, with that medicine before him, he would describe to the surprised Almayer the wonders of European capitals; while Almayer, in exchange, bored him by expounding, with gusto, his <b>unfavourable</b> <b>opinions</b> of Sambir's social and political life.

So the study was carried to assess the knowledge, attitude and practice of EC among engineering college girls. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in an engineering college. All girls from a field {{were included in the}} study. Data was collected by a predesigned, pre-tested, self-administered multiple response questionnaires. Results: A total of 8 (5. 7 %) reported that they had previously used ECPs. An association was found between users and their level of knowledge. Users had Average/Good knowledge as compared to non–users (OR- 12. 51). A strong association was found between source of information and level of knowledge. In other words, respondent receiving information from the Health Personnel (OR 21. 49) and Audio-Visual Media (OR 10. 2) {{were more likely to have}} good or average knowledge as compared to family and friends (OR 6). Conclusion: Knowledge of emergency contraception by students is low and the method is still underused. Strategies to promote use of emergency contraception should be focused on spreading accurate information through medical sources, which have been found to be reliable and associated with good knowledge on emergency contraception...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} part of information-gathering behaviour {{has always been to}} find out what other people think and whether they have favourable (positive) or <b>unfavourable</b> (negative) <b>opinions</b> about the subject. This survey studies the role of negation in an opinion-oriented information-seeking system. We investigate the problem of determining the polarity of sentiments in movie reviews when negation words, such as not and hardly occur in the sentences. We examine how different negation scopes (window sizes) affect the classification accuracy. We used term frequencies to evaluate the discrimination capacity of our system with different window sizes. The results show that there is no significant difference in classification accuracy when different window sizes have been applied. However, negation detection helped to identify more opinion or sentiment carrying expressions. We conclude that traditional negation detection methods are inadequate for the task of sentiment analysis in this domain and that progress is to be made by exploiting information about how opinions are expressed implicitly...|$|R
50|$|Part I {{opens with}} Christine reading from Matheolus’s Lamentations, a {{work from the}} thirteenth century that {{addresses}} marriage wherein the author writes that women make men’s lives miserable. Upon reading these words, Christine becomes upset and feels ashamed to be a woman: “This thought inspired such {{a great sense of}} disgust and sadness in me that I began to despise myself and the whole of my sex as an aberration in nature”. The three Virtues then appear to Christine, and each lady tells Christine what her role will be in helping her build the City of Ladies. Lady Reason, a virtue developed by Christine for the purpose of her book, is the first to join Christine and helps her build the external walls of the city. She answers Christine's questions about why some men slander women, helping Christine to prepare the ground on which the city will be built. She tells Christine to “take the spade of her intelligence and dig deep to make a trench all around city … Reason will help to carry away the hods of earth on her shoulders.” These “hods of earth” are the past beliefs Christine has held. Christine, {{in the beginning of the}} text, believed that women must truly be bad because she “could scarcely find a moral work by any author which didn't devote some chapter or paragraph to attacking the female sex. she had to accept authors <b>unfavourable</b> <b>opinions</b> of women since it was unlikely that so many learned men, who seemed to be endowed with such great intelligence and insight into all things, could possibly have lied on so many different occasions.” Christine is not using reason to discover the merits of women. She believes all that she reads instead of putting her mind to listing all the great deeds women have accomplished. To help Christine see reason, Lady Reason comes and teaches Christine. She helps Christine dispel her own self-consciousness and the negative thoughts of past writers. By creating Lady Reason, Christine not only teaches her own allegorical self, but also her readers. She gives not only herself reason, but also gives readers, and women, reason to believe that women are not evil or useless creatures but instead have a significant place within society.|$|R

But it must be answered, that, in letters containing elsewhere (though not immediately in connexion with these statements) <b>opinions</b> <b>unfavourable</b> to the Spaniards, to omit any thing making for them--is to misrepresent in effect.

40|$|The third {{sphere of}} {{government}} (Local Government) has been persistently clouded by unfavourable Annual Financial Statement (AFS) audit reports. This results in local government losing credibility and its stakeholders losing {{confidence in the}} institutions or municipalities. In-depth analysis of {{the root cause of}} this dilemma is an opportunity for the municipality to reorganise its house and redeem its dignity and credibility to its stakeholders through addressing the identified challenges. The importance of the study {{can be attributed to the}} need to investigate the root causes of <b>unfavourable</b> audit <b>opinion</b> and recommend possible remedies that can assist municipalities to improve their audit report outcomes which in turn will improve the confidence of its stakeholders. The primary objective of the study was to investigate variables that impact on the audit report outcomes on annual financial statements of the municipalities that are within Alfred Nzo District (AND) Jurisdiction, including Alfred Nzo District Municipality (ANDM). This was achieved through investigating the root causes of the audit report outcomes with specific focus on the relationship that exists between the management role and audit outcomes of the Alfred Nzo District Municipalities. This was measured by the municipality’s leadership, governance, internal controls and human capital management. Convenient sampling was used wherein 150 questionnaires (30 per municipality) were sent out to the selected employees in all the municipalities in the Alfred Nzo District. Out of the questionnaires that were sent out, 103 responses were received. These were analysed to draw findings, conclusion and recommendations. The empirical results of the study revealed that there is strong evidence that leadership, governance and human capital management have a positive influence on the municipality’s AFS audit report outcomes. It also revealed that there is overwhelming evidence that internal controls have a positive influence on the municipality’s AFS audit report outcomes. The study recommends how leadership, governance, internal controls and human capital management must be improved. It also provides future research recommendations to improve this study...|$|R

40|$|International audienceOrpheus, sorcerer or magus? “Orpheus {{the magician}} in the pagan {{tradition}} {{at the beginning}} of our Era” The description of Orpheus as a "magician" was pejorative in the classical time and also in the texts which reflect the spirit of this period. However, when associated with the mention of his Thracian, and hence Barbarian origin, in some texts of the second century A. D onwards, the same criticism seems to become a source of praise. The pejorative position is on the one hand linked to Plato's famous declaration (as in Strabo) as well as to a popular <b>opinion</b> <b>unfavourable</b> to the singer (as in Plinius). The praise on the other hand is due to, among other things, a new way to conceive of philosophy and suggested by the summoning of him to the magi's defence (in Apollonius Tyanensis and in Apuleius). Within this context Orpheus is raised to the status of magus [...] ”), confers a title of positive value, and is thus rehabilitated as a magician. He deserves from then on to be placed near Pythagoras, Socrates and his greatest enemy, Plato himself. Therefore, when in the same period Clement of Alexandria again uses the terms found in the Res Publica and in the Laws to condemn Orpheus, and refers to his goêteia, he ignores the good reputation of the Thracian poet as a magician among some of his contemporaries in order to defend another figure accused of magic—Christ...|$|R
60|$|II. In a poem of the {{foregoing}} collection, allusion is made {{to the state of}} the workmen congregated in manufactories. In order to relieve many of the evils to which that class of society are subject, and to establish a better harmony between them and their employers, it would be well to repeal such laws as prevent the formation of joint-stock companies. There are, no doubt, many and great obstacles to the formation and salutary working of these societies, inherent in the mind of those whom they would obviously benefit. But the combinations of masters to keep down, unjustly, the price of labour would be fairly checked by them, as far as they were practicable; they would encourage economy, inasmuch as they would enable a man to draw profit from his savings, by investing them in buildings or machinery for processes of manufacture with which he was habitually connected. His little capital would then be working for him while he was at rest or asleep; he would more clearly perceive the necessity of capital for carrying on great works: he would better learn to respect the larger portions of it in the hands of others; he would be less tempted to join in unjust combinations: and, {{for the sake of his}} own property, if not for higher reasons, he would be slow to promote local disturbance, or endanger public tranquillity; he would, at least, be loth to act in that way knowingly: for it is not to be denied that such societies might be nurseries of <b>opinions</b> <b>unfavourable</b> to a mixed constitution of government, like that of Great Britain. The democratic and republican spirit which they might be apt to foster would not, however, be dangerous in itself, but only as it might act without being sufficiently counterbalanced, either by landed proprietorship, or by a Church extending itself so as to embrace an ever-growing and ever-shifting population of mechanics and artisans. But if the tendencies of such societies would be to make the men prosper who might belong to them, rulers and legislators should rejoice in the result, and do their duty to the State by upholding and extending the influence of that Church to which it owes, in so great a measure, its safety, its prosperity, and its glory.|$|R
