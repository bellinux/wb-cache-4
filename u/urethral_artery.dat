5000|$|The <b>urethral</b> <b>artery</b> {{arises from}} the {{internal}} pudendal artery a short distance {{in front of the}} artery of bulb of penis.|$|E
50|$|Some sources {{consider}} the <b>urethral</b> <b>artery</b> a direct {{branch of the}} internal pudendal artery, while others consider it {{a branch of the}} perineal artery.|$|E
50|$|In the male, it runs {{forward and}} medially, pierces the {{inferior}} fascia of the urogenital diaphragm {{and enters the}} corpus cavernosum urethræ, {{in which it is}} continued forward to the glans penis. In the female, the <b>urethral</b> <b>artery</b> serves the analogous structures. Because the female urethra is so much shorter than the male, this structure is often impossible to find on a female cadaver.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this work}} is to study the {{resistive}} index (RI) of prostatic blood flow by transrectal power Doppler sonography in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) to determine its correlation with other parameters of BPH. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-two male patients aged 52 - 86 years with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to BPH {{were included in the}} study. Patients with prostate cancer, neurogenic bladder, or with other pathology (e. g. prostatitis, bladder stone) were excluded from the study. All patients were evaluated by full history including Internatinoal Prostate Symptoms Score (IPSS), general and local examination (DRE), neurologic examination, uroflowmetry, laboratory investigations including urine analysis, routine laboratory tests and serum prostate specific antigen (PSA). Transrectal ultrasonography was used to calculate the total prostatic volume. Transrectal Power Doppler Ultrasound (PUD) was used to identify the capsular and <b>urethral</b> <b>arteries</b> of the prostate and to measures the RI value. RESULTS: The mean prostate volume was 75. 1 ± 44. 7 g. The mean RI of the right and left capsular arteries were 0. 76 ± 0. 06 and 0. 76 ± 0. 07, respectively. The mean RI of the <b>urethral</b> <b>arteries</b> was 0. 76 ± 0. 08. There was a high significative correlation between the increase of the RI of the right and left capsular and <b>urethral</b> <b>arteries</b> and the degree of obstruction (P value < 0. 001), severity of symptoms (P value < 0. 001) and also the prostatic volume (P value < 0. 001). CONCLUSION: Resistive index of the prostatic blood flow can be applied as an easy and non-invasive tool to evaluate the lower urinary tract obstruction due to BPH...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} the vascular {{anatomy of the}} prostate gland with transrectal color Doppler ultrasound (US). Thirty-five normal prostate glands were studied. Imaging findings were interpreted {{on the basis of}} findings from previous anatomic studies. Distribution of flow signals within the gland was differentiated into two parenchymal groups of <b>arteries,</b> <b>urethral</b> and capsular. The urethral group entered the prostate at the bladder neck and sent forth branches to supply the periurethral zone and the inner portion of the gland. The capsular group coursed along the anterolateral surface of the prostate and sent forth perforating branches to the outer portion of the gland. Intraprostatic venous signals were seen mainly within the periurethral zone. Transrectal color Doppler US can depict the vascular anatomy of the prostate gland. Knowledge of the normal vascular appearance of the gland should aid in the differentiation of normal from abnormal findings...|$|R
