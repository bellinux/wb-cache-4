50|$|Front {{suspension}} was of {{the double}} wishbone type. The <b>upper</b> <b>wishbone</b> consisted of a stamped steel control arm, the lower one of a stamped steel link and an adjustable forward radius rod. Coaxial coil springs and hydraulic dampers were attached to the upper wishbone; an anti-roll bar was fitted.|$|E
50|$|The car {{configuration}} {{included a}} distinctive anhedral rear wing lower element, {{the effectiveness of}} which depended on a low outboard tail section, which was achieved by totally enclosing the driveshafts within wing-section carbon fibre composite shrouds that doubled as the <b>upper</b> <b>wishbones.</b> This shroud was removable in case it was deemed to be outside the imposed regulations.|$|R
50|$|The {{successful}} mid-engined Lotus 18 of 1960 {{no longer}} had the high bodywork behind the driver's seat on which to mount the tops of the struts. Instead it used a wishbone rear suspension with wide-based tube lower wishbones carrying coilover shocks. The <b>upper</b> <b>wishbones</b> though were, once again {{in the style of the}} Chapman strut, using the driveshafts themselves and a front radius rod. This is similar to the Jaguar independent rear suspension, which also uses the driveshafts as an upper control arm.|$|R
50|$|At the , Ferrari {{introduced}} the blown diffuser, a concept first {{introduced by the}} Red Bull Racing team. Ferrari repositioned the exhaust between the rear <b>upper</b> and lower <b>wishbones,</b> beefed up the bodywork and rear <b>upper</b> and lower <b>wishbone</b> assemblies to handle the temperatures and repositioned the rear brake ducts.|$|R
50|$|The Chapman strut {{used the}} driveshafts as {{suspension}} arms, thus requiring only {{the weight of}} one component rather than two. Jaguar's patented independent rear suspension (IRS) similarly reduced unsprung mass by replacing the <b>upper</b> <b>wishbone</b> arms of the suspension with the drive shafts, as well as mounting the brakes inboard in some versions.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the last}} {{mass-production}} sports cars to still use lever arm shock absorbers was the MG B. This had a lever arm shock absorber as the <b>upper</b> <b>wishbone.</b> A popular handling upgrade in later years was to fit telescopic shock absorbers instead. The lever arm wishbone was still retained, but now as a simple wishbone with no damping.|$|E
50|$|Many cars of {{this period}} began to use {{independent}} front suspension, often a double wishbone. The <b>upper</b> <b>wishbone</b> could conveniently {{also be used as}} the lever of the shock absorber, reducing the mass and bulk of the suspension, and also avoiding at least one ball joint. The spindle of the shock absorber now became the upper suspension pivot, usually double-ended.|$|E
50|$|This was {{the first}} Bentley to {{dispense}} with a leaf-sprung front beam axle. It followed Rolls-Royce's lead from 1936 and instead used a new design of independent front suspension in its completely new chassis. Low rate open coil springs sat within pairs of triangulated wishbones holding the front wheels at their outer point. The <b>upper</b> <b>wishbones</b> acted on a piston-type hydraulic damper, the arms at the bottom were set wide apart so that the rearward one could act as a torque member under braking. These assemblies on each side were linked by a strong anti-roll bar.|$|R
50|$|The XM series Falcon {{range was}} {{introduced}} in February 1964, {{as a replacement for}} the XL series Falcon. The XM featured around 1,500 modifications from the XL, including numerous changes to the suspension which now featured stronger ball joints, new front <b>upper</b> <b>wishbones,</b> coil-over shock units and relocated rear spring-hangers. Also new were bigger axle shafts and tougher engine mounts. The vacuum operated windscreen wipers of the XL series were replaced by a two-speed electric motor unit and the seats were stronger with better quality upholstery. Unlike previous Australian Falcons, the XM represented a significant departure from the contemporary US Ford Falcon models in terms of exterior styling.|$|R
50|$|The Europa's four-wheel {{independent}} suspension was also typical Chapman thinking. The front used lightweight pressed steel <b>upper</b> and lower <b>wishbones</b> with a clever coil-over spring-damper arrangement, all {{connected to the}} wheels using off-the-shelf front uprights, ball joints and trunnions.The steering gear was solid-mounted rack and pinion using Truimph Herald components.|$|R
50|$|The front {{suspension}} used {{very tall}} uprights with the wheel spindles {{on one side}} and a short stub axle extending inwards on the other. Springing was by vertically mounted coil-over-damper units mounted inboard and operated through rocker-style upper arms. The lower arms were conventional wide-based wishbones made of a one-piece wishbone and long radius arm running back towards the bulkhead. Steering was rack-and-pinion mounted high, at the same level as the <b>upper</b> <b>wishbone.</b>|$|E
50|$|The front {{suspension}} was by {{double wishbone}} arms with outboard coil/damper unit. Unlike Chapman's former designs where {{the ends of}} anti-roll bar acted as a leg of the <b>upper</b> <b>wishbone,</b> the 18 had a separate front anti-roll bar. The rear suspension was by upper and lower radius arms with reversed lower wishbone, where the fixed-length halfshaft acted as the upper link. The coil/damper unit was also mounted outboard in the rear, and the 18 sometimes ran with and without the rear anti-roll bar.|$|E
50|$|The ladder chassis {{was made}} by Alfa Romeo for the central-mounted engine, with {{straight}} rails from front to the rear end of the car; it was numbered 700316 as per engine number.The final suspension was all-independent, with “silent bloc” bushes;front it consisted of double wishbones, with a thick sheet steel (4 mm) <b>upper</b> <b>wishbone,</b> lever-arm Houdaille hydraulic dampers, longitudinal torsion bars, and lower location through a transverse leaf spring; {{at the rear of}} swing axles and radius arms, with a transverse leaf spring and longitudinal torsion bars.|$|E
50|$|The 2006 {{specification}} GP2 Car {{has been}} designed by Dallara Automobili. The 2006 GP2 car features a biplane rear wing, with the triplane rear wing used in 2005 only to be used at the Monaco race. The front <b>upper</b> and lower <b>wishbones</b> have been reinforced, as have {{the front and rear}} suspension uprights.|$|R
50|$|Although {{based on}} the {{two-seater}} vehicle designs, Mondials are slightly larger overall including having appreciably wider front and rear track dimensions. Suspension systems are fully-independent all-round, comprising unequal-length <b>upper</b> and lower <b>wishbones,</b> coil-over damper units and anti-roll bars {{at each end of}} the vehicle. Mondial t vehicles include a driver-adjustable selector to set the electronically controlled damper units, providing three choices of ride-stiffness adjustment.|$|R
50|$|If {{coil springs}} are used, then a lateral {{location}} link (usually either a Panhard rod or Watt's linkage) is required, plus additional torque links {{on each side}} (five link suspension) {{or a combination of}} lower trailing links and an <b>upper</b> transverse <b>wishbone.</b> None of these additional links are required if leaf springs are used, but ride can be compromised due to the leaves having to do double duty as both locating links and springs. The torque links are not required if the setup uses inboard brakes, like in the Pegaso 1502, Rover P6, all Iso cars and Alfa Romeo type 116 (and derivatives), as the wheels do not transmit torque to the suspension.|$|R
5000|$|A {{key element}} of the Mark X that Jaguar wanted {{to include in the}} S-Type was its sophisticated, and by then widely acclaimed, Jaguar {{independent}} rear suspension. The suspension was a revelation {{at the time of its}} introduction, and remained the benchmark against which others were judged until the 1980s. Essentially a double wishbone setup, it uses the driveshaft as the <b>upper</b> <b>wishbone.</b> It carries the drive, braking, suspension and damping units in a single fabricated steel crossbridge, which is isolated from the bodyshell by rubber blocks. Including this suspension in the S-Type necessitated the development of a new crossbridge suitable for its 54" [...] track, coming as it did between the 58" [...] track of the Mark X and 50" [...] track of the E-Type.|$|E
5000|$|The Lunar Roving Vehicle had {{a mass of}} 210 kg, and was {{designed}} to hold a payload of 490 kg. This resulted in weights in the approximately one-sixth g on the lunar surface of [...] empty and [...] fully loaded. The frame was 10 ft long with a wheelbase of 7.5 ft. The height of the vehicle was 3.6 ft. The frame was made of 2219 aluminium alloy tubing welded assemblies and consisted of a three-part chassis that was hinged in the center {{so it could be}} folded up and hung in the Lunar Module Quadrant 1 bay. It had two side-by-side foldable seats made of tubular aluminium with nylon webbing and aluminum floor panels. An armrest was mounted between the seats, and each seat had adjustable footrests and a Velcro-fastened seat belt. A large mesh dish antenna was mounted on a mast on the front center of the rover. The suspension consisted of a double horizontal wishbone with upper and lower torsion bars and a damper unit between the chassis and <b>upper</b> <b>wishbone.</b> Fully loaded, the LRV had a ground clearance of 14 in.|$|E
5000|$|Fibreglass, Kevlar, {{and other}} {{composites}} make the body shell, fitted to a backbone chassis. The suspension is true Formula 1 and IndyCar technology with independent <b>upper</b> and lower <b>wishbone</b> with pushrod {{front and rear}} end suspension. The Guarà {{is known for its}} highly agile handling which makes it a bit too [...] "nervous" [...] for the average driver. The Guarà has no luggage space at all, the area under the front being taken up by the racing-style suspension. The large, distinct rims are by Marchesini.|$|R
50|$|The 2011 {{specification}} GP2 Series car {{has been}} designed by Dallara Automobili. The 2006 GP2 car featured a biplane rear wing, with the triplane rear wing used in previous seasons only to be used at the Monaco race. The front <b>upper</b> and lower <b>wishbones</b> have been reinforced, as have {{the front and rear}} suspension uprights. Currently, Dallara GP2/11 are the current chassis since debut in 2011 and will be used until end of 2017 season. The price of Dallara GP2/11 FIA Formula 2 Championship cars are approximately up to €1.5 million-€2 million per car (including wheels, tyres, wings, steering wheel and other components excluding engine).|$|R
50|$|The only F1 chassis Shannon Racing Cars made had steel {{monocoque}} frame, <b>upper</b> {{and lower}} <b>wishbone</b> front suspension with outboard brake and anti-roll bar. It {{was a very}} compact design with upper I arm and lower reversed A arm with upper and lower radius arms mated with outboard spring/damper unit, outboard brake and anti-roll bar in the rear. The rear arm of the front upper A arm was much thicker than the front tube, acting as a canti-lever to operate the inboard spring/damper unit mounted vertically. The monocoque extended {{to the rear of}} the engine, with the gearbox sticking out further aft. Another monocoque tub was made in aluminium, but was never used.|$|R
5000|$|The {{team was}} forced to {{withdraw}} from the second pre-season test in Barcelona when Romain Grosjean complained about a [...] "strange" [...] feeling in the chassis while driving on the opening morning of the test. The team gave no official diagnosis of the problem at the time, but speculation within the media suggested the problem was related to the front suspension and that the problem presented itself at the Circuit de Catalunya because of the higher lateral loads placed on the chassis at the circuit than those experienced at Jerez. James Allison, the team's technical director, later confirmed that the team had identified the problem as being the mounting of the <b>upper</b> front <b>wishbone</b> on the rear suspension arm. Grosjean had been testing the chassis designated E20-02 at the time; the chassis E20-01 was returned to the team's Enstone facility following completion of testing at Jerez. Upon discovering the problem, Lotus initially prepared chassis E20-01 to be transported to Barcelona to complete the test, but simulations revealed that the problem was also present on E20-01, and so the team decided {{to withdraw from the}} remainder of the test with immediate effect. The problem was then corrected in time for the team to start the season.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Suspension {{system is}} major {{part in a}} vehicle, the <b>wishbone</b> <b>upper</b> control arm {{is a type of}} a {{independent}} suspension used in passenger car. In this work it is mainly concentrated on stiffness, slippage and damage of upper control arm. The upper control arm is subjected to different type of loads such as static loads and cyclic loads. Stiffness is improved by changing shape and size of upper control arm this is achieved by static analysis. This analysis is carried out to find displacement, stress and stiffness. Due to some loading conditions, slippage occurs in between arm and bush. In this work slippage analysis carried out to check whether slippage occurs in the upper control arm. Fatigue analysis carried out to determine the damage and life of upper control arm...|$|R
40|$|A {{study on}} the design of the front {{suspension}} geometry and steering system to be used in a solar electric vehicle. The suspension geometry utilizes a double wishbone design that is optimized to fit in the space constraints of the vehicle. The steering system consists of a rack and pinion connected through tie rods to the steering knuckles, largely optimized based on the space within the vehicle. The final suspension geometry consists of <b>upper</b> and lower <b>wishbone</b> lengths of 4. 25 inches and 3. 75 inches, respectively. This system is optimized to maintain a proper camber angle and minimize scrub due to track distance changes throughout the travel of the suspension. The geometry of the steering system is designed to fit in the vehicle while achieving a near- Ackermann steering condition. The steering knuckle and steering rack extenders, both made out of Aluminum 6061 -T 6, are designed based off of this geometry and are optimized for weight and machinability. by Bruce Arensen.

50|$|Launched in 1991 {{and sold}} to Fisher Sportscars in 1994. Currently owned by Fury Sportscars who {{recently}} purchased the rights from BGH Geartech., based in Kent UK.The Fury has been very successful in competition with cars currently racing in many championships, including the 750 Motor Club's RGB (Road-Going Bike-Engined Kitcar) and Kitcar series. Many different engines can be fitted to the Fury, including all manner of car engines from the Ford Crossflow to Rover V8 and Cosworth Turbo. Motorbike engines have also been fitted and are popular for track cars due to the low weight, high power and built-in sequential gearbox for relatively little morey.There are {{two versions of the}} Fury rear suspension, the Live Axle version uses the Ford Escort rear axle located using two trailing links in conjunction with a Panhard rod. Coil over shock absorbers are used to give good ride comfort combined with excellent handling and grip. The Independent Rear Suspension version uses the Ford Sierra rear hub assembly in conjunction with purpose built hub carriers forming the uprights between <b>upper</b> and lower <b>wishbones.</b> Once again, coil over shock absorbers ensure a refined ride quality and excellent traction.|$|R
5000|$|A {{total of}} 50 {{identical}} experimental Turbine Cars were built between October 1963 and October 1964. Huebner {{referred to the}} experimental cars as uniquely designed. Each body was finished and shipped to Detroit and then the employees installed the gas turbine engines, Torqueflite transmissions, and electrical components to prepare the cars for use. There were 203 nationwide motorists - 23 of them women - who were chosen to test the uniquely designed automobiles. Suspension did not follow Chrysler's ubiquitous independent front longitudinal torsion bar system of the time, but rather featured contemporary designs using independent front suspension with a coil spring at each wheel. Rear suspension was more typical of Chrysler, with leaf springs and direct-acting shock absorbers.The Turbine Car is a two-door hardtop coupe with four individual bucket seats, power steering, air-over-oil power brakes, and power windows. Its most prominent design features are two large horizontal taillights and nozzles (back-up lights) mounted inside a very heavy chrome sculptured bumper. Up front, the single headlamps are mounted in chrome nacelles with a turbine styling theme which is carried through to the center console and the hubcaps. Even the tires were specially made with small turbine vanes molded into the white sidewalls. The body is finished in a metallic, root beer-colored paint dubbed [...] "turbine bronze". The roof is covered in black vinyl, and the interior features bronze-colored [...] "English calfskin" [...] leather upholstery with plush-cut pile bronze-colored carpet. Front suspension is <b>upper</b> and lower <b>wishbones</b> with coil springs and shock absorbers.|$|R
