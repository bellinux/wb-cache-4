40|$|A case of {{alpha chain}} disease, {{involving}} the stomach only, is reported in an Algerian man suffering from epigastric pains. Upper digestive tract fibreoptic endoscopy showed two antral ulcers and an <b>ulcerative</b> <b>gastritis</b> pattern, which promptly disappeared with cimetidine treatment. Antral biopsies {{at a distance}} from the ulcers, but not of the ulcer crater itself, disclosed a dense infiltration of antral lamina propria by mature or sometimes atypical plasma cells. On transmural surgical antral biopsy, the infiltrate spread to the superficial part of the submucosa. No other localisation of the disease was found in spite of multiple biopsies obtained by endoscopy, with a peroral capsule and during staging laparotomy. The alpha chain disease protein was absent from serum and urine, but found in the gastric juice and in the cytoplasma of the cellular infiltrate (alpha 1 subclass). A complete clinical, endoscopic, histological and immunological remission was observed after a six months' course of oral tetracycline...|$|E
40|$|Sarcina ventriculi is a Gram-positive, obligate {{anaerobic}} coccus, with {{a characteristic}} morphology. Only 22 cases of human infections by this microorganism, including 7 in children, {{have been reported}} in literature so far. Affected subjects usually present with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and delayed gastric emptying. However, life-threatening complications, like emphysematous gastritis and gastric perforation have also been described. Gastroparesis and gastric outlet obstruction have been considered as a potential etiologic factor. All pediatric cases described thus far presented with concomitant gastrointestinal pathology, such as Helicobacter pylori gastritis, celiac disease, infection with Giardia lamblia or Candida spp. Here, we report two children with S. ventriculi infection, in whom the diagnosis was established by typical histological findings in mucosal biopsies. The first child presented with hematemesis due to ulcerative esophagitis and gastritis, the second child with a history of esophageal stricture had <b>ulcerative</b> <b>gastritis.</b> Confirmation of S. ventriculi infection is feasible by molecular microbiota detection methods, since this microorganism cannot be detected by classical culture techniques. Prompt treatment with antibiotics could prevent life-threatening complications...|$|E
40|$|Introduction & Objective: Different {{studies show}} that the reasons for {{clinically}} diverse outcomes of infections caused by H. pylori may include host and environmental factors as well as differences in the prevalence or expression of bacterial virulence factors. The aim {{of this study was to}} study the distribution of different genotypes of major virulence factors cagA, vacA and ureAB among H. pylori strains isolated from patients with gastric ulcer (ulcerative disease) and patients with gastritis (non ulcerative disease). Materials & Methods: In this cross sectional study 65 H. pylori strains, 30 from patients with gastric ulcer and 35 from patients with non <b>ulcerative</b> <b>gastritis</b> disease were investigated by RFLP-PCR. Results: The prevalence of vacA-positive strains in ulcerative patients was significantly more than that in non ulcerative patients (P 0. 05). Conclusion: It seems that in the patients under our study the presence of cagA gene may not necessarily be a risk factor for ulcer disease, while a homologous genotype of vacA appears to be associated with an increase risk of ulcer development. Lastly, despite the existence of a high degree of genomic variability within ureAB, conserved DNA banding profiles are distributed in our areas...|$|E
25|$|Gastrointestinal {{disorders}} are another {{common cause of}} unexplained weight loss – in fact {{they are the most}} common non-cancerous cause of idiopathic weight loss. Possible gastrointestinal etiologies of unexplained weight loss include: celiac disease, peptic ulcer disease, inflammatory bowel disease (crohn's disease and <b>ulcerative</b> colitis), pancreatitis, <b>gastritis,</b> diarrhea and many other GI conditions.|$|R
40|$|Context and Objectives Focally {{enhanced}} gastritis and macrophage microaggregates {{are found}} in the upper gastrointestinal involvement of Crohn&# 8217;s disease, and may reflect an underlying defective innate immunity. These features, however, are also described in patients with Helicobacter pylori infection. The role of these gastric abnormalities in the diagnosis of Crohn&# 8217;s disease was assessed in a population with high prevalence of H. pylori infection. Methods Thirty-seven Crohn&# 8217;s disease, 26 ulcerative colitis, and 30 control patients were included. The H. pylori status was evaluated by the rapid urease test and histology. The presence of focally enhanced gastritis and macrophage microaggregates was recorded. Results Focally enhanced gastritis was present in 24 % of Crohn&# 8217;s disease patients, 4 % of ulcerative colitis patients and 11. 5 % of controls, presenting an overall sensitivity and specificity for Crohn&# 8217;s disease of 24 % and 88 %, respectively. Macrophage microaggregates were found in all groups, but were only detected in ulcerative colitis and controls in association with H. pylori infection, with an overall sensitivity and specificity for Crohn&# 8217;s disease of 61 % and 69 %, respectively. In the absence of H. pylori infection, focally enhanced gastritis and macrophage microaggregates were significantly associated with Crohn&# 8217;s disease (P< 0. 02 and P = 0. 001 respectively). Conclusions Focally gastritis and macrophage microaggregates are suggestive of Crohn&# 8217;s disease only in H. pylori-negative specimens.

40|$|H. pylori {{infection}} {{is a very}} common infection of the human stomach, related to various diseases such as <b>gastritis,</b> <b>ulcerative</b> disease of the duodenum and stomach, {{mucosa associated lymphoid tissue}} lymphomas and gastric cancer. It is generally accepted that the majority of related diseases is curable once H. pylori {{infection is}} successfully eradicated. H. pylori eradication will only be achieved after administration of combination therapies including antibiotics and antacids. Resistance to metronidazole and clarithromycin is an emerging problem, leading to impairment of eradication efficacy, irrespective of the regimen administered. Eradication regimens consisting of three or four anti-H. pylori drugs are the most efficacious. Given the easy use and high convenience to the patients and the high efficacy, 1 -week proton pump inhibitor (PPI) -triple therapy is preferred as the first-line therapy. Alternatively, bismuth triple therapy or the combination of antacids and bismuth triple therapy can be prescribed; however, these regimens are less convenient to the patients, the course is prolonged or the side effects occur more frequently compared with PPI-triple therap...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} the susceptibility of the agile wallaby (Macropus agilis) and the dusky pademelon (Thylogale brunii) to infection with Trypanosoma evansi. Method. Two agile wallabies and three dusky pademelons were experimentally infected with between 5 times 104 and 10 times 104 T evansi from a cryopreserved stabilate isolated from an Indonesian buffalo. Animals were observed twice daily for clinical signs and blood was collected every 3 days to determine parasitaemia. Necropsy {{was conducted on}} animals that died or were euthanased when in extremis and representative tissue sections examined. Results. All wallabies developed a high parasitaemia by 6 days after infection, which persisted until death or euthanasia in extremis, between days 8 and 61. Clinical signs included anorexia, weakness and ataxia. Anaemia occurred in one wallaby that survived for 61 days. Gross pathological changes varied between animals. They included pericarditis, serous atrophy of fat, splenomegaly, <b>ulcerative</b> <b>gastritis</b> and enteritis. Histological changes were characterised by a mononuclear cell infiltration of the connective tissue of most organs with little cellular destruction. Striking lesions were seen in the choroid, heart, stomach and small intestine. Conclusion. Agile wallabies and pademelons are highly susceptible to infection with T evansi. Wallabies, therefore, {{have the potential to}} spread T evansiwithin New Guinea and Australia if infection is introduced. Mortality is likely to be high thereby acting as an indicator of recent introduction. Histological changes seen in wallabies infected with T evansi are diagnostic for infections occurring in Australia and Papua New Guinea...|$|E
40|$|The {{marine otter}} (Lontra felina) is a poorly studied South American otter of {{conservation}} concern. Between 2004 and 2006 {{as part of}} radiotelemetry, genetic and veterinary studies, 16 marine otters (10 males and six females), with an average body mass of 3. 8 ± 0. 3 kg, were trapped in the coast of Central and South Chile. Twenty anaesthetic procedures were evaluated, including chemical immobilizations and anaesthesia for surgical radiotransmitter implantations. We used an intramuscular anaesthetic combination of ketamine 5 mg/kg and medetomidine 50 μg/kg. Minor complications included mild hypothermia and hypoxemia. After 47 ± 10 min, anaesthesia was antagonized with atipamezole 236 ± 38 μg/kg i. m. Full anaesthetic recovery was achieved at 12. 0 ± 6. 2 min. Six otters (three males and three females) were subjected to surgical radiotransmitter placement through a ventral midline celiotomy. These individuals were housed in a quarantine room in wire-mesh cages (0. 9 m long × 0. 4 m wide × 0. 48 m high), joined with a polyvinyl chloride pipe that served as den (1 m long × 0. 4 m diameter). While in captivity, diet consisted on fresh silverside fish (Odontesthes regia) plus several local crab and fish species. During their acclimation period prior to surgery, these individuals received a captivity protocol which included the administration of enrofloxacin, ketoprofen, ivermectin and vitamin supplements. Three otters died in captivity, and severe and moderate <b>ulcerative</b> <b>gastritis</b> was diagnosed at the post-mortem examination. None of the operated otters had surgical complications, and full wound healing was completed by 13 ± 3 days, time when the animals were released. During monitoring by radiotelemetry otters became established in their home ranges...|$|E
40|$|Thrombocytopenia is {{a common}} {{laboratory}} finding in cats, but {{there are only a}} few clinical reports about feline thrombocytopenia. As a result of the relatively large feline platelet size (11 - 18 fl) and the tendency for clumping automated platelet counts are frequently inaccurate (too low, so called pseudothrombocytopenia). The purpose of our prospective study (January 1999 -June 2000) was to determine the relationship between the manual and the automated platelet count. All thrombocytopenic cats, which were presented at the Clinic for Small Animals, Berlin, had a complete examination in order to find the cause of the thrombocytopenia. For the first time platelet-bound antibodies (PBA) in cats were detected by flow cytometry. Further on the buccal mucosa bleeding time of 35 cats was determined and evaluated. Comparison of automatic and manual platelet counting The platelet counting was performed manually (Thrombo Plus®, Sarstedt, Nümbrecht) and automatically (Cell-Dyn 3500, Abbott, Wiesbaden) in 217 feline blood samples within 30 minutes after blood taking. The average platelet count was 139, 527 /µl (range 1, 000  858, 000 /µl) in the automatical count and 177, 251 /µl (range 6, 000  970, 000 /µl) in the manual count. In 161 samples the automatic counter demonstrated the blood samples to be thrombocytopenic. However, the manual counting proved in 39 of these samples that the automatic counting had given false low results and in further 47 cases the automatic counts were too high. We observed a correlation of only r = 0. 789 for manual and automatic platelet counts, which means, that reliable platelet counts in cats can only be achieved manually. Diagnoses of 63 thrombocytopenic cats The diagnoses of 63 thrombocytopenic cats (range 10, 000  179, 000 /µl, median [M]: 83, 000) were based on history, signalment, the complete blood cell count, serum biochemical screening, serology, the results of radiography and ultrasonography as well as further examinations (for example cytology, histopathology). Platelet-bound antibodies were determined in 42 of these cats. 17 (Tc/µl: 16, 000  179, 000, M: 57, 000) of these 63 cats suffered from viral infections such as FIP (7), FeLV (3), FIV (4) and feline rhinitis with secondary bacterial infection (3). 22 cats had either an aseptic inflammation (Tc/µl: 15, 000  178, 000, M: 84, 000) (fat necrosis [4], traumata [4], pancreatitis [2], FLUTD [2], (cholangio) -hepatitis [2], nasal polyp [1] and gastritis with ulcer [1],) or a bacterial infection (Tc/µl: 37, 000  168, 000, M: 85, 000) (pneumonia [2], urolithiasis with obstruction and cystitis [1], pyelonephritis [1], abscess [1], pyometra [1]). Ten (Tc/µl: 22, 000  178, 000, M: 88, 000) of 63 cats had neoplasia (lymphoma [6], leukemia [2], fibrosarcoma of the kidney [1] and hemangiosarcoma [1]). Three of 63 cats with thrombocytopenia suffered from bone marrow diseases (megakaryocytic and/or erythroid aplasia resp. -hypoplasia) and the platelets ranged from 34, 000  168, 000 /µl (M: 115, 000). Three cats were diagnosed with immune-mediated diseases (immune-hemolytic anaemia [IHA], primary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia [pIMT], Evans´ syndrome) (Tc/µl: 10, 000  83, 000, M: 46, 000). Four (Tc/µl: 18, 500  175, 000, M: 149, 500) of 63 cats suffered from a variety of diseases (renal failure [1], hyperthyroidism with cardiomyopathy [1], hepatopathy [2]). The thrombocytopenia (Tc/µl: 76, 000  162, 000, M: 109, 000) was a random finding in hemograms of four cats at a routine check up. Spontaneous bleeding (i. e. bleeding of the gums [4], petechiation [4], epistaxis [1], retinal and scleral hemorrhage [1] resp. abdominal hemorrhage [1]) was observed in only 7 (Tc/µl: 10, 000  57, 000, M: 34, 000) of 63 thrombocytopenic cats (with diagnosis of FIV [3], pIMT, Evans´ syndrome, leukemia and megakaryocytic and erythroid aplasia). Detection of platelet-bound antibodies (PBA) This study evaluated the presence of antibodies on the platelet-membrane in a direct assay by flow cytometry (FACScan, Becton Dickinson, New Jersey USA) in cats. First of all feline platelets were determined by using monoclonal antibodies (goat-anti-mouse). With polyclonal antibodies (goat-anti-cat with a specifity against heavy chains on cat IgG) were detected those platelets, which carried antibodies. All of the 47 healthy cats had a negative test result. 19 of 42 thrombocytopenic cats (Tc/µl: 6, 000  179, 000, &# 63426;: 59, 947) had a positive PBA test result. 17 of these 19 cats had a secondary IMT. The underlying diseases were: fat necrosis (4), FIP (3), FeLV- (2) / FIV- (2) infection, lymphoma (2), leukemia (2), hepatitis (1), pyelonephritis (1) and hyperthyroidism with cardiomyopathy (1). No underlying disease was discovered in two cats: one cat had an Evans´ syndrome and the other pIMT. In 23 cats with thrombocytopenia (Tc/µl: 15, 000  206, 000, &# 63426;: 89, 108) the PBA test results were negative including cats with FIP (4), with lymphoma (3), FIV (2), pancreatitis (2), cholangiohepatitis (1) and hepatitis (1). Several diseases such as FeLV-infection, IMHA, erythroid and megakaryocytic aplasia, pneumonia, leukemia, nasal polyp, abscess, FLUTD with obstruction, <b>ulcerative</b> <b>gastritis</b> and peritoneopericardial hernia only occurred once. Similar to humans and dogs, this study suggested that an immune-mediated destruction of platelets could play an important role in the pathogenesis of feline thrombocytopenia. Primary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia seems to be less common or it is difficult to diagnose, maybe because spontaneous bleeding is rare in cats. Buccal mucosa bleeding time (BMBT) A disposable spring loaded blade, that made a standardised cut of 3 mm length and 0. 5 mm depth, was used to measure the BMBT. Altogether the BMBT was determined in 35 anesthetized cats at the oral mucosa surfaces of the upper lip. The mean ± 2 standard deviation of 15 healthy cats was 55. 3 ± 43. 2 sec (range 30  105 sec). Seven thrombocytopenic cats had a marked mean prolongation in BMBT (BMBT 45  300 sec), while the BMBT (< 5  120 sec) of 13 cats with various diseases without thrombocytopenia was similar to the mean for healthy cats...|$|E
