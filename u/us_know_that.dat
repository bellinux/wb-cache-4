500|$|Casting {{director}} Rick Millikan was {{tasked with}} finding a suitable actor {{to play the}} part of the beggar. Millikan's only instructions were to look for [...] "a small all-Indian man with no legs." [...] Eventually, Gurdeep Roy, better known as Deep Roy was chosen to play the part. Deep Roy was a noted stunt man who had notably played Droopy McCool of the Max Rebo Band in Return of the Jedi. Deep Roy, however, is not an amputee and so a cart with a false bottom was created. Anytime there was a scene where the beggar had to move, blue screen technology was used to add the background in during post-production. The cart featured a distinct [...] "squeak" [...] that Paul Rabwin described as [...] "creepy". He noted, [...] "There was a squeak that had to let <b>us</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> it was him. It had to scare us [...] Finally we came up with what we thought was just the right squeak and John [...] said 'Okay, that's the one.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Following its premiere, {{the video}} for [...] "Triumphant (Get 'Em)" [...] was {{generally}} well received by critics. E!'s Bruna Nessif commended Carey's [...] "post-baby body", and wrote [...] " [...] {{made sure to}} let <b>us</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> her comeback isn't only in the music world, but physically, too." [...] Tanner Stransky from Entertainment Weekly felt the video was [...] "very fitting" [...] for the song's vibe, and felt it presented [...] "a distinct level of Mimi fabulosity." [...] A reporter from the Daily Mail called the visuals [...] "sizzling", and complimented the singers moments on the golden stage as [...] "glittering" [...] and [...] "fabulous". The Hollywood Reporters David Lipshutz described the video as a [...] "glitzy clip". Additionally, he outed its final segment of [...] "Carey singing while confetti rain down" [...] as the video's highlight. While noting the video's [...] "classic Mimi fashions", MTV's Jocelyn Vena expressed how Carey's ringside singing during the finale truly tied in with the song's message of [...] "overcoming adversity". Marc Hogan of Spin noted it as [...] "expensive-looking and cinematic", while a writer from CNN described the singer as [...] "glamorous as ever." ...|$|E

500|$|Muransky {{also set}} the all-time [...] "Beef Bowl" [...] record by {{consuming}} [...] of prime rib at Lawry's before the 1979 Rose Bowl. Muransky later recalled: [...] "Bubba Paris and I were two happy freshmen eating {{together at the}} Lawry's Beef Bowl event before the 1979 Rose Bowl Game. After we had enjoyed our fourth plate of prime rib, mashed potatoes, corn and Yorkshire pudding, Bubba asked what the record was, and they said 7 cuts. Bubba continued for 3 more cuts, and I continued for four, totally under the Bo Schembechler radar screen. When they delivered the 8th cut to me, the media started to gather around my table, Bo walked by {{and let me know}} what he was thinking without ever saying a word. Afterward, a Paris-Muransky night out ended with some pizza. The next morning in practice, Bo made an example of Bubba and me. We never ran so much in our lives as we did that day. We were in every play of scrimmage and then we ran sprints." [...] When the Wolverines returned to Pasadena for the 1981 Rose Bowl, [...] "Bo {{made it a point to}} come to the back of the plane and talk to me and Bubba Paris. He wanted to let <b>us</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> my record from a couple years earlier would not be in jeopardy because we were going to be sitting with him at the Lawry's Beef Bowl. He said he was going to limit each of us to two cuts of prime rib." [...] Schembechler had his own take on the story: [...] "I let 'em eat because they were freshmen. They weren't gonna play anyway." ...|$|E
500|$|Scar has {{garnered}} widespread acclaim from film critics, {{some of whom}} praised him as {{a better}} character than Simba. Author Peter M. Nichols wrote in his book New York Times Essential Library: Children's Movies: A Critic's Guide to the Best Films Available on Video and DVD that Scar [...] "is the most interesting character in the film," [...] describing Simba and Mufasa [...] "bores in comparison." [...] Janet Maslin of The New York Times called Scar a [...] "delectably wicked" [...] villain. Maslin went on to praise Irons' voice acting, writing that the actor [...] "slithers through the story in grandiose high style, with a green-eyed malevolence {{that is one of}} film's chief delights." [...] Leah Rozen of People described Scar as [...] "a flawless realization of Irons' special talent." [...] Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune lauded Scar as the film's [...] "best character," [...] jokingly describing him as [...] "Irons' Claus von Bulow with fur." [...] Similarly, ComingSoon.net's Joshua Starnes hailed Scar as [...] "the best part of the film." [...] Praising both Scar and Irons' acting, Starnes continued, [...] "He switches so quickly and easily from campy to deadly its like a showcase for how to do an over-the-top villain right." [...] Concluding that [...] "Villains are often the most memorable characters in a Disney animated film," [...] Roger Ebert described Scar [...] "one of the great ones." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews reviewed, [...] "Gone is the buffoonery that has marked the recent trio of Ursula, Gaston, and Jafar," [...] writing, [...] "Scar is a sinister figure, given to acid remarks and cunning villainy." [...] Berardinelli concluded, [...] "The cold-hearted manner in which he causes Mufasa's death lets <b>us</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> this is not a lion to be trifled with." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN {{reviewer}} Matt Fowler {{gave the}} episode an [...] "Incredible" [...] rating of 9.6/10, saying that: [...] "I'm sure we all loved Dexter's final moments with Arthur, {{down in the}} toy train bomb shelter, but now {{looking back at the}} scene, knowing the final moments of the episode, it's filled with so many more eerie easter eggs. Something was definitely up when Arthur said, [...] "It's already over." [...] We all thought so because we've heard him say those words before. We also saw Dexter take a beat after the line, confused about its meaning. We could have chalked it {{up to the fact that}} Arthur was accepting his own death, but Dexter's furrowed brow let <b>us</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> something more sinister was in play here. Of course, the real bitch here is that Dexter, having dispatched of Trinity officially, now can't go back and do it with the spirit of vengeance. The scene stands quite beautifully on its own, but Dexter would certainly have not given Arthur an empathetic send off if he knew what that monster had done. We can all point fingers at certain missteps that Dexter took throughout the entire season - mistakes that led to Rita's demise - but when you take it in as a whole it's a rather satisfying and cleverly constructed story that actually made us all buy and believe, by the end, that Dexter truly wanted to be rid of his murderous spirit. His stubborn need to kill Trinity himself wound up circumventing the entire justice system, which would have wound up catching Arthur based solely on Deb's tenacity and expert detective work." [...] Also, IGN listed Arthur Mitchell as 2nd on a list of Dexter's Top 10 Kills saying that [...] "This was the murder that America was clamoring for. And it was effin' great." [...] In his review of the entire fourth season, Fowler, giving the season an [...] "Incredible" [...] rating of 9.5, said of the finale that [...] "It all just came off as a ton of creepy, guilty fun. I would bet that when we all saw the final scene of the season finale that we, simply due to the time we've spent the characters over four years, felt a ton of emotions that we might not have even known were there." ...|$|E

In a review of Dope's album Felons and Revolutionaries, NME said [...] "In American Pie, a boy puts his cock in an apple pie, to let <b>us</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> there's something rotten {{at the heart of the}} American Dream. Ex-con brothers Edsel and Simon Dope, though, would probably put someone else's cock in the apple pie, cut it off, lace the pie with strychnine, and serve it up at the Clinton dinner table." ...|$|E

I hope you hear me, sir ... the brave man who provided CPR to our fallen heroes, we thank you, we thank you {{from the bottom of}} our hearts.

5000|$|Inexperienced {{writers are}} often advised to show {{rather than to}} describe. One of the mysteries of Gallico's style is its {{effectiveness}} despite his constant violation of this rule.

[...] When he wants <b>us</b> to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Mouche is innocent, he tells us of her [...] "innocence and primitive mind." [...] When he wants <b>us</b> to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Rhayader has a warm heart in his crippled body, he says [...] "His body was warped, but his heart was filled with love for wild and hunted things."
