The Desert Sunlight Solar Farm <b>under</b> <b>construction</b> <b>in</b> Riverside County, California and Topaz Solar Farm {{being built in}} San Luis Obispo County, California are both 550 MW solar parks that will use {{thin-film}} solar photovoltaic modules made by First Solar. The Blythe Solar Power Project is a 500 MW photovoltaic station <b>under</b> <b>construction</b> <b>in</b> Riverside County, California. The California Valley Solar Ranch (CVSR) is a 250megawatt (MW) solar photovoltaic power plant, which is being built by SunPower in the Carrizo Plain, northeast of California Valley. The 230 MW Antelope Valley Solar Ranch is a First Solar photovoltaic project which is <b>under</b> <b>construction</b> <b>in</b> the Antelope Valley area of the Western Mojave Desert, and due {{to be completed in}} 2013. The Mesquite Solar project is a photovoltaic solar power plant being built in Arlington, Maricopa County, Arizona, owned by Sempra Generation.

5|$|Although argon is non-toxic, it is 38% denser than air and {{therefore}} considered a dangerous asphyxiant in closed areas. It {{is difficult to}} detect because it is colorless, odorless, and tasteless. A 1994 incident, in which a man was asphyxiated after entering an argon-filled section of oil pipe <b>under</b> <b>construction</b> <b>in</b> Alaska, highlights the dangers of argon tank leakage in confined spaces and emphasizes the need for proper use, storage and handling.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the First World War, the Austro-Hungarian Navy's U-boat fleet consisted of six largely experimental submarines of three classes. The Navy had five larger, more modern submarines (what would have been the U-7 class) <b>under</b> <b>construction</b> <b>in</b> Germany at the outbreak of war, but when the Navy became convinced that delivery of the U-7 boats would be impossible, they were sold to Germany in November 1914.|$|E
5|$|Geothermal {{electric}} {{plants were}} traditionally built {{exclusively on the}} edges of tectonic plates where high temperature geothermal resources are available near the surface. The development of binary cycle power plants and improvements in drilling and extraction technology enable enhanced geothermal systems over a much greater geographical range. Demonstration projects are operational in Landau-Pfalz, Germany, and Soultz-sous-Forêts, France, while an earlier effort in Basel, Switzerland was shut down after it triggered earthquakes. Other demonstration projects are <b>under</b> <b>construction</b> <b>in</b> Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.|$|E
