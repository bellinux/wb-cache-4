Endotoxin did not alter the quantity of nitrogen excreted, {{compared with that of}} control mice, but in both groups of animals cortisone increased <b>urinary</b> <b>nitrogen</b> by the same amount. A balance between the quantity of protein catabolized (as estimated by increased <b>urinary</b> <b>nitrogen</b> excretion) and the total carbohydrate stored as a result of cortisone administration was found in fasted and in fed mice but not in endotoxin-poisoned mice. Endotoxin inhibited the motility of the gastrointestinal tract and blocked the absorption of food. Injections of ACTH in normal mice increased protein degradation and carbohydrate synthesis.

All available evidence points to the fact that endotoxin is responsible for this effect and that the quantity required is inversely proportional to the toxicity of the specific preparation employed. The underlying physiological basis for this action of endotoxin, however, remains obscure. In order to place the problem in clearer perspective, the following facts have been established: (a) Fasted female mice weighing about 20 gm excrete in an overnight period (17 hours) between 13 and 14 mg <b>urinary</b> <b>nitrogen.</b> This quantity is depressed slightly but not by a statistically significant amount following intraperitoneally administered endotoxin at dosage levels sublethal but toxic for mice (2).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Kidney {{function}} {{measured as}} estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) {{is a risk}} factor for mortality and severe diseases. Protein intake up-regulates kidney function. The dose-response curve of eGFR over protein intake is unknown. <b>Urinary</b> urea <b>nitrogen</b> is an objective index of protein intake. METHODS: The study cross-sectionally analysed the relation between overnight <b>urinary</b> urea <b>nitrogen</b> ((on) U-ureaN) and eGFR with and without control for other variables in 4106 adults of the Gubbio population. Analyses were done for serum creatinine (S-cr) also to investigate the independency of results from eGFR calculation. RESULTS: Higher (on) U-ureaN associated with higher eGFR, and lower S-cr independently of sex and age (simple and partial correlation coefficients > 0. 100, P 10. 12 mg/h, respectively). Multi-variable spline regression indicated that the relation of eGFR over (on) U-ureaN was non-significant for (on) U-ureaN 10. 12 mg/h (coefficient = + 0. 05, 95 % CI = - 0. 06 / + 0. 16, P = 0. 394). eGFR differed by ≈ 8 mL/min × 1. 73 m(2) between the lowest and highest 20 % of (on) U-ureaN distribution. CONCLUSIONS: Higher protein intake relates to higher eGFR.

For Holstein cows, the amount of urinary N excreted (g/d) was originally re-ported to be 12. 54 × MUN (mg/dl), but recently urinary N (g/d) was reported to equal 17. 64 × MUN (mg/dl). The objectives of the present study were to evaluate models to predict urinary N and expected MUN, by using older and newer data sets, and to quantify changes that may have occurred in MUN measurements over time. Two data sets were used for model evaluation. Data set 1 was from the spring of 1998 and data set 2 was from the spring of 1999. Similar cows and diets were used in both studies. By using data set 1, the newer model underestimated MUN by an average of 3. 8 mg/dl, whereas the older model was accurate. By using data set 2, the older model overestimated MUN by 4. 8 mg/ dl, but the newer model was accurate. In the period between the two studies, the MUN measured appeared to decrease by an average of 4. 0 mg/dl. By using current wet chemistry methods to analyze for MUN, urinary N (mg/dl) can be predicted as 0. 026 × MUN (mg/dl) × body weight (kg).

Four rats fed each level of protein were killed 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 days after they were divided into two groups. A study similar to that carried out on rats was conducted on six male college students who were living in the same unit of a cooking dormitory. Blood and urine samples were taken when they were eating a normal diet as a control and then they were adapted on a low protein dict providing 12 per cent of the calories as protein for two weeks. They were then switched to a high protein diet containing 30 per cent protein calories for four consecutive days. The rats fed the 40 per cent casein diet had a higher rate of weight gain and increased amounts of urine per 24 hours than the rats fed the 10 per cent casein diet. Urinary output of the human subjects on the diets containing 30 per cent protein calories was greater than when they received the 12 per cent protein calorie diet. There was a significant increase in total nitrogen and urea in serum and urine of rats and humans as the dietary protein level increased. The urinary excretion of uric acid, of creatinine in humans, and of <b>urinary</b> amino <b>nitrogen</b> and total serum protein in rats and humans were also increased appreciably as the protein intake increased. Ko significant effects or trends in serum amino nitrogen of humans, or serum creatinine in rats or humans were observed with the change in the level of dietary protein.

It was also found that there was a high negative correlation between serum uric acid and urinary uric acid of rats, and between serum amino <b>nitrogen</b> and <b>urinary</b> amino <b>nitrogen</b> of human subjects. This study indicates that the body rapidly adjusts to an altered level of protein intake by changing the level of nitrogenous components in blood and urine...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{observe the}} {{curative}} effects of alprostadil on diabetes nephropathy and its {{influences on the}} renal blood flow parameters and fibrosis indexes of patients. Methods: Eighty cases of patients with diabetic nephropathy who were treated in our hospital from May 2013 to September 2014 were randomly selected as the research objects and were divided into the control group and the observation group. Each group had 40 cases. Patients of the control group were treated by routine therapy, while patients of the observation group were treated with alprostadil {{on the basis of}} routine therapy. The fasting blood glucose, renal functionrelated indexes, serum creatinine, blood urea <b>nitrogen,</b> <b>urinary</b> albumin excretion rate and fibrosis markers, matrix metalloproteinase- 9 (MMP- 9), hyaluronic acid (HA), laminin (LN), Ⅲ procollagen (PC Ⅲ) and type Ⅳ collagen (ⅣC) of the two groups before and after treatments were respectively tested, and the peak systolic velocity (PSV), end diastolic velocity (EDV), resistance index (RI) and pulsatility index (PI) of renal artery segment were tested by color doppler ultrasound. Results: After 14 and 28 d of treatments, the blood urea <b>nitrogen,</b> <b>urinary</b> albumin excretion rate of the observation group were all significantly lower than those of the control group; the PSV and EDV were all significantly faster than those of the control group; RI and PI were all observably lower than those of the control group and the serum levels of MMP- 9, HA, LN, PC Ⅲ, and ⅣC were also prominently lower than those of the control group. Conclusions: Alprostadil can effectively slow the development of fibrosis and protect the renal function of patients with diabetic nephropathy by improving renal blood supply for them...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background High protein diet {{has been}} known to cause {{metabolic}} acidosis, which is manifested by increased <b>urinary</b> excretion of <b>nitrogen</b> and calcium. Bodybuilders habitually consumed excessive dietary protein over the amounts recommended for them to promote muscle mass accretion. This study investigated the metabolic response to high protein consumption in the elite bodybuilders. Methods Eight elite Korean bodybuilders within the age from 18 to 25, mean age 21. 5 ± 2. 6. For data collection, anthropometry, blood and urinary analysis, and dietary assessment were conducted. Results They consumed large amounts of protein (4. 3 ± 1. 2 g/kg BW/day) and calories (5, 621. 7 ± 1, 354. 7 kcal/day), as well as more than the recommended amounts of vitamins and minerals, including potassium and calcium. Serum creatinine (1. 3 ± 0. 1 mg/dl) and potassium (5. 9 ± 0. 8 mmol/L), and <b>urinary</b> urea <b>nitrogen</b> (24. 7 ± 9. 5 mg/dl) and creatinine (2. 3 ± 0. 7 mg/dl) were observed to be higher than the normal reference ranges. Urinary calcium (0. 3 ± 0. 1 mg/dl), and phosphorus (1. 3 ± 0. 4 mg/dl) were on the border of upper limit of the reference range and the urine pH was in normal range. Conclusions Increased urinary excretion of urea nitrogen and creatinine might be due to the high rates of protein metabolism that follow high protein intake and muscle turnover. The obvious evidence of metabolic acidosis in response to high protein diet in the subjects with high potassium intake and intensive resistance exercise were not shown in this study results. However, this study implied that resistance exercise with adequate mineral supplementation, such as potassium and calcium, could reduce or offset the negative effects of protein-generated metabolic changes. This study provides preliminary information of metabolic response to high protein intake in bodybuilders who engaged in high-intensity resistance exercise. Further studies will be needed {{to determine the effects of}} the intensity of exercise and the level of mineral intakes, especially potassium and calcium, which have a role to maintain acid-base homeostasis, on protein metabolism in large population of bodybuilders. </p...|$|R

40|$|Plasma somatomedin {{activity}} {{was measured in}} 12 patients who had sustained non-fatal musculo-skeletal injuries. It was depressed for 2 - 3 d after injury, but this depression bore no relationship to the catabolic response to injury which, as judged by <b>urinary</b> <b>nitrogen</b> excretion, was maximal at about one week. The depression of somatomedin activity may have been related to the high plasma cortisol concentrations observed {{during the first few}} days after injury. Plasma growth hormone concentrations were high acutely after injury but rapidly returned to normal. The changes in plasma somatomedin activity were thus unrelated to those in growth hormone, but were very similar to those in plasma insulin concentrations. A marked positive relationship was observed between plasma insulin concentrations and <b>urinary</b> <b>nitrogen</b> excretion, indicating unresponsiveness of protein metabolism to the normal anabolic effects of insulin. The study showed, however, that this was not as a result of low somatomedin activity...|$|E
40|$|Adult {{dogs were}} given a proteinless diet plus casein, 80 calories/kilo, 0. 4 gm. nitrogen/kilo/day. Sterile {{controlled}} inflammation was produced by subcutaneous injection of turpentine. The reaction is characterized by local swelling, induration, and abscess formation, terminated by rupture or incision after 3 to 5 days and by general reactions of malaise, fever, leucocytosis, and increased <b>urinary</b> <b>nitrogen.</b> For 3 to 6 days after turpentine the nitrogen intake was provided in seven experiments by amino acids given parenterally (a solution of the ten essential amino acids (Rose) plus glycine). A normal dog with a normal protein intake showed a negative nitrogen balance after turpentine—urinary nitrogen doubled even as in inflammation during fasting. A protein-depleted dog (low protein reserves produced by very low protein intake) given a normal protein intake after turpentine maintained nitrogen balance—urinary nitrogen rose only slightly. With a high (doubled) protein intake the depleted dog showed strongly positive balance. Normal dogs with high (doubled) protein intakes react to turpentine with doubled <b>urinary</b> <b>nitrogen</b> outputs on individual days and therefore are maintained in approximate nitrogen balance and weight balance. This end may be achieved equally well or better by oral feeding, when such is possible and absorption unimpaired. The increased nitrogen excretion after injury is again shown {{directly related to the}} state of body protein reserves. Increased catabolism not inhibition of anabolism best explains the excess <b>urinary</b> <b>nitrogen.</b> Protection during injury of valuable protein reserves appears possible through an adequate intake of protein nitrogen...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{glucagon}} deficiency and excess on plasma concentrations of 21 amino acids were studied in six normal human subjects for 8 h. During glucagon deficiency, produced by intravenous infusion of somatostatin (0. 5 mg/h) and insulin (5 mU/kg per h), amino acid concentration (sum of 21 amino acids) rose from 2, 607 +/- 76 to 2, 922 +/- 133 microM after 4 h (P less than 0. 025). The largest increases occurred in lysine (+ 26 %), glycine (+ 24 %), alanine (+ 23 %), and arginine (+ 23 %) concentrations. During glucagon excess produced by intravenous infusion of somatostatin (0. 5 mg/h), insulin (5 mU/kg per h), and glucagon (60 ng/kg per h), amino acid concentration decreased from 2, 774 +/- 166 to 2, 388 +/- 102 microM at 8 h (P less than 0. 01). The largest decreases occurred in citrulline (- 37 %), proline (- 32 %), ornithine (- 30 %), tyrosine (- 23 %), glycine (- 20 %), threonine (- 21 %), and alanine (18 %) concentrations. <b>Urinary</b> urea <b>nitrogen</b> and total nitrogen excretions were lower during glucagon deficiency than during glucagon excess (3. 1 +/- 0. 2 vs. 6. 3 +/- 2. 3 g/ 8 h, P less than 0. 05 and 4. 8 +/- 1. 0 vs 7. 0 +/- 2. 6 g/ 8 h, respectively, P less than 0. 05). Biostator-controlled euglycemic glucagon deficiency {{was produced in}} four normal subjects for 4 h to eliminate possible effects of changes in glucose concentration on amino acids. Amino acid concentration (sum of 18 amino acids) increases occurred in arginine (+ 42 %), alanine (+ 28 %), glutamine (+ 25 %), and glycine (+ 16 %) concentrations. The data show that small changes (- 66 pg/ml and + 50 pg/ml) in basal glucagon concentrations cause plasma amino acid concentrations to change in opposite directions. The finding that <b>urinary</b> excretion of <b>nitrogen</b> and urea nitrogen was greater during glucagon excess than during glucagon deficiency suggested alterations {{in the rate of}} gluconeogenesis from amino acids as one mechanism by which glucagon controls blood amino acid levels...|$|R
40|$|Milk urea {{nitrogen}} (MUN) {{concentration in}} dairy cows {{may serve as}} an on-farm indicator to guide nutritional strategies and to help reduce emissions of nitrogen (N) to the environment. Excretion of <b>urinary</b> urea <b>nitrogen</b> (UUN) is positively related to MUN, but the relationship is highly variable. The accuracy of MUN {{as a predictor of}} UUN may improve when various factors that affect this relationship can be taken into account. The current review discusses the impact of a number of UUN : MUN ratio influencing factors related to: physiological mechanisms in the dairy cow, farm management, differences between individual cows, nutrition and analysis methods for MUN. Factors related to variation in water intake, urine production, dietary protein level, body weight (BW) and time and frequency of feeding and milking are shown to affect MUN and its relationship with UUN. In addition, a number of factors are discussed that are likely to affect this relationship such as biological rhythm, renal reabsorption of urea during periods of protein deficiency and breeding value for MUN. Accounting for these above-mentioned factors in the relationship between MUN and UUN might substantially improve the applicability and accuracy of MUN as a predictor of protein utilization efficiency and UUN...|$|R
40|$|Aim. In this study, we {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the effects of febuxostat, a novel inhibitor of xanthine oxidase (XO), on renal damage in streptozotocin- (STZ-) induced diabetic rats. Methods. Diabetes was induced by the intraperitoneal injection of STZ in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Sham-injected rats served as controls. The control and diabetic rats were treated with and without febuxostat for 8 weeks, respectively. Fasting blood and 24 -h urine samples were collected every 4 weeks. Rat livers were extracted for detecting gene expression, content, and bioactivity of XO. Results. Diabetic rats showed significantly increased serum uric acid (SUA), serum creatinine (SCr), and urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. Daily urinary albumin (UAE), uric acid (UUA), and creatinine (UCr) excretion were also significantly increased in these rats. In diabetic rats, at week 8, febuxostat decreased SUA by 18. 9 %, while UAA was increased by 52. 0 %. However, UCr and <b>urinary</b> urea <b>nitrogen</b> (UUN) levels remained unchanged, while SCr and BUN levels decreased by > 30 % in these rats. Although hepatic gene expression, content, and activity of XO increased significantly in diabetic rats, febuxostat only slightly decreased its content. Conclusions. Febuxostat significantly attenuated renal damage in STZ-induced diabetic rats in addition to exerting hypouricemic effect...|$|R
