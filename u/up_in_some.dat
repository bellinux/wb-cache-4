5|$|According to Hobsbawm, the Fasci were a {{prime example}} of {{primitive}} agrarian movement that became modern by aligning itself with socialism and communism. Many of its leaders continued in the Socialist Party and continued the struggle for land rights and land reform once they were released. Despite the 1894 defeat, permanent movements were set <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> areas of Sicily using modern socialist models of organisation.|$|E
5|$|The {{climax of}} most Bond films {{is the final}} {{confrontation}} with the villain and his henchmen, sometimes an entire army of cohorts, often in his hard-to-reach lair. The villain's retreat can be a private island (Dr. No, The Man with the Golden Gun), underwater (The Spy Who Loved Me), mountaintop retreat (On Her Majesty's Secret Service, For Your Eyes Only) volcano (You Only Live Twice), or underground base (Live and Let Die), a ship (Thunderball, Tomorrow Never Dies), an oil rig (Diamonds Are Forever) or even a space station (Moonraker)â€”among other variations. Bond usually sabotages the lair and, with time ticking down, dispatches the supervillain, rescues the principal Bond girl and they escape as the place blows <b>up.</b> <b>In</b> <b>some</b> cases, the villain or his primary henchman escapes to launch a final attack on Bond and his lover in the final scene.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, {{possibly}} {{influenced by the}} minimalism of the International Style, a second renovation of the Sanctuary took place. The mid-20th-century renovation largely ignored the architectural history of the church. Louis Comfort Tiffany's paint and stenciling was obscured by a coat of light gray paint, and the purple Tiffany glass installed over the stained glass was removed. The oculus of the cupola was closed <b>up.</b> <b>In</b> <b>some</b> ways the removal of decoration recalled the congregation's Puritan roots.|$|E

25|$|In partial {{suspension}} {{the person}} is bound {{in a way that}} part of their body weight is held by suspension ropes, cables or chains.

A person lying on their upper back with legs tied upwards to a suspension point to pull their lower back off the ground would also qualify as partial suspension.|$|E
25|$|As is {{the case}} when moving APL {{programs}} from one vendor's APL interpreter to another, APL programs invariably will require changes to their content. Depending on the compiler, variable declarations might be needed, certain language features {{would need to be}} removed or avoided, or the APL programs would need to be cleaned <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> way. Some features of the language, such as the execute function (an expression evaluator) and the various reflection and introspection functions from APL, such as the ability to return a function's text or to materialize a new function from text, are simply not practical to implement in machine code compilation.|$|E

25|$|On February 8, the Iraqi Army recaptured the Juwaybah District, to {{the east}} of Ramadi, east of the Sajjariyah District. On February 9, Iraqi forces entered the center of Husaiybah, the last ISIL-held village {{to the east}} of Ramadi. Later on the same day, the Iraqi Army fully recaptured the Husaiybah Al-Sharqiyah District, about 10 {{kilometers}} (6 miles) east of Ramadi, thus fully expelling ISIL from the environs of Ramadi. Dozens of ISIL militants were killed in the clashes in Husaiybah. The Iraqi Army also began evacuating 1,500 civilians from the Husaiybah Al-Sharqiyah District. Afterwards, the Iraqi Government reopened the Ramadi-Habbaniyah Highway. ISIL militants were still holed <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> farmlands in Khalidiya Island, {{to the north of the}} town of Al Khalidiya. On February 10, it was reported that the Iraqi Army had fully recaptured the Khalidiya District, including the Khalidiya Island area, but there was renewed fighting in Khalidiya Island area since March 2016. Because there was still resistance in the area, the army started a new offensive on May 25, 2016.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} many {{instances}} showing {{that there is a}} form of aphasia among deaf individuals. Sign language is, after all, a form of communication that has been shown to use the same areas of the brain as verbal forms of communication. Mirror neurons become activated when an animal is acting in a particular way or watching another individual act in the same manner. These mirror neurons are important in giving an individual the ability to mimic movements of hands. Broca's area of speech production has been shown to contain several of these mirror neurons resulting in significant similarities of brain activity between sign language and vocal speech communication. Facial communication is a significant portion of how animals interact with each other. Humans use facial movements to create, what other humans perceive, to be faces of emotions. While combining these facial movements with speech, a more full form of language is created which enables the species to interact with a much more complex and detailed form of communication. Sign language also uses these facial movements and emotions along with the primary hand movement way of communicating. These facial movement forms of communication come from the same areas of the brain. When dealing with damages to certain areas of the brain, vocal forms of communication are in jeopardy of severe forms of aphasia. Since these same areas of the brain are being used for sign language, these same, at least very similar, forms of aphasia can show in the Deaf community. Individuals can show a form of Wernicke's aphasia with sign language and they show deficits in their abilities in being able to produce any form of expressions. Broca's aphasia shows <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> patients, as well. These individuals find tremendous difficulty in being able to actually sign the linguistic concepts they are trying to express.|$|E

Highsmith had suggested to Nagy she adapt one of her novels.

500|$|The {{problem with}} metaphysical realism, {{according}} to Putnam, {{was that it}} fails to explain the possibility of reference and truth. According to the metaphysical realist, our concepts and categories refer because they match <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> mysterious manner with the pre-structured categories, kinds and individuals that are inherent in the external world. But {{how is it possible}} that the world [...] "carves up" [...] into certain structures and categories, the mind carves up the world into its own categories and structures, and the two [...] "carvings" [...] perfectly coincide? The answer must be that the world does not come pre-structured but that structure must be imposed on it by the human mind and its conceptual schemes. [...] In Reason, Truth, and History, Putnam identified truth with what he termed [...] "idealized rational acceptability." [...] The theory, which owes something to C. S. Peirce, is that a belief is true if it would be accepted by anyone under ideal epistemic conditions.|$|E
