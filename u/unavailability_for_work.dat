40|$|Background: This study tests whether depression, psychosocial adversity, {{and limited}} social assets offer {{protection}} or suggest vulnerability {{to the process}} of radicalisation. Methods: A population sample of 608 men and women of Pakistani or Bangladeshi origin, of Muslim heritage, and aged 18 â€“ 45 were recruited by quota sampling. Radicalisation was measured by 16 questions asking about sympathies for violent protest and terrorism. Cluster analysis of the 16 items generated three groups: most sympathetic (or most vulnerable), most condemning (most resistant), and a large intermediary group that acted as a reference group. Associations were calculated with depression (PHQ 9), anxiety (GAD 7), poor health, and psychosocial adversity (adverse life events, perceived discrimination, unemployment). We also investigated protective factors such as the number social contacts, social capital (trust, satisfaction, feeling safe), political engagement and religiosity. Results: Those showing the most sympathy for violent protest and terrorism {{were more likely to report}} depression (PHQ 9 score of 5 or more; RR = 5. 43, 1. 35 to 21. 84) and to report religion to be important (less often said religion was fairly rather than very important; RR = 0. 08, 0. 01 to 0. 48). Resistance to radicalisation measured by condemnation of violent protest and terrorism was associated with larger number of social contacts (per contact: RR = 1. 52, 1. 26 to 1. 83), less social capital (RR = 0. 63, 0. 50 to 0. 80), <b>unavailability</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> due to housekeeping or disability (RR = 8. 81, 1. 06 to 37. 46), and not bein...|$|E
40|$|The Thesis {{seeks to}} make a {{contribution}} to our current understanding of the complex relationship between higher education and the graduate labour market in the UK on both a methodological and policy level. Using administrative data from the Universities' Statistical Record (USR) on complete cohorts of individual students who left university between 1980 and 1993, the Thesis develops along three main avenues: i) identifying the key determinants of graduates' first destinations (Chapters 2 and 3); ii) comparing alternative indicators of employment-related university performance and assessing their robustness to data aggregation (Chapter 4); iii) estimating the differences in graduates' occupational earnings by degree subject (Chapter 5). The study on first destination considers a broad range of possible outcomes distinguishing between temporary and permanent as well as 'graduate' and 'nongraduate' employment, professional training and postgraduate study, involuntary unemployment and <b>unavailability</b> <b>for</b> <b>work.</b> The analysis reveals significant effects on graduates' employability associated with gender, university type, degree subject, degree class, socio-economic background, and prior qualifications (Chapter 2). Moreover, the impact of all the main factors affecting graduates' early careers has a significant correlation with the business cycle (Chapter 3). In Chapter 4 we compare employment-related university performance indicators constructed from student-level and university-level data, respectively. Despite student-level data on university statistics now being publicly available, institutions are currently assessed according to indicators based on university-level data, implicitly obtained by averaging over individuals the corresponding student-level information. We find {{significant differences between the two}} sets of indicators and argue that the observed discrepancies are the result of an aggregation bias. A Monte Carlo experiment is used to test the validity of this conclusion. Finally, Chapter 5 looks at the differences of graduates' occupational earnings by degree subject using USR and NES data from 1980 to 1993. We discuss the issue of self-selection of students into the subject of study and apply three alternative modelling strategies to control for self-selection: the proxy and matching method, propensity score matching and a simultaneous equations model accounting for 'selection on unobservables'. The evidence suggests the presence of a significant selection bias originating from the unaccounted correlation between unobservable individual characteristics affecting both occupational earnings and subject choice. Moreover, the ranking of university subjects changes over time. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceEconomic and Social Research Council (Great Britain) (ESRC) GBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
50|$|Meares' {{resignation}} {{from the}} expedition and <b>unavailability</b> <b>for</b> further <b>work</b> on the barrier resulted in plans being changed, and Scott complicated {{the situation by}} taking the dogs much further on the polar journey than had been originally planned, so {{that they were not}} back at base until 5 January: the dogs' second barrier journey was never made, and although the minimum 3 XS rations were duly depoted (by a man-hauling party comprising Day, Hooper, Clissold and Nelson), the dog food never was. This may have been due to an oversight, a misunderstanding, a lack of communication, disobedience, or so as not to exhaust the men: the supplies were intended to be transported by dogs (see below). The significance of this omission was only apparent later - it meant that any future movement of the dogs south of One Ton, for rescue purposes or otherwise, would be problematic. While the omission of two XS rations was less significant than that of the dog food (in the end it was of no significance at all: the polar party never reached One Ton) it did change the purpose of the final journey, in that it was now required to transport these rations, rather than simply aid the party's return.|$|R

40|$|A {{survey was}} carried out among 60 farmers who were plowing with Nguni cows in Chokwe District in Gaza, Mozambique in July 1994. The {{histories}} of 110 cows raised primarily for breeding purposes but used also for traction {{were obtained from the}} owners. Calving intervals averaged 21 months and calving occurred throughout the year but peaked in the rains. Calf mortality from birth to weaning was not recorded but there was evidence of abortions and weakened calves in two villages. These levels were equal to those obtained in the years with sufficient male animals for traction in the region and use of cows for this purpose was probably uncommon. They were also similar to those obtained in non-draft Nguni cows in better management situations on-station. Despite these positive results, using cow traction is apparently a temporary practice due to a shortage of cattle following drought and war. The main problem mentioned by farmers was the <b>unavailability</b> of cows <b>for</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> up to four months each year during calving...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, {{we study}} the {{unavailability}} analysis {{of three different}} configurations with warm standby units in {{two different types of}} tandem repair queue, i. e. G-M type and M-G type. The G-M type is that the repair time of the first station (G-station) is general distribution and of the second station is exponential distribution. The M-G type, on the contrary, is that the repair time of the first station is exponential distribution and of the second station (G-station) is general distribution. The breakdown times of the primary and standby units are assumed to be exponentially distributed. We provide a systematic matrix method, using supplementary variable technique to develop the steady-state <b>unavailability</b> (UAV) <b>for</b> three configurations. For each configuration, we present some explicit expressions of the UAV for four various repair time distributions for the G-station which are exponential, gamma, uniform and deterministic. We also study the impact of the order of the two repair stations and the effects of various system parameters on the UAV. 1 	Introductionâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦. 1 1. 1 	Problem statementâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦ [...] 2 1. 2 	Literature reviewâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦ 3 1. 3 	Scope of the studyâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦ [...] 4 2 	Unavailability analysis of the systemâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦. â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦ 5 2. 1 	Calculation for configuration 1 â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦ [...] 5 2. 1. 1 <b>Unavailability</b> <b>for</b> configuration 1 â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦ [...] . 5 2. 2 	Calculation for configuration 2 â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦ [...] 8 2. 2. 1 <b>Unavailability</b> <b>for</b> configuration 2 â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦. â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦ [...] 8 2. 2. 2 Special casesâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦ [...] 13 2. 3 	Calculation for configuration 3 â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦ 14 2. 3. 1 <b>Unavailability</b> <b>for</b> configuration 3 â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦. 14 3 	Comparisons of three configurationsâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦. 22 3. 1 	Comparison of three configurations under M-G typeâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦ [...] 22 3. 2 	Analysis of the UAV of two configurations under G-M and M-G types. â€¦. 29 4 	Conclusions and future researchâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦ [...] . 32 4. 1 	Conclusionsâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦ [...] 32 4. 2 	Future researchâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦ [...] . â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦ [...] 3...|$|R
