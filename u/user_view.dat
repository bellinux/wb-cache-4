40|$|While recent advancements {{in virtual}} reality {{technology}} {{have created a}} rich communication interface linking humans and computers, {{there has been little}} work on building dialogue systems for 3 D virtual worlds. This paper proposes a method for altering the instruction dialogue to match the <b>user's</b> <b>view</b> in a virtual environment. We illustrate the method with the system MID- 3 D, which interactively instructs the user on dismantling some parts of a car. First, in order to change the content of the instruction dialogue to match the <b>user's</b> <b>view,</b> we extend the re#nement-driven planning algorithm by using the <b>user's</b> <b>view</b> as a plan constraint. Second, to manage the dialogue smoothly, the system keeps track of the user's viewpoint as part of the dialogue state and uses this information for coping with interruptive subdialogues. These mechanisms enable MID- 3 D to set instruction dialogues in an incremental way# it takes account of the <b>user's</b> <b>view</b> even when it changes frequently. 1 Introduction In a [...] ...|$|R

View modeling involves the modeling of the <b>user</b> <b>views</b> using a conceptual/semantic data model; the view integration phase merqes <b>user</b> <b>views</b> into a global model which is then mapped to an existing database environment and subsequently optimized. Here we use the data model proposed by Navathe and Schkolnick to model <b>user</b> <b>views</b> and develop a methodo 1 og. y for view integration.

Modifications at the logical level are necessary whenever the logical structure of the database is altered (for example, when money-market accounts are added to banking system). Logical Data independence means if we add some new columns or remove some columns from table then the <b>user</b> <b>view</b> and programs should not change. For example: consider two users A & B. Both are selecting the fields [...] "EmployeeNumber" [...] and [...] "EmployeeName". If user B adds a new column (e.g. salary) to his table, it will not effect the external view for user A, though the internal schema of the database has been changed for both users A & B.|$|E

5000|$|Over the years, {{the skill}} and {{interest}} in building information systems has grown tremendously. However, for the most part, the traditional approach to building systems has only focused on defining data from two distinct views, the [...] "user view" [...] and the [...] "computer view". From the <b>user</b> <b>view,</b> which will {{be referred to as}} the “external schema,” the definition of data is in the context of reports and screens designed to aid individuals in doing their specific jobs.

The required structure of data for computer storage depends upon the specific computer technology employed and the need for efficient processing of data.|$|E
50|$|The third IDEF (IDEF2) was {{originally}} {{intended as a}} user interface modeling method. However, since the Integrated Computer-Aided Manufacturing (ICAM) Program needed a simulation modeling tool, the resulting IDEF2 was a method for representing the time varying behavior of resources in a manufacturing system, providing a framework for specification of math model based simulations. It was {{the intent of the}} methodology program within ICAM to rectify this situation but limitation of funding did not allow this to happen. As a result, the lack of a method which would support the structuring of descriptions of the <b>user</b> <b>view</b> of a system has been a major shortcoming of the IDEF system. The basic problem from a methodology point of view is the need to distinguish between a description of what a system (existing or proposed) is supposed to do and a representative simulation model that will predict what a system will do. The latter was the focus of IDEF2, the former is the focus of IDEF3.|$|E
