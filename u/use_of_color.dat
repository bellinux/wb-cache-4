5|$|While melding the {{elements}} and motifs of panels from two artists, Lichtenstein simplified the hatching and <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>color.</b> In Lichtenstein's obituary, Los Angeles Times critic Christopher Knight said the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>color</b> {{in this work}} harkened back to works by Morris Louis and the explosion's graphic elements recalled Kenneth Noland's target work.|$|E
5|$|Lazzell's {{paintings}} {{demonstrated a}} rich and nuanced <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>color.</b> She preferred French watercolor pigments that, alongside {{the grain of the}} woodblocks, created embossed lines and striated patterns. Typically the woodblocks she created were made from cherry or basswood and she only pulled three or four prints from each woodblock. From 1916 to 1955, Lazzell created 138 woodblocks. Modern exhibitions of Lazzell's artworks have included the woodblocks themselves.|$|E

5|$|Hafted {{tools are}} further {{representative}} of human innovation. The large cutting {{tools of the}} Acheulian technocomplex become smaller, as more complex tools are better suited towards the needs of highly diversified environments. Composite tools represent {{a new level of}} innovation in their increased efficacy and more complex manufacturing process. The ability to conceptualize beyond the mere reduction of stone cores demonstrates cognitive flexibility, and the use of glue, which was often processed with ochre, to attach flakes to hafts demonstrates an understanding of chemical changes that can be utilized beyond the simple <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>color.</b> Adhesives were used to construct hafted tools by 70ka at Sibudu Cave in South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Manhunter {{focuses on}} the {{forensic}} work {{carried out by the}} FBI to track down killers and shows the long-term effects that cases like this have on profilers such as Graham, highlighting the similarities between him and his quarry. The film features heavily stylized <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>color</b> to convey this sense of duality, {{and the nature of the}} characters' similarity has been explored in academic readings of the film. It was the first film adaptation of Harris' Hannibal Lecter novels, as well as the first adaptation of Red Dragon, which later became the basis for a film of the same name in 2002.|$|E

5|$|The {{starting}} point for the script was the ensemble cast of friends and previous collaborators Jarmusch had conceived characters for, while the tripartite formal structure of the film was inspired by his study of literary forms. Cinematographer Robby Müller and musician John Lurie were among the many contributors who had been involved in earlier Jarmusch projects and returned to work on the film. Mystery Trains US$2.8 million budget (financed by Japanese conglomerate JVC) was considerable compared to what the director had enjoyed before, and allowed him the freedom to rehearse many unscripted background scenes. It was the first of Jarmusch's feature films to depart from his trademark black-and-white photography, though the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>color</b> was tightly controlled to conform with the director's intuitive sense of the film's aesthetic.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, South Korea's film {{industry}} {{was at a}} low point due to government censorship and underfunding. Because of the poor state of the local {{film industry}}, cinema attendance in South Korea had dropped drastically since its high-point in the 1960s. Kim Ki-young, however, working independently in B-movie-like genre films, began to produce {{some of his most}} innovative and personal works at this time. Kim fully regained his auteurist spirit with Woman of Fire (1971), the second of his Housemaid trilogy. The <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>color,</b> particularly reds and blues to express the anxiety and desires of the film's characters, distinguished this film from the original Housemaids dark, shadowy black-and-white photography. For this film, Kim was named Best Director at the Blue Dragon Film Awards and actress Youn Yuh-jung was given Special Mention for Best Actress at the Festival de Cine de Sitges. Not only popular with the critics, Kim's independently produced films were box-office successes during this era in which most films were harmed through heavy governmental interference. In 1972 Kim's Insect Woman was the only film to sell more than 100,000 tickets in Seoul and won Kim the Best Director prize at the Baeksang Arts Awards in 1973.|$|E
