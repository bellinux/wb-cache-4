5|$|Germany regained {{control of}} the Saarland through a {{referendum}} held in 1935 and annexed Austria in the Anschluss of 1938. The Munich Agreement of 1938 gave Germany {{control of the}} Sudetenland and they seized the remainder of Czechoslovakia six months later. <b>Under</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> invasion by sea, Lithuania surrendered the Memel district in March 1939.|$|E
5|$|On September 1, the Japan Meteorological Agency {{ordered the}} {{temporary}} evacuation of its staff on Minami-Tori-shima, <b>under</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> the typhoon.

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} attack on Broome, Winckel was sent {{on a mission to}} Bandung, Java, to recover several {{officers}} from the Allied headquarters, which was <b>under</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> being overrun. He served the remainder of the war with No. 18 (Netherlands East Indies) Squadron RAAF in Australia. After World War II, he fought in the Dutch Politionele acties.|$|E

5|$|A {{prophylactic}} method introduced {{after the}} North Sea Flood of 1953 is {{the construction of}} dams and storm-surge barriers (flood barriers). They are open and allow free passage, but close when the land is <b>under</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> a storm surge. Major storm surge barriers are the Oosterscheldekering and Maeslantkering in the Netherlands, which {{are part of the}} Delta Works project; the Thames Barrier protecting London; and the Saint Petersburg Dam in Russia.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, {{following}} the Second World War's Battle of France, the United Kingdom was <b>under</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> invasion from Germany. During the summer, the Battle of Britain dampened this threat. As the year progressed, {{the size of}} the British Army increased dramatically as 140 new infantry battalions were raised. During October, with the possibility of a German invasion during 1941, these new battalions were formed into independent infantry brigades that were then assigned to newly created County Divisions.|$|E

In spite of overt racism from at least one instructor and several classmates at this posting, Brown completed the rigorous training in August 1947.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} stages of the Second World War {{following}} the Battle of France in 1940, the United Kingdom was <b>under</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> invasion from Germany but during the summer, the Battle of Britain dampened this threat. As the year progressed, the size of the British Army increased dramatically as 140 new infantry battalions were raised. In late 1940, with the possibility of a German invasion during 1941, these new battalions were formed into independent infantry brigades that were then loaned to newly created County Divisions.|$|E
5|$|Lee gave strict {{orders for}} his army to {{minimize}} any negative {{impacts on the}} civilian population. Food, horses, and other supplies were generally not seized outright, although quartermasters reimbursing Northern farmers and merchants with Confederate money were not well received. Various towns, most notably York, Pennsylvania, were required to pay indemnities in lieu of supplies, <b>under</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> destruction. During the invasion, the Confederates seized some 40 northern African Americans. A few of them were escaped fugitive slaves, but most were freemen; all were sent south into slavery under guard.|$|E

5|$|The Dzordzor Chapel {{was built}} {{on the bank of the}} Makuchay River at Dzordzor by Bishop Zachariah in 1314 on very modest lines, making use of the vestiges of an earlier {{religious}} monument dated between the 10th and 12th centuries. During the period of Ottoman rule, some parts of the building were destroyed. Later, the chapel came <b>under</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> submergence from a proposed dam and had to be shifted to a new location upstream.|$|E
5|$|What {{had begun}} as a Salt Satyagraha quickly {{grew into a}} mass Satyagraha. British cloth and goods were boycotted. Unpopular forest laws were defied in the Maharashtra, Karnataka and Central Provinces. Gujarati peasants refused to pay tax, <b>under</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> losing their crops and land. In Midnapore, Bengalis took part by refusing to pay the chowkidar tax. The British responded with more laws, {{including}} censorship of correspondence and declaring the Congress and its associate organisations illegal. None of those measures slowed the civil disobedience movement.|$|E
5|$|With {{forest fires}} {{continuing}} to burn in neighboring Indonesia, heavy smog {{was a concern}} for the event. Unhealthy levels forced the cancellation of other events in Singapore in the week leading up to the Grand Prix. Race organisers, however, did not speculate whether the Grand Prix was also <b>under</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> cancellation. It was later reported that the smog had lifted and that the race could go ahead without any restrictions.|$|E
30|$|Cotton {{production}} in Uzbekistan {{has a long}} agricultural history and farmers are experienced in producing it. Because of land reforms which occurred after achieving independence in 1991 and <b>under</b> <b>threats</b> <b>of</b> increasing water scarcity {{and a reduction in}} the fertility of farmlands, the efficient resource use has become an important issue in public discussions and a worthy research topic.|$|R

5|$|In {{a general}} peace conference at Sparta, the Spartans, with their {{authority}} {{enhanced by the}} threat of Persian intervention, secured the acquiescence of all the major states of Greece to these terms. The agreement eventually produced was commonly known as the King's Peace, reflecting the Persian influence the treaty showed. This treaty marked the first attempt at a Common Peace in Greek history; under the treaty, all cities were to be independent, a clause that would be enforced by the Spartans as guardians of the peace. <b>Under</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> Spartan intervention, Thebes disbanded its league, and Argos and Corinth ended their experiment in shared government; Corinth, deprived of its strong ally, was incorporated back into Sparta's Peloponnesian League. After 8 years of fighting, the Corinthian war was at an end.|$|E
5|$|Jones himself came <b>under</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> {{transfer}} or subordination in April 1943 {{when the}} Federal government began moves {{to unite the}} Air Force's command by creating an overarching Air Officer Commanding RAAF position that would have effectively replaced Jones as CAS and also been senior to Bostock. Air Marshal Drummond was again approached but once more the British Air Ministry refused to release him, having selected him for an Air Council post. MacArthur rejected two other RAF candidates, and the plan was held over. In the King's Birthday Honours that June, Jones was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath.|$|E
5|$|On 24 November, {{some of the}} French ships {{traveled}} to Tangier, where they picked up Consul Julius Doazan and his secretary, Fleurat, on Narval. Later that evening, Caton reached Salé and offered safe passage to Rabat for the British consul Elton and his family, {{in anticipation of the}} bombardment of the city. The following day, at 11:00a.m., Caton anchored between the cities of Rabat and Salé. Its commander demanded an apology over the thefts and raids and immediate repayment for the stolen goods, <b>under</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> bombardment. The rais in the ports of both cities promised to answer to the French demands within three hours. Two hours later, all of the French ships had reached the mouth of the Bou Regreg, between Rabat and Salé.|$|E

5|$|Parliament met in February 1308 in {{a heated}} atmosphere. Edward was eager to discuss the {{potential}} for governmental reform, but the barons were unwilling to begin any such debate until the problem of Gaveston had been resolved. Violence seemed likely, but the situation was resolved through the mediation of the moderate Henry de Lacy, the Earl of Lincoln, who convinced the barons to back down. A fresh parliament was held in April, where the barons once again criticised Gaveston, demanding his exile, this time supported by Isabella and the French monarchy. Edward resisted, but finally acquiesced, agreeing to send Gaveston to Aquitaine, <b>under</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> excommunication by the Archbishop of Canterbury should he return. At the last moment, Edward {{changed his mind and}} instead sent Gaveston to Dublin, appointing him as the Lieutenant of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} by Cascade Games founded in 1983 by Guy Wilhelmy and Nigel Stevens. Wilhelmy had a pilot's license and had experience with aircraft control and responsiveness, while Stevens' father had been in British Royal Air Force. Wilhelmy explained {{that he wanted to}} create a fast-paced flying game with responsive graphics that other games of the time struggled with. Cascade hired programmer Ian Martin and graphics designer Damon Redmond to work on the project in 1985. The first version known as A.C.E.: Air Combat Emulator was released in 1985 for the Commodore 16 and VIC-20 home computers. Martin describes that an advertisement erroneously promising a Plus/4 version forced them to develop it <b>under</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> action by Advertising Standards Agency.|$|E
5|$|By 1981, Gary's wife, {{and then}} Gary himself, had both {{committed}} suicide. At the same time, Hollywood was <b>under</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> strikes {{by both the}} Writers's and Directors's Guilds. Needing enough films to carry the studio through in case the strikes happened, White Dog was one of thirteen films considered to be far enough along to be completable {{in a short time}} frame. With a push from Michael Eisner, White Dog was one of seven that Paramount put on a fast track for production. Eisner pushed for the film {{to be one of the}} selected ones because of its social message that hate was learned. Producer Jon Davison was less certain and, early on, he questioned how the film was being marketed. Hanson, back on board as the film's screenwriter, suggested that Samuel Fuller be named the film's director as he felt Fuller was the only one available with the experience needed to complete the film on such a short schedule and with a low budget, while still doing so responsibly with regard to the sensitive material. Davison agreed after visiting Fuller and seeing Fuller act out how he would shoot the film.|$|E

5000|$|Media {{reports were}} mixed on the Committee of 100. Many delegates {{received}} {{the opportunity to}} tell their stories for the first time, publicly challenging those in power (who typically enjoyed automatic access to the media).

Mahon suggested that the Committee would be mostly ignored because Congress could not [...] "legislate <b>under</b> <b>threats</b> <b>of</b> violence.|$|R
