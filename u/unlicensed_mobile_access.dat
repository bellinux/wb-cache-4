40|$|One of the {{advantages}} of <b>mobile</b> <b>access</b> to the Internet can be found in that it allows one to conduct information search in a ubiquitous manner. Accordingly, the time for net surfing required to gain necessary information through the Internet is reduced when <b>mobile</b> <b>access</b> is combined with ordi-nary PC <b>access.</b> As <b>mobile</b> devices continue to advance rapidly, it becomes quite important {{to find a way to}} assess the impact of <b>mobile</b> <b>access</b> to the Internet on the performance of e-commerce. Among such performance indi-cators, of particular interest is the conversion rate, where a customer takes some desirable action at the website, for example, by becoming a member, placing an order and so on. The purpose of this paper is to develop and analyze a mathematical model for describing the information search pro-cess through the Internet with or without the <b>mobile</b> <b>access.</b> The analytical framework that we propose in this article enables one to assess the impact of <b>mobile</b> <b>access</b> on information search completion time and the conversion rate. We provide numerical examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the computational procedures that we developed in this research.

50|$|Most major {{backers of}} LTE {{preferred}} and promoted VoLTE from the beginning. The lack of software support in initial LTE devices {{as well as}} core network devices however led {{to a number of}} carriers promoting VoLGA (Voice over LTE Generic Access) as an interim solution. The idea was to use the same principles as GAN (Generic Access Network, also known as UMA or <b>Unlicensed</b> <b>Mobile</b> <b>Access),</b> which defines the protocols through which a mobile handset can perform voice calls over a customer's private Internet connection, usually over wireless LAN. VoLGA however never gained much support, because VoLTE (IMS) promises much more flexible services, albeit at the cost of having to upgrade the entire voice call infrastructure. VoLTE will also require Single Radio Voice Call Continuity (SRVCC) {{in order to be able}} to smoothly perform a handover to a 3G network in case of poor LTE signal quality.|$|E
