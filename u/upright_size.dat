25|$|A small African ape living around 6Ma was {{the last}} animal whose {{descendants}} would include both modern humans and their closest relatives, the chimpanzees. Only two branches of its family tree have surviving descendants. Very soon after the split, {{for reasons that are}} still unclear, apes in one branch developed the ability to walk <b>upright.</b> Brain <b>size</b> increased rapidly, and by 2Ma, the first animals classified in the genus Homo had appeared. Of course, the line between different species or even genera is somewhat arbitrary as organisms continuously change over generations. Around the same time, the other branch split into the ancestors of the common chimpanzee and the ancestors of the bonobo as evolution continued simultaneously in all life forms.|$|R

Early settlers had even removed the easily accessible stones from the chimney.

The walls, of hand-hewn native timber, follow the exact alignment of the originals, and all supporting <b>uprights</b> are <b>sized</b> to match the originals and are reset in the original postholes.

5000|$|The {{obstetrical}} {{dilemma is}} a hypothesis {{to explain why}} humans often require assistance from other humans during childbirth to avoid complications, whereas most non-human primates give birth alone with relatively little difficulty. The obstetrical dilemma posits that {{this is due to}} the biological constraints imposed by two opposing evolutionary pressures in the development of the human pelvis. As human ancestor species (hominids) developed bipedal locomotion (the ability to walk <b>upright),</b> decreasing the <b>size</b> of the bony birth canal, they also developed ever larger skulls, which required a wider obstetrical pelvic area to accommodate this trend in hominid infants.|$|R
5000|$|Upright frames (also called upright columns or <b>uprights)</b> vary in <b>size</b> {{and design}} {{depending}} on load requirements, and styles.

Holes or slots are punched during manufacturing up and down the column at standard intervals so that the load beams can be mounted into the upright columns. Upright frames can also be constructed utilizing structural C shapes for columns. Structural uprights have an increased weight capacity over roll formed uprights.|$|R
50|$|By 1969, Kimball had {{returned}} to its former position as the world's largest piano maker. The subsidiary made some 100,000 pianos and organs annually during its peak years in the 1960s and 1970s. An average day saw 250 pianos and 150 electronic organs shipped from the factory. Grand pianos from Kimball in Indiana ranged from compact 4 ft models to larger 6 ft models. In Vienna, the Bösendorfer division made concert grand pianos as large as 9 ft: the Imperial Bösendorfer. Kimball also made upright pianos in 42 in and 46 in sizes, but not smaller spinet models; a decision which allowed great profits {{to be made by}} competitors. However, Kimball produced inexpensive console pianos, between <b>upright</b> and spinet <b>size,</b> in a subsidiary plant across the Texas-Mexico border in Reynosa, doing business as Kimco.|$|R

40|$|Here, {{we present}} a {{comprehensive}} dataset on the scaling of musculoskeletal architecture in varanids, providing information about the phylogenetically constrained adaptations that allow functional diversification across locomotor muscles in sprawling tetrapods. The effects of size and the fundamental selective pressures associated with it has been recognized for nearly 4 centuries. If animals were geometrically scaled up versions of themselves, increases in body size would result {{in an increase in}} musculoskeletal stresses, a result of the geometric scaling of mass and area. This becomes a problem for large animals, where stresses come dangerously close to failure points. In this study, we quantified the architectural properties of 22 lower limb muscles in 27 individuals from 9 species of varanid lizards (from 7. 6 g Varanus brevicauda to 40000 g Varanus komodoensis). Results suggest that larger varanids increase the relative force-generating capacity of the femur abductors and adductors, and ankle extensors with greater scaling exponents than geometric similarity predicts for muscle mass, PCSA or pennation. In addition, muscle mass in the swing phase knee flexors scale with values > M 1, which may reflect additional muscle mass required to move a heavier limb. Thus varanids mitigate the size-related increases in stress by increasing muscle mass and PCSA rather than adopting a more <b>upright</b> posture with <b>size</b> as shown in other animals...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{functional}} design of skeletal muscles {{is shaped by}} conflicting selective pressures between support and propulsion, which becomes even more important as animals get larger. If larger animals were geometrically scaled up versions of smaller animals, increases in body size would cause an increase in musculoskeletal stress, {{a result of the}} greater scaling of mass in comparison to area. In large animals these stresses would come dangerously close to points of failure. By examining the architecture of 22 hindlimb muscles in 27 individuals from 9 species of varanid lizards ranging from the tiny 7. 6 g Varanus brevicauda to the giant 40 kg Varanus komodoensis, we present a comprehensive dataset on the scaling of musculoskeletal architecture in monitor lizards (varanids), providing information about the phylogenetic constraints and adaptations of locomotor muscles in sprawling tetrapods. Results: Scaling results for muscle mass, pennation and physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA), all suggest that larger varanids increase the relative force-generating capacity of femur adductors, knee flexors and ankle plantarflexors, with scaling exponents greater than geometric similarity predicts. Thus varanids mitigate the size-related increases in stress by increasing muscle mass and PCSA rather than adopting a more <b>upright</b> posture with <b>size</b> as is shown in other animals. As well as the scaling effects of muscle properties with body mass, the variation in muscle architecture with changes in hindlimb posture were also prominent. Within varanids, posture varies with habitat preference. Climbing lizards display a sprawling posture while terrestrial lizards display a more upright posture. Sprawling species required larger PCSAs and muscle masses in femur retractors, knee flexors, and ankle plantarflexors in order to support the body. Conclusions: Both size and posture-related muscle changes all suggest an increased role in support over propulsion, leading to a decrease in locomotor performance which has previously been shown with increases in size. These estimates suggest the giant Pleistocene varanid lizard (Varanus megalania priscus) would likely {{not have been able to}} outrun early humans with which it co-habitated the Australian landmass with...|$|R
40|$|Almond, Prunus dulcis, is a {{tree nut}} crop that {{originated}} in central Asia {{and is now}} grown commercially worldwide. Within Australia there exists huge potential gain from optimisation of almond cultivars better suited to Australian conditions. This is {{the ultimate goal of}} the Australian Almond Breeding Program, which was established in 1997 at the University of Adelaide. As part of this breeding program a unique hybrid population was developed from a cross between the American self-incompatible cultivar 'Nonpareil' (NP) and European self-compatible cultivar 'Lauranne' (LA). The F₁ population derived from this cross is the focus of this study, the population consisted of 181 individuals, of which 93 were selected for use in the mapping study. Investigation of a number of DNA extraction techniques was performed in order to optimise DNA extraction quality and integrity from almond leaves for future applications in molecular work. To determine if the purported F₁ hybrids were true hybrids, derived from a cross between the cultivars NP and LA, both DNA fingerprinting with cluster analysis and S-allele identification was performed, and the majority of F₁ putative hybrids clustered between the two parents when analysed using the simple matching coefficient and UPGMA. The genetic similarity between individuals comprising the mapping population ranged from 70 % to 93 % while the parents were 72 % similar in comparison to each other. This indicated high genetic variability available for studying heritabilities and for production of a genetic map. Analysing the S-allele complement of all the F₁ hybrids was also performed to offer a more robust method for hybrid determination, since individuals in a breeding population with aberrant S-allele inheritance can be considered non-related. The inheritance of the self-fertility gene is important in breeding programs, since the majority of almond cultivars are self-incompatible, tracking the inheritance of this allele in breeding programs is therefore highly desirable. A detailed morphological study was performed on the whole population over three growing seasons, 2001, 2002, and 2003. In 2001 tree characters such as disease prevalence, bare branches, close internodes, level of <b>upright</b> branches, leaf <b>size</b> and colour were measured. For all the seasons a number of other traits were also measured including: yield, bloom time, self-compatibility, percentage of double kernels, shell hardness, kernel weight, shape, taste, pubescence, and colour. The heritability, genetic variance, segregation and raw correlations between traits were calculated and used to establish a mode of inheritance for these traits. Rainfall and temperature maximum, minimum and monthly averages were collected and used to compare trends in the collected morphological data with these climatic data. A preliminary investigation was undertaken to determine if the cellular structure of the kernel testa epidermis was responsible for the pubescent versus smooth mouth feel of the F₁ hybrids. Light and scanning electron microscopy identified the presence of cellular protuberances arising from the epidermis as a potential cause of the pubescent mouthfeel in almonds. Bulked segregant analysis using inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) primers identified a potential marker linked to the pubescent trait which was converted to a sequence characterised amplified region (SCAR), which was also used to screen twelve almond cultivars for this trait. In addition to the use of BSA for the development of markers linked to traits of interest, the development of genetic linkage maps has the potential to greatly enhance current and future breeding programs by MAS. This study produced a genetic linkage map for this population, constructed using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), ISSR, and simple sequence repeats (SSR), with the mapping program Joinmap 3. 0. Two parental maps were constructed, which coalesced into seven linkage groups for the female parent and eight linkage groups for the male parent, corresponding to the chromosome number of eight for almond. The marker density was 9. 4 cM/marker for NP and 9. 6 cM/marker for LA, covering 65 % for the female and male parental maps in compalison to the highly saturated peach x almond map produced by the European Prunus Mapping Program (EPMP). Fourteen markers segregating in both parents were used to produce an integrated parental map for this cross, which coalesced into six linkage groups with a marker density of 11. 6 cM/marker. The presence of anchor loci common to the EPMP map allowed homologolls linkage groups to be established between the two populations. This study has contributed to the understanding of key morphological traits important in almond breeding programs. The expression and influence of biotic factors on the expression of these traits was also investigated. Understanding factors responsible for kernel taste is also an important objective and this study has contributed to this knowledge. The development of a genetic linkage map will serve as a permanent and practical resource for almond breeders in Australia, and contribute important data to the EPMP. This has significant benefit for Prunus breeders worldwide, and further enhances knowledge on an economically important nut cropThesis (Ph. D.)
