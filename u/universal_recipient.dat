Kutner considers a tainted blood transfusion. Foreman says that the low immunoglobulin levels and the other symptoms indicate amyloidosis. Flynn has had a grand mal seizure, then kidney failure. House believes that this proves the diagnosis of amyloidosis, and not a bad blood transfusion as Kutner suggested, and that the patient needs a bone marrow transplant. Since the procedure requires irradiation, House orders a subcutaneous fat biopsy to confirm his diagnosis. House says that while they are waiting for the results of the biopsy, the fellows can check their blood theory. The biopsy ends up being inconclusive, and by the time it is done, the fellows still have not confirmed their blood theory. They ask for more time, but House says the patient cannot wait for their tests to finish. So instead House suggests that they test the blood by giving it to him, and seeing if he gets sick, since he has the <b>universal</b> <b>recipient</b> blood type.|$|E

Here, we have created homozygous rag 2 E 450 fs mutant zebrafish that have reduced numbers of functional T and B cells but are viable and fecund. Mutant fish engraft zebrafish muscle, blood stem cells, and cancers. rag 2 E 450 fs mutant zebrafish are the first immune compromised zebrafish model that permits robust, long-term engraftment of multiple tissues and cancer. Cell transplantation of human and mouse cells into immune compromised mice has greatly enhanced our understanding of stem cell function, regeneration, and cancer. However, transplantation experiments in mice are expensive, routinely utilize small cohorts of animals, and engraftment is often difficult to visualize directly. By contrast, large-scale cell transplantation of fluorescent blood and cancer cells into syngeneic and irradiated zebrafish has now become routine 1 – 7. However, these approaches require that donor cells are from the same strain of syngeneic zebrafish or that the recipient immune system is transiently ablated by whole body γ-irradiation two-days prior to transplantation. Irradiated recipients eventually recover their immune system by 20 days post-irradiation and kill engrafted cells 1, 2, 6, making long-term engraftment studies difficult.

In humans, NK cells have been shown to react with cells from different lineages at early stages of differentiation, such as immature thyrnocytes (6, 7), bone marrow cells (6), and myeloid leukemic cells (8).

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{order to}} {{overcome}} ABO blood group incompatibility, paired donor interchange has been practised in living donor liver transplantation. Liver transplantations using grafts donated by Samaritan living donors {{have been performed}} in Europe, North America, South Korea, and Hong Kong. Such practice is clearly on strong biological grounds although social and psychological implications could be far-reaching. Local experience has been satisfactory but is still limited. As few centers have this arrangement, its safety and viability are still being assessed under a clinical trial setting. METHODS: Here we report a donor interchange involving an ABO-compatible pair with a universal donor and an ABO-incompatible pair with a <b>universal</b> <b>recipient.</b> This matching {{was not only a}} variation but also an extension of the donor interchange scheme. RESULTS: The four operations (two donor hepatectomies and two recipient operations) were successful. All the two donors and the two recipients recovered well. Such donor interchange further supports the altruistic principle of organ donation in contrast to exchange for a gain. CONCLUSIONS: Samaritan donor interchange certainly taxes further the ethical challenge of donor interchange. Although this practice has obvious biological advantages, such advantages have to be weighed against the potential increase in potential psychological risks to the subjects in the interchange. Further ethical and clinical evaluations of local and overseas experiences of donor interchange should guide future clinical practice in utilizing this potential organ source for transplantation. © 2014, Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int.

40|$|International audienceContext The lower spinal {{vertebrae}} {{are often}} repaired through an incision {{directly over the}} spine, called the posterior lumbar approach. In spinal fusion, surgeon stabilizes the back by fusing certain vertebrae together with bone grafts or metal rods. For doing the surgery in minimally invasive approaches, different tools and system are designed to allow cannulated pedicle screws to be placed appropriately in a true percutaneous fashion. However, the rod insertion still has problems and difficulties that prevent the procedure to be in minimally invasive. Purpose The {{purpose of this paper}} is to address the difficulties of the surgical tasks for rod insertion, to review the existing system and procedures for rod insertion, and to propose a new designed system that enables surgeon to insert the rod and guide it through the pedicle screws in MIS conditions. Materials and methods With the collaboration of the Hospital of Grenoble, France, the study started and some spinal fusion operation in open and minimally invasive procedure have been observed and analysed. Based on the extracted task list, a scenario for orthopaedic traumatology was prepared. The main objective for the design was to have a <b>universal</b> <b>recipient</b> rod holder (independent to the rod type), an easy load and unload system, and simple assembly after which fit with the sterilisation procedure. A first prototype have been fabricated and tested on a phantom. With some modification the second prototype have been designed and tested by surgeons on cadaver. Results The result of both ex-vivo and cadaver tests seems promising.

40|$|Bioethics {{has been}} central to living donor liver {{transplantation}} (LDLT), which mandates a high recipient benefit and an acceptably low donor risk. The double equipoise imposes the contextual features of this already technically complex treatment. This research aimed at looking into key bioethical issues of LDLT {{in the light of}} the contemporary practice standards. In adult LDLT, in order to provide a partial graft of adequate size, donor right hepatectomy is often required. This procedure pioneered by The University of Hong Kong is now being performed at many centers and by many surgeons. Through close guidance and gradual granting of surgical privilege, newer surgeons can now perform this operation safely with low blood loss (400 mL) and low complication rates ( 30 %). Analysis of our series also showed that right liver donors with a smaller remnant left liver had higher peak bilirubin level and longer peak prothrombin time after the operation. Severe complications were associated with hyperbilirubinemia (p= 0. 031) while prolonged hospital stay was associated with prolonged prothrombin time (p= 0. 011) and smaller remnant left liver (p= 0. 036). Facts need to be known to potential right liver donors before operation. Donor left hepatectomy, which carries a lower donor risk, is more feasible for donors with a larger left liver and recipients with a smaller body size. Lowering the graft size requirement also allows more LDLTs being done using left livers. The percentages of left liver LDLTs feasible with a graft to standard liver volume (G/SLV) ≥ 40 %, ≥ 35 %, ≥ 30 %, and ≥ 25 % were 5. 8 %, 12. 5 %, 29. 1 %, and 62. 3 % respectively. For every 5 % decrease in G/SLV ratio, twice as many left liver LDLTs could be performed. The 5 -year survival rate was 85. 7 % for liver transplantation recipients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) within the Up-to- 7 criteria, unaffected by the presence of microvascular invasion (88. 2 % vs. 85. 1 %, p= 0. 652). This is comparable with that of liver resection patients with HCC without microvascular invasion (81. 2 %, p= 0. 227) but far superior to that of liver resection patients with lesions with microvascular invasion (50. 0 %, p< 0. 0001). Primary liver transplantation for HCC with microvascular invasion and within the Up-to- 7 criteria in fact doubled the chance of cure as compared with liver resection. LDLT has been criticized of fast-tracking patients with more aggressive HCC for transplant. Waiting does select out patients with better survival to undergo transplantation. With careful selection though without waiting, LDLT nevertheless does not confer poorer survival. Progressive liver failure following a major hepatectomy for HCC is a known and uncommon cause of mortality. Proceeding to LDLT is an ethical challenge because of the possibility of coercion. Tumor status as confirmed by histopathological examination of resected specimens can demonstrate features of more aggressive cancer, which warns against a rescue transplantation for the increase in chance of tumor recurrence. In order to overcome ABO blood group incompatibility, paired donor interchange (between two pairs: A to B and B to A) has been practiced for the liver. The extension to matching with one pair of universal donor (O) and <b>universal</b> <b>recipient</b> (AB) was also performed at our center. The obvious biological advantage of this treatment modality has to be weighed against the potential increase in risks to patients involved. Media coverage of advances and successes in liver transplantation stimulates deceased donor organ donation (DDOD). The relation between widely reported key events and DDOD can be recognized as celebrity hero influence, medical success, or emotional response. An accountable liver transplant service answerable to the public is vital to a region where the DDOD rate is low. Selective disclosure of patient information to the media for public interest in promoting organ donation can be justified. LDLT now has a two-decade history of clinical practice. Basic and clinical research has provided a clearer picture of the efficacy and fallibility of LDLT. We can now be more accurate in defining and interpreting the applicability of LDLT for a wider spectrum of disease indications. published_or_final_versionMedicineMasterDoctor of Medicin...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{voluntary}} provision of public goods in three distinct contexts. Specifically, it studies gifts of blood, money and time. While the first essay undertakes {{to investigate the}} behaviour of blood donors from a theoretical perspective, {{the second and third}} chapter use the tools of empirical applied microeconomics to investigate strategic philanthropy (Chapter 2) and the impact of mandatory volunteering on income (Chapter 3). In Chapter One I use the tools of non-cooperative game theory to study blood donor behaviour. I construct a model in which the decision to donate blood is driven by the need for consumers to obtain insurance against needing a blood transfusion, and in which access to the resources of the blood bank are allocated as under a first-come, first-served policy. I also study the effect of screening policies on the available blood supply, and identify policy instruments which may be effective in increasing the supply of blood. Strikingly, although blood banks typically direct greater effort to persuading universal donors (type O negative) to donate blood, I show that the efficient allocation is for individuals of each blood type to donate the same amount of blood. However, at the Nash equilibrium, the individuals who are the most likely to donate blood are <b>universal</b> <b>recipients,</b> and those who are the least likely are universal donors [...] a prediction that is consistent with observed donation frequency by blood type. The model also predicts that if there is an increase in the probability of needing blood, this will have no impact on donations of those individuals who are faced with a positive probability of not getting blood. I also show that in an economy with "good" blood and "bad" blood donors, if the total amount of bad blood is more than the total amount of good blood, bad blood crowds out good blood. The second chapter is concerned with giving practices that practitioners refer to as strategic philanthropy. Anecdotal evidence that suggests that charitable givers [...] particularly those with the financial means and inclination to make substantial donations - are increasingly strategic in their philanthropic behaviour. However, there is no existing literature which has investigated whether or not so-called strategic givers are in fact determining donations differently from other donors, or whether in fact it is true that strategic behaviour is increasingly prevalent. A first challenge is to discern what specifically might constitute strategic giving, and I propose that strategic philanthropists are individuals who (i) plan their giving; (ii) give most of their philanthropic gifts to a small number of charities, and (iii) get involved in the organisations to which they make gifts. Different estimation methods are applied, and the results show that some charitable givers are strategic in their philanthropic giving, and that the propensity to be strategic is highly and positively correlated with the level of education. My results also show that giving is strategic only when donations are made to secular organisations but not to religious organisations. My results also indicate that strategic behaviour has a substantial positive impact on donations to secular organisations. The last chapter examines the link between volunteering and income, focussing particularly on the impact of mandatory volunteering in high school. I use data from the 2013 Giving, Volunteering and Participation component of the General Social Survy (GSS GVP) to update previous research on the labour market returns to volunteering and find evidence, consistent with previous findings that indivuals who choose to volunteer earn higher incomes. In contrast, when volunteering is mandated for high school students, the impact on income depends on the type of policy and on the time horizon. When the policy requires students to perform free community service, it has no impact on income in the short run but generates a positive return in the long run. In contrast, when the policy requires students to acquire either paid or unpaid work experience, it leads to lower incomes in the short run but has a positive impact in the long run. There are three channels by which {{it has been suggested that}} volunteering leads to high labor market returns: human capital accumulation, strengthening of social networks, and signalling high productivity. The results suggest that when volunteering activities are mandated, this breaks the signal to potential employers. However, mandatory volunteering still leads to human capital accumulation and strengthens social networks, and consequently ultimately generates a positive return. Overall, requiring high school students to undertake free community service yields a better labour market outcome in the short run than the mandated work experience policy...|$|R
