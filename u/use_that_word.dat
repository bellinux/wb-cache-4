25|$|Wittgenstein also ponders the {{possibility}} of a language that talks about those things that are known only to the user, whose content is inherently private. The usual example is that of a language in which one names one's sensations and other subjective experiences, such that the meaning of the term is decided by the individual alone. For example, the individual names a particular sensation, on some occasion, 'S', and intends to <b>use</b> <b>that</b> <b>word</b> to refer to that sensation. Such a language Wittgenstein calls a private language.|$|E
500|$|Barton {{does not}} believe Hollywood offers the same opportunity. In the film, Los Angeles {{is a world of}} false fronts and phony people. This is evident in an early line of the {{screenplay}} (filmed, but not included in the theatrical release); while informing Barton of Capitol Pictures' offer, his agent tells him: [...] "I'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism– [...] if I can <b>use</b> <b>that</b> <b>word</b> and Hollywood in the same breath". Later, as Barton tries to explain why he's staying at the Earle, studio head Jack Lipnick finishes his sentence, recognizing that Barton wants a place that is [...] "less Hollywood". The assumption is that Hollywood is fake and the Earle is genuine. Producer Ben Geisler takes Barton to lunch at a restaurant featuring a mural of the [...] "New York Cafe", a sign of Hollywood's effort to replicate the authenticity of the East Coast. Lipnick's initial overwhelming exuberance is also a façade. Although he begins by telling Barton: [...] "The writer is king here at Capitol Pictures", in the penultimate scene he insists: [...] "If your opinion mattered, then I guess I'd resign and let you run the studio. It doesn't, and you won't, and the lunatics are not going to run this particular asylum".|$|E

Rundgren's production of Meat Loaf's Bat Out of Hell (1977) (on which he also played lead guitar) helped that album {{become one of the}} top selling LPs released in the 1970s. The industry regard for Rundgren's production work has been a lofty one: Jim Steinman, with whom Rundgren worked on Bat Out of Hell, has said in interviews, that [...] "Todd Rundgren is a genius and I don't <b>use</b> <b>that</b> <b>word</b> a lot." ...|$|E
2500|$|Production of {{the film}} Steel started with music {{producer}} Quincy Jones and his partner David Salzman. Both Jones and Salzman were fans of the Steel character, especially Jones, who found personal reasons to support the project.

[...] "The last page {{came out of the}} typewriter and was approved by Admiral Denfeld at three o'clock the following morning.

As follows: [...] "The cover design {{on this issue}} of Foreign Service is a two-color reproduction of the official 1932 Buddy Poppy poster. (It was so named because former soldiers would <b>use</b> <b>that</b> <b>word,</b> in describing their comrades who perished in WWI.) The original was painted in oil by the late Paul Martin, noted New York poster artist, who died suddenly on March 19th following a serious operation. The poster has been pronounced {{as one of the}} most striking and appropriate designs ever used, to depict the symbolism of the Buddy Poppy. (A bright red artificial flower, that was worn in honor of the fallen Allied soldiers.) It was completed shortly before the artist's death and is believed to have been his last important assignment [...] Those familiar with Paul Martin's career as an artist, declare the 1932 Buddy Poppy poster to be one of his best creations." ...|$|E

2500|$|Goodman {{was also}} {{responsible}} for a significant step in racial integration in America. In the early 1930s, black and white musicians could not play together in most clubs and concerts. In the Southern states, racial segregation was enforced by the Jim Crow laws. Goodman broke with tradition by hiring Teddy Wilson to play with him and the drummer Gene Krupa in the Benny Goodman Trio. In 1936, he added the vibraphonist Lionel Hampton to form the Benny Goodman Quartet. In 1939 Goodman added the pioneering jazz guitarist Charlie Christian to his band and small ensembles; Christian played with him until his death from tuberculosis {{less than three years}} later. This integration in music happened ten years before Jackie Robinson became the first black American to enter Major League Baseball. [...] " [...] popularity was such that he could remain financially viable without touring the South, where he would have been subject to arrest for violating Jim Crow laws." [...] According to Jazz by Ken Burns, when someone asked him why he [...] "played with that nigger" [...] (referring to Teddy Wilson), Goodman replied, [...] "I'll knock you out if you <b>use</b> <b>that</b> <b>word</b> around me again".|$|E
2500|$|Although he {{initially}} enjoyed {{good relations with}} [...] US President John F. Kennedy, who admired his stance against the Soviet Union—particularly when the Berlin Wall was being built—and who called him [...] "a great captain of the Western world", their relationship later cooled. De Gaulle was Kennedy's most loyal ally during the Cuban Missile Crisis and supported the right that the [...] US claimed to defend its interests in the western hemisphere, in contrast to then German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer who doubted Kennedy's commitment to Europe and thought the crisis could have been avoided. De Gaulle accepted {{that it might be}} necessary for the United States to take preemptive military action against Cuba, unlike many other European leaders of his time. De Gaulle was a prominent figure at Kennedy's funeral. De Gaulle was very much admired by the later President Nixon. After a meeting at the Palace of Versailles just before the general left office, Nixon declared that [...] "He did not try to put on airs but an aura of majesty seemed to envelop him ... his performance—and I do not <b>use</b> <b>that</b> <b>word</b> disparagingly—was breathtaking."
