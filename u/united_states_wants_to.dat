2500|$|It's {{pretty hard}} {{to say on the}} one hand that we feel very {{strongly}} about Pakistani and Indian nuclear testing {{and on the other hand}} the U.S. Senate won't ratify the ...treaty... The last thing the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> see is a resumption of nuclear testing or the proliferation of nuclear weapons – and it is the last thing Australia wants to see. By refusing to ratify this treaty, the United States Senate has done a lot to undermine the arms control agenda that the international community, including Australia, has been working on.|$|E
2500|$|U.S. State Department {{spokesman}} Charles E. Redman {{told reporters}} [...] "What is important {{now is to}} put it behind us and concentrate on the larger issues, especially our shared commitment to peace in the Middle East." [...] When asked by a reporter if the U.S. had any reason to apologize for the diversion of the airliner, he replied [...] "Never." [...] White House spokesman Larry Speakes stated that the U.S. would work to restore good relations with Egypt {{there was to be}} no apology, [...] "We've said everything we need to say." [...] During the incident the U.S. praised Egypt's efforts to save the lives of the hostages, never criticized Mubarak personally, but did make it clear that they were displeased by Egypt's [...] "independent" [...] decision to give the hijackers safe passage. White House spokesman Larry Speakes told reporters at the time [...] "The <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> emphasize the fundamental and durable interest that the United States and Egypt share, interests which transcends this difficult incident." [...] Mubarak described what the U.S. had done as a [...] "stab in the back". The Reagan administration sent a diplomatic envoy led by Deputy Secretary of State John C. Whitehead to Egypt for a [...] "thorough and friendly discussion" [...] telling Mubarak that they hoped to [...] "put our recent differences behind us." ...|$|E
50|$|The Mexican {{government}} stated {{they will}} not under any circumstances accept foreign nationals from third countries that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> deport. In recent years the majority crossing from Mexico into the United States have been from Central America.|$|E
50|$|During the Cold War, the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{learn more}} about Soviet {{submarine}} and missile technology, specifically ICBM test and nuclear first strike capability.|$|R
50|$|In 1795, Muñoz rose to Colonel in the Army. The Crown {{ordered him}} to avoid the {{entrance}} {{of people from the}} then <b>United</b> <b>States</b> (East of the modern <b>United</b> <b>States)</b> to Texas. They believed the government of <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> send people to Texas to promote a rebellion against the government.|$|R
25|$|Before the Doha ministerial, {{negotiations}} {{had already}} been under way on trade in agriculture and trade in services. These ongoing negotiations had been required under the last round of multilateral trade negotiations (the Uruguay Round, 1986–1994). However, some countries, including the <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> expand the agriculture and services talks to allow trade-offs and thus achieve greater trade liberalization.|$|R

5000|$|Jacobson {{states that}} if the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> reduce global warming, air {{pollution}} and energy instability, it should invest only in the best energy options, and that nuclear power {{is not one of}} them. Jacobson's analyses state that [...] "nuclear power results in up to 25 times more carbon emissions than wind energy, when reactor construction, uranium refining and transport are considered". These calculations are based on a 2009 paper of Jacobson's that was published in Energy and Environmental Science, which report nuclear emissions to be in the range of 68-180.1 g/kWh.|$|E
5000|$|The {{island has}} no {{permanent}} population, and conditions {{are said to}} be harsh and unpleasant. The island {{is in a state of}} terra nullius, since neither Canada nor the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> claim the land and each country says it belongs to the other. (See Bir Tawil for a similar real-life example of this.) Bullwinkle J. Moose serves as Moosylvania's presumed namesake and its governor but only stays two weeks at a time, since (according to Bullwinkle) [...] "after two weeks here, anyplace else feels like Heaven." ...|$|E
50|$|The New York City parade is {{held every}} third Saturday in September (on the 17th in 2016, on the 16th in 2017, {{and on the}} 15th in 2018). It was founded in 1957 by {{immigrants}} from Germany who, {{being part of the}} largest self-reported immigrant ancestral group in the <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> keep the traditions of their German homeland alive.|$|R
50|$|The ongoing Chinese Civil War {{and thus}} the {{question}} of which Chinese government was legitimate presented a dilemma to conference organizers. The <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> invite the Republic of China (ROC) on Taiwan to represent China, while the United Kingdom wished to invite the People's Republic of China (PRC) on mainland China as China's representative. As a compromise, neither government was invited.|$|R
5000|$|Fisher {{was known}} for a unique idea towards nuclear deterrence. In a March 1981 paper, while {{discussing}} the importance on reaching a [...] "wise decision", {{especially in terms of}} nuclear arms, he suggested implanting the nuclear launch codes in a volunteer. If the President of the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> activate nuclear weapons, he would be required to kill the volunteer to retrieve the codes.|$|R
5000|$|John Dickerson and Dahlia Lithwick of Slate {{suggested}} that the Iraqis {{should be able to}} put the Marines on trial:"Let's let the Iraqis put the Americans alleged to have committed these crimes on trial. The <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> encourage the fledgling Iraqi institution of democracy, right? That's why we wanted Saddam tried in Iraq, and through the Iraqi judicial system--both to build up its legitimacy and to give Iraqis the sense of ownership that comes with having control over the legal process. Why, then, shouldn't we also turn over our own soldiers who were involved in either the Haditha massacre {{or any of the other}} possible massacres for trial under the Iraqi justice system?" ...|$|E
5000|$|US {{officials}} have denied the general perception in Pakistan that the US {{government wants to}} influence the electoral process in Pakistan {{to bring in a}} friendly government. US Secretary of State John Kerry skipped a planned visit to Pakistan to avoid accusations of meddling in the 11 May elections. Spokesperson Victoria Nuland stated that the message the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> send out during the election season is [...] "we have no favourites among Pakistani politicians and we are looking forward to work with whoever is elected on May 11." [...] Secretary Kerry's decision to skip Pakistan during his South Asia visit is an indication of Washington's eagerness to maintain neutrality during the elections.|$|E
5000|$|Prime Minister of Italy Silvio Berlusconi refused {{foreign aid}} for the emergency, saying that Italians were [...] "proud people" [...] and had {{sufficient}} resources {{to deal with the}} crisis. However he singled out the United States, announcing that he would accept aid for reconstruction: [...] "If the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> give a tangible sign of its solidarity with Italy, it could take on the responsibility of rebuilding heritage sites and churches. We would be very happy to have this support." [...] and suggested the USA help rebuild [...] "a small district of a town or a suburb". Aid was offered by Austria, Brazil, Croatia, the European Union, France, Germany, Spain, Greece, Slovakia, Israel, Portugal, Iran, Macedonia, Mexico,Russia, Serbia, Slovenia, Switzerland, Tunisia, the Turkish Red Crescent, Ukraine, and the United States.Aid was also offered by various organisations, companies, sport clubs and celebrities including ACF Fiorentina, Carla Bruni, Madonna, S.S.C. Napoli, Zastava and Fiat.|$|E
50|$|Franklin Roosevelt {{promptly}} informed Winston Churchill {{that the}} <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> approach directly the Portuguese {{government for the}} purpose of also obtaining aviation facilities in the Azores. The negotiations for the agreement between the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> and Portugal, conducted initially by George Kennan Chargé d’Affairs in Portugal, were long and complex. The final agreement was signed in November 28, 1944 between US ambassador Raymond Henry Norweb and Salazar.|$|R
2500|$|On 11 April 2014 the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) {{announced}} that it had added Chornomornaftagaz to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List {{as part of the}} third round of U.S. sanctions. Reuters quoted an anonymous U.S. official who explained that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make it impossible for Gazprom to [...] "have dealings with Chornomorneftegaz", and if that were to happen, Gazprom itself could face sanctions.|$|R
25|$|Later on, Novo Ecijanos would {{continue}} {{to participate in the}} drama of war, revolution and the fight for freedom. They would fight when the revolt against Spain continued after the peace treaty broke down and the <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> after declaring war on Spain, promised to help Filipinos fight for freedom. Then, Novo Ecijanos again joined General Emilio Aguinaldo in the Philippine–American War (after it became evident the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make the Philippines their own colony).|$|R
40|$|This Note {{addresses}} {{the problems in}} copyright law created by orphan works. The Author identifies three issues. First, it stifles creativity by limiting the public’s access to the piece. Second, it defeats the economic incentive to create copyrightable works because no one can receive the potential royalty if the copyright owner cannot be found. Third, it undermines copyright law by forcing some orphan works users to violate infringement laws, despite efforts to comply. Recent attempts at legislation have been unsuccessful. According to the Author, the sole remedy is to create uniformly-applied legislation that fairly balances the interests of copyright holders, {{those who want to}} use copyrighted materials, and the public’s access to and the availability of as many creative works as possible. Part I of this Note is an overview of the copyright system. Part II illustrates factors that contribute to a copyrighted work becoming orphaned. Part III discusses the Copyright Office’s Report on Orphan Works from 2006 and Congress’s proposed acts in 2008. Part IV examines why the proposed acts in 2008 ultimately did not pass in Congress. Part V discusses alternatives to legislative action. Part VI details what it means to conduct a reasonably diligent search. Part VII is an application of the proposed definition of the term, “reasonably diligent search. ” The Author notes that if the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> become a world leader in copyright law, Congress should enact legislation regarding the orphan works problem—a global, not just domestic, problem. The benefits of a legislative solution are better than the benefits of other potential solutions and, more importantly, are not unrealistic, but are completely plausible...|$|E

In their view, the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> break up Russia and turn it into a source of raw materials. The West being accused of Russophobia is a major part of their belief.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, with {{increased}} European-American settlement, the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> relocate all Native Americans from Michigan and Wisconsin to {{west of the}} Mississippi River, proposing to consolidate them on the White Earth Reservation in Minnesota. The proposed relocation plan proved futile. The tribes resisted and a minor rebellion broke out in 1898 on the Leech Lake Reservation of northern Minnesota. The US finally left the tribes in small rural reservations in these areas.|$|R

500|$|It {{was decided}} to issue a statement, the Potsdam Declaration, {{defining}} [...] "Unconditional Surrender" [...] and clarifying what it meant for {{the position of the}} emperor and for Hirohito personally. The American and British governments strongly disagreed on this point—the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> abolish the position and possibly try him as a war criminal, while the British <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> retain the position, perhaps with Hirohito still reigning. The Potsdam Declaration went through many drafts until a version acceptable to all was found.|$|R
50|$|As {{historian}} Bruce Cumings noted, the Korean War {{heightened the}} Cold War, bringing both nations {{closer to a}} nuclear war. The <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> ensure that the United Nations wouldn't fail, as it had done with the League of Nations, and hence <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> show off its power to the world. Additionally, it <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> exhibit that it could still tame the communist threat, now also present in Asia. Similarly, the Soviet Union <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> demonstrate its newly built military strength to the <b>United</b> <b>States.</b>|$|R
25|$|Several notable events {{occurred}} during {{the operation of the}} Allied Translator and Interpreter Section, including the translation and analysis of the captured Z-Plan in 1944, which outlined Japan's defensive plans against Allied attacks on its Pacific territory, such as the Mariana Islands in the north west Pacific. The <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> capture these islands for use as a bombing base to raid the Japanese mainland. The Z-Plan also contained a strategy for engaging the Allied forces in a decisive battle.|$|R
50|$|Originally, the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{relocate}} all Anishinaabe {{people from}} Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota to the White Earth Reservation {{in the western}} part of Minnesota. It planned to open the land of the vacated reservations to sale and settlement by European Americans. The US government even proposed relocating the Dakota people to the White Earth Reservation, although the two peoples had been traditional enemies since the Anishinaabe had invaded their land in the late 18th century. The US continued to promote this policy until 1898.|$|R
2500|$|Although he {{acknowledges}} that free trade has been detrimental to the American middle class, he advises the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> not to protect its economy with protectionist measures and to pursue this policy {{for the benefit of}} other countries: [...] "The real strategic choice Americans face is whether the objective of their policies is to see the economies {{of the rest of the}} world grow and prosper. Or, does the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> keep the rest of the world from threatening it by slowing global growth and walling off products and people?" ...|$|R
50|$|Once the {{commander}} of Fort Snelling received the message from Onigum, he sent a force of 20 soldiers to the Leech Lake Reservation. They arrived at Walker which was very near the Reservation, on September 30. As was custom, the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> first attempted to negotiate but met with a negative response. With the Chippewas not willing to negotiate, another telegram was sent to Fort Snelling requesting for more soldiers. An indication that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> show a stronger military presence or the Chippewa's soldiers were increasing in numbers for a war.|$|R
50|$|Hamilton, Ohio, {{was founded}} in 1791 as Fort Hamilton (named to honor Alexander Hamilton). The {{northwest}} frontier military fort was built {{to serve as a}} supply station for the troops of generals Arthur St. Clair and later Anthony Wayne. Their armies entered the Miami Valley to drive out the Shawnee and Miami during the Northwest Indian War of the 1790s. The Indians hoped to maintain their territory here, but, following the American Revolutionary War, the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> open it for European-American settlement and succeeded in pushing out the indigenous peoples.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, {{after the end}} of the Indian Wars, the federal {{government}} worked to move Native American tribes on to Indian reservations, requiring them to cede land and extinguish their land claims to large areas of territory. The <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> open the West to settlement and development by European Americans. The Blackfeet Indian Reservation, with members mostly of the Piegan Blackfeet branch, was established by Treaty of 1896 to the east of this forest area and Glacier National Park, bordering the province of Alberta, Canada to the north.|$|R

50|$|The bulk of Missouri lies {{north of}} the 36°30′ line, but Southern {{planters}} who lived in southeastern Missouri supported slavery, especially for farming on their cotton plantations. Hence, part of the Missouri Compromise arose from this. Also, the slave states of the Southern <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{have the support of}} another slave state so the Senate could not abolish slavery in the <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> This situation remained in effect for decades because as the free states of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Iowa were admitted to the Union, the new slave states of Arkansas, Florida, and Texas were also admitted.|$|R
50|$|Once {{the first}} Chippewa {{settlers}} reached the Great Falls region, {{they could not}} ignore the five waterfalls which make up the Great Falls of the Missouri River, and also Giant Springs {{which is the largest}} freshwater spring in the <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> At one time a lake was located a few miles north of Great Falls which is known as Black Horse Lake. To the northwest of Black Horse Lake is Benton Lake. Historians claim the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> use Benton Lake for irrigation for nearby farms and in the late 19th century commenced to dig canals for that purpose.|$|R
5000|$|The British {{relationship}} with the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> did not suffer lasting consequences from the crisis. [...] "The Anglo-American 'special relationship' was revitalised immediately after the Suez Crisis." [...] The <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> restore the prestige of its closest ally. The two governments ... engaged in almost ritualistic reassurances that their 'special relationship' would be restored quickly", in particular Britain's first Hydrogen bomb test Operation Grapple {{which led to the}} 1958 US-UK Mutual Defence Agreement. Six years after the crisis, the Americans amazed the British by selling them state-of-the-art missile technology at a moderate cost, which became the UK Polaris programme.|$|R

50|$|The <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> settle The People on {{reservations}} {{to extinguish}} their title to other lands {{and encourage them}} to adopt the western model of subsistence farming to assimilate to majority culture. The federal government believed that separating The People from the rest of its citizens would solve land disputes and reduce tensions between cultures. The development of reservations was a campaign promise of U.S. President Andrew Jackson. His administration set aside Indian Territory in lands west of the Mississippi River, far from the traditional homelands of the American Southeast and other areas from which they forced tribes.|$|R
