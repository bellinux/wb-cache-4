5000|$|Cordova High School {{opened in}} 1887. The {{origin of the}} high school traces its roots back to 1887 when the high school {{curriculum}} was established. A booklet titled [...] "Cordova High School: The Spirit Survives!" [...] written in 2000 showed the spirit of the Cordova [...] "kids" [...] lives on to this day. The school began in 1887 and the last class graduated in 1955 after which there was a consolidation of several area schools that became Riverdale Unit #100 based in Port Byron, Illinois. The original Cordova High School was held in a two-story stone building that was used as both a grade school and high school. This building contained four rooms. The site of the demolished building in 2006 was this same site of the original school, however the building that existed there in 2006 was not the original. In 1920 the building's upper floors were declared unsafe and classes were moved to the Methodist Church in Cordova. That same year, financing for a new high school building was approved. Construction began on a new building in October 1921 and was completed in August 1922. The building remained as the Cordova High School building until the school's closing in 1955. At some point, {{at the site of the}} original building, a new school was erected and used as a grade school. Records are <b>usure</b> of the actual date of this construction but this building continued to be used through the consolidation of 1955. Its usefulness lasted through the 1970s when it was closed due to new construction at what is now known as the Riverdale Elementary Building. This grade school building was purchased and used as a restaurant known as the [...] "Cordova Landing" [...] for many years. The building was eventual sold and sat empty for several years. The Village of Cordova eventually took possession of the building and had it torn down early spring 2006. When the Cordova High School building used from 1922 through 1955 was closed, it never again was used in any capacity. This once grand building, full of life, was eventually torn down in the late 1960s. The property on which this building sat was turned into a housing addition.|$|E

We first traces Bazard’s exposure to Bentham through his unknown friendship with Bentham’s publisher Etienne Dumont. After introducing in details the Saint-Simonian views on interest and money, we examines the significance of Bazard’s translation of Defence of Usury and his shared opposition against <b>usure</b> laws. We explain why the puzzling reference to Benthamite utilitarianism is not fortuitous but appears to justify a common ground between Bentham’s utilitarism and Saint-Simonianism. This connection did not survive the July Revolution. utilitarianism, saint-simonism, interest rate, usury...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, the TiC-based cermets with {{addition}} of TiN were fabricated by a conventional powder metallurgy process. The titanium nitride (TiN) and titanium carbide (TiC) used as starting powders have been synthesized by the self-propagating high temperature synthesis (SHS) method. This exothermic reaction, easy to process, allows to obtain fine and original powders from low-cost raw materials. Cermets obtained by sintering powders of TiC and Mo 2 C with nickel binder phase are investigated. The effect of TiN adding on the microstructure and the mechanical properties of these composites are studied. Microstructures {{have been observed}} by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Room temperature mechanical properties such as Youngs modulus, fracture toughness and microhardness have been measured and related to morphology and chemical composition of the samples. Tribological experiments were also performed and the friction coefficient of a cermet containing titanium nitride was {{compared with that of}} other hard materials. The SHS starting powders used present some particularities, as it was shown in a previous study [Matériaux à base de carbures et nitrures, pour coupe et <b>usure,</b> obtenus à partir de poudre SHS, PhD Thesis, INSA Lyon, 2004]. The purpose of this work is to show that results concerning the impact of TiN addition on microstructure and mechanical properties obtained on bulk specimens, from these original starting powders, are similar to the ones obtained on alloys from commercial starting powder...|$|E
40|$|In thermal {{transformation}} {{processes for}} the production of metal parts of complex shape, shaping tools are frequently used. In die forging as an example, the tools are exposed to high mechanical and thermal loads and therefore subject to heavy wear. For fast feedback directly in the production process the accuracy to size of metal parts produced in such a way is at present frequently checked with groping measuring tools. This is unsatisfactory because of the complex forms, the broad product range and the thermal conditions. A 3 D – measurement system for highest possible flexibility and industrial environment, conceived for this application and based on a 3 D- sensor attached to an industrial robot for positioning is described here. The Structured – Light approach is used, i. e. the sensor consists of one or several CCD- cameras, combined with a programmable line projector. Two different calibration procedures of the line projector system are compared, on the one hand based on a polynomial model with a large number of coefficients, on the other hand based on a model targeted towards the actual optical / physical conditions with a significantly smaller number of coefficients. Finally a procedure for the solution of the Sensor to Hand calibration of the measuring robot is shown.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to study the machinability of CMMP as a structural material in substitution for refractory alloys and to understand the mechanisms generating dust related to their dry machining. The different levels of reinforcement of CMM (5, 15, 25, 35 % of SiCp) and the variety of PCD tools and nanostructured diamond coatings studied, assessed in a first step the structural choice of tools in relationship with the industrial feasibility of their use in high speed dry machining of CMM Al / SiC. The feasibility study and recommendation tool were made taking into account different criteria: the energy, the structural and environmental quality. Damage modes {{and the performance of}} cutting tools have been observed and analyzed in tests of wear and durability. The presence of adhesive wear mode followed by an abrasive consumption interface increases the importance {{of the structure of the}} tool (homogeneity, multiple interfaces [...] .) The dust emission is finally analyzed in terms of structural modification of the composite material (heat treatment) and the reinforcement rate. Environmental sustainability of its machining is also assessed by an analysis of tool life. The process of dust generation is strongly related to tools behaviour, and the predominance of friction phenomena that arise at the tool / chip interface. L'objectif de ce travail est d'étudier l'usinabilité des CMMp comme matériau de structure en substitution aux alliages réfractaires et de comprendre les mécanismes générateurs de poussière inhérents à leur usinage à sec. Les différents niveaux de chargement en céramique du CMM (5, 15, 25, 35 % de SiCp) ainsi que la variété d'outils PCD et des revêtements diamants nanostructurés étudiés, a permis d'évaluer dans un premier temps le choix structurel d'outillages en liaison avec la faisabilité industrielle de leur usage en usinage grande vitesse à sec d'un CMM Al/SiC. L'étude de faisabilité et la préconisation d'outillages ont été effectuées en prenant en compte des critères énergétiques et de qualité structurelle et environnementale. Les modes d'endommagement ainsi que les performances d'outils coupants ont été observés et analysés lors d'essais d'usure accélérée et de durabilité. La présence d'une <b>usure</b> adhésive suivie d'un mode abrasif de consommation d'interface accroit l'importance de la structure de l'outil (homogénéité, multiplicité des interface...|$|E
