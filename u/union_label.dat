Only printer wives were eligible to be elected to the WIA local and international offices.

25|$|Higgins J {{agreed with}} the {{majority}} that sections 5 and 8 of the Act were beyond power, but, having rejected the reserved powers doctrine in his dissent in R v Barger, and the <b>Union</b> <b>Label</b> case, his Honour reasons were significantly different. Higgins J distinguished between the status of corporations and the rights and liabilities attaching to that status, holding that the trade and commerce power and the corporations power were mutually exclusive. In this case the Act was substantially with respect to trade and commerce and thus it could not validly be a law with respect to corporations.|$|E
25|$|The {{album was}} {{predominantly}} written by vocalist and rhythm guitarist Juanita Stein. The {{majority of the}} album's themes revolve around her own relationships and feelings of affection. Most of the songs were demoed in Australia, but all were recorded in England, as the band relocated there to work with Ken Nelson. Five singles were released from the album, four of which appeared on the UK Singles Chart. The album peaked in the Top100 in the UK and just outside the Top50 in Australia. It was, at the time, the fastest selling album on the Bella <b>Union</b> <b>label,</b> and it appeared on {{album of the year}} lists in eight different publications. In 2006, Howling Bells was a finalist for the Australian Music Prize Award and a nominee for the Shortlist Music Prize. The 12-track set features a wide array of music styles, including rock, pop, country, folk and blues.|$|E

[...] The unions undertook a major strike in 1907, {{in an attempt}} to prevent the employment of youths on certain machines.

25|$|In Australian {{constitutional}} law, {{the early}} {{decisions of the}} court were influenced by United States constitutional law. In the case of D'Emden v Pedder (1904), which involved the application of Tasmanian stamp duty to a federal official's salary, the court adopted the doctrine of implied immunity of instrumentalities which had been established in the United States Supreme Court case of McCulloch v. Maryland (1803). That doctrine established that any attempt {{by the federal government}} to interfere with the legislative or executive power of the Australian states was invalid, and vice versa. Accompanying that doctrine was the doctrine of reserved State powers, which was based on the principle that the powers of the Australian parliament should be interpreted narrowly, to avoid intruding on areas of power traditionally exercised by the state parliaments. The concept was developed in such cases as Peterswald v Bartley (1904), R v Barger (1908) and the <b>Union</b> <b>Label</b> case (1908).|$|E
25|$|Howling Bells was {{released}} on 8May 2006 in the United Kingdom through Bella Union and on 1July in Australia through Liberation. It appeared for two weeks on the UK Albums Chart, where it peaked in the Top100. It also appeared for two weeks on the Australian Albums Chart, where it peaked just outside the Top50. The release was, at the time, officially declared the fastest selling album on the Bella <b>Union</b> <b>label.</b> It sold 8,000 copies within the first two weeks, and by October, 25,000 copies had been sold. In a competition that is artist or label self-nominated, Howling Bells was one of nine finalists out nearly 200 nominees for the 2006 Australian Music Prize Award (AMP). The eventual winner was Moo, You Bloody Choir by Augie March. A panel of entertainment industry members and journalists nominated Howling Bells for the 2006 Shortlist Music Prize. The eventual winner of that award was The Greatest by Cat Power. Howling Bells appeared on {{album of the year}} lists in eight different publications.

2500|$|Issacs J {{had also}} {{rejected}} the reserved powers doctrine in R v Barger, and the <b>Union</b> <b>Label</b> case. His Honour, in dissent, gave a broad {{meaning to the}} corporations power but attempted to set limits to the power, in particular holding that the corporations power does not [...] "concern itself with purely internal management, or mere personal preparation to act; it views the beings upon which it is to operate in their relations to outsiders, or, in other words, in the actual exercise of their corporate powers, and entrusts to the Commonwealth Parliament the regulation of {{the conduct of the}} corporations in their transactions with or as affecting the public.” It would appear, for reasons that are not explained in the judgement, that his Honour saw manufacturing and mining corporations as falling outside the class of trading or financial corporations.|$|E

No more were they worried by slack times, strike and lockout, and the <b>union</b> <b>label.</b> They lived in more comfortable homes and in delightful cities of their own--delightful compared with the slums and ghettos in which they had formerly dwelt. They had better food to eat, less hours of labor, more holidays, and a greater amount and variety of interests and pleasures. And for their less fortunate brothers and sisters, the unfavored laborers, the driven people of the abyss, they cared nothing. An age of selfishness was dawning upon mankind. And yet this is not altogether true. The labor castes were honeycombed by our agents--men whose eyes saw, beyond the belly-need, the radiant figure of liberty and brotherhood.|$|E
