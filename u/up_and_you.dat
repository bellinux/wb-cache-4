500|$|At age 25, Vettel {{became the}} {{youngest}} triple world champion of the sport, six years younger than Ayrton Senna had been in 1991. On drawing level with Senna, Vettel commented: [...] "To win that third title here, where one of my greatest idols, Ayrton Senna, was from, {{it is very difficult}} to imagine I join him and other great names by winning three successive titles". Red Bull's team principal Christian Horner praised his driver, saying [...] "Sebastian has driven better than ever this season and has fought his way back into this championship, he's never given <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> saw that in today's race".|$|E
500|$|According to Lo, {{the songs}} on her {{extended}} play Truth Serum are about her [...] "most intense" [...] failed relationship. She stated, [...] "In its entirety, [...] a love story from beginning to end. The song 'Love Ballad' is about the moment you decide to give everything to another person, while 'Habits' shows what happens when everything is screwed <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> just want to freak out. 'Out of Mind' deals with the stage after that, when your broken heart has mended, but the scars are still there". In an interview with Klap Magazine, Lo said, [...] "'Love Ballad' is actually {{supposed to be a}} way of telling the one I love I'd do anything for him. He's worth the pain. A bit exaggerated but that's what it feels like when you're so into someone".|$|E
500|$|Martin Singer, an {{attorney}} representing Cosby, {{made a statement}} in which he asserted Dickinson was not being truthful in her account. After Singer's statement, Dickinson reappeared on a subsequent broadcast of Entertainment Tonight to reassert her account from her prior interview on the program. In addition, she publicized photographs she took with a Polaroid camera of Cosby wearing a checkered bathrobe {{in order to support}} her assertions. In the interview with Kevin Frazier she stated her account was the truth: [...] "It is not a lie. It is my right as a woman. I have to speak <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> {{have to be able to}} go in and just be brave and do it for all the women that can't come forward." [...] She explained her motivation for going public and her desire for her voice to be heard: [...] "The loss of innocence that I suffered and that these women suffered is why I'm sitting here today. And I don't care about what Cosby or networks or anybody says, you will hear me." ...|$|E

500|$|Over {{the winter}} of 1982/83, England's winning Ashes team {{travelled}} to Australia under Willis' captaincy. Willis took two three-wicket hauls in two warm-up first-class matches; however, he was absent from two others and Botham took over the captaincy. By now, continuing injury problems were beginning to plague the ageing bowler's body. He took 3/95 in the first Test as Australia reached 424 in reply to England's first innings 411, of which Willis had made 26. Derek Randall's century in England's second innings took them to 358, and Australia reached 73 {{at the close of}} play on the final day for the loss of two wickets, both of which were taken by Willis, leaving the match drawn. Willis picked up 5/66 in the second Test; however, Australia easily reached a low fourth innings target to go 1–0 up. The third Test followed a similar pattern, with England replying with two low scores in the face of Australia's first innings 438, and Australia taking an eight-wicket win to take a 2–0 lead in the series, despite Willis' three wickets. England achieved what was then the narrowest Ashes victory margin of three runs in the fourth Test at Melbourne, with Willis taking three wickets. Wills commentated on the game that [...] "You never give <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> never think it has gone." [...] The fifth match ended in a draw, so Australia won the series 2–1. Across the entire tour, Willis took 28 first-class wickets. In the following World Series Cup between England, Australia and New Zealand, England were knocked out despite 14 wickets for Willis at 21.14.|$|E
500|$|Another {{challenge}} that the studio {{had to face}} was to deliver shots of heavy and deep snow that both interacted believably with characters and had a realistic sticky quality. According to principal software engineer Andrew Selle, [...] "'s not really a fluid. It’s not really a solid. It breaks apart. It can be compressed into snowballs. All of these different effects {{are very difficult to}} capture simultaneously." [...] In order to achieve this, software engineers used advanced mathematics (the material point method) and physics, with assistance from mathematics researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles to create a snow simulator software application called Matterhorn. The tool was capable of depicting realistic snow in a virtual environment and was used in at least 43 scenes in the film, including several key sequences. Software engineer Alexey Stomakhin referred to snow as [...] "an important character in the film," [...] therefore it attracted special attention from the filmmakers. [...] "When you stretch it, snow will break into chunks. Since snow doesn't have any connections, it doesn't have a mesh, it can break very easily. So that was an important property we took advantage of," [...] explained Selle. [...] "There you see [...] walking through and see his footprints breaking the snow into little pieces and chunk <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> see [...] being pulled out and the snow having packed together and broken into pieces. It's very organic how that happens. You don't see that they're pieces already– you see the snow as one thing and then breaking up." [...] The tool also proved to be particularly useful in scenes involving characters walking through deep snow, as it ensured that the snow reacted naturally to each step.|$|E
500|$|In an interview, Lo {{summarised}} the storyline of the EP; [...] "The song 'Love Ballad' {{is about}} the moment you decide to give everything to another person, while 'Habits' shows what happens when everything is screwed <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> just want to freak out. 'Out of Mind' deals with the stage after that, when your broken heart has mended, but the scars are still there". The EP's main genres are pop, electropop and indie pop. The Swedish edition of Truth Serum opens with [...] "Love Ballad", a pop song with drum instrumentation. It {{was described as a}} [...] "parody of love songs" [...] that talks about the [...] "carefree beginnings of a new romance". Lo also called it a [...] "way of telling the one I love I'd do anything for him". In the standard edition, the EP opens with [...] "Not on Drugs", a pop, dance and electropop song in which the artist compares falling in love to being under the influence of drugs. Following the narrative of Truth Serum, it represents the happy beginning of the relationship, when Lo was [...] "really in love" [...] and [...] " [...] think straight". [...] "Paradise" [...] is a jungle and drum and bass song with electronic elements; it talks about the moment when Lo realizes that she needs and relies on her partner. The electropop song [...] "Over" [...] details the part when Lo and her boyfriend end the relationship. The singer stated that it was about [...] "me making a big mistake and having to confess and come clean". [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] is a pop and electropop track which talks about the artist's hedonistic attempts to forget her former boyfriend. [...] "Out of Mind" [...] is a pop song with minimal instrumentation. According to Lo, it represents the part when [...] "I have the pain and I'm trying to get over this heartbreak. It's when you moved on and you're sort of okay, but you still have that little scar". The EP's last track is the downtempo [...] "Stay High", a remix version of [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] by record production duo Hippie Sabotage.|$|E

2500|$|Saadia Gaon {{read the}} words of [...] "And your silver and your gold is multiplied, and all that you have is multiplied; then your heart be lifted <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> forget the Lord your God," [...] to teach that {{if all goes well}} and runs {{smoothly}} for those engaged in the accumulation of money, then they are apt to put their entire trust in money and forget to make mention of their Master and deny their Provider. Reading [...] Hezekiah ben Manoah (the Hizkuni) lamented that the phenomenon of becoming haughty is tragically all too common. Reading [...] Bahya ben Asher taught that pride is the principal cause of forgetting essentials. Due to the abundance of affluence, peace, and tranquility, a person's heart can become haughty and smug, and the evil urge ( [...] , yetzer hara) can find it easy to provoke a person to follow the heart without restraint. When that happens, Heaven's concerns become marginal. In [...] "and you say in your heart: ‘My strength and the power of my hand has gotten me this wealth,'" [...] Bahya ben Asher read Moses to warn of the possibility that arrogance can lead one to ascribe affluence to one's own lucky stars. And reading [...] "you shall remember the Lord your God," [...] Bahya ben Asher taught that God alone is the Source of good fortune, because God has given people the strength to perform deeds of valor, and has handed people the power to overcome bad fortune in their stars. Abraham ibn Ezra read Moses to warn the Israelites in [...] that they might forget that they were slaves with downcast hearts, forget the affliction and the hunger that they experienced in the wilderness, and forget that God sustained them nonetheless. But Ibn Ezra {{read the words}} [...] "But you shall remember" [...] in [...] to teach that if the thought [...] "My power and the might of my hand has gotten me this wealth" [...] should enter one's mind, then one should remember the One Who gives one power.|$|E
