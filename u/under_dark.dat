He himself took {{the office of}} minister for foreign affairs, and upon the retirement of Marshal Soult, he became prime minister. His first care was the maintenance of peace and the restoration of amicable relations with the other powers of Europe. His success gave unity and strength to the conservative party, who now {{felt that they had}} a great leader at their head.|$|E
25|$|The North America Nebula (NGC 7000) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{well-known}} nebulae in Cygnus, because it is visible to the unaided eye <b>under</b> <b>dark</b> skies, as a bright patch in the Milky Way. However, its characteristic shape is only visible in long-exposure photographs – it is difficult to observe in telescopes because of its low surface brightness. It has low surface brightness because it is so large; at its widest, the North America Nebula is 2 degrees across. Illuminated by a hot embedded star of magnitude 6, NGC 7000 is 1500 light-years from Earth.|$|E
25|$|As the Milky Way {{runs through}} Puppis, {{there are a}} large number of open {{clusters}} in the constellation. M46 and M47 are two open clusters in the same binocular field. M47 can be seen with the naked eye <b>under</b> <b>dark</b> skies, and its brightest stars are 6th magnitude. Messier 93 (M93) is another open cluster somewhat to the south. NGC 2451 is a very bright open cluster containing the star c Puppis and the near NGC 2477 is a good target for small telescopes. The star Pi Puppis is the main component of a bright group of stars known as Collinder 135.|$|E

25|$|M39 (NGC 7092) is an {{open cluster}} 950 light-years from Earth that is visible to the unaided eye <b>under</b> <b>dark</b> skies. It is loose, with about 30 stars {{arranged}} over a wide area; their conformation appears triangular. The brightest stars of M39 are of the 7th magnitude. Another open cluster in Cygnus is NGC 6910, also called the Rocking Horse Cluster, possessing 16 stars with a diameter of 5 arcminutes visible in a small amateur instrument; it is of magnitude 7.4. The brightest of these are two gold-hued stars, which represent {{the bottom of the}} toy it is named for. A larger amateur instrument reveals 8 more stars, nebulosity to the east and west of the cluster, and a diameter of 9 arcminutes. The nebulosity in this region is part of the Gamma Cygni Nebula. The other stars, approximately 3700 light-years from Earth, are mostly blue-white and very hot.|$|E
500|$|Learning of the encounter, Edward led the Yorkist main army to {{the bridge}} and was forced into a gruelling battle; {{although}} the Yorkists were superior in numbers, the narrow bridge was a bottleneck, forcing them to confront Clifford's men on equal terms. Edward sent Fauconberg and his horsemen to ford the river at Castleford, which should have been guarded by Henry Earl of Northumberland, but he arrived late, by which time the Yorkists had crossed the ford and were heading to attack the Lancastrians at Ferrybridge from the side. The Lancastrians retreated but were chased to Dinting Dale where they were all killed. Clifford was slain by an arrow to his throat. Having cleared the vicinity of enemy forces, the Yorkists repaired the bridge and pressed onwards to camp overnight at Sherburn-in-Elmet. The Lancastrian army marched to Tadcaster, approximately [...] north of Towton, and made camp there. [...] As dawn broke on the next day, the two rival armies packed up their camps <b>under</b> <b>dark</b> skies and in strong winds. [...] Although it was Palm Sunday, a day of holy significance to Christians, the forces prepared for the battle ahead. As a result of this, a few documents named the engagement as the Battle of Palme Sonday Felde, but the name did not gain wide acceptance. [...] Popular opinion favoured naming the battle after the village of Towton because of the battlefield's proximity to the settlement, which was the most prominent in the area at that time.|$|E

2500|$|M48 (NGC 2548) is an {{open cluster}} that is {{visible to the naked}} eye <b>under</b> <b>dark</b> skies. Its shape has been {{described}} as [...] "triangular"; this 80-star cluster is unusually large, more than half a degree in diameter, larger than the diameter of the full Moon.|$|E
2500|$|M35 (NGC 2168) is a large, {{elongated}} {{open cluster}} of magnitude 5, [...] {{discovered in the}} year 1745 by Swiss astronomer Philippe Loys de Chéseaux. It has an area of approximately 0.2 square degrees, {{the same size as}} the full Moon. Its high magnitude means that M35 is visible to the unaided eye <b>under</b> <b>dark</b> skies; under brighter skies it is discernible in binoculars. The 200 stars of M35 are arranged in chains that curve throughout the cluster; it is 2800 light-years from Earth. Another open cluster in Gemini is NGC 2158. Visible in large amateur telescopes and very rich, it is more than 12,000 light-years from Earth.|$|E
