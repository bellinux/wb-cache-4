5|$|From its {{discovery}} in 1875 until {{the era of}} semiconductors, the primary uses of gallium were high-temperature thermometrics and metal alloys with unusual properties of stability or ease of melting (some such being liquid at room temperature). The development of gallium arsenide as a direct band gap semiconductor in the 1960s <b>ushered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> most important stage in the applications of gallium.|$|E
5|$|Previous PRR {{stations}} were generally in the picturesque eclectic style common among 19th century railroads stations, like the Victorian eclectic Overbrook {{station and the}} Furness-style Broad Street Station. Germantown Junction was the first station along the Northeast Corridor to be constructed in the Châteauesque style, and it <b>ushered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Beaux Arts style used by the Pennsylvania and other railroads during the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|During the American Civil War, Indianapolis {{served as}} a {{gathering}} place for organizing troops. As Indianapolis's citizens rallied {{in support of the}} Union, its population increased with the arrival of new businesses and industries that offered additional employment opportunities and spurred real estate development. City residents experienced rising prices and wartime hardships, such as food and clothing shortages. It was also a time of bitter political disputes between Indiana's Democrats and Republicans. The Civil War era <b>ushered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the city's urban, industrial development, its connections to an expanding railroad network, and the growth of local charitable organizations.|$|E

5|$|Gabriel Ramanantsoa, a {{major general}} in the army, was {{appointed}} interim president and prime minister that same year, but low public approval forced him to step down in 1975. Colonel Richard Ratsimandrava, appointed to succeed him, was assassinated six days into his tenure. General Gilles Andriamahazo ruled after Ratsimandrava for four months before being replaced by another military appointee: Vice Admiral Didier Ratsiraka, who <b>ushered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> socialist-Marxist Second Republic that ran under his tenure from 1975 to 1993.|$|E
5|$|The early 18th century <b>ushered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rule of Kanthirava Narasaraja II, who, {{being both}} deaf and mute, ruled under the regency {{of a series}} of army chiefs (Delavoys) all of whom hailed from a single family from the village of Kalale in the Nanjangud taluk (or sub-district) of Mysore. Upon the ruler's death in 1714 at the age of 41, his son, Dodda Krishnaraja I, still two weeks shy of his 12th birthday, succeeded him.|$|E
5|$|The station {{opened in}} the 1870s and was known as New York Junction and Germantown Junction. A new station, which <b>ushered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Beaux-Arts style for large train stations, was built from 1896 to 1901. After a 1912–1915 enlargement, it was renamed as North Philadelphia. Despite several other renovations, its use {{declined}} in the mid and late 20th century; in 1991, Amtrak constructed a smaller replacement station across the tracks. The building was renovated once more in 1999 and is now used as commercial space. It {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places the same year.|$|E

5|$|Tsiranana's ouster <b>ushered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> socialist Second Republic under Admiral Didier Ratsiraka in 1975, but the {{ineffectiveness}} of the regime's philosophy soon fomented popular disillusionment. Persistent {{in their}} exposure of political problems like corruption {{and abuse of}} power under Ratsiraka, Mahaleo repeatedly saw their songs banned from the radio. The band successfully countered efforts at censorship by encouraging their fans to produce and distribute bootlegged recordings of their concerts. They continued to gain in popularity, regularly performing live shows across Madagascar and launching frequent tours {{to play for the}} Malagasy diaspora in major French population centers like Paris, Toulouse and Marseille.|$|E
5|$|During the war, the city's {{population}} {{increased with}} the arrival of new businesses and industries that offered additional employment opportunities, spurred real estate development, and <b>ushered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the city's urban, industrial development. In addition, street crime was prevalent, causing the city government to increase its police force and local merchants to hire private security. The era was also a time of bitter political disputes between Indiana's Democrats and Republicans. In May 1863, in an incident sarcastically called the Battle of Pogue's Run, Union soldiers stopped and searched two departing trainloads of delegates to a statewide Democratic convention, many of whom tossed their personal weapons into a nearby creek. In July 1863 Indianapolis residents feared an attack from Confederate forces during Morgan's Raid into southern Indiana, but the Confederates turned east toward Ohio and never came to the city.|$|E
5|$|George Orwell's book The Road to Wigan Pier was {{illustrated}} by {{a photograph of}} homes in the Rosehall area of Coatbridge. In 1934 there was an exodus to Corby in England when the local Union Plant relocated. This {{had the effect of}} a hammer blow impact on the town's iron industry and <b>ushered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end of serious iron production. The decline of the Clydeside shipbuilding industry in the 1950s meant the demand for iron finally collapsed. A legacy of 'devastating' unemployment, appalling housing conditions and some of the worst overcrowding in Scotland left its stamp on the Coatbridge of the early 1930s. As late as 1936 Coatbridge was the most overcrowded place in Scotland.|$|E

5|$|Under {{the newly}} formed Kingdom of Great Britain, output from the Royal Society and other English {{initiatives}} combined with the Scottish Enlightenment to create innovations in science and engineering, while the enormous growth in British overseas trade protected by the Royal Navy {{paved the way for}} the establishment of the British Empire. Domestically it drove the Industrial Revolution, a period of profound change in the socioeconomic and cultural conditions of England, resulting in industrialised agriculture, manufacture, engineering and mining, as well as new and pioneering road, rail and water networks to facilitate their expansion and development. The opening of Northwest England's Bridgewater Canal in 1761 <b>ushered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> canal age in Britain. In 1825 the world's first permanent steam locomotive-hauled passenger railway—the Stockton and Darlington Railway—opened to the public.|$|E
5|$|Waterloo was {{a decisive}} battle {{in more than}} one sense. Every {{generation}} in Europe up to the outbreak of the First World War looked back at Waterloo as the turning point that dictated the course of subsequent world history. In retrospect, it was seen as the event that <b>ushered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Concert of Europe, an era characterised by relative peace, material prosperity and technological progress. The battle definitively ended the series of wars that had convulsed Europe, and involved many other regions of the world, since the French Revolution of the early 1790s. It also ended the First French Empire and the political and military career of Napoleon Bonaparte, one of the greatest commanders and statesmen in history.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, Istanbul had {{established}} itself as a regional artistic center, with Turkish, European, and Middle Eastern artists flocking to the city. Despite efforts to make Ankara Turkey's cultural heart, Istanbul had the country's primary institution of art until the 1970s. When additional universities and art journals were founded in Istanbul during the 1980s, artists formerly based in Ankara moved in. Beyoğlu has been transformed into the artistic center of the city, with young artists and older Turkish artists formerly residing abroad finding footing there. Modern art museums, including İstanbul Modern, the Pera Museum, Sakıp Sabancı Museum and SantralIstanbul, opened in the 2000s to complement the exhibition spaces and auction houses that have already contributed to the cosmopolitan nature of the city. These museums have yet to attain the popularity of older museums on the historic peninsula, including the Istanbul Archaeology Museums, which <b>ushered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> era of modern museums in Turkey, and the Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum.|$|E

5|$|The Mongols {{eventually}} {{gained the}} upper hand under Möngke Khan, famed for his battles in Russia and Hungary in Eastern Europe, and <b>ushered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final destruction of the ruling Ch'oe family of Korea in 1258. In 1252 Möngke commissioned his younger brother Kublai to conquer the Kingdom of Dali in the southwest (modern Yunnan province), which was a successful campaign from the summer of 1253 to early 1254. Möngke also sent a military campaign into northern Vietnam (which was a failure). Möngke sent his renowned general and brother Hulagu west to face Syria and Egypt, after he had sacked and razed medieval Baghdad {{to the ground in}} 1258 during the sack of Baghdad, bringing an end to the Abbasid Caliphate and the Islamic Golden Age. Meanwhile, Möngke infiltrated Song territory further, until he died while battling the Song Chinese at Diaoyu Fortress, Chongqing on August 11, 1259. There are several different claims as to how he died; the causes of death include either an arrow wound from a Chinese archer during the siege, dysentery, or cholera epidemic. Whatever the cause, his death halted the invasion of the Southern Song, and sparked a succession crisis that would ultimately favor Kublai Khan as the new Khaghan of the Mongols. Möngke's death in battle also led to the recall of the main Mongol armies led by Hulagu campaigning in the Middle East. Hulagu had to travel back to Mongolia in order to partake in the traditional tribal meeting of the khuriltai to appoint a new successor of the Mongol Khanate. In Hulagu's absence, the emboldened Mamluks of Egypt were ready to face the Mongols. Mongol forces under Christian Kitbuqa's command were defeated in a decisive blow at Ain Jalut. This marked the extent of Mongol conquests west, but in the east, the Song dynasty had to be dealt with.|$|E
