5|$|The stadium {{was one of}} the venues for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Because of FIFA rules, it {{was called}} Arena de SÃ£o Paulo during the tournament. The stadium hosted the opening {{ceremony}} followed by the opening match between Brazil and Croatia, three other group stage matches, a Round 16 match and a semi-final. Because of the request of at least 65,000 seats for the World Cup opening match, temporary seats were added to the stadium for the tournament, although the final <b>usable</b> <b>capacity</b> only reached 62,200 for the opening match.|$|E
25|$|The {{capacity}} of an alkaline battery is strongly {{dependent on the}} load. An AA-sized alkaline battery might have an effective {{capacity of}} 3000mAh at low drain, but at a load of 1 ampere, which is common for digital cameras, the capacity could be as little as 700mAh. The voltage of the battery declines steadily during use, so the total <b>usable</b> <b>capacity</b> depends on the cut-off voltage of the application. Unlike Leclanche cells, the alkaline cell delivers about as much capacity on intermittent or continuous light loads. On a heavy load, capacity is reduced on continuous discharge compared with intermittent discharge, but the reduction is less than for Leclanche cells.|$|E

2500|$|Any {{block size}} could be {{specified}} {{up to the}} maximum track length. [...] Since the block headers occupied space, the <b>usable</b> <b>capacity</b> of the drive was dependent on the block size. [...] Blocks ("records" [...] in IBM's terminology) of 88, 96, 880 and 960 were often used because they related to the fixed block size of 80- and 96-character punch cards. The drive capacity was usually stated under conditions of full track record blocking. For example, the 100-megabyte 3336 disk pack only achieved that capacity with a full track block size of 13,030 bytes.|$|E

Existing CAC schemes do not consider the impact of mobility at vehicular speeds when computing the <b>usable</b> link <b>capacity</b> and available resources. The main limitation of such CAC scheme is that when a mobile node moves at a slower speed and makes a connection request to the base station (BS), the BS evaluates the situation based on the currently available information. The BS in such cases, is short-sighted and often overestimates the available resources as it completely ignores the scenario when the SS reaches its top speed within a very short time after a CAC decision is made, causing a significant drop in usable throughput. In this paper, we address this limitation of existing WiMAX CAC schemes and propose a new CAC scheme that estimates the <b>usable</b> link <b>capacity</b> for WiMAX communication at vehicular speeds and uses this information while making a CAC decision. We also present a CAC scheme that takes the speed distribution model of a mobile node into account during the CAC decision making process.
