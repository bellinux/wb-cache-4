40|$|The urotensin II (UII) {{gene family}} {{consists}} of four paralogous genes called UII, UII-related peptide (<b>URP),</b> <b>URP</b> 1 and <b>URP</b> 2. UII and <b>URP</b> peptides exhibit the same cyclic hexapeptide core sequence (CFWKYC) while the N- and C-terminal regions are variable. UII, <b>URP</b> 1 and <b>URP</b> 2 mRNAs are differentially expressed within {{the central nervous system}} of teleost fishes, suggesting that they may exert distinct functions. Although the cardiovascular, ventilatory and locomotor effects of UII have been described in teleosts, much less is known regarding the physiological actions of <b>URPs.</b> The goal {{of the present study was}} to compare the central and peripheral actions of picomolar doses (5 - 500 pmol) of trout UII, <b>URP</b> 1 and <b>URP</b> 2 on cardio-ventilatory variables and locomotor activity in the unanesthetized trout. Compared to vehicle, intracerebroventricular injection of UII, <b>URP</b> 1 and <b>URP</b> 2 evoked a gradual increase in total ventilation (VTOT) reaching statistical significance for doses of 50 and 500 pmol of UII and <b>URP</b> 1 but for only 500 pmol of <b>URP</b> 2. In addition, UII, <b>URP</b> 1 and <b>URP</b> 2 provoked an elevation of dorsal aortic blood pressure (PDA) accompanied with tachycardia. All peptides caused an increase in locomotor activity (ACT), at a threshold dose of 5 pmol for UII and <b>URP</b> 1, and 50 pmol for <b>URP</b> 2. After intra-arterial (IA) injection, and in contrast to their central effects, only the highest dose of UII and <b>URP</b> 1 significantly elevated VTOT and ACT. UII produced a dose-dependent hypertensive effect with concomitant bradycardia while <b>URP</b> 1 increased PDA and heart rate after injection of only the highest dose of peptide. <b>URP</b> 2 did not evoke any cardio-ventilatory or locomotor effect after IA injection. Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that endogenous UII, <b>URP</b> 1 and <b>URP</b> 2 in the trout brain may act as neurotransmitters and/or neuromodulators acting synergistically or differentially to control the cardio-respiratory and locomotor systems.

40|$|Aims: To {{identify}} possible {{correlations of}} urethral retro-resistance pressure (<b>URP)</b> with clinically and urodynamically proven {{stress urinary incontinence}} and the outcome of anti-incontinence surgery. Materials and Methods: <b>URP</b> was measured using the Monitorr(c) system in women with clinically and urodynamically proven stress urinary incontinence without prolapse before and after anti-incontinence surgery (colposuspension n= 8, tension-free vaginal tape n= 6, tension-free transobturator tape n= 34). Results: Fourty-eight women (mean age 61. 8 &# 61617; 8. 9 years) were evaluated preoperatively and on average 10 weeks postoperatively. Mean <b>URP</b> was 75. 6 &# 61617; 20. 8 cm H 2 O preoperatively versus 75. 4 &# 61617; 17. 9 cm H 2 O postoperatively (p= 0. 898). The type of anti-incontinence surgery performed had no significant effect on postoperative <b>URP.</b> While no association was found between age and <b>URP</b> (p= 0. 35), there was {{a positive correlation between}} <b>URP</b> and body mass index (BMI; r = 0. 49, p = 0. 0004). There was no correlation of <b>URP</b> with the preoperative pad test (p = 0. 17) and urethral closure pressure at rest (p= 0. 51).

40|$|AbstractIn {{a concerted}} effort to {{identify}} biomarkers for lung and colon carcinomas by genome-wide transcriptional profiling, we describe the identification and cloning of one such gene as well as two additional closely related genes. Due to the strong sequence homology to the C. elegans UNC- 112 we call this gene <b>URP</b> 1, for UNC- 112 related protein. We have also isolated the full-length clones for another novel related gene, <b>URP</b> 2 and the previously discovered MIG- 2 gene. Collectively, these proteins, together with two from Drosophila, appear to form a novel membrane-associated FERM and PH domain-containing protein family. Transcriptional analysis shows that only <b>URP</b> 1 is significantly differentially regulated, being over-expressed in 70 % of the colon carcinomas and 60 % of the lung carcinomas tested. Quantification of <b>URP</b> 1 expression by qRT-PCR showed up-regulation of the gene by 60 -fold in lung tumors and up to nearly 6 -fold in colon tumors. Northern blot analysis of <b>URP</b> 1 indicates that normal expression is restricted to neuromuscular tissues. In contrast, the expression of <b>URP</b> 2 appears to be confined primarily to tissues of the immune system. SNP analysis of <b>URP</b> 1 reveals that it is highly polymorphic, containing seven sites, four of which are in the coding region and one position that results in the interchangeable substitution of glutamic acid and lysine. Finally, we have shown that the genomic structure for all three genes is nearly identical with all encoded by 15 exons although <b>URP</b> 1 gene localized to chromosome 20 p 13, <b>URP</b> 2 to 11 q 12 and MIG- 2 to 14 q 22.

Accordingly, introduction of a similar substitution at the intracyclic Tyr residue in UII and <b>URP</b> led to compounds with divergent pharmacologic profiles.

Here, we have compared {{the mechanism of}} action of <b>URP</b> and UII on cultured astrocytes. Competition experiments performed with [125 I]UII showed the presence of very high- and high-affinity binding sites for UII, and a single high-affinity site for <b>URP.</b> Both UII and <b>URP</b> provoked a membrane depolarization accompanied by a decrease of input resistance, stimulated the release of endozepines, neuropeptides specifically produced by astroglial cells, and generated an increase in cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca 2 +]c). The UII/URP-induced [Ca 2 +]c elevation was pertussis toxin (PTX) -insensitive, and was blocked by the PLC inhibitor U 73122 or the IP 3 channel blocker 2 -APB. The addition of Ca 2 + chelator EGTA reduced the peak and abolished the plateau phase whereas the T-type calcium channel blocker mibefradil totally inhibited the calcium response evoked by both peptides. However, <b>URP</b> and UII induced a mono- and biphasic dose-dependent increase in [Ca 2 +]c and provoked short- and long-lasting Ca 2 + mobilization, respectively. Similar mono- and biphasic dose-dependent increase in [3 H]inositol incorporation into polyphosphoinositides (PIP) in astrocytes was obtained but sole the effect of UII was significantly reduced by PTX, although BRET experiments revealed that both UII and <b>URP</b> recruited Go protein.

In this study, we investigated (1) {{the presence of}} a functional urotensin-II (U-II) receptor (UT) in rat heart nuclear extracts and (2) the propensity of U-II and U-II-related peptide (<b>URP)</b> to cross the plasma membrane in a receptor-independent manner. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Biochemical and pharmacological methods including competitive binding assays, photoaffinity labelling, immunoblotting as well as de novo RNA synthesis were used to characterize the presence of functional UT receptors in rat heart nuclei. In addition, confocal microscopy and flow cytometry analysis were used to investigate the cellular uptake of fluorescent U-II and <b>URP</b> derivatives. KEY RESULTS The presence of specific U-II binding sites was demonstrated in rat heart nuclear extracts. Moreover, such subcellular localization was also observed in monkey heart extracts. In vitro transcription initiation assays on rat, freshly isolated, heart nuclei suggested that nuclear UT receptors are functional, and that U-II, but not <b>URP,</b> participates in nuclear UT-associated gene expression. Surprisingly, hU-II and <b>URP</b> efficiently crossed the plasma membrane in a receptor-independent mechanism involving endocytosis through caveolin-coated pits; this uptake of hU-II, but not that of <b>URP,</b> was dependent on extracellular pH.
