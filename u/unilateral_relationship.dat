It demonstrates the weak superiority of in-kind-transfers for a <b>unilateral</b> <b>relationship</b> between two agents. In particular, it proves that, {{under conditions of}} perfect knowledge and necessary selfenforcement of contracts, both agents are at least not worse off by in-kind-transfers compared to monetary payments when no selfenforcing contract exists which,is based on monetary payments. This result holds for finitely and for infinitely repeated games. ...|$|E

Politics and democracy are much more than institutional, representative politics, and therefore contemporary activists and movements such as 15 M are not anti-political, but challenge a particular view of democratic politics as representative politics...|$|E
40|$|The goal of. {{the study}} was to {{determine}} whether reciprocal friendships among preschool children are more stable over extended time intervals than are uni-lateral relationships. Thus, preschoolers named and cited reasons for liking their two closest friends in an initial testing session and again in a 4 - to 6 -month follow-up. Mutual friendships were also verified through observa-tion of free play in the classroom. Although only one <b>unilateral</b> <b>relationship</b> remained constant across the two testing sessions, two-thirds of the reciprocal relationships remained stable. In terms of the bases cited for liking, significant differences were evident between reciprocal and unilateral relationsnips for the dimensions of general play and common activities. The findings are dis-cussed in terms of Cooney and Selman's (1978) stage model. which assumes that friendship during early childhood is highly transitory.

In addition, <b>unilateral</b> <b>relationships</b> were discovered to run between variables in this study. This therefore implies that by increasing the amount of money supply in the economy, improving the functions of financial institutions and intermediaries, and improving the investment environment of Cameroon will boost economic growth, which will eventually lead to economic development.|$|R
40|$|The psychodynamic {{patterns}} of personality of children born with congenital ob-structions in the alimentary tract {{were compared with}} those of normal children in later childhood. The congenital anomalies had required surgery within the first 4 months of life. The psychodynamic patterns were elicited by 4 projective tech-niques. Information regarding the mothers ' emotional stability and attitudes was gathered by means of 3 paper-and-pencil inventories. The results suggested that there is no <b>unilateral</b> <b>relationship</b> between trauma in early infancy and signs of emotional disturbance in later childhood. A HE AIM of the investigation was to study the relationship between trauma in early infancy and the psychodynamic pattern of personality in childhood as in-dicated by projective techniques. Trau-ma in this study is defined as a disrup-tion of the basic normal pattern of gas-trointestinal activity (hunger, feeding, defecation, and sleeping) due to con-genital obstructions in the alimentary tract, requiring surgical repair within the first 4 months of life.

30|$|Turning to the {{underlying}} institutions, {{we find that the}} length of the statutory paid family leave can “explain” almost half of the cross-country variation in gender unemployment gaps among the temporary leave countries. In contrast, the permanent withdrawal countries, where gender role attitudes rooted in traditional family culture are strong and widespread, have only very short or no paid family leaves. The perceived prevalence of gender discrimination varies substantially in permanent withdrawal countries and turns out to be strongly positively correlated with the size of gender unemployment gaps there. While the two <b>unilateral</b> <b>relationships</b> cannot be interpreted as causal, they are consistent with the main conclusions that follow from our data decompositions. We further support our account of the variation in gender unemployment gaps across the EU with a regression of gender unemployment gaps on the duration of paid family leave for 17 countries over the last 25 years, with country and year fixed effects. Based on this country-level analysis, extending the duration of paid family leave by 1 year leads to an increase in gender unemployment gap by 0.865 p.p.|$|R

40|$|For children, {{high quality}} friendships are {{associated}} with adaptive social, emotional and academic functioning. There is also evidence that children experience real and imaginary friendships in similar ways, and that imagined relationships could {{have an impact on}} development. However, less is known about the relationships made possible by virtual agents in digital media. This dissertation research was designed to provide preliminary data about children’s concepts of virtual agents, and the social opportunities they attribute to such entities. In Studies 1 and 2 (combined N = 48), preschool aged children differentiated the social affordances of a stuffed dog and a virtual dog. Participants played a game in which they guessed whether a child in a video was referring to a stuffed dog or a virtual dog in a series of statements. Items designed to assess high quality friendships, such as comfort, protection and love, were attributed more to the stuffed dog than the virtual dog. Studies 3 and 4 examined adult and child concepts of a virtual child, and how concepts of this entity might differ from a real child, a child on a video chat program (e. g., Skype™) and an inanimate doll. Adults and children attributed a range of properties to each child agent, including biological, psychological and social properties, as well as opportunities for relationships. In Study 3 (N = 144), adults did not differentiate between the virtual child and the doll on the social property; however, they favored the doll on opportunities for <b>unilateral</b> <b>relationships.</b> In Study 4 (N = 30), five to eight-year-old children indicated an overall preference for the doll on the social property, as well as on opportunities for reciprocal relationships. Children also favored the doll on opportunities for love, companionship, and intimate disclosure. Altogether, these findings suggest that virtual agents afford more limited social opportunities than inanimate artifacts, and {{they are less likely to}} be loved by children and adults alike. These results raise important questions about the design goals for virtual agents, and the functions they are intended to serve in our everyday lives.

40|$|This paper investigates and {{analyzes}} the long-run equilibrium {{relationship between the}} Thai stock Exchange Index (SETI) and selected macroeconomic variables using monthly time series data that cover a 20 -year period from January 1990 to December 2009. The following macroeconomic variables are included in our analysis: money supply (MS), {{the consumer price index}} (CPI), interest rate (IR) and the industrial production index (IP) (as a proxy for GDP). Our findings prove that the SET Index and the selected macroeconomic variables are cointegrated at I (1) and have a significant equilibrium relationship over the long run. Money supply demonstrates a strong positive relationship with the SET Index over the long run, whereas the industrial production index and consumer price index show negative long-run relationships with the SET Index. Furthermore, in non-equilibrium situations, the error correction mechanism suggests that the consumer price index, industrial production index and money supply each contribute in some way to restore equilibrium. In addition, using Toda and Yamamoto’s augmented Granger causality test, we identify a bi-causal relationship between industrial production and money supply and <b>unilateral</b> causal <b>relationships</b> between CPI and IR, IP and CPI, MS and CPI, and IP and SETI, indicating that all of these variables are sensitive to Thai stock market movements.

The results {{show that there is}} long-term balanced relationship between change of farmland quantity and policy of farmland protection, and there is a certain mechanism restricting motion of variables between the two so as to make the two deviate from each other little and step towards balance in the long run; there is <b>unilateral</b> causality <b>relationship</b> between farmland change and policy of farmland protection, namely that the farmland change is the Granger cause of policy of farmland protection, while policy of farmland protection is not the Granger cause of farmland change; impulse response and variance decomposition indicate that farmland change plays the role of promoting policy of farmland protection continuously, and the role is strengthened along with prolonged lag period; the policy of farmland protection has strong inertia, because it is impacted by the former level of itself, and the policy of farmland protection plays insignificant role in promoting farmland quantity. Consequently, the important approach of solving problem of rapid decrease of farmland is to formulate long-term strategy, strengthen theoretical research of farmland protection and reinforce degree of formulation, implementation and surveillance of farmland protection policy.

50|$|There is {{considerable}} empirical activity {{related to the}} social identity approach. Allocator studies have frequently been employed to understand group-based trust in strangers. They may be operationalised as <b>unilateral</b> or bilateral <b>relationships</b> of exchange. General social categories such as university affiliation, course majors, and even ad-hoc groups {{have been used to}} distinguish between in-group and out-group members. In unilateral studies of trust, the participant would be asked to choose between envelopes containing money that was previously allocated by an in-group or out-group member. They would have had no prior or future opportunities for interaction, simulating Brewer’s notion that group membership was sufficient in bringing about group-based trust and hence cooperation. Participants could expect an amount ranging from nothing to the maximum value an allocator could give out. In bilateral studies of trust have employed an investment game devised by Berg and colleagues where individuals could choose to give a portion or none of their money to another. Any amount given would be tripled and the receiver would then decide on whether they would return the favour by giving money back to the sender. Trusting behaviour {{on the part of the}} sender and the eventual trustworthiness of the receiver was exemplified through the giving of money.|$|R

This study extended quantitative examination of the limbic system through development and validation of volumetric protocols to measure the ErC and PrC. MethodsVolumes were calculated from MRI studies using ANALYZE 7. 5 and based on detailed anatomical definitions developed for the study. Subjects were 61 temporal lobe epilepsy patients with mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS: 33 left, 28 right) and 20 neurologically normal controls. Inter-rater reliabilities for the ErC and PrC volume protocols {{were found to be}} high (range 0. 86 – 0. 92). ResultsIpsilateral hippocampal volume was reduced in patients with MTS, while contralateral volume did not differ significantly from controls. In the patients, rhinal cortex volumes were reduced as a function of laterality of disease. The pattern of correlations between ErC and PrC differed between disease groups. Hippocampal and rhinal cortex volumes were not significantly correlated. A significant four-way interaction was found between side of MTS, hemisphere, structure and handedness. ConclusionsThis quantitative study demonstrates reliable in vivo evidence of morphometric changes in ErC and PrC in a substantial number of patients with <b>unilateral</b> MTS.

40|$|Background: Sprinting {{and jumping}} is an {{important}} physical part of soccer. Games are often won or lost cause of this two factors. Also the ability to sprint, how often you can sprint and how well you can sprint late in a game is what differ between the absolute world class players and other top class players. A players ability to produce power affects the players ability to sprint and jump. Power production can be tested as well as trained with plyometric exercises. Two plyometric exercises commonly used to test players abilities are the counter movement jump and the drop jump which can be performed either <b>unilateral</b> or bilateral. <b>Relationships</b> between bilateral counter movement jump and sprint is well established. But the <b>relationship</b> between <b>unilateral</b> countermovement jumps and unilateral drop jumps and sprint are not as well examined. Aim:  The {{aim of this study}} is to examine which one of the two tests, unilateral CMJ and unilateral DJ, that have the highest correlation with short sprinting. Method: 14 male junior soccer players playing on a high national junior level participated in this study. Two blocks of sprints was performed, 0 - 15 m and 0 - 30 m with time measured on every 5 m. Two trials of unilateral countermovement jumps and unilateral dropjumps was performed on the subjects dominant leg. Spearman’s two-tailed correlation test was used and a value of > ± 0. 6 was considered to be a strong correlation. Results: 10 subjects attended both the sprint and jump trials. No strong correlations was found. The highest relationships was that between unilateral counter movement jump and 0 - 30 m sprint (rs = - 0, 30) and that between unilateral drop jump and time between 20 - 30 m sprint (rs = 0, 30). No strong correlations was found. Conclusion: The results showed no strong relationships between the jumps and any of the sprint distances. Therefore neither of the jumps can be said to better predict sprint performance on any distances up to 30 m. Neither can the results from this study be of use to recommend any of the jumps before the other in training as plyometric exercises to improve performance on the acceleration phase or the top-speed phase...|$|R
40|$|Owing to {{the growing}} {{application}} of diverse teams in today’s organizations, understanding how intrateam differences influence the functioning of teams {{has become a major}} topic of interest in social and organizational psychology. The conventional focus of research has been to investigate how the diversity in teams or individuals’ dissimilarity {{from the rest of the}} team influences the performance of teams. The research in this dissertation departs from these team-level and individual-level investigations of intrateam differences. Instead, we focus on the dyadic level of analysis by investigating to what extent perceptions of expertise dissimilarity within pairs of individuals are related to team members’ behavior and team performance. In Chapter 1, we review previous research on the relation between intrateam differences and the functioning of teams. This overview shows that scholars have not yet produced a clear and consistent pattern of results that supports the idea that intrateam differences either positively or negatively affect team member behavior and team performance. We propose that insight into the relation between intrateam differences and the functioning of teams in past research may have been obscured in three ways. First, because researchers have primarily conceptualized and measured intrateam differences as a team level or an individual level construct, they may have failed to notice important variance due to the differences within pairs of team members. Second, because researchers mainly used objective measurements of intrateam differences, it is unclear to what extent individuals in teams actually perceive their objective differences with others. Third, because previous research may have been too narrowly focused on paradigms that suggest that people prefer to work with similar others in homogeneous teams, it is unclear how positively or negatively individuals actually evaluate their subjective differences with others. In Chapter 2, we report a first empirical study that investigates what kinds of differences team members perceive when they cooperate in projects teams and how negatively or positively team members evaluate these differences. We report the results of a qualitative study among 80 members of 15 diverse teams in a governmental institution. Multidimensional scale analysis shows that five types of differences are salient to the individuals in this sample: differences related to extraversion, task-related expertise, work pose, approach to work, and seniority. In addition, the results suggest that team members tend to contrast positive and negative evaluations of differences related to extraversion and approaches to work, but to conceptualize positive and negative evaluations of task-related expertise, seniority, and work pose as more mutually independent phenomena. Chapter 3 builds on the finding in Chapter 2 that members of project teams sometimes value the same task-related expertise both negatively and positively. Specifically, this study introduces the concept of perceived expertise complementarity as a phenomenon that is different from perceived expertise dissimilarity. We hypothesize that perceived expertise complementarity is positively, whereas perceived expertise dissimilarity is negatively related to self- and peer-rated dyadic helping in teams. To test these hypotheses we compare the effects of perceptions of expertise complementarity and expertise dissimilarity in a sample of 301 <b>unilateral</b> work <b>relationships</b> within 20 student research teams by using the social relations model (Kenny, 1994). As expected, the results show that perceived expertise complementarity and perceived expertise dissimilarity have diverging effects. Whereas perceived expertise complementarity are positively related to self- and peer-rated dyadic helping, perceived expertise dissimilarity is unrelated to self- and peer-rated dyadic helping. Taken together, the results suggest that expertise complementarity and expertise dissimilarity are different constructs. Chapter 4 focuses on the antecedents and consequences of perceived expertise dissimilarity and perceived expertise complementarity. It is predicted that dyadic differences in educational background and educational level will determine to what extent team members will experience differences in expertise and complementarity in expertise. Moreover, we propose that that the within-team alignment between perceptions of expertise dissimilarity and expertise complementarity is predictive of the performance of teams. These expectations are tested in 69 R&D teams of a Dutch multinational organization. The results show that team members experience dissimilarity in expertise when another team member has a different educational background or a different educational level. Team members experience more complementarity in expertise to the extent that they have more organizational tenure and when another team member has a different educational background and a similar educational level. Regarding the team-level consequences, our expectation that intrateam alignment of perceptions of expertise dissimilarity and complementarity are positively related to team performance is confirmed. Chapter 5 gives an overview of the findings. We highlight that the study of intrateam differences can benefit from focusing on the dyadic level of analysis. In addition, we recommend that researchers concentrate more on perceptions and evaluation of differences as our findings show that these are important for understanding how individuals in teams react to intrateam differences. Further, an important conclusion of this research project is that scholars and practitioners need to distinguish between perceptions of expertise dissimilarity and expertise complementarity in order to be better able to understand and improve the performance of teams. This is illustrated with three implications for practice. ...|$|R
