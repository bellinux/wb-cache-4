5000|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} types of amputations that describe the location of the amputation. A transhumoral amputation is an above the elbow amputation. It is sometimes referred to as AE. A transradial amputation is a below the elbow amputation. A transfemoral amputation is an above the knee amputation, and is sometimes referred to as AK. [...] LEA is sometimes used to refer to lower limb amputations. A bilateral amputee is a person who is missing either both upper limbs or both lower limbs. People who are missing both legs below the knee are sometimes referred to as BK while people missing both arms below the below are referred as BE. Transtibial amputation is a below the knee amputation. A forequarter amputation includes the arm, shoulder, clavicle, and scapula. A partial foot amputation is when the metatarsal section of the foot is amputated. This is called a transmetatarsal amputation. A shoulder disarticulation, also called SD, is when an arm is amputated through the shoulder joint. A Symes amputation is an amputation in the foot at the heel that allows for the leg to bear weight. A <b>unilateral</b> <b>amputation</b> is a single amputation that effects only one side of the body. A wrist disarticulation, also called WD, is an amputation of the hand at the wrist.|$|E

40|$|Little {{research}} {{has described the}} long-term health outcomes of patients who had combat-related amputations or leg-threatening injuries. We conducted retrospective analysis of Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs health data for lower extremity combat-injured patients with (1) <b>unilateral</b> <b>amputation</b> within 90 days postinjury (early amputation, n = 440), (2) <b>unilateral</b> <b>amputation</b> more than 90 days postinjury (late amputation, n = 78), or (3) leg-threatening injuries without amputation (limb salvage, n = 107). Patient medical records were analyzed for four years postinjury. After adjusting for group differences, early amputation was generally associated with a lower or similar prevalence for adverse physical and psychological diagnoses (e. g., pain, osteoarthritis, posttraumatic stress disorder) versus late amputation and/or limb salvage. By contrast, early amputation was {{associated with an increased}} likelihood of osteoporosis during the first year postinjury. The prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder increased for all patient groups over four years postinjury, particularly in the second year. The different clinical outcomes among combat extremity injured patients treated with early amputation, late amputation, or limb salvage highlight their different healthcare requirements.

40|$|OBJECTIVE -The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{incidence}} of vascular lower- limb amputation (LLA) in the diabetic and nondiabetic general population. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -A population-based cohort study was conducted in a representative Swedish region. All vascular LLAs (at or proximal to the transmetatarsal level) performed from 1997 through 2006 were consecutively registered and classified into initial <b>unilateral</b> <b>amputation,</b> contralateral amputation, or reamputation. The incidence rates were estimated in the diabetic and nondiabetic general population aged = 45 years. RESULTS -During the 10 -year period, LLA was performed on 62 women and 71 men with diabetes and on 79 women and 78 men without diabetes. The incidence of initial <b>unilateral</b> <b>amputation</b> per 100, 000 person-years was 192 (95 % CI 145 - 241) for diabetic women, 197 (152 - 244) for diabetic men, 22 (17 - 26) for nondiabetic women, and 24 (19 - 29) for nondiabetic men. The incidence increased from the age of 75 years. Of all amputations, 74 % were transtibial. The incidences of contralateral amputation and of reamputation per 100 amputee- years in diabetic women amputees were 15 (7 - 27) and 16 (8 - 28), respectively; in diabetic men amputees 18 (10 - 29) and 21 (12 - 32); in nondiabetic women amputees 14 (7 - 24) and 18 (10 - 28); and in nondiabetic men amputees 13 (6 - 22) and 24 (15 - 35). CONCLUSIONS -In the general population aged = 45 years, the incidence of vascular LLA at or proximal to the transmetatarsal level is eight times higher in diabetic than in nondiabetic individuals.

40|$|Medical {{practitioners}} face {{difficult decisions}} {{over whether to}} amputate or to salvage a lower limb that has undergone trauma. To our knowledge, {{there has been little}} evidence reporting the impact of different surgical decisions on functional and mental health outcomes following intensive rehabilitation that might inform decision-making. Methods: This study is a retrospective, independent-group comparison of rehabilitation outcomes from a U. K. military complex trauma rehabilitation center. There were 100 procedures examined: 36 unilateral amputations (11 immediatebelow- the-knee amputations, 15 delayed below-the-knee amputations, and 10 immediate above-the-knee amputations), 43 bilateral amputations, and 21 single-limb salvages (including 13 below-the-knee limb salvages); the patients had a mean age (and standard deviation) of 29 ± 6 years and a mean New Injury Severity Score of 34 ± 15 points. The outcome measures at completion of rehabilitation included a 6 -minute walk test (6 MWT), Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre mobility and activities of daily living scores, screening for depression (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ- 9]) and general anxiety disorder (General Anxiety Disorder 7 -item scale [GAD- 7]), mental health support, and pain scores. Results: On completion of their rehabilitation, the <b>unilateral</b> <b>amputation</b> group walked significantly farther in 6 minutes (564 ± 92 m) than the limb-salvage group (483 ± 108 m; p 0. 05). The limb-salvage group was less capable of running independently compared with all amputee groups. No significant differences (p > 0. 05) were reported in mean mental health outcomes between the below-the-knee injury groups, and depression and anxiety scores were comparable with population norms. At discharge, 97 % of all patients were able to control their pain. Conclusions: After completing a U. K. military interdisciplinary rehabilitation program, the <b>unilateral</b> <b>amputation</b> group demonstrated a significant functional advantage over the limb-salvage and bilateral amputation groups. We found that patients electing for delayed amputation below the knee after attempted limb salvage achieved superior functional gains in mobility compared with patients who underwent limb salvage below the knee and experienced no functional disadvantage compared with patients who underwent immediate amputation. The mental health outcomes were comparable with general population norms, optimizing the prospect of full integration back into society...|$|E

30|$|There {{are some}} {{limitations}} to this study. First, we only investigated athletes with <b>unilateral</b> <b>amputation</b> {{who participated in}} elite-level competitions, such as the Paralympics and the International Paralympic Committee Athletics World Championship. Thus, caution {{needs to be taken}} regarding interpretation and generalization of these findings toward novice and non-expert level athletes. Second, our results are based on retrospective, not experimental, observations. A recent study (Funken et al. 2014) demonstrated that one left sided unilateral transfemoral amputee can run faster in a clockwise direction than in a counterclockwise direction on a curved track due to the asymmetric kinetics. Further, in the present study, stump length in each class and prosthetic knee joint used in Men T 42 may vary within each class of amputees. In addition, bilateral differences in strength, elasticity, leg length and balance control in unilateral amputees may induce excessive fatigue in sprinting on a curved track which might cause uneven energy consumption between the legs. Since these factors may affect 200 -m sprint performance, further research is required on whether and how sprint performance on a curved track can be affected by amputation side.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of speed and leg prostheses on mediolateral (ML) foot placement and its variability in sprinters with and without transtibial amputations. We hy-pothesized that ML foot placement variability would: 1. increase with running speed up to maximum speed and 2. be symmetrical between the legs of non-amputee sprinters but asymmetrically greater for the affected leg of sprinters with a unilateral transtibial amputa-tion. We measured the midline of the body (kinematic data) and center of pressure (kinetic data) in the ML direction while 12 non-amputee sprinters and 7 Paralympic sprinters with transtibial amputations (6 unilateral, 1 bilateral) ran across a range of speeds up to maxi-mum speed on a high-speed force measuring treadmill. We quantified ML foot placement relative to the body’s midline and its variability. We interpret our results with respect to a hy-pothesized relation between ML foot placement variability and lateral balance. We infer that greater ML foot placement variability indicates greater challenges with maintaining lateral balance. In non-amputee sprinters, ML foot placement variability for each leg increased substantially and symmetrically across speed. In sprinters with a <b>unilateral</b> <b>amputation,</b> M...|$|E
40|$|Objective:To {{assess the}} quality of life after {{treatment}} for limb-threatening ischaemia. Design:An open, prospective, observational study in a Vascular Unit of a University Hospital. Materials:One hundred and fifty consecutive patients presenting with actual or threatened tissue loss of the leg. Methods:A single, experienced observer assessed the patients for pain, mobility, anxiety, depression, self-care and lifestyle at presentation, 6 and 12 months later. Results:Six different treatment outcomes were recognised: successful angioplasty, successful thrombolysis/thrombectomy, successful surgical bypass, amputation after failed revascularisation, primary <b>unilateral</b> <b>amputation</b> and primary bilateral amputation. Pain was significantly improved in all groups (p< 0. 05) except for patients after failed revascularization (p = 0. 08). Mobility improved in patients who underwent angioplasty (p = 0. 05) or a successful surgical bypass (p = 0. 001). Anxiety and depression both improved significantly only after surgical reconstruction (p< 0. 02). Self-care ability improved significantly after angioplasty (p< 0. 05), surgical reconstruction (p< 0. 005) and unilateral primary amputation (p< 0. 05), but was unaltered in the other groups. Lifestyle significantly deteriorated following thrombolysis/thrombectomy and failed surgical reconstruction (p< 0. 05), but was maintained in all other groups. Conclusions:The treatment of limb-threatening ischaemia should aim to maintain pre-morbid lifestyle, an aim which is best achieved by limb-salvage.

During the present prospective cross-sectional study, 10 chronic leprotic patients with <b>unilateral</b> trans-tibial <b>amputation</b> were evaluated. The study was conducted in Tabriz Bababaghi and Imam Reza Hospitals at summer of 2008. Sensory nerve conduction (SNAP) and Compound Motor Action Potentials (CMAP) studies were performed in association with pedobarographic assessment. No reliable response was detected from tested sensory and motor nerves, except a very low amplitude finding in deep preoneal nerve of one patient. In comparing with healthy group, static total plantar area, dynamic total plantar area, static rarefoot peak pressure and dynamic rarefoot peak pressure were lower in leprotic patients (p = 0. 047, p = 0. 004, p = 0. 029 and p< 0. 001), while static forefoot peak pressure and dynamic forefoot peak pressure were higher in these patients (p = 0. 011 and p = 0. 031).

40|$|Objective: to {{investigate}} the changes associated with age in gait characteristics and dynamic weight bearing pattern of sound and prosthetic limb of persons with <b>unilateral</b> <b>amputation.</b> Participant: two groups of seven young (24 ± 3. 8 years) and seven elderly unilateral amputee (71 ± 6 years) were selected for this study. Setting: both groups walked at their self selected speed over a 20 second duration plane surface walk way in trans-tibial prosthesis with PTB socket and SACH foot. The raw data of force and EMG sensors of gait analyzer were filtered, processed and analyzed with help of ‘matlab 7. 0. A blue tooth enabled heart rate telemetry system was used for calculating gait efficiency in terms of physiological cost index (PCI). Results: {{significant differences were found}} in stride duration, (p= 0. 003), step duration sound limb (p< 0. 002), stance duration sound limb (p= 0. 002), stance duration prosthetic limb (p= 0. 006) and cadence (p= 0. 001 < 0. 05), however no difference was found in EMG pattern of vastus lateralis between the two groups. The dynamic weight distribution showed more normalized load on anterior parts of heel and minimum load at calcaneal max in elderly group. The results of vertical ground reaction force found the prosthetic side of elderly group takes more weight than young group during loading response.

ResultsTwenty-eight subjects (37 %) achieved mobility success, defined as returning to or exceeding a baseline level of mobility on the locomotor capability index (LCI- 5). Forty-three subjects (57 %) were satisfied with their mobility. Individuals who were 65 years of age and older (risk difference [RD] = − 0. 52; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: − 0. 75, − 0. 29), reported a current alcohol use disorder (RD = − 0. 37; 95 % CI: − 0. 48, − 0. 26), had a history of hypertension (RD = − 0. 23; 95 % CI: − 0. 43, − 0. 03) or treatment for anxiety or depression (RD = − 0. 39; 95 % CI: − 0. 50, − 0. 28) were less likely to achieve mobility success. Mobility success was associated with mobility satisfaction (RD = 0. 36; 95 % CI: 0. 20, 0. 53) and satisfaction with life (RD = 0. 28; 95 % CI: 0. 06, 0. 50).

S 135 -S 141 Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to use Raman {{spectroscopy}} to measure levels of CaPi in muscles under occlusal wear and treated with laser phototherapy (LPT) or muscle-relaxant therapy or both on rodents. Background: The etiology of temporomandibular disorders is multifactorial. Malocclusion may influence the masticatory muscles, causing fatigue. A major type of fatigue is the metabolic, caused by the increased accumulation of metabolites such as inorganic phosphate. Raman spectroscopy allows nondestructive analysis of the biochemical composition of tissues. Methods: The 30 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups: occlusal wear (G- 1), occlusal wear[*]+[*]LPT (G- 2), and occlusal wear[*]+[*]muscle relaxant (G- 3). Ten untreated animals were used for baseline data. Under intraperitoneal general anesthesia, animals of groups 1, 2, and 3 had <b>unilateral</b> <b>amputation</b> of molar cusps to simulate an occlusal-wear situation. The masseter muscle of G- 2 received LPT (λ 830 [*]nm, 4 [*]J/cm 2, 40 [*]mW, 2 [*]mm) after the procedure and repeated every other day for 14 – 30 days. Animals of G- 3 were treated with a daily injection of dantrolene (2. 5 [*]mg/kg in 0. 5 [*]ml of H 2 O) beginning 24 [*]h after cusp removal. Animals were killed with an overdose of general anesthetics at days 14 and 30 after cusps removal, and the ipsilateral masseter muscle was excised and divided into two parts. One part was routinely processed and underwent histologic analysis; the other was kept in liquid nitrogen for Raman spectroscopy. The mean value of the intensity of the peak 958 per centimeter was determined. Results: No morphologic changes were seen. Raman analysis showed significantly less Raman intensity in the laser group at 30 days (p[*]<[*] 0. 01). Conclusion: Occlusal wear did not caused morphologic alterations in the masseter muscle but resulted in changes of the levels of CaPi that were less compromising when the laser light was used...|$|E
40|$|The current {{prevalence}} of persons amputated at transmetatarsal level or higher in Sweden {{can be estimated}} to be between 5000 and 5500 persons (approx. 0. 06 % of the population). The majority of these are patients with vascular disease (≈ 80 %). In Sweden between 1000 and 1100 new amputees can be expect every year. Less than 5 % of all amputations will be related to causes other than vascular disease. Lower limb amputation (LEA) in patients with vascular disease may not only be highly disabling but also costly in hospital management. The incidence differs between countries due to age structure of the population, {{prevalence of}} vascular disease and the prevalence of diabetes. In Paper I we prospectively evaluated LLA performed at transmetatarsal level or higher during 10 years. The overall incidence of initial <b>unilateral</b> <b>amputation</b> in the diabetic population was eight times higher compared with that in the nondiabetic population (195 vs. 23 per 100, 000 person-years). The incidence of contralateral amputation among diabetic amputees was 17 and among the nondiabetic amputees 13 per 100 amputee-years. The most frequent contralateral amputation level among the diabetic and nondiabetic patients was trans-tibial. The incidence of re-amputation among the diabetic amputees was 19 and among the nondiabetic amputees 14 per 100 amputee-years. The most frequent re-amputation level among diabetic patients was trans-tibial and among nondiabetic patients was trans-femoral. The 1 -year mortality rate, adjusted for age and gender, {{did not differ significantly}} between the two groups. In Paper II we introduce a Swedish version of the Locomotor Capabilities Index (LCI) outcome instrument and evaluate its reliability and validity. Following the process of translation and cultural adaptation, the Swedish version of the LCI was found to be reliable and valid instrument that can provide a standardized measure of amputee-centered outcomes. In Paper III we tested two different dressings after trans-tibial amputation, the conventional rigid dressing of plaster of Paris and a new vacuum-formed removable rigid dressing. The primary outcome measure was time to prosthetic fitting while the secondary outcomes included function with the prosthesis 3 months after amputation measured with the LCI and the Timed “Up and Go” (TUG) test. Twenty-seven consecutive patients were included and prosthetic fitting was achieved in 23 patients (mean age 76 years). The same postoperative treatment and rehabilitation was applied in both groups. To minimize the possible influence of using different types of prostheses in measuring functional outcome ICEX prosthetic sockets were used in all patients. The new vacuum-formed removable rigid dressing appear to yield similar results regarding wound healing, time to prosthetic fitting and function, rate of socket changes during the first year or return to previous dwelling when compared with conventional plaster of Paris rigid dressing. In Paper IV we prospectively evaluated the outcome of a standardized surgical and rehabilitation program in trans-tibial amputation in a large consecutive and population-based series of 219 patients. We analyzed the outcome regarding rate of prosthetic fitting, walking ability and mortality. A circular, plaster of Paris rigid dressing was applied by the surgeon in the operating room. This rigid dressing was removed after 5 to 7 days and compression treatment with a silicone liner was started. Ambulation with an ischial weight bearing training prosthesis was started when the plaster of Paris dressing was removed, with no load on the residual limb. A prosthetic socket that is cast and made directly on the residual limb using pressure casting technique, resulting in a definitive socket was used. Functioning was defined as good if the patient wore the prosthesis daily and was able to walk alone or with assistance outdoors or alone indoors. Functioning was defined as poor if the patient did not wear the prosthesis daily and was unable to walk indoors without assistance or used a wheelchair most or all the time or did not receive prosthesis. All prostheses were produced and delivered on the same visit to the prosthetic workshop. More than half of all amputees could be fitted with a prosthesis after a median time of six weeks and almost two-thirds have good function 3 months after amputation and the functional status remained unchanged at 1 year. Poor functional outcomes correlated with delayed prosthetic fitting and not living independently before amputation. Of the patients who could walk with or without an aid prior to the amputation and who survived at least 90 days after amputation, more than 80 % could be provided with a prosthesis with 68 % achieving good function. These patients can expect a median survival of approximately 3. 5 years...|$|E

Results: Research of the observed swimmers with <b>unilateral</b> above-knee <b>amputation</b> showed that: when swimming the front crawl, the swimmers unequally balance the intense kick of right and left leg mainly using the abdominal muscles and subsequently also in the electric potential of different sizes in other observed muscles; when swimming the backstroke, the upper body muscles {{on the side of}} amputated limb do not show any different activity than the muscles of the opposite side; when swimming the breaststroke, the main propulsion muscle for locomotion through the shoulder girdle - m. latissimus dorsi is activated {{for a longer period of}} time on the side of amputated limb; thereby, electrical activity of the selected muscles is not symmetrical in the timeline.

40|$|This study {{compared}} the physical function and comfort level {{of patients with}} <b>unilateral</b> transtibial <b>amputation</b> after being fitted with a hand-cast Patella Tendon Bearing (PTB) socket and a pressure-cast (PCAST) hydrocast socket. The latter technique aims to reduce the skill dependency currently required for socket manufacture and fit. The study was conducted at the Vietnamese Training Centre for Orthopaedic Technologies and involved seventeen Vietnamese participants with <b>unilateral</b> transtibial <b>amputation,</b> {{all of whom were}} long term users of prosthetics. All participants were fitted with two sockets manufactured using both hand-cast and PCAST techniques with International Committee of the Red Cross components. Walking tests (timed up and go test and six-minute-walk-test), spatio-temporal gait analyses and subjective comfort assessments were completed after a short acclimatisation period with each socket. The participant-preferred socket was also noted. No significant differences were found for the measures of mobility, functional capacity, spatio-temporal gait parameters, gait symmetry, perceived comfort or participant socket preference. The results show the initial patient outcomes are similar when participants are fitted with a hand-cast PTB socket and a PCAST hydrocast sockets. Future work should confirm these findings in a longitudinal trial...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{possible}} relationship between factors modifiable by rehabilitation interventions (rehabilitation factors), other factors related to lower-limb loss (other factors), and high-level mobility as measured by the Comprehensive High-Level Activity Mobility Predictor (CHAMP) in servicemembers (SMs) with traumatic lower-limb loss. One-hundred eighteen male SMs with either <b>unilateral</b> transtibial <b>amputation</b> (TTA), <b>unilateral</b> transfemoral <b>amputation</b> (TFA), or bilateral lower-limb amputation (BLLA) participated. Stepwise regression analysis was used to develop separate regression models of factors predicting CHAMP score. Regression models containing both rehabilitation factors and other factors explained 81 % (TTA), 36 % (TFA), and 91 % (BLLA) of the variance in CHAMP score. Rehabilitation factors such as lower-limb strength and dynamic balance were found to be significantly related to CHAMP score and can be enhanced with the appropriate intervention. Further, the findings support the importance of salvaging the knee joint and its effect on high-level mobility capabilities. Lastly, the J-shaped energy storage and return feet were found to improve high-level mobility for SMs with TTA. These results could help guide rehabilitation and aid in developing appropriate interventions to assist in maximizing high-level mobility capabilities for SMs with traumatic lower-limb loss...|$|R

30|$|Despite {{the fact}} that several studies {{demonstrated}} ethnicity-related architectural and functional differences of the musculoskeletal system in able-bodied athletes (Fukashiro et al. 2002; Kunimasa et al. 2014; Rahmani et al. 2004), {{little is known about}} the ethnicity and athletic performance in athletes with lower extremity amputations. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the differences in spatiotemporal parameters of AS, CC, and WA sprinters with bilateral and <b>unilateral</b> transtibial <b>amputations</b> during a 100 -m sprint. We hypothesized that the WA and CC groups would perform similarly in the 100 -m sprint, but the AS group would not.|$|R
40|$|Background There is a disconcerting rate of {{bilateral}} limb loss {{in patients with}} diabetes. Therefore, this study aimed to explore plantar loading of the surviving foot following <b>unilateral</b> trans-tibial <b>amputation</b> within a wider context of daily walking activity to investigate the precise risk to the surviving limb. Methods Twenty-one subjects with diabetic neuropathy and trans-tibial amputation were matched for weight; height; age and gender with 21 control subjects with diabetic neuropathy without history of plantar ulceration. Gait parameters, in-shoe plantar pressure distribution and daily walking (using the step activity monitor) were recorded. Student’s t-tests were used to compare groups (α-level: 0. 05). Findings The trans-tibial amputations group walked almost 30...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} dynamic {{stability}} during running, {{focusing on the}} effects of speed and the use of a leg prosthesis. We compute and compare the maximal Lyapunov exponents of kinematic time-series data from subjects with and without <b>unilateral</b> transtibial <b>amputations</b> running at a wide range of speeds. We find that the dynamics of the affected leg with the running-specific prosthesis are less stable than the dynamics of the unaffected leg, and also less stable than the biological legs of the non-amputee runners. Sur-prisingly, we find that the center-of-mass dynamics of runners with two intact biological legs are slightly less stable than those of runners with amputations. 1 a...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Amputations cause functional, {{musculoskeletal}} {{and cardiovascular}} alterations and, the more proximal the amputation, {{the larger the}} alterations. Objectives To observe the effect of using lower limb prosthetics and that of gait speed on heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), oxygen consumption (VO 2) and energy cost (EC) during gait in traumatic lower limbs amputees. Materials and methods The sample was composed of 30 men with <b>unilateral</b> <b>amputations,</b> 10 transfemoral and 10 transtibial, compared to 10 people with no amputations. All of them selected a pleasant walking speed (PWS) on the treadmill, and two other speeds were calculated, 20 % above and 20 % below the original one. The subjects walked for 10 minutes {{at each of the}} speeds and, in the last three minutes, the VO 2, HR, and BP were assessed. In order to compare variables between groups the variance was performed (ANOVA) followed by the Post Hoc Sheff&# 233; test (p < 0. 05). Results The amputees selected lower values of PWS and had higher HR, BP, and EC, VO 2 during gait when compared to normal individuals. The transfemoral amputees had higher VO 2 and EC compared to the transtibial ones. By analyzing the speed effect, it was observed that, although the VO 2 did not increase with the increased speed, there was increased cardiovascular response and reduced EC. Conclusions Traumatic lower limb amputees have higher energy expenditure and cardiovascular responses during gait and, at higher speeds, they become more economical, reducing the EC...|$|R
