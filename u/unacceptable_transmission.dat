40|$|Abstract — An ad-hoc {{network is}} formed {{by a group}} of mobile hosts upon a {{wireless}} network interface. Previous research in communication in ad-hoc networks has concentrated on routing algorithms which are designed for fully connected networks. The traditional approach to communication in a disconnected ad-hoc network is to let the mobile computer wait for network reconnection passively. This method may lead to <b>unacceptable</b> <b>transmission</b> delays. We propose an approach that guarantees message transmission in minimal time. In this approach, mobile hosts actively modify their trajectories to transmit messages. We develop algorithms that minimize the trajectory modifications under two different assumptions: (a) the movements of all the nodes in the system are known and (b) the movements of the hosts in the system are not known.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Many {{issues are}} {{involved}} in the successful conduct of an Advanced Distributed Simulation (ADS) exercise undertaken over a large geographic area. One key issue {{is the extent to which}} the geographic separation between the simulation nodes creates <b>unacceptable</b> latencies between <b>transmission</b> and reception of data. Latency problems can lead to lack of fidelity in the simulated exercise which ideally requires real time response. This paper reports experiments which estimate these transmission latencies over large geographic areas. The effect of the protocol used (eg. Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) or Higher Level Architecture (HLA)) on the latency is also discussed. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{dramatic}} {{scaling of}} the integrated circuit technology leads to significant challenges for Cu interconnects. The increasing Cu resistivity {{due to the}} size effect causes the <b>unacceptable</b> signal <b>transmission</b> delay. The increasing current density further aggravates the electromigration (EM) of the Cu interconnect. Carbon nanotube (CNT) is considered an alternative material to Cu interconnect, in terms of bottom-up growth process, high electrical and thermal conductivity and high EM resistance. Using a PECVD system, we studied the effects of catalyst thickness, barrier layer, gas composition and built-in electric-field in plasma to control the location, diameter, density, structure, composition and orientation of the CNTs. We demonstrated a low temperature transfer of the vertically aligned CNT film using liftoff technique to avoid the high temperature during the CNT growth process. We fabricated Cu/CNT composite by combining CNT growth and Cu electroplating to solve some engineering problems of the CNT fabrication. We demonstrated the integration of CNT as the contact plug to the silicon MOSFET. The silicide-rooted and open-ended CNT contact plug exhibited better electrical conductivity and thermal stability than the conventional W contact plug. We also demonstrated Cu/CNT composite for via filling to connect two metal layers, exhibiting comparable resistivity to Cu via. We studied the current carrying capacity and the electrical breakdown of the CNT. We investigated the EM properties of Cu/CNT composite via using Kelvin structure, exhibiting much longer EM lifetime than Cu via only. We also studied the EM properties of Cu/CNT composite using the conventional Blech structure. The results suggest that Cu/CNT composite is a potentially good candidate for advanced interconnect applications where high current density and good EM resistance are required...|$|R
40|$|The Active Control of Structural Response (ACSR) {{vibration}} suppression system, where {{hydraulic actuators}} located between the gearbox and the fuselage {{are used to}} cancel vibration in large helicopters, has been used successfully for many years. However the power consumed by the actuators can be high, and using hydraulic actuation for smaller rotorcraft {{has not been seen}} as practical. In contrast to active vibration reduction systems, passive vibration isolation systems require no external power. Passive vibration isolation systems however have the disadvantage of being limited to working at one specific frequency which will not be acceptable as slowed rotor flight becomes more common for fuel efficiency and noise legislation reasons. In this thesis two electrically powered actuation concepts, one piezoelectric, and one electromagnetic were initially evaluated. An electrically powered actively augmented passive, or hybrid, vibration reduction system based on an electro hydrostatic actuator (EHA) concept was proposed to be developed further. This hybrid actuator will have a wider range of operating frequencies than a purely passive system, and have lower power consumption than a purely active system. The design is termed a “Resonant EHA”; in that the resonant frequency of the coupled fluid, pump and electric motor rotor inertia matches the fundamental vibration frequency. The hydraulic cylinder, fluid and pump act as a single stage gear ratio, and the. brushless electric motor’s inertia is the main resonating mass as in a Dynamic Antiresonant Vibration Isolator (DAVI) passive vibration reduction system. The electrical power is used to compensate for friction in the actuator and other losses, and if needed can shift the operating point away from the resonant frequency. Simulation results indicated that a hydraulic circuit in which the pump leakage is fed back into the low pressure line would introduce unacceptable disturbances in the flows to and from the cylinder. To eliminate the source of the disturbances, a fully integrated electric motor and pump circuit design was chosen in which the electric motor is immersed in hydraulic fluid. An EHA demonstrator was built sized for a 1. 5 tonne rotorcraft. For sizing comparison purposes the frameless brushless D. C motor for each strut of 1. 5 tonne rotorcraft has a rotor and stator mass of approximately 1 kg, and can produce a continuous stall torque of 2 Nm. The bidirectional pump has a displacement of 1. 5 cm 3 /rev, the mean system pressure was taken as 90 bar, and the double ended hydraulic cylinder has a 32 mm diameter bore, and 18 mm rod. Initial test results for the proof of concept EHA showed highly significant free play with a reversal of torque direction, resulting in <b>unacceptable</b> loss in <b>transmission</b> stiffness. The free play was traced to the gear pump and a hypothesis for the origin of the free play was put forward. To avoid torque reversals the EHA was further tested with a constant offset torque bias which proved successful in restoring a sufficient stiffness to the transmission. The sizing of the electric motor and power consumed with a non-zero offset torque is greater than a torque reversing motor, which limits the immediate application of the device in the present form. Future research investigating the use of other transmission elements, such as a piston pump, to obtain a more linear stiffness is recommended. As a hybrid vibration isolation system a Root Mean Square (RMS) reduction by a factor of four and near elimination of the fundamental frequency vibrations was achieved for the frequency range of 10 to 20 hertz.
