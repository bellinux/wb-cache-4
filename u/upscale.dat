30|$|<b>Upscaling</b> is {{the process}} of {{reducing}} a large number of the fine-scale grid blocks to a smaller number of coarse-scale grid blocks. This is required because it is often impractical to perform simulation at finest scale of the reservoir. Therefore, <b>upscaling</b> {{is one of the most}} important components of reservoir simulation. The last few decades have seen significant advancements in <b>upscaling</b> which include development of single-phase and multiphase <b>upscaling</b> as well as <b>upscaling</b> in the near wellbore and away from wellbore regions. Single-phase <b>upscaling</b> involves the <b>upscaling</b> of permeability distribution only. The technique is simple and can be used for structurally complex reservoirs but it neglects the multiphase flow effects (Durlofsky 1991; Ringrose 2007). In multiphase flow <b>upscaling,</b> relative permeability curves are also <b>upscaled</b> in addition to absolute permeability <b>upscaling.</b> This approach is computationally expensive and as such its use is limited to simple reservoir models (Ekrann and Dale 1992; Ringrose 2007).|$|R
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{we discuss}} some <b>upscaling</b> methods for flow and transport in heterogeneous reservoirs. We studied realization-based multi-phase flow and transport <b>upscaling</b> and ensemble-level flow <b>upscaling.</b> Multi-phase <b>upscaling</b> is {{more accurate than}} single-phase <b>upscaling</b> and is often required for high level of coarsening. In multi-phase <b>upscaling,</b> the <b>upscaled</b> transport parameters are time-dependent functions and are challenging to compute. Due to the hyperbolic feature of the saturation equation, the nonlocal effects evolve in both space and time. Standard local two-phase <b>upscaling</b> gives significantly biased results with reference to fine-scale solutions. In this work, we proposed two types of multi-phase <b>upscaling</b> methods, TOF (time-offlight) - based two-phase <b>upscaling</b> and local-global two-phase <b>upscaling.</b> These two methods incorporate global flow information into local two-phase <b>upscaling</b> calculations. A linear function of time and time-of-flight and a global coarse-scale two-phase solution (time-dependent) are used respectively in these two approaches. The local boundary condition therefore captures the global flow effects both spatially and temporally. These two methods are applied to permeability distributions with various correlation lengths. Numerical results show that they consistently improve existing two-phase <b>upscaling</b> methods and provide accurate coarse-scale solutions for both flow and transport. We also studied ensemble level flow <b>upscaling.</b> Ensemble level <b>upscaling</b> is up scaling for multiple geological realizations and often required for uncertainty quantification. Solving the flow problem for all the realizations is time-consuming. In recent years, some stochastic procedures are combined with <b>upscaling</b> methods to efficiently compute the <b>upscaled</b> coefficients for a large set of realization. We proposed a fast perturbation approach in the ensemble level <b>upscaling.</b> By Karhunen-Lo`eve expansion (KLE), we proposed a correction scheme to fast compute the <b>upscaled</b> permeability for each realization. Then the sparse grid collocation and adaptive clustering are coupled with the correction scheme. When we solve the local problem, the solution can be represented by a product of Green's function and source term. Using collocation and clusering technique, one can avoid the computation of Green's function for all the realizations. We compute Green's function at the interpolation nodes, then for any realization, the Green's function {{can be obtained by}} interpolation. The above techniques allow us to compute the <b>upscaled</b> permeability rapidly for all realizations in stochastic space...|$|R

40|$|Steady-state <b>upscaling</b> of {{relative}} permeability is studied {{for a range}} of reservoir models. Both rate-dependent <b>upscaling</b> and <b>upscaling</b> in the capillary and viscous limits are considered. In particular, we study fluvial depositional systems, which represent a large and important class of reservoirs. Numerical examples show that steady-state <b>upscaling</b> is rate dependent, in accordance with previous work. In this respect we introduce a scale-dependent capillary number to estimate the balance between viscous and capillary forces. The difference between the limit solutions can be large, and we show that the intermediate flow rates can span several orders of magnitude. This substantiate the need for rate-dependent steady-state <b>upscaling</b> in a range of flow scenarios. We demonstrate that steady-state <b>upscaling</b> converges from the capillary to the viscous limit solution as the flow rate increases, and we identify a simple synthetic model where the convergence fails to be monotone.

30|$|The {{main purpose}} of <b>upscaling</b> in {{reservoir}} simulation is to capture the dynamic behavior of fine scale models at the coarse scale. Traditional static or dynamic methods use assumptions about the boundary conditions to determine the <b>upscaled</b> properties. In this paper, we show that the <b>upscaled</b> properties are strongly dependent on the flow process observed at the fine scale. We use a simple no-crossflow depletion drive process and demonstrate that an <b>upscaled</b> property is not a constant value. Instead, {{if the goal is}} to match the performance of the fine scale model, the <b>upscaled</b> permeability changes with time. We provide an analytical solution to determine the <b>upscaled</b> permeability and present the value of <b>upscaled</b> permeability under limiting conditions. Our equation suggests that it is possible that <b>upscaled</b> value can fall outside the range of fine scale values under certain conditions. We show that for pseudo steady state flow, using common averaging methods like arithmetic or even geometric averaging methods can lead to optimistic results. We also show that the no-crossflow solution is significantly different than crossflow solution at late times. We validate our method by comparing the results of the method with flow simulation results in two and multi-layered models.|$|R

30|$|One {{method of}} <b>upscaling</b> {{involves}} averaging the parameters and imputing the averaged values {{directly into the}} simulation flow grid. Most of the averaging techniques (arithmetic, harmonic, geometric, power law, pressure solver) are only appropriate under the circumstances of perfectly layered or heterogeneous distributions that are perfectly random and seldom observed in realistic reservoir descriptions. Another method of <b>upscaling</b> is an averaging technique that first computes the lower and upper bounds of the effective properties, based on geology, and then uses a new correlation and scaling technique to estimate the effective properties for the <b>upscaled</b> grid (Li et al. 2001). Purely local <b>upscaling</b> methods consider only those fine-scale grids that are combined in the target coarse-scale grid (Durlofsky 1991; King and Mansfield 1999). The hydraulic conductivity <b>upscaling</b> method (Wen and Gómez-Hernández 1996) involves <b>upscaling</b> of hydraulic conductivities at the scale of measurements to a coarser grid of block conductivity tensors. The extended local procedure includes few of the adjacent grids in the local problems (Gómez-Hernández and Journel 1994; Wu et al. 2002). In global <b>upscaling</b> methods, the flow solution utilized to calculate the <b>upscaled</b> parameters is performed over the entire domain (White and Horne 1987; Pickup et al. 1992; Holden and Nielson 2000). This technique can provide high level of accuracy, {{but it has a}} disadvantage of requiring global fine-scale solutions.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} methodology, called {{multi-level}} local-global (MLLG) <b>upscaling,</b> for generating accurate <b>upscaled</b> models of permeabilities or transmissibilities for flow simulation on adapted grids in heterogeneous subsurface formations. The method generates an initial adapted grid {{based on the}} given fine-scale reservoir heterogeneity and potential flow paths. It then applies local-global (LG) <b>upscaling</b> for permeability or transmissibility [7], along with adaptivity, in an iterative manner. In each iteration of MLLG, the grid can be adapted where needed to reduce flow solver and <b>upscaling</b> errors. The adaptivity is controlled with a flow-based indicator. The iterative process is continued until consistency between the global solve on the adapted grid and the local solves is obtained. While each application of local-global <b>upscaling</b> is also an iterative process, this inner iteration generally takes {{only one or two}} iterations to converge. Furthermore, the number of outer iterations is bounded above, and hence the computational costs of this approach are low. We design a new flow-based weighting of transmissibility values in local-global <b>upscaling</b> that significantly improves the accuracy of LG and MLLG over traditional local transmissibility calculations. For highly heterogeneous (e. g., channelized) systems the integration of grid adaptivity and local-global <b>upscaling</b> is shown to consistently provide more accurate coarse-scale models for global flow, relative to reference fine-scale results, than do existing <b>upscaling</b> techniques applied to uniform grids of similar densities. Another attractive property of the integration of <b>upscaling</b> and adaptivity is that process dependency is strongly reduced, that is, the approach computes accurate global flow results also for flows driven by boundary conditions different from the generic boundary conditions used to compute the <b>upscaled</b> parameters. The method is demonstrated on Cartesian Cell-based Anisotropic Refinement (CCAR) grids, but can be applied to other adaptation strategies for structured grids, and extended to unstructured grids. 1.

40|$|The Tubåen Formation in the Norwegian Sea is an aquifer and {{was used}} by Statoil ASA as the {{injection}} reservoir for CO 2 separated from produced gas at Snøhvit in the time period between April 2008 until it was abandoned in April 2011. The CO 2 injection and plume development is currently described with a simulation model using only one set of isotropic, un-scaled flow functions, i. e. {{the potential for a}} more accurate simulation model is great. This thesis investigate how <b>upscaled</b> flow functions affect the dynamic behaviour in the reservoir. Different <b>upscaling</b> techniques are used and compared by looking at how they affect the CO 2 plume development in the formation. All models used in this thesis are the property of Statoil ASA. Lithofacies models with small scale hetereogeneities typical for the Tubåen formation, Wavy and Flaser, are made to fit each of the zones in Tubåen before the flow functions are <b>upscaled</b> in the models using the <b>upscaling</b> techniques Capillary Equilibrium and Viscous Limit. The <b>upscaling</b> is performed by the <b>Upscaling</b> Module in the open source software Open Porous Media. The resulting relative permeability curves clearly show that the small scale heterogeneities and <b>upscaling</b> technique affect the two-phase flow. In the final step the <b>upscaled</b> flow functions are used in various combinations as input in the full scale simulation model of the Tubåen Formation. A set of models with various combinations of <b>upscaled</b> flow functions are made to be able to distinguish between geology effects in the reservoir and relative permeability effects on the CO 2 distribution. All models with <b>upscaled</b> curves are also compared to the Basecase with a single set of isotropic, un-scaled flow functions.
