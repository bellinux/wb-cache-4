5|$|As indicated, hospice is {{frequently}} under-utilized and often not {{taken advantage of}} <b>until</b> <b>very</b> late in a patient's illness. The reasons for this have {{as much to do}} with financial considerations as with the psycho-social difficulty in choosing hospice. A 2009 study found that with proper case management hospice access could be liberalized without additional costs to insurers.|$|E
5|$|Fighter pilots {{received}} no instrument training <b>until</b> <b>very</b> {{late in the}} war, after the training course had already been curtailed because of fuel shortages {{and the need to}} produce pilots more quickly to replace losses. Galland also did not make sure all-weather flying was incorporated into pilot training, which was of decisive importance in an effective air defence force.|$|E
5|$|Lemur {{taxonomy}} {{has changed}} significantly {{since the first}} taxonomic classification of lemurs by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. One {{of the greatest challenges}} has been the classification of the aye-aye, which has been a topic of debate up <b>until</b> <b>very</b> recently. Until Richard Owen published a definitive anatomical study in 1866, early naturalists were uncertain whether the aye-aye (genus Daubentonia) was a primate, rodent, or marsupial. However, the placement of the aye-aye within the order Primates remained problematic <b>until</b> <b>very</b> recently. Based on its anatomy, researchers have found support for classifying the genus Daubentonia as a specialized indriid, a sister group to all strepsirrhines, and as an indeterminate taxon within the order Primates. Molecular tests have now shown Daubentoniidae is basal to all Lemuriformes, and in 2008, Russell Mittermeier, Colin Groves, and others ignored addressing higher-level taxonomy by defining lemurs as monophyletic and containing five living families, including Daubentoniidae.|$|E

5|$|The Nahuatl {{languages}} are agglutinative, polysynthetic languages that make {{extensive use of}} compounding, incorporation and derivation. That is, they can add many different prefixes and suffixes to a root <b>until</b> <b>very</b> long words are formed, and a single word can constitute an entire sentence.|$|E
5|$|Female {{sexuality}} {{is often not}} adequately represented in texts and documents. <b>Until</b> <b>very</b> recently, much {{of what has been}} documented about women's sexuality has been written by men, in the context of male understanding, and relevant to women's associations to men—as their wives, daughters, or mothers, for example. Often artistic representations of female sexuality suggest trends or ideas on broad scales, giving historians clues as to how widespread or accepted erotic relationships between women were.|$|E
5|$|Pattle joined No. 80 Squadron RAF. The {{squadron}} was in {{the midst}} of re-forming at RAF Kenley and he was able to fly the Gloster Gladiator fighter for the first time in May 1937. In June, the unit moved to RAF Debden. Here, they practised aerial combat against RAF Bomber Command squadrons which staged mock raids against London. During these exercises, he mastered deflection shooting. Pattle developed his own air tactics. He preferred attacking at higher altitudes than his quarry, meeting head-on, then waiting for the enemy to fly by before rolling over and diving to attack from the side and rear of the enemy. He usually held his fire <b>until</b> <b>very</b> close to the target to make sure of hitting his opponent. His qualities as an officer led to him being promoted to squadron adjutant. A gifted flyer and natural marksman, he took pains to improve both talents, doing exercises to improve his distance vision and sharpen his reflexes. He progressed in rank with the squadron and was duly promoted to pilot officer on 27 July 1937.|$|E
50|$|As Germany began losing World War II, {{the draft}} {{exemption}} for security forces was slowly lifted, although {{due to the}} nature of the Nazi regime, there was a constant need for security personnel up <b>until</b> the <b>very</b> end in 1945. For this reason, many Gestapo, SD, and Kripo members who served as reservists never saw combat <b>until</b> the <b>very</b> last days of the war, if at all.|$|R

5|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2015 season, three practice sessions were held, two 90-minute sessions on Friday and another one-hour session before qualifying on Saturday. However, all three sessions were disrupted and little running took place. During {{the first session}} on Friday morning, a spillage of diesel on track prevented the cars from going out on <b>until</b> <b>very</b> late in the session. Eventually, Nico Hülkenberg topped the session for Force India, ahead of his compatriots Nico Rosberg and Sebastian Vettel. Since water was used to clear the surface, the first laps were run on intermediate tyres by most drivers, with both Williams cars being equipped with full wet tyres, but Valtteri Bottas spun on them entering the pit lane. Later, the track dried enough to use slick tyres, Fernando Alonso being the first to do so. Due to the limited running, the last minutes were busy with most cars out on track. Marcus Ericsson however was confined to the sidelines as he stopped with an engine problem. As Lewis Hamilton spun on his last timed lap, he needed to settle for seventh fastest.|$|E

25|$|The role {{of women}} in ancient warfare {{differed}} from culture to culture. Warfare throughout written history mainly has been portrayed in modern times as a matter for men, but women also have played a role. <b>Until</b> <b>very</b> recently, little mention of these exploits was included in retellings of history in most countries, aside from the Amazons.|$|E

Another Neafie & Levy vessel that is still operational is the tugboat Jupiter. A third vessel, the tugboat Tuff-E-Nuff (originally the Thomas Cunningham Sr.), built in 1895, was remarkably still in commercial service in its original role as of May 2007.|$|E
25|$|At {{least some}} authors, however, have {{interpreted}} an at least more neutral message. In some versions, the act between Horus and Set was consensual, if improper, and Set's consumption of Horus' seed produced Thoth's lunar disc, thus being somewhat positive in outcome. Likewise, Set was not demonised <b>until</b> <b>very</b> late in Egyptian history, {{and the sexual}} act has been recorded since the first versions.|$|E

25|$|Between 1962 and 1998 Mayagüez {{was a major}} tuna canning and {{processing}} center. At one time, 80% of all tuna products consumed in the United States were packed in Mayagüez (the biggest employer, StarKist, had 11,000 employees working three daily shifts in the local plant's heyday). Mayagüez was also a major textile industry hub; <b>until</b> <b>very</b> recently, {{almost a quarter of}} all drill uniforms used by the United States Army were sewn in the city.|$|E
25|$|Owen Maddock {{had always}} been a prodigious walker and cyclist, despite being asthmatic, and {{remained}} active <b>until</b> <b>very</b> shortly before his death. In later years, following the decline of the British hovercraft industry, employment had become hard to find and so Maddock returned to his love of jazz. He played woodwind instruments for various local groups, and regularly competed on the piano in jazz competitions. Maddock died in Cowes on 19 July 2000.|$|E
25|$|Aidan Dodson {{uses the}} Meryre {{depiction}} to conclude Smenkhkare served only as coregent starting about Year 13 of Akhenaten with the wine docket simply indicating that his estate {{was still in}} operation several years later. Nefertiti becomes his next coregent as King Neferneferuaten (perhaps with abbreviated honors) and succeeds him. The main argument against this <b>until</b> <b>very</b> recently (see below) has been the assumption that Nefertiti died once she disappeared from the record after Year 13.|$|E
