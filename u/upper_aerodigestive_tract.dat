40|$|CONTEXT: Neck {{dissection}} {{that accompanies}} resection {{of the primary}} lesion in malignant tumors of the <b>upper</b> <b>aerodigestive</b> <b>tracts</b> may cause complications inherent to the procedure or to prolongation of surgical time, increasing the risks for the patient. Among the complications that might occur is blindness, a rare complication with only 10 cases {{reported in the literature}} thus far. OBJECTIVE: To present the case of a diabetic patient submitted to total laryngectomy and modified and selective neck dissection that resulted in blindness. CASE REPORT: The authors report on a patient submitted to total laryngectomy and selective neck dissection on the left side, and modified radical neck dissection on the right, who developed blindness. This was probably due to intraoperative hypotension plus the contribution of decompensated diabetes mellitus and thrombosis of the internal jugular vein on the right side.

40|$|The {{squamous}} cell carcinomas of the <b>upper</b> <b>aerodigestive</b> <b>tracts</b> are frequent neoplasia, {{with as much}} as 466, 831 and 168, 368 cases diagnosed in 2008 among men and women worldwide, respectively. As such, they make up the sixth most frequent neoplasia among men and the eighth among women. Their frequency shows interesting variations covering the last 20 years, with an ascending tendency among women, which is higher in Europe, and a descending tendency in men, maximal in the USA. The comparison with the Belgian official data reveals a striking elevation of incidence of these cancers between both sexes, with important regional differences in Belgium. Finally, when we compare Belgian and French data, these cancers seem more frequent in France in men, {{but there is an}} opposite tendency among women, in which the carcinoma of the larynx is most represented in Belgium.

The artificial larynx {{is composed of}} a hollow, porous tube that elongates the trachea and is capped with a valve {{that acts as a}} laryngeal sphincter. Through an industrial collaboration, our team developed a porous biomaterial that can be colonized by cervical tissues. This biomaterial has been used in animals to replace part of the trachea, but it is meant to eventually substitute for laryngeal cartilage. The tracheal prosthesis is a hollow cylindrical tube composed of titanium microbeads. We performed a study in large animals to establish an optimal surgical protocol for tracheal replacement in humans. The study included 11 sheep (n = 11) and compared 5 methods of implantation. We successfully established an optimal three-step surgical protocol to make the porous-titanium tracheal prosthesis functional: (1) large lumen endoprosthetics, (2) colonization by the peripheral tissues, and (3) endoprosthetic epithelialization.

However, it is at present largely unclear to what extent these proteases are expressed in viral target cells in human tissues. Here, we show that both HAT and TMPRSS 2 are coexpressed with 2, 6 -linked sialic acids, the major receptor determinant of human influenza viruses, throughout the human respiratory tract. Similarly, coexpression of ACE 2, the SARS-coronavirus receptor, and TMPRSS 2 was frequently found in the <b>upper</b> and lower <b>aerodigestive</b> <b>tract,</b> with the exception of the vocal folds, epiglottis and trachea. Finally, activation of influenza virus was conserved between human, avian and porcine TMPRSS 2, suggesting that this protease might activate influenza virus in reservoir-, intermediate- and human hosts.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Background: Aspiration {{pneumonia}} {{remains a}} significant and often devastating problem in critically ill patients. It is unclear whether aspiration pneumonia occurs because of problems in the handling of oropharyngeal secre-tions or if the reflux of gastric contents is the major etiolog-ical factor. Additionally, the obvious breakdown of <b>upper</b> <b>aerodigestive</b> protective mechanisms in the critically ill patient population is largely unstudied. Finally, the impact and contribution of tubes, both endotracheal and nasoen-teral, on aspiration pneumonia is unclear. Methods: A Medline literature search on scientific and review articles concerning the normal physiology of the <b>aerodigestive</b> <b>tract</b> and factors that compromised normal physiology was undertaken. Read-ings were supplemented by expert outside opinion from researchers in these fields and from the combined expertise from a multidisciplinary panel of experts assembled at a recent summit on aspiration pneumonia. Results: Changes in the normal physiology of the <b>aerodigestive</b> <b>tract</b> are vast and varied and dependent on the response to injury, iatrogenic interventions, {{and the use of}} nasoenteral and endotracheal tubes. The effects on gastric and esophageal motility are likely dynamic and represent an ongoing but changing risk of reflux for the patient. Nasoenteral and endotracheal tubes likely compromise <b>upper</b> <b>aerodigestive</b> protective mecha-nisms. Conclusions: More research is needed on the function-ing of the aerodigestive protective mechanisms in critically ill patients. Understanding of the dynamic changes in gastro-intestinal motility will also be an important factor to decrease the incidence of aspiration pneumonia in this patient population.

50|$|A {{liposomal}} {{formulation of}} zinc phthalocyanine (CGP55847) has undergone clinical trials (Phase I/II, Switzerland) against squamous cell carcinomas of the <b>upper</b> <b>aerodigestive</b> <b>tract.</b> Phthalocyanines (PCs) {{are related to}} tetra-aza porphyrins. Instead of four bridging carbon atoms at the meso-positions, as for the porphyrins, PCs have four nitrogen atoms linking the pyrrolic sub-units. PCs also have an extended conjugate pathway: a benzene ring is fused to the β-positions {{of each of the}} four-pyrrolic sub-units. These rings strengthen the absorption of the chromophore at longer wavelengths (with respect to porphyrins). The absorption band of PCs is almost two orders of magnitude stronger than the highest Q band of haematoporphyrin. These favourable characteristics, along with the ability to selectively functionalise their peripheral structure, make PCs favourable photosensitiser candidates.|$|E
5000|$|The neck {{dissection}} is {{a surgical}} procedure {{for control of}} neck lymph node metastasis. This can be done for clinically or radiologically evident lymph nodes {{or as part of}} curative surgery where risk of occult nodal metastasis is deemed sufficiently high. The aim of the procedure is to remove lymph nodes from the neck into which cancer cells may have migrated. Metastasis of tumours into the lymph nodes of the neck is one of the strongest prognostic indicators for head and neck cancer. The metastases may originate from tumours of the <b>upper</b> <b>aerodigestive</b> <b>tract,</b> including the oral cavity, tongue, nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx, as well as the thyroid, parotid and posterior scalp. Neck nodal metastasis can sometimes also originate from lung cancer or intra-abdominal malignancy. However, neck dissection is rarely performed for such purposes.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} the possible differential role of refined and whole grain cereals on {{the risk of}} upper digestive and respiratory tract neoplasms. DESIGN: Hospital-based case-control study. SETTING: University Hospital of Lausanne, Switzerland. SUBJECTS: A total of 156 incident cases of cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx, 101 of the oesophagus, 40 of the larynx, and 349 control subjects admitted for {{a wide spectrum of}} acute non-neoplastic conditions. INTERVENTION: Trained interviewers collected information using a structured and validated questionnaire. Odds ratios (OR) of various cancers for a tertile increment of intake of refined and whole grains were estimated using unconditional multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Refined grains were directly related to the risk of cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx (OR= 1. 9 for the highest tertile), oesophagus (OR= 3. 7) and larynx (OR= 4. 0). In contrast, whole grain cereals were protective, with OR of 0. 6 for oral cavity and pharynx, 0. 3 for oesophagus, and 0. 7 for larynx. For the three sites combined, the OR for the highest tertile was 5. 7 for refined grains and 0. 5 for wholegrains. The trends in risk for refined grains were significant for all sites and their combination, and for wholegrain for oesophageal cancer and all sites. CONCLUSIONS: Even if inference on causality and the biological interpretation remain open to discussion, the present data indicate and further quantify that refined cereals are an unfavourable, but whole grain ones a favourable indicator of the risk of <b>upper</b> <b>aerodigestive</b> and respiratory <b>tract</b> neoplasms...|$|R

A clinical case of successful treatment of a patient with locally distributed hypopharynx cancer is provided, regarding which microsurgical reconstruction of upper sections of the <b>aerodigestive</b> <b>tract</b> was performed with a free colonic-ileal autogenic graft at the surgical stage of therapy after laryngectomy with sleeve resection of the hypopharynx. The use of a colonic-ileal autogenic graft in the course of reconstruction of upper sections of the <b>aerodigestive</b> <b>tract</b> allowed instant recovery of both food passage and voice function for the patient after laryngectomy with sleeve resection of the hypopharynx. Conclusions: 1. Application of this autogenic graft as a plastic material allows recovering both food passage and voice function instantly and completely with circular defects of upper sections of the <b>aerodigestive</b> <b>tract.</b> 2. The ileocecal valve included into the structure of the combined autogenic graft prevents saliva and food aspiration into the trachea through the tracheo-oesophageal shunt. 3. Mucous secretion of the autogenic graft has no aggressive action on the mucous membrane of the trachea, which allows implementation of the vocal rehabilitation plan. 4.
