25|$|Bhumibol had the {{constitutional}} prerogative to pardon criminals, {{although there are}} several criteria for receiving a pardon, including age and remaining sentence. The 2006 pardoning of several convicted child rapists, including an Australian rapist and child pornographer, caused controversy. However, under the Thai constitution, the king has the prerogative to grant pardons and all laws, royal rescripts, and royal commands relating to state affairs must be countersigned by a minister <b>unless</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>provided</b> for in the constitution.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} several extrajudicial {{administrative}} courts. The Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings adjudicates matters for all city agencies <b>unless</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>provided</b> for by executive order, rule, law or pursuant to collective bargaining agreements. The Department of Finance Adjudication Division (Parking Violations Bureau) adjudicates parking violations, and the Tax Appeals Tribunal adjudicates disputes regarding city-administered taxes other than real estate assessment claims, which are adjudicated {{by the city}} Tax Commission. The state DMV Traffic Violations Bureau adjudicates non-parking traffic violations.|$|E
25|$|The {{governor}} {{has the power}} to commission officers not otherwise commissioned by the law of Oklahoma and has the power of appointment. When any office at the state level becomes vacant for any reason, the governor, <b>unless</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>provided</b> by law, {{has the power to}} appoint a person to fill such vacancy, who shall continue in office until the election or appointment of a successor. If the office of an Oklahoma member of the United States House of Representatives or United States Senate becomes vacant the governor calls a special election to fill the remainder of the term. In the case of United States senators, the governor is empowered by the U.S. Constitution to appoint someone immediately to fill the vacant Senate seat temporarily until a special election can be held.|$|E

25|$|When hearing an appeal, the Court of Appeal {{normally}} {{sits with}} a bench of three Judges of Appeal, {{one of whom}} is the Chief Justice. If necessary though, such as in cases of unusual difficulty or importance, the bench may comprise five or any greater uneven number of judges. Certain appeals, including those against interlocutory orders, may be heard by only two judges. Matters before the Court are decided according to the opinion {{of the majority of the}} members of the Court hearing the case. If there are only two judges hearing an appeal and they disagree, the appeal is dismissed and the decision appealed against stands. Proceedings in the High Court are heard before a single judge, <b>unless</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>provided</b> by any written law. A Judge of Appeal may also sit in the High Court as a Judge.|$|E
25|$|<b>Unless</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>provided</b> by the act {{or by the}} contract, the {{compensation}} shall {{be limited to the}} injury actually suffered and the interests which have been lost. Interests which could have been normally expected are deemed to be the interests which have been lost, according to the ordinary course of things, the decided projects, equipment, or other particular circumstances. A person who has wrongfully caused the death of another shall also be bound to make compensation for the injury to any person incurring the medical expenses, increasing the need in living, or incurring the funeral expenses. If the deceased was statutorily bound to furnish maintenance to a third party, the tortfeasor shall also make compensation to such third party for any injury arising therefrom. In case of death caused by a wrongful act, the father, mother, sons, daughters and spouse of the deceased may claim for a reasonable compensation in money even if such injury is not a purely pecuniary loss.|$|E
25|$|The debtor {{shall be}} {{responsible}} for his acts, whether intentional or negligent. The extent of responsibility for one's negligence varies with the particular nature of the affair; but such responsibility shall be lessened, if the affair {{is not intended to}} procure interests to the debtor. If there is change of circumstances which is not predictable then after the constitution of the contract, and if the performance of the original obligation arising therefrom will become obviously unfair, the party may apply to the court for increasing or reducing his payment, or altering the original obligation. If according {{to the nature of the}} contract or the expression of intent of the parties, the purpose of the contract can not be accomplished if not performed within the fixed period, and if one of the parties does not perform the contract within that period, the other party may rescind the contract without giving the notice specified in the preceding article. <b>Unless</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>provided</b> by the act or by the contract, a person who is bound to make compensation for an injury shall restore the injured party to the status quo before the injury. If the restoration of the status quo ante shall be paid in money, interest shall be added from the time of the injury.|$|E

[...] Section 5 further states that beginning July 1, 1997, all existing, new, or increased assessments must comply with Article XIII D. [...] However, Section 5 specifies that four classes of assessments existing on the effective date of Article XIII D (November 6, 1996) are exempt from the procedures and approval process contained in that article. [...] The California Legislature enacted a statute that broadly defined the phrase [...] "procedures and approval process" [...] for purposes of the existing assessment exemptions under Proposition 218.|$|E
2500|$|The Twentieth Amendment (1933) {{changes the}} date on which a new President, Vice President and Congress take office, thus {{shortening}} the time between Election Day {{and the beginning of}} Presidential, Vice Presidential and Congressional terms. Originally, the Constitution provided that the annual meeting was to be on the first Monday in December <b>unless</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>provided</b> by law. [...] This meant that, when a new Congress was elected in November, it did not come into office until the following March, with a [...] "lame duck" [...] Congress convening in the interim. [...] By moving the beginning of the president's new term from March 4 to January 20 (and in the case of Congress, to January 3), proponents hoped {{to put an end to}} lame duck sessions, while allowing for a speedier transition for the new administration and legislators.|$|E

However, if a contract includes Alternate IV of the clause, the Contracting Officer's approval is not required to assert claim to copyright. Whenever the contractor asserts claim to copyright in works other than computer software, the government, and others acting on its behalf, are granted a license to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute, perform and display the copyrighted work.
