40|$|Camellia oil is an edible {{vegetable}} oil with high value of nutrition and health protection function such as antioxidant and adjusting blood fat. In this study, a simple, rapid and effective HPTLC method {{was developed for}} analyzing the composition and antioxidant constituents of camellia oil. The HPTLC was performed on G 60 plate with n-hexane-diethyl ether-acetic acid (6 : 4 : 0. 1, v/v/v) as mobile phase combined with two coloration methods (ethanol containing 10 % phosphomolybdic acid, ethanol containing 0. 03 % DPPH) and scanning densitometry technique. The <b>unsaturated</b> fatty <b>glyceride,</b> free fatty acids, sterols and lipids including triolein, oleic acid, ergosterin, β -sitosterol, tocopherol and phospholipids in camellia oils were determined and performed densitometrically at λ s 1 = 620 nm and λ s 2 = 517 nm. The {{results show that the}} main components of different samples of camellia oil are similar, however the contents are diverse. The antioxidative test shows that camellia oil has obvious antioxidant capability as olive oil, especially the pressed virgin oil. Therefore, this non-derivatization HPTLC method can be used for composition and antioxidative capacity determination of camellia oils...|$|R
40|$|To {{avoid the}} {{systemic}} adverse effects that might occur after oral administration, transdermal delivery of ambroxol was studied {{as a method}} for maintaining proper blood levels for an extended period. Release of ambroxol according to concentration and temperature was determined, and permeation of drug through rat skin was studied using two chamber-diffusion cells. The solubility according to PEG 400 volume fraction was highest at 40 % PEG 400. The rate of drug release from the EVA matrix increased with increased temperature and drug loading doses. A linear relationship existed between the release rate and the square root of loading rate. The activation energy (Ea) was measured from {{the slope of the}} plot of log P versus 1000 /T and was found to be 10. 71, 10. 39, 10. 33 and 9. 87 kcal/mol for 2, 3, 4 and 5 % loading dose from the EVA matrix, respectively. To increase the permeation rate of ambroxol across rat skin from the EVA matrix, various penetration enhancers such as fatty acids (saturated, <b>unsaturated),</b> propylene glycols, <b>glycerides,</b> pyrrolidones, and non-ionic surfactants were used. The enhancing effects of the incorporated enhancers on the skin permeation of ambroxol were evaluated using Franz diffusion cells fitted with intact excised rat skin at 37 ° using 40 % PEG 400 solution as a receptor medium. Among the enhancers used, polyoxyethylene- 2 -oleyl ether increased the permeation rate by 4. 25 -fold. In conclusion, EVA matrix containing plasticizer and permeation enhancer could be developed for enhanced transdermal delivery of ambroxol...|$|R
