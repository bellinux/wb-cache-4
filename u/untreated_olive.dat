30|$|OMW {{contain an}} {{enormous}} supply {{of organic matter}} very rich in phenolic compounds, which are toxic. <b>Untreated</b> <b>olive</b> mill wastewater (UOMW) is an acidic effluent with a high nutrient content {{that can be used}} to fertilize the soil. However, UOMW had an elevated chemical oxygen demand and a high phenolic content, which have toxic properties. UOMW totally inhibited V. fischeri. This toxicity was essentially due to its high content of phenolics compounds. Its C/N ratio was unfavourable for the biodegradation and humification processes (Mekki et al. 2006 b).|$|E
30|$|The DNA {{damage in}} the treated cells was {{quantified}} as the tail moment (the DNA product in tail X the migration distance in the tail) was compared with <b>untreated</b> cells (<b>Olive,</b> Banath, & Durand, 1990).|$|R
25|$|Sicilian or Greek type (olives with fermentation): Applied to green, semiripe and ripe olives, {{they are}} almost {{identical}} to the Spanish type fermentation process, but the lye treatment process is skipped and the olives are placed directly in fermentation vessels full of brine (8–12% NaCl). The brine is changed {{on a regular basis}} to help remove the phenolic compounds. As the caustic treatment is avoided, lactic acid bacteria are only present in similar numbers to yeast and appear to be outcompeted by the abundant yeasts found on <b>untreated</b> <b>olives.</b> As very little acid is produced by the yeast fermentation, lactic, acetic, or citric acid is often added to the fermentation stage to stabilize the process.|$|R
5000|$|Among {{the recent}} {{preventive}} measures acquired, {{together with the}} idea of pest management and integrated pest management, the treatment with copper-based pesticides has also been cited. Copper, although a pesticide, was found to exert a repellent effect against flies; the females turn their attention instead to oviposition on <b>untreated</b> <b>olives.</b> The basis for this action would be the advance biocidal effect of copper against the symbiotic bacteria, interfering with the physiology of the digestive system of the larvae. These bacteria, which appear on the surface of plants and other materials, infest adult females and transmit them to their offspring through the egg. This bacterial population would have a preferential attraction against flies, which can explain the repellent action. [...] Repellent action would take place by kaolin, also altering the perception of the olive colour of ripening by females. Overall, these measures should not be interpreted as solution methods, including {{on the basis of the}} information on the cases, as it is still limited. Nevertheless, they are interesting because they are compatible with biological control and integrated pest management, which, therefore may play a priceless role in a strategy for integrated pest management.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{effects of}} {{untreated}} and treated olive mill wastewater on seed germination, plant growth and soil fertility were studied. Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum), chickpea (Cicer arietinum), bean (Vicia faba), wheat (Triticum durum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) were {{tested for the}} germination index and growth in soil irrigated by olive mill wastewater. Lepidium sativum {{was used as the}} standard species for the germination index and phytotoxicity evaluation. We measured soil properties, crop growth, herbage biomass, leaf elongation and productivity. The results show beneficial effects using treated olive mill wastewater. The treated plants showed an improvement in seed biomass, spike number, plant growth, and a similar or even better dry productivity than plants irrigated with water, e. g. Hordeum vulgare 102 %, Triticum durum 105 %, Cicer arietinum 101 % and Vicia faba 102 %. An increase in the germination index from 100 % to 115 % was observed. Soil organic matter, respiration and enzymatic activities were also enhanced by treated olive mill wastewater ferti-irrigation. However, even diluted 10 times, <b>untreated</b> <b>olive</b> mill wastewater inhibited the species germination, e. g. 1. 2 % for Hordeum vulgare and 40 % for Cicer arietinum and Vicia faba, and plant growth (16 - 42. 5 %).

When assayed at the concentrations found in brines, only the single phenolic fraction containing hydroxytyrosol strongly inhibited Lact. plantarum. However, inhibition of Lact. plantarum was also observed when double phenolic fractions (e. g. the glucosides, oleuropein and verbascoside) were used; this showed a combined effect in the inhibition. The different permeability of fruit for polyphenols and organic compounds is discussed as the primary cause of the rapid fermentation of alkaline-treated, but not of untreated, olives.

40|$|International audienceA two-year {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to {{study the effects of}} applying <b>untreated</b> <b>Olive</b> Wastewater (OWW), treated OWW and olive pomace compost as soil amendments on both rye-grass growth and soil characteristics. We analysed growth parameters (Leaf Area Index, and fresh and dry weight), leaf green colour (SPAD readings), N uptake of the rye-grass and chemical soil characteristics. The results indicate that the highest untreated OWW application increased growth parameters by 18. 2 % in 2001 and by 41. 1 % in 2002, indicating the possible use of OWW as an amendment to rye-grass. We observed a significant increase in total, extracted and humified organic carbon, and humification parameters. No accumulations of heavy metals in the soil were observed. Furthermore, the N content in OWW was used by the rye-grass for plant growth that increases N uptake, and consequently, dry matter accumulation...|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} yeasts were {{traditionally}} {{regarded as the}} spoiling microorganisms for table olives; however, their role and impact for product quality and for the correct course of fermentation has been revised and nowadays many authors suggest a controlled inoculum of yeasts both in alkali-treated and <b>untreated</b> <b>olives.</b> The selection of a starter is a complex process, involving different steps. After strain isolation from raw material, {{the first step is}} the identification through phenotyping and genotypic methods; then, isolates should be characterized to assess their GRAS (generally recognized as safe) status and technological properties (growth with salt added, at various temperatures and pHs, pectolytic and xylanolytic activity, lipolytic activity, resistance to some preservatives, functional impact). After studying these properties, the results can be submitted to data analysis (many times a statistical multivariate approach) and strain selection. The number of strains to be selected depends on several factors, above all on the main goal: obtaining a single or a multiple-strain starter. After this step, starter should be used for a pilot fermentation on a lab scale, highlighting its performances, limits and benefits, as well as all the issues related to its production, storage and stability throughout the time. Finally, starter optimization conducted on a lab scale should be verified on real conditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{fluidized}} bed gasification of untreated and pre-treated olive residue and pre-treated olive residue mixed with reed, pine pellets and Douglas fir wood chips is studied. Leaching {{is used as}} a pre-treatment process targeted on the elimination of alkali metals such as K and Na as well as chlorine to reduce/eliminate the ash-related problems during gasification. The leaching pre-treatment process could affect the producer gas composition toward the lower or higher yield of CO and H 2 of the producer gas depending on the moisture content of parent fuels. The lower total tar yield of the producer gas in the case of leached olive residue was observed compared to <b>untreated</b> <b>olive</b> residue. At the same time, there are present wider varieties of different tar components in the producer gas of the leached olive residue compared to the untreated one. The distinctions in tar composition and content between the leached and <b>untreated</b> <b>olive</b> residue are attributed to the alkali and alkali earth metal and chorine chemistry affected by leaching pre-treatment. The addition of woody fuels and reed at elevated proportions resulted in the lower LHV value compared to the leached olive residue. The tar content of the producer gas is seen to increase adding reed and woody fuels to the leached olive residue, i. e. the producer gas contained additional variety of tar components whereas phenol becomes one of the key components determining the total tar content, apart from benzene, toluene and naphthalene. This is seen to be due to the higher cellulose, hemicelluloses, lignin as well as higher chlorine content of the reed and woody fuels compared to the leached olive residue. The olive residue is seen to be better fuel for gasification compared with woody fuels and reed. Even more, we believe that the leached olive residue is better compared to all other tested fuel/mixtures in this study. It is seen that the proportions of different fuels in the mixture play role in the composition of the producer gas. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
30|$|Hazard {{assessments}} of toxicity were conducted for UOMW, <b>untreated</b> <b>olive</b> mill wastewater organic extract (UOE), TOMW, treated olive mill wastewater organic extract (TOE) and extracts of soils amended with UOMW (SUOMW) and with TOMW (STOMW). Measures of toxicity were {{achieved by the}} determination of the bioluminescence inhibition (BI (%)) of Vibrio fischeri and by the growth inhibition (GI) of Bacillus megaterium, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Escherichia coli. A BI of V. fischeri of 100 %, 100 %, 65 %, 47 %, 46 % and 30 % were obtained with UOMW, UOE, TOMW, TOE, SUOMW and STOMW respectively. Indeed, even diluted 24 times, a significant BI of 96 % was obtained by UOMW. However, only 30 % BI was obtained by 24 times diluted TOMW. Whereas, 24 times diluted, SUOMW and STOMW did not show a significant BI. The GI of B. megaterium, P. fluorescens and E. coli were, respectively, 93 %, 72 % and 100 % by UOMW; 100 %, 80 % and 100 % by UOE; 70 %, 60 % and 89 % by TOMW; 63 %, 54 % and 68 % by TOE; 39 %, 27 % and 43 % by SUOMW and 23 %, 0 % and 34 % by STOMW.

It was shown that the solution initial pH value affected the metal adsorption capacity and behavior. However, over the pH range of 3. 0 – 5. 0, pH-related effects were not significant. Meanwhile, at lower pH values the uptake capacity decreased. It {{was found that the}} qmax values are (0. 54, 0. 59 and 0. 63), (0. 46, 0. 63, and 0. 69) and (0. 31, 0. 42, and 0. 47) meq/g for Pb 2 + Cu 2 + and Ni 2 + at 298, 308, and 328 K; respectively. The uptake capacity order is: Pb 2 + > Cu 2 + > Ni 2 +. It was also concluded that the R–P and Langmuir models clearly described the metals adsorption onto OMSR more than that of Freundlich and D–R models. The thermodynamics constants ΔH 0, ΔS 0 and ΔG 0 of the adsorption process showed that the adsorption of Pb 2 + and Cu 2 + was endothermic and spontaneous in nature and an opposite finding was observed for Ni 2 + ions. In conclusion, the mode of interaction between Pb 2 +, Cu 2 + and Ni 2 + ions and OMSR was investigated by comparing the changes in the position and intensity of the surface functional groups using FTIR technique.

Among multitude of insect pests fruit flies have gained immense importance not only because of fruit yield losses upto 10 percent but also affecting the trade drastically. Thus it has become essential to produce pest and pesticide free fruits for export. Therefore, research on some promising pest control plant materials was undertaken. Among solvent extracts of 9 promising indigenous plant materials, ethanol extract of harmal' Peganum harmala was the most effective showing 59. 38 percent repellency against Peach fruit fly Bactrocera zonata. It also suppressed and deterred oviposition directly affecting further development. The extract was chemically fractionated into 7 fractions using acetone:petroleum ether (5 : 1) in a glass column 56 cm long; 2. 5 cm internal diameter, packed with silica gel GE 0049. Fractions I, IV and VII having Rf value of 0. 94, 0. 57 and 0. 01, respectively, were promising repellents showing 29. 78, 25. 83 and 24. 10 percent repellency. Oviposition deterrency was 33. 92, 37. 15 and 33. 04 in fraction II, N and VII, respectively. In case of Olive fruit fly Bactrocera oleae the extract at 2 percent concentration repelled 90. 24 percent flies from treated olives in group fly method. In single fly method, the flies spent 99. 1 percent of foraging time on <b>untreated</b> <b>olives</b> in a free choice test. Time per fruit visit was 1. 3 second on treated as compared with 356. 2 seconds on the <b>untreated</b> <b>olives.</b> However, ethanol extract of P. harmala had no effect on parasitism of pupal parasitoid of B. zonata Dirhinus gifardii and larval-pupal parasitoid of B. oleae, Psyttalia concolor in choice and no-choice tests. Application of 1000, 750, 500 and 250 ppm in soil had no effect on pupation inhibition, however, early pupation was recorded in petroleum ether and ethanol extract of P. harmala in B. zonata. Fruit flies fed during pre-oviposition period on diet treated with 2000 ppm of ethanol extract of P. harmala had no effect on oviposition but egg hatching was significantly affected. In another study larval and pupal mortality was significantly higher in the eggs laid from day 21 to 26 in case of B. zonata. In B. oleae, 14 days feeding before mating showed 26. 27 percent damaged eggs. Its SDS-PAGE analysis showed 2 proteins of 19 and 190 kDa missing in deformed eggs providing enough evidence of abnormal eggs in the lot. Further to this number of mature eggs load were lower in F 1 generation of B. oleae flies fed on diet mixed with ethanol extract of P. harmala as compared to the flies fed on untreated diet. This might be due to genotoxic effect of some unknown compounds in P. harmala Biochemical studies showed less carbohydrate contents in flies feeding on extract as compared to normal flies while higher lipids and protein contents in treated flies than untreated flies. This probably due to interference of compounds with endocrinological system of flies.

40|$|In this study, olive pomace, an {{agricultural}} waste {{that is very}} abundant in Mediterranean area, was modified by two chemical treatments {{in order to improve}} its biosorption capacity. Potentiometric titrations and IR analyses were used to characterise <b>untreated</b> <b>olive</b> pomace (OP), olive pomace treated by phosphoric acid (PAOP) and treated by hydrogen peroxide (HPOP). Acid-base properties of all investigated biosorbents were characterised by two main kinds of active sites, whose nature and concentration were determined by a mechanistic model assuming continuous distribution for the proton affinity constants. Titration modelling denoted that all investigated biosorbents (OP, PAOP and HPOP) were characterised by the same kinds of active sites (carboxylic and phenolic), but with different total concentrations with PAOP richer than OP and HPOP. Single metal equilibrium studies in batch reactors were carried out to determine the capacity of these sorbents for copper and cadmium ions at constant pH. Experimental data were analysed and compared using the Langmuir isotherm. The order of maximum uptake capacity of copper and cadmium ions on different biosorbents was PAOP > HPOP > OP. The maximum adsorption capacity of copper and cadmium, was obtained as 0. 48 and 0. 10 mmol/g, respectively, for PAOP. Metal biosorption tests in presence of Na+ in solution were also carried out in order to evaluate the effect of chemical treatment on biomass selectivity. These data showed that PAOP is more selective for cadmium than the other sorbents, while similar selectivity was observed for copper. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{illustrate}} {{the use of}} two different methodologies to investigate the presence of pesticide metabolites in parent pesticide-positive food samples, using ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography coupled to hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight (UHPLC–QTOF) mass spectrometry. First, a common fragmentation pathway between the parent pesticide and its metabolites has been considered to search for metabolites in two positive market samples (imazalil in lemon, chlorpyrifos in grape). Secondly, olive oil samples from field residue trials were used for automated application of comparative software (MetaboLynx), which was used with treated and untreated samples to search for expected and unexpected metabolites of phosmet. One of the main objectives when using these approaches was to avoid the tedious manual searching for potential metabolites within the huge amount of information contained in the total ion chromatogram acquired by TOF MS. The common fragmentation approach applied to TOF MS full-acquisition data, considering an enhanced fragmentation in the collision cell, has allowed the discovery of two metabolites of imazalil (1 -[2 -(2, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 2 -hydroxyethyl]- 1 H-imidazole and 1 -[2 -(2, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 2 -oxoethyl]- 1 H-imidazole) in a lemon positive sample, as well as another two metabolites of chlorpyrifos (chlorpyrifos-oxon and 3, 5, 6 -trichloro- 2 -pyridinol) in a grape positive sample. Moreover, MetaboLynx application to TOF MS data, without promoting fragmentation, from treated and <b>untreated</b> <b>olive</b> oil samples has been helpful in detecting the metabolite phosmet-oxon. In both strategies, every metabolite detected by TOF MS was confirmed using QTOF and/or triple quadrupole instruments.

40|$|Olive mill wastewaters (OMW) {{constitute}} a major environmental problem {{especially for the}} Mediterranean countries, which {{are responsible for the}} largest part of the olive oil produced worldwide. On the other hand, many researchers have established the high fertilizing value of these wastes when they are applied to the soil: OMW are known to increase the soil organic matter content and the concentration of inorganic elements essential for plant growth. Nevertheless, OMW are also known to be highly phytotoxic, which {{has proven to be a}} strong limitation to their application to cultivated soils. Untreated wastewater can be applied to fallow soils or to soils that will only be cultivated after a period of time during which the phytotoxic substances will have been degradated. A solution to the problem of the direct application of the wastewater to the cultivated land is its biological treatment / bioremediation. Such an approach is the aerobic bioremediation of the olive mill wastewater with the nitrogen-fixing bacterium Azotobacter vinelandii. The use of organic amendments as a method for the biological control of soilborne plant pathogenic fungi has been reported by many researchers. In the context of this thesis, the effect of the addition to the soil of <b>untreated</b> <b>olive</b> mill wastewater and bioremediated olive mill wastewater on the suppressiveness against the plant pathogen Rhizoctonia solani was investigated. Several biological parameters have been investigated for the interpretation of the suppressive effects that have been observed. When the soil treated with OMW was infected with Rhizoctonia solani after a certain period of time from the last OMW application, the infection of lettuce seedlings was limited compared to the control (soil treated with water). Suppressiveness was also observed when the soil was infected with the pathogen during the period of the wastewater additions, but to a lesser degree. The effect of a low and a high dose of OMW addition was also examined and a higher suppressiveness was observed in soil treated with the high dose of the wastewater. The use of bioremediated OMW did not reveal any significant suppressive effect against R. solani, neither when the soil was infected with the pathogen during the waste addition nor after a period of time from the last addition of the wastewater nor when a high dose of wastewater was used. The effect of the OMW to the pathogen growth was investigated. It was observed that the wastewater did not prevent the fungus growth; on the contrary it slightly promoted it. It is known that R. solani is a saprophytic fungus able to grow on organic residues. The fungus is also equipped with a specific enzymatic system (lacasses) that is related to the oxidation of phenolic compounds and lignin. ...|$|E
