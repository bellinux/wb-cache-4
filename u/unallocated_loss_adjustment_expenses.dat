40|$|The <b>unallocated</b> <b>loss</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>expense</b> (ULAE) reserve has {{traditionally}} been estimated by the paid-to-paid method (PTP), which compares paid calendar year claims department expenses to paid calendar year losses and then applies the resulting ratio to claims reserves. More recently, Wendy A. Johnson proposed a method that compares paid calendar year claims department expenses to a weighted average of claim counts, and applies this ratio {{to the number of}} claims still to be settled. This paper will explore the shortcomings of these two methods, and will offer two alternative methods which attempt to address some of these shortcomings. The first alternative method uses expected paid loss in place of actual paid loss as the projection base in the PTP method. The second is claim count based like the Johnson method, but reflects the changes in average ULAE costs per claim per calendar year, as the portfolio of claims is run off. The second method does so by projecting future calendar year claim staff levels and average ULAE per claim staff member.

Writers of {{physicians}} professional liability (PPL) claims-made coverage typically offer a death, disability and retirement (DDR) provision within their policy language, stating that, {{in the event}} of one of these three described events, an extended reporting endorsement (ERE) will be provided to the insured without additional premium charge. The current methodology for deriving an indicated DDR reserve is time-consuming, leveraged, and uncertain {{as a result of its}} reliance on calendar period projections up to 50 years beyond the evaluation date. This monograph proposes a fundamentally different methodology for developing an indicated DDR reserve that addresses these concerns. A related methodology for pricing the DDR policy provision will also be presented. In addition, two methodologies that may be used to develop an indicated <b>loss</b> and <b>loss</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>expense</b> (LAE) reserve associated with issued EREs are presented...|$|R

40|$|There are {{a number}} of methodological issues {{involved}} in assessing damage caused by natural hazards. The first is the lack of data, due to the rarity of events and the widely different circumstances in which they occur. Thus, historical data, albeit scarce, should not be neglected when seeking to build ex-ante risk management models. This article analyses the input of insurance data for two recent severe coastal storm events, to examine what causal relationships may exist between hazard characteristics and the level of damage incurred by residential buildings. To do so, data was collected at two levels: from lists of about 4000 damage records, 358 <b>loss</b> <b>adjustment</b> reports were consulted, constituting a detailed damage database. The results show that for flooded residential buildings, over 75 % of reconstruction costs are associated with interior elements, with damage to structural components remaining very localised and negligible. Further analysis revealed a high scatter between costs and water depth, suggesting that uncertainty remains high in drawing up damage functions with insurance data alone. Due to the paper format of the <b>loss</b> <b>adjustment</b> reports, and the lack of harmonisation between their contents, the collection stage called for a considerable amount of work. For future events, establishing a standardised process for archiving damage information could significantly contribute to the production of such empirical damage functions. Nevertheless, complementary sources of data on hazards and asset vulnerability parameters will definitely still be necessary for damage modelling; multivariate approaches, crossing insurance data with external material, should also be investigated more deeply...|$|R
