5|$|Patrick Sinclair, the {{military}} governor at Fort Michilimackinac, organized the British expeditions {{from the north}} in present-day Michigan. Beginning in February 1780, he directed traders to circulate through their territories and recruit interested tribes for an expedition against St. Louis. Sinclair offered the fur traders the opportunity to control the fur trade in the <b>upper</b> <b>parts</b> of Spanish Louisiana as an incentive to participate.|$|E
5|$|The {{black-necked grebe}} (Podiceps nigricollis), known in North America as the eared grebe, {{is a member}} of the grebe family of water birds. It was {{described}} in 1831 by Christian Ludwig Brehm. There are currently three accepted subspecies, including the nominate subspecies. Its breeding plumage features a distinctive ochre-coloured plumage that extends behind its eye and over its ear coverts. The rest of the <b>upper</b> <b>parts,</b> including the head, neck, and breast, are coloured black to blackish brown. The flanks are tawny rufous to maroon-chestnut, and the abdomen is white. When in its non-breeding plumage, this bird has greyish-black <b>upper</b> <b>parts,</b> including the top of the head and a vertical stripe on the back of the neck. The flanks are also greyish-black. The rest of the body is a white or whitish colour. The juvenile has more brown in its darker areas. The subspecies californicus can be distinguished from the nominate by the former's usually longer bill. The other subspecies, P. n. gurneyi, can be differentiated by its greyer head and <b>upper</b> <b>parts</b> and by its smaller size. P. n. gurneyi can also be told apart by its lack of a non-breeding plumage. This species is present in parts of Africa, Eurasia, and the Americas.|$|E

50|$|The gun {{itself is}} {{fixed to the}} <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> of the turret. Elevation of the gun is {{achieved}} by tilting the entire <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> of the turret. Traverse is achieved conventionally, by rotating the turret.|$|R
50|$|ASMO 449 is a 7-bit {{character}} set. Although some encodings allocate this 7-bit {{character set}} in the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> of the 8-bit character set, {{it should not be}} confused with ASMO 708. In the character sets that allocate ASMO 449 (or some variant of it) in the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> of the 8-bit character set, the existence of apparently repeated characters is due to the fact that the characters in the lower part are for left-to-right script while the characters in the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> are for right-to-left script. When ASMO 449 (or some variant of it) is allocated to the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> of the 8-bit character set, it has Arabic digits.|$|R
5|$|The female Eurasian {{treecreeper}} forages {{primarily on}} the <b>upper</b> <b>parts</b> of the tree trunks, while the male uses the lower parts. A study in Finland found that if a male disappears, the unpaired female will forage at lower heights, spend less time on each tree and have shorter foraging bouts than a paired female.|$|E
5|$|Above {{the hall}} {{is a second}} hall, forming part of the Duchess' suite of rooms. An oratory in the south wall, {{overlooking}} the courtyard, contains a piscina and credence niche. The oratory gives access to mural passages leading to the walkway along the curtain wall. The timber ceiling of the Duchess' hall, and the timber floors and roof above, are of the 1880s. The <b>upper</b> <b>parts</b> of the stonework are among the repairs dating from 1580.|$|E
5|$|Airline EasyJet is {{interested}} in the inspection of aircraft with drones. It made a first inspection in 2015. Equipped with laser sensors and high resolution camera, the drone performs autonomous flight around the aeroplane. It generates a three-dimensional image of the aircraft and transmits it to a technician. The operator can then navigate in this representation and zoom to display a high-resolution picture of some parts of the aircraft. The operator must then visually diagnose {{the presence or absence of}} defects. This approach avoids the use of platforms to observe the <b>upper</b> <b>parts</b> of the aeroplane.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wall}} that {{separated}} the <b>upper</b> and lower <b>parts</b> was a gate {{that led to the}} <b>upper</b> <b>part.</b> The <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> did not have buildings, but there remains a pathway to the stairs up to gateIV, which is 2metres off the ground, right next to tower 3.|$|R
50|$|A bicornuate uterus {{is formed}} during embryogenesis. The fusion {{process of the}} <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> of the paramesonephric ducts is altered. As a result, {{the lower part of}} the uterus is unitary while the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> is bifurcated.|$|R
50|$|The <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> of Japanese islands {{was created}} {{at the edge}} of Eurasian plate 180 million years ago.Then, 50 million years later, the lower part was created at the {{southern}} part of Yangtze continent. The lower part then rode on Izanagi plate and moved to the <b>upper</b> <b>part.</b> These islands were incorporated and formed the Japanese islands 70 million years ago. The boundary line between the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> and lower part is the MTL.|$|R
5|$|In the event, Titanics heading changed {{just in time}} {{to avoid}} a head-on collision, but the change in {{direction}} caused the ship to strike the iceberg with a glancing blow. An underwater spur of ice scraped along the starboard side of the ship for about seven seconds; chunks of ice dislodged from <b>upper</b> <b>parts</b> of the berg fell onto her forward decks. A few minutes later, all of Titanics engines were stopped, leaving the ship facing north and drifting in the Labrador Current.|$|E
5|$|Late in the Nineteenth Dynasty the Book of Caverns, which {{divided the}} underworld into massive caverns {{containing}} deities {{as well as}} the deceased waiting for the sun to pass through and restore them to life, was placed in the <b>upper</b> <b>parts</b> of tombs. A complete version appears in the tomb of Ramesses VI. The burial of Ramesses III saw the Book of the Earth, where the underworld is divided into four sections, climaxing in the sun disc being pulled from the earth by Naunet.|$|E
5|$|Recently the Canning Dam {{has been}} {{subjected}} to considerable cracking of the <b>upper</b> <b>parts</b> of the dam and upper gallery. Investigations have shown that cracking was due to strong AAR (alkali aggregate reactivity) in the concrete. AAR results in swelling of the concrete, which may cause secondary compressive stresses, localised map cracks, and, ultimately structural cracks. In addition, the concrete tensile strength and elasticity significantly decreases. Many old concrete dams are known to suffer from AAR, including Fontana Dam in Tennessee and Pian Telessio dam in Italy among others.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the project in 2013, the Air-Cobot robot is dedicated to inspect the lower parts of an aircraft. In the continuation of the project, there is the prospect of coupling with a drone to inspect an aircraft's <b>upper</b> <b>parts.</b> In October 2016, Airbus Group launches its research project on the hangar of the future in Singapour. The robots from the Air-Cobot and Aircam projects are included in it.|$|E
5|$|The Church of St John the Baptist {{belonged to}} the {{northern}} fortifications of medieval Asenovgrad (then known in Greek as Stenimachos). It was in continuous operation until the late 18th or early 19th century, when it suffered significant damage, perhaps during Ottoman brigand raids. During the reconstruction works which were carried out soon thereafter, the roof and the <b>upper</b> <b>parts</b> of the church were modified. The interior was also repainted at the time.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{was built}} using the trace italienne style popular during the seventeenth century; its floor has a {{geometric}} design, and bastions {{are the main}} defensive elements. However, unlike other permanent bastioned fortifications, its defensive walls were designed as two sections: {{the lower part of}} the wall is vertical (perpendicular to the base) and the upper part, above the string course, is inclined inwards. This design makes the fort unique in Venezuela; in most castles, the lower portion of the walls inclines outwards at the base and the <b>upper</b> <b>parts</b> are vertical (perpendicular to the base).|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a prosthetic foot with a core piece (14) and an envelope (22) {{at least partially}} surrounding the core piece (14), {{with at least one}} pressure chamber (21) that can be filled with a medium, wherein the core piece (14) comprises a foot <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> (24) and a heel <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> (25), and the envelope (22) bears on the foot <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> (24) and the heel <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> (25) of the core piece (14), characterized in that the envelope (22) extends from a heel area (27) adjoining the heel <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> (25) {{at least as far as}} the metatarsal area (31) and forms a continuous sole (28), and at least one shape-stablizing element (41) is provided which extends along the foot <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> (24) at least as far as the metatarsal area (31) and acts on the envelope (22), such that, during the rollover of the prosthetic foot (11), the envelope (22); adapted to the shape of the foot is yielding in the front foot area (32) and, after the rollover, the foot shape formed by the envelope (22) is returned again to a starting position, in which the envelope (22) simulates a natural foot position...|$|R

50|$|The town can {{be divided}} into a lower and an <b>upper</b> <b>part.</b> The lower part used to be called Canipaan because of the {{presence}} of nipa swamps in this part of the town, while the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> is named Ibabao, being located on a plateau.|$|R
5|$|The {{esophagus}} {{is one of}} the <b>upper</b> <b>parts</b> of {{the digestive}} system. There are taste buds on its upper part. It begins {{at the back of the}} mouth, passing downwards through the rear part of the mediastinum, through the diaphragm, and into the stomach. In humans, the esophagus generally starts around the level of the sixth cervical vertebra behind the cricoid cartilage of the trachea, enters the diaphragm at about the level of the tenth thoracic vertebra, and ends at the cardia of the stomach, at the level of the eleventh thoracic vertebra. The esophagus is usually about 25cm (10in) in length.|$|E
5|$|The female is {{very similar}} to the male but the <b>upper</b> <b>parts</b> are {{somewhat}} more brownish and the feathers on the crown have narrower black central stripes. The throat and breast are paler with fewer, smaller markings. The beak is similar to the male's winter beak. The juvenile are a duller colour than the adults with pale coloured streaks on the feathers that have dark streaks in the adult. The young assume their adult plumage after their first moult in the autumn.|$|E
5|$|The {{red-headed}} myzomela {{closely resembles}} the scarlet myzomela, {{though there is}} only a small overlap in their respective ranges, in eastern Cape York Peninsula. The latter species lives in woodlands rather than mangroves. The dusky myzomela resembles the female red-headed myzomela, but is larger and darker brown, and lacks the red markings around the bill. The Sumba myzomela is similar but slightly smaller than the red-headed myzomela and has darker <b>upper</b> <b>parts</b> and a broad black pectoral band.|$|E
50|$|The <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> of Mount Chambers is {{composed}} of a limestone that is resistant to erosion.

50|$|This {{important}} {{site has}} {{two levels of}} architectural style. The lower part is Romanic as with many Pugliese churches. The <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> is a very remarkable example of Baroque. The <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> was reconstructed after an earthquake that destroyed {{a great part of}} the historical centre.|$|R
50|$|The {{individual}} ethnographic groups (Boyko, Lemko, PogÃ³rzanie and Dolinians) {{are arranged}} in separate sections which perfectly fit the landscape physiography: the Bojko and Lemko architecture was located in the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> of the Park, whereas that of the PogÃ³rzanie and in the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> of the area.|$|R
5|$|The {{subspecies}} californicus {{usually has}} a longer bill {{compared to the}} nominate, and has brown-grey inner primaries during the breeding season. When not breeding, the nominate has diffuse and pale lores less often than Podiceps nigricollis californicus. The other subspecies, P. n. gurneyi, is {{the smallest of the}} three subspecies, in addition to having a greyer head and <b>upper</b> <b>parts.</b> The adult of this subspecies also has a rufous-brown tinge on its lesser wing-coverts. It also lacks a non-breeding plumage, in addition to the tufts on the side of its head being paler.|$|E
5|$|A few {{structures}} {{built by}} the Muisca still exist today; the Cojines del Zaque ("cushions of the zaque") in Tunja are two round stones with inclined <b>upper</b> <b>parts</b> used for religious ceremonies. Of the Goranchacha Temple, a circle of pillars remained, located on the terrains of the UPTC, also in Tunja. The holiest temple of the Muisca, the Sun Temple in sacred City of the Sun Sugamuxi had been destroyed by fire when the Spanish conquerors looted the shrine and has been rebuilt based on archaeological research by EliÃ©cer Silva Celis. The temple {{is part of the}} Archaeology Museum of the city in BoyacÃ¡.|$|E
5|$|Alcelaphus lelwel x cokii: Known as the Kenya Highland {{hartebeest}} or the Laikipia hartebeest. It is a {{cross between}} the Lelwel and Coke's hartebeest. This hybrid is lighter in colour and larger than Coke's hartebeest. It is a light buff with reddish-tawny <b>upper</b> <b>parts,</b> and the head is longer than in Coke's hartebeest. Both sexes have horns, which are heavier as well as longer {{than those of the}} parents. It was formerly distributed throughout the western Kenyan highlands, between Lake Victoria and Mount Kenya, but is now believed to be restricted to the Lambwe Valley (south-west Kenya) and Laikipia and nearby regions of west-central Kenya.|$|E
