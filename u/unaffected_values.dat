40|$|Background: Residual neuromuscular {{blockade}} {{increases the}} risk to develop postoperative complications. The authors hypothesized that minimal neuromuscular blockade (train-of-four [TOF] ratio 0. 5 - 1) increases upper airway collapsibility and impairs upper airway dilator muscle compensatory responses to negative pharyngeal pressure challenges. Methods: Epiglottic and nasal mask pressures, genioglossus electromyogram, respiratory timing, and changes in lung volume were measured in awake healthy volunteers (n = 3 D 15) before, during (TOF = 3 D 0. 5 and 0. 8 [steady state]), and after recovery of TOF to unity from rocuronium-induced partial neuromuscular blockade. Passive upper airway closing pressure (negative pressure drops, random order, range + 2 to - 30 cm H 2 O) and pressure threshold for flow limitation were determined. Results: Upper airway closing pressure increased (was less negative) significantly from baseline by 54 +/- 4. 4 % (means +/- SEM), 37 +/- 4. 2 %, and 16 +/- 4. 1 % at TOF ratios of 0. 5, 0. 8, and 1. 0, respectively (P < 0. 01 vs. baseline for any level). Phasic genioglossus activity almost quadrupled in response to negative (- 20 cm H 2 O) pharyngeal pressure at baseline, and this increase was significantly impaired by 57 +/- 44 % and 32 +/- 6 % at TOF ratios of 0. 5 and 0. 8, respectively (P < 0. 01 vs. baseline). End-expiratory lung volume, respiratory rate, and tidal volume did not change. Conclusion: Minimal neuromuscular blockade markedly increases upper airway closing pressure, partly by impairing the genioglossus muscle compensatory response. Increased airway collapsibility despite <b>unaffected</b> <b>values</b> for resting ventilation may predispose patients to postoperative respiratory complications, particularly during airway challenges.

40|$|The topological {{protected}} electronic {{states on}} the surface of a topological insulator can progressively change their Fermi cross-section from circular to a snowflake shape as the chemical potential is increased above the Dirac point because of an hexagonal warping term in the Hamiltonian. Another effect of warping is to change the spin texture which exists when a finite gap is included by magnetic doping, although the in-plane spin component remains locked perpendicular to momentum. It also changes the orbital magnetic moment, the matrix element for optical absorption and the circular dichroism. We find that the Fermi surface average of z-component of spin is closely related to the value of the Berry phase. This holds even when the Hamiltonian includes a subdominant non-relativistic quadratic in momentum term (which provides particle-hole asymmetry) in addition to the dominant relativistic Dirac term. There is also a qualitative correlation between 〈 S_z 〉 and the dichroism. For the case when the chemical potential falls inside the gap between valence and conduction band, the Hall conductivity remains quantized and <b>unaffected</b> in <b>value</b> by the hexagonal warping term.

Specifically, we {{intended to}} elucidate the kind of relationship between the task performance and best corrected binocular visual acuity and to determine the threshold of visual acuity when task performance starts to deteriorate. MethodsNinety-five individuals with different best corrected visual acuity {{participated in the study}} (age 49 ± 12 years, mean±SD, 27 men and 68 women). The participants manually traced maze-like visual patterns of different spatial complexity presented on the screen of a portable notebook computer using Clinical Kinematic Assessment Tool software. Tracing error was computed as performance measure in each trial with a spatial pattern matching technique – rigid point set registration method. ResultsThe segmented linear regression analysis showed that the relation between visual acuity and tracing errors was best described with a regression function having a break point between two data segments. Tracing performance was <b>unaffected</b> by <b>values</b> of visual acuity below 0. 2 on logMAR scale, but when logMAR values increased above this critical limit (i. e. when visual acuity is further reduced), tracing errors linearly increased. The rate of the increase of the tracing error correlated with the complexity of visual stimulus shape.

The films have ben deposited from mixtures of SiH 4, O- 2 and N- 2, using the electron cyclotron resonance-chemical vapor deposition technique, with substrate temperature ranging from room temperature (50 degrees C) to 200 degrees C. When substrate temperature is increased, a slight decrease in both Si-H and N-H bond concentration is detected. A small shift (10 - 17 cm(- 1)) in the dominant Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) absorption peak (Si-O/Si-N stretching band) seems {{to be associated with}} a decrease in the N-H bond concentration. This behavior is attributed to the formation of Si-N bonds at the expense of N-H bonds, with no significant change in the film composition. Full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the dominant FTIR peak decreases as temperature is increased for all the composition range, indicating an improvement in the quality of the films. Silicon oxide films (SiO 2. 0) deposited at 200 degrees C show improved properties with respect to those deposited at room temperature. FWHM decreases from 95 to 87 cm(- 1), and the shoulder-to-peak ratio from 0. 29 to 0. 22.

Within families d. es vary in amplitude between a few preferred <b>values</b> <b>unaffected</b> by any treatments used in these experiments. As [Ca]o is raised from 1. 1 to 4. 0 mM there is a rise in d. e. amplitude due to an increase in the frequency of large events and a decrease in that of small.

Both drug effects are concentration-dependent in the range 5 X 10 (- 9) - 10 (- 6) M. As [Ca]o is raised from 1. 1 to 4. 0 mM, and therefore more natural agonist is released, clonidine becomes more effective at altering d. e. amplitude whereas yohimbine becomes less so.

Silica cementation {{is in the}} form of syntaxial quartz overgrowths (Fig.  8 a), a cementing agent feature that binds quartz grains together and effectively reduces existing pore spaces. Quartz overgrowths tend to grow in equant crystal shapes and are separated from detrital grains by a dust rim. They are an important reservoir quality-deteriorating mechanism in many deep petroleum reservoirs (Worden and Morad 2000) and are a major reason for decreasing porosity in many petroleum reservoirs in moderately to deeply buried sandstone reservoirs (Imam 1986; Worden and Morad 2003). In the studied samples, the quartz overgrowths coating the detrital quartz grains results in the reduction of pore diameter and consequently decreases the porosity and permeability. Calcite and quartz cements commonly coexist in sandstones and may show evidence of replacement of one mineral by the other. Changes in pH may cause solution of one phase and precipitation of another (Blatt et al. 1980).

40|$|A photon-like wavepacket {{based on}} novel {{solutions}} of Maxwell's equations is proposed. It {{is believed to}} be the first 'classical' model that contains so many of the accepted quantum features. In this new work, novel solutions to Maxwell's classical equations in dispersive guides are considered where local helical twists with an arbitrary angular frequency W modulate a classical mode (angular frequency w, group velocity vg). The modal field patterns are unchanged, apart from the twist, provided that the helical velocity vh equals vg. Pairs of resonating retarded and advanced waves with modal and helical frequencies (w,W) and (w,-W) respectively, trap one temporal period of the underlying classical mode forming a photon-like packet provided W = (M+ 1 / 2) w: 'Schrodinger' frequencies. This theory supports experimental evidence that the photon velocity does not change with M in dispersive systems. Promotion and demotion increase or decrease the helical frequencies in units of w. An energy of interaction between retarded and advanced waves in the wave-packet is also proportional to these helical frequencies W = (M+ 1 / 2) w similar to Planck's law. Group velocity and polarisation are <b>unaffected</b> by the <b>value</b> of M.

The relative arch deformity (RAD) was calculated with both 10 % and 90 % weight bearing (WB). Static balance was evaluated with Single Leg Stance Test and dynamic balance with TechnoBody PK 200 WL computerized balance device.

Increased arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid concentrations may be related to reduced lipid peroxidation, which is a feature of rapidly growing cells.

A total of 960 fifty-three wk-old laying hens were randomly allotted into five groups and each of six replicates with 32 birds. The birds were fed wheat-soybean meal-based diets supplemented with 0, 0. 1 %, 0. 2 %, 0. 4 % and 0. 8 % PE respectively. The experiment lasted 4 weeks. RFC value linearly increased with an increase in dietary PE (P < 0. 01) and achieved 9. 9 when dietary PE added by 0. 8 %. L* value of egg yolk decreased with increase in dietary PE (P < 0. 05), The a* value linearly increased with an increase in dietary PE (P < 0. 01), while b* <b>value</b> <b>unaffected</b> (P< 0. 05). There were no effect of dietary PE on Haugh unit and cholesterol content in yolk (P< 0. 05). However, carotenoid content in yolk linearly increased with an increase in dietary PE (P < 0. 01). No differences were observed in egg size, laying rate, feed intake and feed conversion among dietary treatments (P< 0. 05). The results indicated supplementation of paprika extract significantly improved egg yolk color when hens fed wheat-based diet and yolk coloration could reach an ideal grade when paprika extract added by 0. 8 %...|$|R
40|$|Background: The GRPR-antagonist-based radioligands [67 / 68 Ga/ 111 In/ 177 Lu]NeoBOMB 1 {{have shown}} {{excellent}} theragnostic profiles in preclinical prostate cancer models, while [68 Ga]NeoBOMB 1 effectively visualized prostate cancer lesions in patients. We were further interested {{to explore the}} theragnostic potential of NeoBOMB 1 in GRPR-positive mammary carcinoma, by first studying [67 Ga]NeoBOMB 1 in breast cancer models; Methods: We investigated the profile of [67 Ga]NeoBOMB 1, a [68 Ga]NeoBOMB 1 surrogate, in GRPR-expressing T- 47 D cells and animal models; Results: NeoBOMB 1 (IC 50 s of 2. 2 ± 0. 2 nM) and [natGa]NeoBOMB 1 (IC 50 s of 2. 5 ± 0. 2 nM) exhibited high affinity for the GRPR. At 37 °C [67 Ga]NeoBOMB 1 strongly bound to the T- 47 D cell-membrane (45. 8 ± 0. 4 % at 2 h), internalizing poorly, as was expected for a radioantagonist. [67 Ga]NeoBOMB 1 was detected > 90 % intact in peripheral mouse blood at 30 min pi. In mice bearing T- 47 D xenografts, [67 Ga]NeoBOMB 1 specifically localized in the tumor (8. 68 ± 2. 9 % ID/g vs. 0. 6 ± 0. 1 % ID/g during GRPR-blockade at 4 h pi). The unfavorably high pancreatic uptake could be considerably reduced (206. 29 ± 17. 35 % ID/g to 42. 46 ± 1. 31 % ID/g at 4 h pi) by increasing the NeoBOMB 1 dose from 10 pmol to 200 pmol, whereas tumor uptake remained <b>unaffected.</b> Notably, tumor <b>values</b> did not decline from 1 to 24 h pi; Conclusions: [67 Ga]NeoBOMB 1 can successfully target GRPR-positive breast cancer in animals with excellent prospects for clinical translation...|$|R
40|$|Aminopeptidase A (EC 3. 4. 11. 7, APA) is a 130 kDa membrane-bound {{aminopeptidase}} {{that contains}} the consensus sequence HEXXH (385 - 389) found in the zinc metalloprotease family, the zincins. Sequence alignment of the mouse APA with other monozinc-aminopeptidases indicates {{the presence of a}} highly conserved glutamate residue (Glu 352 in APA) found in the conserved motif GAMEN (349 - 353). In monozinc-aminopeptidases, the negative charge of the glutamate side-chain carboxylate may constitute the anionic binding site involved in the recognition of the free amino group of substrates or inhibitors. The functional role of Glu 352 in APA was investigated by substituting this residue with an aspartate (Asp 352), a glycine (Gly 352), a glutamine (Gln 352) or an arginine (Arg 352) residue by site-directed mutagenesis. Kinetic studies showed that the Km values of the mutant enzymes were <b>unaffected,</b> whereas kcat <b>values</b> were decreased 10 - 250 -fold, resulting in a 10 -, 30 - 260 - and 400 -fold reduction in cleavage efficiencies for the mutants Asp 352, Gly 352, Gln 352 and Arg 352 respectively. The inhibitory potency of two different classes of inhibitors, a thiol and a phosphonate compound, was significantly (P< 0. 05) decreased by 10 - and 4 -fold respectively in the mutated enzymes. Moreover, the inhibitory potency of angiotensin I, used as a competitor of the synthetic substrate alpha-l-glutamyl beta-naphthylamide, displayed a 4 -fold reduction (P< 0. 01) in the mutated enzymes, whereas the Ki values of its N-acetyl derivative were unchanged. These data strongly suggest that Glu 352 is involved in the catalytic process of APA and contributes to the exopeptidase activity of this enzyme through interaction with the N-terminal part of substrates or inhibitors...|$|R
40|$|Objectives The primary aim of {{this study}} was to assess the intrarater {{reliability}} of ultrasonographic measurements of acromion-greater tuberosity (AGT) distance in patients with stroke using portable ultrasound. A secondary aim was to determine the discriminant validity of the ultrasonographic technique by comparison of AGT distance measurements of stroke-affected and unaffected shoulders. Design Test–retest design. Setting Two local National Health Service hospitals in the South West of England. Participants Patients with first-time stroke (N= 26; 16 men, 10 women; mean age ± SD, 71 ± 10 y) with 1 -sided weakness who gave informed consent were recruited. Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures Portable diagnostic ultrasound was used to record measurements on day 1 and again within a fortnight. Bedside measurements were undertaken by a single physical therapist with patients seated upright in a standard hospital chair. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and standard errors of measurement were used to assess reliability. Minimum detectable change (MDC 90) scores were used to estimate the magnitude of change that is likely to exceed measurement error. Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess discriminant validity. Results Mean ± SD AGT distances on the stroke-affected side and unaffected side were 2. 3 ± 0. 6 cm and 1. 9 ± 0. 3 cm, respectively. ICC for within-day reliability was. 98 for the affected shoulder and. 95 for the <b>unaffected</b> shoulder. Corresponding <b>values</b> for between-day reliability were. 94 and. 76. The standard error of measurement for both affected and unaffected shoulders was less than 0. 2 cm. Within-day MDC 90 for the affected shoulder and the unaffected shoulder was ± 0. 2 cm and ± 0. 1 cm, respectively. Repeated-measures ANOVA showed a significant difference between mean AGT distance for the affected and unaffected shoulders. Conclusions Ultrasonographic measurement of AGT distance demonstrates both intrarater reliability and discriminant validity and has the potential to assess shoulder subluxation in patients with stroke. Research into interrater reliability and concurrent validity of ultrasonographic measurements of AGT distance in patients with stroke is required...|$|R
40|$|Aim. Atherosclerosis {{is a slow}} {{disease process}} of {{arterial}} walls with onset decades prior to its clinical manifestations. Lifelong follow-up data may help to identify and understand the pathophysiology of this process. These longitudinal data are scarce. Using a standardized imaging and image analysis protocol, we acquired cross-sectional data of carotid and femoral arterial wall segments in populations at different cardiovascular disease risk. Methods. B-mode ultrasound intima-media thickness (IMT) data of carotid and femoral arteries were acquired in individuals at high cardiovascular disease risk: 44 young adolescents with familial hypercholesterolemia (1711), 248 adult FH patients and 184 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), {{as well as in}} disease free unaffected individuals, 44 young adolescents, 26 middle-aged adults and 48 senior adults. Results. Per patient combined average IMT (SD) and % of lesions in the high risk populations were 0. 55 (0. 05) mm, 0. 1 %, 0. 86 (0. 18) mm, 15 %, and 0. 9 (0. 18) nun, 18 %, respectively. In the <b>unaffected</b> groups these <b>values</b> were 0. 53 (0. 03) nun, 0 %, 0. 59 (0. 07) mm, 0 %, and 0. 77 (0. 12) nun, 8 %. Of all arterial segments, the far wall of the common femoral artery (CIA) of the 1711 patients exhibited the highest absolute BIT (1. 12 [0. 61] mm), the most rapid estimated IMT increase since adolescence (+ 0. 58 mm) and the highest percentage of lesions (39 % of CIA measurements). Conclusion. Regardless of location, carotid and femoral arterial walls increase in thickness with age and cardiovascular disease risk. This increase in thickness and prevalence of lesions is not similarly distributed among anatomical segments. The strong preponderance in arterial wall segments with the highest estimated atherosclerosis progression indicates the existence of a threshold value beyond which plaque formation is greatly increased. In the set of arterial locations we studied, this process might be best represented by the far wall of the CIA...|$|R
