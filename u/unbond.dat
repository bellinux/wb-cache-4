Testing was performed at M- 111, the Thiokol Corp. Inert Parts Preparation Building. The purpose of the inspection was to verify {{the integrity of the}} capture feature area case-to-insulation bondline. The capture feature scanner was calibrated over an intentional 1. 0 to 1. 0 in. case-to-insulation <b>unbond.</b> The capture feature scanner was then used to scan 60 deg of a capture feature field joint. Calibration of the capture feature scanner was then rechecked over the intentional <b>unbond</b> to ensure that the calibration settings did not change during the case scan. This procedure was successfully performed five times to qualify the <b>unbond</b> detection capability of the capture feature scanner. The capture feature scanner qualified in this test contains many points of mechanical instability that can affect the overall ultrasonic signal response. A new generation scanner, designated the sigma scanner, should be implemented to replace the current configuration scanner.

The condition of both motors was similar to previous flights. Sixteen aft edge hits were noted on the ground environment instrumentation thermal protection system. Each hit left a clean substrate, indicating that the damage was caused by nozzle severance debris and/or water impact. No National Space and Transporation System debris criteria for missing thermal protection system were violated. One 5. 0 by 1. 0 in. <b>unbond</b> was observed on the left hand center field joint K 5 NA closeout and was elevated to an in-flight anomaly (STS- 34 -M- 4) by the NASA Ice/Debris team. Aft edge damage to the K 5 NA and an associated black streak indicate that burning debris from the nozzle severance system was the likely cause of the damage. Minor divots caused by debris were seen on previous flights, {{but this is the}} first occurrence of a K 5 NA <b>unbond.</b> Since the <b>unbond</b> occurred after booster separation there is no impact on flight safety and no corrective actions was taken. The right hand center field joint primary heater failed the dielectric withstanding voltage test after joint closeout.

40|$|A {{modified}} version of the computer program written by Chan (1986) for the analysis of <b>unbonded</b> prestressed concrete members under third point loading was developed. The new program carries out the analysis more quickly and efficiently while still maintaining the required accuracy level. The program was used to analyse twenty-two <b>unbonded</b> beams with bonded steel tested in China and twelve <b>unbonded</b> slabs with bonded steel and a futher six <b>unbonded</b> slabs without bonded steel tested at the University of Canterbury. All analytical and experimental results were compared. The comparison revealed that the theoretical analyses gave good representation of the flexural behaviour of the <b>unbonded</b> concrete members both with and without bonded reinforcement. The report confirms the Chinese finding that the combined reinforcement index has very significant effect on the ultimate tendon stress increase and moment capacity for the <b>unbonded</b> members However, the effect of span-depth ratio on the flexural behaviour of <b>unbonded</b> partially prestressed concrete members was not significant. It is also confirmed that the <b>unbonded</b> members with bonded reinforcement behave in a more effective way than those without bonded reinforcement. The report recommends that bonded reinforcement should be used in design practice. Two recommendations based on experimental results are proposed for the determination of ultimate moment capacity of <b>unbonded</b> partially prestressed concrete members. The proposed expressions for member without bonded reinforcement is given just for comparison and it is not recommended for use in practical design. It is also recommended that the value of the combined reinforcement index chosen should be greater than 0. 06 to prevent the occurrence of flexural instability and less than 0. 305 for efficient design of the <b>unbonded</b> system. Value greater than 0. 305 lead to a compression failure resulting in a low value of ultimate tendon stress increase and no increase in moment capacity...|$|R

30|$|The {{compression}} or tension-controlled {{failure mode}} of concrete beams prestressed with <b>unbonded</b> FRP tendons {{is governed by}} the relative amount of prestressing tendon to the balanced one. Explicit assessment to determine the balanced reinforcement ratio of a beam with <b>unbonded</b> tendons (ρ_pfb^U) is difficult because it requires a priori knowledge of the deformed beam geometry in order to evaluate the <b>unbonded</b> tendon strain. In this study, a theoretical evaluation of ρ_pfb^U is presented based on a concept of three equivalent rectangular curvature blocks for simply supported concrete beams internally prestressed with <b>unbonded</b> carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) tendons. The equivalent curvature blocks were iteratively refined to closely simulate beam rotations at the supports, mid-span beam deflection, and member-dependent strain of the <b>unbonded</b> tendon at the ultimate state.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a numerical method for the full-range analysis of prestressed concrete flexural members with <b>unbonded</b> tendons, {{taking into account}} the stress-path dependence of materials. The numerical results compare favourably with experimental results. Parametric studies are carried out to evaluate the influence of loading type, span-depth ratio, combined reinforcement index (CRI), partial prestressing ratio, concrete compressive strength, and ratio of compressive reinforcement, etc. on the ductility behaviour. The results indicate that the curvature ductility factor of prestressed concrete members with <b>unbonded</b> tendons decreases with the increase of CRI. The curvature ductility factors for members with bonded and <b>unbonded</b> tendons for given values of CRI are also analyzed and compared. It is generally observed that when the CRI is between 0. 15 and 0. 20, the ductility factor of an <b>unbonded</b> member is close to that of the bonded one. Above this range of CRI the ductility factor of an <b>unbonded</b> member is higher than that of a bonded one, while below this range the ductility factor of an <b>unbonded</b> member is lower than that of a bonded one. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
