5|$|The two {{combined}} battalions began {{digging in}} around Isurava. A headquarters {{had been set}} <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the hill, which was vital to the defence of the position. While the Australians dug themselves in, the Japanese, led by Japanese Major General Tomitarō Horii, prepared to attack. On 28 August, the Japanese launched their offensive. The Australians, who had initially been outnumbered but were now roughly equal in strength, resisted {{in the face of}} heavy machine-gun fire and hand-to-hand combat. On 29 August, the Japanese broke through the right flank, pushing the Australians back with heavy fire, threatening to cut off their headquarters. The Australians began to prepare a counter-offensive, and men volunteered to join an attack party. Kingsbury, one of the few survivors of his platoon, ran down the Track with the group. Using a Bren gun he had taken from wounded Corporal Lindsay Bear, Kingsbury, alongside Avery {{and the rest of the}} group, engaged the nearby Japanese. The fire was so heavy that the undergrowth was completely destroyed within five minutes. It was then that Kingsbury, firing from his hip, charged straight at the Japanese.|$|E
25|$|Their protest {{blocked the}} north eastern {{junction}} of O'Connell Street and Parnell Street. The small Republican Sinn Féin group (and some activists from the Irish Republican Socialist Party) {{were joined by}} several hundred local youths. Before the violence broke out, they chanted republican chants. Several thousand bystanders were also on the scene, but took no part in the subsequent rioting. When the marchers had formed <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> Parnell Square and their bands began to play {{in anticipation of the}} start of the march, gardaí attempted to disperse the protest at around 12:45. At this point, scuffles broke out between protesters and Gardaí.|$|E
500|$|Seventeen of {{the riders}} {{remaining}} in the race chose not {{to compete in the}} final stage. Caleb Fairly (...) was the first to start and completed the course in [...] The first significant time was set by Adam Yates, who crossed the finish line with a time of 30' 06". This time remained the best time until the eighth-placed rider overnight – Nairo Quintana – set a time of [...] Other well placed riders, including Pinot, Rodríguez and Landa, struggled on the steep climb. At the top of the climb, Quintana changed from a road bicycle to a time trial bicycle. The only rider able to beat Quintana's time was Alberto Contador. He was 23 seconds <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the climb and finished five seconds ahead by the finish line. Cyclingnews.com suggested after the stage that Quintana's bike change may have cost him the stage victory. Henao, who had lost 46 seconds to Contador on the climb, finished 18 seconds behind and fell to second place overall.|$|E

2500|$|Twente won 16 of 17 home {{matches in}} the Eredivisie league that season and lost just two away. Twente {{withstood}} immense pressure from Martin Jol's Ajax (who won their last 14 {{games in a}} row and had a goal difference of +86, more than double Twente's +40) {{during the second half of}} the season and trumped the Amsterdam side by one point difference on the last day of the league to claim the title. Upon winning the championship, McClaren stated, [...] "Winning the Carling Cup with Middlesbrough was special but this is pretty much right <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> anything I've ever done. To win a championship in a foreign country with foreign coaches, I think it's made me stronger." ...|$|E
2500|$|Laleh {{began her}} music career in 2003. She founded her own {{production}} and publishing company 'Lost Army' {{and signed a}} recording and distribution contract with Warner Music Sweden before recording her first studio album. The sound of her early songs have been compared to adult contemporary artists such as Sting and Seal. She wrote, performed, and produced her self-titled debut, which was released {{in the spring of}} 2005 and saw a percentage of the proceeds go to charity. It became the highest selling album of the year with a recorded seventy-one weeks in the top sixty and reached number one on the Swedish chart. Critical praise was heaped on the album upon its release, although some noted that the album was too sprawling and genre-hopping. The first single from the album was [...] "Invisible (My Song)", which peaked at number seven in Sweden in February 2012. Follow-up [...] "Storebror" [...] failed to chart, but next single, [...] "Live Tomorrow" [...] had even greater success than [...] "Invisible" [...] and ended <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> [...] Sveriges Radio P3's radio show [...] "Tracks" [...] (Trackslistan) for several weeks. It peaked at number twenty on the Sverigetopplistan and also charted in Denmark. During 2005 she won numerous awards, including at the Swedish Grammis, where she received seven nominations and picked up three wins, including Artist of the Year, Producer of the Year, and New Artist of the Year. She was also nominated four times at the 2006 P3 Guld Awards and won Newcomer of the Year and Best Female Artist.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{interesting}} hydrogeologic {{feature is}} that some of the sinkholes appear to be in the process of closing <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> as crusts of travertine (a form of calcium carbonate) form at their surfaces.

50|$|There was a logjam <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> upon <b>the</b> {{conclusion}} {{of the first round}} with twenty seven players within two shots of the lead.

60|$|Rollo, {{looking down}} {{from the window of}} his uncle George's room, could see all these things very plainly; for the roof which {{protected}} the piazza from the rain was <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the hotel, and therefore did not interfere with his view.|$|E
60|$|The oldest {{boy looked}} <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the tree, shut one eye, {{and gave his}} head a little wag.

60|$|The chauffeur {{had lost}} his nerve. His cheeks were pale, his teeth were chattering. The engine, however, was still beating. Gradually the {{pressure}} of the water grew less.

"I don't {{remember}} much about it, except that I {{was afraid of}} the cellar and the dark entry, and always liked the cake and milk we had <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top.</b> If I wasn't too old for such things, I'd rather like to play it over again," [...] said Amy, who began to talk of renouncing childish things <b>at</b> <b>the</b> mature age of twelve.|$|R
50|$|From {{the picnic}} area, a track {{goes to the}} mountain, which is just over a {{kilometre}} away. There are good views of the Grose Valley as the track approaches the mountain, but the views disappear as the track gets higher <b>up.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>top,</b> there is a trigonometric station, {{but there are no}} views because of <b>the</b> timber. <b>The</b> <b>top</b> of <b>the</b> mountain is 944 m above sea level.|$|R
50|$|Kaboom! is an {{unauthorized}} {{adaptation of the}} 1978 Atari coin-op Avalanche. The gameplay of both games is fundamentally the same, but Kaboom! was re-themed to be about a mad bomber instead of falling rocks. As an ex-Atari programmer, Larry Kaplan, originally wanted to port Avalanche to the Atari 2600. In Avalanche all the boulders are lined <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> which is difficult to accomplish on the 2600, hence the shift to the Mad Bomber.|$|R
60|$|For a {{few moments}} Hezekiah stood irresolute. He looked about him. He looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the Metropolitan Tower. He saw no work there. He looked across at the skyscrapers on Madison Square, but his eye {{detected}} no work in any of them. He stood {{on his head and}} looked up at the flat-iron building. Still no work in sight.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, besides," [...] {{continued}} Mr. George, looking {{along the}} page of his guide book as he spoke, [...] "the air is so dry <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> this high hill, that {{the bodies of}} the old monks, who were buried there hundreds of years ago, did not corrupt, but they dried up and turned into a sort of natural mummies; and there they lie now under the church, in open coffins, in full view." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Voila!" [...] he {{was saying}} with many ejaculations and expletives, and a volley of excited gestures. [...] "Outside the Parc near the theatre two bourgeois hailed me, {{and one of them}} told me to draw <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the Galerie St. Hubert, which I did.

6000|$|... "The {{repairing}} slip is <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> by <b>the</b> foundry," [...] he said. [...] "I {{expect the}} brigantine to starboard has a rope out.

6000|$|... "She {{came down}} on Wednesday, when I was getting the apples in the morning.

I asked her didn't she think that free kind of life was the best, and that was how she {{answered}} me." ...|$|R
60|$|By and by {{we moved}} out, for 'twas eleven o'clock, and stands a bit upon the sidewalk. And {{then the man}} says he must be going home, and invites me and Tobin to walk that way.

6000|$|But {{the actual}} work proved very difficult. The first few {{insulators}} Harry put up himself. He {{was a good}} climber, but not being provided with the peculiar [...] "climbers" [...] used by the men who put up telegraph wires, he found {{it very hard to}} stay <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> a pole after he had got there, especially as he needed both hands to nail to the tree the wooden block to which the insulator was attached.|$|E
6000|$|... "You take my advice, Reuben," [...] Mr. Hudson said, [...] "don't you go {{and lose}} your heart; for if you once do, there's a police officer spoiled.

60|$|What more! A {{single shot}} from a trained hand and one-ideaed intellect settled the blacksmith's business, and {{temporarily}} ended this Iliad! I say temporarily, for Mr. Dodd, formerly deputy-sheriff, prudently pulled <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the hill, and observing his principal bend his head forwards {{and act like}} a drunken man, until he reeled, limp and sideways, from the saddle, and noticing further that Jeff took his place with a well-filled saddle-bag, concluded to follow cautiously and unobtrusively in the rear.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "good guy" [...] teams, {{consisting}} of the Yogi Yahooeys and the Scooby Doobies, are cooperative and loyal. The Really Rottens, however, always cheat, typically ending up in last place in most episodes. Typically the Really Rottens are just {{on the verge of}} winning, before they make a fatal error <b>at</b> <b>the</b> very end, allowing one of the other two teams to end <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top.</b> Occasionally, though, <b>the</b> Rottens' cheating was not actually against the rules, resulting in them actually winning.|$|R
50|$|Climbers have {{discovered}} and named over 60 routes up the rock. The precipitous North Crag (75 metres / 246 feet high) was first climbed by Jim Birkett on April Fools' Day, 1939, by a route called Overhanging Bastion. Since 2011 the North Crag {{has been considered}} dangerous because a large crack has opened <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> creating <b>the</b> potential for a massive rockfall. South Crag (35 metres / 115 feet high) is less steep, sunnier and quicker-drying, and holds the less difficult routes.|$|R
