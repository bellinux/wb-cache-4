5|$|Aston Villa have {{a unique}} {{relationship}} with the Acorns Children's Hospice charity that is groundbreaking in English football. In a first for the Premier League, Aston Villa donated {{the front of the}} shirt on their kit, <b>usually</b> <b>reserved</b> for high-paying sponsorships, to Acorns Hospice so that the charity would gain significant additional visibility and greater fund raising capabilities. Outside of the shirt sponsorship the club have paid for hospice care for the charity as well as regularly providing player visits to hospice locations.|$|E
5|$|Epaminondas was {{considered}} the greatest warrior-statesmen of ancient Thebes by many, including the Roman historian Diodorus Siculus. Diodorus does {{not have anything to}} say about the sexual orientation of Epaminondas or the Sacred Band, nor does he say anything about the following account, again from Plutarch (Amatorius 17). According to Plutarch's dramatic dialogue, Epaminondas had two male lovers: Asopichus and Caphisodorus, the latter died with him at Mantineia in battle. They were buried together, something <b>usually</b> <b>reserved</b> for a husband and wife in Greek society.|$|E
5|$|The {{first line}} therapy for aphthous {{stomatitis}} is topical agents rather than systemic medication, with topical corticosteroids being the mainstay treatment. Systemic treatment is <b>usually</b> <b>reserved</b> for severe disease {{due to the}} risk of adverse side effects associated with many of these agents. A systematic review found that no single systemic intervention was found to be effective. Good oral hygiene is important to prevent secondary infection of the ulcers.|$|E

5|$|Hieratic {{was used}} {{alongside}} hieroglyphs for writing in Old and Middle Egyptian, becoming the dominant form of writing in Late Egyptian. By the New Kingdom {{and throughout the}} rest of ancient Egyptian history, Middle Egyptian became a classical language that was <b>usually</b> <b>reserved</b> for reading and writing in hieroglyphs. For the rest of ancient Egyptian history, Middle Egyptian remained the spoken language for more exalted forms of literature, such as historical records, commemorative autobiographies, hymns, and funerary spells. However, Middle Kingdom literature written in Middle Egyptian was also rewritten in hieratic during later periods.|$|E
5|$|Milk was an {{important}} source of animal protein for those who could not afford meat. It would mostly come from cows, but milk from goats and sheep was also common. Plain fresh milk was not consumed by adults except the poor or sick, and was <b>usually</b> <b>reserved</b> for the very young or elderly. Poor adults would sometimes drink buttermilk or whey or milk that was soured or watered down. Fresh milk was overall less common than other dairy products {{because of the lack of}} technology to keep it from spoiling. On occasion it was used in upper-class kitchens in stews, but it was difficult to keep fresh in bulk and almond milk was generally used in its stead.|$|E
5|$|Not much of Nerva's {{early life}} or career is recorded, {{but it appears}} he did not pursue the usual {{administrative}} or military career. He was praetor-elect in the year 65 and, like his ancestors, moved in imperial circles as a skilled diplomat and strategist. As an advisor to Emperor Nero, he successfully helped detect and expose the Pisonian conspiracy of 65. His exact contribution to the investigation is not known, but his services must have been considerable, since they earned him rewards equal to those of Nero's guard prefect Tigellinus. He received triumphal honors — which was <b>usually</b> <b>reserved</b> for military victories — {{and the right to}} have his statues placed throughout the palace.|$|E

50|$|College dance squads {{are like}} {{traditional}} high school squads in that both include competition and performance dance, {{but there are}} many differences between the two. For example, a college squad will most likely dance on the sidelines at games or have a specific spot in the stands, whereas high schools <b>usually</b> <b>reserve</b> this activity for cheerleaders.|$|R
5000|$|Tensor {{products}} {{can be defined}} in great generality - for example, involving arbitrary modules over a ring. In principle, one could define a [...] "tensor" [...] simply to be an element of any tensor product. However, the mathematics literature <b>usually</b> <b>reserves</b> the term tensor for an element of a tensor product of any number of copies of a single vector space [...] and its dual, as above.|$|R
5|$|Some of {{the areas}} in the stable court are {{available}} for hire for charitable fund raising. The Long Room, which was refurbished in 1992 and now has {{the character of a}} large country house drawing room, can hold 150people. The former saddle room is now a dining room. The carriage room and adjoining buildings have been converted into the Wolf Room, which has a movable stage and audio-visual facilities. It can seat 200people and contains eight black-chalk pictures of birds by Joseph Wolf. The chapel is <b>usually</b> <b>reserved</b> for the family but in December each year it is used for carol concerts to raise money for charity.|$|E
5|$|The {{streets of}} Buenos Aires overflowed with huge piles of flowers. Within {{a day of}} Perón's death, all flower shops in Buenos Aires {{had run out of}} stock. Flowers would be flown in from all over the country, and as far away as Chile. Despite the fact that Eva Perón never held a {{political}} office, she was eventually given a state funeral <b>usually</b> <b>reserved</b> for a head of state, along with a full Roman Catholic requiem mass. A memorial was held for the Argentine team during the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki due to Eva Perón's death during those games.|$|E
5|$|Thin Lizzy, UFO and Judas Priest {{were already}} playing {{international}} arenas, when new heavy metal bands, composed of very young people, debuted in small venues {{in many cities}} in the UK. The country's larger venues were <b>usually</b> <b>reserved</b> for chart-topping disco music, because their use as rock music clubs was considered much less profitable. Like most British bands in the past, the new groups spent their formative years playing live in clubs, pubs, dance halls and social circles for low wages; this training honed their skills, created a local fan base and enabled them to {{come in contact with}} managers and record label agents.|$|E

Alternatively, in a coordinate-free notation one may use Riem for the Riemann tensor, Ric for the Ricci tensor and R for the curvature scalar.|$|R
30|$|Private rights apply on intensively managed lands, but farmers {{may allow}} {{communal}} {{access to some}} tree products. Permanent landholders <b>usually</b> <b>reserve</b> for themselves exclusive tree planting and felling rights, but may encourage tree pruning and gathering of tree products by other community members. Restrictions occur depending {{on the value of}} tree species and quantity harvested. Because planting in some extent confers ownership, permanent landholders generally do not authorize tree planting to those with secondary rights.|$|R
5|$|During {{the second}} settlement, Augustus was also granted {{the power of}} a tribune (tribunicia potestas) for life, though not the {{official}} title of tribune. For some years, Augustus had been awarded tribunicia sacrosanctitas, the immunity given to a Tribune of the Plebs. Now he decided to assume the full powers of the magistracy, renewed annually, in perpetuity. Legally, it was closed to patricians, a status that Augustus had acquired some years earlier when adopted by Julius Caesar. This power allowed him to convene the Senate and people at will and lay business before them, to veto the actions of either the Assembly or the Senate, to preside over elections, and to speak first at any meeting. Also included in Augustus' tribunician authority were powers <b>usually</b> <b>reserved</b> for the Roman censor; these included the right to supervise public morals and scrutinize laws to ensure that they were in the public interest, as well as the ability to hold a census and determine the membership of the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Hieratic is a simplified, cursive form of Egyptian hieroglyphs. Like hieroglyphs, hieratic {{was used}} in sacred and {{religious}} texts. By the 1st millennium BC, calligraphic hieratic became the script predominantly used in funerary papyri and temple rolls. Whereas the writing of hieroglyphs required the utmost precision and care, cursive hieratic could be written much more quickly and was therefore more practical for scribal record-keeping. Its primary purpose was {{to serve as a}} shorthand script for non-royal, non-monumental, and less formal writings such as private letters, legal documents, poems, tax records, medical texts, mathematical treatises, and instructional guides. Hieratic could be written in two different styles; one was more calligraphic and <b>usually</b> <b>reserved</b> for government records and literary manuscripts, the other was used for informal accounts and letters.|$|E
5|$|Lauren is interrogated by Mulder and Scully, {{and the two}} unknown {{agents that}} called them in, {{who say they are}} {{involved}} because they believe Graves and Dorlund's company sold technology to the Isfahan. Lauren admits to Mulder and Scully that the sales did indeed take place and that she believes Dorlund had Graves killed. After hearing Lauren recount the eerie circumstances that she believes are being caused by Graves' spirit, Scully - the <b>usually</b> <b>reserved</b> skeptic - readily accepts her story. Mulder is confused but, after Lauren leaves, Scully admits she was just humoring her. The agents search the company's premises, but are unable to find any evidence. When Dorlund attacks Lauren with a letter opener Graves' spirit takes it and cuts open the wallpaper, revealing a disc with evidence. Weeks later, Lauren starts her new job, but it appears that Graves' spirit may have followed her there.|$|E

This is also feasible as current DSRC or WAVE protocol running in the OBU supports multi-channel communication and <b>usually</b> <b>reserves</b> a dedicated broadcast channel to disseminate related information for safety applications, which usually include the vehicle’s position and velocity.|$|R
50|$|In A November 25, 2015 Bloomberg article, David Wainer {{wrote that}} “A wonkish TV show on Israel’s economy has struck a nerve {{in a country}} that <b>usually</b> <b>reserves</b> its fervor for debates about war and peace, giving new {{ammunition}} to opponents of government policies”, adding that “about one in eight Israelis tuned in to the three-part Silver Platter program, testimony to the depth of the discontent with the economy” and “Silver Platter has emerged as a cultural reference”.|$|R

Peter Buckley, the author of The Rough Guide to Rock, called the band [...] "one of the most primal, powerful, and experimental" [...] bands in the alternative metal scene.|$|R
5|$|Many {{treatment}} options for acne are available, including lifestyle changes, medications, and medical procedures. Eating fewer simple carbohydrates such as sugar may help. Treatments applied {{directly to the}} affected skin, such as azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and salicylic acid, are commonly used. Antibiotics and retinoids are available in formulations that are applied to the skin and taken by mouth {{for the treatment of}} acne. However, resistance to antibiotics may develop as a result of antibiotic therapy. Several types of birth control pills help against acne in women. Isotretinoin pills are <b>usually</b> <b>reserved</b> for severe acne due to greater potential side effects. Early and aggressive treatment of acne is advocated by some in the medical community to decrease the overall long-term impact to individuals.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the Delos mosaics and pavements include simple pebble constructions, chip-pavement made of white marble, ceramic fragments, and pieces of tesserae. The latter falls into two categories: the simpler, tessellated opus tessellatum using large pieces of tesserae, on average eight millimeters square, and the finer opus vermiculatum using pieces of tesserae smaller than four millimeters square. Many Delian mosaics use a mixture of these materials, while chip pavement is the most common. The latter is found in fifty-five homes and <b>usually</b> <b>reserved</b> for the ground floor. The majority of Delian mosaics comprise broken pieces of marble set into cement floors; other flooring bases are composed of either rammed earth or gneiss flagstones. Pavements in kitchens and latrines were built with pottery, brick, and tile fragments {{for the purpose of}} waterproofing. Thin strips of lead set into the cement are often used to distinguish the contours of geometric-patterned mosaics, but are absent in the more complex tessellated, figured mosaics.|$|E
5|$|There {{were three}} {{trenches}} {{in a typical}} front line sector; the fire trench, the support trench and the reserve trench, all joined by communication trenches. The trenches varied in depth, but they were usually {{about four or five}} feet deep, or in areas with a high water table a wall of sandbags would be built to allow the defenders to stand upright, fire trenches were provided with a fire step, so the occupants could return fire during an attack (see diagram). Ideally, the bottom of the trench was lined with duckboards to prevent men from sinking into the mud and dugouts were cut into the walls, these gave shelter from the elements and shrapnel, although in the British Army dugouts were <b>usually</b> <b>reserved</b> for the officers and senior NCOs. The men were then expected to sleep wherever they could and in wet weather they lived under groundsheets or in tents {{at the bottom of the}} trench on the duckboards.|$|E
5000|$|Milton Babbitt's serial {{theory of}} combinatoriality makes {{much of the}} {{properties}} of three-note, four-note, and six-note segments of a twelve-tone row, which he calls, respectively, trichords, tetrachords, and hexachords, extending the traditional sense of the terms and retaining their implication of contiguity. He <b>usually</b> <b>reserves</b> the term [...] "source set" [...] for their unordered counterparts (especially hexachords), but does occasionally employ terms such as [...] "source tetrachords" [...] and [...] "combinatorial trichords, tetrachords, and hexachords" [...] instead ( [...] ; [...] ).|$|R

5|$|During {{the worst}} of the storm, 5,800people were {{evacuated}} from shoreline areas of Kauai to temporary shelters. Strong waves sank or grounded several small vessels on the southwestern coast of Kauai, with 44 of the 45 boats at Port Allen being sunk. The worst of the damage from the hurricane occurred in Poipu, where the rough surf destroyed or severely damaged several exposed luxury hotels and condominiums. Elsewhere on the island, damage was greatest in areas where there was no protective barrier reef offshore. Several small aircraft were damaged at Lihue airport from the winds, including many overturned small planes. The winds destroyed several buildings across the island, including one of Kauai's oldest churches and a warehouse. Additionally, the winds destroyed the roof of a bank. Strong winds initially left the entire island of Kauai without power. Highway 56 {{on the east side of}} the island was obstructed by fallen telephone poles, forcing residents to drive on the unpaved, red dirt cane roads <b>usually</b> <b>reserved</b> for hauling sugar cane from the fields. Rising waters washed out multiple roads near the coastline. The strong winds destroyed nearly all papaya and banyan trees on the island. The hurricane destroyed or greatly damaged 1,907 homes on the island and caused minor damage to 2,983 others, leaving one-eighth of the island's homes unlivable.|$|E
5|$|Schnauzers have a {{specific}} groom cut that is standard among the Schnauzer breed. Schnauzers require regular grooming, either by stripping (mostly seen in show dogs), or by clipping (a short-cut <b>usually</b> <b>reserved</b> for family pets). Stripping removes the loose, dead coat; it may be done by hand, called finger stripping, or plucking, or with a stripping knife; either way, it is a laborious process. Many Miniature Schnauzers who are family pets have regular grooming appointments to have their hair clipped; clipping, using a mechanical clippers (or shaver), produces a soft, silky, skin-close trim. Whether stripped or clipped, the coat is close at the body, and falls into a fringe-like foundation on its undercarriage, called furnishings, which can be left to grow, but must be combed regularly. All Schnauzers, whether they are Miniatures, Standards, or Giants, often sport a beard, created by allowing the hair around their noses to grow out. Left unclipped or unstripped, the body hair will grow two to four inches, and will often tangle into mats and curls.|$|E
5|$|Sporadic {{experiments}} with numbered shirts {{took place in}} the 1920s but the idea did not initially catch on. The first major match in which numbers were worn was the 1933 FA Cup Final between Everton and Manchester City. Rather than the numbers being added to the clubs' existing strips, two special sets, one white and one red, were made for the final and allocated to the two teams by the toss of a coin. The Everton players wore numbers 1–11, while the City players wore 12–22. It was not until {{around the time of the}} Second World War that numbering became standard, with teams wearing numbers 1–11. Although there were no regulations on which player should wear which number, specific numbers came to be associated with specific positions on the field of play, a prime example being the number 9 shirt which was <b>usually</b> <b>reserved</b> for the team's main striker. In contrast to the usual practice, Scottish club Celtic wore numbers on their shorts rather than their shirts until 1975 for international matches, and until 1994 for domestic matches. The 1930s also saw great advancements in boot manufacture, with new synthetic materials and softer leathers becoming available. By 1936 players in Europe were wearing boots which weighed only a third of the weight of the rigid boots of a decade earlier, although British clubs did not adopt the new-style boots, with players such as Billy Wright openly pronouncing their disdain for the new footwear and claiming that it was more suited to ballet than football.|$|E

Yet, those people see themselves as hackers and even try to include the views of Raymond in {{what they see as a}} wider hacker culture, a view that Raymond has harshly rejected. Instead of a hacker/cracker dichotomy, they emphasize a spectrum of different categories, such as white hat, grey hat, black hat and script kiddie. In contrast to Raymond, they <b>usually</b> <b>reserve</b> the term cracker for more malicious activity.|$|R
