5|$|The {{majority}} of cases of cholangiocarcinoma present as inoperable (<b>unresectable)</b> disease in which case patients are generally treated with palliative chemotherapy, with or without radiotherapy. Chemotherapy {{has been shown in}} a randomized controlled trial to improve quality of life and extend survival in patients with inoperable cholangiocarcinoma. There is no single chemotherapy regimen which is universally used, and enrollment in clinical trials is often recommended when possible. Chemotherapy agents used to treat cholangiocarcinoma include 5-fluorouracil with leucovorin, gemcitabine as a single agent, or gemcitabine plus cisplatin, irinotecan, or capecitabine. A small pilot study suggested possible benefit from the tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib in patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma.|$|E
25|$|In November 2005, the FDA {{approved}} erlotinib {{in combination}} with gemcitabine for treatment of locally advanced, <b>unresectable,</b> or metastatic pancreatic cancer.|$|E
25|$|External {{irradiation}} may be {{used when}} the cancer is <b>unresectable,</b> when it recurs after resection, or to relieve pain from bone metastasis.|$|E
25|$|Likely, current chemotherapies are not effective. Antiprogestin {{agents have}} been used, but with {{variable}} results. A 2007 study of whether hydroxyurea {{has the capacity}} to shrink <b>unresectable</b> or recurrent meningiomas is being further evaluated.|$|E
25|$|The FDA first granted {{approval}} for advanced GIST patients in 2002. On 1 February 2012, imatinib was approved for use after the surgical removal of KIT-positive tumors {{to help prevent}} recurrence. The drug is also approved in <b>unresectable</b> KIT-positive GISTs.|$|E
25|$|Erlotinib {{has shown}} a {{survival}} benefit {{in the treatment of}} lung cancer in phase III trials. The SATURN (Sequential Tarceva in <b>Unresectable</b> NSCLC) study found that erlotinib added to chemotherapy improved overall survival by 19%, and improved progression-free survival (PFS) by 29%, when compared to chemotherapy alone.|$|E
25|$|Radiation {{therapy is}} often used after {{surgical}} resection for patients with locally or regionally advanced melanoma or for patients with <b>unresectable</b> distant metastases. Kilovoltage x-ray beams are often used for these treatments and have {{the property of the}} maximum radiation dose occurring close to the skin surface. It may reduce the rate of local recurrence but does not prolong survival. Radioimmunotherapy of metastatic melanoma is currently under investigation.|$|E
25|$|The FDA has {{approved}} imatinib {{for use in}} adults with relapsed or refractory Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL), myelodysplastic/ myeloproliferative diseases associated with platelet-derived growth factor receptor gene rearrangements, aggressive systemic mastocytosis without or an unknown D816V c-KIT mutation, hypereosinophilic syndrome and/or chronic eosinophilic leukemia who have the FIP1L1-PDGFRα fusion kinase (CHIC2 allele deletion) or FIP1L1-PDGFRα fusion kinase negative or unknown, <b>unresectable,</b> recurrent and/or metastatic dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. On 25 January 2013, Gleevec was approved for use in children with Ph+ ALL.|$|E
25|$|The usual {{outcome is}} poor, because only 10–20% of {{hepatocellular}} carcinomas {{can be removed}} completely using surgery. If the cancer cannot be completely removed, the disease is usually deadly within 3 to 6 months. This is partially due to late presentation with tumors, but also the lack of medical expertise and facilities in the regions with high HCC prevalence. However, survival can vary, and occasionally people will survive much longer than 6 months. The prognosis for metastatic or <b>unresectable</b> hepatocellular carcinoma has recently improved due to the approval of sorafenib (Nexavar®) for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.|$|E
25|$|Transcatheter {{arterial}} chemoembolization (TACE) {{is usually}} performed for <b>unresectable</b> tumors or {{as a temporary}} treatment while waiting for liver transplant. TACE is done by injecting an antineoplastic drug (e.g. cisplatin) mixed with a radio-opaque contrast (e.g. Lipiodol) and an embolic agent (e.g. Gelfoam) into the right or left hepatic artery via the groin artery. The goal of the procedure it to restrict the tumor’s vascular supply while supplying a targeted chemotherapeutic agent. TACE {{has been shown to}} increase survival and to downstage HCC in patients who exceed the Milan criteria for liver transplant. Patients who undergo the procedure may are followed with CT scans and may need additional TACE procedures if the tumor persists. As of 2005, multiple trials show objective tumor responses and slowed tumor progression but questionable survival benefit compared to supportive care; greatest benefit seen in people with preserved liver function, absence of vascular invasion, and smallest tumors. TACE is not suitable for big tumors (>8nbsp&cm), the presence of portal vein thrombus, tumors with a portal-systemic shunt, and patients with poor liver function.|$|E
25|$|Pharmacotherapy {{research}} for <b>unresectable</b> or metastatic malignant melanoma offers new treatment possibilities. In {{addition to the}} advances with recently approved agents, ongoing research into combination therapy, such as dabrafenib and trametinib, may reveal a more effective and better-tolerated option for patients with metastatic melanoma. One important pathway in melanin synthesis involves the transcription factor MITF. The MITF gene is highly conserved and is found in people, mice, birds, and even fish. MITF production is regulated via a fairly straightforward pathway. UV radiation causes increased expression of transcription factor p53 in keratinocytes, and p53 causes these cells to produce melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), which binds to melanocortin 1 receptors (MC1R) on melanocytes. Ligand-binding at MC1R receptors activates adenylate cyclases, which produce cAMP, which activates CREB, which promote MITF expression. The targets of MITF include p16 (a CDK inhibitor) and Bcl2, a gene essential to melanocyte survival. It {{is often difficult to}} design drugs that interfere with transcription factors, but perhaps new drugs will be discovered that can impede some reaction in the pathway upstream of MITF.|$|E
25|$|Cryoablation: Cryoablation is a {{technique}} used to destroy tissue using cold temperature. The tumor is not removed and the destroyed cancer is left to be reabsorbed by the body. Initial results in properly selected patients with <b>unresectable</b> liver tumors are equivalent to those of resection. Cryosurgery involves the placement of a stainless steel probe {{into the center of}} the tumor. Liquid nitrogen is circulated through the end of this device. The tumor and a half inch margin of normal liver are frozen to -190nbsp&°C for 15 minutes, which is lethal to all tissues. The area is thawed for 10 minutes and then re-frozen to -190nbsp&°C for another 15 minutes. After the tumor has thawed, the probe is removed, bleeding is controlled, and the procedure is complete. The patient will spend the first post-operative night in the intensive care unit and typically is discharged in 3 – 5 days. Proper selection of patients and attention to detail in performing the cryosurgical procedure are mandatory in order to achieve good results and outcomes. Frequently, cryosurgery is used in conjunction with liver resection as some of the tumors are removed while others are treated with cryosurgery.|$|E
500|$|Radiotherapy may {{form part}} of {{treatment}} to attempt to shrink a tumor to a resectable state, but its use on <b>unresectable</b> tumors remains controversial as there are conflicting results from clinical trials.
