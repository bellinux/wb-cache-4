[...] He {{also set up}} a field goal and another {{touchdown}} with runs of 32 and 39yards. [...] Bell was named the UPI's Midwest offensive {{player of the week}} for the effort. [...] When a reporter asked Bell for a comment, he said, [...] "Coach doesn't want <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> anything this week. [...] We've got to get ready for Ohio State." ...|$|E
500|$|In issue #121 (June 1973), the Green Goblin throws Gwen Stacy from a {{tower of}} either the Brooklyn Bridge (as {{depicted}} in the art) or the George Washington Bridge (as given in the text). She dies during Spider-Man's rescue attempt; {{a note on the}} letters page of issue #125 states: [...] "It saddens <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the whiplash effect she underwent when Spidey's webbing stopped her so suddenly was, in fact, what killed her." [...] The following issue, the Goblin appears to kill himself accidentally in the ensuing battle with Spider-Man.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after Xenogears was released, {{there was}} {{speculation}} of a sequel being released, although this never occurred. In 1999, Tanaka {{said that a}} project related to Xenogears was being developed. He also revealed that a sequel to Xenogears was initially planned, but never came to be. While Xenogears has never had an official sequel or prequel, there was wide speculation that Namco and Monolith Soft's Xenosaga was a prequel {{when it was first}} announced. Tetsuya Takahashi was the director and writer for both Xenogears and Xenosaga and has noted that [...] "with our relation between Square, I think it is difficult for <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it is a direct sequel or prequel". Approximately twenty members of the Xenosaga development staff had previously worked on Xenogears.|$|E

2500|$|... "Some other {{institutions}} {{need to give}} descriptive names to their bands in order to praise them. [...] The quality of the music, the precision of its drills, and the fine image that it portrays have made it unnecessary for <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> more than, 'This is the Auburn University Band.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|With {{no clear}} {{definition}} of the type, and few early illustrations or detailed descriptions to go by, {{the early history of}} the dory is muddled at best. The first known mention of a dory in detail was in 1719. Until about 1870, there are to be found no recorded dory lines, details, nor any list of particulars that would enable <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> with certainly what the earlier dories were really like." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{song on the}} album, [...] "Let God Be God", {{was written}} by Dan Dean in {{response}} to global instability. Dean stated that [...] "This is the perfect time for <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> Don't panic. God is in control. Jesus asks in Luke 12:25: Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life?" [...] One of the edgier songs the band has recorded, the song even has a James Brown scream, which Dean originally recorded to be funny, but it eventually stuck.|$|E

2500|$|Additional {{television}} commercials {{are expected to}} follow the Super Bowl spot, which are to demonstrate Switch's use cases among different demographics, as well as [...] "casual" [...] and [...] "core" [...] gaming audiences. Such ad venues included the 2017 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament, the 2017 Kids' Choice Awards, and on programming blocks for Nickelodeon, Adult Swim, and Comedy Central. Chavez emphasized that Nintendo's overall marketing for Switch would not be [...] "just a six to eight week launch campaign", but [...] "really a 15 month campaign for <b>us,</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> nothing of our plans for 2018".|$|E
2500|$|There are few {{records of}} Rasputin's parents. His father, Efim (sometimes spelled Yefim), was a peasant farmer and church elder {{who had been}} born in Pokrovskoye in 1842, and married Rasputin's mother, Anna Parshukova, in 1863. Efim also worked as a {{government}} courier, ferrying people and goods between Tobolsk and Tyumen The couple had seven other children, all of whom died in infancy and early childhood. There may have been a ninth child, Feodosiya. According to historian Joseph T. Fuhrmann, Rasputin was certainly close to Fyeodosiya and was godfather to her children, but [...] "the records that have survived do not permit <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> more than that." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{incident}} {{came to a}} {{close at}} 3:15a.m. on October 24, 2002, when Muhammad and Malvo were found sleeping in their car, a blue 1990 Chevrolet Caprice (which had been dismissed earlier in the investigation), at a rest stop off of Interstate 70 near Myersville, Maryland, and arrested on federal weapons charges. Police were tipped off by Whitney Donahue, who noticed the parked car. (Four hours earlier, Montgomery County police chief Charles Moose had relayed this cryptic message to the sniper: [...] "You have indicated that you want us to do and say certain things. [...] You have asked <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> 'We have caught the sniper like a duck in a noose.' We understand that hearing us say this is important to you". Moose asked the media [...] "to carry the message accurately and often." [...] This mysterious and arguable reference to a Cherokee fable has never been explained.) ...|$|E

2500|$|... "I {{was here}} once before when we bailed out Mexico with the NAFTA treaty. The peso was falling apart. I {{was down in}} Mexico doing shows, drug dealers and cartels everywhere, {{and we were going}} to lend them billions of dollars. [...] And I went to President Clinton myself and then Attorney General Janet Reno, and I said we need one thing. If we are going to bail Mexico out, let us make them sign an {{extradition}} treaty of fugitives, murders, criminals and get our kids back from Mexico. Right? Did not happen. What a perfect time for <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> we are going to save your entire country, we are going to lend you billions of dollars and shore up your economy, but you know what, since that meeting with President Clinton we now have on record over 3,000 murders and fugitives down there and we do not know how many kids".|$|E
2500|$|Voltairine de Cleyre was an anarchist without {{adjectives}} {{who initially}} identified {{herself as an}} individualist anarchist but later espoused a collectivist form of anarchism, while refusing to identify herself {{with any of the}} contemporary schools. ("The best thing ordinary workingmen or women could do was to organise their industry to get rid of money altogether [...] [...] [...] Let them produce together, co-operatively rather than as employer and employed; let them fraternise group by group, let each use what he needs of his own product, and deposit the rest in the storage-houses, and let those others who need goods have them as occasion arises.") She commented that [...] "Socialism and Communism both demand a degree of joint effort and administration which would beget more regulation than is wholly consistent with ideal Anarchism; Individualism and Mutualism, resting upon property, involve a development of the private policeman not at all compatible with my notion of freedom" [...] although she stopped short of denouncing these tendencies as un-anarchistic. ("There is nothing un-Anarchistic about any of [...] until the element of compulsion enters and obliges unwilling persons to remain in a community whose economic arrangements they do not agree to.") [...] Errico Malatesta was another proponent of anarchism without adjectives, stating that [...] "t is not right for <b>us,</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> the least, to fall into strife over mere hypotheses." ...|$|E
