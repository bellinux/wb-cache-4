I want to know what the teachers think characterizes concentration difficulties, the situations in which difficulties creates the most problems, and whether the teachers think that these difficulties solely depend on external factors.   To examine this, I chose to do interviews with three teachers in years four to six. I have completed parts of my work with my colleague Elin Preisz. We have used the same purpose and issues in our studies, although Elin has interviewed teachers in preschool. With this we want to be able to compare the reasoning between teachers at different stages in school.   The results of my study shows that the interviewees think that it is hard to describe what characterizes the problems in concentration difficulties because the problems is very individual. The interviewees, however, agree that the most problems occurs in situations without a clear structure. None of the interviewed teachers <b>belive</b> <b>that</b> it is possible to create a school environment were concentration difficulties do not exist, because they <b>belive</b> <b>that</b> the difficulties can be either inborn or a resultat of the environment.

Her expectations of marriage were those established by the model of her parents and grandparents.

While John Adams went to sit with the Continental Congress in Philadelphia, Abigail Adams was ready to take charge at home. Writing to her absent husband Abigail Adams recounted the battles that were sweeping the countyside. She described the apalling life conditions during the war.

These music descriptors are generated in two ways: as derivations and combinations of lower-level descriptors and as generalizations induced from manually annotated databases by the intensive application of machine learning.
