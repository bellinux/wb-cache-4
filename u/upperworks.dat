5|$|San Marcos {{was used}} for gunnery {{practice}} throughout World War II, although generally as an anchor for a canvas target screen. Sitting two to six {{feet below the surface}} and marked by an unlit buoy, she was responsible for the sinking of the cargo ship Lexington in 1940 following a collision. Tons of explosives were used to demolish her <b>upperworks</b> and drive her hull deep into the mud; by January 1959, they were successful and she remains there today.|$|E
5|$|Until the 20th century, naval weapons {{had a short}} range, so {{camouflage}} was unimportant for ships, and for the men {{on board}} them. Paint schemes were {{selected on the basis}} of ease of maintenance or aesthetics, typically buff <b>upperworks</b> (with polished brass fittings) and white or black hulls. Around the start of the 20th century, the increasing range of naval engagements, as demonstrated by the Battle of Tsushima, prompted the introduction of the first camouflage, in the form of some solid shade of gray overall, in the hope that ships would fade into the mist.|$|E
50|$|She and the {{squadron}} called at Batticaloa again from 9 to 23 August 1782 to be {{reinforced by the}} 74 gun Illustre and the 60 gun Saint-Michel and seventeen transports with troops and supplies. Héros was also placed on her side at Batticaloa to repair her hull, caulking and <b>upperwork.</b> Meanwhile, Suffren prepared an attempt to recapture Trincomalee, the main port on Sri Lanka. On 25 August, en route to Trincomalee, Héros had her stern and aftcastle lightly damaged in a collision with the Artésien. She {{was still able to}} take part in the French landings on 26 August which ended in the surrender of the British garrison on 31 August and the port's recapture.|$|R
5000|$|Cantique de Joie, Opus 70, was {{dedicated}} to Peter Basch and performed by him at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, on the V/153 Cavaillé-Coll (modified) in 1973. He wrote of his experience playing there: “The most exciting part for me was {{the entrance of the}} pedal triplets mid-way, like a pile driver pumping its way forward, a determined thrust and support to the <b>upperwork</b> that was crashing/exploding, aided by the dissonant chords cutting through the texture with a volcanic bombardment to the victorious final spread. And, that huge organ wrapped itself around me, like a tiger, and I will never, ever forget the entrance of the bombarde division when the console and tribune floor began to vibrate, making me think that I would bring down the entire balcony.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Methods of {{building}} construction {{are described in}} the Timberwork Manual, which, some say, was written by Yu Hao. (According to that book), buildings have three basic units of proportion, what is above the cross-beams follows the <b>Upperwork</b> Unit, what is above the ground floor follows the Middlework Unit, and everything below that (platforms, foundations, paving, etc.) follows the Lowerwork Unit. The length of the cross-beams will naturally govern the lengths of the uppermost cross-beams {{as well as the}} rafters, etc. Thus for a (main) cross-beam of (8 ft) length, an uppermost cross-beam of (3.5 ft) length will be needed. (The proportions are maintained) in larger and smaller halls. This (2/28) is the <b>Upperwork</b> Unit. Similarly, the dimensions of the foundations must match the dimensions of the columns to be used, as also those of the (side-) rafters, etc. For example, a column (11 ft) high will need a platform (4.5 ft) high. So also for all the other components, corbelled brackets, projecting rafters, other rafters, all have their fixed proportions. All these follow the Middlework Unit (2/24). Now below of ramps (and steps) there are three kinds, steep, easy-going, and intermediate. In places these gradients are based upon a unit derived from the imperial litters. Steep ramps are ramps for ascending which the leading and trailing bearers have to extend their arms fully down and up respectively (ratio 3/35). Easy-going ramps are those for which the leaders use elbow length and the trailers shoulder height (ratio 1/38); intermediate ones are negotiated by the leaders with downstretched arms and trailers at shoulder height (ratio 2/18). These are the Lowerwork Units. The book (of Yu Hao) had three chapters. But builders in recent years have become much more precise and skillful (yen shan) than formerly. Thus for some time past the old Timberwork Manual has fallen out of use. But (unfortunately) there is hardly anybody capable of writing a new one. To do that would be a masterpiece in itself! ...|$|R
5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Arkansas {{participated in}} Operation Magic Carpet, the {{repatriation}} of American servicemen from the Pacific. She took around 800 men back to the United States, departing on 23 September, and reaching Seattle, Washington on 15 October. She made another three Magic Carpet trips between Pearl Harbor and the continental United States to ferry more soldiers home. During the first months of 1946, Arkansas lay at San Francisco. In late April, the ship got underway for Hawaii. She reached Pearl Harbor on 8 May, and departed Pearl Harbor on 20 May, bound for Bikini Atoll, earmarked for use as target for atomic bomb testing in Operation Crossroads. On 1 July, Arkansas was exposed to an air burst in ABLE, but survived with extensive shock damage to her <b>upperworks,</b> while her hull and armored turrets were lightly damaged.|$|E
25|$|Renard {{arrived in}} Plymouth on 12 January 1799. She {{sat there for}} six months, finally {{undergoing}} fitting between July 1799 and January 1800. While undergoing fitting she may have received additional cannons and extensive <b>upperworks</b> to hold them. There is some question though whether she in fact received the additional armament and <b>upperworks</b> (see below). Commander Peter Spicer commissioned Renard in August 1799 for the Channel.|$|E
25|$|During the Second World War Wairuna {{continued}} in merchant {{service in the}} Pacific. In 1945 the Union Company sold her to the UK MoWT. The MoWT appointed J Denholm to manage her, and she served as a store ship on the River Clyde. On 5 August 1945 she was at Greenock when a fire destroyed much of her <b>upperworks.</b>|$|E
5000|$|While Skinner was {{an artistic}} and {{mechanical}} engineering genius, his business management skills were notoriously poor. In 1919, the Ernest M. Skinner & Company was reorganized with Arthur H. Marks (who had amassed a fortune {{as the former}} general manager and vice-president of the Goodrich Rubber Company) as the president and Skinner as vice-president of the newly organized Skinner Organ Company. This allowed Skinner {{to focus on the}} technical and artistic aspects of the dozens of projects in which the company was involved at any one time, while others would manage the commercial aspects of the company. In 1924, at the behest of Marks and William Zeuch, another principal at the factory, Skinner made his second trip to England, this time meeting with Henry Willis III, the grandson of [...] "Father" [...] Henry Willis (Sr.), and spending considerable time in France with Marcel Dupré learning about mutation stops and chorus work of the French Romantic organ. Skinner returned to the United States with a new love for unison and quint mixtures and more brilliant <b>upperwork</b> that was standard fare in English organs of the era.|$|R
50|$|George Fincham built a two-manual {{organ of}} 10 {{speaking}} stops for St Michael's Church in 1887. This was removed in 1892 and {{installed in the}} Chapel of St Peter at the Church of England Grammar School, Melbourne. The present organ, installed on the rear gallery in 1999 by Laurie Pipe Organs, was built by Samuel Lewis, an employee of George Fincham, who was his first apprentice {{as far back as}} 1864 and his first foreman, it is thought for the Dorcas Street Presbyterian Church in South Melbourne; it originally had two manuals and 17 speaking stops. It was installed at the Presbyterian Church, Denbigh Road, Armidale, in 1911 and in 1939 the mechanical action was converted to tubular-pneumatic by C.W. Andrewartha, who supplied a detached console. The casework with its carved transom rails, may also date from this time. The instrument was rebuilt in 1975 by Laurie Pipe Organs who converted the manual actions back to mechanical, electrified the pedal and stop actions, provided a new attached drawstop console, and supplied new Mixtures to the Great and Swell, a Trumpet 8 ft, and the pedal <b>upperwork.</b> In 2011 it was given a small overhaul by Darrell Pitchford. The front facade pipes were changed to silver and the stop mechanisms and pipes were cleaned and adjusted.|$|R
25|$|An amateur {{radio station}} is {{a radio station}} {{designed}} to provide radiocommunications in the amateur radio service for an amateur radio operator. Radio amateurs build and operate several types of amateur radio stations, including fixed ground stations, mobile stations, space stations, and temporary field stations. A slang term often used for an amateur station's location is the shack, named after the small enclosures added to the <b>upperworks</b> of naval ships to hold early radio equipment and batteries.|$|E
500|$|Enterprises wooden hull was remodeled {{shortly after}} she was laid down; she was given a plough-shaped ram bow and a {{semi-circular}} stern. The ship had only two decks: the main deck, {{very close to the}} ship's waterline, and the upper deck which carried her armament, about [...] above the waterline. She was the first ship of composite construction in the Royal Navy, with iron <b>upperworks.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Cheslakee {{was built}} in Ireland in 1910. [...] The ship was {{designed}} by A.T.C. Robertson, a Vancouver naval architect who had previously been employed with Bow, McLachlan & Co. [...] The hull, the maindeck and the crew's quarters were completed in Dublin by Dublin Dockyard Co. [...] The ship was then towed to Belfast, where a triple-expansion, compound steam engine was installed, generating 650 horsepower. [...] The engine was manufactured by MacColl & Co., and drove the vessel at a maximum speed of 11 to 12 knots. [...] No cabins or <b>upperworks</b> were installed in Belfast.|$|E
2500|$|Cheslakee {{departed}} Belfast on June 29, 1910 {{under the}} command of Capt. J.W. Starkey, who was a specialist in delivering new ships to their owners. [...] With the Panama Canal not yet complete, the voyage required travel around Cape Horn. [...] The ship first went to the island of St. Vincent, took on coal and water, then proceeded south to Montevideo. [...] Chesalakee then rounded South America, calling at Coronel, Chile and then at San Francisco, California. [...] The ship left San Francisco on September 20 and arrived in Vancouver, British Columbia on September 26, 1910. [...] With no <b>upperworks,</b> the ship looked like a tugboat on arrival.|$|E
2500|$|During one trip, Gazelle {{stood by}} as the sidewheeler Oregon, {{owned by the}} same company, was sinking after hitting a snag just below Salem. [...] Cargo from the Oregon was loaded onto Gazelle to lighten Oregon to better allow her salvaging. [...] Suddenly Oregon broke free of the snag, drifted downstream, ran up on a sandbar and sank so deeply that {{only a part of}} her <b>upperworks</b> were visible above the water. [...] Oregon, also a new steamer, was a total loss. [...] On the way back down, Gazelle ran over a log and broke some paddle buckets, which however was not serious damage, and in fact was one of the {{strengths}} of the paddlewheel design over the propeller on inland waters.|$|E
2500|$|The Union company sent Cheslakee to Wallace Shipyard in North Vancouver to have {{upper works}} {{constructed}} and generally prepare the vessel for operations. [...] Twenty-three first class cabins containing 56 berths were constructed, {{as well as}} a small lounge. [...] Afterwards the ship was licensed to carry 148 passengers in British Columbia coastal service. [...] Thirty persons could be seated in the dining salon, and the ship could carry 120 tons of cargo. [...] This was deemed sufficient for the route it was intended for, which was serving logging camps on the coast of British Columbia north as far as Kingcome Inlet. [...] While Cheslakee had handled well during the ocean journey, after the <b>upperworks</b> were added the ship took on a permanent list. [...] En route through Surge Narrows the ship heeled over so far the crew thought it might capsize.|$|E
2500|$|Rear-Admiral Sir William Symonds {{noted that}} after the ship's launch she was [...] "cut down" [...] and made a safe and fast ship. In {{the time of the}} Commonwealth of England all ships named after royalty were renamed; it was first decided to change the name of the ship into Commonwealth, but in 1650 it became a simple Sovereign. In 1651 she was again made more {{manoeuvrable}} by reducing <b>upperworks</b> after which she was described as [...] "a delicate frigate (I think the whole world hath not her like)". She served throughout the wars of the Commonwealth and became the flagship of General at Sea Robert Blake. She was involved in all of the great English naval conflicts fought against the United Provinces and France and was referred to as 'The Golden Devil' (den Gulden Duvel) by the Dutch.|$|E
2500|$|From 1938 to 1941, London {{received}} an altogether more comprehensive modernisation. Her <b>upperworks</b> were removed {{and replaced by}} new fore and aft superstructures and two upright funnels modelled on the contemporary [...] cruisers. The forward superstructure block incorporated a large hangar opening onto an athwartships catapult between the superstructure blocks. There was a catapult {{on either side of}} the after funnel. The 4-inch anti-aircraft guns were replaced by twin mountings and relocated to the after superstructure, with the torpedoes a deck below. The 2-pounder guns were carried on the hangar roof and the multiple Vickers guns mounted, one each, on the roofs of [...] "B" [...] and [...] "X" [...] turrets. A [...] belt, [...] deep, was added abreast the machinery spaces, extending up to the armoured deck. However, the hull had originally been carefully designed to reduce weight based on the initial arrangements. The modifications to London added heavy weights fore and aft and severely overstressed the hull. As a result cracks and loose rivets began to appear on the upper deck. The upper deck was reinforced, which caused the stress to be transmitted through the lower hull instead and cracks began to appear under the waterline. It took underwater reinforcements and refits extending into 1943 to remedy the situation.|$|E
60|$|A douche {{of spray}} blinded my brother for a moment. When {{his eyes were}} clear again he saw the monster had passed and was rushing landward. Big iron <b>upperworks</b> rose out of this headlong structure, and from that twin funnels {{projected}} and spat a smoking blast shot with fire. It was the torpedo ram, Thunder Child, steaming headlong, coming {{to the rescue of}} the threatened shipping.|$|E
60|$|Some of the {{passengers}} were of opinion that this firing came from Shoeburyness, until it was noticed that it was growing louder. At the same time, far away in the southeast the masts and <b>upperworks</b> of three ironclads rose {{one after the other}} out of the sea, beneath clouds of black smoke. But my brother's attention speedily reverted to the distant firing in the south. He fancied he saw a column of smoke rising out of the distant grey haze.|$|E
60|$|Then suddenly, as we {{approached}} Kew, came {{a number of people}} running, and the <b>upperworks</b> of a Martian fighting-machine loomed in sight over the housetops, not a hundred yards away from us. We stood aghast at our danger, and had the Martian looked down we must immediately have perished. We were so terrified that we dared not go on, but turned aside and hid in a shed in a garden. There the curate crouched, weeping silently, and refusing to stir again.|$|E
60|$|The {{first attempt}} {{was made in the}} early years of the eighteenth century, but that {{lighthouse}} did not last long. The second was made by Rudyerd, and was very well made and strong, but its <b>upperworks</b> were made of timber, and the whole thing was destroyed by fire, after having shown a light for over a third of a century. There was an amusing episode during the construction of the Rudyerd lighthouse when a French warship took all the construction workers prisoner, and made off with them to France. Luckily Louis, the King of France, heard of this and was quite incensed, ordering the British prisoners to be released and treated as hospitably as possible, while the captain of the warship was to be cast into the prison.|$|E

50|$|They were {{considered}} the most successful British frigate design of the period, much prized by the Navy Board; after the prototype was launched in 1804 (by which time four more frigates had already been ordered to the same design), a further eleven sister-ships were ordered to her design, although this was slightly modified (in 1805) to have the gangways between forecastle and quarterdeck more integrated into the <b>upperworks,</b> a step towards the final enclosure of the waist. This was reinforced in 1809 by the abandonment of breastworks at the break of the quarterdeck and forecastle and in 1810 by the narrowing of the waist {{by the addition of}} gratings inboard of the gangways. At the same date, 'top riders', angled reinforcing timbers for the <b>upperworks,</b> were discontinued.|$|E
50|$|At 06:09 on {{the morning}} of 18 October, Tennessee, with her fire-support unit, entered the channel between Homonhon and Dinagat islands.

5000|$|As of 2014, {{there are}} over 100 vessels {{operated}} by Serco Marine Services. Since the disbandment of the Royal Maritime Auxiliary Service, all vessels carry the ship prefix SD, and {{continue to do so}} since Denholm's share was bought out by Serco in late 2009. Vessels currently in service can be recognised by their black hulls with white beading and white-coloured <b>upperworks.</b> The former buff-coloured <b>upperworks</b> which had once been associated with the RMAS are steadily disappearing with the last few vessels due to adopt the new colour scheme in coming years. [...] Marine Services enables Royal Navy and Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships, including the United Kingdoms Strategic Nuclear Deterrent, to either move in or out of port for operational deployment and training exercises around the world.
