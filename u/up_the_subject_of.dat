5|$|In {{regards to}} {{bringing}} in P.A.Works as the animation studio, Toba had taken {{notice of the}} company from back when they provided in-between animation and production assistance for Fullmetal Alchemist (2003–4) and Darker than Black (2007), respectively; Aniplex helped produce both series. After watching just the first three episodes of P.A.Works' True Tears (2008), however, he was shocked at the high quality and immediately went to P.A.Works' studio in Toyama Prefecture {{to meet with the}} production staff in the hope that one day Aniplex could collaborate with them on a project together. The following week, Maeda brought <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> deciding on an animation studio for Angel Beats! and mentioned that he too had seen True Tears and had become interested in P.A.Works. Shortly after that, Toba formally made the proposal to P.A.Works to animate the project.|$|E
5|$|Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) asks Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) if he {{can work}} {{part-time}} so he can go to Philadelphia to help with his sports marketing job. David Wallace says {{that he might be}} needed in the office if there is a crisis with one of his clients, to which he responds that Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) and Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) have agreed to cover for him, though he in fact has not asked them yet. Stanley and Phyllis respond with their usual disinterest in helping others, so Jim offers to treat them to lunch. Stanley and Phyllis order extra side dishes and help themselves to an excess of wine, annoying Jim with drunken behavior and silencing him whenever he brings <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> their covering for him. When they arrive back at the office, a drunk Stanley and Phyllis are seemingly passed out in the backseat of Jim's car. When Jim puts his coat on them to keep them warm, Phyllis and Stanley say they will cover for him as they care for Jim and his family, laughing as they reveal they were only pranking him. Jim gives both of them a hug.|$|E

25|$|By 2003 {{there was}} a {{gathering}} momentum behind the possibility of Yudhoyono being a presidential candidate. The United Democratic Nationhood Party (PPDK) {{was the first to}} bring <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> nomination. In September 2003, Yudhoyono's own party began to make preparations in case Yudhoyono was willing to accept a presidential nomination. The Democratic Party then initiated a publicity campaign to promote Yudhoyono as a candidate. For his part, Yudhoyono was not responsive both to PPDK or the Democratic Party's manoeuvrings to nominate him and continued his duties as Minister. PPDK was disappointed in Yudhoyono's reaction and the Democratic Party continued to wait for Yudhoyono to resign his position as was expected of all presidential candidates apart from the incumbent President and Vice-President.|$|E

When the United States' military involvement in World War II picked <b>up,</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>of</b> a great deal of records evolved, with musicians promoting what was seen as American values and also providing support for fighting against the Axis Powers.

2500|$|George Peacock's {{theory of}} algebra was much {{improved}} by D. F.

This new theory of algebra as the science of symbols and of their laws of combination was carried to its logical issue by De Morgan; and his doctrine on the subject is still followed by English algebraists in general. Thus George Chrystal founds his Textbook of Algebra on De Morgan's theory; although an attentive reader may remark that he practically abandons it when he takes <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> infinite series.

Christie was shown in a picture talking with local mayors in a lineup, including Sokolich, after a news conference in Teaneck on December 8, 2011. In 2012, Sokolich and his cousins were given a personal tour of the 9/11 Memorial Plaza by Wildstein, who repeatedly told Sokolich, [...] "I've been told to be nice to you." [...] Matt Mowers, regional political director for Christie's re-election campaign, who had previously worked in the governor's intergovernmental affairs office, met with Sokolich regularly in 2013 and told him about other Democrats who endorsed Christie for governor.

Sokolich eventually supported Barbara Buono, Christie's Democratic opponent in the 2013 election.

Smailey begins to lecture Ruth on morality and the imperinence of her [...] "imposture". Ruth interrupts him, having recognised him as the [...] "psalm-singing villain" [...] who had caused her fall. Smailey tries to backtrack and begins to expose all the tangled ways that he has justified his own behaviour while condemning others. Ruth, a bit exasperated, still forgives him, as she hopes to be forgiven. Smailey is shocked that someone like her would dare to adopt such a tone with him, and begins to attack Mrs. Van Brugh again.
