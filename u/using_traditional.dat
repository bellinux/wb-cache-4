5|$|In Buah Rindu, Amir {{shows an}} {{affinity}} for <b>using</b> <b>traditional</b> Malay poetic forms such as the quatrain, but unlike the highly fixed traditional forms, he mixes the rhyming patterns. The text is dominated by terms related to love and searching, and according to Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw the collection is united by a theme of longing. Johns states that the imagery in Buah Rindu is dependent on traditional Malay literature, and that Amir's terminology is heavily influenced by classical Malay poetry. The author's use of language is also notably coloured by Javanese terms and ideas, and another source of influence appears to be Indian literature, with references to Hindu gods and goddesses.|$|E
5|$|In Buah Rindu, {{particularly}} {{its earlier}} poems, Amir shows {{an affinity for}} <b>using</b> <b>traditional</b> Malay poetic forms such as the quatrain (found in pantun and syair). However, unlike the highly fixed traditional forms, Amir mixes the rhyming patterns; for instance, one quatrain may have a monorhyme (seloka) while the next may have an alternating simple 4-line (pantun) pattern. Lines are generally divided by a clear caesura, {{and in some cases}} even two. The caesura may not always be in the centre of a line; it is at times towards the front, and at times towards the rear.|$|E

5|$|Arbroath smokies, {{for which}} Arbroath is {{well-known}} nationally and internationally, are made solely in Arbroath following the award of Protected Geographical Indication in 2004, which limits Arbroath smokie production to within 4km of Arbroath. Smokies {{are made from}} haddock <b>using</b> <b>traditional</b> methods {{dating back to the}} late 19th century where the fish are first salted overnight to preserve them, before being left tied in pairs to dry. Next, the dried fish are hung in a special barrel containing a hardwood fire and covered with a lid. After around an hour of smoking, the fish are golden brown and ready to eat. The preparation of smokies remains a cottage industry in Arbroath, centred almost exclusively at the harbour area. However, one larger processor, RR Spink, supplied Arbroath smokies to several UK supermarket chains. It appears that, nowadays, the firm concentrates on smoking other fish such as salmon or trout and no longer supplies the Arbroath Smokie. The company holds the Royal Warrant as a fishmonger to the Queen.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the three}} {{compounds}} built within the rova by successive Merina rulers bears distinct architectural styles that reflect the dramatic changes experienced in Imerina over {{the reign of the}} 19th century Kingdom of Madagascar, which saw the arrival and rapid expansion of European influence at the royal court. The site contains a blend of traditional Merina and European styles and construction methods. The predominant architectural features and layout of the royal city follow the traditional model of rova construction that predominated in the Highlands from the 15th century. Following tradition, the homes of the living are constructed of wood and vegetation (living materials), while the tombs of the dead are built in stone (cold, inert material). The selection of specific wood and plant materials used in construction, each of which were imbued with distinct symbolic meaning, reflected traditional social norms and spiritual beliefs. Since 1996, many of the buildings have undergone restoration <b>using</b> <b>traditional</b> materials and construction practices appropriate to the era in which the buildings were first erected.|$|E
5|$|Following its predecessors, Brawl uses {{a battle}} system {{unlike that of}} typical {{fighting}} games. Players can choose from a large selection of characters, each attempting to knock their opponents off the screen as they fight on various stages. The characters in Brawl include most of the same ones as the predecessors, such as the well-known Mario and Pikachu. Instead of <b>using</b> <b>traditional</b> health bars that start at a maximum value and lose value, Brawl characters start the game with 0%; the value rises as they take damage and may rise over 100% {{to a maximum of}} 999%. As a character's percentage increases, the character flies further back when hit. When a character is knocked beyond a stage's boundary and disappears from the screen, the character loses either a life, a point, or coins, depending on the mode of play. Brawl includes a function which allows players to create profiles with personalized button configurations for each control method along with their chosen username.|$|E

5|$|Given the inaccessibility {{of much of}} the species' range, {{particularly}} the central Amazon, estimating jaguar numbers is difficult. Researchers typically focus on particular bioregions, thus species-wide analysis is scant. In 1991, 600–1,000 (the highest total) were estimated to be living in Belize. A year earlier, 125–180 jaguars were estimated to be living in Mexico's 4,000-km2 (2400-mi2) Calakmul Biosphere Reserve, with another 350 in the state of Chiapas. The adjoining Maya Biosphere Reserve in Guatemala, with an area measuring 15,000km2 (9,000mi2), may have 465–550 animals. Work employing GPS telemetry in 2003 and 2004 found densities of only six to seven jaguars per 100km2 in the critical Pantanal region, compared with 10 to 11 <b>using</b> <b>traditional</b> methods; this suggests the widely used sampling methods may inflate the actual numbers of cats.|$|E
5|$|Nineteenth and {{twentieth century}} avant-garde artistic {{movements}} {{took an interest}} in the typographical arts, greatly enriching book design and illustration. In the late nineteenth century, William Morris founded the Arts and Crafts movement, which emphasized the value of traditional craft skills that seemed to be disappearing in the mass industrial age. His designs, like the work of the Pre-Raphaelite painters with whom he was associated, referred frequently to medieval motifs. In 1891 he founded the Kelmscott Press, which by the time it closed in 1898 had produced over fifty works <b>using</b> <b>traditional</b> printing methods, a hand-driven press and hand-made paper. They included his masterpiece, an edition of the Works of Geoffrey Chaucer with illustrations by Edward Burne-Jones. Morris also invented three distinctive typefaces - Golden, Troy, and Chaucer, with the text being framed with intricate floral borders similar to illuminated medieval manuscripts. His work inspired many small private presses in the following century.|$|E
5|$|Perkin-Elmer {{intended}} to use custom-built and extremely sophisticated computer-controlled polishing machines to grind the mirror to the required shape.

(The team of Kodak and Itek also bid on the original mirror polishing work.

Economic explanations for an individual’s <b>use</b> of <b>traditional</b> instead of modern medicines are scarce and {{often fail to}} consider explanations beyond the conventional. This paper puts forward an economic explanation for the <b>use</b> of <b>traditional</b> medicine. First, traditional medicines were the default form of health care available in pre-colonial times where industry influence was yet to develop. Hence, both those individuals who exhibit lower incomes and are left out of health insurance coverage {{are more likely to}} <b>use</b> <b>traditional</b> medicines. Second, cultural attitudes and ethnic group controls explain variation in utilisation, even among those who have health insurance. Results are suggestive of the validity of cultural interpretations...|$|R
