5|$|McGann {{was cast}} as Walter Golic to appear with Ralph Brown, his co-star in Withnail and I. Alien 3 Assembly Cut expands on Golic's part in Alien 3, with Golic persuading Morse to <b>unstrap</b> {{him in the}} {{infirmary}} when he hears that the Alien has been trapped. He knocks Morse out, goes to the containment chamber containing the Alien, kills Arthur (who is guarding the door) and releases the creature—which promptly kills him. In an August 1992 Elle magazine article, McGann said that Golic intends to release the Alien {{in the hope that}} he can collaborate with it to kill the humans on Fury 161. Alien 3 editor Terry Rawlings said in the 2003 special-edition DVD release of the Alien Anthology that a parallel exists between Golic and Renfield in Dracula; both are deranged lunatics, who fall under the influence of a paranormal entity which they try to appease.|$|E
25|$|Another {{advance in}} dinghy sailing was {{introduced}} in the 1930s, when the technique of trapezing was introduced. This involves using the crew to provide more leverage (than possible by hiking out) to keep the sails vertical and the boat balanced, doing this can prevent the boat from capsizing, by hanging outside the boat on a harness and rope attached to the 'hounds' or upper mast. As a result, the boat is easier to keep upright, and the sails can deliver maximum power most of the time. While trapezing can be helpful and increase speed, it can also be very dangerous if the crew is not wearing a quick release harness or is inexperienced. The quick release harness allows the crew to <b>unstrap</b> themselves quickly so as to not get forced under the boat if it were to capsize.|$|E
2500|$|... 10 December 2004: Captain Miles Selby {{died in a}} midair {{collision}} {{during training}} near Mossbank, Saskatchewan while practising the co-loop manoeuvre. The other pilot, Captain Chuck Mallett, was thrown from his destroyed aircraft while still strapped into his seat. While tumbling towards the ground, {{he was able to}} <b>unstrap,</b> deploy his parachute and land with only minor injuries.|$|E

2500|$|The song is {{also the}} basis of a {{tradition}} practised among Australians for decades. Whenever the song is played at an event or a public bar, those present (particularly the males) congregate together on the dance floor where they <b>unstrap</b> their belts and hobble around singing the song with their trousers around their ankles. Australians have been known to request the song in bars while travelling abroad for the purpose of locating fellow countrymen. Ross Wilson of Daddy Cool, although perplexed about the origin of the practice has observed,'… I suppose it's got the silliness {{that was part of the}} charm of Daddy Cool.' ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{helicopter}} crew lowered {{a line to}} survivors to tow them to shore. First {{to receive}} the line was Bert Hamilton, who was treading water about ten feet from the plane's floating tail. The pilot pulled him across the ice to shore while avoiding {{the sides of the}} bridge. By then some fire/rescue personnel had arrived to join the military personnel and civilians who pulled Hamilton (and the next/last three survivors) from the water's edge up to waiting ambulances. The helicopter returned to the aircraft's tail, and this time Arland D. Williams Jr. (sometimes referred to as [...] "the sixth passenger") caught the line. Williams, not able to <b>unstrap</b> himself from the wreckage, passed the line to flight attendant Kelly Duncan, who was towed to shore. On its third trip back to the wreckage, the helicopter lowered two lifelines, fearing that the remaining survivors had only a few minutes before succumbing to hypothermia. Williams, still strapped into the wreckage, passed one line to Joe Stiley, who was holding on to a panic-stricken and blinded (from jet fuel) Priscilla Tirado, who had lost her husband and baby. Stiley's co-worker, Nikki Felch, took the second line. As the helicopter pulled the three through the water and blocks of ice toward shore, both Tirado and Felch lost their grip and fell back into the water.|$|E
60|$|EDSTASTON. How {{is a man}} to {{remember}} anything when he is trussed up in this ridiculous fashion? I can hardly breathe. [He makes a futile struggle to free himself.] Here: don't be unkind, your Majesty: tell these fellows to <b>unstrap</b> me. You know you really owe me an apology.|$|E

60|$|So {{he looked}} about till {{he found his}} trunk, and, leading Jennie there, he took his station {{by the side of}} it, and {{immediately}} proceeded to <b>unstrap</b> and unlock it. He took out some of the largest things {{from the top of the}} trunk and put them on a settee near, so that the officer could easily examine the rest. By the time he had done this, an officer was ready.|$|E

60|$|Attracted by {{the call}} from Fred and the loud whistle given by Andy, the old lumberman had noted {{that a number of}} {{visitors}} were {{standing in front of the}} two cabins at the upper end of Snowshoe Island. He was still a considerable distance out on the lake, but his rapid skate strokes soon brought him to the shore. Then, without waiting to <b>unstrap</b> his skates, he came forward through the snow, his shotgun ready for use.|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the electromyographic (EMG) activity level of two back muscles and two lower limb muscles during a leg holding exercise in strapped (supported) and <b>unstrapped</b> positions. The strapped position is usually used in clinical situations while the <b>unstrapped</b> position is commonly adopted by the patient in the home environment. Muscle activity of the longissimus thoracis, multifidus, gluteus maximus and biceps femoris muscles of 15 healthy young males was recorded by surface electrodes. During the leg holding exercise in the strapped position, normalized EMG activity of longissimus thoracis (64 %) and multifidus (71 %) were shown to be higher than that of gluteus maximus (39 %) and biceps femoris (47 %). Similarly, higher activity of longissimus thoracis (66 %) and multifidus (67 %) than that of gluteus maximus (43 %) and biceps femoris (46 %) was found in <b>unstrapped</b> position. No significant differences were demonstrated in the activity of the back and lower limb muscles between strapped and <b>unstrapped</b> positions. The present study may suggest that more training effect will be expected for back muscles than for lower limb muscles when using leg holding as a training exercise. The leg holding exercise using hands for stabilization (common in home environment) may be regarded as effective as the exercise stabilized with straps (common in clinical situations).

60|$|Two {{black and}} white chamber-maids appeared. Aaron {{found himself in a}} blue silk bedroom, and a footman <b>unstrapping</b> his bag, which he did not want <b>unstrapped.</b> Next minute he was beckoned and allured by the Italian {{servants}} down the corridor, and presented to the handsome, spacious bathroom, which was warm and creamy-coloured and glittering with massive silver and mysterious with up-to-date conveniences. There he was left to his own devices, and felt like a small boy finding out how it works. For even the mere turning on of the taps was a problem in silver mechanics.|$|R

60|$|He had his {{knapsack}} {{before him}} on the table, and he smiled rather grimly {{as he began to}} <b>unstrap</b> it. Paynter looked on with polite expressions of interest, but was considerably surprised when the artist unpacked and placed on the table, not any recognizable works of art, even of the most Cubist description, but (first) a quire of foolscap closely written with notes in black and red ink, and (second), to the American's extreme amazement, the old woodman's ax with the linen wrapper, which he had himself found in the well long ago.|$|E
6000|$|He {{bent down}} and began to <b>unstrap</b> {{something}} from his bicycle. It was something that had puzzled his companion {{all the way in}} spite of what held him to more interesting riddles; it appeared to be several lengths of pole strapped together and wrapped up in paper. Fisher took it under his arm and began to pick his way across the turf. The ground was growing more tumbled and irregular and he was walking toward a mass of thickets and small woods; night grew darker every moment. [...] "We must not talk any more," [...] said Fisher. [...] "I shall whisper to you when you are to halt. Don't try to follow me then, for it will only spoil the show; one man can barely crawl safely to the spot, and two would certainly be caught." ...|$|E

Perhaps he had just dismounted on his return from the mine; he was English enough to disregard the hottest hours of the day. Basilio, in a livery of white linen and a red sash, had squatted for a moment behind his heels to <b>unstrap</b> the heavy, blunt spurs in the patio; and then the Senor Administrator would go up the staircase into the gallery. Rows of plants in pots, ranged on the balustrade between the pilasters of the arches, screened the corredor with their leaves and flowers from the quadrangle below, whose paved space is the true hearthstone of a South American house, where the quiet hours of domestic life are marked by the shifting {{of light and shadow}} on the flagstones.|$|E
60|$|It {{would be}} {{difficult}} to paint the general disappointment at this sudden collapse of the experiment. A united groan burst from the party, including the patient, for it at once became apparent that a man with a wooden leg--to say nothing of two--could only walk on a hard beaten path, and as there were few such in the island, Rosco's chance of a long ramble seemed to vanish. But Zeppa and his son were not men to be easily beaten. They set to work to construct feet for the legs, which should be broad enough to support their friend on softish ground, and these were so arranged with a sort of ball-and-socket joint, that the feet could be moved up and down. In theory this worked admirably; in practice it failed, for after a staggering step or two, the toes having been once raised refused to go down, and thus was produced the curious effect of a man stumping about on his heels! To overcome this difficulty the heels of the feet were made to project almost as much behind as the toes did in front somewhat after the pattern of Ebony's pedal arrangements, as Rosco remarked when they were being fitted on for another trial. At last, by dint of perseverance, the wooden legs were perfected, and Rosco re-acquired the art of walking to such perfection, that he was to be seen, almost at all times and in all weathers, stumping about the village, his chief difficulty being that when he chanced to fall, which he often did, he was obliged either to get some one to help him up, or to crawl home; for, being unable to get his knees to the ground when the legs were on, he was obliged to <b>unstrap</b> them if no one was within hail.|$|E

Now, Minnie, the door's shut; Hilda heavily descends to the basement; you <b>unstrap</b> the straps of your basket, lay on the bed a meagre nightgown, stand side by side furred felt slippers. The looking-glass--no, you avoid the looking-glass. Some methodical disposition of hat-pins. Perhaps the shell box has something in it? You shake it; it's the pearl stud there was last year--that's all. And then the sniff, the sigh, the sitting by the window. Three o'clock on a December afternoon; the rain drizzling; one light low in the skylight of a drapery emporium; another high in a servant's bedroom--this one goes out. That gives her nothing to look at. A moment's blankness--then, what are you thinking? (Let me peep across at her opposite; she's asleep or pretending it; so what would she think about sitting at the window at three o'clock in the afternoon? Health, money, hills, her God?) Yes, sitting on {{the very edge of the}} chair looking over the roofs of Eastbourne, Minnie Marsh prays to God. That's all very well; and she may rub the pane too, as though to see God better; but what God does she see? Who's the God of Minnie Marsh, the God of the back streets of Eastbourne, the God of three o'clock in the afternoon? I, too, see roofs, I see sky; but, oh, dear--this seeing of Gods! More like President Kruger than Prince Albert--that's the best I can do for him; and I see him on a chair, in a black frock-coat, not so very high up either; I can manage a cloud or two for him to sit on; and then his hand trailing in the cloud holds a rod, a truncheon is it?--black, thick, thorned--a brutal old bully--Minnie's God! Did he send the itch and the patch and the twitch? Is that why she prays? What she rubs on the window is the stain of sin. Oh, she committed some crime! ...|$|E
40|$|The {{protocol}} for estimating force of contraction by triceps surae (TS) muscles requires the immobilization of the ankle during dorsiflexion and plantar flexion. However, large {{variability in the}} results has been observed. To identify {{the cause of this}} variability, experiments were conducted where ankle dorsiflexion force and electromyogram (EMG) of the TS were recorded under two conditions: (i) toes were strapped and (ii) toes were <b>unstrapped,</b> with all other conditions such as immobilization of the ankle remaining unchanged. The root mean square (RMS) of the EMG and the force were analyzed and one-tail Student&# 039;s t-test was performed for significance between the two conditions. The RMS of the EMG from TS muscles was found to be significantly higher (~ 55 %) during dorsiflexion with toes <b>unstrapped</b> compared with when the toes were strapped. The torque corresponding to dorsiflexion was also higher with toes <b>unstrapped.</b> Our study has shown {{that it is important to}} strap the toes when measuring the torque at the ankle and EMG of the TS muscle...|$|R
