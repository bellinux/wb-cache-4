25|$|On {{the night}} of 23–24 July there was {{violence}} in the protesting. By the end of July 2013, anti-government protesters were still out in force protesting peacefully in Sofia with Reuters recording 24 July 2013 as the 41st straight day of peaceful protests. The protesters were demanding {{the resignation of the}} Socialist-led government of Oresharski. More than 100 lawmakers, ministers, and journalists spent the night barricaded inside Parliament before police removed them. MPs attempted to leave Parliament by boarding a white coach bus and making their way through the crowd. There was violence as the police tried to unsuccessfully clear the way for the bus, and after slowly making its way around the Aleksandar Nevski cathedral, the bus returned to the back exit of Parliament after about an hour around midnight. Another police action at around 4 am forcefully cleared the remaining protesters, and the coach left, which led to further accusations of police violence in the ensuing days. A survey covering the attitudes of Bulgarians showed that 65% felt that the actions of the protesters on that day were out of line, while 53% also disapproved of the police response. 79% agreed that the provocateurs involved in the violence need to have charges levelled against them. Sociologists expressed mixed views in relation to the events. One policeman has been charged for <b>unlawful</b> <b>conduct</b> with regard to his actions during the siege of Parliament and is currently on trial for disproportionate use of force against protesters.|$|E

500|$|The reduced armed {{resistance}} {{prompted the}} Indonesian government in 1988 {{to open up}} East Timor to improve its commercial prospects, including a lifting of the travel ban on journalists. The new policy came from foreign minister Ali Alatas {{against the advice of}} the military leadership who feared it would lead to loss of control. Alatas and diplomats swayed Suharto of the policy as a response to international concerns. In late 1989, hardline military commander Brigadier General Mulyadi was replaced by Brigadier General Rudolph Warouw who promised a more [...] "persuasive" [...] approach to anti-integrationists. Restrictions on travel within the territory were reduced, groups of political prisoners were released, and the use of torture in interrogation became less common. Warouw attempted to increase military discipline; in February 1990 an Indonesian soldier was prosecuted for <b>unlawful</b> <b>conduct</b> in East Timor, the first such action since the invasion.|$|E
500|$|In 1717, Diego de los Reyes Balmaseda became {{governor}} of Paraguay. [...] He purchased the position from the Spanish authorities, {{a practice that}} had spread at the time. [...] Reyes was a merchant who had made his fortune trading exporting yerba mate from Paraguay and importing various cheap and needed manufactures back to Paraguay, so he was seen as qualified for the post by the Spanish Crown. [...] Reyes was an open admirer of the Jesuits. [...] Two of his wife's uncles {{were members of the}} Jesuit order, and several of his most important advisors were Jesuits. [...] His policies were also seen by the settlers as pro-Jesuit. [...] Reyes' Jesuit advisors instigated him to order an attack on the Payaguá Indians of the Chaco despite a tenuous truce established three years earlier in 1717; all of the captured Payaguás were remitted to the Jesuits for conversion to Christianity and mission life. [...] The settlers received none of the captives for the encomienda, although it had been the settler militia that risked their lives fighting the Payaguás and colonial trade and outlying farms would now be threatened by retaliatory Payaguá raids. [...] The Payaguás, who lived in the Gran Chaco, were considerably less likely to threaten the Jesuits, with their missions farther to the east of the civil province of Paraguya. [...] Reyes acquired a reputation for enriching himself using the powers of his office to control trade. [...] Reyes also taxed important members of the Paraguayan elite to fund the construction of defensive fortifications. [...] The end result was that Reyes was a deeply unpopular governor who found the majority of the cabildo of Asunción actively seeking his removal. [...] In a bid to keep his position, Reyes accused his chief antagonists of treason and had them imprisoned. [...] The notables of Asunción complained to the Real Audiencia of Charcas, accusing Reyes both of imprisoning the cabildo members without good cause, as well as general <b>unlawful</b> <b>conduct</b> as governor.|$|E

He was, however, found not guilty of three other charges: gross sexual imposition, sexual battery and a fifth count of <b>unlawful</b> sexual <b>conduct</b> with a minor.

2500|$|Some {{historians and}} governments hold Japanese {{military}} forces, namely the Imperial Japanese Army, the Imperial Japanese Navy, and the Imperial Japanese family, especially under Emperor Hirohito, {{responsible for the}} deaths of millions, some estimate between 3 and 14 million civilians and prisoners of war through massacre, human experimentation, starvation, and forced labor that was either directly perpetrated or condoned by the Japanese military and government. Some Japanese soldiers have admitted to committing these crimes. Airmen of the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service and Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service were not included as war criminals because there was no positive or specific customary international humanitarian law that prohibited the <b>unlawful</b> <b>conduct</b> of aerial warfare either before or during World War II. The Imperial Japanese Army Air Service took part in conducting chemical and biological attacks on enemy nationals during the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II and the use of such weapons in warfare were generally prohibited by international agreements signed by Japan, including the Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907), which banned the use of [...] "poison or poisoned weapons" [...] in warfare.|$|E

2500|$|Since Article Three of the United States Constitution {{stipulates}} that federal courts may only entertain [...] "cases" [...] or [...] "controversies", the Supreme Court cannot decide {{cases that are}} moot {{and it does not}} render advisory opinions, as the supreme courts of some states may do. For example, in DeFunis v. Odegaard, , the Court dismissed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a law school affirmative action policy because the plaintiff student had graduated since he began the lawsuit, and a decision from the Court on his claim {{would not be able to}} redress any injury he had suffered. However, the Court recognizes some circumstances where it is appropriate to hear a case that is seemingly moot. If an issue is [...] "capable of repetition yet evading review", the Court will address it even though the party before the Court would not himself be made whole by a favorable result. In Roe v. Wade, , and other abortion cases, the Court addresses the merits of claims pressed by pregnant women seeking abortions even if they are no longer pregnant because it takes longer than the typical human gestation period to appeal a case through the lower courts to the Supreme Court. Another mootness exception is voluntary cessation of <b>unlawful</b> <b>conduct,</b> in which the Court considers the probability of recurrence and plaintiff's need for relief.|$|E
2500|$|During the Seven Years' War (1756–1763), {{also known}} as the French and Indian War in the colonies, the marines were then {{appropriately}} dispersed amongst the Royal navy warships, the Royal Marines played an integral part in successful naval expeditions. These ship detachments soon formed expeditionary battalions that fought ashore Canada, Cuba, and the Philippines. Now being strictly {{under the control of the}} Admiralty, the Marines were used exclusively for expeditions and raids, becoming so essential to the maritime strategy of Prime Minister William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. Their primary mission in ship-to-ship combat and ship seizures were to pick off officers with expert musketry, to repel borders with skilled bayonetry, and to augment as gun crew members when necessary. Also, they played a major part of a ships landing party for operations ashore, raiding naval bases, stores, etc, etc. But during cruising conditions, the marines policed and enforced ship regulations about fires, thievery, and <b>unlawful</b> <b>conduct</b> by sailors, to include prevention and deterrence against a mutinous crew. By the end of the war, the Corps of Royal Marines remained an important force within the Royal Navy. On the eve of the American War of Independence, roughly 4,500 marine officers and enlistees were still in existence.
