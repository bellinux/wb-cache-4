50|$|Traffic from an <b>Uplink</b> <b>port</b> to an Isolated port will {{be denied}} {{if it is}} in the Isolated VLAN. Traffic from an <b>Uplink</b> <b>port</b> to an {{isolated}} port will be permitted {{if it is in}} the primary VLAN.|$|R
5000|$|The switch {{forwards}} {{all frames}} received {{from a private}} <b>port</b> to the <b>uplink</b> <b>port,</b> regardless of VLAN ID or destination MAC address. Frames received from an <b>uplink</b> <b>port</b> are forwarded in the normal way (i.e. to the port hosting the destination MAC address, or to all ports of the VLAN for broadcast frames or for unknown destination MAC addresses). As a result, direct peer-to-peer traffic between peers through the switch is blocked, and any such communication must go through the uplink. While private VLANs provide isolation between peers at the data link layer, communication at higher layers may still be possible depending on further network configuration.|$|R

50|$|Arista Networks {{introduced}} the 7500E switch (with up to 96 100GbE ports) in April 2013. In July 2014, Arista {{introduced the}} 7280E switch (the world's first top-of-rack switch with 100G <b>uplink</b> <b>ports).</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Cisco Catalyst 1900 is a 19" [...] rack mountable, managed (configurable) 10baseT Ethernet switch with 100baseTX/100baseFX <b>uplink</b> <b>ports.</b> This {{product was}} popular in small office {{networks}} {{because of its}} features and price.|$|E
50|$|Example scenario: {{a switch}} with VLAN 100, {{converted}} into a Private VLAN with one P-Port, two I-Ports in Isolated VLAN 101 (Secondary) and two community VLANs 102 and 103 (Secondary), with 2 ports in each. The switch has one <b>uplink</b> <b>port</b> (trunk), connected to another switch. The diagram shows this configuration graphically.|$|R
50|$|A {{high-density}} FTTE design {{might use}} commonly available 24- or 48-port switches (these switches are configured with one 1 Gbit/s <b>uplink</b> <b>port</b> per twelve 100BASE-TX user ports). This relatively high work area-to-backbone port ratio provides better performance than is typically provided to enterprise users. Both low and high-density FTTE architectures provide excellent performance {{in terms of}} bandwidth delivered to the work area.|$|R
40|$|An uplink {{synchronization}} method and a terminal. The {{implementation of the}} terminal is as follows: if the terminal is a support terminal, the terminal comprises: an information obtaining unit (504), used for obtaining an access identification of a beneficial terminal and obtaining an <b>uplink</b> <b>port</b> number used by the support terminal for sending a reference signal; a reference signal sending unit (501), used for sending the reference signal on an <b>uplink</b> <b>port</b> to an access device by using the access identification of the beneficial device; an adjustment value reception unit (502), used for receiving an adjustment value of uplink synchronization information from the access device; and a synchronization unit (503), used for performing uplink synchronization according to the adjustment value received by the adjustment value reception unit, of the uplink synchronization information. The support terminal sends a reference signal by using an access identification of the beneficial terminal, and receives an adjustment value of synchronization information of the support terminal, thereby implementing uplink synchronization. The support terminal {{does not need to}} access a network, thereby avoiding interference of the support terminal to another terminal and the beneficial terminal on an access device side, and saving a preamble signal resource...|$|R
50|$|The N1500 {{offers a}} low budget step in model {{compared}} to the N2000. The N1500 doesn't have dedicated (back-side) stacking-ports but you can convert 10G ethernet <b>uplink</b> <b>ports</b> to stacking-ports and stack multiple N1500's together.|$|E
5000|$|VSP 4850GTS, a 1RU Layer 2/Layer 3 Switch that is {{equipped}} with 48 x 10/100/1000BASE-T ports (including two common <b>Uplink</b> <b>ports</b> offering SFP connectivity) plus 2 x 10 Gigabit Ethernet ports that feature SFP+ physical connectivity.|$|E
50|$|Following the S25 and S50 {{are several}} types as S55 and S60, also {{offering}} 1 Gbit/s access ports and 10 Gbit/s <b>uplink</b> <b>ports,</b> where each model has a speciality, such as low latency or deep data-buffers (S60).|$|E
5000|$|Many modern Ethernet host {{adapters}} can automatically detect another computer {{connected with}} a straight-through cable and then automatically introduce the required crossover, if needed; if neither of the adapters has this capability, then a crossover cable is required. Most newer switches have automatic crossover ("auto MDI-X" [...] or [...] "auto-uplink") on all <b>ports,</b> eliminating the <b>uplink</b> <b>port</b> and the MDI/MDI-X switch, and allowing all connections to be made with straight-through cables. If both devices being connected support 1000BASE-T according to the standards, they will connect regardless of whether a straight-through or crossover cable is used.|$|R
5000|$|... 1700: 24 10BaseT ports, 1 {{switchable}} MDI/MDIX <b>uplink</b> 10baseT/AUI/BNC <b>port,</b> and 2 Fast Ethernet ports. Runs neither CatOS nor IOS. Is a first-generation carryover from Cisco's {{acquisition of}} Grand Junction Networks.|$|R
30|$|Using a {{top down}} approach, {{the amount of}} {{bandwidth}} (maximum) needed for a twenty node THUNDER lab can be described. If we assume that each client device requires a sustained 1 Mbps network throughput, {{we would need to}} accommodate for sustaining 20 Mbps within the network switch used by the clients. Since the network switch is isolated to communicating with the resources of THUNDER, this throughput needs to be sustainable on the <b>uplink</b> <b>port.</b> This is relatively easy, given the costs of gigabit switches on the market today. The specification that needs close attention is the total bandwidth of the switch backplane. Making the assumption that this bandwidth is the number of ports multiplied by the switch speed is not always true. In our case, the bandwidth needed, 20 Mbps, is much lower than the maximum throughput of a twenty-four port gigabit switch.|$|R
50|$|It is {{only when}} the VLAN port group is to extend to another device that tagging is used. Since {{communications}} between ports on two different switches travel via the <b>uplink</b> <b>ports</b> of each switch involved, every VLAN containing such ports must also contain the uplink port of each switch involved, and traffic through these ports must be tagged.|$|E
50|$|The ERS 2526T and ERS 2526T-PWR models offer 24 {{ports of}} 10/100 plus two Gigabit <b>uplink</b> <b>ports</b> {{that are a}} combo {{configuration}} of 1000BASE-T/SFP. The ERS 2526T-PWR model offers PoE support on half of the user ports. When staking eight ERS 2526T models it will provide 192 ports of copper 10/100BASE-T, and with the ERS 2526T-PWR models 96 of the ports will support PoE and up to 16 ports of 1000BASE-X Small form-factor pluggable transceivers. The system also {{has the ability to}} stack any combination of these Switches (up to 8 switches) in a system.|$|E
5000|$|The ERS 2550T {{supports}} 48 {{ports of}} 10/100 plus two Gigabit <b>uplink</b> <b>ports</b> {{that are a}} combo configuration of 1000BASE-T/SFP. The ERS 2550T-PWR supports PoE capabilities on half of the user ports. System scaling is accomplished by stacking eight ERS 2550T-PWR systems together to provide up to 384 ports of copper 10/100BASE-T and with the ERS 2550T-PWR models, 192 of the ports will support Power-over-Ethernet (all the ports with the red border around them will support PoE - see the adjacent picture) and up to 16 ports of 1000BASE-X Small form-factor pluggable transceivers.|$|E
50|$|Introduced in 1998, {{this made}} the {{distinction}} between <b>uplink</b> and normal <b>ports</b> and manual selector switches on older hubs and switches obsolete. If {{one or both of}} two connected devices has the automatic MDI/MDI-X configuration feature, {{there is no need for}} crossover cables.|$|R
50|$|Among {{the more}} {{advanced}} features of FTTO switches are precise link diagnostics (on the <b>uplinks</b> and TP <b>ports),</b> programmable function contacts, hardened management against hacking attacks, intelligent power budget management, easy reboot with memory cards, and extended durability. Many products have a {{mean time between failures}} (MTBF) of over 60 years (based on Siemens calculation procedure) and interoperability certificates with the leading manufacturers of core equipment (i.e. Cisco, HP, Alcatel).|$|R
50|$|Dell Force10 {{also offers}} a FTOS based blade switch: Force10 MXL 10/40 Gbit/s switch for their M1000e blade enclosure, {{available}} since {{the second half of}} 2012. The MXL switch is a S4810 switch in chassis form-factor offering 32 internal 10Gbit/s 10GBASE-KR ports, 2 external 40Gbit/s (<b>uplink</b> or stack) <b>ports</b> and 2 expansion slots for 2 ports QSFP+ 40Gbit/s ports or 4 port 10Gbit/s SFP+ or 10GBaseT copper <b>ports</b> for <b>uplinks</b> or stacking.|$|R
5000|$|The Juniper EX2200-C is a compact, affordable, {{and energy}} {{efficient}} switch in a 1 U high and 10.8 inch wide formfactor. The EX2200-C {{does not have}} dual redundant power supplies nor does it have fans and instead the small unit stays cool with a heat sink that sits {{on the back of}} the unit. Even the PoE version is fanless. The EX2200-C is a small 19" [...] rack mountable (using optional brackets) or desktop switch with 12 gigabit ports with a choice of PoE or non-PoE. The switch also has 2 SFP <b>uplink</b> <b>ports</b> for virtual chassis (stacking), link aggregation or as uplinks to aggregation switches. The EX2200-C has a data rate of 28 Gbit/s.|$|E
50|$|Nodes {{can have}} {{two types of}} ports: MDI (uplink port) or MDI-X (regular port, 'X' for {{internal}} crossover). Hubs and switches have regular ports. Routers, servers and end hosts (e.g. personal computers) have <b>uplink</b> <b>ports.</b> When two nodes having {{the same type of}} ports need to be connected, a crossover cable is often required at speeds of 10 or 100 Mbit/s, else connecting nodes having different type of ports (i.e. MDI to MDI-X and vice versa) requires straight-through cable. Thus connecting an end host to a hub or switch requires a straight-through cable. On switches/hubs sometimes a button is provided to allow a port to act as either a normal (regular) or an uplink port, i.e. using MDI-X or MDI pinout respectively.|$|E
50|$|The N2000 is an Ethernet switch {{with limited}} IP capabilities. There are two 'sizes': 24 x 1GbaseT or 48 x 1GBaseT ports {{and each of}} them {{available}} as POE+ or standard switch. All models in the N20xx series can be stacked with other models in the same series. Although they do use same stacking-cables as the N3000 series it is NOT possible to stack N2000 with N3000 switches. All models come with 2 x 10Gbase SFP+ <b>uplink</b> <b>ports</b> and two 'twentigig' stacking ports at the back. Management can be done by assigning IP address to switch or one of the vlan-interfaces. The N2000 is marketed as the follow-up for the legacy PowerConnect 5500 models as well as the Force10 S25 and S50 models.|$|E
5000|$|IntelliJack - In-the-wall switch {{with four}} Gigabit ports facing {{outwards}} and one additional Gigabit <b>port</b> <b>uplink.</b> Also the units have two [...] "passthrough ports" [...] {{that take an}} [...] "inside connection" [...] and provides a port {{on the outside of}} the unit. Can be powered locally or with downstream PoE power. If powered by PoE+ of a compatible HP switch, then up to two outside ports can pass IEEE 802.1af power to attached devices.|$|R
50|$|The {{technology}} {{behind the}} latest Virtual Connect FlexFabric adapters and modules, {{part of the}} HP FlexNetwork Architecture, takes Virtual Connect further with unique capabilities. Virtual Connect FlexFabric provides up to four physical functions for each blade server adapter network port, with the unique ability to fine-tune bandwidth to adapt to virtual server workload demands on the fly. All four connections can have their hardware personalities defined by the System Administrator as FlexNICs to support only Ethernet traffic as before with Virtual Connect. In addition however, one of the physical functions can also {{be defined as a}} FlexHBA for Fibre Channel protocol support or an iSCSI initiator for iSCSI boot protocol support. Each function has 100 percent hardware-level performance and provides the I/O performance needed {{to take full advantage of}} multi-core processors and to support more virtual machines per physical server.Each server can support many connections—up to 24 per half-height blade—with less investment in expensive adapter cards on the server, fewer interconnect modules in the blade enclosure and fewer expensive <b>uplink</b> switch <b>ports</b> in the corporate network.Virtual Connect as one of the technology foundations for HP CloudSystem and Converged Infrastructure allows the abstraction of the blade server infrastructure from the LAN and SAN infrastructure. This allows resources to be allocated to services in a dynamic Cloud Environment.|$|R
50|$|The top {{of range}} {{switches}} are the S4810 (fiber) or S4820 (copper) with 48 x 10Gbit/s SFP+ (S4810) or 10GBASE-T (S4820) and 4 QSFP+ 40Gbit/s <b>uplink</b> <b>ports.</b> The S4800 series are marketed as distribution switches for both datacenter as campus networks for large networks or (collapsed) core switches for smaller networks. The S4800 series switches can be stacked using either 10Gbit/s or 40Gbit/s ports using fiber links or copper/twinax based direct attached ports. The pass-through latency ranges from 800 nano seconds for the S4810 to 3,3 micro seconds for the copper based S4820. The S4810, S4820 and the MXL or M-I/O swithces use the Broadcom Trident+ ASIC. This {{is the same}} ASIC as used in the Dell PowerConnect 8100 series but running the FTOS operating system, while the PowerConnect 8100 series runs a Broadcom built firmware.|$|E
50|$|The N3000 is hardware-wise pretty {{similar to}} the N2000 series but the OS offers {{advanced}} IP capabilities (including routing protocols like RIP, OSPF, PBR etc.). Besides the 4 model choices as in N2000 (24 or 48 ports, with or without POE+) {{there is also the}} N3024F which offers 24 x SFP 1G ports.Unlike the N2000 series the N3000 has 'combo-ports': All 'copper' based switches offer 2 SFP 1Gb fiber ports (to be used instead of the two higherst numbered RJ45 1GBaseT port) and the N3024F offers two 1 GbaseT RJ45 combo ports (interface 23 and 24). All N3000 series switches also offer two SFP+ 10Gb <b>uplink</b> <b>ports.</b> Optional you can add a module for another two SFP+ ports or two 10GBaseT RJ45 ports. Stacking can be done via the built-in 'twentygig' ports and for management you can use an out-of-band 1G Ethernet management port. The N3000 series is the follow-up for the legacy PowerConnect 6200 and 7000 series as well as the Force10 S50/S55 switches.|$|E
40|$|To {{construct}} a large commodity clustec a hierarchical network is generally adopted for connecting the host muchines, where a Gigabit backbone switch connects a few commodity switches with uplinks to achieve scaled bisectional bandwidth. This type of interconnection usually results in link contention and has congestion {{developed at the}} <b>uplink</b> <b>ports.</b> Moreover, the non-detenninistic delays on scheduling communication events in clusters accelerate the building up of congestion amongst these <b>uplink</b> <b>ports,</b> which lead to severe packets drop and hinder the overall performance. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} practical design of high-speed complete exchange algorithm on a commodity cluster interconnected by a hierarchical Ethemet-based network. By exploiting some architectural characteristics of the interconnection in optimizing the performunce of a complete exchange algorithm, we introduce a congestion control mechanism - global windowing that monitors and regulates the trafic load, together with a permutation scheme - reorder scheme that effectively alleviates the congestion problem. We evaluate our algorithm and compare its performance with other algorithms in a PC cluster connected by various types of switches, including Gigabit Ethernet, input-buffered and shared-memory Fast Ethernet switches. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
