2500|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{objections}} to the idea of purpose trusts being valid. Firstly, English trusts law requires there be certainty of what the trust's goal is; most purpose trusts are for vaguely worded requests, such as the [...] "maintenance of good relations between nations [...] the preservation of the independence of newspapers" [...] found in Re Astor. Secondly, there is a general principle that there must be ascertainable beneficiaries. This is because, as said in Morice, [...] "Every trust (other than a charitable one) must have a definite object. There must be somebody, in whose favour the court can decree performance". If there are no beneficiaries, nobody can enforce the trust in the event that the trustees fail to carry out their duties. The third objection is that of perpetuity; a trust cannot exist for all time. The standard rule is that no trust can be drafted so that any interest lasts for longer than the life of the beneficiary, plus 21 years. In addition, no trust can be found valid if its interests last longer than this period. Purpose trusts, without beneficiaries, would cause <b>unnecessary</b> <b>confusion</b> if found valid because there is no marker by which to measure its existence. Purpose trusts may also be held to be invalid as a matter of public policy, where the courts conclude that the purpose is [...] "eccentric or capricious and the court regards it as useless".|$|E

Fresh T 6 (Whittingham's) medium is being used weekly for this purpose in our laboratory and subjected to a 5 % CO 2 -in-air system 24 hours prior to use. Experiments were designed to determine whether two-cell embryos obtained from an F 1 (CBA x C 57 /B 1 / 6) x F 1 cross were superior to the easily obtainable CBA x ICR cross. The aim was to get a 90 % blastocyst result {{for use as a}} quality control. Eight experiments were performed over a 6 -week period. The CBA two-cell embryos were compared with the F 1 group under identical conditions. A total of 177 two-cell embryos were obtained from the CBA group and 214 two-cell embryos from the F 1 group. In the CBA group 51 developed to the blastocyst stage (28. 8 %) compared with 187 in the F 1 group (87, 4 %) (P< 0. 0001).

40|$|This chapter {{reviews the}} {{evidence}} for a second attention disorder that is distinct from yet overlaps with ADHD. Although this condition has been called Sluggish Cognitive Tempo (SCT) since the 1980 s, I have recently recommended that the name be changed to Concentration Deficit Disorder (CDD) for various reasons, {{not the least of}} which is that it can be viewed by the public as pejorative, derogatory, or frankly offensive (Barkley, 2014; Saxbe & Barkley, 2014). While some prior reviewers of the evidence have suggested that the disorder be called attention deficit disorder, or ADD (Diamond, 2005; Milich & Roberts, 2012), and many clinicians have adopted this term for people who are primarily inattentive and have little or no evidence of hyperactive or impulsive behavior, it is not advisable to do so. Not the least reason for which is that ADD is the older term for ADHD dating back to DSM-III in 1980 and so resurrecting it as the name for a second attention disorder merely <b>unnecessary</b> creates <b>confusion</b> between these conditions which, as will be shown below, are quite different in a number of important features.

40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen the {{development}} of a large literature on balance sheet factors in emerging-market financial crises. In this paper we discuss three concepts widely used in this literature. Two of them original sin' and debt intolerance' seek to explain the same phenomenon, namely, the volatility of emerging-market economies and the difficulty these countries have in servicing and repaying their debts. The debt-intolerance school traces the problem to institutional weaknesses of emerging-market economies that lead to weak and unreliable policies, while the original-sin school traces the problem instead to the structure of global portfolios and international financial markets. The literature on currency mismatches, in contrast, is concerned with the consequences of these problems and with how they are managed by the macroeconomic and financial authorities. Thus, the hypotheses and problems to which these three terms refer are analytically distinct. The tendency to use them synonymously has been an <b>unnecessary</b> source of <b>confusion.</b> ...|$|R

Under present law in many states, the absolute assignment of rents is the only means by which lenders can create an effective security interest in rents of mortgaged property. An absolute assignment of rents purports to transfer title to rents to the mortgage lender although in substance it creates a security interest in rents. The Article explores the historical development of the absolute assignment of rents and discusses the <b>confusion,</b> <b>unnecessary</b> litigation, and even injustice that it causes under state law and in bankruptcy. The National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws has recently approved the new Uniform Assignment of Rents Act, which removes the necessity for absolute assignments of rents by creating a workable and comprehensive scheme for the creation of security interests in rents.
