5|$|Benchley {{filled in}} for P. G. Wodehouse at Vanity Fair at the {{beginning}} of 1916, reviewing theatre in New York. This inspired staff at the Tribune magazine to creativity for articles (such as arranging for the producers of The Thirteenth Chair to cast Benchley as a corpse), but the situation at the magazine deteriorated as the pacifist Benchley became <b>unhappy</b> with the Tribunes position on World War I, and the Tribune editors were <b>unhappy</b> with the evolving tone and irreverence of the magazine. In 1917, the Tribune shut down the magazine, and Benchley was out of work again. When a rumored opening for an editorial position at Vanity Fair fell through, Benchley decided he would continue freelancing, having {{made a name for himself}} at the magazine.|$|E

40|$|Zimbabwians even {{happier than}} South Afric ans” {{was in a}} {{headline}} {{on the front page}} of a major South Afric an newspaper in June 2012 2. The article reported an international study according to which So uth Africans were the <b>unhappiest</b> people in the world and even <b>unhappier</b> than people in Zi mbabwe. Several other South African newspapers reported in the same vein. This news report strikes as strange. How can South Africans be the least happy, while the standard of living is the highest in Africa? And why do so many Zimbabwians seek a better life in South Africa if that country is such a sink of unhappiness? So there seems to be something wrong with this information...|$|R

5|$|In 1173 Henry {{faced the}} Great Revolt, an {{uprising}} by his eldest sons and rebellious barons, supported by France, Scotland and Flanders. A number of grievances underpinned the revolt. Young Henry was <b>unhappy</b> that, despite {{the title of}} king, in practice he made no real decisions and was kept chronically short of money by Henry. Young Henry had also been very attached to Thomas Becket, his former tutor, and may have held his father responsible for Becket's death. Geoffrey faced similar difficulties; Duke Conan of Brittany had died in 1171, but Geoffrey and Constance were still unmarried, leaving Geoffrey in limbo without his own lands. Richard was encouraged to join the revolt as well by Eleanor, whose relationship with Henry, as previously described, had disintegrated. Meanwhile, local barons <b>unhappy</b> with Henry's rule saw opportunities to recover traditional powers and influence by allying themselves with his sons.|$|E
5|$|In 1656 {{relations}} between Rupert and Charles Louis deteriorated badly. Rupert {{had fallen in}} love with Louise von Degenfeld, one of his sister-in-law's maids of honour. One of Rupert's notes proffering his affections accidentally fell into the possession of Charles Louis' wife Charlotte, who believed it was written to her. Charlotte was keen to engage in an affair with Rupert and became <b>unhappy</b> when she was declined and the mistake explained. Unfortunately, von Degenfeld was uninterested in Rupert, but was engaged in an affair with Charles Louis—this was discovered in due course, leading to the annulment of the marriage. Rupert, for his part, was <b>unhappy</b> that Charles Louis could not endow him with a suitable estate, and the two parted on bad terms in 1657, Rupert refusing to ever return to the Palatinate again and taking up employment under Ferdinand III in Hungary.|$|E
