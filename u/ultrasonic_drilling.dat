40|$|Abstract. A drill {{processing}} for {{the difficult}} to cut material such as ceramics, hardened steel, glass and heat-resistant steel is widely requested {{in the industrial}} world. Furthermore the drilling process {{becomes more and more}} difficult in the case of that the requested hole diameter is less than one millimeter.

However, it is often difficult with this configuration to avoid coupling of unwanted bending modes, low responsiveness, and loss of ultrasonic energy due to boundaries between tuned components.

40|$|A {{miniature}} CHEMIN XRD/XRF (X-Ray Diffraction/X-Ray Fluourescence) {{instrument is}} currently being developed for definitive mineralogic analysis of soils and rocks on Mars. One of the technical issues {{that must be addressed}} in order to enable XRD analysis on an extraterrestrial body is how best to obtain a representative sample powder for analysis. For XRD powder diffraction analyses, it is beneficial to have a fine-grained sample to reduce preferred orientation effects and to provide a statistically significant number of crystallites to the X-ray beam. Although a 2 -dimensional detector as used in the CHEMIN instrument will produce good results with poorly prepared powders, the quality of the data will improve if the sample is fine-grained and randomly oriented. An Ultrasonic/Sonic Driller/Corer (USDC) currently being developed at JPL is an effective mechanism of sampling rock to produce cores and powdered cuttings. It requires low axial load (< 5 N) and thus offers significant advantages for operation from lightweight platforms and in low gravity environments. The USDC is lightweight (< 0. 5 kg), and can be driven at low power (< 5 W) using duty cycling. It consists of an actuator with a piezoelectric stack, ultrasonic horn, free-mass, and drill bit. The stack is driven with a 20 kHz AC voltage at resonance. The strain generated by the piezoelectric is amplified by the horn by a factor of up to 10 times the displacement amplitude. The tip impacts the free-mass and drives it into the drill bit in a hammering action. The free-mass rebounds to interact with the horn tip leading to a cyclic rebound at frequencies in the range of 60 - 1000 Hz.

40|$|In-situ {{sampling}} and analysis {{is one of the}} major tasks in future NASA exploration missions. It is essential that the samples acquired on other planets including Mars are free of contaminations from the earth. Recently, a novel drilling technology that is actuated by a piezoelectric drive mechanism was developed and it is called Ultrasonic/Sonic Driller/Corer (USDC). This drill has an inherent capability to extract the formed drilling powder and thus addresses the critical issue of contamination. A modification of this USDC in the form of an Ultrasonic Rock Abrasion Tool (URAT) allows for the formation of pristine rock surface for analysis. An algorithm is being proposed for the reduction of the contamination that may be generated during the acquisition of the samples. The algorithm could be used to control the flow of particles using programmed vibration characteristics and thus allows for smart flow of particles. The hypothesis is that the probability of a contamination left on the ground surface is exponentially inverse-proportional to the volume of the core ground into dusts. To support this hypothesis, we need to understand the flow pattern of the particles. A model proposed by Savage [1988] is used to develop a computer program using finite difference method.

The entrance chipping morphologies, produced with and without ultrasonic, were observed and evaluated with respect to the fracture mechanics of brittle material. Giving consideration to the variation characteristics of the plastic deformation region in the interior material induced by the specific kinematics principles of the abrasive, the ultrasonic effects on the chipping formation mechanisms were investigated by assessing the groove morphologies obtained in the scratching experiment utilizing the formation mechanisms of the lateral cracking. Furthermore, the formal confirmatory tests with and without ultrasonic were performed to validate these chipping formation mechanisms. It was found that the plastic deformed region reached its maximum at the trajectory bottom. Moreover, the propagation of the lateral cracking initially nucleated {{at the bottom of the}} ductile deformation zone resulted in the formation of the entrance chipping in formal RUD process. The slight deformation of the material at the two terminals of each groove produced with ultrasonic would provide the inhibitory effects to the further extending of the lateral cracks, which would shrink with the increased spindle speed, and the inhibitory effect dominated in determining the improvement effects on the hole entrance quality.

The RPUD’s percussive system is composed of a percussive horn, a free mass, and a drill tool. The percussive horn enlarges longitudinal vibration from piezoelectric stack and delivers the vibration to the drill tool through the free mass, which forms the percussive motion.

Drilling and planetary soil/rock sample acquisition provides information about history of past events, minerals and chemical composition of the soil/rock of the planetary body, available resources for future manned missions and the mechanical behavior of the planetary soil/rock. Several types of drilling devices have been proposed for lunar, Mars, and planetary subsurface exploration. However, these devices have limitations (e. g. heavy equipment and need for large axial force) {{that need to be}} addressed in order to be feasible for extraterrestrial bodies’ exploration. A special type of <b>ultrasonic</b> percussive <b>drill</b> have been proposed by Honeybee Spacecraft Mechanisms Corporation and NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to address the limitations of current drilling devices. In this study, the mechanical system of the <b>ultrasonic</b> percussive <b>drill</b> and its interaction with the supporting medium is studied. The percussive mechanism consists of an ultrasonic horn, a free mass, and the drill rod. Special attention is given to the impact between the free mass and the drill rod, including the effects of structural damping, the supporting medium of the rod, plastic deformation in the contact area, and repeated impacts of the free mass on the drill rod. A general methodology to analyze the impact of the free mass on the drill rod, analogous to the longitudinal impact of a mass on a rod, is developed. The methodology involves uncoupling the nonlinear problem by determining the response of each body independently under the contact force to find the local indentation, then using Hertz force-indentation relation to find the contact force. This method is applied using mode superposition method and finite element technique for various support conditions of the rod (e. g. rigid, elastic, free, viscoelastic). Additionally, a model to account for drill rod penetration into the supporting medium due to impact of the free mass is also presented. It was found that for an undamped rod, the support condition of the rod does not affect the contact force if the contact ends before the arrival of the reflected wave to the point of contact. It was also observed that the contact force due to impact, for a given support condition, increases with increasing damping of the rod. Moreover, a modified Hertz equation is introduced to include plastic deformation on the rod due to impact of the free mass. The study was performed for identical repetitive impacts and it was found that the largest plastic deformation occurs in the first impact, with additional plastic deformation decreasing with the increasing number of impacts. The dynamic response of the overall percussive drill was investigated with a finite element model, including the interaction of the free mass with the ultrasonic horn and the drill rod. A numerical example indicated that the dynamic response of the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>drill</b> is directly affected by the supporting medium.
