We perform free energy simulations of <b>urea</b> <b>solutions</b> in different <b>urea</b> concentrations using two urea models (OPLS and KBFF models) to calculate and decompose the activity coefficients. For the case of urea, we clarify the concept of the ideal solution in different concentration scales and standard states and its effect on our subsequent analysis. The analytical form of activity coefficients depends on the concentration units and standard states. For both models studied, urea displays a weak concentration dependence for excess chemical potential. However, for the OPLS force-field model, this results from contributions that are independent of concentration to the van der Waals and electrostatic components whereas for the KBFF model those components are nontrivial but oppose each other. The strong ideality of <b>urea</b> <b>solutions</b> in some concentration scales (incidentally implying a lack of water perturbation) is discussed in terms of recent data and ideas on the mechanism of urea denaturation of proteins...|$|R

50|$|An iso-osmolar {{solution}} can be hypotonic if the solute is able {{to penetrate}} the cell membrane.

The osmolarity of normal saline, 9 grams NaCl dissolved in water to a total volume of one liter, is a close approximation to the osmolarity of NaCl in blood (about 290 mOsm/L). Thus, normal saline is almost isotonic to blood plasma. Neither sodium nor chloride ions can freely pass through the plasma membrane, unlike urea.|$|E

In 2010, most light-duty diesel manufacturers in the U.S. added catalytic systems to their vehicles to meet new federal emissions requirements. There are two techniques that have been developed for the catalytic reduction of NOx emissions under lean exhaust conditions: selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and the lean NOx trap or NOx adsorber. Instead of precious metal-containing NOx absorbers, most manufacturers selected base-metal SCR systems that use a reagent such as ammonia to reduce the NOx into nitrogen. Ammonia is supplied to the catalyst system by the injection of urea into the exhaust, which then undergoes thermal decomposition and hydrolysis into ammonia.

Several reduced human myeloma proteins, when subjected to starch gel electrophoresis, yielded individual patterns that nevertheless had features in common with those of reduced normal γ-globulins. Reduction of normal and abnormal γ-globulins was accompanied by the appearance of titratable sulfhydryl groups.

However, the exact rela-tion between alterations in water and electro-lyte levels and changes in central nervous sys-tem (CNS) excitability is still not completely clear. While investigating the effect of hyper-tonic urea solutions on brain water content, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, and urea uptake by the cerebral cortex (Reed and Woodbury, 1962 a,b), we observed that ne-phrectomized rats which had received urea, 2 g/kg intraperitoneally (i. p.) as a 50 % solution, appeared to be less susceptible to spontaneous seizures than were control nephrectomized rats. About this time, Carter (1962) reported his favorable experience with the use of hyper-tonic <b>urea</b> <b>solution</b> in the treatment of status epilepticus. In view of the foregoing and the fact that hypertonic <b>urea</b> <b>solution</b> has been used clinically to reduce brain volume and CSF pressure, the work reported here was under-taken in an attempt to establish the effect of hypertonic <b>urea</b> <b>solution</b> on CNS excitability and to study the relation between CNS excita-bility, brain water content, and brain electro-h’te concentrations. METHODS. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, initial body weight 150 to 175 g, were used as experi-mental animals. Water and food were available ad libitnno throughout the experiments.
