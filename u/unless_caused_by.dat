Our {{understanding of the}} gene network as a self-regulating system allows us to model these disorders and correct them using undamaged regulatory links. Data collection and analysis preceding modelling are more convenient to perform using specially designed databases with visualization facility. Results: The TRRD database stores formalized data on transcription regulation of 19 genes of the thyroid system. The data about the function of gene network regulating the thyroid system are stored in formal state in GeneNet database. A logic analysis of the gene network of the thyroid system was performed in order to detect the key regulatory links for subsequent mathematical modelling...|$|E

30|$|There are no {{pathognomonic}} features {{predicting a}} LMS on any imaging technique [29, 30, 36]. Rapid increase in size (within 3  months) {{has been reported}} in case reports of LMS [48, 59] but is generally not distinctive as it may occur in fibroids as well [22]. No growth—in 3  months—may be reassuring <b>unless</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> GnRH [65, 66]. Not only can the uterine sarcoma be accompanied by fibroids responding to GnRH, but it may also be sensitive for estrogen deprivation itself due to its estrogen receptors. It {{has been reported in}} a group of 21 uterine sarcomas that all but one (95  %) was either solitary or in case of several myometrial lesions the largest [64]. Another study with ultrasound compared eight LMS and three STUMPs with 225 fibroids and reported that LMSs were significantly larger than other uterine smooth muscle tumours [35]. They were all solitary, and seven of eight lesions had a diameter ≥ 8  cm. Degenerative cystic changes were observed in four lesions, and increased peripheral and central vascularity was demonstrated in seven lesions. Sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of increased central and peripheral vascularity in the diagnosis of LMS were 100, 86 and 19  %, respectively. Combining other sonographic findings with marked central vascularity, the positive predictive value increased to 60  %, but sensitivity decreased to 75  %. 2 D ultrasound Power Doppler (USPD) {{may be related to the}} nature of the tumour, with a peak systolic velocity having a sensitivity of 80  % for detecting sarcoma with a specificity of 97  %.

40|$|The {{goal of the}} {{research}} described in this thesis was to build a system that supports without interferinq with the activity of systematic software design and tokes upon itself Mechanical activities the designer can be spared. Two of the Main activities which constitute the process of software creation are: 1. Designing {{a solution to the}} problem. 2. Implementing the design. The activity of design hos to be performed by the programmer himself, it can only be aided by the computer. Producing a program from a complete design is a mechanical activity the computer can take upon herself. These observations lead to the following objectives that a software design system should meet: 1. Providing tools that support the design activity and enable Maximum flexibility. 2. Recognizing the lowest level primitives of the design as the target language and producing the program in this language. A system along these guidelines was implemented. It permits the user to write definitions which refine high level design decisions into lower levels and, at the same time, serve as syntax description and translation rules for the languages used in the design. The system operates in two user-controlled passes. In the first pass the user's definitions are read, either interactively or from external files, and the syntax rules are stored in a dictionary. In the second pass a syntax driven language processor uses the dictionary to compile the user's program into the target language which consists of the lowest level constructs of the design. Due to the freedom the programmer has in design, several kinds of syntactic ambiguities may be introduced with - or without - the user's attention. <b>Unless</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> user errors, the translator tries to resolve these ambiguities to match the designers intentions. In order {{to reduce the amount of}} time and space required for parsing, long texts are divided into subtexts which are translated separately. Guidance as to which subtexts are separately translatable is provided by the user in a natural way by composing the design of statements. A command language enables the user to control the passes, to look at the contents of the dictionary and of external files, to monitor the translation process for debugging purposes, to store dictionaries for later use and retrieve them and to modify specials symbols used in definitions. The system is implemented in Simula. A second system is presently being implemented as part of POL (Problem Oriented Language), a system for writing and using application language. POL's metalanguage enables the user to build - or extend - object languages by writing new syntax rules. The tools of the development system described above are incorporated into the metalanguage in order to aid the aplication programmer in the design and compilation of the semantic routines of these rules...|$|E
40|$|Security {{assurance}} is {{an important}} challenge for modern computing. Intentional information release (declassiﬁcation) is often crucial for such assurance. Security-critical systems demand expressive policies for information release that are beyond what conventional security models may offer. This thesis studies practical and theoretical aspects of information release. It starts with {{a case study of}} implementing a declassiﬁcation-intensive security protocol in a security-typed language. This, largest up to the publication date, case study suggests patterns for secure programming and demonstrates the multifaceted nature of declassiﬁcation: from near-innocent relabeling of a ciphertext to potentially dangerous release of secret keys. The thesis further explores different aspects of information release. We present a policy cryptographically-masked ﬂows that enables reasoning about information ﬂow in the presence of encryption, decryption, and key generation. We propose a type system that enforces security for a small imperative language with cryptographic primitives, which prevents dangerous program behavior such as giving away a secret key or confusing keys and non-keys. This approach is exempliﬁed with secure implementations of cryptographic protocols. To facilitate reasoning about release of keys, the thesis suggests an attacker-centric model of gradual release that formalizes a concept of attacker’s knowl- edge. The essence of gradual release is that during a program run the knowledge should not change <b>unless</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> an explicit declassiﬁcation. This {{turns out to be a}} powerful foundation for release policies, which we demonstrate by formally connecting revelation-based and encryption-based declassiﬁcation. We also show how gradual release can be enforced by security types and effects. Addressing one aspect of declassiﬁcation while leaving out the others would not be quite adequate. We present two conditions that can express both what is released and where in code release happens. For one of them, we give a conventional deﬁnition and show that a security type system from the literature (which was designed for treating the what aspect) in fact enforces the combination of what and where policies. The other one is a general framework for rich information-release policies. We present tight and modular enforcement by hybrid mechanisms that combine monitoring with on-the-ﬂy program analysis for a language with dynamic code evaluation and communication primitives. The thesis also analyzes security guarantees for programs with communication primitives if one ignores termination leaks — an assumption often made by the existing information-ﬂow tools. We develop a deﬁnition of termination-insensitive noninterference suitable for reasoning about such programs which generalises traditional “batch-job” style deﬁnitions and is satisﬁed by a Denning-style program analysis. Although more than a bit of information can be leaked by programs satisfying this condition, we show that the best an attacker can do is a brute-force attack. If we further assume uniform distribution of secrets, we show that the advantage the attacker gains when guessing the secret after observing a polynomial amount of output is negligible in the size of the secret...|$|E

50|$|The lagoon {{was located}} {{so close to}} the coast that the tidal waters {{eventually}} forced a breach into the bank which separated the lagoon from the sea, and ruined the supply of fresh water.

40|$|Low-back pain {{diseases}} (LBPD) {{belong to}} the most frequent diagnoses determined by general practitioners, and constitute {{one of the most}} common reasons for sick leave and permanent disability pension in the Czech Republic and other European countries. Epidemiological studies have shown a statistically significant association between LBPD and certain types of occupational burden. However, in the Czech Republic, LBPD <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> overload and/or whole-body vibrations have not yet been included in the list of occupational diseases. The aim of this study was to collect and compare the systems, criteria and diagnoses used to recognize LBPD as occupational diseases in other European countries. A questionnaire focused on LBPD was distributed and answered by specialists in occupational diseases in European countries. It included items concerning LBPD in the national list of occupational diseases, and work-related and diagnostic criteria that need to be fulfilled for recognizing LBPD as occupational diseases and possible awarding compensations to the patients. In 13 countries out of the 23 countries studied, LBPD <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> overload can be recognized as occupational, providing that the diagnosis is sufficiently proven and exposure criteria and/or listed occupation are met and duration of exposure is confirmed (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, Macedonia, Netherlands, Romania, Slovakia, Sweden, and Switzerland). LBPD due to vibrations can be also recognized as occupational in 14 countries. In 8 countries LBPD are not accepted as occupational <b>unless</b> they are <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> an injury at work. Specific criteria to evaluate occupational exposure of patients with LBPD were set in Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Lithuania, Macedonia, Netherlands, and Slovakia. In other countries, the evaluation is done at an individual basis. In practice, the assessment of occupational overload and its contribution to the development of LBPD as well as its inclusion in the compensation system are important for several reasons. Firstly, it may be considered essentially preventable. Secondly, cases with a significant contribution of occupational aetiology may be viewed as occupational diseases for which compensation may be claimed, as it is the case in many European countries. Importantly, inclusion of LBPD in the list of occupational diseases or another system of compensation may be viewed as a preventive measure as it increases the visibility of this problem not only for the workers, but especially for the employer...|$|R

40|$|PhDA {{reconstruction}} of climate {{at the southern}} end of Hudson Bay has been developed for the period from 1714 to 1852 from diaries, weather journals and instrumental records maintained by employees of the Hudson's Bay Company. In order to cope with a variety of data, that can be generally classified as historical or secular, a coding technique for adaptation to a computer was developed that allowed for the integration of the two distinctly different types of material. Two sites at York Factory and Churchill Factory located approximately 100 miles apart on the southwest shore of Hudson Bay were studied. In this way homogeneity could be checked because changes at one site would be reflected in changes at the other <b>unless</b> they were <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> local variations. The study provides a long term record of climate change in a region that has received very little attention and yet is very significant to the general pattern of climates in the northern hemisphere. Analysis of temperature, wind, precipitation, thunder and lightning, frost, and phenologic events indicate trends similar to those found in other parts of the northern hemisphere, but attempts at comparison of individual years with those experienced in Europe proved fruitless. The weather was more severe than at present in the first half of the 18 th Century with colder temperatures, more days with snowfall and a higher percentage of northerly winds. From approximately 1780 to 1815 there appears to have been a great deal of variability in the weather particularly in the number of days with precipitation. A critical change seems to have occurred in 1760. Prior to that date the two sites experienced very similar weather but after that date the variations are similar but the intensities and frequencies of events are quite different.
