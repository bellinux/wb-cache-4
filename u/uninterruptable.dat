40|$|Abstract: The Earth {{today is}} facing a major problem of energy crisis and use of new {{reliable}} renewable energy sources is the need of the hour. Micro-organisms use soil and other organic materials in the soil to produce free ions by their metabolic activity which are left uncollected. These free ions are collected using metal electrodes with soil acting as an electrolyte or medium of transfer of ions. Each electrode produces a certain potential voltage and few tens of mill amperes of current. Thus a pair {{of positive and negative}} electrodes inserted in soil kept in an insulating container is a ‘soil cell’. The voltage can be increased by connecting multiple electrodes in series and current by connecting soil cells in parallel. Series and parallel combination of soil cells becomes a ‘soil battery’. The energy from the soil can be used as an <b>uninterruptable</b> power source to light a small cabinet along with a solar panel. The energy from Soil Battery can be used for lighting purpose when the solar panel is not functional or when its efficiency is low. The maximum power point tracking controller ensures optimum power output from both the soil battery and the solar panel, whatever be the battery voltage or the driving load. Thus a small grid comprising of soil battery, solar panel and a secondary battery can be used as an <b>uninterruptable</b> power supply with the optimum source in terms of power driving the load...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- —This paper {{presents}} {{simulation results}} of a grid interactive Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) system using fuel-cell and ultra-capacitor storage. The system incorporates 40 kW of grid input supply, a 45 kVA power conditioning unit capable of operating in both inverting and charging modes, and a 16 -Ah battery bank. It was aimed to demonstrate the capability of the system to provide uninterrupted power, demand side management function and load voltage stabilization in a grid which experiences frequent blackouts and under/over voltage problems. Fuel cells (FCs) are being considered as a impending substitute in long term to replace diesel/gasoline combustion engines in vehicles and emergency power sources. However, soaring cost and sluggish dynamic response of FC still persevere as the main hurdles for wider applications. To remedy this problem, energy storage systems like ultra capacitors (UC) with adequate power capacity have to be incorporated. UC are in general very faster in charging and discharging operation and can also be helpful in improving power factor {{at the point of}} inter-connection. The results prove the efficiency of fuel cell and ultra-capacitor in maintaining <b>uninterruptable</b> supply to load centers. Keywords—buck-boost converter, fuel cell, super-capacitor, <b>uninterruptable</b> power supply, wind energy conversion system With the increased usage of electrical equipment for various applications, the demand for quality power apart from continuous power availability has increased and hence requires the development of appropriate power conditioning system.
