5|$|Queen {{and worker}} {{bumblebees}} can sting. <b>Unlike</b> <b>in</b> honeybees, a bumblebee's sting lacks barbs, so the bee can sting repeatedly without injuring itself; {{by the same}} token, the sting is not left in the wound. Bumblebee species are not normally aggressive, but may sting in defence of their nest, or if harmed. Female cuckoo bumblebees aggressively attack host colony members, and sting the host queen, but ignore other animals unless disturbed.|$|E

Current {{scientific}} theory suggests that snake venom is not used for defense or for competition between members of the same species, <b>unlike</b> <b>in</b> other taxa. Thus adaptive evolution in snake venom has resulted in several adaptations with respect to these diet-related functions that increase the fitness of the snakes that carry them.|$|E
