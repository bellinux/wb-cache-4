5|$|In the legion, the velites were {{attached}} to each maniple of hastati, principes and triarii.

After they had fallen back, they would move up behind the attacking troops and throw darts at the enemy. They also sometimes carried wounded back to the rear, however usually a corps of deportates did this. In a pitched battle, the velites would form <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the front of the legion and cover the advance of the hastati, who were armed with swords. If the hastati failed to break the enemy, they would fall back and let the principes, similarly equipped though more experienced infantry, take over. If the principes failed, they would retire behind the triarii, well trained, heavily armoured, spear armed legionaries and let them attack.|$|E
