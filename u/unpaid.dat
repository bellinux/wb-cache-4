5|$|Even {{accounting}} measures {{intended to}} recognize gender disparities are criticized for ignoring <b>unpaid</b> work. Two such examples are the Gender-related Development Index (GDI) and the Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM), {{neither of which}} include much <b>unpaid</b> work. So feminist economics calls for a more comprehensive index which includes participation in <b>unpaid</b> work.|$|E
5|$|Feminist economists {{join the}} UN {{and others in}} {{acknowledging}} care work, {{as a kind of}} work which includes all tasks involving caregiving, as central to economic development and human well-being. Feminist economists study both paid and <b>unpaid</b> care work. They argue that traditional analysis of economics often ignores the value of household <b>unpaid</b> work. Feminist economists have argued that <b>unpaid</b> domestic work is as valuable as paid work, so measures of economic success should include <b>unpaid</b> work. They have shown that women are disproportionately responsible for performing such care work.|$|E
5|$|Efforts to {{calculate}} the true economic value of <b>unpaid</b> work, which {{is not included in}} measures such as gross domestic product, have shown that this value is enormous. In the United States, it has been estimated to be between 20–50%, meaning that the true value of <b>unpaid</b> work is trillions of dollars per year. For other countries, the percentage of GDP may be even higher, such as the United Kingdom, where is may be as high as 70%. Because this <b>unpaid</b> work is largely done by women and is unreported in economic indicators, it results in these contributions by women being devalued in a society.|$|E
5|$|In {{more recent}} years {{there has been}} {{increasing}} attention to this issue, such as recognition of <b>unpaid</b> work within SNA reports and a commitment by the UN to the measurement and valuation of <b>unpaid</b> work, emphasizing care work done by women. This goal was restated at the 1995 UN Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing.|$|E
5|$|Bjarni was {{sentence}}d to 6 months in prison by the District Court of Reykjavik for major tax noncompliance. His sentence was suspended and he was additionally ordered to repay nearly 36 million ISK of <b>unpaid</b> tax. The Supreme Court of Iceland increased his suspended sentence to 8 months.|$|E
5|$|Celia Imrie as Madge Hardcastle, who has {{had several}} {{unsuccessful}} marriages. Like Norman, she wants fun, adventure and a new mate. Tired of her daughter's attempts to keep her as <b>unpaid</b> babysitter, she flees for anywhere, choosing India.|$|E
5|$|Double {{burden is}} a term used to {{describe}} the workload of people who work to earn money, but who are also responsible for significant amounts of <b>unpaid</b> domestic labor. This phenomenon is also known as The Second Shift as in Arlie Hochschild's book of the same name. In heterosexual couples where both partners have paid jobs, women often spend significantly more time than men on household chores and caring work, such as childrearing or caring for sick family members. This outcome is determined in large part by traditional gender roles that have been accepted by society over time. Labor market constraints also play a role in determining who does the bulk of <b>unpaid</b> work.|$|E
5|$|Heinz Field {{served as}} the home field of the Gotham Rogues in the 2012 film The Dark Knight Rises. An {{estimated}} 15,000 <b>unpaid</b> extras filled the stadium during shooting on August 6, 2011.|$|E
5|$|His {{departure}} was soured when he {{was forced}} to go to the Football League with a Professional Footballers' Association representative to win £8,327.15 of an <b>unpaid</b> signing-on fee.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, Newt Gingrich filed a debt {{settlement}} plan document with the Federal Election Commission indicating his 2012 presidential campaign would pay zero dollars toward {{the more than}} $4.6 million in <b>unpaid</b> debts owed to 114 businesses and consultants.|$|E
5|$|In July 2012 Brown {{was named}} by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon as a United Nations Special Envoy on Global Education. He chaired the International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity. The {{position}} is <b>unpaid.</b>|$|E
5|$|Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow: Captain of the Black Pearl. He is hunted by the Kraken {{because of}} his <b>unpaid</b> blood debt to Davy Jones. He {{searches}} for the Dead Man's Chest to free himself from Jones' servitude.|$|E
5|$|Not all {{payments}} in kind {{were converted to}} cash, offerings of rice, bananas, milk, dried fish, game meat and curd persisted. Some inhabitants also had to render <b>unpaid</b> personal services called uliyam.|$|E
5|$|Since 1900, Tesla {{had been}} living at the Waldorf Astoria in New York running up a large bill. In 1922, he moved to St. Regis Hotel and would follow a pattern from then on of moving to a new hotel every few years leaving behind <b>unpaid</b> bills.|$|E
5|$|Tesla's <b>unpaid</b> bills, and {{complaints}} about the mess from his pigeon-feeding, forced {{him to leave the}} St. Regis in 1923, the Hotel Pennsylvania in 1930, and the Hotel Governor Clinton in 1934. At one point, he also took rooms at the Hotel Marguery.|$|E
5|$|That April, Voorhees filed a writ of {{attachment}} against Jackalow for <b>unpaid</b> attorney's fees, and the Leetes' executors {{were said to be}} contemplating similar action. The $389 that Jackalow was carrying {{at the time of his}} arrest eventually went to his lawyers.|$|E
5|$|The club's {{training}} ground is Beechings Cross, in Grange Road, Gillingham. In 2012 {{the club was}} involved in a dispute with the local council, who alleged that Gillingham owed over £30,000 in <b>unpaid</b> bills relating to the facility.|$|E
5|$|The figures include interest, penalties, {{restitution}} for <b>unpaid</b> {{taxes and}} disgorgement of profits. As {{part of the}} deal, UBS also settled Securities and Exchange Commission charges of having acted as an unregistered broker/dealer and investment adviser for Americans.|$|E
5|$|Training was {{undertaken}} {{on a voluntary}} and <b>unpaid</b> basis with weekly parades being undertaken at Kelvin Grove, while field training took place at Fraser's Paddock in Enoggera and Redbank. By July 1939, the battalion's strength was 550 officers and other ranks.|$|E
5|$|After Bardanes's retirement, Nikephoros {{formally}} dismissed him and confiscated {{much of his}} property. The other thematic generals {{who took}} part in the revolt were also dismissed from their posts, the metropolitan bishops of Sardis, Amorion and Nicomedia were punished for their support of the uprising by exile to the small island of Pantelleria off Sicily, while the soldiers of the Anatolian armies were left <b>unpaid</b> for a year.|$|E
5|$|Another {{aspect of}} the double burden in Africa {{is that there is}} class divide, meaning that most white families, {{including}} poor ones, employ Africans either as a live-in worker or a part-time worker. In addition, because of the urban house shortage, oftentimes relatives and friends are given room and board in exchange for <b>unpaid</b> work, alleviating work for some.|$|E
5|$|As {{the term}} double burden might suggest, when people {{consider}} paid work vs. <b>unpaid</b> work, they often consider them as two separate entities - {{that the man}} or woman is doing one or the other, {{but not at the}} same time. In reality, men and especially women often undertake both paid and <b>unpaid</b> labor simultaneously, creating the issue of work intensity, where the person undertakes many activities {{at the same time in}} order to compensate for the time necessary to accomplish many things in one day. Household surveys often only let people write down one thing that they are doing at any given time, and do not take into consideration that they may be cooking while cleaning, or sewing while taking care of the children. Because of this, the time taken for child care and other domestic activities may be underestimated. This coping mechanism of undertaking two or more tasks at once can especially be seen in women in developing countries. For example, many Caribbean rural women use this as a method of increasing the number of things they can accomplish in a day.|$|E
5|$|Clinton {{was inaugurated}} as the 42nd President of the United States on January 20, 1993. Less {{than a month}} after taking office, he signed the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, which {{required}} large employers to allow employees to take <b>unpaid</b> leave for pregnancy or a serious medical condition. This action had bipartisan support, and was popular with the public.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{economists have}} also {{highlighted}} power and inequality issues within families and households. For example, Randy Albelda shows that responsibility for care work influences the time poverty experienced by single {{mothers in the}} United States. Similarly, Sarah Gammage examines the effects of <b>unpaid</b> care work performed by women in Guatemala. The work of the Equality Studies Department at University College Dublin {{such as that of}} Sara Cantillon has focused on inequalities of domestic arrangements within even affluent households.|$|E
5|$|For example, Bina Agarwal {{and others}} have critiqued the {{mainstream}} model and helped provide {{a better understanding of}} intra-household bargaining power. Agarwal shows that a lack of power and outside options for women hinders their ability to negotiate within their families. Amartya Sen shows how social norms that devalue women's <b>unpaid</b> work in the household often disadvantage women in intra-household bargaining. These feminist economists argue that such claims have important economic outcomes which must be recognized within economic frameworks.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1824 as the National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck, the RNLI {{was granted}} a Royal Charter in 1860 and is a charity in the UK and Republic of Ireland. Queen Elizabeth II is Patron. The RNLI is principally funded by {{legacies}} and donations with most lifeboat crew members being <b>unpaid</b> volunteers.|$|E
5|$|From 1969 to 1975, Baxter was {{part-time}} and <b>unpaid</b> {{chairman of}} the Sydney Opera House Trust. He had recently retired from the UNSW, but the job was no sinecure. The architect, Jørn Utzon, had left, construction was behind schedule and over budget, and specialist staff needed to be recruited. Baxter put the project under his unpopular but decisive grip, and brought the Sydney Opera House to completion and opening on 20 October 1973.|$|E
5|$|Government family-friendly {{initiatives}} such {{as child}} subsidies and cheaper child care facilities can also greatly decrease the gender {{difference in the}} workplace, due to the woman being able to work longer hours outside the home. In addition, when developing policies related to paid work, {{it is important to}} do gender impact assessments in order {{to assess the impact of}} a policy on both the paid and <b>unpaid</b> sector.|$|E
5|$|In 1741 Adam {{was forced}} to {{initiate}} legal proceedings against William, Lord Braco, to retrieve <b>unpaid</b> fees arising from his work at Duff House. There was no formal contract, and client and architect disagreed on costs for carved stonework. Adam sued for £5,796 12s 11⅓d, and the matter was initially resolved in his favour. However, Braco was a stubborn opponent, and dragged out the proceedings, which were not resolved until just before Adam's death.|$|E
5|$|In 1851, the Liberals gained {{office on}} Prince Edward Island. They {{immediately}} went about putting in place measures to gradually dismantle the proprietor/tenant system, although their efforts generally had limited effect largely because Samuel Cunard, who owned one-sixth of the Island, refused to sell {{any of his}} land. In 1864, the tenants organised into the Tenant League, and vowed to resist the collection of rent by their proprietors. Efforts by law enforcement to quell this rebellion had little effect, so {{the government of the}} island requested the assistance of British troops to enforce the collection of rent. In 1865, British troops arrived in the colony and successfully enforced the collection of the <b>unpaid</b> rent, and the Tenant League crumbled. It appeared that the operation of the Tenant League was a matter of principle rather than practical necessity; the rent paid by tenants to the proprietors was to the amount of one shilling per acre, and the proprietors allowed rent to go <b>unpaid</b> for years at a time.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, Shafer {{signed with}} Cap Anson's Chicago White Stockings. However, {{he had left}} Indianapolis the {{previous}} year with some <b>unpaid</b> debts. The White Stockings traveled to Indianapolis to play an exhibition game in June, and the local sheriff was waiting for both him and teammate Silver Flint. After the game, Shafer and Flint escaped the ballpark in a horse-drawn carriage to avoid arrest, and only their manager, Anson, was taken to jail.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Johnson {{became a}} {{minority}} {{owner of the}} Lakers, having reportedly paid more than $10million for part ownership. He also held the title of team vice president. Johnson sold his ownership stake in the Lakers in October 2010 to Patrick Soon-Shiong, a Los Angeles surgeon and professor at UCLA, but continued as an <b>unpaid</b> vice president for the team. In February 2017, Johnson returned to the Lakers as an advisor to Jeanie Buss.|$|E
5|$|In June 2002, {{the plane}} was impounded at London Heathrow Airport, United Kingdom, {{following}} <b>unpaid</b> debts of £4 million owned by the national carrier to parts supplier AJ Walters Aviation, causing services between Accra, the UK and Italy to be temporarily suspended. The airline went bankrupt in 2005. Following this, {{the plane was}} abandoned and left at Kotaka Airport; {{over the course of}} the following years, various parts were sold for scrap, including the three engines.|$|E
5|$|In September 2009, NatWest and RBS both {{announced}} dramatic cuts {{in their}} overdraft fees. The <b>unpaid</b> item fee {{was reduced to}} £5 from £38 and the card misuse fee was reduced from £35 to £15. The cuts {{came at a time}} when the row over the legality of unauthorised borrowing, estimated to earn current account providers about £2.6bn a year, had reached the House of Lords.|$|E
5|$|In {{a number}} of countries, mainly in Asia, {{legislation}} or corporate practice has introduced formal menstrual leave to provide women with either paid or <b>unpaid</b> {{leave of absence from}} their employment while they are menstruating. Countries with policies include Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, and South Korea. The practice is controversial due to concerns that it bolsters the perception of women as weak, inefficient workers, as well as concerns that it is unfair to men.|$|E
5|$|In his Federalist No. 43, {{published}} January 23, 1788, James Madison {{argued that}} the new federal government would need authority over a national capital to provide for its own maintenance and safety. Five years earlier, a band of <b>unpaid</b> soldiers besieged Congress while its members were meeting in Philadelphia. Known as the Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783, the event emphasized {{the need for the}} national government not to rely on any state for its own security.|$|E
