5|$|As {{the year}} progressed, Calvin and Farel's {{reputation}} with the council began to suffer. The council {{was reluctant to}} enforce the subscription requirement, as only a few citizens had subscribed to their confession of faith. On 26 November, the two ministers hotly debated the council over the issue. Furthermore, France was taking an interest in forming an alliance with Geneva and as the two ministers were Frenchmen, councillors had begun to question their loyalty. Finally, a major ecclesiastical-political quarrel developed when the city of Bern, Geneva's ally in the reformation of the Swiss churches, proposed to introduce uniformity in the church ceremonies. One proposal required the use of <b>unleavened</b> <b>bread</b> for the Eucharist. The two ministers were unwilling to follow Bern's lead and delayed {{the use of such}} bread until a synod in Zurich could be convened to make the final decision. The council ordered Calvin and Farel to use <b>unleavened</b> <b>bread</b> for the Easter Eucharist. In protest, they refused to administer communion during the Easter service. This caused a riot during the service and the next day, the council told Farel and Calvin to leave Geneva.|$|E
5|$|Palestinians bake {{a variety}} of {{different}} kinds of breads: they include khubz, pita and markook and taboon. Khubz is an everyday bread and is very similar to pita. It often takes the place of utensils; It is torn into bite size pieces and used to scoop various dips such as hummus or ful. Markook bread is a paper-thin <b>unleavened</b> <b>bread</b> and when unfolded it is almost transparent. Taboon receives its name from the ovens used to bake them.|$|E

40|$|The <b>unleavened</b> flat <b>breads</b> were {{prepared}} from Whole Wheat Flour (WWF) fortified with 16 % Partially Defatted Flaxseed Flour (PDF) and 12 % full fat flaxseed flour. Similarly Straight Grade Flour (SGF) {{used for the}} production of pan bread was fortified with both 12 % PDF and FFF. The resultant <b>unleavened</b> flat <b>breads</b> and pan breads were analyzed for their dietary fiber, amino acid and fatty acid profile. The <b>unleavened</b> flat <b>breads</b> and breads prepared from both PDF and FFF supplemented composite flours yielded significantly higher contents of soluble, non soluble and total dietary fibers. <b>Unleavened</b> flat <b>breads</b> possessed higher dietary fiber content than those of <b>breads.</b> The <b>unleavened</b> flat <b>breads</b> prepared from 16 % PDF supplemented WWF possessed significantly the highest content of isoleucine (1. 16 g/ 100 g flour) and the lowest isoleucine content (0. 45 g/ 100 g flour) was found in breads prepared from control flour (100 % SGF). The results indicated that contents of all the tested essential amino acids were improved substantially by the supplementation of PDF and FFF in the wheat flours. <b>Unleavened</b> flat <b>breads</b> containing 12 % FFF possessed the highest content of palmitic (0. 595 %) and stearic acid (0. 152 %). The results further indicate that an excellent ratio of linoleic acid over linolenic existed in the <b>unleavened</b> flat <b>breads</b> and breads prepared from full fat flaxseed supplemented composite flours...|$|R

25|$|When the Pharaoh {{freed the}} Israelites, {{it is said}} that they left in such a hurry that they could not wait for bread dough to rise (leaven). In commemoration, for the {{duration}} of Passover no leavened bread is eaten, for which reason Passover was called the feast of <b>unleavened</b> <b>bread</b> in the Torah or Old Testament. Thus matzo (flat <b>unleavened</b> <b>bread)</b> is eaten during Passover and it is a tradition of the holiday.|$|E
25|$|Generally {{a loaf of}} leavened {{bread is}} used as an emblem of Christ's body – though many {{assemblies}} use <b>unleavened</b> <b>bread</b> or matzos. After giving thanks for the loaf, it is broken and circulated to the quiet, seated congregation. Congregants will break off small pieces, or take small pieces of broken <b>unleavened</b> <b>bread,</b> as it is passed, and eat them individually (i.e. not waiting for a group invitation to consume it together). At this time, the worshipper usually engages in silent prayerful worship of the Lord Jesus Christ.|$|E

50|$|From {{the culinary}} point of view, {{it is useful}} to {{consider}} the Indian subcontinent to be the entire historical region encompassed prior to independence since August 1947; that is, the modern countries of India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. It is usual to distinguish broadly between northern and southern styles of Indian cuisine, recognising that within those categories are innumerable sub-styles and variations. The distinction is commonly made with reference to the staple starch: wheat in the form of <b>unleavened</b> <b>breads</b> in the north; rice in the east; rice and millet in the south.|$|R

25|$|In Reformed churches {{throughout}} continental Europe in {{the sixteenth}} and seventeenth centuries, the Lord's Supper was celebrated on feast days, and parishioners were expected to dress in a dignified manner.

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{versions of}} the accusation involved Jews crucifying Christian children on Easter/Passover because of a prophecy. There is no reference {{to the use of}} blood in <b>unleavened</b> matzo <b>bread,</b> which evolves later as a major motivation for the crime.|$|R

25|$|Perhaps {{the oldest}} and most {{important}} feast celebrated by the Jews is the Passover. The original feast, with its origins in the story of the Exodus, consisted of a sacrificial lamb, bitter herbs and <b>unleavened</b> <b>bread</b> eaten by each family at home. Under the Israelite monarchy, and with the establishment of the Temple in Jerusalem, the sacrifice and celebration of Passover became centralized as one of the three pilgrimage festivals. Families who were able to travel to Jerusalem ate the Passover meal together in Jerusalem. Those who could not make the pilgrimage celebrated the holiday by holding a special meal and observing the Feast of <b>Unleavened</b> <b>Bread.</b>|$|E
25|$|Philo {{wrote that}} God {{instructed}} the Israelites to offer <b>unleavened</b> <b>bread</b> and bitter herbs {{together with the}} Passover sacrifice because <b>unleavened</b> <b>bread</b> signified great haste and speed, while bitter herbs signified the life of bitterness and struggle that the Israelites endured as slaves. Philo also taught that the deeper meaning was that leavened and fermented foods rose, while unleavened foods remained low, and each of these states symbolized types of the soul. Leavening symbolized the haughty soul swollen with arrogance, while the unleavened symbolized the unchangeable and prudent soul choosing the middle way rather than extremes. The bitter herbs manifested a psychic migration from passion to impassivity and from wickedness to virtue. For, Philo taught, those who naturally and genuinely repented became bitter toward their former way of life, lamenting {{the time that they}} had given over to the seductive and deceitful mistress of desire, being deceived by desire when they ought to have renewed themselves and advanced in the contemplation of wisdom toward the goal of a happy and immortal life. And so, those who desired repentance ate the <b>unleavened</b> <b>bread</b> with bitter herbs; they first ate bitterness over their old and unendurable life, and then ate the opposite of boastful arrogance in meditation on humility. For, Philo concluded, the memory of former sins caused fear, and by restraining sin through recollection, brought profit to the mind.|$|E
25|$|By {{entering}} into the Union, Atanasie {{and the other}} bishops, along with their respective dioceses accepted the supreme authority of the Pope, {{while at the same}} time being granted the right to keep their own Greek Byzantine liturgical rite. A Diploma issued by the Emperor Leopold I declared that Transylvania's Romanian Orthodox Church is one with the Roman Catholic Church. Transylvanian Romanians were therefore encouraged to convert to Catholicism and join the newly created Greek-Catholic Church, while being able to retain the Byzantine rite, if at the same time they accepted four doctrinal points promulgated by the Council of Florence (1431 and 1445): the supreme authority of the Pope over the entire church; the existence of Purgatory; the Filioque clause; and the validity of the use of <b>unleavened</b> <b>bread</b> in the celebration of the Eucharist in the Latin Church (Eastern Orthodox had contended that Roman Catholic use of <b>unleavened</b> <b>bread</b> was erroneous).|$|E

25|$|The Torah {{says that}} it is because the Hebrews left Egypt with such haste that {{there was no time to}} allow baked bread to rise; thus flat, <b>unleavened</b> <b>bread,</b> matzo, is a {{reminder}} of the rapid departure of the Exodus. Other scholars teach that in the time of the Exodus, matzo was commonly baked for the purpose of traveling because it preserved well and was light to carry (making it similar to hardtack), suggesting that matzo was baked intentionally for the long journey ahead.|$|E
25|$|The Memorial, held after sunset, {{includes}} a {{talk on the}} meaning of the celebration and the circulation among the audience of unadulterated red wine and <b>unleavened</b> <b>bread.</b> Jehovah's Witnesses believe the bread symbolizes Jesus Christ's body which he gave on behalf of mankind, and that the wine symbolizes his blood which redeems from sin. They do not believe in transubstantiation or consubstantiation. Because many congregations have no members who claim to be anointed, it is common for no one to partake of the bread and wine.|$|E

There are also a number of flat <b>breads</b> and pulled <b>unleavened</b> pan-fried <b>breads.</b>|$|R
25|$|Although {{many members}} of the Church of England today would still be uncomfortable or sceptical about certain Catholic liturgical practices, they can be {{astonished}} to be told that, in the late 19th century, using incense, wearing vestments, putting candles on the altar and using <b>unleavened</b> (wafer) <b>bread</b> in the Eucharist could spark riots, put priests in prison and even led in 1888–90 to the prosecution of a bishop – Edward King, Bishop of Lincoln.|$|R
25|$|A {{symbol of}} the Passover holiday is matzo, an unleavened flatbread made solely from flour and water which is {{continually}} worked from mixing through baking, {{so that it is}} not allowed to rise. Matzo may be made by machine or by hand. The Torah contains an instruction to eat matzo, specifically, on the first night of Passover and to eat only <b>unleavened</b> <b>bread</b> (in practice, matzo) during the entire week of Passover. Consequently, the eating of matzo figures prominently in the Passover Seder. There are several explanations for this.|$|E
25|$|Karaites and Samaritans use {{different}} versions of the Jewish calendar, which are often out of sync with the modern Jewish calendar by one or two days. In 2009, for example, Nisan 15 on the Jewish calendar used by Rabbinic Judaism corresponds to April 9. On the calendars used by Karaites and Samaritans, Abib or Aviv 15 (as opposed to 'Nisan') corresponds to April 11 in 2009. The Karaite and Samaritan Passovers are each one day long, followed by the six-day Festival of <b>Unleavened</b> <b>Bread</b> – for a total of seven days.|$|E
