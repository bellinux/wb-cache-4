RESULTS: The annual mean health benefits of reducing the mean PM(10) exposure estimated for {{the population in the}} study area (50 microg/m(3)) to the annual <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> recommended by the World Health Organization (20 microg/m(3)) were estimated to be 3, 500 fewer deaths (representing an average increase in life expectancy of 14 months), 1, 800 fewer hospitalizations for cardio-respiratory diseases, 5, 100 fewer cases of chronic bronchitis among adults, 31, 100 fewer cases of acute bronchitis among children, and 54, 000 fewer asthma attacks among children and adults. The mean total monetary benefits were estimated to be 6, 400 million euros per year. Reducing PM(10) to comply with the current European Union regulatory annual mean level (40 microg/m(3)) would yield approximately one third of these benefits.

3000|$|Only a few {{household}} expenditure surveys collect price data. In the literature, {{there are two}} main methods for retrieving price data from expenditure and quantity variables: using <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> as proxy for market prices, as Abdulai ([2002]) or Akbay et al. ([2007]) did by dividing the expenditure by the quantity consumed. The other method of quality-adjusted <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> was originally introduced by Cox and Wohlgenant ([1986]) and is frequently applied in the literature (e.g., in Lazaridis [2003]; Thiele [2010]; Zheng and Henneberry [2010]). Despite the nomenclature, <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> still have a quality aspect, because of the heterogeneity of products within a given category (e.g., wine). The consumer can select between different quality levels, leading to different <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> among households; differences in <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> can be attributed to quality and price variations (Chung et al. [2005]). An increase in the <b>unit</b> <b>value</b> could be induced by a price increase or by a shift in the household’s demand for more expensive products within this particular product category. Thus, taking <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> as proxies for market prices could lead to biased parameter estimates. This is particularly true for composite commodities (Chung et al. [2005]), such as the beverage product groups used in this study, which contain products of varying qualities.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Lung {{ultrasonography}} (LUS) {{has been}} used for non-invasive detection of pulmonary edema. Semi-quantitative LUS visual scores (V-LUS) based on B-lines are moderately correlated with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and extravascular lung water (EVLW). A new quantitative computer-aided LUS analysis (Q-LUS) has been recently proposed. AIMS: This study investigated 1) whether Q-LUS better correlates with PCWP and EVLW than V-LUS; 2) to which extent positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) affect the assessment of pulmonary edema by Q-LUS or V-LUS. METHODS: 48 mechanically ventilated patients with PEEP of 5 or 10 cmH 2 O and monitored by PCWP (n= 28) or EVLW (n= 20) were studied. RESULTS: PCWP was significantly and strongly correlated with Q-LUS Grey <b>Unit</b> <b>value</b> (r 2 = 0. 70) but weakly with V-LUS B-line score (r 2 = 0. 20). EVLW was significantly and more strongly correlated with Q-LUS Grey <b>Unit</b> <b>mean</b> <b>value</b> (r 2 = 0. 68) than with V-LUS B-line score (r 2 = 0. 34). Q-LUS showed a better diagnostic accuracy than V-LUS for the detection of PCWP> 18 mmHg or EVLW? 10 mL/kg. With 5 -cmH 2 O PEEP, the correlations with PCWP or EVLW were stronger for Q-LUS than V-LUS. With 10 -cmH 2 O PEEP, the correlations with PCWP or EVLW were still significant for Q-LUS but insignificant for V-LUS. Inter-observer reproducibility was better for Q-LUS than V-LUS. CONCLUSIONS: Both V-LUS and Q-LUS are acceptable indicators of pulmonary edema in mechanically ventilated patients. However, at high PEEP only Q-LUS provides data that are significantly correlated with PCWP and EVLW. Computer-aided Q-LUS has the advantages of being not only independent of operator perception but also of PEEP...|$|R

Volume of the transfer ink has a significant influence on changes in surface roughness of substrates. Surface structures of the textile substrates are filled with ink thus causing changes in surface roughness. For these experiment three different types of screen printing mesh were used with variable mesh density, 46, 54, as well as 90 threads per centimeter.

40|$|A proliferative {{glomerulonephritis}} was induced in rats pre-immunized with rabbit IgG by injecting intravenously a sub-nephrotoxic dose of rabbit anti-glomerular {{basement membrane}} (GBM) IgG (A rats). Most rats (80 %) developed a severe proteinuria (greater than 100 mg/ 24 hr) within {{two to five}} days after the injection of anti-GBM IgG. At the same time, microscopic examination of the kidneys revealed a glomerular infiltration by mononuclear phagocytes and a prominent decrease in the intensity of the colloidal iron reaction in glomeruli. A non-proliferative glomerular disease was induced in another group of rats (B rats) by intraperitoneal administration of aminonucleoside of puromycin. A marked proteinuria (greater than 100 mg/ 24 hr) occurred after six days in 90 % of animals. Histochemical studies then revealed a decrease in staining intensity of glomeruli for polyanion.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse the {{relationship}} between gravity variables and f. o. b. export <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> using Hungarian firm-product-destination data. By taking firm-product level selection into account we show that export <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> increase with distance even for particular firm-product combinations. This cannot be explained by models assuming firm- or even firm-product level selection and constant markups. The differences are important quantitatively; price differences in Hungarian exports between Germany and the US are about 30 %. We also show that <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> are positively related to GDP/capita {{and that there is}} a weak negative relationship between <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> and market size. We propose two possible explanations: first, firms may export different quality versions of the same product to different markets. Secondly, directly exporting firms may capture part of the markups on transport costs in their f. o. b. prices. export, price, selection, Hungary...|$|R
40|$|<b>Unit</b> <b>value</b> or point value {{transfers}} {{from individual}} source studies remain {{the oldest and}} most common form of benefit transfer. Although practitioners generally recommend benefit function transfers, these are not always possible. Where <b>unit</b> <b>value</b> transfers are to be performed, appropriate protocols must be followed to select source studies, transfer values, and perform necessary value adjustments. This chapter demonstrates the processes and challenges involved in the implementation of <b>unit</b> <b>value</b> transfers, using case studies of environmental values in a peri-urban community on the east coast of Australia where key ecosystems ranged from coastal beaches to inland forests. Key issues in evaluating the potential for benefit transfer included the availability and quality of source studies, the extent of overlap between source studies and the target site, the need for different forms of adjustment to account for variations in scope and scale, and the limitations to <b>unit</b> <b>value</b> transfers...|$|R
40|$|There are {{two sides}} to <b>unit</b> <b>value</b> indices. The first is their {{widespread}} and unwarranted use based on customs data as surrogates for price relatives of product groups of exports and imports. For the aggregation of heterogeneous items, superlative price indices are best and <b>unit</b> <b>value</b> indices are biased. The second is the widespread and unwarranted use of price indices for homogeneous items, for which <b>unit</b> <b>value</b> indices are best and superlative price indices are biased. Then there is the "in-between": the case of broadly comparable items. This paper examines such issues. Copyright 2010 The International Monetary Fund.
