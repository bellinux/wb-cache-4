6000|$|So {{that the}} Young Prince's Father, George Friedrich, present incumbent, as we may call him, of Baireuth, found himself--with {{a couple of}} Brothers he has, whom also we may transiently see by and by--in very straitened {{circumstances}} in their young years. THEIR Father, son of younger sons as we saw, was himself poor, and he had Fourteen of them as family. Now, in old King Friedrich I.'s time, it became apparent, as the then reigning Margraf of Baireuth's children all died soon after birth, {{that one of these}} necessitous Fourteen was likely to succeed in Baireuth, if they could hold out. Old King Friedrich thereupon said, [...] "You have chances of succession; true enough,--but nobody knows what will become of that. Sell your chance to me, who am <b>ultimate</b> <b>Heir</b> of all: I will give you a round sum,--the little 'Domain of Weverlingen' in the Halberstadt Country, and say 'Half a Million Thalers;' there you can live comfortably, and support your Fourteen Children,"--"Done," [...] said the necessitous Cousin; went to Weverlingen accordingly; and there lived the rest of his days, till 1708; leaving his necessitous Fourteen, or about Ten of them that were alive and growing up, still all minors, and necessitous enough.|$|E
50|$|He {{was the son}} of Thomas Scrope, a Bristol merchant, {{the third}} son and <b>ultimate</b> <b>heir</b> of Colonel Adrian Scrope of Wormsley in Oxfordshire, the latter hung drawn and {{quartered}} after the restoration as one of the regicides of Charles I.|$|E
5000|$|Ultimus haeres (Latin for <b>ultimate</b> <b>heir)</b> is {{a concept}} in Scots law where if a person in Scotland who dies without leaving a will (i.e. intestate) and has no blood {{relative}} who can be easily traced, the estate is claimed by the Queen's and Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer {{on behalf of the}} Crown.|$|E
5000|$|... :Although the <b>ultimate</b> <b>heirs</b> to the Principality of Antioch was the Kings, later Titular King, of Cyprus, they didn't {{used the}} title of Prince of Antioch nor their wife Princess of Antioch; it was only given to a few heirs to the Cypriot throne and a {{potential}} jure uxoris king.|$|R
50|$|Margaret Flint's {{hostility toward}} her {{daughter}} {{resulted from a}} dispute over Martin Bernye's will. Under normal circumstances, Bernye's numerous estates would pass to Elizabeth's eldest brother Marmaduke. Bernye, however, ultimately changed his will, making Elizabeth and Christopher the <b>ultimate</b> <b>heirs</b> to the Bernye lands, which included Gunton Hall, Netherhall, and various pieces of land in Gunton, as well as Thorpe Market, Suffield, Antingham, Hanworth Abbey, and Bradfield. This greatly angered Elizabeth's mother, who was completely removed from any rights to the wealth and power. Ultimately, however, it was Margaret Flint who prospered; she outlived her daughter and all the property was placed in her name.|$|R
5000|$|William de Brightley, younger son, who {{according}} to Sir William Pole (d.1635) was granted {{by his father}} [...] "in King Henry 2 tyme" [...] (i.e. between 1154 and 1189) the Devonshire manor of Brightley in the parish of Chittlehampton, which he made his seat and where his descendants lived for many generations having adopted [...] "de Brightley" [...] as their surname in lieu of [...] "FitzWarin". They adopted a differenced, simpler, version of the paternal arms, namely Gules, a chief indented argent, which were quartered by their <b>ultimate</b> <b>heirs</b> the Cobley and later Giffard families of Brightley. Surviving images of these de Brightley arms exist on the Giffard monuments in Chittlehampton Church and on the 17th-century escutcheon above the porch of Brightley Barton, and show in addition a mullet gules, a mark of cadency which denotes descent from a third son.|$|R
50|$|Born on Christmas Day 1270, Alice was {{the only}} {{daughter}} and heir of Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln and Margaret Longespée, 4th Countess of Salisbury suo jure (in her own right). Her mother Margaret was the great-granddaughter and <b>ultimate</b> <b>heir</b> {{of one of the}} illegitimate sons of Henry II of England, William Longespée (Longsword), whose nickname became his surname.|$|E
50|$|Scrope's third son, and <b>ultimate</b> <b>heir,</b> was Thomas Scrope, {{whose son}} was John Scrope. John Scrope died without issue in 1752 so the Wormsley estate was {{inherited}} by the heirs {{of his sister}} Anne (d.1720), wife to Henry Fane of Brympton, essentially the third son, Henry Fane of Wormsley (1703-1777). The Fane family held onto Wormsley for circa 230 years, until the 1980s, when sold to a Getty.|$|E
50|$|Under one legitimist theory, Villiers was the {{rightful}} King of England, as the <b>ultimate</b> <b>heir</b> to Anne Stanley, Countess of Castlehaven. Due to disputes over legal standing (some of these theorists contend {{that since the}} person on the throne since 1603 has not been {{the rightful}} monarch, no laws have changed since then, including divorce laws), both his grandson (the 10th Earl) and his eldest daughter (Lady Caroline) are considered his legal heir, by different parties.|$|E
50|$|In 1647 he {{inherited}} in tail-male the Devon manors of Stevenstone {{in the parish}} of St Giles in the Wood, near Great Torrington (23 miles east of Week St Mary) and Bicton, amongst many others, {{following the death of}} his second cousin Henry Rolle (1605-1647) of Beam, near Great Torrington, the last male descendent of John's great uncle John Rolle of Stevenstone (d. 1570), eldest son of the patriarch George Rolle (d. 1552), the founder of the Devon and Cornwall families. This inheritance made him possibly the largest landowner in Devon, a position certainly held in 1873 by his <b>ultimate</b> adoptive <b>heir</b> Hon. Mark Rolle (d. 1907), of Stevenstone, as revealed by the Return of Owners of Land survey.|$|R
5000|$|Malory later {{ended up}} in custody in Colchester, accused of still more crimes, {{involving}} robbery and the stealing of horses. Once again, he escaped and once again was apprehended and returned to Marshalsea Prison. [...] He was pardoned at the accession of Edward IV in 1461. He was never actually tried {{on any of the}} charges brought against him, except at Nuneaton in 1451. In 1462, Malory settled his estate on his son Robert and, in 1466 or 1467, Robert fathered a son named Nicholas, who was Malory's <b>ultimate</b> <b>heir.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Hatshepsut {{died after}} a 22-year reign and, Thutmose III became pharaoh. At {{the end of}} a thirty-year reign of his own, he entered into a co-regency with a son by a lesser wife who would become, Amenhotep II. Neferure had died without leaving another heir, but there were others in line to become pharaoh, so the co-regency assured that these royal {{offspring}} with closer ties to Hatshepsut would be removed from the line of descent, and Thutmose III's chosen heir would rule. [...] The records of holders of the title, God's Wife of Amun, after Thutmose III became pharaoh deviate from the established pattern, perhaps because of the line of royalty issue. After Neferure the list notes, Iset, the mother of Thutmose III, but it is quite certain that she never officiated, and was awarded the title after her death. Next is, Satiah, a lesser wife of Thutmose III {{in the early part of}} his reign. She is followed by, Merytre-Hatshepsut, another lesser wife of Thutmose III, who became the mother of his <b>ultimate</b> <b>heir.</b> She was the daughter of the Divine Adoratrice of Amun, Huy. Next on the list is, Meritamen, a daughter of Thutmose III and Merytre-Hatshepsut, thereby the sister of his <b>ultimate</b> <b>heir.</b> After all of those changes during his long reign, the office holder was the daughter of Thutmose III, returning to the traditional association.|$|E
50|$|Knut Alvsonn, of the Swedish Tre Rosor noble family, was the {{great-grandson}} of Sigurd Jonson's {{sister and}} his <b>ultimate</b> <b>heir</b> (after Sigurd's own son Hans Sigurdsson had died childless in 1466). He was a Royal Councillor of Norway, and holder of vast landed properties around Norway, having inherited such from his Giske-Bjarkoy-Sudreim ancestors. Knut Alvsonn {{was a personal}} enemy of Lord Henrich Krummedige, Danish royal governor in Norway. That made him somewhat an opponent of the union; {{and he was an}} ally of Sweden's anti-unionist Regent Sten Sture the Elder. Knut Alvsonn is said to have built a basis to grab the Norwegian throne, starting in the late 15th century. He started an open rebellion against King John of Denmark, took some Norwegian castles, but was killed in 1502 by King Johns' minions.|$|E
5000|$|The {{site was}} dismantled, {{and the group}} moved to the current {{location}} in 1980. The land on which it was erected was considered legally as [...] "state land", and therefore eligible for Israeli settlement. This legal interpretation was disputed, the Peace Now lawyers arguing that it constituted abuse of the Ottoman land law, by which common village lands were deemed to be the Sultan's property (whose <b>ultimate</b> <b>heir</b> was the Israeli military government); however, the law {{was not intended to}} give the Sultan the right to alienate the village lands and grant them to people outside the village, and was never so used during the centuries of Ottoman rule, or under the British and Jordanians who maintained the same law. However, in this case, the Supreme Court accepted the state and the settlers' position, and the placing of the Elon Moreh settlers in the new location was upheld.|$|E
50|$|When Henrich was {{elevated}} to similar positions in Norway {{as his father}} had held, he also inherited the family conflict with the influential and wealthy Swedish Tre Rosor noble family.Pro-Swedish Alv Knutsson’s son, Knut Alvsonn, of the family Tre Rosor was Lord of Giske, and Sigurd Jonsson’s <b>ultimate</b> <b>heir.</b> Sigurd, {{the son of the}} Swedish nobleman Jon Marteinsson, was a Norwegian nobleman and knight, and the supreme leader of Norway during two interregnums in the mid-15th century. After the death of King Christopher in 1448 Sigurd Jonsson was offered the vacant throne of Norway, but declined to pursue a claim. Alv was a Royal Councilor of Norway, and holder of vast landed properties around Norway, having inherited land as well as a claim to the throne of Norway from his Giske-Bjarkoy-Sudreim ancestors. Knut Alvson was personal enemy of Lord Henrich Krummedige {{and a member of the}} pro-Swedish faction on the Norwegian National Council. Knut took over Akershus in 1497.|$|E
5000|$|Wee Bin (...) born in China in 1823, was a far-sighted and enterprising Chinese migrant {{of the mid}} {{nineteenth century}} who, in his time, founded, Singapore's largest Chinese {{shipping}} firm. In 1856 {{at the age of}} thirty-three, Wee Bin was founder of Wee Bin & Co. chop Hong Guan, in Market Street, a firm that was rapidly becoming prominent in Singapore in the 1860s' and ran the firm according to Western business practices. Wee Bin through his firm, carried on business as Merchants and Shipowners. He incorporated Western practices in his business. Wee Bin at first began business relations with various houses in Bali in the Dutch Indies, and eventually became the greatest importer of products from that port. He also traded in all kinds of earthenware, and later on built up a fleet of over twenty vessels for the Chinese and Dutch Indies trade. With increasing interest in the tin mining industry and the need for more and more people to work the mines, Wee Bin was also responsible for carrying migrant workers from China to work in the Straits Settlements. Wee Bin married the daughter of Kiong Kong Tuan and died in 1868 at the age of 45, leaving an only son, Wee Boon Teck, and an only daughter who became the wife of Lim Ho Puah who would later take over his firm before passing it on to Wee Bin's <b>ultimate</b> <b>heir,</b> Lim Peng Siang (the fourth son of Lim Ho Puah), one of the greatest Chinese entrepreneurs and capitalists of his time.|$|E
40|$|Justin devotes {{three books}} (VII-IX) of his Epitome {{to the history}} of the kingdom of Macedonia until Philip II’s death. He not only goes over all the main events of the {{biography}} of the sovereign, but he also dwells on his murder, openly accusing Olympias, Alexander’s mother, of having been the organizer of the conspiracy. At the end of book IX, Justin gives us a moral portrait of Philip, built through a direct comparison with that of his son Alexander. This comparison ends underlining that they were the "creators" of the great empire of the Macedonians. Even from the Epitome of Justin it comes out how great importance Trogus Pompey had given to the figure of Philip II. To his name it is easy to associate the title of the original work, Historiae Philippicae, a title which the historian borrowed from Theopompus of Chios’ work. Thanks to the deeds of Philip II (and later of his son Alexander), Macedonia is fully inserted in the evolutionary scheme of the so-called translatio imperii, which, according to the communis opinio of modern scholars, is the load-bearing structure of Pompeius Trogus’ work. In this structure, however, the position of Rome is not clear: Rome is never explicitly celebrated as the <b>ultimate</b> <b>heir</b> of the universal empire. This circumstance raised a number of discussions among modern scholars, without arriving eventually to a commonly accepted opinion. But beyond any judgment on the position of Trogus towards the imperium populi Romani, it is undeniable that in his historiographical work the largest space is devoted to the empire of the Macedonians: of this empire Philip II had been the real founde...|$|E
