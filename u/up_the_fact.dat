25|$|This trend only {{lasted for}} a couple months, however, when support for Congresswoman Michele Bachmann began to increase, {{due in large part}} to the support she was able to garner through the Tea Party movement, of which she is a {{founding}} member of the Tea Party Caucus in the United States House of Representatives.

25|$|Lehman's {{classification}} {{was developed}} by Abraham Gottlob Werner who thought that rock strata had been deposited from a primeval global ocean rather than by Noah's Flood, a doctrine called Neptunism. The idea of a young Earth was further undermined in 1774 by Nicolas Desmarest, whose studies of a succession of extinct volcanoes in Europe showed layers which would have taken long ages to build <b>up.</b> <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> that these layers were still intact indicated that any later Flood had been local rather than universal. Against Neptunism, James Hutton proposed an indefinitely old cycle of eroded rocks being deposited in the sea, consolidated and heaved up by volcanic forces into mountains which in turn eroded, all in natural processes which continue to operate.|$|E

25|$|Codreanu {{clashed with}} Cuza over the League's structure: he demanded that it develop a {{paramilitary}} and revolutionary character, while Cuza was {{hostile to the}} idea. In November, while in Văcărești prison in Bucharest, Codreanu had planned {{for the creation of}} a youth organization within the League, which he aimed to call The Legion of the Archangel Michael. This was said to be in honor of an Orthodox icon that adorned the walls of the prison church, or, more specifically, linked to Codreanu's reported claim of having been visited by the Archangel himself. A more personal problem also divided Codreanu and Cuza, namely that Cuza's son had an affair with Codreanu's sister that left her pregnant. The couple had broken up with the younger Cuza refused his girlfriend's demand that he marry her now that she was bearing his child. Though the scandal was hushed <b>up,</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that his sister was having an illegitimate child was deeply humiliating for Codreanu as he liked to present his family as model members of the Orthodox church and he sought unsuccessfully to have Cuza pressure his son to marry his sister.|$|E

Sonya agrees to wait for Toadie, and they begin dating again.|$|E

To help ease his problems, he transfers $100,000 from the Lassiter's Corporation into the PirateNet accounts and tells his wife, Rebecca, {{that it is}} from an anonymous benefactor. Rebecca's son, Declan, believes Paul has been embezzling money from Lassiter's and contacts Diana Marshall about his suspicions.

500|$|First season regular {{cast member}} Malcolm David Kelley {{returned}} in an uncredited cameo {{for a single}} scene as Michael's ten-year-old son Walt without dialogue and from a distance. Fifteen-year-old Kelley claimed that make-up was applied to him in an effort for him to look younger; however, Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse clarified that visual effects supervisor Mitch Suskin had actually composited into the shot some footage of Kelley from production on the first season. Because Kelley was so obscured and his name did {{not appear in the}} cast list, television critics were convinced that Walt had been recast. Steve Heisler of Time Out stated that [...] "You gotta hand it to the Lost writers: For weeks, people have speculated about how they were going to treat Walt's inevitable pubescence. See, the show's set in 2004, and only a few months have passed since the plane crash. Yet … it's been years, and … Kelley has become a man. So what did they do? … They just didn't show him. Clever." [...] TMZ's Daniel thought that [...] "Not showing Walt is a clever way to cover <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that he [...] a foot taller than he should be … I understand that they pretty much can't show Walt ever again".

He joked [...] "somewhere out there, there's an extraterrestrial that's doing this to us, I guess." [...] At the close of the debate, Perot described himself as [...] "results... action oriented", and explained that [...] "if they want to keep slow dancing and talk about it and not do it, I'm not your man." [...] Perot took part in the third debate held in East Lansing, Michigan, on October 19. Throughout the debate, he plugged and referenced his infomercials. He criticized Bush's economic plan to start off the debate, stating that it would not balance the budget. He later remarked that he would spend $60 {{million of his own money}} to finish the race. Notably, Perot brought <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that [...] "both parties have foreign lobbyists on leaves and key roles in the campaigns." [...] After the debate, he ripped the media during a press conference, criticizing them for their use of [...] "gotcha" [...] stories and the lack of coverage concerning his opponent's foreign lobbyists.
