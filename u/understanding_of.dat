40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we report}} on an {{investigation}} into initial teacher education students (ITES) <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> sustainability and the Australian National Curriculum Sustainability Cross Curricular Priority (CCP). We also explore their willingness and capacities to embed the CCP into their own teaching practices. The ITESs (N= 392) completed a quantitative survey {{with a series of}} Likert Scale questions and were asked to list “ 5 words” when they think of sustainability. Analysis reveals that ITESs have generally limited to moderate <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> sustainability and education for sustainability, but lesser <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> the Sustainability CCP and the 9 organising ideas. <b>Understandings</b> <b>of</b> sustainability were dominated by an environmental focus. We conclude this paper with a discussion of the implications <b>of</b> narrow environmental <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> sustainability. We explore factors that limit and enable teacher educators to embed sustainability education more explicitly. We note the importance role teacher educators play in supporting ITESs to better understand sustainability...|$|R

5|$|Evidence of {{abstract}} thinking {{can be seen}} in the archaeological record as early as the Acheulean-Middle Stone Age transition, approximately 300,000-250,000 years ago. This transition involves a shift in stone tool technology from Mode 2, Acheulean tools, to Mode 3 and 4, which include blades and microliths. The manufacture of these tools requires planning and the <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> how striking a stone will produce different flaking patterns. This requires abstract thought, one of the hallmarks of modern human behavior. The shift from large cutting tools in the Acheulian to smaller and more diversified toolkits in the MSA represents a better cognitive and conceptual <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> flintknapping, as well as the potential functional effects of distinct tool types.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to these materialistic views, Aristotelianism considered all natural things as actualisations of fixed natural possibilities, known as forms.

Variations of this idea became the standard <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the Middle Ages and were integrated into Christian learning, but Aristotle did not demand that real types of organisms always correspond one-for-one with exact metaphysical forms and specifically gave examples of how new types of living things could come to be.|$|E

Institutional autonomy has been {{ratified by the}} government, however, in practice universities seem to have little control over curriculum. In order for universities to develop more ownership of curriculum, {{it is necessary to}} explore the foundational <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> curriculum held by stakeholders. Thus, this paper explores the <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> curriculum expressed by a group of senior staff, academics and students at a Vietnamese university. We found a diversity <b>of</b> <b>understandings</b> that tended to be product-focused, teacher-focused and textbook-driven.
