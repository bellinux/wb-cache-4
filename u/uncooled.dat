500|$|Before {{and during}} World War I, the gun used about [...] of RP C/12 (Rohr-Pulver– tube powder) {{propellant}} {{that was a}} mix of nitrocellulose, nitroglycerin and small amounts of other additives with a calorific value of 950 and an <b>uncooled</b> explosion temperature of 2975 [...] kelvins. In World War II, it was replaced by RP C/38 that substituted diethylene glucol dinitrite for the nitroglycerine which had a calorific value of 810 and an <b>uncooled</b> explosion temperature of 2495 K. This had the virtue of being harder to ignite, lessening {{the risk of a}} catastrophic fire or explosion, and reduced the erosive effects of the gaseous propellant on the gun's bore. Sources differ on the amount of RP C/38 used by the gun during World War II; Campbell says , but Hogg says [...]|$|E
2500|$|Production {{started in}} 1992 with the 1900lbf (8.45kN) thrust FJ44-1A, which {{comprises}} a 20.9 in (531mm) diameter single stage blisk fan plus a single intermediate pressure (IP) booster stage, {{driven by a}} 2 stage low pressure (LP) turbine, supercharging a single stage centrifugal high pressure (HP) compressor, driven by a single stage <b>uncooled</b> high pressure (HP) turbine. The combustor is an impingement cooled annular design. [...] Fuel is delivered to the combustor through an unusual rotating fuel nozzle system, rather than the standard fuel-air mixers or vapourisers. The bypass duct runs the full length the engine. Specific fuel consumption at 1900lbf (8.45kN) thrust at SLS, ISA is understood to be 0.456lb/(hr lbf). A derated version, the 1500lbf (6.67kN) thrust FJ44-1C has an SFC of 0.460lb/(hr lbf).|$|E

60|$|They passed on, {{after looking}} at the axle for a few minutes, until {{they came to a}} part of the {{building}} where rails were being forged. This also, although not done by hammer, was a striking process. The place was so hot owing to the quantity of <b>uncooled</b> metal on the floor, that {{it was not possible to}} remain long; they therefore took a rapid survey. In one place several men were in the act of conveying to the steam-hammer a mass of shapeless white-hot iron, which had just been plucked from a furnace with a pair of grippers. They put it below the hammer for a few minutes, which soon reduced it to a clumsy bar; then they carried it to a pair of iron rollers driven by steam. The end of the bar being presented to these, it was gripped, dragged in between them, and passed out at the other side, flat and very much lengthened, as well as thinned. Having been further reduced by this process, it was finally passed through a pair of rollers, which gave it shape, and sent it out a complete rail, ready to be laid down on the line.|$|E

Only very hot objects emit strongly at such short wavelengths, limiting heat-seeking systems using <b>uncooled</b> PbS detector elements to rear-hemisphere engagements against jet targets, although propeller-driven aircraft and helicopters can of course be engaged from any direction from which the exhaust or other very hot parts of the engine are visible.|$|E
