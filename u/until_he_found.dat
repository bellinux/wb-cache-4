5|$|A counterattack to {{take back}} the {{airfield}} and Point 107 was organised for the following day at Hargest's headquarters. He was exhausted and had to take a quick nap before a conference to work out detailed plans for the counter-attack, much to the disgust of some of the other participants.

The attack did fail but Hargest, still well behind the frontlines, mistakenly believed it to be going well <b>until</b> <b>he</b> <b>found</b> that his brigade had returned to their starting positions. His pessimism began to affect Puttick, who asked Freyberg to allow the 5th Infantry Brigade to withdraw, which it duly did. This began an eventual retreat and evacuation from Crete on 31 May, with Hargest flying out for Egypt by seaplane, his brigade following by sea.|$|E

25|$|Level design {{began with}} what {{designer}} Michael Stuart Licht {{referred to as}} spatial studies. Design began with paper cut outs of various rooms. Licht would rearrange these rooms <b>until</b> <b>he</b> <b>found</b> a design that he felt worked. The papers had design ideas written on them so that other developers could understand the overall flow of each level. Bubble diagrams were then created which represented main ideas for each space. This was followed by various stages of overview drawings and other drawing studies. 3D level design began after such studies were completed. In-game cinematics were created by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), and marked the first collaboration between LucasArts and ILM. Composer Jeremy Soule wrote music for the game, including both cut scenes and gameplay. The characters Jango Fett and Komari Vosa have their own leitmotifs.
