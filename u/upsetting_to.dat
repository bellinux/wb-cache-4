5|$|The film's dubbing {{activities}} {{began on}} 15 December 2011 at Shabdalaya Studios in Hyderabad. The DTS mixing works were in progress in early January 2012. The Central Board of Film Certification passed the film with an 'A' certificate; board members found {{few of the}} film's dialogues offensive and potentially <b>upsetting</b> <b>to</b> the people of Mumbai.|$|E
5|$|His regents, Armansperg and Rundhart, {{established}} a controversial policy of suppressing the monasteries. This was very <b>upsetting</b> <b>to</b> the Church hierarchy. Russia was self-considered as stalwart defender of Orthodoxy but Orthodox believers {{were found in}} all three parties. Once he rid himself of his Bavarian advisers, Otto allowed the statutory dissolution of the monasteries to lapse.|$|E
5|$|Skirth {{gave the}} memoir to his {{daughter}} Jean in 1975, two years {{before his death in}} 1977 Although for many years she found it too <b>upsetting</b> <b>to</b> read in full, she felt that it was a story that should be shared with others, and in 1999 she donated four of the five ring binders, containing the bulk of the memoir but excluding its more personal sections, to the Imperial War Museum in London, where they remain to this day.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{receiving}} the package on April 18, 2007, NBC contacted authorities {{and made the}} controversial decision to publicize Cho's communications by releasing {{a small fraction of}} what it received. After pictures and images from the videos were broadcast in numerous news reports, students and faculty from Virginia Tech, along with relatives of victims of the campus shooting, expressed concerns that glorifying Cho's rampage could lead to copycat killings. The airing of the manifesto and its video images and pictures was <b>upsetting</b> <b>to</b> many who were more closely affected by the shootings: Peter Read, the father of Mary Read, one of the students who was killed by Cho during the rampage, asked the media to stop airing Cho's manifesto.|$|E
25|$|Native Americans {{view the}} whiteshaman {{with a mix}} of humor and contempt. It is not just the simple act of going outside their culture that is <b>upsetting</b> <b>to</b> Native Americans, but that they are misrepresenting the true Indian culture (their images are shadows of the true Indian style). Rose is opposed to the idea that through reading and hearing about Indian culture anyone can simply claim to be a {{spokesperson}} for the Native American experience.|$|E
25|$|Although the show's {{writers and}} {{producers}} received a minimal negative reaction from Willow choosing Tara over Oz, {{the response from}} viewers and critics alike was overwhelming towards Whedon for killing Tara, accusing him of homophobia. Particularly because Tara's death came {{at a point where}} Willow and Tara had reconciled and were shown following an apparent sexual encounter, the writers were criticized for representing the consequences of lesbian sex as punishable by death. Series writer and producer Marti Noxon—whose mother fell in love with another woman when Noxon was 13 years old—was unable to read some of the mail the writing team received because it was so <b>upsetting.</b> <b>To</b> her, the pain expressed in viewers' letters was a logical reaction to the lack of realistic lesbian role models on television.|$|E

25|$|Isabella was {{at first}} {{unprepared}} for the lavish style of court life in Burgundy, {{one of the most}} extravagant in Europe. The Portuguese infanta, described by the Burgundian embassy that had negotiated her marriage as appearing to their eyes as a nun when they had first met, and now dressed in loose clothing and flat over-panels to hide her pregnancy, looked particularly dowdy at her new court. More <b>upsetting</b> <b>to</b> Isabella, however, was her husband's behaviour. He had showered gifts on her when she had first arrived, and still more when she had become pregnant; yet, {{he made it clear that}} he had no intention of keeping his vows of fidelity and chastity. He kept numerous women as his lovers, most living away from the court, and as many as 50 illegitimate children.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Letterkenny {{represented}} Ireland in the Entente Florale, having scooped Gold in the Large Urban Centre {{category of}} the 2007 National Tidy Town Awards. Locally there was a minor furore as all flags of competing nations were displayed in prominent areas of the town, with some difficulty encountered when locals discovered the controversial Union Jack flag hanging from a pole adjacent {{to the library and}} Paddy Delap's newsagent. The flag is still <b>upsetting</b> <b>to</b> many people angered by continuing British rule in Northern Ireland and as such led to an intensely heated debate on local radio station Highland Radio on the day the judges were in town. The flag was first mounted the previous day (7 August) and had to be taken down when some concerns were raised about its safety on a busy Thursday night. It was remounted the following day. Nevertheless the town won gold in the competition.|$|E

500|$|Horse colic {{itself is}} not a disease, but rather a {{description}} of symptoms connected to abdominal pain. [...] It can occur due to any number of digestive upsets, from mild bloating due to excess intestinal gas to life-threatening impactions. Colic is most often caused by a change in diet, either a planned change that takes place too quickly, or an accidental change, such as a horse getting out of its barn or paddock and ingesting unfamiliar plants. But colic has many other possible triggers including insufficient water, an irregular feeding schedule, stress, and illness. [...] Because the horse cannot vomit and has a limited capacity to detoxify harmful substances, anything <b>upsetting</b> <b>to</b> the horse must travel {{all the way through}} the digestive system to be expelled.|$|E
500|$|Following the show's {{cancellation}} in 2002, Rogen did not {{get many}} auditions, which was not <b>upsetting</b> <b>to</b> him as he always thought he would achieve better success as a writer. He would soon {{be a part of}} Apatow's [...] "frat pack", a close-knit group that includes Steve Carell and Paul Rudd. Of the awkwardness of a grown man spending so much time with a teenaged Rogen, Apatow said: [...] "I'm such a comedy fan that, even though he's16, I know I'm hanging out with one of the guys who's {{going to be one of}} the great comics." [...] Around this time, Apatow would come up with odd requests for Rogen and Goldberg, such as turn an idea of his into a movie in 10 days and come up with 100 one-page ideas for films. Regarding Apatow's professional effect on Rogen, the actor said in 2009, [...] "Obviously, I can't stress how important Judd's been to my career".|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} 1894, Grove {{retired from}} the Royal College of Music. Parry was chosen to succeed him, and {{although}} Stanford wholeheartedly congratulated his friend on his appointment, their relations soon deteriorated. Stanford {{was known as a}} hot-tempered and quarrelsome man. Grove had written of a board meeting at the Royal College [...] "where somehow the spirit of the d----l himself had been working in Stanford all the time – as it sometimes does, making him so nasty and quarrelsome and contradictious as no one but he can be! He is a most remarkably clever and able fellow, full of resource and power – no doubt of that – but one has to purchase it often at a very dear price." [...] Parry suffered worse at Stanford's hands with frequent rows, deeply <b>upsetting</b> <b>to</b> the highly strung Parry. Some of their rows were caused by Stanford's reluctance to accept the authority of his old friend and protégé, but on other occasions Parry seriously provoked Stanford, notably in 1895 when he reduced the funding for Stanford's orchestral classes.|$|E

500|$|Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps {{said that}} the {{relationship}} [...] "hasn’t worked out or caught fire through the writing, or with the fans watching on-screen!" [...] In August 2012, Victor and Sharon married a second time, and when he disappeared shortly after, {{she thought he was}} abandoning her. Sharon later burned their prenuptial agreement, and took over this company. Talking about the situation, Case stated that the writers could have done this storyline [...] "a million other ways" [...] without [...] "marrying him [...] ". In another interview, she spoke thoroughly of the relationship, labeling it incestuous. She stated: [...] "Sometimes controversial storylines can work because you're bringing attention to a controversial issue that the nation is trying to decide on. But this was not one of those things. Everybody is universally against incest! It was just so <b>upsetting</b> <b>to</b> the audience. Whenever the actors went to do , the fans would bring it up. Literally, every actor in the building was coming up to me, giving me feedback that they were getting about it!" [...] When asked if the marriage was about [...] "daddy issues", Case said: [...] "That's usually the case in a story like that, but I don't think it's one most people want to watch!" [...] Victor later returned home and annulled their second marriage. During an interview with The Province, Michael Muhney, who portrays Victor's son Adam, said that Victor and Sharon's marriage was [...] "almost like an inside joke".|$|E
500|$|It's {{something}} that's {{very difficult}} for me. Because it is lines on paper when I {{do it in the}} comic book series. It's like, 'Oh, okay, Charlie Adlard [...] doesn’t have to draw that arrangement of lines anymore, that person is dead.' But it's very uncomfortable for me to be on set, because I see these actors that are there and, in the source material, I have killed all but two of them. I walk through the set and I'm like, 'Yep, killed that one, killed that one, killed that one.' And it is firing those people. I feel really bad for Emma Bell, just because she was great and I {{would have liked to have}} had her in the show. But, you know, this is The Walking Dead, characters have got to die. Thankfully, Emma was brought onto the show with the understanding that she was only going to be in a certain number of episodes and she knew that she was going to die from the very beginning. But it doesn’t really make it any easier. When they were shooting those scenes, I had to fly to Comic-Con and so I wasn’t actually there for when she died. But it was very emotional on set and I know that she was very upset about having to leave the crew and the actors. You kind of become a family when you're doing a TV show and it’s a little <b>upsetting</b> <b>to</b> have to get rid of somebody.|$|E
500|$|In 1991, Mirkin wrote a pilot with Julie Brown {{entitled}} The Julie Show, starring Brown, but NBC did {{not produce}} it. Several people at the network enjoyed it and commissioned The Edge, a sketch comedy show also written by Mirkin and Brown, with Mirkin directing. NBC opted against production, but Fox ran it from 1992 to 1993. Mirkin had long wished to produce a sketch show, and designed The Edge to be [...] "fast-paced" [...] and [...] "some skits overlap, end abruptly or are broken into segments", {{in order to maintain}} attention. The Edge was a ratings success and was supported by the network. Mirkin considered it [...] "the first time I experienced the feeling of having a hit that I created. It just kept building and growing." [...] The show's material often inflamed its targets, particularly producer Aaron Spelling. Spelling objected to a sketch mocking his series Beverly Hills, 90210, another Fox show, and its lead actress Tori Spelling, who is his daughter. He demanded a public apology and that no further episodes contain the parody, threatening to sue. The show's production company TriStar Television refused, while Mirkin responded: [...] "The thing about these parodies is they don't hurt a show. It's only cross-promotion. The viewers who like the show always come back the next week. What's <b>upsetting</b> <b>to</b> me is it shows absolutely that Mr. Spelling has no sense of humor." [...] Mirkin left his role as executive producer of The Edge during its run. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that Mirkin had been [...] "forced off the show", due to the negative reaction of Spelling and others, though in 2012, Mirkin stated that he left the series after refusing to accept a substantially reduced budget. The show's producers Sony failed to persuade him to stay but he returned to the series to produce its final [...] "Best Of" [...] compilation.|$|E

2500|$|She {{appeared}} in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix {{in which she}} and Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) shared an on-screen kiss that received much media coverage. Her role was significant in the series at this point as Harry Potter's first romance. While Leung was greeted warmly by most fans of the series, some Potter fans, jealous of Leung's relationship with Harry in the film, created a [...] "I Hate Katie" [...] website and racist messages posted on fan websites were <b>upsetting</b> <b>to</b> Leung at the time.|$|E
2500|$|A {{member of}} the Brown family {{released}} {{a statement saying that}} [...] "the stealing and breaking in stores is not what Mike will want, it is very <b>upsetting</b> <b>to</b> me and my family."

[...] On the night of the grand jury decision of a 'no true bill' the mother speaking to the crowd expressed disbelief and innocence, but after a brief silence and then sobbing was embraced by the step-father who promoted arson.|$|E
