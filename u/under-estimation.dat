The military situation is without doubt at this moment most grave and critical. We have been at war three weeks. The army that was to have defended Natal, and was indeed expected to repulse the invaders with terrible loss, is blockaded and bombarded in its fortified camp. At nearly every point along the circle of the frontiers the Boers have advanced and the British retreated. Wherever we have stood we have been surrounded. The losses in the fighting have not been unequal--nor, considering the numbers engaged and the weapons employed, have they been very severe. But the Boers hold more than 1,200 unwounded British prisoners, a number that bears a disgraceful proportion to the casualty lists, and a very unsatisfactory relation {{to the number of}} Dutchmen that we have taken. All this is mainly the result of being unready. That we are unready is largely due to those in England who have endeavoured by every means in their power to hamper and obstruct the Government, who have scoffed at the possibility of the Boers becoming the aggressors, and who have represented every precaution for the defence of the colonies as a deliberate provocation to the Transvaal State. It is also due to an extraordinary <b>under-estimation</b> of the strength of the Boers. These military republics have been for ten years cherishing vast ambitions, and for five years, enriched by the gold mines, they have been arming and preparing for the struggle. They have neglected nothing, and it is a very remarkable fact that these ignorant peasant communities have had the wisdom and the enterprise to possess themselves of good advisers, and to utilise the best expert opinion in all matters of armament and war.|$|E

Measurements with the BVI 6200 were compared to measurements with a graduated cylinder or with conventional ultrasound before and after micturition. All volumes were expressed in milliliters. The measured volumes were compared {{to each other in}} a Bland-Altman analysis. Results: Mean (bias) of the different measurements fell within 10 % difference of measurements.

Both calcified structures presented observable growth bands, allowing cross comparison among structures {{for the first}} time in a shark species.

However, inter-reader growth band count plots showed possible biases in counts from sectioned vertebrae and sectioned dorsal-fin spines. Sectioned vertebrae and whole and sectioned dorsal-fin spines produced similar growth band counts, whereas whole vertebrae produced significantly lower counts. The similar readability, precision indices, growth band counts and apparent absence of biases between counts for a single reader would indicate that sectioned vertebrae and whole and sectioned dorsal-fin spines are both potentially useful and acceptable methods for band counting.

40|$|Black holes (BHs) are {{believed}} to be a key ingredient of galaxy formation. However, the galaxy-BH interplay is challenging to study due to the large dynamical range and complex physics involved. As a consequence, hydrodynamical cosmological simulations normally adopt sub-grid models to track the unresolved physical processes, in particular BH accretion; usually the spatial scale where the BH dominates the hydrodynamical processes (the Bondi radius) is unresolved, and an approximate Bondi-Hoyle accretion rate is used to estimate the growth of the BH. By comparing hydrodynamical simulations at different resolutions (300, 30, 3 pc) using a Bondi-Hoyle approximation to sub-parsec runs with non-parameterized accretion, our aim is to probe how well an approximated Bondi accretion is able to capture the BH accretion physics and the subsequent feedback on the galaxy. We analyse an isolated galaxy simulation that includes cooling, star formation, Type Ia and Type II supernovae, BH accretion and AGN feedback (radiation pressure, Compton heating/cooling) where mass, momentum, and energy are deposited in the interstellar medium through conical winds. We find that on average the approximated Bondi formalism can lead to both over- and <b>under-estimations</b> of the BH growth, depending on resolution and on how the variables entering into the Bondi-Hoyle formalism are calculated.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method {{for improving the}} assessment of energy and resources of waves {{in the cases of}} finite water depths in which the historical and some ongoing sea wave measurements are simply given in forms of scatter diagrams or the forms of (significant) wave heights and the relevant statistical wave periods, whilst the detailed spectrum information has been discarded, thus no longer available for the purpose of analysis. As a result of such simplified wave data, the assessment for embracing the effects of water depths on wave energy and resources becomes either difficult or inaccurate. In many practical cases, the effects of water depths are simply ignored because the formulas for deep-water waves are frequently employed. This simplification may cause large energy <b>under-estimations</b> for the sea waves in finite water depths. To improve the wave energy assessment for such much-simplified wave data, an approximate method is proposed for approximating the effect of water depth in this research, for which the wave energy period or the calculated peak period can be taken as the reference period for implementing the approximation. The examples for both theoretical and measured spectra show that the proposed method can significantly reduce the errors on wave energy assessment due to the approximations and inclusions of the effects of finite water depths...|$|R

Concentrations of nitrate and nitrite were decreased during the storm event, whereas all other pollutants generally increased and exceeded environmental limits where specified, especially when associated with a small subsidiary hydrograph on the rising limb of the main hydrograph.

Method: Participants (age range 7. 1 - 14. 1 years) performed a time reproduction task. A subset of the ADHD group was also tested on the Sustained Attention to Response Test. Absolute discrepancy, accuracy coefficient, and intraindividual variability scores on the time reproduction task were compared across the three groups (ADHD-C: N = 20; ADHD-I: N = 19; controls: N = 44) and correlated with the Sustained Attention to Response Test. Results: First, significantly better performance was observed in matched controls than in children with ADHD on the time reproduction task. Second, {{there was a significant difference}} between the two ADHD subtypes in the variability of the size of errors made at high time intervals (36 - 60 seconds). Third, intraindividual performance variability in the direction (over- versus <b>under-estimations)</b> of time reproductions correlated with sustained attention performance. Conclusions: Children with ADHD varied more in the size and direction of their time reproduction errors than control children. Those with ADHD-C demonstrated more intraindividual variability than did those with ADHD-I in the size of their errors. The data provide support for a relationship between sustained attention and time reproduction.

40|$|Optimal {{distribution}} of power among generating units to meet a specific demand subject to system constraints is an ongoing research topic in the power system community. The problem, even in a static setting, {{turns out to be}} hard to solve with conventional optimization methods owing to the consideration of valve-point effects which make the cost function nonsmooth and nonconvex. This difficulty gave rise to the proliferation of population-based global heuristics in order to address the multi-extremal and nonsmooth problem. In this paper, we address the economic load dispatch problem (ELDP) with valve-point effect in its classic formulation where the cost function for each generator is expressed as the sum of a quadratic term and a rectified sine term. We propose two methods that resort to piecewise-quadratic surrogate cost functions, yielding surrogate problems that can be handled by mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) solvers. The first method shows that the global solution of the ELDP can often be found by using a fixed and very limited number of quadratic pieces in the surrogate cost function. The second method adaptively builds piecewise-quadratic surrogate <b>under-estimations</b> of the ELDP cost function, yielding a sequence of surrogate MIQP problems. It is shown that any limit point of the sequence of MIQP solutions is a global solution of the ELDP. Moreover, numerical experiments indicate that the proposed methods outclass the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of minimization value and computation time on practical instances.

40|$|Modern food {{production}} is very diverse {{with high levels}} of specialisation and complexity. These features inevitably reflect on methods in the application of LCA to food products and agro-systems. System boundaries, functional units, allocation procedures and several other aspects contribute to there being substantial differentiation in the structure of LCA applications in fruit production systems, leading to significantly different results. Indeed, although scientific literature on the topic is recent and not particularly extensive, there are already many different ways of conducting LCAs in orchards. The aim {{of this paper is to}} propose a framework for selecting the best parameters for an LCA application in fruit production systems according to the objective of the study.

A substantial part of the paper is devoted to the modelling of the orchard, as this is key to a reliable application of any impact assessment approach.

40|$|Functional {{connectivity}} {{studies conducted}} at the group level using magnetoencephalography (MEG) suggest that resting state networks (RSNs) emerge from the large-scale envelope correlation structure within spontaneous oscillatory brain activity. However, {{little is known about}} the consistency of MEG RSNs at the individual level. This paper investigates the inter- and intra-subject variability of three MEG RSNs (sensorimotor, auditory and visual) using seed-based source space envelope correlation analysis applied to 5  min of resting state MEG data acquired from a 306 -channel whole-scalp neuromagnetometer (Elekta Oy, Helsinki, Finland) and source projected with minimum norm estimation. The main finding is that these three MEG RSNs exhibit substantial variability at the single-subject level across and within individuals, which depends on the RSN type, but can be reduced after averaging over subjects or sessions. Over- and <b>under-estimations</b> of true RSNs variability are respectively obtained using template seeds, which are potentially mislocated due to inter-subject variations, and a seed optimization method minimizing variability. In particular, bounds on the minimal number of subjects or sessions required to obtain highly consistent between- or within-subject averages of MEG RSNs are derived. Furthermore, MEG RSN topography positively correlates with their mean connectivity at the inter-subject level. These results indicate that MEG RSNs associated with primary cortices can be robustly extracted from seed-based envelope correlation and adequate averaging. MEG thus appears to be a valid technique to compare RSNs across subjects or conditions, at least when using the current methods. JOURNAL ARTICLESCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

The objectives of this research were to: (i) study the spatial variability of bulk density (ρb), total porosity (θt), clay content (CC), electrical conductivity (EC), and pH in the upper Mākaha Valley watershed soils; (ii) explore the effect of variations in ρb and θt on soil water content dynamics, and (iii) establish field calibration equations for EC- 20 (Decagon Devices, Inc), ML 2 x (Delta-T-Devices), and SM 200 (Delta-T-Devices) sensors {{to mitigate the effect}} of soil spatial variability on their performance. The studied soil properties except pH varied significantly (P < 0. 05) across the soil water content monitoring depths (20 and 80 cm) and six locations. There was a linear positive and a linear inverse correlation between the soil water content at sampling and ρb, and between the soil water content at sampling and θt, respectively. Values of laboratory measured actual θt correlated (r = 0. 75) with those estimated from the relationship θt = 1 − ρb/ρs, where ρs is the particle density. Variations in the studied soil properties affected {{the performance of}} the default equations of the three tested sensors; they showed substantial <b>under-estimations</b> of the actual water content.

In conclusion, the sensors used in this study need site-specific calibrations in order to mitigate the effects of varying properties of the highly weathered tropical soils...|$|R
