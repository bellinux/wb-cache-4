500|$|In 2017, Getzlaf {{was named}} {{a finalist for the}} Mark Messier Leadership Award along with Calgary Flames defencemen Mark Giordano and Columbus Blue Jackets forward Nick Foligno. In the 2017 playoffs, Getzlaf surpassed former {{teammate}} Teemu Selänne's franchise record of 35 playoff goals against the Edmonton Oilers in Game 4 of the best of seven series. During the Western Conference finals, Getzlaf was fined $10,000 for using a homophobic slur to insult an on-ice official. He later said, [...] "That's my responsibility to understand that there are eyes and ears on <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> Fortunately enough, nobody heard it. If you can read lips, it's a little bit harder, and I apologize for that. That's a thing that you won't hear from me again. I hope I didn't offend anybody outside the circle that we trust." ...|$|E
500|$|A soldier {{under the}} command of Colonel Garnons Williams wrote an account of his {{commanding}} officer's death, which puts the date of his death as 27 September. Col Garnons Williams was in temporary command of the 12th Royal Fusiliers when on 25 September he led his battalion in an attack on German trenches. However, the flanks were exposed and on 27 September, Garnons Williams gave the order to retreat. He was at that moment shot in the head from a house nearby. The soldier who gave the account said: [...] "I was very sorry for him, as we could not have had a better, braver officer. He was with <b>us</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> in the front trench, and looked after us as well as he could; no man could have done better. Nobody could get back to him." [...] The following evening, the battalion was relieved, Garnons Williams being declared officially wounded and missing in action, unofficially reported killed.|$|E

5000|$|Captain Elder {{acted as}} a witness in Whitlocke´s court-martial after the failure on {{invasion}} of Buenos Aires. During the confusion of that day one of us received an order from the fiery Craufurd to shoot the traitor dead if we could {{see him in the}} battle, many others of the Rifles receiving the same order from that fine and chivalrous officer. The unfortunate issue of the Buenos Ayres affair is matter of history, and I have nothing to say about it; but I well remember the impression that it made upon <b>us</b> <b>all</b> at <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> and that Sir John Moore was present at Whitelocke's court-martial; General Craufurd and, I think, General Auchmuty, Captain Elder of the Rifles, Captain Dickson, and one of our privates being witnesses.

500|$|Critical {{reception}} {{elsewhere in}} Latin America was also enthusiastic.

[...] And her conclusion stresses the book's Latin American qualities, arguing that it [...] "enchants us, stirs us, moves us, and softens <b>us</b> <b>all</b> at <b>the</b> same <b>time,</b> producing much <b>the</b> same effect as when we travel, eyes and heart wide open, around these Latin American lands or the pages that tell their history." ...|$|R

40|$|We {{are living}} in a society, which is known like the society of knowledge.

About a fact, that the state considers the adult education to be more and more important shows an increasing interest in education policy and also the involvement of the state in the education program presented by international organizations. The adult education becomes to be known like the part of lifelong learning. Still more the people in our society would like to learn and develop self and thereby they are creating the space for developing the other subsystem of the education system - adult education. Lot of us meets the further education during the career when we finished the school. The organizations know, that the investment in knowledge can guarantee the lead before the competition. The learning organization is an ideal model of the education in a company. It is economic and effective model of the education. The concept of the learning organization prefers active learning of the new piece of knowledge before the earlier primary but more passive process - learning by teaching...|$|R
40|$|The rapid {{development}} {{of technology in}} the last decades caused an extreme growth {{in the amount of}} available information. We live in an era, where information whirls around <b>us</b> almost <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> thus it is becoming increasingly difficult to have a clear notion about the world and keep track of what is going on. Media realise this development and they are forced to react. One of such reactions is {{the emergence of a new}} trend in journalism called data journalism. "Data-driven journalism" is principally based on thorough and critical analysis of various amounts and types of data, and its goal is to reveal new insights. Insights about data which might be key for complex understanding of social phenomena in the 21 st century. This paper presents data journalism as a unique field of journalistic work, it defines data journalism and describes some of the processes that lead to creating its output. The practical part of the paper presents its own data journalism project, which attempts for an original analysis and visualisation of the Czech Trade Inspection open data sources.
