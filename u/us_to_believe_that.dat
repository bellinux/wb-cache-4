25|$|With {{the conquest}} of Italy, {{prepared}} viae were extended from Rome and its vicinity to outlying municipalities, sometimes overlying earlier roads. Building viae was a military responsibility and thus came {{under the jurisdiction of}} a consul. The process had a military name, viam munire, as though the via were a fortification. Municipalities, however, were responsible for their own roads, which the Romans called viae vicinales. The beauty and grandeur of the roads might tempt <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> any Roman citizen could use them for free, but this was not the case. Tolls abounded, especially at bridges. Often they were collected at the city gate. Freight costs were made heavier still by import and export taxes. These were only the charges for using the roads. Costs of services on the journey went up from there.|$|E

[...] Zorro exceeded Roger Ebert's expectations, who was surprised by the screenplay's display of traditional film craftsmanship.

After the story appeared in April 1985 and revealed the flawed methods of the Lucas Task Force, law enforcement opinion began to turn against the claims that crimes had been solved. [...] The bulk of the Lucas Report was devoted to a detailed timeline of Lucas's claimed murders. The report compared Lucas's claims to reliable, verifiable sources for his whereabouts; the results often contradicted his confessions, and thus cast doubt on most of the crimes in which he was implicated. Attorney General Jim Mattox wrote that [...] "when Lucas was confessing to hundreds of murders, those with custody of Lucas did nothing {{to bring an end to}} this hoax" [...] and [...] "We have found information that would lead <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> some officials 'cleared cases' just to get them off the books".|$|E

Some of the poems are conversational in which the poet pleads, begs, chides or praises the king. One such example is poem 46.
