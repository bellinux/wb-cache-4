40|$|AbstractTriangular embeddings of {{complete}} graphs into surfaces are studied through {{the notion of}} tightness which is a natural combinatorial generalization of connectedness for graphs. By means of a construction which "couples" two such surfaces to produce a new one, the existence of <b>untight</b> complete triangular embeddings is proved and the known archive of tight ones is broadened. In particular, K 30 admits a tight and an <b>untight</b> triangular embedding into the same surface. Therefore, complete graphs may triangulate the same surface in nonisomorphic ways...|$|E

40|$|High {{demands are}} made on the hygiene of foods and their packages. The {{protection}} of food in every respect is the main task of a package. The legal bases for hygienic packages are laid down both in the individual provisions of the national food legislation and in EEC directives. Hygiene risks in food packaging arise both through the raw material and through the package. Hygienic methods of food packaging are pointed out. Reference is made to the risk to hygienically packaged food through <b>untight</b> or subsequently damaged packages. A scientific investigation of the cause is deemed {{necessary in order to}} avoid unhygienic packages...|$|E
40|$|Even in {{moderate}} climate zones insects cause {{losses of}} food. All types of packages made of cardboard, paper, plastics and aluminium are involved. In a large measure insects like beatles, moths and mites invade without restraint through <b>untight</b> spots on packages. The aspect of economic, non-pollutting and insect-proof food packages was not {{taken into account}} so far {{by the food and}} packaging industry. Testing of food packages which are applied in masses revealed that at present machine-made and machine closed bags are generally more insect-proof than folding cartons. But there are clear differences in package tightness subject to the applied package material...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{consists}} of three basic parts. The opening part is {{a brief description of}} problems associated with the secondary untightness of UGS wells (Underground Gas Storages) and gas wells generally. The main part of the paper is composed of some cases that we have met in our company. Solution proposals of various cases are also supplied in this part. Separate problem situations are described in terms of finding out an <b>untight</b> point and also a testing result and consequential removing of untightness. The conclusion includes knowledge summary that were taken by solution of complicatedsituations connected with well non-hermeticity...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} frames {{corresponding}} to oversampled filter banks (FBs). For {{this class of}} FB frames, we present a state-space parameterization of perfect reconstruction FB frames and explicit and numerically efficient formulas to compute the tightest frame bounds, to obtain the dual FB frame, and to construct a tight (paraunitary) FB frame from a given <b>untight</b> (nonparaunitary) FB frame. The derivation uses well-developed techniques from modern control theory, which results in the unified formulas for generic infinite-impulse-response (IIR) and finite-impulse-response (FIR) FBs. These formulas involve only algebraic manipulations of real matrices and can be computed efficiently, reliably, and exactly without the approximation required in the existing methods for generic FBs. The results provide a unified framework for frame-theory-based analysis and systematic design of oversampled filter banks...|$|E
40|$|The Generalized Second Price auction (GSP) {{has been}} widely used by search engines to sell ad slots. Previous {{studies have shown that}} the pure Price Of Anarchy (POA) of GSP is 1. 25 when there are two ad slots and 1. 259 when three ad slots. For the cases with more than three ad slots, however, only some <b>untight</b> upper bounds of the pure POA were obtained. In this work, we improve {{previous}} results in two aspects: (1) We prove that the pure POA for GSP is 1. 259 when there are four ad slots, and (2) We show that the pure POA for GSP with more than four ad slots is also 1. 259 given the bidders are ranked according to a particular permutation...|$|E
40|$|Smoky flavour {{of cocoa}} {{is a serious}} defect and is caused by unappropriate drying of the wet beans after the fermentation. Drying in <b>untight</b> plant or using an open f ire {{volatile}} phenolic components may carry over smoke onto the beans giving them this characteristic unwanted flavour, {{which may not be}} removed by any technological step. To assure or to approve sensorial evaluation a very sensitive method has been developed. Separation of smoke-phenols from the naturally occurring higher phenols in cocoa is made by steam distillation. This distillate may be directly injected into an UPLC-Apparatus connected with an electrotechnical detector. Samples with a smoky of f - f lavour show characteristic finger prints and the intensity of the flavour defect is closely related to the height of these peaks...|$|E
40|$|A lot of {{packages}} for food or pet food was tested for insect-resistant quality. After locating most of shortcomings {{at the bottom}} of bags, it could be removed by stepwise optimizing, especially by a better bonding. Leakiness with flat bags (tabular film bags) was caused by defective cross- and side seams. Developing insect-proof folding-cartons {{turned out to be more}} complicated, especially the standard-folding-carton. When tested at the start of project totally all samples were <b>untight</b> at 100 %. Exceptionally, folding-cartons bounded with cold adhesive respectively closed on the top and bottom sides with a cap-seal of "Expresso"-type were insect-resistant at more than 50 %. The participants of this project were confronted with problems about leaky packages and they became aware of the importance of insect-pro{{of packages}} for the exporting food industry.

40|$|Because of long {{distribution}} {{lines from}} the manufacturer to the consumer, commodities like sweets, baker's ware, cereal products and dried fruit will already be attacked by stored product insects in packages. The economical loss caused by food pests must be ranked as important. First of all food packages applied in masses by manufacturers, primarily folding cartons but also bags are little useful for protection of stored products against pests. For that reason, insect proof packages will be asked by manufacturers and packers. Research work has revealed that infestation of packed foods will be caused exclusively by <b>untight</b> and defective package closures. Research and development in the packaging industry will lay stress upon an improved closure technique. Moreover high technical efficiency will be claimed for mechanical packaging. Besides a perfect machine compatibility of the packaging material a good adhesive technique is a necessary condition which allows manufacturing of package clo sures without pores and holes. As an example for a new packaging and adhesive technique, the so-called "Sift-Proof" procedure combined with the "Foam Melt"-method is described...|$|E
40|$|Focus Research {{dealing with}} the {{manipulation}} of flexible objects has been on for a while. Most of the existing motion-planning algorithms that determine a trajectory from a start to the goal state revolve around traditional sampling-based and feedback control methods. What has not been done so far is the realisation of desired goal states from different initial states through reactive, global planning strategies. This study aspires in creating a robust and reactive planning strategy for deformable linear objects (DLOs). Since we concentrate on knot tying and untying as the basic tasks to be deployed on the DLO, our reactive strategy {{would be used to}} create a knot tying/untying planner. Results We are able to construct a reactive and global knot tying/untying planning strategy that can knot or unknot any particular knot type. Simple knot types experimented with are the overhand knot, slip knot and <b>untight</b> knot. We have also been successful with slightly more complex knots like the Hopf Link and the looped overhand knot. The planner shows resiliency to controlled perturbations applied on the system. This approach is compared with the traditional sampling-base...|$|E

But they are still lack of capital to expand their bussiness. In this research there are 6 hypotheses namely: first UMKM’s liability has tight correlations with general bank’s and BPR’s credit decision making, second UMKM’s revenue has tight correlations with general bank’s and BPR’s credit decision making. The third hypothesis explains that UMKM’s gain/ loss has tight correlations with general bank’s and BPR’s credit decision making, forth UMKM’s expenses has tight correlations with general bank’s and BPR’s credit decision making, fifth UMKM’s assets has tight correlations with general bank’s and BPR’s credit decision making. Last but not least UMKM’s owener’s equity has tight correlations with general bank’s and BPR’s credit decision making. The result of this srudy explains that UMKM’s asset, revenue and gain/ loss which is representative by collateral, payment and profitability has tight corelation with credit decision making, while liability (capacity), owner’s equity (capital), and expense (condition of economy) have <b>untight</b> correlation with credit decision making. However, liability, owner’s equity, expenses are still notice in credits analysis but they are not significantly influence credit decision making...|$|E

Keduang DAS is {{the largest}} supplier of sediment into the Wonogiri Dam compared with other sub-basins in the watershed entering the Wonogiri reservoir. Balai Besar Wilayah Sungai Bengawan Solo conducted reforestation program in Keduang watershed through Gerakan Nasional Kemitraan Penyelamatan Air (GNKPA) in 2011. The event aimed to minimize the impact of increasing sedimentation. The influence of the eforestation results is still uncertain. This research evaluates and analyzes quantity impacts resulting from reforestation in Keduang watershed. this research applied USLE method to analyze the soil erosion. Factors affecting soil erosion in USLE methods include: rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, length and slope gradient factor, the factor of land cover crops and conservation practical factors. This research analyze the soil erosion quantity on existing condition as well as predicted the quantity after 5, 10, an 15 years of reforestation. Arcview and Microsoft Excel were applied as tools for calculation using USLE method. The result of USLE method analysis shows that soil erosion on existing condition is 174. 955 ton/ha/year, where as the predicted quantity after 5, 10 and 15 years are espectively 143. 195 ton/ha/year, 127. 323 ton/ha/year, and 111. 450 ton/ha/year. The quantity of soil erosion has decreased every year. This decline {{is due to the}} value of C (factor of land cover) changes (decreases). With the reforestation and tree planting, which was originally sparse vegetation cover is <b>untight</b> or even open to betight, so that the potential of eroded soil to be small. Calculation of soil erosion prediction after 15 years with USLE method, acquired large land erosion at the study site of 111. 450 ton/ha/year. Large land erosion is still exceeded the maximum rate of erosion, where the maximum limit according to Morgan (1980) in areas with tropical erodible land is 25 ton/ha/year. This is due to the research only consider the change in factor C, and areas which carried out reforestation program was limited in few villages...|$|E
40|$|Fuer die Untersuchung des Kompaktierungsverhaltens von Salzgrus, das in den deutschen Endlagerkonzepten eine wichtige Rolle als Versatzmaterial fuer die Resthohlraeume spielt, wurde eine triaxiale Messeinrichtung entwickelt und in Betrieb genommen. Ihre Pruefkammer weist einen wuerfelfoermigen Innenraum mit einer Kantenlaenge von 250 mm auf. Sie ist fuer eine {{maximale}} Druckbelastung von 35 MPa ausgelegt. Die Druckbelastung des Pruefmaterials und die Messung der Verformung erfolgt unabhaengig in den 3 Raumrichtungen ueber 6 an den Innenwaenden der Pruefkammer angeordnete hydraulische Druckkissen aus Edelstahlblech, die fuer jede Messung erneuert werden. Der Hydraulikteil fuer die Beaufschlagung der Druckkissen ist primaer fuer druckgeregelte Versuche (Kriechversuche) ausgelegt, jedoch koennen auch wegegeregelte Versuche durchgefuehrt werden. Die Bestimmung der den Druckkissen zugefuehrten Mengen an Hydraulikfluessigkeit erfolgt mit hoher Genauigkeit, so dass damit die Messung sehr kleiner Verformungsraten, wie sie in einem Endlager in einer Steinsalzformation zu erwarten sind (ca. 10 "-" 9 /s), moeglich ist. Eine zusaetzliche Messung der Verformungsraten mit Hilfe von induktiven Wegaufnehmern, die die zentrale Auslenkung der Druckkissen erfassen, ist in Erprobung. Bei Raumtemperatur durchgefuehrte Testmessungen belegen die Funktionstuechtigkeit der Messeinrichtung. Die Ergebnisse von Messungen der zeitabhaengigen Kompaktierung bzw. Verformung von Salzgrus bei verschiedenen hydrostatischen und deviatorischen Spannungszustaenden (3 - 17 MPa) und Endlager-relevanten Kompaktierungsraten werden dargestellt. Erste Versuche bei Temperaturen bis 150 C zeigten, dass die ungeschuetzten Druckissen auf Grund des am Pruefmaterial adsorptiv gebundenen Wassers sehr schnell durch Salzlaugenkorrosion angegriffen werden und undicht werden. Mit der Entwicklung eines wirksamen Korrosionsschutzes fuer die Druckkissen wurde begonnen. (orig. /HP) A triaxial {{testing apparatus}} {{has been developed}} for {{the investigation of the}} consolidation behaviour of crushed salt which plays an important role as a backfill material in German disposal plant concepts. The apparatus has a cubic testing volume of 250 mm side length and is designed for a maximum pressure loading of 35 MPa. The stress loading of the test material and the measurement of the strains are performed independently in the 3 spatial directions witth the aid of 6 hydraulic pressure pads mounted at the walls of the testing volume. The pressure pads are made of stainless steel sheets. They are replaced for each new experiment. The hydraulic device for the supply of the pressure pads is primarily designed for pressure controlled experiments (creep tests), but displacement controlled tests can be performed too. The amounts of hydraulic liquid supplied to the pressure pads are registrated with high accuracy, such that very low consolidation rates can be measured as they are expected to occur in nuclear waste repositories in salt formations (about 10 "-" 9 /s). An additional technique for the measurement of the stain rates is installed and is being tested. Here the central deformation of the pressure pads is registrated with the aid of 6 inductive linear displacement gages. Several tests performed at room temperature have demonstrated the functioning of the apparatus. It is reported about the results of measurements of the time dependent consolidation and deformation at various hydrostatic and deviatoric stress states (3 - 17 MPa) and at consolidation rates comparable to repository conditions. First tests performed at elevated temperatures (150 C) have shown that due to the presence of adsorbed water in the test material the unprotected pressure pads are rapidly attacked by brine corrosion and get <b>untight.</b> Experiments with a corrosion protection for the pressure pads are under way.
