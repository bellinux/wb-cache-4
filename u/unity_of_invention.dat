50|$|Responsibility for {{establishing}} {{whether or not}} a European patent application meets the requirements of <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>invention</b> ultimately rests with the examining division.|$|E
50|$|In most patent laws, <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>invention</b> is {{a formal}} {{administrative}} requirement {{that must be}} met by a patent application to become a granted patent. Basically, a patent application can relate only to one invention {{or a group of}} closely related inventions. The purpose of this requirement is administrative, as well as financial. That is, the requirement serves to preclude the option of filing one patent application for several inventions, while paying only one set of fees (filing fee, search fee, examination fee, renewal fees, and so on). <b>Unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>invention</b> also makes the classification of patent documents easier.|$|E
5000|$|If the {{applicant}} {{disagrees with the}} ISA’s finding of lack of <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>invention,</b> the additional fees may be paid under protest. In the protest procedure, {{the applicant}} files a reasoned statement explaining why it considers that the requirement of <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>invention</b> has been complied with, or {{that the number of}} additional fees required is excessive. After payment of the additional search fees and, if required, of a protest fee, the protest is examined by a review body. If the review body finds the protest justified, it orders the total or partial reimbursement of the additional search fees, and, if applicable, the protest fee, to the applicant. When, for instance, the European Patent Office acts as ISA, the review body in charge of examining the protest consists of three members: [...] "the head of a directorate, normally the head of the directorate by which the invitation to pay additional fees was issued, an examiner with special expertise in <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>invention</b> and, normally, the examiner who issued the invitation." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Unity</b> <b>of</b> Command - For every objective, seek <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> {{command and}} <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> effort. At {{all levels of}} war, {{employment}} of military forces {{in a manner that}} masses combat power toward a common objective requires <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> command and <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> effort. <b>Unity</b> <b>of</b> command means that all the forces are under one responsible commander. It requires a single commander with the requisite authority to direct all forces in pursuit of a unified purpose.|$|R

5000|$|Under , a European patent {{application}} must [...] "...relate to one invention only or {{to a group}} of inventions so linked as to form a single general inventive concept."

50|$|Divisional {{applications}} filed voluntarily may be {{susceptible to}} {{attacks on the}} grounds of double patenting. However, where a divisional is forced by the Patent Office during prosecution (i.e. to overcome a <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>invention</b> objection), the Supreme Court of Canada has indicated that such an application and its parent should not be open to double patenting challenges.|$|E
5000|$|Under European patent {{practice}} and case law, lack of <b>unity</b> (<b>of</b> <b>invention)</b> can appear either [...] "a priori", before the prior art was examined, or [...] "a posteriori", after the prior art was examined.

50|$|Divisional {{applications}} are generally used {{in cases where}} the parent application may lack unity of invention; that is, the parent application describes more than one invention and the applicant is required to split the parent into one or more divisional applications each claiming only a single invention. The ability to file divisional applications in cases of lack of <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>invention</b> is required by Article 4G of the Paris Convention.|$|E
5000|$|When {{a patent}} {{application}} is objected {{to on the}} ground {{of a lack of}} unity, it may be still considered for patent protection, unlike in the case where the invention is found to be lacking novelty. A divisional application can usually be filed for the second invention, and for the further inventions, if any. Alternatively, a patent prosecutor may make a technical argument that there is <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>invention.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A divisional {{application}} is one {{which has been}} [...] "divided" [...] from an existing application. A {{divisional application}} can only contain subject matter in the application from which it is divided (its parent), but retains the filing and priority date of that parent. A divisional application is useful if a <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>invention</b> objection is issued, {{in which case the}} second (and third, fourth, etc.) inventions can be protected in divisional applications.|$|E

5000|$|This <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> {{command is}} one of the twelve {{principles}} of joint operations, and is defined as: <b>Unity</b> <b>of</b> command means that all forces operate under a single commander with the requisite authority to direct all forces employed in pursuit of a common purpose. During multinational operations and interagency coordination, <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> command may not be possible, but the requirement for <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> effort becomes paramount. <b>Unity</b> <b>of</b> effort—the coordination and cooperation toward common objectives, even if the participants are not necessarily part of the same command or organization—is the product of successful unified action.|$|R
50|$|<b>Unity</b> <b>of</b> {{effort is}} the state of harmonizing efforts among {{multiple}} organizations working towards a similar objective. This prevents organizations from working at cross purposes and it reduces duplication of effort. Multiple organizations can achieve <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> effort through shared common objectives. In military operations, <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> effort is similar to <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> command except it usually relates to coordinating organizations not in the same command, such as in interagency operations. In this case, <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> effort is often achieved through campaign plans or coordinating committees instead of through a unified commander. In emergency management, <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> effort describes the integrated approach by different levels of government and multiple civilian organizations in response to the event.|$|R
50|$|Under {{the former}} version of Rule 36 EPC, an {{objection}} {{of lack of}} <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>invention</b> raised in a communication of the Examining Division could trigger a 24-month period for filing a divisional application, if the particular objection was raised for the first time. However, under the amended version of Rule 36 EPC which came into effect in April 2014, divisional applications can be filed at any time providing the parent European application remains pending.|$|E

5000|$|A divisional {{application}} also claims priority {{based on the}} filing date of the parent application, but differs from a continuation application in that a {{divisional application}} claims a distinct or independent invention [...] "carved out" [...] of the parent application. A divisional application must share {{at least one of}} the inventors named in the parent application. A divisional application is often filed after the examiner issued a [...] "restriction requirement", because a patent can only claim a single invention (cf. <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>invention).</b>|$|E
