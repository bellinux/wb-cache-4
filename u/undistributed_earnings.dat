40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} Japan’s 2009 adoption of a territorial tax regime using event study methods which leverage individual firm characteristics to identify underlying drivers of market reactions. Differences in Japanese firms’ foreign and domestic effective tax rates yield an aggregate capitalization effect of ¥ 4. 3 trillion, while firms with less foreign exposure and fewer opportunities for tax avoidance experienced relatively larger abnormal returns. We attribute these results to direct tax savings on existing <b>undistributed</b> foreign <b>earnings,</b> enhanced opportunities for international expansion, and cultural biases against tax planning...|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{estimated}} the untaxed overseas profits to be from US$1.6 to $2.1 trillion. A 2011 study by JPMorgan Chase & Co. identified $1.375 trillion in <b>undistributed</b> foreign <b>earnings.</b> [...] A Wall Street Journal analysis in 2012 found that the amounts for 60 large firms grew by $166 billion in the preceding year, shielding 40% of their earnings. In 2012, a Bloomberg study found $1 trillion held overseas for 70 U.S.-based multi-national companies, using public annual reports for years ending in 2010 and 2011, and it estimated an overall total of $1.6 trillion. In 2013, a private research firm study asserted there were more than $2.1 trillion of U.S. corporate profits untaxed in 2013.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of the {{enactment}} of the anti-thin capitalization rules on capital structure after the enactment of the anti-thin capitalization rules in Taiwan. According to the theoretical derivation, companies with lower shareholder imputed tax credits ratio tend to have greater debt-to-equity ratio, while companies with higher surtax on <b>undistributed</b> <b>earnings</b> ratio tend to have higher debt-to-equity ratio. This finding is consistent with the hypotheses of this study. However, the relationships between interest-bearing liability rate, marginal income tax rate and debt-to-equity ratios are uncertain. Using 2006 – 2012 sample data for the empirical study, this paper finds that enterprise’s total debt-to-equity ratios significantly decreases after the enactment of the anti-thin capitalization rules, and provisions preventing capital weakening have policy effectiveness. The shareholder imputed tax credits ratio and total debt-to-equity ratio are negatively correlated, while interest-bearing liability rate, marginal income tax rate, and surtax on <b>undistributed</b> <b>earnings</b> ratio, are positively correlated with total debt-to-equity ratio. This finding supports the hypotheses of this study. However, marginal income tax rate is lack of significance. Regardless of the enactment of the anti-thin capitalization rules, pledge ratios, investment growth opportunities, firm size and ownership of director and supervisor ratios are positively correlated with total debt-to-equity ratio; non-debt tax shields, R&D ratio an...|$|E
40|$|Retained {{earnings}} {{of mutual funds}} and other collective investment schemes This paper was considered by BOPTEG at its June 2004 meeting. At that time, {{it was suggested that}} further work be done to help to try to resolve the issues. To that end, and to assist BOPTEG members, an annex has been added, outlining various options. A recommendation is presented. Otherwise, the paper {{is the same as the}} earlier version except that the points for discussion have been changed to address the options raised in the annex. There are inconsistencies in the current treatment of the retained {{earnings of}} various collective investment schemes.

I. Current international standards for the statistical treatment of the issue In the 1993 SNA, BPM 5, (and ESA 95) life insurance enterprises and pension funds are deemed to have no retained earnings (other than that attributable to shareholders ’ funds in life insurance companies) : the excess of net property income receivable over costs of production is channeled to policy holders or beneficiaries (households and nonresidents) through the primary distribution of income account. These funds are deemed to be reinvested, through the financial account, by the policyholders in these institutional units through net equity on life insurance reserves and pension funds. The rationale for this treatment in the 1993 SNA (para. 7. 124) is that, as the technical reserves are assets of the beneficiaries and policyholders, the investment income receivable must be shown as being paid by these enterprises to the policyholders and beneficiaries. The 1993 SNA, BPM 5 (and ESA 95) classify investments in mutual funds in the same way, that is, as shares and other equity in the financial account and balance sheet in the national accounts ’ framework (see 1993 SNA, para. 11. 86 – 97, and ESA 95, para. 5. 96 – 97) and as equity securities in the balance of payments (BPM 5, para. 388 3), irrespective of what assets the mutual fund has acquired. 4 Therefore, even if a mutual fund invests solely in debt instruments, the shares in the fund are still regarded as equity instruments...|$|E
