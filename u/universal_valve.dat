40|$|The avant-garde appears still {{linked with}} an experimentalism that is exasperated by the past. In {{the case of}} paradoxism, the anticallophile revolt has as a target the conventionalism, the clich√©s, the limitation, the stereotypes, the redundancies. The paradoxist author does not want any longer {{to be a victim}} of indebtnesses. On the contrary, he {{practices}} a kind of bovarism of the text that entails an infinite series of hypotheses. The resulting text is illimitably liberating, like a <b>universal</b> <b>valve</b> of whatever pressure...|$|E
40|$|During {{intermittent}} positive pressure respiration, volume-controlled {{rather than}} pressure-controlled ventilation is preferred. To accomplish volume-controlled ventila-tion, a safe, efficient, <b>universal</b> <b>valve</b> has been designed. This valve has an adequately low opening pressure and an automatic exit closure when desired. Intermittent positive pressure respiration (IPPR) is best accomplished with a completely closed system during the inspiratory phase, {{so that all}} gas squeezed out of the reservoir bag {{will go to the}} patient's lungs. Under these conditions ventilation is volume-controlled. A low pressure in the system during the expiratory and resting phases will have least adverse effect on the patient; however, that pressure must be slightly higher than the collapsing pressure of the reser-voir bag in order that the latter may remai...|$|E

50|$|All Schrader valves used on tires have threads {{and bodies}} {{of a single}} {{standard}} size at the exterior end, so caps and tools generally are <b>universal</b> for the <b>valves</b> on all common applications. The core of the valve can be removed or tightened with a tool.|$|R
40|$|An {{approach}} toward low-pass, high-pass and band-pass filtering is presented. Convolution coefficients possessing the filtering speed {{associated with a}} moving smoothing average without suffering a loss of resolution are discussed. Resolution was retained because the coefficients represented the equivalance of applying high order two-dimensional regression calculations to an image without considering the time-consuming summations associated with the usual normal equations. The smoothing (low-pass) and roughing (high-pass) aspects of the filters {{are a result of}} being derived from regression theory. The coefficients are <b>universal</b> integer <b>valves</b> completely described by filter size and surface order, and possess a number of symmetry properties. Double convolution lead to a single set of coefficients with an expanded mask which can yield band-pass filtering and the surface normal. For low order surfaces (0, 1), the two-dimensional convolute integers were equivalent to a moving smoothing average...|$|R
50|$|Because {{variety of}} tone colour was {{considered}} paramount, the double horn, though easier {{to play and}} more secure, was not adopted by the Viennese orchestras. The Vienna horn is, in essence, the natural horn of the Viennese classical era with double piston valves added by the instrument maker Leopold Uhlmann (1806-1878). The trumpet, instead of having the almost <b>universal</b> Perinet piston <b>valves</b> , is the old German model with rotary valves, while the F tuba is its own instrument type. The trombone in Viennese orchestras is the usual type, although here, too, the preference is for the tonal quality of a narrower bore.|$|R
25|$|A Schrader valve {{consists}} of a hollow cylindrical metal tube, typically brass, with the exterior end threaded. The interior end takes {{a variety of forms}} depending on its application. In the center of the exterior end is a metal pin pointing along the axis of the tube; the pin's end is flush {{with the end of the}} valve body. Generally, all Schrader valves are used on tires. They have threads and bodies of a single standard size at the exterior end, so caps and tools generally are <b>universal</b> for the <b>valves</b> on all automobile and bicycle pneumatic tires. Also, pressure valves can be used on Schrader valves in place of caps in order to measure the pressure of pneumatic tires. In 1891, George Schrader, the son of German-American immigrant August Schrader, invented the Schrader valve. A patent was issued on April 11, 1893.|$|R
