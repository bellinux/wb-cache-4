25|$|General {{guidelines}} for diagnosing prolactin excess (hyperprolactinemia) define the <b>upper</b> <b>threshold</b> of normal prolactin at 25µg/L {{for women and}} 20µg/L for men. Similarly, {{guidelines for}} diagnosing prolactin deficiency (hypoprolactinemia) are defined as prolactin levels below 3µg/L in women and 5µg/L in men. However, different assays and methods for measuring prolactin are employed by different laboratories and as such the serum reference range for prolactin is often determined by the laboratory performing the measurement. Furthermore, prolactin levels also vary factors including age, sex, menstrual cycle stage and pregnancy. The circumstances surrounding a given prolactin measurement (assay, patient condition, etc.) must therefore be considered before the measurement can be accurately interpreted.|$|E

[...] Steadily moving north of due west, the cyclone quickly became a hurricane the next day, and over the next three days, while bypassing the Greater Antilles to the north, it continued to intensify to a major hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of at least , yet few ships were near the eye with which to determine its path.

Swiftly crossing southernmost Florida, the potent hurricane weakened slightly before entering the Gulf of Mexico near Punta Rassa in the afternoon, and its path gradually curved northwest on September 19. Late on September 20, its path slowed drastically and curved west, making landfall near Perdido Beach, Alabama, with winds of [...] and a measured pressure of [...] in the calm eye.

40|$|The {{distance}} from the pheromone source at which Grapholitha molesta (Busck) males initiated walking, upwind flight, or wing fanning while walking varied directly with the pheromone emission rate. Roughly a 10 -fold increase in emission rate resulted in a ca. 2 -fold increase in mean maximum distance for initiation of these behaviors. Also, an apparent <b>upper</b> concentration <b>threshold</b> in males caused upwind flight to be terminated at increasing distances from the source with increasing emission rates. Thus, <b>upper</b> and lower <b>thresholds</b> apparently determine {{the boundaries of the}} "active distance” for upwind flight. There was much daily variation in mean maximum active distance, possibly due to temperature effects upon male threshold. The active distance estimates were used to design an optimal monitoring trap deployment strategy to minimize attraction of males from areas surrounding orchards. Using Bossert and Wilson's equation for active space, the average lower (initiation) threshold for upwind flight was 7. 2 × 10 − 17 g/cm 3 and the <b>upper</b> (termination) <b>threshold</b> was 2. 1 × 10 − 13 g/cm 3.

40|$|Countercyclical {{capital buffers}} are {{intended}} to protect the banking sector and the broader economy from episodes of excessive credit growth, which {{have been associated with}} financial sector procyclicality and the build-up of systemic risk. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has suggested in its guidance to national authorities that the credit-to-GDP gap be used as a guide to taking decisions regarding the countercyclical capital buffer. This paper provides a South African perspective on the implementation of this guidance. Credit-to-GDP gaps are estimated by applying a range of Hodrick-Prescott filters to real-time South African data, specifically constructed for this study, and these gaps are mapped to countercyclical buffers. The properties of these estimates are compared, and the calibration of the lower and <b>upper</b> <b>thresholds</b> of the buffer in the South African case is also investigated. The study confirms that the mechanical application of the credit-to-GDP guide is not advisable, and raises a number of issues that policymakers will have to consider when implementing the countercyclical buffer guidance. The analysis also suggests that the calibration of the lower and <b>upper</b> <b>thresholds</b> for the gaps may need to be adjusted in the South African case if the Basel Committee’s expectation that the buffers be employed only every 10 - 20 years is to be met. ...|$|R

40|$|Organisms {{living in}} {{habitats}} {{characterized by a}} marked seasonal temperature variation often have a greater thermal tolerance than those living in more stable habitats. To {{determine the extent to}} which this hypothesis applies to reef corals, we compared thermal tolerance of the early life stages of five scleractinian species from three locations spanning 17 ° of latitude along the east coast of Australia. Embryos were exposed to an 8 °C temperature range around the local ambient temperature at the time of spawning. <b>Upper</b> thermal <b>thresholds,</b> defined as the temperature treatment at which the proportion of abnormal embryos or median life span was significantly different to ambient controls, varied predictably among locations. At Lizard Island, the northern-most site with the least annual variation in temperature, the proportion of abnormal embryos increased and life span decreased 2 °C above ambient in the two species tested. At two southern sites, One Tree Island and Lord Howe Island, where annual temperature variation was greater, <b>upper</b> temperature <b>thresholds</b> were generally 4 °C or greater above ambient for both variables in the four species tested. The absolute <b>upper</b> thermal <b>threshold</b> temperature also varied among locations: 30 °C at Lizard Island; 28 °C at One Tree Island; 26 °C at Lord Howe Island. These results support previous work on adult corals demonstrating predictable differences in <b>upper</b> thermal <b>thresholds</b> with latitude. With projected ocean warming, these temperature thresholds will be exceeded in northern locations in the near future, adding to a growing body of evidence indicating that climate change is likely to be more detrimental to low latitude than high latitude corals...|$|R
