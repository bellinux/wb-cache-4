5|$|Riprap {{was laid}} on the <b>upstream</b> <b>face</b> of the dam {{beginning}} November 9 of that year. In 1962, a series of labor strikes impacted communities in the Central Valley, also affecting construction of the dam, which was temporarily halted on May 3 of that year. After work restarted on June 26, pervious core material for the dam was soon out of supply, so impervious material was used to complete the dam core.|$|E
5|$|At the Canning Dam {{and indeed}} all dams, care {{had to be}} taken to prevent water seepage between the {{foundation}} rock and the structure of the dam. At the Canning in addition to cutting back the foundation to solid unfractured rock, a cut-off trench was sited near the <b>upstream</b> <b>face</b> of the dam, down stream which a rock filled drain containing open jointed pipes was provided to intercept any seepage between the rock face and the concrete of the dam. The inclusion of an internal drainage system was considered innovative at the period. Near vertical tubular 8 in (200mm) cut-off drains were provided at five-foot (1.52 m) intervals along the dam to relieve internal seepage through the concrete.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that the}} shape that {{prevents}} {{tension in the}} <b>upstream</b> <b>face</b> also eliminates a balancing compression stress in the downstream face, providing additional economy.|$|E
50|$|The piers {{supporting}} the arches have become quite worn over time. They show several interesting architectural techniques. The bossage technique is {{visible on the}} downstream side of the eastern piers. The <b>upstream</b> <b>faces</b> of the piers show stepped cutwaters and footings. These stepped piers are a feature typical of Roman construction. Two of the relieving arches (the fifth and seventh arches from the western end) have their upstream side open but have been filled on the downstream side. The dimensions of the arches all differ due to the complex histpry of its construction. The <b>upstream</b> <b>faces</b> of the piers now have triangular cutwaters. These were all rebuilt {{during one of the}} Ottoman restorations, which accounts for their uniform appearance today.|$|R

50|$|Vilar Dam is a 58 m tall (height above foundation) and 240 m long {{rockfill}} {{embankment dam}} with a crest altitude of 555 m. The <b>upstream</b> <b>facing</b> {{of the dam}} is made of concrete. The volume of the dam is 300,000 m³. The chute spillway with 2 radial gates {{is located at the}} right side of the dam. The maximum discharge is 500 m³/s. There is also a bottom outlet.|$|R
25|$|In a {{somewhat}} similar phenomenon, the dam portion {{east of the}} center section had also broken into several larger and smaller pieces. Unlike the western side, most of these ended lying near {{the base of the}} standing section. The largest fragments fell across the lower portion of the standing section, coming to rest partially on its <b>upstream</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the arch}} dam, {{stability}} is obtained {{by a combination}} of arch and gravity action. If the <b>upstream</b> <b>face</b> is vertical the entire weight of the dam must be carried to the foundation by gravity, while the distribution of the normal hydrostatic pressure between vertical cantilever and arch action will depend upon the stiffness of the dam in a vertical and horizontal direction. When the <b>upstream</b> <b>face</b> is sloped the distribution is more complicated. The normal component of the weight of the arch ring may be taken by the arch action, while the normal hydrostatic pressure will be distributed as described above. For this type of dam, firm reliable supports at the abutments (either buttress or canyon side wall) are more important. The most desirable place for an arch dam is a narrow canyon with steep side walls composed of sound rock. The safety of an arch dam is dependent on the strength of the side wall abutments, hence not only should the arch be well seated on the side walls but also the character of the rock should be carefully inspected.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, the {{designer}} tries {{to shape the}} dam so {{if one were to}} consider the part of dam above any particular height to be a whole dam itself, that dam also would be held in place by gravity. i.e. there is no tension in the <b>upstream</b> <b>face</b> of the dam holding the top of the dam down. The designer does this because it is usually more practical to make a dam of material essentially just piled up than to make the material stick together against vertical tension.|$|E
25|$|The unusual <b>upstream</b> <b>facing</b> outfall of the Derwent is man made. It is {{believed}} to have been cut during the Roman occupation of Britain to reduce the distance between the Derwent mouth and the Roman legionary headquarters at York by 9 miles. The first navigation weir, also believed to be of Roman origin, was a flash weir built near Wheldrake to raise the level of the river upstream and regulate its flow downstream.|$|R

The reservoir is modelled with 8 -noded isoparametric displacement based solid finite elements. The study includes both stiff and flexible dams with vertical and sloped <b>upstream</b> <b>faces</b> under ramp, harmonic and random acceleration loads. The numerical results were compared {{and found to}} be in good agreement with available closed-form solutions. The same approach may be used in analyses of other waterfront structures such as quay walls...|$|R
50|$|The bridge has 15 wooden spans {{supported}} by trestle piers, {{and the five}} spans in the main river channel have triangular reinforcing trusses. Each trestle consists of five posts, one vertical and two to each side of it at an angle. Up to half-way up the pier it is reinforced by solid horizontal planking, and above that by diagonal beams {{on each side of}} the pier. The five beams which support the roadway sit on a round-ended beam on top of each pier. The abutments are granite, and the piers have metal plates on their <b>upstream</b> <b>faces</b> to protect against debris.|$|R
25|$|A {{concrete}}-face rock-fill dam (CFRD) is a rock-fill dam {{with concrete}} slabs on its <b>upstream</b> <b>face.</b> This design provides the concrete slab as an impervious wall to prevent leakage {{and also a}} structure without concern for uplift pressure. In addition, the CFRD design is flexible for topography, faster to construct and less costly than earth-fill dams. The CFRD concept originated during the California Gold Rush in the 1860s when miners constructed rock-fill timber-face dams for sluice operations. The timber was later replaced by concrete as the design was applied to irrigation and power schemes. As CFRD designs grew in height during the 1960s, the fill was compacted and the slab's horizontal and vertical joints were replaced with improved vertical joints. In the last few decades, the design has become popular.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} has eight overflow gates which channel water into four spillways. The spillways incorporate side piers on the <b>upstream</b> <b>face</b> to more correctly channel {{water over the}} dam so that each spillway discharges {{the same amount of}} water. The spillways release their water slightly above the actual bed of the river, creating a waterfall effect when they are fully open. A spillway tunnel carved from granite in the right bank of the river augments the spillways and provides for additional overflow. The total spillway capacity is half that of Grand Coulee Dam in the United States. The Export-Import Bank of the United States provided $8.9 million (about $67.2 million in 2010 inflation-adjusted dollars) in credits in 1958 to Iberduero to enable it to purchase six 120 Megawatt (MW) turbines and other electrical equipment for the power generating station, all of which were supplied by American firms.|$|E
25|$|As {{soon as the}} dam was {{loosened}} on {{its base}} the toe of the structure spalled off. This was probably the beginning of its breaking up, and probably occurred sometime after 11:30 PM during the 23 minutes in which {{the water in the}} reservoir apparently fell 3/10 of a foot. Thereupon, quite likely, a part of the east end of the dam, meanwhile undermined, went out and the dam at this end lost its hillside support. Hydrostatic uplift at the already loose west and the weight of the remaining portion of the undermined east end caused a temporary tilting of the dam towards the east, accompanied by a rapid washing away of the hillside under the dam at its west end which then also began to break up. The reservoir water was now rushing with tremendous force against both ends and against the <b>upstream</b> <b>face</b> of all that was standing of the dam. This rush of water carried away huge blocks of concrete from both ends of the dam...|$|E

40|$|The {{flow field}} {{resulting}} from the interaction of an <b>upstream</b> <b>facing</b> wall jet with a supersonic counterflowing stream has been investigated. A flow field model and the main parameters governing the phenomena were determined from quantitative and qualitative experimental observations. Experimental results for different ranges of the main parameters are presented. A theoretical analysis was performed to describe the flow field in the mixing region between the two counterflowing streams. The results obtained by applying a locally similar solution compare favorably with the experimentally measured values. Large values of jet penetration were obtained with a high subsonic or low supersonic jet; large interaction forces are characteristics of higher supersonic injections. For the case of large penetration the cooling effectiveness presented {{as a function of}} the main parameters indicates the possibility of interacting cooling applications...|$|R

About 200,000 people in northeastern Mexico lost power, and 100,000 people were left without water. About 400 houses were damaged in Veracruz, and many roads and bridges were destroyed. Heavy rainfall occurred {{in the interior of}} northeastern Mexico, peaking at [...] in González, Tamaulipas. In a reporting station in the municipality of Gómez Farías, the pluviometer reported a 24-hour rain total of , and a storm total of , which broke the precipitation record for that location, which counted with 35 years of data. This rain also caused rivers to reach record levels, as the Sabinas River rose [...] on October 6, to a new historical peak, and the Guayalejo River rose , slightly under the 1976 record. This rainfall caused the Las Ánimas dam to catch [...] of water between October 5 and October 17; however, some of this water had to be released, as the <b>upstream</b> <b>face</b> of the dam was damaged by debris, and had to be repaired. Overall, the storm produced $117.8 million in damage (2000 MXN, $12.4 million 2000 USD) in the state.|$|E
500|$|In {{arch dam}} design, two basic shapes are adopted. These are the constant–radius arch and the constant-angle arch, the latter design is more complex. In the constant-radius arch design, {{which is also}} known as the single-radius arch, the shape of the dam is {{cylindrical}} with vertical <b>upstream</b> <b>face</b> while the downstream face is battered. The constant-angle arch design has also a variable–radius arch. In this design, the central opening angle is constant whereas the arch radius increases from the base to the crest; this increase towards the crest is proportional to the increase of the canyon width of the gorge. Further, according to the theory of constant-arch design, the arch action {{at the base of the}} dam exerts the maximum pressure on the base. A [...] "V" [...] shaped gorge in particular is considered an ideal feature for building this type of dam. This design ensures substantial savings in use of construction material as opposed to the constant–radius arch design. Lars R. Jorgenson who had conceived this concept had proved that the most economic design of the dam was obtained with an optimum opening angle of 133.6°, with the least quantity of concrete. This design was applied with some modifications for the Salmon Creek Dam, which was designed with constant opening angle of 113° with radius varying from [...] at the base to [...] at the crest.|$|E

The western pier shows a standing human figure wearing a kaftan, boots and hat known as a sharbush. His bent arms rest on a straight object that may be an arrow or a mace. A figure on the inner wall of the same pier rests on a bow and the other figure on this wall holds a bird.|$|R

40|$|Miter gates have been, {{and still}} are, {{widely used in}} {{hydraulic}} engineering as control devices for several types of locks (e. g., navigation, flood, tidal, etc). Since centuries, engineering practice suggests a range of optimal values for the angle that the gate leaves must form pointing <b>upstream,</b> <b>facing</b> the current. According to experience and literature, this optimal range corresponds to an angle between the leaf and the normal to the lock wall that varies between 9. 5 ° and 33. 7 °. It is confirmed here that in horizontally framed miter gates, {{which is the most}} usual arrangement, these optimal values depend only on the lock dimensions (span and height) and the geometric characteristics of the girder cross-section. Using a simple dimensionless geometrical parameterization and static equilibrium considerations, a general approach for the preliminary dimensioning of miter gate leaves is developed, based on the optimization of the angle between the leaves for the three most commonly used types of girder cross-section: square, rectangular, and “I-beam” (IPE series) ...|$|R

2500|$|Rock-fill dams are {{embankments}} of compacted free-draining granular {{earth with}} an impervious zone. The earth utilized often contains {{a high percentage}} of large particles, hence the term [...] "rock-fill". The impervious zone may be on the <b>upstream</b> <b>face</b> and made of masonry, concrete, plastic membrane, steel sheet piles, timber or other material. The impervious zone may also be within the embankment in which case it is referred to as a core. In the instances where clay is utilized as the impervious material the dam is referred to as a composite dam. To prevent internal erosion of clay into the rock fill due to seepage forces, the core is separated using a filter. Filters are specifically graded soil designed to prevent the migration of fine grain soil particles. When suitable material is at hand, transportation is minimized leading to cost savings during construction. Rock-fill dams are resistant to damage from earthquakes. However, inadequate quality control during construction can lead to poor compaction and sand in the embankment which can lead to liquefaction of the rock-fill during an earthquake. Liquefaction potential can be reduced by keeping susceptible material from being saturated, and by providing adequate compaction during construction. An example of a rock-fill dam is New Melones Dam in California or the Fierza Dam in Albania.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{describes}} and interprets watertightness {{problems that}} occurred in two Italian earth dams: the Polverina Dam, a zoned earth dam with vertical clay core, and the Zoccolo Dam, a homogeneous embankment with <b>upstream</b> <b>facing</b> of bituminous conglomerate. Measurements of seepage flows, pore water pressures and displacements in different stages of the dams' lifetime were collected and suitably interpreted to detect the effectiveness of measured physical quantities in revealing watertightness problems. The paper focuses {{on the role of}} pore water pressure measurements to such a scope and enhances how the effectiveness of such measurements may be strongly affected by the particular stage reached by the consolidation process within the dam. The analysis of the two case-studies proved that pore water pressure measurements may result effective in revealing hydraulic problems only when significant re-equilibrium processes have taken place in the dam zones where the measurement points are located. Measurements result, instead, ineffective during a nearly undrained stage. The paper also discusses the effectiveness of seepage flow measurements to detect possible hydraulic problems...|$|R
