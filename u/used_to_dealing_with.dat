500|$|Like {{many animals}} that evolved in {{isolation}} from significant predators, the dodo was entirely fearless of humans. This fearlessness and its inability to fly made the dodo easy prey for sailors. The human population on Mauritius (an area of [...] ) never exceeded 50 people in the 17th century, but they introduced other animals, including dogs, pigs, cats, rats, and crab-eating macaques, which plundered dodo nests and competed for the limited food resources. At the same time, humans destroyed the dodo's forest habitat. The impact of these introduced animals, especially the pigs and macaques, on the dodo population is currently considered more severe than that of hunting. Rats would not have caused such {{a problem for the}} dodo, as they would have been <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> local land crabs.|$|E
500|$|Attorneys {{with the}} office of the Texas Attorney General took on Mitchell's case after being {{contacted}} by the TMB. Assistant Attorney General David Glickler later said that the case was the most bizarre he had seen in an 11-year stint {{with the office}}. [...] "We're <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> cases where public officials have enriched themselves {{at the expense of the}} office and the public trust, like bribery and theft. But there was no financial benefit to the bad actors in this case." [...] The jury returned with a not guilty verdict after an hour of deliberation. Those present in the courtroom said that each juror approached Mitchell after the verdict and hugged her. In comments he made after the trial, jury foreman Harley Tyler said he wondered why the nurses were arrested. ANA president Rebecca Patton said that the verdict was [...] "a resounding win on behalf of patient safety." ...|$|E
500|$|Like {{many animals}} that evolved in {{isolation}} from significant predators, the dodo was entirely fearless of humans. This fearlessness and its inability to fly made the dodo easy prey for sailors. Although some scattered reports describe mass killings of dodos for ships' provisions, archaeological investigations have found scant evidence of human predation. Bones {{of at least two}} dodos were found in caves at Baie du Cap that sheltered fugitive slaves and convicts in the 17th century, which would not have been easily accessible to dodos because of the high, broken terrain. The human population on Mauritius (an area of [...] ) never exceeded 50 people in the 17th century, but they introduced other animals, including dogs, pigs, cats, rats, and crab-eating macaques, which plundered dodo nests and competed for the limited food resources. At the same time, humans destroyed the forest habitat of the dodos. The impact of the introduced animals on the dodo population, especially the pigs and macaques, is today considered more severe than that of hunting. Rats were perhaps not much of a threat to the nests, since dodos would have been <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> local land crabs.|$|E

2500|$|Paisley {{opposed the}} European Economic Community (EEC), but stood for {{election}} to the European Parliament to give a platform to his views and those of his supporters. In June 1979, in the first {{election to the}} European Parliament, Paisley won {{one of the three}} Northern Ireland seats. He topped the poll, with 29.8% of the first preference votes. [...] On 17 July, Paisley interrupted the opening proceedings of the European Parliament to protest that the Union Jack outside the building was flying upside down. Louise Weiss, who presided over the Parliament, dealt with the interruption swiftly and later said of it that she was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> [...] "recalcitrant youngsters". On 18 July, Paisley tried to interrupt Jack Lynch—then Irish Prime Minister and President of the European Council—as he was making a speech in the Parliament. Paisley was shouted down by other MEPs.|$|E
2500|$|Chris Mullin succeeded St. Jean {{with the}} title of Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations in 2004. He hoped to build a winning team around Jason Richardson, Mike Dunleavy Jr and Troy Murphy, and drafted 7-foot center Andris Biedriņš from Latvia (11th overall). At the 2005 trading deadline, he bolstered to {{the team with the}} {{acquisition}} of [...] point guard Baron Davis, bringing to the team its first superstar since Mullin himself. The Warriors enjoyed a great start to the 2005–06 season, entering the new year with a plus [...]500 winning percentage {{for the first time since}} 1994, but managed to win only 13 more games through the end of March due to injuries. Davis often found himself at odds with new head coach Mike Montgomery (<b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> college players in his long tenure at Stanford) and failed to remain healthy, playing in just 54 games. On April 5, 2006, the Warriors were officially eliminated from playoff contention in a 114–109 overtime loss to the Hornets, extending their playoff drought to 12 seasons.|$|E
2500|$|Idle {{was born}} in Harton Hospital, in South Shields in County Durham, to which {{his mother had been}} {{evacuated}} from the north west of England. His mother, Norah Barron (Sanderson), was a health visitor and his father, Ernest Idle, served in the Royal Air Force during World War II, only to be killed in a hitch-hiking accident shortly after the war. His mother had difficulty coping with a full-time job and bringing up a child, so when Idle was seven, she enrolled him in the Royal Wolverhampton School as a boarder. At this time, the school was a charitable foundation dedicated to the education and maintenance of children who had lost one or both parents. Idle is quoted as saying: [...] "It was a physically abusive, bullying, harsh environment for a kid to grow up in. I got <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> groups of boys and getting on with life in unpleasant circumstances and being smart and funny and subversive at the expense of authority.
