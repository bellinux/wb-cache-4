The two halves of the crest are separated by a median suture. In front of the orbit, the crest is made of thick bone.|$|E

The Norman Chapel dates from the 11th century and is the oldest accessible part of the castle, and retains its original Saxon architectural style. The Tunstal Chapel is the larger of the two; it dates from the 15th century and is named after Cuthbert Tunstal. Both chapels are used for worship within the college.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} last interment, the local rulers {{abandoned}} the shaft graves in favour {{of a new and}} more imposing form of tomb already developing in Messenia, south Peloponessus, the tholos. Around 1250 BC, when the fortifications of Mycenae were extended, the Grave Circle was included inside the new wall. A double ring peribolos wall was also built around the area. It appears that the site became a temenos (sacred precinct), while a circular construction, possibly an altar was found above one grave. The burial site had been replanned as a monument, an attempt by the 13th century BC Mycenean rulers to appropriate the possible heroic past of the older ruling dynasty. Under this context, the land surface was built <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a level precinct for ceremonies, with the stelae over the graves being re-erected. A new entrance, the Lion Gate, was constructed near the site.|$|E
5|$|The First World War and the {{creation}} of the First Australian Imperial Force led to a significant shortage of players available for cricket. As a result, Ponsford was called <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his first-grade debut for St Kilda during the 1916–17 season, just one week before his sixteenth birthday. This match was against his old club Fitzroy, and was played at the familiar Brunswick Street Oval. The young Ponsford's shot-making lacked power, and after making twelve singles, he was bowled. He played ten matches in his first season with the St Kilda First XI and averaged 9.30 runs per innings. By the 1918–19 season, Ponsford topped the club batting averages with an average of 33. He also topped the bowling averages, taking 10 wickets at an average of 16.50 runs per wicket with his leg spin.|$|E

DeVille's considerable reputation in Paris buoyed him <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> this disc... With guest spots by Dr. John, Zachary Richard, and David Hidalgo, DeVille creates a tapestry of roots rock and Crescent City second line, traces of 1950s doo-wop, and elegant sweeping vistas of Spanish soul balladry, combined with lyrics full of busted-down heroes, hungry lovers, and wise men trying {{to get off the}} street. The sound of the album balances Creole soul and pure rock pyrotechnics. DeVille sounds like a man resurrected, digging as deep as the cavernous recesses of the human heart.|$|E

Carless made his Football League debut in 1932 with Cardiff City and spent several years there without establishing himself in the first team. He went on to play for Altrincham and return to Barry Town before the Second World War. Carless joined Plymouth Argyle in 1946, playing 11 games as a guest in the Football League South and then signing <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> four Second Division appearances when the full league programme returned.|$|E
25|$|Z51, {{the only}} ship {{of the class}} to be laid down, was ordered from Deschimag on 25 November 1942, and {{launched}} on 2 October 1944. She was sunk during a major air raid on Bremen, on 21 March 1945. She had just been moved away from a fitting-out quay at the Deschimag yard, although heavily incomplete: she had only her forward and after shelter decks, no machinery was installed and her shaft tunnels had been welded <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> them watertight.

25|$|In 1979, Chris Fick and Betty Martin {{acquired}} the 6,000-square-foot building at 30 York Street and renovations were undertaken {{in order to}} create a more light-filled space prior to Gallery 30’s opening.

Gettysburg contractor Robert Crouthamel was hired to construct a small house inside the building to serve as Gallery 30’s children’s book department. Gallery 30’s logo and storefront sign were designed by architect Fred Harle of Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania; the logo consisted of a white numeral 30 oriented at a 30-degree angle on a green background.|$|E
25|$|Roll-up or {{scroll-up}} or paint-on or scrolling: Real-time words sent in paint-on or scrolling mode {{appear from}} left to right, up to one line at a time; when a line is filled in roll-up mode, the whole line scrolls <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> way for a new line, and the line on top is erased. The lines usually appear {{at the bottom of}} the screen, but can actually be placed on any of the 14 screen rows to avoid covering graphics or action. This method is used when captioning video in real-time such as for live events, where a sequential word-by-word captioning process is needed or a pre-made intermediary file isn't available. This method is signaled on EIA-608 by a two-byte caption command or in Teletext by replacing rows for a roll-up effect and duplicating rows for a paint-on effect. This allows for real-time caption line editing.|$|E
25|$|Di Venuto {{was called}} <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his {{first-class}} debut against Queensland {{at the age}} of 19. In a match played at the Gabba from 13–16 March 1992, Di Venuto came into the Tasmanian side for the first time. Although not performing exceptionally, his 33 not out showed he had the temperament to move onto the next level, and helped Tasmania to a total of 400/6 declared. The match ended in a draw, but Di Venuto was now {{in the minds of the}} Tasmanian selectors. The following season Di Venuto did not feature for his state at first-class level, but returned to grade cricket to refine his technique. The break worked. Di Venuto returned for the 1993/94 season, and scored 678 runs at 37.66, with a high score of 125 a highlight. Di Venuto's return also helped Tasmania qualify for the Sheffield Shield final for the first time ever. They played against the New South Wales Blues at the Sydney Cricket Ground, but the occasion of reaching the final proved too much, with New South Wales won by an innings and 61 runs.|$|E
