40|$|The {{decision}} to <b>use</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> can be complicated by many factors. The concerns of congenital malformation, {{the effects of}} drugs during labour, withdrawal effects on the newborn, and the exposure of the breast-fed newborn to drugs {{are some of the}} issues every physician is faced with when treating a pregnant woman. Drugs should be used during pregnancy only in situations where anticipated benefits far outweigh the possible risks. Approximately 20 %- 30 % of women of childbearing age reportedly use antidepressants. It is absolutely essential that physicians know the effects of psychotropics on pregnancy and lactation before they issue a prescription. In this paper I have reviewed the effects of different classes of psychotropics on women during pregnancy and lactation...|$|E

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2014. Includes bibliographical references. Both {{legal and}} illicit <b>use</b> of {{prescription}} <b>drugs</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> {{is thought to}} be increasingly common in the state of Hawaiʻi, based on trends demonstrated elsewhere in the country and throughout the world. Prescription opioids, along with antianxiety and antidepressant medications are of special concern, both for their prevalence and for the potential risks associated with <b>using</b> these <b>drugs</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> The purpose of this dissertation is to investigate prescription <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> in Hawaiʻi, with a focus on opioids and antianxiety and antidepressant medications. The first of three studies sought to determine the prevalence of prescription opioid <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> in Hawaiʻi, describe differences in prescription opioid <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> in Hawaiʻi by maternal demographic characteristics, and investigate possible predictors of prescription opioid <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> through the use of multivariable logistic regression. The second study aimed to determine whether prescription opioid use <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> was associated with poorer birth outcomes among users when compared to non-users in Hawaiʻi; specifically focusing on associations between prescription opioid use <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> and risk of small for gestational age, preterm, or low birth weight deliveries among women giving birth to live, singleton infants in Hawaiʻi. Study three attempted to describe the under-studied topics of anxiety and depression before, <b>during,</b> and after <b>pregnancy,</b> along with related help-seeking behaviors and treatment strategies, for which there is a scarcity of information in Hawaiʻi. Findings from the three studies covered in this dissertation confirm that use of prescription opioids and antianxiety and antidepressant medications is relatively common <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> in Hawaiʻi. They also provide more detailed information on usage patterns, differences by demographic characteristics, and associated risk factors and birth and maternal health outcomes. All three also provide suggestions for future research avenues in order to more fully understand the complete landscape of prescription <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> in Hawaiʻi...|$|R

40|$|It {{is unclear}} whether {{intensive}} services for women <b>using</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> can reduce child maltreatment. Within-subjects, dose-response analyses can be conducted us-ing Child Protective Services (CPS) reports. Dose of services received can indicate either engagement or higher need for ser-vices. Using data from an intensive intervention program for mothers of drug-exposed infants, the authors examined asso-ciations between CPS reports and (a) dose of services received and (b) a termination status variable combining dose of ser-vices received with duration of service involvement and prog-ress on treatment plan goals. Cox regression revealed no association between dose of services and follow-up CPS re-ports. The termination status variable was strongly related to follow-up CPS reports, such that higher ratings were associ-ated with significantly lower risk of re-report, even after con-trolling for baseline motivation.

40|$|Background and Objectives: The {{abuse and}} the drug {{addiction}} become an important public health problem, gaining even more emphasis {{when it comes to}} pregnant women, since almost all drugs cross the placenta and cause effects on the fetus, compromising their development. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of the <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> among mothers attended in a teaching hospital of the interior of the Rio Grande do Sul. Methods: It is a cross-sectional study of 314 mothers and their newborns, attended by the Unified Health System {{in the first half of}} 2014. Data collection occurred by analysis of medical records, application of semi structured questionnaires and interviews with mothers users of drugs of abuse. Results: It was noted that the most consumed substance was the alcohol, with 151 users (48. 1 %), followed by tobacco (44, 6 %). The most <b>used</b> illicit <b>drug</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> was marijuana (8. 0 %). Moreover, it was found that 53. 8 % of the sample had contact with smokers and there was a tendency for mothers to abandon illicit drugs earlier than lawful. Conclusion: Given the above, it highlights the importance of early screening for <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> and discussion on the part of health professionals with the community in order to make it more clear the harm that abuse drugs offer as well as the importance of abstinence <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy...</b>|$|R
50|$|Project Prevention {{says their}} main {{goal is to}} promote {{awareness}} {{of the dangers of}} <b>using</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> They are better known, however, for paying drug addicts cash for volunteering for long-term birth control, including sterilization. The organization offers US$300 (£200 in the UK) to each participant. The New York Times reports that the organization initially offered more money to women who chose tubal ligations and men who chose vasectomies than to those who chose long-term birth control like intrauterine devices, but criticism forced them to adopt a flat rate. To receive the money, clients have to show evidence they have been arrested on a drug-related offence, or provide a doctor's certificate saying they <b>use</b> <b>drugs,</b> and further evidence is needed confirming that the birth-control procedure has taken place.

40|$|An amicus brief {{in support}} of the {{defendant}} in the matter of State of New Mexico v. Cynthia Martinez. PB&J, Family Services, Inc., through this brief as amicus curiae, has demonstrated that the decision rendered by the Court of Appeals was correct. The New Mexico Legislature did not draft NMSA 1978, § 36 - 6 - 1 (D) (1973) to encompass the situation of a pregnant woman <b>using</b> <b>drugs</b> or alcohol <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> The Legislature’s failure to pass legislation specifically criminalizing such conduct after careful consideration indicates that the Legislature did not intend for the statute to be so broadly construed. This is particularly true when considering the fiscal impact reports accompanying the proposed legislation. This decision by the Legislature is consistent with sound socioeconomic policy that was cited in the fiscal impact reports accompanying the proposed bills. Criminalizing <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> would have a devastating effect on pregnant women and their fetuses’ health. In addition, criminalizing behavior <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> would also likely burden a pregnant woman’s decision to carry her fetus to term. Further, the children of these women would also suffer the effects of separation from their mothers at critical developmental stages. These women and children would likely have better psychological outcomes from treatment not incarceration. In addition, studies of attempts to criminalize behavior <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> nationally indicate that prosecution under the State’s proposed interpretation of NMSA 1978, § 36 - 6 - 1 (D) (1973) would in all probability have a disparate effect on low-income women, women of color, and their children. Finally, a cost-benefit analysis of the potential impact of prosecuting women for <b>using</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> reveals a negative financial impact on the foster care and juvenile justice systems of this State. New Mexico cannot afford to create an additional category of children likely to end up in the foster care system. Treatment is a more cost-effective option. PB&J Family Services, Inc...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: According to the 2004 National Survey on <b>Drug</b> <b>Use</b> and Health, 4. 6 % of American women {{reported}} {{use of an}} illicit <b>drug</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> Previous studies on illicit <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> and perinatal outcomes showed inconsistent results. METHODS: This population-based study included mothers who delivered live-born infants without birth defects between 1997 and 2004 and completed interviews for the National Birth Defects Prevention Study (response rate 69 %; n= 5871). Prevalence of self-reported illicit <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> (specifically cannabis, cocaine, and stimulants) <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> and its associations with demographic and social factors were assessed. We used multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses to study the associations of cannabis use with birth weight and gestational age. RESULTS: The prevalence of reported illicit <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> was 3. 6 % (standard error 0. 24). Pregnant users of cannabis, cocaine, and stimulants were younger, had {{a lower level of}} education and lower household income, and were less likely to have used folic acid in the periconceptional period than nonusers.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} the separate effects of maternal HIV infection and <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> on growth of uninfected {{children in their}} first 3 years. DESIGN [...] Retrospective analysis of measurements from health visitor records made during routine child health surveillance at 6 weeks, 10 months, and 3 years of age. Multilevel analysis allowed for between-infant variation in fitted growth lines, and adjustment for other factors. Growth was {{described in terms of}} an intercept (z score at term) and growth slopes (change in z score per year) up to, and from, 4 months. SUBJECTS [...] 290 case babies delivered in Edinburgh hospitals to women who reported injection <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> by either themselves or their HIV infected partner, and 186 community controls. A total of 131 (45 %) of the case babies were born to women who <b>used</b> <b>drugs,</b> predominantly opiates, <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> and 93 (32 %) to HIV infected women. The eight infected children were excluded from analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Age and sex standardised z scores for height, weight, and body mass index. RESULTS [...] 459 (96 %) of the 476 records for cases and controls were traced, yielding 1432 weight and 939 height measurements. Maternal HIV infection was not found to affect growth; at 3 years the estimated effect on weight z score was 0. 16 with 95 % confidence interval (- 0. 25 to 0. 57) and for height 0. 18 (- 0. 19 to 0. 55). <b>Drug</b> <b>use</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> was associated with lighter babies at 40 weeks followed by depressed growth in the first four months, these infants remaining just slightly smaller at 3 years with an estimated effect on z scores of - 0. 5 for weight with 95 % confidence interval (- 0. 89 to - 0. 11) and - 0. 37 (- 0. 72 to - 0. 02) for height.

40|$|Background: At {{the time}} of marketing, {{knowledge}} on {{the safety of the}} <b>use</b> of <b>drugs</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> is still limited, as pregnant women are not included in pre-marketing research. Also after marketing, collecting information on <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> can be bothersome. In 2013 the pREGnant project started in order to develop and implement a national register for medical <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> in the Netherlands. This register will be used for signal detection and conducting epidemiological studies. In February 2014, a pilot study was started to test and validate this register. Objectives: To describe the first results of the pilot phase of the pREGnant register. Methods: In pREGnant, exposure to medical drugs and other potential risk factors are monitored prospectively. Data are collected by means of web-based questionnaires and completed by pregnant women, focusing on medical <b>drug</b> <b>use,</b> the health of the pregnant woman, pregnancy complications and outcomes, and the health of the child. In the pilot phase, different schemes for data collection are introduced in order to choose the best practice for inclusion.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has provided inconclusive evidence regarding the neuropsychological difficulties of {{children born to}} mothers partaking in opioid or poly-drug use <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> Little is known about how these children fare as they get older. The present longitudinal study includes follow-up data on 45 children born to mothers who used heroin and poly-drugs {{and a group of}} 48 children without prenatal drug exposure. Most of the drug-exposed youths were placed in permanent foster or adoptive homes before one year of age. The youths (ages 17 to 21) were administered 10 neuropsychological tests. The drug-exposed youths had cognitive and fine motor functions within the normal range compared to population norms but performed significantly worse than the non-exposed group. There were indications of generally lower cognitive functions rather than specific problems with executive functioning. Lower mean birthweight in the risk group (619 grams mean difference, p <. 001) only partially mediated the group differences in cognitive functioning. There was a tendency for youths who had few and early changes in their caregivers or who were born to mothers who had used the least number of different <b>drugs</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> to have the best cognitive scores. The study indicates that youths born to mothers who <b>used</b> multiple <b>drugs</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> are vulnerable relative to their peers within a wide range of cognitive functions.

The aim {{of this study was to}} estimate the prevalence of illicit <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> among pregnant women by using maternal hair analysis. Methods A toxicological analysis of hair was used to detect chronic recreational <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> In 2007, 347 mother-infant dyads were included from the Hospital La Candelaria, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Canary Islands (Spain). Data on socioeconomic characteristics and on substance misuse <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> were collected using a structured questionnaire. Drugs of abuse: opiates, cocaine, cannabinoids and amphetamines were detected in maternal hair by immunoassay followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for confirmation and quantitation. Results Hair analysis revealed 2. 6 % positivity for cocaine and its metabolites. Use of cocaine <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> was associated with unusual behaviour with potentially harmful effects on the baby. Conclusions The results of the study demonstrate significant cocaine use by pregnant women in Canary Islands. The data should be used for the purpose of preventive health and policy strategies aimed to detect and possibly to avoid in the future prenatal exposure to drugs of abuse. </p...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{pregnant}} women and mothers who are or were <b>using</b> <b>drugs.</b> The {{first part of the}} thesis consists of a theoretical research of the significance of femininity, pregnancy, motherhood and the <b>use</b> of <b>drugs.</b> The main questions that I tried to answer are: How do the people around them percept the target group, and how the members of the target group experience these perceptions? Which support groups and approaches are available in Slovenia and abroad? The basis for the evaluation of each treatment was the opinion expressed by members of the target group {{and the extent to which}} the treatment met their specific needs and desires. Interviewees who <b>used</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> and after birth expressed feelings of fear and guilt. They feel guilty because they used drugs; they are afraid that the use might have an effect on child’s health and that the children would be taken from them. They think that people around them do not have a full understanding of their behaviour and judge them. Drug users are mostly satisfied with care they receive from various institutions. It turns out they do not think about it and do not have a shaped opinion. They usually leave decisions to professionals and do not doubt their practices. They sometimes describe bad experience with individual professionals, but this cannot be generalized. The majority of them describe their families and fathers of children as the least supportive. The study of foreign literature has shown that there are many ways of working with this target group. In Slovenia, we still lack knowledge and experience with {{pregnant women and}} mothers who are or were <b>using</b> <b>drugs,</b> which is shown as an excessive bias towards the target group and inability for multidisciplinary integration. ...|$|R

In this study, the authors report the results of systematic reviews of <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> by focusing on pregnant women with a chronic disease, specifically, epilepsy, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or schizophrenia. The authors studied the clinical impact of <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> in these chronic diseases on the mother and fetus, as well as the ethical issues and socioeconomic impact of <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> for women with these conditions. The results indicate that treatment discontinuation in epilepsy and schizophrenia can lead to serious adverse effects, whereas pregnancy can have an ameliorating effect on RA symptoms. Delivery and neonatal complications were {{associated with the use of}} older generation drugs across the 3 diseases. Newer generation drugs were deemed safer but more expensive. Ethical considerations for physicians and patients involved mainly the potential risks of <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> for the fetus. In conclusion, treatment guidelines need to be developed in the future; additionally, better insight into the economics of pregnancy for women with chronic diseases will improve value for money in obstetric care...|$|R
40|$|Human {{development}} is a remarkably complex process whereby the union of two small cells can {{after a period of}} time give rise to a new human being, complete with vital organs, bones, muscles, nerves, blood vessels, and much more. Considering the intricacy of the developmental process, it is indeed miraculous that most babies are born healthy. Some children, however, are born with abnormalities. Environmental agents, such as drugs, are responsible for some of these abnormalities. Unfortunately, social and therapeutic <b>drugs</b> are widely <b>used</b> among pregnant women. Many commonly <b>used</b> <b>drugs</b> are known to disrupt the normal developmental process and cause a wide range of birth defects, learning disabilities, and behavioral problems. This paper will briefly summarize the normal process of human development and the roles of the fetal membranes and the placenta. It will also explain how teratogens can interfere with normal development and cause a variety of congenital abnormalities. In addition, this paper will describe some of the known and suspected teratogenic drugs and their harmful effects on a developing embryo/fetus. Finally, the last portion of the paper will describe the making of the accompanying pamphlet: the conceptual, research, and technical processes behind the final product. The pamphlet was made with the intention of educating expectant mothers about the harmful effects of <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> and lactation. The pamphlet focuses on risks associated with drugs such as alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana, heroin, and cocaine, as well as prescription and over-the-counter medications. Many women are not aware of the potential dangers associated with prenatal drug exposure, and some women, although aware of the potential adverse effects of <b>using</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> have conditions which require medication. Women receiving treatment need to understand the importance of consulting their doctors upon becoming pregnant, or planning to become pregnant, to determine the safest course of action for both themselves and their babies. Also, it is important for women {{to be aware of the}} possible risks associated with breastfeeding while taking drugs. Many <b>drugs</b> a mother <b>uses</b> can be transmitted to her breastfed child. Breastfeeding is generally recommended because breastmilk contains numerous substances which defend a newborn against infections, and the act of breastfeeding helps create a bond between mother and child. However, maternal <b>use</b> of certain <b>drugs</b> may require the mother to stop nursing in order to minimize risk to the baby. Further research in the field of teratology and increased public awareness regarding the harmful effects of drugs on a developing fetus promise to significantly reduce the rate of preventable birth defects...|$|R
40|$|The <b>use</b> of <b>drugs</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> still {{represents}} {{a challenge for}} medicine, since the majority of drugs cross the placental barrier with a potential to cause several congenital problems to the fetus, {{and most of them}} have not been clinically tested in pregnant patients. At the same time, the medicalization phenomenon, self-medication, and lack of patient information about the misuse of medicines are additional problems. Thus, the aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the pattern of medicine consumption in high-risk pregnancies and the determinants related to this consumption pattern. In order to do so, a cross-sectional descriptive study was performed with puerperal women who had a history of high-risk pregnancy. Statistically significant associations were found between self-medication and fewer prenatal visits, and cigarette use <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> and a higher number of children. According to these data, the vulnerability of this population to the risks of <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> is evident, demonstrating a gap that requires urgent interventions in health-care education...|$|R
40|$|CASE REPORT: A 47 {{year old}} female with severe {{deficiency}} of three limbs visited our Genetic Counselling Clinic and {{asked us to}} give her a certificate that her complex limb deficiency was caused by thalidomide (Contergan). According to her explanation, her mother <b>used</b> this <b>drug</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> which was given to her by her sister, who lived in West Germany. The characteristic signs of thalidomide embryopathy are: radial type limb deficiency including most severe forms of phocomelia and amelia, ear abnormalities. In the case of this woman, however, FFU (femoral-fibula-ulna) complex was found: bilateral femur hypoplasia (F), and fibular hypoplasia (F) with the lack of Vth and IVth toes, in addition with ulnar hypoplasia (U) with the deficiency of Vth and IVth fingers in her right upper limb. The left upper limb was not affected. Besides that, she was treated with schizophrenia. In conclusion, there is no association between the supposed thalidomide use <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> and FFU complex...|$|R
40|$|The {{risks of}} {{teratogenesis}} and {{other adverse effects}} on the neonate have created a cautious attitude towards the <b>use</b> of <b>drugs</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> It is generally believed that drug intake in pregnancy is high and variable in different countries, but the quality of prescriptions and <b>use</b> of <b>drugs</b> {{by the majority of}} physicians and women has by no means been adequately clarified. To identify the pattern of <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> in pregnancy a collaborative network was set up by WHO - IRO to collect comparable data on a population large enough to represent the current situation across various ’cultural’ and health care settings. This study has shown that, except {{in the case of the}} prophylactic administration of haematologicals during the antenatal period and the intrapartum prescriptions to manage labour actively, the majority of pregnant women and health care professionals in Malta have a conservative attitude towards drug prescription in pregnancy and lactation using medications only when they are considered essential...|$|R
