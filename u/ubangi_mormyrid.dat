5000|$|Peters' elephant-nose fish (Gnathonemus petersii; syn. Gnathonemus brevicaudatus Pellegrin, 1919, Mormyrus petersii GÃ¼nther, 1862) is an African {{freshwater}} elephantfish in {{the genus}} Gnathonemus. Other names in English include elephantnose fish, long-nosed elephant fish, and <b>Ubangi</b> <b>mormyrid,</b> after the Ubangi River. As the Latin name petersii confirms it {{is named after}} someone called [...] "Peters" [...] (probably Wilhelm Peters), although the apostrophe is often misplaced and the common name given as [...] "Peter's elephantnose fish". It uses electrolocation to find prey, and has the largest brain-to-body oxygen use ratio of all known vertebrates (around 0.6).|$|E
