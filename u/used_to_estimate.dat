5|$|To {{determine}} winds aloft, rawinsondes determine {{wind speed}} by GPS, radio navigation, or radar tracking of the probe. Alternatively, {{movement of the}} parent weather balloon position can be tracked from the ground visually using theodolites. Remote sensing techniques for wind include SODAR, Doppler lidars and radars, which can measure the Doppler shift of electromagnetic radiation scattered or reflected off suspended aerosols or molecules, and radiometers and radars {{can be used to}} measure the surface roughness of the ocean from space or airplanes. Ocean roughness can be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>estimate</b> wind velocity close to the sea surface over oceans. Geostationary satellite imagery can be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>estimate</b> the winds throughout the atmosphere based upon how far clouds move from one image to the next.

5|$|Both Giovanni Borelli and Cassini made careful {{tables of}} {{the motions of}} Jupiter's moons, {{allowing}} predictions of the times when the moons would pass before or behind the planet. By the 1670s, {{it was observed that}} when Jupiter was {{on the opposite side of}} the Sun from Earth, these events would occur about 17minutes later than expected. Ole Rømer deduced that light does not travel instantaneously (a conclusion that Cassini had earlier rejected), and this timing discrepancy was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>estimate</b> the speed of light.|$|E
5|$|In 1959, {{observations}} {{in the microwave}} part of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum (0.1–10GHz) led {{to the discovery of}} the Jovian decimetric radiation (DIM) and the realization that it was synchrotron radiation emitted by relativistic electrons trapped in the planet's radiation belts. These synchrotron emissions were <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>estimate</b> the number and energy of the electrons around Jupiter and led to improved estimates of the magnetic moment and its tilt.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people like}} themselves; the {{birthday}} {{is associated with}} the self, and hence the numbers in the birthday are preferred, {{despite the fact that they}} appear in many other contexts. People who do not like themselves tend not to exhibit the birthday-number effect. A similar effect, the name-letter effect, has been found for letters: people tend to prefer the letters that are part of their name. The birthday-number effect and the name-letter effect are significantly correlated. In psychological assessments, the Number Preference Task is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>estimate</b> implicit self-esteem.|$|E

5|$|Near the aircraft, a {{point cloud}} in three {{dimensions}} is acquired by changing {{the orientation of the}} laser scanning sensors fixed on pan-tilt units. After filtering data to remove floor- or insufficiently large dot clusters, a registration technique with the model of the aircraft is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>estimate</b> the static orientation of the robot. The robot moves and holds this orientation by considering its wheel odometry, its inertial unit and visual odometry.|$|E
5|$|Similar to the A centers, B centers do not induce color, and no UV or visible {{absorption}} can {{be attributed}} to the B centers. Early assignment of the N9 absorption system to the B center have been disproven later. The B center has a characteristic IR absorption spectrum (see the infrared absorption picture above) with a sharp peak at 1332cm−1 and a broader feature at 1280cm−1. The latter is routinely <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>estimate</b> the nitrogen concentration in the B form.|$|E
5|$|Abortion is the {{intentional}} termination of pregnancy, {{as compared to}} spontaneous termination (miscarriage). Abortion is closely allied to contraception in terms of women's control and regulation of their reproduction, and is often subject to similar cultural, religious, legislative and economic constraints. Where access to contraception is limited, women turn to abortion. Consequently, abortion rates may be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>estimate</b> unmet needs for contraception. However the available procedures have carried great risk for women throughout most of history, and still do in the developing world, or where legal restrictions force women to seek clandestine facilities. Access to safe legal abortion places undue burdens on lower socioeconomic groups and in jurisdictions that create significant barriers. These issues have frequently {{been the subject of}} political and feminist campaigns where differing viewpoints pit health against moral values.|$|E

5|$|Alan Stern and Harold F. Levison {{introduced}} a parameter Λ (lambda), expressing {{the likelihood of}} an encounter resulting in a given deflection of orbit.

This value can be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>estimate</b> the capacity of a body to clear the neighbourhood of its orbit, where Λ > 1 will eventually clear it. A gap of five orders of magnitude in Λ was found between the smallest terrestrial planets and the largest asteroids and Kuiper belt objects.|$|E
5|$|Ava {{was also}} {{underneath}} the NOAA-2 and Nimbus 5 weather satellites. NOAA-2 provided photographs that were <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>estimate</b> Ava's maximum windspeeds. Satellite images were useful throughout the cyclone's existence, {{as did the}} wind reports of three ships when Ava was a young tropical storm. Nimbus 5 carried an Electrically Scanning Microwave Radiometer and Temperature-Humidity Infrared Radiometer. Both were used to study Ava. The main data provided by the THIR was data indicating cloud temperatures. The ESMR's main data was on rainfall rates, densities, and distributions. The observations also provided confirmation that clouds that are not vertically developed very much can produce tropical rainfall.|$|E
5|$|By late on December4, the NHC was {{no longer}} anticipating extratropical transition, after a front passed north of the storm {{and there was no}} interaction. At 0600UTC on December5, the hurricane's {{appearance}} generated 4.7 on the Dvorak technique, a system <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>estimate</b> intensity from satellite imagery. This was the highest rating during Epsilon's duration, and suggested winds of 85mph (140km/h), which was its peak intensity. Around that time, the hurricane began a turn to the east-southeast, as the ridge to its north built behind the passage of a cold front. Despite the cold water temperatures and unfavorable strong upper-level winds, Epsilon maintained its intensity, and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) model predicted it would remain a hurricane for nearly three days.|$|E
