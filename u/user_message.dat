50|$|In {{the context}} of group testing, this problem is usually tackled by {{dividing}} time into 'epochs'. We say that an user is active {{if they have a}} message at the start of an epoch. (If a message is generated during an epoch, the user only becomes active {{at the start of the}} next one.) An epoch ends when every active user has successfully transmitted their message. The problem is now to find all the active users in a given epoch, and schedule a time for them to transmit (if they have not already done so successfully). This is then a group testing problem where the query asks a set of users to attempt a transmission if they are active. The outcomes are , corresponding respectively to the possible results of a query: no active users, exactly one active <b>user</b> (<b>message</b> successful) or more than one active <b>user</b> (<b>message</b> collision).|$|E

40|$|The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a {{connection}} and message oriented transport protocol. It supports multiple uni-directional streams in each direction allowing <b>user</b> <b>message</b> sequence preservation within each stream. This minimizes the re-sequencing delay at the receiver side in case of message loss. The base protocol, although being optimized for small messages, supports arbitrary large user messages by using fragmentation and reassembly {{at the cost of}} adding delays at the sender side.

30|$|Bit U {{indicates}} that the user data carried in the chunk is unordered, meaning that the receiver can deliver the data to the application without reordering. In order to implement acknowledgments and loss or duplicate detection, data chunks have a unique transmission sequence number that is maintained at the association level. Regarding the size of user messages, SCTP may fragment a message that causes the packet to exceed the path MTU. Bit B indicates the beginning part of a <b>user</b> <b>message</b> that is fragmented, and bit E indicates the ending part. The receiving end will reassemble fragments {{in order to keep}} the message boundaries when data are finally delivered to the upper layer. As a consequence, SCTP is a message-oriented protocol, similar in this aspect to UDP, instead of a stream-oriented protocol such as TCP.|$|E
30|$|In {{an attempt}} to further improve the {{throughput}} of the framed slotted ALOHA, the authors in [6] propose the idea of transmission of several replicas of the same <b>user</b> <b>message</b> within a frame. This idea was further developed in [7], by introducing successive interference cancellation (SIC) technique which considerably increases the throughput of the framed slotted ALOHA. To this end, the receiver first resolves the collision-free packets within a frame. Then, the corresponding interferences of the these packets in other slots are canceled. By doing such, some other time slots may become interference-free which in turn results in resolving new packets. The process of resolving packets through successively canceling the interference continues until either no more time slot becomes interference-free or all the packets in that frame are resolved.|$|E

30|$|Numerous overlay CR MAC {{protocols}} {{have been}} proposed that consider unlicensed users (i.e. secondary users) opportunistically, exploiting the spectrum holes in licensed frequency bands. In overlay CR networks, secondary users can only transmit on channels if these channels are not being used by primary users. In Srinivasa and Jafar (2007) the overlay access paradigm is investigated and compared with the classical interweave access. The overlay model {{is based on the}} assumption that the secondary transmitter has a priori knowledge of the primary user’s message. Furthermore, all channel gains are known to both transmitter and receiver. Simulation results showed how the underlay technique can potentially outperform the achievable secondary network. Nevertheless, the overlay performance gain is strongly affected by the distance, as the knowledge of the licensed <b>user</b> <b>message</b> can be available at the cognitive side only if the two transmitters are located in close proximity. Moreover, complicated pre-coding techniques must be available at the cognitive transmitter, and cooperation between primary and secondary systems is necessary to estimate channel gains between transmitters and receivers.|$|E
30|$|The {{cognitive}} interference channel, {{where one}} user has full non-causal {{knowledge of the}} other <b>user’s</b> <b>message,</b> is studied in [8 – 10]. This setup is {{also referred to as}} the interference channels with degraded message sets.|$|R

30|$|Additionally, SCTP {{permits to}} bind <b>user</b> <b>messages</b> to streams {{in the context}} of an {{association}}. During the association setup, both ends negotiate the number of streams that will be used. A stream is a unidirectional sequence of messages that SCTP must deliver in order to the upper layer at the receiving end. Streams are implemented with stream identifiers and stream sequence numbers that are attached to <b>user</b> <b>messages.</b> When a transmission error occurs, the negative effects will be restricted to the streams involved in the packet loss. As a consequence, the increase in the delay due to retransmissions (head-of-line blocking) will not affect other streams. SCTP permits sending messages that bypass the normal ordered delivery. These messages are delivered as soon as they are received.|$|R
40|$|This paper studies a novel user {{cooperation}} {{method in}} a wireless powered communication network (WPCN), where {{a pair of}} distributed terminal users first harvest wireless energy broadcasted by one energy node (EN) and then use the harvested energy to transmit information cooperatively to a destination node (DN). In particular, the two cooperating users exchange their independent information {{with each other to}} form a virtual antenna array and transmit jointly to the DN. By allowing each user to allocate part of its harvested energy to transmit the other's information, the proposed cooperation can effectively mitigate the user unfairness problem in WPCNs, where a user may suffer from very low data rate due to the poor energy harvesting performance and high data transmission consumptions. We derive the maximum common throughput achieved by the cooperation scheme through optimizing the time allocation on wireless energy transfer, <b>user</b> <b>message</b> exchange, and joint information transmissions. Through comparing with some representative benchmark schemes, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed user cooperation in enhancing the throughput performance under different setups.

40|$|The {{design of}} {{efficient}} wireless fronthaul connections for future heterogeneous networks incorporating emerging paradigms such as cloud {{radio access network}} (C-RAN) has become a challenging task that requires the most effective utilization of fronthaul network resources. In this paper, we propose to use distributed compression to reduce the fronthaul traffic in uplink Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) for C-RAN. Unlike the conventional approach where each coordinating point quantizes and forwards its own observation to the processing centre, these observations are compressed before forwarding. At the processing centre, the decompression of the observations and the decoding of the <b>user</b> <b>message</b> are conducted in a successive manner. The essence {{of this approach is}} the optimization of the distributed compression using an iterative algorithm to achieve maximal user rate with a given fronthaul rate. In other words, for a target user rate the generated fronthaul traffic is minimized. Moreover, joint decompression and decoding is studied and an iterative optimization algorithm is devised accordingly. Finally, the analysis is extended to multi-user case and our results reveal that, in both dense and ultra-dense urban deployment scenarios, the usage of distributed compression can efficiently reduce the required fronthaul rate and a further reduction is obtained with joint operation...|$|E
40|$|A novel subcarrier-pair based {{opportunistic}} DF protocol {{is proposed}} for cooperative downlink OFDMA transmission {{aided by a}} decode-and-forward (DF) relay. Specifically, <b>user</b> <b>message</b> bits are transmitted in two consecutive equal-duration time slots. A subcarrier in the first slot can be paired with a subcarrier in the second slot for the DF relay-aided transmission to a user. In particular, the source and the relay can transmit simultaneously to implement beamforming at the subcarrier in the second slot for the relay-aided transmission. Each unpaired subcarrier in either {{the first or second}} slot is used by the source for direct transmission to a user without the relay's assistance. The sum rate maximized resource allocation (RA) problem is addressed for this protocol under a total power constraint. It is shown that the novel protocol leads to a maximum sum rate {{greater than or equal to}} that for a benchmark one, which does not allow the source to implement beamforming at the subcarrier in the second slot for the relay-aided transmission. Then, a polynomial-complexity RA algorithm is developed to find an (at least approximately) optimum resource allocation (i. e., source/relay power, subcarrier pairing and assignment to users) for either the proposed or benchmark protocol. Numerical experiments illustrate that the novel protocol can lead to a much greater sum rate than the benchmark one.
