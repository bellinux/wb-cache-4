40|$|This {{study focused}} on the {{evaluation}} of the machinability of different carburising steel grades by using a cemented carbide cutting tool during semi finishing of steel. The effect of the steel composition, microstructure and inclusion characteristics on the cutting tool wear in the soft part turning was evaluated for a reference steel R (0. 028 % S, 0. 0009 % O), a clean C steel (0. 003 % S, 0. 0005 % O), and an UC <b>ultra</b> <b>clean</b> <b>steel</b> (0. 002 % S, 0. 0004 % O). An improved cutting tool life of about 10 - 25 % was obtained when machining the reference steel R. The favorable machining performance of this steel was attributed to its higher content of non-metallic inclusions, larger grain size and lower micro hardness than that of the clean steels.

40|$|This {{project had}} 3 objectives: (1) to {{determine}} the kinetic factors governing inclusion removal from liquid steels at a slag metal interface; (2) to develop a methodology to enable steels of less than 1 ppm total oxygen to be produced with an average inclusion diameter of less than 5 {micro}m; and, (3) {{to determine the}} slag-metal interface conditions necessary for <b>ultra</b> <b>clean</b> <b>steels.</b> In objectives 1, and 3, the major finding was that dissolution rates of solid particles in slags {{were found to be}} significant in both ladle and tundish slags and must be included in a model to predict steel cleanliness. The work towards objective 2 indicated that liquid steel temperature was a very significant factor in our understanding of <b>clean</b> <b>steel</b> potential and that undercooled steels equilibrated with low oxygen potential inert gases have the potential to be significantly cleaner than current steels.

40|$|ConocoPhillips, in {{conjunction}} with Nexant Inc., Penn State University, and Cummins Engine Co., joined with the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) in a cooperative agreement to perform a comprehensive study of new <b>ultra</b> <b>clean</b> fuels (UCFs) produced from remote sources of natural gas. The project study consists of three primary tasks: an environmental Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), a Market Study, {{and a series of}} Engine Tests to evaluate the potential markets for <b>Ultra</b> <b>Clean</b> Fuels. The overall objective of DOE's <b>Ultra</b> <b>Clean</b> Transportation Fuels Initiative is to develop and deploy technologies that will produce ultra-clean burning transportation fuels for the 21 st century from both petroleum and non-petroleum resources. These fuels will: (1) Enable vehicles to comply with future emission requirements; (2) Be compatible with the existing liquid fuels infrastructure; (3) Enable vehicle efficiencies to be significantly increased, with concomitantly reduced CO{sub 2 } emissions; (4) Be obtainable from a fossil resource, alone or in combination with other hydrocarbon materials such as refinery wastes, municipal wastes, biomass, and coal; and (5) Be competitive with current petroleum fuels. The objectives of the ConocoPhillips <b>Ultra</b> <b>Clean</b> Fuels Project are to perform a comprehensive life cycle analysis and to conduct a market study on <b>ultra</b> <b>clean</b> fuels of commercial interest produced from natural gas, and, in addition, perform engine tests for Fisher-Tropsch diesel and methanol in neat, blended or special formulations to obtain data on emissions. This resulting data will be used to optimize fuel compositions and engine operation in order to minimize the release of atmospheric pollutants resulting from the fuel combustion. Development and testing of both direct and indirect methanol fuel cells was to be conducted and the optimum properties of a suitable fuel-grade methanol was to be defined. The results of the study are also applicable to coal-derived FT liquid fuels.

Not only is hydrogen necessary to upgrade low quality crude oils to high-quality, low sulfur <b>ultra</b> <b>clean</b> transportation fuels, hydrogen could eventually replace gasoline and diesel as the <b>ultra</b> <b>clean</b> transportation fuel of the future. Currently, refinery hydrogen is produced through the steam reforming of natural gas. Although efficient, the process is responsible for a significant portion of refinery CO 2 emissions. This project is examining the direct catalytic decomposition of methane as an alternative to steam reforming. The energy required to produce one mole of hydrogen is slightly lower and the process does not require water-gas-shift or pressure-swing adsorption units. The decomposition process does not produce CO 2 emissions and the product is not contaminated with CO [...] a poison for PEM fuel cells. In this work we examined the direct catalytic decomposition of methane over a metal modified zeolite catalyst and the recovery of catalyst activity by calcination. A favorable production of hydrogen was obtained, when compared with previously reported nickel-zeolite supported catalysts. Reaction temperature had a strong influence on catalyst activity and on the type of carbon deposits.

40|$|A {{frequent}} problem {{within the}} textile conservation field {{is the need}} to wash artefacts which are not made for washing. This thesis identifies the problems often encountered during wet cleaning in regard to dyes and colours with poor wash-fastness. A literature study pinpoints which dyes and dyeing techniques frequently yields poor wash-fastness results and looks at some possible techniques used currently and in the past to solve the problem. The properties and history of cyklododecane is presented, and its possible use in textile conservation in a melted state as a single isolating agent is explored, as well as in combination with Paraloid B 72 in the dual-layer technique designed by Salvador Muñoz- Viñas for paper conservation. The workings of <b>ultra</b> <b>clean</b> water is explained. Different dye techniques were used to produce yarn with intentional poor wash-fastness; reactive dye, water soluble ink, saffron and vat dye. Samples were prepared, embroidery on cotton, and then subjected to different treatments: a) water (control), b) water + detergent (Berol 784) (control), c) cyclododecane + water + detergent, d) cyclododecane + paraloid b 72 + water + detergent and e) <b>ultra</b> <b>clean</b> water, with one set of samples left untreated. Blotting papers were used to control the bleeding. The results were analysed in a microscope, and documented via photography. The outcomes were compared to one another and the results considered.

40|$|The modern <b>steel</b> {{plants for}} <b>clean</b> <b>steel</b> {{production}} depend to large extent on {{the efficiency of}} the refining processes that applied for the production. Refining processes that applied for low alloy and alloyed steel production include degassing via vacuum or ladle and ladle furnace units. This technique could help in producing homogeneous steel with low gas content and minimum internal defects. In certain grades of steel for tools and penetration and impact resistance uses, non-metallic inclusions (NMI) and sulphur content are the key factors for the steel performance and applications. ESR, Electro-salg refining (or remelting), is the technique that can efficiently produce <b>clean</b> <b>steel</b> with minimum content of NMI and sulphur due to the special nature and mechanism of this technique.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{systematic}} {{experimental studies of}} the temperature dependence of the resistivity {{in a variety of}} dilute, <b>ultra</b> <b>clean</b> two dimensional electron/hole systems have revived the fundamental question of localization or, alternatively, the existence of a metal-insulator transition in the presence of strong electron-electron interactions in two dimensions. We argue that under the extreme conditions of <b>ultra</b> <b>clean</b> systems not only is the electron-electron interaction very strong but the role of other system specific properties are also enhanced. In particular, we emphasize the role of valleys in determining the transport properties of the dilute electron gas in silicon inversion layers (Si-MOSFETs). It is shown that for a high quality sample the temperature behavior of the resistivity in the region close to the critical region of the metal-insulator transition is well described by a renormalization group analysis of the interplay of interaction and disorder if the electron band is assumed to have two distinct valleys. The decrease in the resistivity up to five times has been captured in the correct temperature interval by this analysis, without involving any adjustable parameters. The considerable variance in the data obtained from different Si-MOSFET samples is attributed to the sample dependent scattering rate across the two valleys, presenting thereby with a possible explanation for the absence of universal behavior in Si-MOSFET samples of different quality...|$|R
