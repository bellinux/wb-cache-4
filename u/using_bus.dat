5|$|The Copenhagen S-Train, Copenhagen Metro (in service 24/7) and the {{regional}} train networks are used by {{about half of the}} city's passengers, the remainder <b>using</b> <b>bus</b> services. Nørreport Station near the city centre serves passengers travelling by main-line rail, S-train, regional train, metro and bus. Some 750,000 passengers make use of public transport facilities every day. Copenhagen Central Station is the hub of the DSB railway network serving Denmark and international destinations.|$|E
5|$|SeaTac/Airport {{station is}} also served by five bus routes <b>using</b> <b>bus</b> stops on International Boulevard {{to the east}} of the station. King County Metro {{operates}} three routes from the station: the RapidRide A Line, which continues north to Tukwila International Boulevard station and south to Federal Way Transit Center; route 156, which connects to Southcenter Mall, Des Moines and Highline College; and route 180, which connects to Burien, Kent and Auburn. Sound Transit runs two express bus routes to the station and airport terminal: route 560, which travels to West Seattle, Burien, Renton and Bellevue; and route 574, which travels south to Tacoma and Lakewood in Pierce County.|$|E
25|$|In {{an effort}} to provide service {{intermediate}} in speed and capacity between subways and buses, the MBTA has begun projects <b>using</b> <b>Bus</b> Rapid Transit (BRT) technology. The MBTA has one BRT line, the Silver Line, although this operates in two discontinuous sections. The Silver Line operates in part via dedicated trolleybus tunnel, in part via on-street reserved bus lanes, and in part mixed with general street traffic. Service through the trolleybus tunnel is by dual-mode buses, which operate electrically in the tunnel and within a short section on the surface, and which use diesel power {{for the rest of}} the route.|$|E

50|$|METRO {{has a very}} {{expansive}} {{and heavily}} <b>used</b> <b>bus</b> system. Local bus service usually runs on city streets, stopping at every other corner along its entire route. METRO's bus service is the most <b>used</b> <b>bus</b> system in Texas and the Southwest. METRO's bus service also includes the HOV/Park and Ride system. Park and Ride stations are placed alongside the freeways and used heavily during peak times.|$|R

25|$|Due to no {{funding from}} the state of Georgia and its limited funding from Fulton, Clayton and DeKalb counties, MARTA has {{struggled}} for many years to provide adequate service to the metropolitan area. As a result, MARTA has gained a notorious reputation throughout the metro Atlanta area for being ineffective and inconvenient. Many people who own cars avoid using the system altogether while residents in suburban areas usually drive their car to a MARTA rail station (instead of <b>using</b> <b>bus</b> service) if their job is near an adjacent one. MARTA's financial structure (being tied to a 1% sales tax) has forced the agency to cut services during times of economic depression, further resulting in complaints about the inconvenience and inadequacy of MARTA services.|$|E
2500|$|The Pacer {{series was}} the result of an {{experiment}} to see whether the possibility of <b>using</b> <b>bus</b> parts to create a diesel multiple unit was viable. The initial prototype, known as LEV-1, was a joint project by the British Rail Research Division and Leyland Motors using a bus body mounted on a modification of an existing freight vehicle underframe (HSFV1). This was followed by the two-car prototype class 140, which was built in 1980 at British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL)'s [...] Derby Litchurch Lane Works.|$|E
2500|$|Although the Pacer is economical, {{there are}} {{limitations}} to <b>using</b> <b>bus</b> parts for railway use. Instead {{of the more}} usual bogies, Pacers use a basic four-wheel two-axle configuration. The lack of articulation {{can result in a}} rough ride, especially over points and around tight curves. Other performance problems include poor acceleration and poor reliability for some units. On a section of line between Northwich and Greenbank in Cheshire the speed limit is [...] but could be raised to [...] if Pacers were banned from the line. [...] The basic bus bench seating can also be uncomfortable, whilst the suspension has given rise to the nickname [...] "nodding donkeys" [...] due to the up and down motion on uneven track. [...] The inward-opening doors similar to those found on buses can be unreliable, and the two-step entrance can make loading slower and harder for elderly people and wheelchair users.|$|E
