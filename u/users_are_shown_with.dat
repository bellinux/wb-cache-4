50|$|BitlBee {{communicates}} {{with the}} user via the IRC protocol, providing {{a gateway to}} popular chat networks such as AIM and ICQ (via OSCAR), Microsoft Messenger service (via MSNP), Yahoo! (via YMSG) and Google Talk and Facebook Messenger (via MQTT with a plugin) and the microblogging networks Twitter, Identi.ca, and GNU Social. Since version 3.0, BitlBee can be built to use the libpurple library, which supports file transfers on many IM networks, and supports GaduGadu, QQ and other less well-known protocols. Off-the-record messaging is supported by Bitlbee. It supports the display of remote user status using the IRC voice attribute: online <b>users</b> <b>are</b> <b>shown</b> <b>with</b> voice, away users are shown without. Many IRC commands such as /WHO and /QUERY are available, though {{the capabilities of the}} remote IM protocols limit which IRC commands will work.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} case study on using geo-location {{information}} to help users navigate an online forum for farmers. Working with newfarm. org, we ran a controlled experiment where maps were added to each thread on the forum. One group of <b>users</b> <b>was</b> <b>shown</b> maps <b>with</b> the location of all the thread's viewers; another group the location of both viewers and posters. We then measured how the maps affected users’ viewing behavior. For the most trafficked threads, we found that maps showing posters noticeably increased geographic clustering of viewers. However, interviews with forum users revealed that other information, such as soil type or climatic zone, would be more useful for navigating content. Consequently, we believe that further investigation will reveal how best to design contextually-relevant navigation elements.

40|$|A new {{subcarrier}} combining {{technique is}} proposed for MC -CDMA receiver in mobile Rayleigh fading channel. It exploits the structure formed by repeating spreading sequences of users on different subcarriers to simultaneously suppress multiple access interference (MAI) and provide implicit channel tracking without {{any knowledge of}} the channel amplitudes or training sequences. This is achieved by adaptively weighting each subcarrier in each symbol period by employing a simple gradient descent algorithm to meet the constant modulus (CM) criterion with judicious selection of step-size. Improved BER and <b>user</b> capacity performance <b>are</b> <b>shown</b> <b>with</b> similar complexity in order of O(N) compared with conventional maximum ratio combining and equal gain combining techniques even under high channel Doppler rates...|$|R

Volume segmentation {{is important in}} many applications, particularly in the medical domain. Most segmentation techniques, however, work fully automatically only in very restricted scenarios and cumbersome manual editing of the results is a common task. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for the editing of segmentation results. Our method exploits structural features of the segmented object to enable intuitive and robust correction and verification. We demonstrate that our new approach can significantly increase the segmentation quality even in difficult cases {{such as in the}} presence of severe pathologies.

40|$|We {{consider}} downlink transmission in {{a cellular}} network consisting of multi-antenna base stations (BSs), single-antenna mobile users, directional antennas {{each with a}} vertically adjustable beam, and control signaling delays in feedback and backhaul links. We propose a novel transmission technique in which intercell interference management is performed via coordinating the beamforming jointly in the horizontal and vertical planes of the wireless channel, denoted as coordinated 3 D beamforming. In the horizontal plane, we focus on intercell interference cancelation (ICIC) and investigate its performance when the provided channel state information (CSI) is impaired due to delay/mobility. It is demonstrated that the superiority of ICIC over conventional intracell maximum ratio transmission is highly dependent on the CSI accuracy. In the vertical plane, we consider intercell interference control via coordinatively adapting the elevation angle of the BS antenna pattern, denoted as tilt, to {{the locations of the}} scheduled <b>users.</b> It <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> that <b>with</b> perfect CSI interference management should be performed in the horizontal plane using ICIC, while at high delay/mobility it should be done in the vertical plane via coordinated tilt adaptation. For intermediate values of delay/mobility, joint interference management in both planes is required...|$|R
40|$|The {{recent trends}} of {{densification}} and centralized signal processing in radio access networks suggest that future networks may comprise ubiquitous antennas coordinated {{to form a}} network-wide gigantic array, {{referred to as the}} ubiquitous array (UA). In this paper, the UA communication techniques are designed and analyzed based on a geometric model. Specifically, the UA is modeled as a continuous circular/spherical array enclosing target users and free-space propagation is assumed. First, consider the estimation of multiuser UA channels induced by user locations. Given single pilot symbols, a novel channel estimation scheme is proposed that decomposes training signals into Fourier/Laplace series and thereby translates multiuser channel estimation into peak detection of a derive function of location. The process <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> to suppress noise. Moreover, it is proved that estimation error due to interference diminishes with the increasing minimum user-separation distance following the power law, where the exponent is 1 / 3 and 1 for the circular and spherical UA, respectively. If orthogonal pilot sequences are used, channel estimation is found to be perfect. Next, consider channel-conjugate data transmission that maximizes received signal power. The power of interference between two <b>users</b> <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> to decay <b>with</b> the increasing user-separation distance sub-linearly and super-linearly for the circular and spherical UA, respectively. Furthermore, a novel multiuser precoding design is proposed by exciting different phase modes of the UA and controlling the mode weight factors to null interference. The number of available degrees of freedom for interference nulling using the UA is proved to be proportional to the minimum user-separation distance.

40|$|Vario-scale data {{structures}} make {{it possible}} to derive maps at arbitrary scale. When requesting a map, data has to be transferred from server to client. This takes time, which affects the responsiveness of the system, and sometimes costs can be involved for every byte that is send over the network. Redundant data transfers should thus be avoided. Having vario-scale data, the opportunity arises to reuse data already present on the client and retrieve only the missing data from the server when requesting a new map. This thesis explores if a generic data driven spatial access method can be used for this purpose, while keeping the service scalable and responsive. The research <b>shows</b> that there <b>is</b> no ready-made solution available that can facilitate in reaching this goal, but that the Hilbert R-tree is suited {{to be used as a}} starting point. Like the generic Hilbert R-tree, an index is build using a space filling curve. However, instead of indexing individual objects, an index is made based on a set of objects. The objects are grouped together into packages based on spatial proximity and level of detail. Using the index, a client can request these packages over the network. The newly suggested method makes it possible to utilize client side processing for constructing vario-scale maps and thereby use the client cache to reuse already received responses. The results show that the efficiency of data communication and the responsiveness of the client can improve for an average <b>user</b> scenario. This <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> <b>with</b> the use of a prototype. Furthermore, the method is generic for the way in which data is retrieved by a client from the server. Therefore, the hypothesis is that the method can also facilitate communication for other use cases with higher dimensional data such as 4 D point clouds. It is expected that communication can be similar as with vario-scale data, and that only the filter and visualization steps are different.
