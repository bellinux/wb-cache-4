500|$|The {{mens rea}} {{requirement}} {{is that the}} defendant must have intend to, or recklessly, cause the victim to fear the possibility of immediate <b>unlawful</b> <b>violence.</b> There is no authority that suggests that [...] "intend" [...] or [...] "recklessly" [...] ought to mean something from their normal meanings. Cunningham recklessness [...] that the defendant himself foresaw the risk of harm [...] is applied. Assault is a crime of [...] "basic intent" [...] {{for the purposes of}} the Majewski test concerning voluntary intoxication.|$|E
500|$|A {{distinction}} is drawn betwixt the offence of assault {{and that of}} battery. Assault is the apprehension {{of the possibility of}} immediate <b>unlawful</b> <b>violence,</b> and battery that of the infliction of such violence. Several proposals, including one from the Criminal Law Revision Committee in 1980 have proposed merging the offences. However, the distinction was confirmed in DPP v Little in 1992. There, the conflation of assault and battery was criticised as duplicitous. If D throws a punch at V, who dodges, this is likely to be an assault but not a battery; if V is attacked from behind, this may constitute a battery without an assault. Actions which constitute ordinary daily life are not considered assault or battery, for example, jostling on a crowded train. The term [...] "common assault" [...] is used to refer to either a technical assault or a battery.|$|E
500|$|The British {{government}} submitted {{that the}} killings were [...] "absolutely necessary", within {{the meaning of}} Article 2, paragraph 2, to protect the people of Gibraltar from <b>unlawful</b> <b>violence,</b> because the soldiers who carried out the shootings genuinely believed that McCann, Savage, and Farrell were capable of detonating a car bomb, and of doing so by remote control. The families contested the government's claim, alleging that the government had conspired to kill the three; that the planning and control of the operation was flawed; that the inquest was not adequately equipped to investigate the killings; and that the applicable laws of Gibraltar were not compliant with Article 2 of the ECHR. The court found that the soldiers' [...] "reflex action" [...] in resorting to lethal force was excessive, but that the soldiers' actions did not—in their own right—give rise to a violation of Article 2. The court held that the soldiers' use of force based on an honestly held belief (that the suspects were armed or in possession of a remote detonator) could be justified, even if that belief was later found to be mistaken. To hold otherwise would, in the court's opinion, place too great a burden on law-enforcement personnel. It also dismissed all other allegations, except that regarding the planning and control of the operation. In that respect, the court found that the authorities' failure to arrest the suspects as they crossed the border or earlier, combined with the information that was passed to the soldiers, rendered the use of lethal force almost inevitable. Thus, the court decided there had been a violation of Article 2 in the control of the operation.|$|E

2500|$|If the Public Prosecutor {{applies to}} the High Court and shows that [...] "the issue or {{circulation}} of a seditious publication is or if commenced or continued {{would be likely to}} lead to <b>unlawful</b> <b>violence</b> or appears to have the object of promoting feelings of hostility between different classes or races of the community", the Court is required to issue an order [...] "prohibiting the issuing and circulation of that publication... and requiring every person having any copy of the prohibited publication in his possession, power or control forthwith to deliver every such copy into the custody of the police". It is an offence to fail to deliver a prohibited publication to a police officer on being served a prohibition order, or if it comes to one's knowledge that he or she has a prohibited publication in his or her possession, power or control. The punishment is a fine of up to $1,000 or jail for up to one year or both.|$|E
2500|$|The {{relatives}} of McCann, Savage and Farrell were {{dissatisfied with the}} response to their case in the British legal system, so they took their case to the European Court of Human Rights in 1995. The court found that the three had been unlawfully killed. By a 10–9 majority it ruled that {{the human rights of}} the 'Gibraltar Three' had been infringed in breach of Article 2 – right to life, of the European Convention on Human Rights and criticised the authorities for lack of appropriate care in the control and organisation of the arrest operation. In sum, having regard to the decision not to prevent the suspects from travelling into Gibraltar, to the failure of the authorities to make sufficient allowances for the possibility that their intelligence assessments might, in some respects at least, be erroneous and to the automatic recourse to lethal force when the soldiers opened fire, the Court is not persuaded that the killing of the three terrorists constituted the use of force which was no more than absolutely necessary in defence of persons from <b>unlawful</b> <b>violence</b> within the meaning of Article 2(2)(a) of the Convention ...|$|E

If any mischief come in such cases, it is not to be charged upon him who defends his own right, but on him that invades his neighbours. If the innocent honest man must quietly quit all he has, for peace sake, to him who will lay violent hands upon it, I desire it may be considered, what a kind of peace there will be in the world, which consists only in violence and rapine; and which is to be maintained only for the benefit of robbers and oppressors. Who would not think it an admirable peace betwix the mighty and the mean, when the lamb, without resistance, yielded his throat to be torn by the imperious wolf? Polyphemus's den gives us a perfect pattern of such a peace, and such a government, wherein Ulysses and his companions had nothing to do, but quietly to suffer themselves to be devoured. And no doubt Ulysses, who was a prudent man, preached up passive obedience, and exhorted them to a quiet submission, by representing to them of what concernment peace was to mankind; and by shewing the inconveniences might happen, if they should offer to resist Polyphemus, who had now the power over them.|$|E
