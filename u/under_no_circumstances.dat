5|$|Despite the {{endorsement}} of Admiral Sims, the Navy Department initially rejected the British request. Like other navies of the late-19th and early-20th centuries, the U.S. Navy rigidly adhered to the doctrine of Alfred Thayer Mahan, whose first tenet was that <b>under</b> <b>no</b> <b>circumstances</b> should a battle fleet be divided. U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral William S. Benson and Admiral Henry T. Mayo—Commander of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet—were particularly worried that if Britain fell, as developments at sea suggested it might, the U.S. Navy would be left to face the German High Seas Fleet completely on its own.|$|E
5|$|The Vigil Honor is a {{recognition}} given to Arrowmen for distinguished contributions {{beyond the immediate}} responsibilities of their position or office to their lodge, the Order of the Arrow, Scouting, or their Scout Camp. The Vigil Honor may be conferred upon Arrowmen who have completed {{a minimum of two}} years as a Brotherhood member and have performed exceptional service above and beyond their immediate responsibilities through leadership, exemplary efforts, and dedication. However, <b>under</b> <b>no</b> <b>circumstances</b> should tenure in Scouting or the Order of the Arrow be considered as reason enough for a Vigil Honor recommendation.

5|$|At a September 10, 2008, press conference, Paul {{announced}} his general support of four third-party candidates: Cynthia McKinney (Green Party); Bob Barr (Libertarian Party); Chuck Baldwin (Constitution Party); and Ralph Nader (independent). He said {{that each of}} them had pledged to adhere to a policy of balancing budgets, bringing the troops home, defending privacy and personal liberties, and investigating the Federal Reserve. Paul also said that <b>under</b> <b>no</b> <b>circumstances</b> would he be endorsing {{either of the two}} main parties' candidates (McCain– Republican Party, or Obama– Democratic Party) because there were no real differences between them, and because neither of them, if elected, would seek to make the fundamental changes in governance that were necessary. He urged instead that, rather than contribute to the “charade” that the two-party election system had become, the voters support the third-party candidates as a protest vote, to force change in the election process. Later that same day, Paul gave a televised interview with Nader saying much the same again.|$|E

25|$|The Cathars' main heresy {{was their}} belief in dualism: the evil God created the materialistic world and the good God created the spiritual world.

40|$|Introduction: As {{the society}} rapidly ages, {{planning}} {{for health care}} towards the end-of-life is important for older people and their families. This study examined the attitudes towards end-of-life care amongst near-centenarians and centenarians, {{and the influence of}} frailty status on these attitudes. Method: Data for 131 participants (76 % female, mean age 97. 5, range 95 - 108 years) were extracted from the Hong Kong Centenarian Study. 80 % of the participants were community-dwelling (49 % with family, 31 % alone), whilst the remaining 20 % were institutionalized. Participants were asked to indicate their agreement on three items: (a) the society’s acceptance on advance directives; (b) the society’s acceptance on euthanasia; and (c) the idea that <b>under</b> <b>no</b> <b>circumstance</b> should anybody seek to hasten death. We assessed frailty status using a multidimensional model including items on physical health, psychological well-being, socio-familial conditions, environmental barriers to social activities, and economic conditions. Multiple regressions were performed {{to examine the relationship between}} frailty status and attitudes towards end-of-life care. Results: 69 % and 60 % of the 131 participants believed that the society did not accept advance directives and euthanasia, respectively; and 89 % believed that <b>under</b> <b>no</b> <b>circumstance</b> should one hasten death. Centenarians with higher levels of frailty were more likely to believe in acceptance of advance directives (beta=. 23), euthanasia (beta=. 26) and <b>under</b> <b>no</b> <b>circumstance</b> should anybody seek to hasten death (beta=. 21), after controlling for the effects of gender, age, and living arrangement. Conclusion: Acceptance of advance directives and euthanasia is low amongst community-dwelling extremely old adults in Hong Kong, and the vast majority do not believe in hastening death under any circumstances. However, these attitudes are significantly influenced by their frailty status. Further studies are needed to compare with the attitudes amongst younger-old adults. Greater efforts in raising public awareness about the end-of-life care options are warranted to facilitate choices and autonomy in the final phase of their lives...|$|R

The Chinese Government has always maintained that <b>under</b> <b>no</b> <b>circumstances</b> will China use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon States or nuclear-weapon-free zones.

25|$|Mathematically, the Higgs {{field has}} {{imaginary}} mass {{and is therefore}} a tachyonic field.

Instead of faster-than-light particles, the imaginary mass creates an instability: Any configuration in which one or more field excitations are tachyonic must spontaneously decay, and the resulting configuration contains no physical tachyons. This process is known as tachyon condensation, and is now believed to be the explanation for how the Higgs mechanism itself arises in nature, and therefore the reason behind electroweak symmetry breaking.|$|E

25|$|The {{weapon was}} moved long {{distances}} via rail on {{a variant of}} a Schnabel car; the whole chassis was hung between two huge pedestal-mounted swiveling arms fixed to five-axle bogies. When it reached its destination, the weapon was detached from its supporting arms, driven to its intended firing location, then the chassis was lowered to the ground by lowering the suspension on its continuous track units' roadwheels on each side to distribute the recoil forces more evenly in preparation for firing. The Karl-Gerät proved to have no problems moving over normal soil, but <b>under</b> <b>no</b> <b>circumstances</b> was it allowed to make turns on soft soil lest it throw a track.

25|$|In {{order to}} uphold the Senjinkun {{military}} code, it was considered extremely dishonourable to become an enemy prisoner in Japan at the time, even in a situation as desperate as the one faced by the Japanese Army in New Guinea. In the Japanese Army Penal Code, commanding officers ordering their troops to surrender {{was treated as a}} form of desertion, and even when troops gave their all in battle, surrender was still punishable by six months' imprisonment (article 41). Lieutenant General Hatazō Adachi, commander of the 18th Army, also gave an order on 18 March 1945, telling his soldiers that they should <b>under</b> <b>no</b> <b>circumstances</b> bring upon themselves the shame of being taken prisoner. As a result, examples of the Japanese Army surrendering as a group are extremely rare. Apart from Takenaga's unit, the only other examples of group surrender by the Japanese Army in the Pacific War were two other groups in New Guinea that are discussed below, and the Army Naval Raiding Squadron, commanded by Umezawa and defending Zamami Island, in the Battle of Okinawa. However, Takenaga's unit was not the first example; there was a previous incident in May, 1905, at the Battle of Mukden in the Russo-Japanese War, where 42 survivors of a company of the 49th Infantry Regiment of the 1st Division were all taken prisoner.|$|E
