25|$|Due to {{medications}} given before, during, {{and after}} a surgery, a patient may sometimes not remember interactions with the anaesthetist, nurse anaesthetist, or anaesthesia assistant involved in his anaesthesia care. The anaesthetic plan, as well as alternatives, risks, and benefits of the chosen anaesthetic techniques, should be discussed with the patient prior to the surgery. This can be difficult or impossible in some situations, such as with unconscious patients, confused patients, or extremely <b>urgent</b> <b>cases.</b>|$|E

The earliest predecessor of the Cabinet was arguably the Executive Council of the Straits Settlements that was introduced in 1877 by letters patent issued by the Crown, though its function was very different from that of today's Cabinet.

2500|$|In its beginnings, {{the council}} {{was a place}} of debate amongst the ministers over {{government}} policy. However, since the formation of real political parties {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, these debates were moved from the council to informal ministerial meetings where government policy could be coordinated – usually held every Wednesday. As a result, the primary function of the council today is to grant royal assent, which is done by the counter-signatures of the sovereign and a minister. Before granting the assent, a relevant minister explains the general aim of the bill brought before the council. According to section 22 of the Danish constitution, a bill must be granted assent within thirty days of its passing by parliament, at the latest, for it to become an Act. In <b>urgent</b> <b>cases,</b> or if a passed law will be in conflict with this time limit if only signed at the next scheduled council meeting, the responsible minister for the law is also allowed to visit the royal institution at a separate meeting ahead of the scheduled council meeting, and ask for royal assent. [...] The sovereign cannot be held responsible for any granted assent.|$|E
2500|$|The {{middle of}} the century was marked by the dissensions between the Kann and Kulp parties. The Kulp party, to which many {{influential}} men belonged, endeavored to harmonize the ancient constitution of the community with new measures {{for the benefit of}} the people; but their efforts were thwarted by the wealthy Kann family, whose influence was predominant both in the government of the community and among the people. In 1750 the two parties effected a compromise, which was, however, of but short duration. The community was further excited by Jonathan Eybeschütz's amulet controversy. In 1756 the Jews received permission to leave their street in <b>urgent</b> <b>cases</b> on Sundays and feast days for the purpose of fetching a physician or a barber or mailing a letter, but they were required to return by the shortest way. In 1766 the Cleve divorce controversy began to excite the rabbinate of Frankfurt also. At the coronation of Joseph II. the Frankfurt Jews were permitted for the first time to appear in public, when they swore allegiance to the emperor (May 28, 1764). The community of Frankfurt rendered great service in suppressing Eisenmenger's [...] "Entdecktes Judenthum", confiscating all the copies in 1700. Eisenmenger sued the community for 30,000 gulden. Although he lost his case, proceedings were several times renewed with the aid of King Frederick I of Prussia, and only in 1773 was the community finally released from all claims brought by Eisenmenger's heirs.|$|E

60|$|There {{was indeed}} {{much to be}} done. Four of the knights were told off to attend upon the most <b>urgent</b> <b>cases</b> among their own wounded.

As fast as the slaves' fetters were struck off, food and wine were given to them, together with such garments as could {{be found at the}} moment. Then the bodies of the fallen pirates were thrown overboard, while the wounded were attended to, and the released Christians were divided equally between the three prizes. To each of these the knights of one of the langues were told off, the seniors being appointed to the command. There were in all some ninety Christian captives on board the three ships. Thus each vessel had a complement of seven knights and thirty Christians, and to these were added ten of the thirty Moslems found at the oars, and fifteen of the pirates to whom quarter had been given.|$|E
6000|$|I found Henry {{stretched}} upon {{a mattress}} {{on the floor of a}} great building, along with thirty or forty other scalded and wounded persons, and was promptly informed, by some indiscreet person, that he had inhaled steam; that his body was badly scalded, and that he would live but a little while; also, I was told that the physicians and nurses were giving their whole attention to persons who had a chance of being saved. They were short-handed in the matter of physicians and nurses; and Henry and such others as were considered to be fatally hurt were receiving only such attention as could be spared, from time to time, from the more <b>urgent</b> <b>cases.</b> But Dr. Peyton, a fine and large-hearted old physician of great reputation in the community, gave me his sympathy and took vigorous hold of the case, and in about a week he had brought Henry around. Dr. Peyton never committed himself with prognostications which might not materialize, but at eleven o'clock one night he told me that Henry was out of danger, and would get well. Then he said, [...] "At midnight these poor fellows lying here and there all over this place will begin to mourn and mutter and lament and make outcries, and if this commotion should disturb Henry it will be bad for him; therefore ask the physician on watch to give him an eighth of a grain of morphine, but this is not to be done unless Henry shall show signs that he is being disturbed." ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an improved generalized force model (IGFM) that considers the driver’s comfortable driving behavior. Through theoretical analysis, we propose the calculation methods of comfortable driving distance and velocity.

Furthermore, the simulation results show that IGFM can predict correct delay time of car motion and kinematic wave speed at jam density, and it can exactly describe the driver’s behavior under an <b>urgent</b> <b>case,</b> where no collision occurs. The dynamic properties of IGFM also indicate that stability has improved compared to the generalized force model...|$|R

We then briefly examine the programme and research implications of such a framework for interventions aimed at improving education and health, with specific reference to young Indigenous Australians. We find that while education and health are inextricably linked, throughout the life course and at different levels of influence, there is less empirical work exploring this relationship in an Indigenous context. Given the gravity of literacy and numeracy failure rates in school-based education and its potential impact on Indigenous health, we assert an <b>urgent</b> <b>case</b> for rigorous research into interventions that address the barriers to effectiveness in implementing quality educational experiences and opportunities for Indigenous children...|$|R
