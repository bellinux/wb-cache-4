50|$|Nonadiabatic {{transition}} state theory (NA-TST) is {{a powerful}} tool to predict rates of chemical reactions from a computational standpoint. NA-TST has been introduced in 1988 by Prof. J.C. Lorquet. In general, all of the assumptions taking place in traditional transition state theory (TST) are also used in NA-TST but with some corrections. Firstly, {{the assumption that the}} reaction proceeds through the TS is replaced by a new one when TS is replaced by minimum energy crossing point (MECP). Secondly, by contrast with TST, the probability of transition is not equal to unity during the reaction and treated as a function of internal energy associated with the reaction coordinate. At this stage non-relativistic couplings responsible for mixing between states affect the probability of transition. For example, the larger spin-orbit coupling at MECP the larger the probability of transition. NA-TST can be reduced to the traditional TST in the limit of <b>unit</b> <b>probability.</b>|$|E

40|$|A recent {{development}} in the hybrid HMM/ANN speech recognition paradigm {{is the use of}} several subword classifiers, each of which provides different information about the speech signal. Although the combining methods have obtained promising results, the strategies so far proposed have been relatively simple. In most cases frame-level subword <b>unit</b> <b>probabilities</b> are combined using an unweighted product or sum rule. In this paper, we argue and empirically demonstrate that the classifier combination approach can benefit from a dynamically weighted combination rule, where the weights are derived from higher-than-frame-level confidence values. 1.

40|$|Sample {{coordination}} maximizes or {{minimizes the}} overlap {{of two or}} more samples selected from overlapping populations. It can be applied to designs with simultaneous or sequential selection of samples. We propose a method for sample coordination in the former case. We consider the case where units are to be selected with maximum overlap using two designs with given <b>unit</b> inclusion <b>probabilities.</b> The degree of coordination is measured by the expected sample overlap, which is bounded above by a theoretical bound, called the absolute upper bound, and which depends on the <b>unit</b> inclusion <b>probabilities.</b> If the expected overlap equals the absolute upper bound, the sample coordination is maximal. Most of the methods given in the literature consider fixed marginal sampling designs, but in many cases, the absolute upper bound is not achieved. We propose to construct optimal sampling designs for given <b>unit</b> inclusion <b>probabilities</b> in order to realize maximal coordination. Our method is based on some theoretical conditions on joint selection probability of two samples and on the controlled selection method with linear programming implementation.

40|$|Current {{automatic}} {{speech recognition}} systems make use of a single {{source of information about}} their input, viz. a preprocessed form of the acoustic speech signal, which encodes the timefrequency distribution of signal energy. The goal of this thesis is to investigate the benefits of integrating articulatory information into state-of-the art speech recognizers, either as a genuine alternative to standard acoustic representations, or as an additional source of information. Articulatory information is represented in terms of abstract articulatory classes or "features", which are extracted from the speech signal by means of statistical classifiers. A higher-level classifier then combines the scores for these features and maps them to standard subword <b>unit</b> <b>probabilities.</b> The main motivation for this approach is to improve the robustness of speech recognition systems in adverse acoustic environments, such as background noise.
