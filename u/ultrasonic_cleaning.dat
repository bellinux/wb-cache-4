40|$|Background Dinoflagellate cysts (i. e., dinocysts) are biologically and ecologically {{important}} {{as they can}} help dinoflagellate species survive harsh environments, facilitate their dispersal and serve as seeds for harmful algal blooms. In addition, dinocysts derived from some species can produce more toxins than vegetative forms, largely affecting species through their food webs and even human health. Consequently, accurate identification of dinocysts represents the first crucial step in many ecological studies. As dinocysts have limited or even no available taxonomic keys, molecular methods have become the first priority for dinocyst identification. However, molecular identification of dinocysts, particularly when using single cells, poses technical challenges. The most serious is the low success rate of PCR, especially for heterotrophic species. Methods In this study, we aim to improve the success rate of single dinocyst identification for the chosen dinocyst species (Gonyaulax spinifera, Polykrikos kofoidii, Lingulodinium polyedrum, Pyrophacus steinii, Protoperidinium leonis and Protoperidinium oblongum) distributed in the South China Sea. We worked on two major technical issues: cleaning possible PCR inhibitors attached on the cyst surface and designing new dinoflagellate-specific PCR primers to improve the success of PCR amplification. Results For the cleaning of single dinocysts separated from marine sediments, we used <b>ultrasonic</b> wave-based <b>cleaning</b> and optimized cleaning parameters. Our {{results showed that the}} optimized <b>ultrasonic</b> wave-based <b>cleaning</b> method largely improved the identification success rate and accuracy of both molecular and morphological identifications. For the molecular identification with the newly designed dinoflagellate-specific primers (18 S 634 F- 18 S 634 R), the success ratio was as high as 86. 7 % for single dinocysts across multiple taxa when using the optimized <b>ultrasonic</b> wave-based <b>cleaning</b> method, and much higher than that (16. 7 %) based on traditional micropipette-based cleaning. Discussion The technically simple but robust method improved on in this study is expected to serve as a powerful tool in deep understanding of population dynamics of dinocysts and the causes and consequences of potential negative effects caused by dinocysts...|$|R

40|$|Ultrasonically-assisted {{cathodic}} stripping voltammetry at a boron-doped diamond electrode, {{has been}} developed {{for the detection of}} lead. At concentrations above 3 μM, linear sweep voltammetry was used to give the analytical signal from a cathodic strip of electrodeposited PbO 2; linearity was observed from 3 - 100 μM, with 3 μM being the lower detection limit. Square-wave voltammetry was then employed for the cathodic stripping step, to lower the detection limits of the technique while retaining linearity to the order of 10 - 8 M. The procedure involves <b>ultrasonic</b> electrode <b>cleaning,</b> cathodic preconditioning and sono-anodic deposition of PbO 2.

40|$|An {{investigation}} of surface cleaning using {{a swarm of}} gas bubbles within an acoustically activated stream is presented. Electrolysis of water at Pt microwires (100 µm diameter) to produce both hydrogen and oxygen bubbles is shown to enhance the extent of <b>ultrasonic</b> surface <b>cleaning</b> in a free flowing water stream containing an electrolyte (0. 1 M Na 2 SO 4) and low surfactant concentration (2 mM SDS). The surfactant was employed to allow control of the average size of the bubble population within the swarm.

To optimise the cleaning process both the ultrasonic field and the electrochemical current are pulsed and synchronized but with different duty cycles. Cleaning action is demonstrated on structured surfaces (porcine skin and finger mimics) loaded with fluorescent particles. This action is shown to be significantly enhanced compared to that found with an inherent bubble population produced by the flow and acoustic regime alone under the same conditions. </span...|$|R

40|$|This master’s thesis can be {{characterized}} as a research project about nuclear engineering. The object of this thesis is the primary system of Vandellós II nuclear power plant. Specifically, it has been focused on the dynamic behavior of corrosion products in the nuclear fuel of a nuclear core Vandellós II PWR. The report describes the operation of the Reactor Coolant System (RCS), highlighting and making a detailed study of an existing and common problem in different nuclear plants around the world, the so-called Axial Offset Anomaly (AOA). The occurrence of PWR Axial Offset Anomaly (AOA) is a limiting operational condition preventing many PWRs from operating with efficient core designs. AOA occurs when boron incorporates in corrosion products deposited in the steaming regions of high-duty fuel assemblies causing the reactor neutron flux to be skewed. It is for these reasons that in industry placed a high priority on developing a capability to assess fuel behavior and AOA risk for any particular core design. An expectation emerged that this capability would be versatile enough to model any PWR geometry and fuel design and would include the known physical parameters related to AOA. Therefore, the first objective of this project consists to study the consequences that produce this anomaly: The AOA phenomenon is believed to result from three interrelated aspects: 1) Sub cooled boiling on high-duty assemblies cause, 2) enhanced corrosion product deposition on those rods, and as the deposits thicken (CRUD formation), 3) boron is incorporated in those deposits causing a depression in neutron flux. After that, the second objective was to provide the different solutions to prevent mitigate or avoid this phenomenon. Among these solutions, there is the use of Boron-induced Offset Anomaly Risk Assessment Tool or “BOA” code. So, using BOA code methodology an assessment of AOA risk and strategies of Zinc injection (as a proposed solution to this problem) is done and accurate risk assessment tool (AOA risk) for projected cycle core designs of Vandellós II are performed. In this section, the BOA code development incorporated the above processes (1), 2), 3)), first requiring a thermal-hydraulic code input to establish the requisite heat flux and assembly steaming. Then, a system-wide mass balance approach to corrosion product release and deposition was applied. A boiling (porous) deposit model was added to address solute concentration processes as the deposits thicken. Finally, boron deposition processes have been incorporate based on both precipitation and physicsorption phenomena. By this process a Conservative and Best Estimate study are done. In addition, different sensitivity studies to analyze the effect of certain parameters on the behavior of the core in order to assess the AOA and to work with an optimal chemical strategy. On the other hand, an important aspect to reduce AOA risk is the <b>ultrasonic</b> fuel <b>cleaning</b> equipment. So, the third objective is the investigation of the <b>Ultrasonic</b> Fuel <b>Cleaning</b> (UFC) equipment. <b>Ultrasonic</b> Fuel <b>Cleaning</b> is a mechanical cleaning process developed by EPRI for reduction of CRUD inventory from irradiated fuel assemblies. UFC reduces susceptibility of PWRs to Axial Offset Anomaly or CRUD Induced Power Shift (AOA/CIPS), and is expected to become increasingly important in CRUD inventory reduction for CRUD-induced fuel failure mitigation, and radioactive material source term reduction initiatives. However, in order to take proper credit for UFC application when using core design tools such as BOA, a quantitative measure of CRUD removal is required. It {{is for this reason that}} the last objective is to propose a new method for quantifying UFC crud removal, and therefore, the effective of the UFC equipment.
