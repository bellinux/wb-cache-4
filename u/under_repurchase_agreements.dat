3000|$|The last {{column of}} Table 5 {{examines}} how bank liquidity responds to exposure {{to real estate}} development. We measure bank liquidity using balance-sheet information on the bank’s lending position in the interbank market and {{with respect to the}} ECB. We compute the value of the liquid assets as the balance of reverse repos held by the bank. Liquid liabilities are defined as the value of assets sold <b>under</b> <b>repurchase</b> <b>agreements.</b> Our measure of liquidity is the difference between both components. The estimates in Table 5, column 5 suggest that the bank’s exposure to real estate development is a weak predictor of the yearly change in our measure of liquidity. 21 [...]...|$|E
40|$|I {{have been}} asked to talk about “Operational and {{technical}} aspects of liquidity management in the post-float era”. That sounds a rather daunting task so I will try to simplify it as much as I can. Even so, I fear some of it may be a little technical to those among us who do not earn their living in the short-term money market. In the interests of brevity, this account assumes some familiarity with the current means of implementing monetary policy in Australia. (For those who do not have it, I have referred to articles dealing with this subject.) For example: • the distinction between debt management and monetary management (as explained in Phillips(2)); • the process whereby government net spending and private sector transactions with the Reserve Bank give rise to a stream of daily injections and withdrawals of cash from the banking system (as explained in RBA(3)); • the means by which the Reserve Bank can buy and sell securities outright and <b>under</b> <b>repurchase</b> <b>agreements</b> in order to influence the availability and cost of cash in the short-term money market (se...|$|E

50|$|Rehypothecation can be {{involved}} in <b>repurchase</b> <b>agreements,</b> commonly called repos. In a two-party <b>repurchase</b> <b>agreement,</b> one party sells to the other a security at a price with a commitment to buy the security back {{at a later date}} for another price. Overnight <b>repurchase</b> <b>agreements,</b> the most commonly used form of this arrangement, comprise a sale which takes place the first day and a repurchase that reverses the transaction the next day. Term <b>repurchase</b> <b>agreements,</b> less commonly used, extend for a fixed period of time that may be as long as three months. Open-ended term <b>repurchase</b> <b>agreements</b> are also possible. A so-called reverse repo is not actually any different to a repo; it merely describes {{the opposite side of the}} transaction. The seller of the security who later repurchases it is entering into a repurchase agreement; the purchaser who later re-sells the security enters into a reverse <b>repurchase</b> <b>agreement.</b> Notwithstanding its nominal form as a sale and subsequent repurchase of a security, the economic effect of a <b>repurchase</b> <b>agreement</b> is that of a secured loan.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a dynamic matching model featuring dealers and short-term investors in an over-the-counter bond market.

The cost also explains {{the existence of a}} margin specific to <b>repurchase</b> <b>agreements</b> held by short-term investors, if <b>repurchase</b> <b>agreements</b> must be renegotiation-proof.
