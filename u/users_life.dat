These products allow the user to be in control of his own life, they are empathic, and they know multiple ways to evoke desirable behaviour. Besides awareness of the user’s current situation, wise products are connected to a knowledge source that helps them decide on the appropriate behaviour, and they possess a repertoire of possible actions that may be customized to momentary demands. The aim is for wise products to contribute to the user’s and society’s subjective well being. We discuss several examples of how people experience wisdom in products and in the way they interact.

Despite therapeutic projects are an essential achievement for the qualification of mental health care, it is still necessary to produce an epistemological rupture in the relationship with mental suffering so that they can achieve the greatest potential for transformation.

The regression analysis of the impact of institutional factors on economic growth in Singapore is made using 17 indicators: civil freedoms, corruption, economic freedom, economic globalization, spending on education, use of energy, share of women at labor market, fiscal freedom, price for fuel, PPP, effectiveness of public administration, level of consumption, Human Development Index, Internet <b>users,</b> <b>life</b> expectancy, unemployment, openness of trade. Economic interpretation of the statistical assessment of economic transformations in Singapore is as follows: quality of the institutional environment (control of corruption, economic freedom, supremacy of law etc.) has critical importance for economic development in Singapore; the increasing spending on education has positive effects for economic growth in Singapore; economic growth in Singapore has high positive correlation with energy consumption...|$|E

40|$|The area {{of mental}} health {{distress}} is one that crosses many disciplines including; psychiatry, critical psychiatry, psychology, critical psychology, history, politics, economics, philosophy, sociology, culture and human geographies (Thrift, 2006). Consequently, there are {{a complex set of}} issues to consider when discussing the experiences of being a mental health service user. Notwithstanding this diversity, such representations {{of mental health}} have a tendency to position service users as a fairly homogenous and static group of bodies – in other words, they are the stable ‘other’ (Conradson, 2005; Parr, 2000). As a way of exploring the complexity, this thesis sets out to explore the multiplex constituents and heterogeneous ways in which daily service <b>user</b> <b>life</b> is played out within everyday mental health spatial contexts. These spaces incorporate the psychiatric institution, the mental health day centre and the home. Using interviews, ethnography, poetry and visual ethnographies, service users’ experiences are analysed by exploring the relational aspects of the discursive and the non-discursive, such as receiving a diagnostic label and subsequent treatments {{and the ways in which}} these practices permeate the embodied and spatial experiences of every day service <b>user</b> <b>life.</b> This corpus of research data suggests that rather than the experiences of mental health distress operating as a stratified set of factors awaiting analysis, there were divergent accounts incorporating positivity, negativity and ambivalence in the ways which service users made meanings of their daily lives (Brown & Tucker, 2010). Consequently, this thesis is framed around the ontological realms of creativity, potentiality and of becoming within and through space (Deleuze & Guattari, 2004; Massumi, 2002). Finally, some implications of the current political changes and how these may impact upon daily service <b>user</b> <b>life</b> are discussed to highlight that mental health service users’ are always on the move. ...|$|R

30|$|However, BigData {{systems do}} not show {{the same level of}} {{excellence}} with data protection features (Colombo and Ferrari 2015 b). For instance, while a variety of data protection frameworks have been proposed for traditional systems (see e.g., Agrawal et al. (2002); Byun and Li (2008); Colombo and Ferrari (2014 a; 2014 b; 2015 a); Ferrari (2010)), the majority of Big Data platforms integrate quite basic access control enforcement mechanisms (Colombo and Ferrari 2015 b). As a result, the unconstrained access to high volume of data from multiple data sources, the sensitive and private contents of some data resources, and the advanced analysis and prediction capabilities of Big Data analytic platforms, might represent a serious threat. For instance, the analysis capabilities can be exploited to derive correlations between sensitive and personal data. As an example, let us consider the domain of fitness apps which nowadays are more and more deployed on mobile and wearable devices and gym equipment. The joint analysis of movement data, hearth beats, and weight might allow profiling <b>users</b> <b>life</b> style and inferring users inclination to pathologies. As a consequence, although the potential benefits of Big Data analytics are indisputable, the lack of standard data protection tools open these services to potential attackers.|$|E

40|$|In the {{literature}} many definitions of megacities and mega-regions are proposed (Urena et al., 2009; Pagliara et al., 2011). For example, Hall (2009) defines a mega city {{region as a}} ?series of cities physically separated but functionally networked clustered around one or more larger central cities and are connected with dense flows of people and information using important transport infrastructures?. Transport infrastructures and services are fundamental either for the emergence or the proper functioning of mega cities and regions. High Speed Rail systems are definitely today considered as important infrastructures. By impacting strongly on accessibility patterns, they have revolutionized <b>users?</b> <b>life</b> style together with their mobility behavior thanks to their power of shrinking spaces and shaping places. This contribution {{is based on the}} recognition that commuting flows are not enough to justify the formation of a megacity or a mega-region. Even if they can contribute to it, they don?t justify the development of a megapolis. A theoretical model should be specified in order to explain the mechanisms through which metro areas integrate into mega-regions and to understand what is the real role of HSR systems as a variable of this model. This paper attempts to fill this gap, present in {{the literature}}, and identify some European corridors having high potential for mega-region formation as supported by High Speed Rail. Examples can be found in France, in Spain and in Italy as well. To achieve this objective, this paper will rely on a thorough literature review aimed at the identification of the possible causal relations between changes in accessibility induced by HSR and the emergence of megacities and megaregions. Moreover a first attempt of specifying the model is proposed. Indeed regression models are defined, where the dependent variables are described in terms of commuting flows, travel time and travel cost of the competing transport modes between metro areas, variables connected with HSR, i. e. comfort, speed, low environmental impact, etc. will be considered as well. Other factors influencing the formation of megacities and megaregions will be introduced and tested. Among them economic variables like the number of jobs, the GDP, etc. Further perspectives should consider that this construct should be tested and synthesized in mathematical terms and then calibrated with the collection of real data...|$|E
40|$|In the {{following}} project, will we examine drug consumption rooms in Copenhagen, and especially about the policy-process behind {{the decision about}} making permanent drug consumption rooms, and the urban space around these two rooms at Vesterbro (april 2014). That {{is why we are}} using the theory about empowerment, to analyze the urban space around the two drug consumption rooms, and to analyze the drug users as a socially vulnerable group. We are using theory about policy-process to look at the actors, who have had an influence on the policy-process and on the decision, and how they have had an influence. Further on, we will look into which arguments there is against and for drug consumption rooms, and put these up against each other in a discussion. In our analysis, we came to the point, that the drug users and the sale of drugs were centralized around the two rooms, and therefore Vesterbro’s urban space as a whole was improved. Therefore problems like noise were centralized too, so it is only the nearby neighbours who is affected by it. The amount of drug related waste has also decreased in the urban space, and so has criminality, like fx. break-in at cafés. Regarding the policy-process, it is bottom-up influence that is dominating, because it was the citizens of Vesterbro who wished a permanent drug consumption room. Likewise it was these, that established Fixelancen, which was based on volunteers. In 2011 there was a change in government, and it was a wish of the new government, to establish permanent drug consumption rooms, and therefore there were a change of law, so this was a possibility. The drug users has received a quality lift of their everyday life, because they now, can take their drug, behind closed doors, rather than taking their drug in front of the citizens of Vesterbro. This is {{a good thing for the}} drug users and the citizens of Vesterbro, because there is no longer the same amount drug users in the streets taking their drug. Besides, the society has change their view on the the drug users as a social vulnerable group, because they no longer is as big a burden for the urban space. Over all, the drug consumption rooms are a success in many ways, because it is both a quality lift of the drug <b>users</b> <b>life</b> and a relief for the whole area and urban space of Vesterbro. This is not without challenges and sacrifices though, and it is especially the nearby neighbours who is suffering with this centralisation of the issues there is with permanent drug consumptions rooms...|$|E
