North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Norway were seeking to replace their F-104G Starfighter fighter-bombers. In early 1974, they reached {{an agreement with the}} <b>U.S.</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the USAF ordered the LWF winner, they would consider ordering it as well. The USAF also needed to replace its F-105 Thunderchief and F-4 Phantom II fighter-bombers. The U.S. Congress sought greater commonality in fighter procurements by the Air Force and Navy, and in August 1974 redirected Navy funds to a new Navy Air Combat Fighter (NACF) program that would be a navalized fighter-bomber variant of the LWF. The four NATO allies had formed the [...] "Multinational Fighter Program Group" [...] (MFPG) and pressed for a U.S. decision by December 1974; thus the USAF accelerated testing.|$|E
500|$|The {{dead man}} in plate 37, Esto es peor (This is worse), forms a {{mutilated}} {{body of a}} Spanish fighter spiked on a tree, surrounded by the corpses of French soldiers. It is {{based in part on}} the Hellenistic fragment of a male nude, the Belvedere Torso by the Athenian [...] "Apollonios son of Nestor". Goya had earlier made a black wash drawing study of the statue during a visit to Rome. In Esto es peor he subverts the classical motifs used in war art through his addition of a degree of black theatre– the branch piercing the body through the anus, twisted neck and close framing. The man is naked; a daring factor for Spanish art in the 19th century, {{during the time of the}} Spanish Inquisition. Art critic Robert Hughes remarked that the figures in this image [...] "remind <b>us</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> only they had been marble and the work of their destruction had been done by time rather than sabres, neo-classicists like Menges would have been in aesthetic raptures over them." ...|$|E

To do that, of course, we Americans will have to yield up some of our sovereignty. That would be a bitter pill. It would take a lot of courage, a lot of faith in the new order.

2500|$|Three weeks later, on 30 April 1864, {{the measure}} of devotion to the Hauhau {{movement}} displayed itself in the reckless march by 200 warriors on the Sentry Hill redoubt, 9km north-east of New Plymouth, in a one-sided battle that cost the lives of possibly {{a fifth of the}} Māori force. The redoubt had been built in late 1863 by Captain W. B. Messenger and 120 men of the Military Settlers on the crown of a hill that was the site of an ancient pā, and garrisoned by a detachment of 75 men from the 57th Regiment under Captain Shortt, with two Coehorn mortars. The construction of the outpost was regarded by the Atiawa as a challenge, being built close to the Māori position at Manutahi and on their land. In April 1864 a war party was formed of the best fighting men from the west coast iwi that had joined the rapidly spreading Hauhau movement. In a 1920 interview with historian James Cowan, Te Kahu-Pukoro, a fighter {{who took part in the}} attack, explained: [...] "The Pai-marire religion was then new, and we were all completely under its influence and firmly believed in the teaching of Te Ua and his apostles.
