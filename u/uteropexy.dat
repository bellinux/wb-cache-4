40|$|Objective The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the safety and efficacy of a &# 8220;Cravat&# 8217;&# 8217; technique for the management of uterine prolapse in patients who want to preserve uterus, involving suspension of the uterus from the sacral promontory by using polypropylene mesh. Materials and Methods A prospective observational study between January 2011 and September 2013 was conducted. Prior to surgery, prolapse assessment was undertaken with Baden-Walker halfway system to grade the degree of prolapse at all sites. Patients with severe uterine prolapse (stage II-IV) who want to preserve uterus, were operated with Cravat technique. All patients were evaluated at 2 weeks and 6 weeks after surgery and followed for 6 months. Outcomes were evaluated objectively by vaginal examination using Baden-Walker halfway classification, and subjectively classifying patients as &# 8216;very satisfied&# 8217;, &# 8216;satisfied&# 8217; and &# 8216;not satisfied&# 8217; at the 6 th month postoperatively. Results Sacral <b>uteropexy</b> was successfully performed by laparoscopy in 32 / 33 patients (one needed to be converted to laparotomy). Nine patients also had a concurrent procedure as colporaphy anterior, colporaphy posterior or transobturator tape. Postoperative recovery has been uneventful with subjective and objective cure rates were 96. 9 % and 93. 9 %, respectively at six month. One recurrence of total prolapse needed to be reoperated and two patients with sacrouteropexy still remained at stage 2 prolapse. There have been no cases of graft exposure, rejection or infection with a median follow-up of 23. 9 months. Conclusions Laparoscopic sacral <b>uteropexy</b> with &# 8220;Cravat technique&# 8221; was found to be safe and simple procedure...|$|E
