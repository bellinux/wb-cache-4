40|$|Genetic drift is a {{mechanism}} of population divergence {{that is important}} in the evolution of plants and animals, but is thought to be rare in free-living microorganisms because of their typically large population sizes and <b>unrestricted</b> <b>means</b> of dispersal. We used both, phylogenetic and IS element sequence analyses in hyperthermophilic archaea of the genus Pyrococcus to test the hypothesis that genetic drift played and important role in the diversification of these microorganisms. Multilocus sequence typing of a collection of 36 isolates of Pyrococcus, from different hydrothermal systems in the Pacific Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, revealed that Pyrococcus populations from different geographic locations are genetically differentiated. Analysis of insertion sequence (IS) elements in these isolates exposed their presence in all individuals of only one geographically isolated lineage, that of Vulcano Island in the Mediterranean Sea. Detailed sequence analysis of six selected IS elements in the Vulcano population showed that these elements cause deleterious genomic alterations, including inactivation of gene function. The high frequency of IS elements in the sampled population, together with their observed harmful effects in the genome of Pyrococcus, provide molecular evidence that the Vulcano Island population of Pyrococcus is geographically isolated and that those genetic mobile elements have been brought up to high frequency by genetic drift. Thus, genetic drift resulting from physical isolation should be considered as a factor influencing differentiation in prokaryotes...|$|E

Using an <b>unrestricted</b> <b>mean</b> field approach, we map out the instability of the topological band insulator towards magnetically ordered insulators which emerge with increasing Hubbard repulsion. In addition to the topological Néel phase, we recover various chiral noncoplanar magnetic orders previously identified within a strong coupling approach. We compute the band structure of these ordered phases, showing that the triple-Q tetrahedral phase harbors topological Chern bands with large Chern numbers.

The first component is customer survival time (time from subscription to cancellation of the service) {{and the second is}} the customer monthly margin. While the customer monthly margin could be estimated directly from the accounting model, the challenge will be the estimation of time to cancellation. In this study 30000 customers were selected from a well established subscription-based company. The customers were classified (segmented) according to their demographic and usage related characteristics. The stratified Cox model was used to identify the significant variables and to calculate hazard ratios. Both nonparametric and parametric survival analysis techniques were used to estimate the mean survival time. The results showed that gender, age and direct marketing city are significant in predicting the hazard of cancellation of the service. Young customers (age less than 26 years) have significantly shorter mean survival time than other age groups. A large difference between the restricted and <b>unrestricted</b> <b>mean</b> survival time was found; {{this may be due to}} the extreme right censoring of 85 % that exists.

40|$|We propose {{model-free}} {{measures for}} Granger causality in mean between random variables. Unlike the existing measures, ours {{are able to}} detect and quantify nonlinear causal effects. The new measures are based on nonparametric regressions and defined as logarithmic functions of restricted and <b>unrestricted</b> <b>mean</b> square forecast errors. They are easily and consistently estimated by replacing the unknown mean square forecast errors by their nonparametric kernel estimates. We derive the asymptotic normality of nonparametric estimator of causality measures, which we use to build tests for their statistical significance. We establish the validity of smoothed local bootstrap that one can use in finite sample settings to perform statistical tests. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the proposed test has good finite sample size and power properties {{for a variety of}} data-generating processes and different sample sizes. Finally, the empirical importance of measuring nonlinear causality in mean is also illustrated. We quantify the degree of nonlinear predictability of equity risk premium using variance risk premium. Our empirical results show that the variance risk premium is a very good predictor of risk premium at horizons less than six months. We also find that there is a high degree of predictability at horizon one-month which can be attributed to a nonlinear causal effect...|$|R

The central + collisions at 50 MeV/nucleon are calculated by the models with and without shrinking, and it is shown that the inclusion of the wave packet shrinking has a large effect on the multifragmentation in a big expanding system with a moderate expansion velocity.

The bar area will be non-smoking in exempted pubs. Objective: To explore the likely impact of these proposals in UK pubs and bars. Methods: A total of 59 pubs and bars within Greater Manchester in 2001 were chosen. Thirteen were mechanically ventilated, 12 were naturally ventilated and 34 had extractor fans; 23 provided non-smoking areas. We measured time-weighted average concentrations of respirable suspended particles (RSP), solanesol tobacco-specific particles and vapour-phase nicotine (VPN) over a 4 -h sampling period on a Tuesday or Saturday night. Results: Second-hand smoke (SHS) levels in smoking areas were high (mean RSP 114. 5 µg/m³, VPN 88. 2 µg/m³, solanesol 101. 7 µg/m³). There were only small (5 – 13 per cent) reductions in bar areas. Mean levels were lower in non-smoking areas: by 33 per cent for RSPs, 52 per cent for solanesol particles and 69 per cent for VPN. Compared with other settings (homes and other workplaces) with <b>unrestricted</b> smoking, <b>mean</b> SHS levels were high throughout {{all areas of the}} pubs regardless of ventilation strategy.

Discharge of domestic effluents pollute the water streams with potential pathogenic organisms posing a public health threat to farmers and consumers of wastewater-fed foodstuff. We determined the effectiveness of Hanoi's wastewater conveyance system, placing particular emphasis on the quality of wastewater used in agriculture and aquaculture. Between April and June 2014, a total of 216 water samples were obtained from 24 sampling points and the concentrations of total coliforms (TC), Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp. and helminth eggs determined. Despite applied wastewater treatment, agricultural field irrigation water was heavily contaminated with TC (1. 3 × 10 (7) colony forming unit (CFU) / 100 mL), E. coli (1. 1 × 10 (6) CFU/ 100 mL) and Salmonella spp. (108 most probable number (MPN) / 100 mL).

Normally sighted young adults were tested with artificial restriction of acuity in Mild Blur (Snellen 20 / 135) and Severe Blur (Snellen 20 / 900) conditions, and a Narrow Field (8 °) condition. The subjects estimated the dimensions of seven rectangular rooms with and without these visual restrictions. They were also guided along three-segment paths in the rooms. At the end of each path, they were asked to estimate the distance and direction to the starting location. In Experiment 1, the subjects walked along the path.

40|$|The Fréchet mean or {{barycenter}} generalizes {{the idea}} of averaging in spaces where pairwise addition is not well-defined. In general metric spaces, the Fréchet sample mean is not a consistent estimator of the theoretical Fréchet mean. For graph-valued random variables, for instance, the Fréchet sample mean may fail to converge to a unique value. Hence, it becomes necessary to consider the convergence of sequences of sets of graphs. We show that {{a specific type of}} almost sure (a. s.) convergence for the Fréchet sample mean previously introduced by Ziezold (1977) is, in fact, equivalent to the Kuratowski outer limit of a sequence of Fréchet sample means. Equipped with this outer limit, we provide a new proof of the strong consistency of the Fréchet sample mean for graph-valued random variables in separable (pseudo-) metric space.

40|$|It {{has been}} argued that the {{inertial}} forces of traditional societies are being gradually eroded {{under the weight of the}} destabilising forces imbued in nascent globalisation. For the new cosmopolitans of late modernity, this means that forging a sense of self is therefore becoming increasingly a reflexive project. This thesis celebrates reflexivity as an emergent human power. Three dominant modes of human reflexivity have been identified; communicative, autonomous, meta. Fractured reflexivity on the other hand is considered as non-reflexive. Moreover, the contextual discontinuity favoured by late modern societies appears to be selective, conditioning structural circumstances in favour of autonomous reflexivity in mainstream organisations. In the first instance, the findings of this thesis expose the fragility of the internal reliability of the measurement models of the modes of Archer’s internal conversation index (ICONI). Secondly, drawing on the resources of critical realism, this thesis’ further contribution to knowledge is in revealing the positive psychological resources associated with an autonomous reflexivity intervention. By adopting an evidence-based realist review followed in sequence by a large scale survey and structural equation modelling, the findings suggest that autonomous reflexivity potentially holds the key to unlocking the resources that underlie positive psychological capital (PsyCap). In turn, PsyCap seems to operate in the intervening space between internal conversation and action accounting for the positive sense of self associated with autonomous reflexivity. However, autonomous reflexivity does not <b>mean</b> <b>unrestricted</b> homo economicus, rather it means the search for congruence between a particular modus vivendi and a meaningful work context. Thus, this thesis also shows that autonomous reflexivity and the experience of contextual discontinuity at work share in a reciprocal relationship. Such congruency translates into positive organisational outcomes at the individual level albeit with the tendency to be mediated by positive PsyCap...|$|R
