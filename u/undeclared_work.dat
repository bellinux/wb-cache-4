40|$|In Social Network Analysis (SNA), {{a common}} {{approach}} to analyze two-mode network (affiliation matrix) consists on prior converting it into two one-mode adiacency matrices and examining separately each mode. Alternative methods, like factor analysis and related approaches, {{have been proposed}} to simultaneously explore relationships among actors and events. In particular, {{in the case of}} binary data a correspondence analysis can be performed to identify the underlying dimensions of the joint factorial map defined by both actors and events (Faust, 2005). Such an approach assumes actors and events to be interdependent, i. e they are simply associated among them without any direction. However, in many cases the a priori knowledge allows to assume a dependency structure for the data, i. e. the actors depend on the event, or vice versa. In such a case the classical correspondence analysis is misleading. In this contribution, we propose to use Non-Symmetrical Correspondence Analysis (NSCA) to explore the relationship structure in two-mode networks when a dependency structure between two node set can be hypothesized. The NSCA has been introduced to deal with the analytical and graphical analysis of contingency table when rows depend on columns (Lauro, D’Ambra, 1984). In the framework of SNA, the use of NSCA can be a fruitful approach to explore the association pattern in the network dependence structure. Our proposal will be applied within a research in the labour market context in Naples. The analyzed affiliation matrix has professional profiles related to <b>undeclared</b> <b>works</b> of officially unemployed people as nodes, and the professional profiles of their three most important friends as events. The aim is to analyze how the undeclared labour market position of interviewed people yields a sort of social and occupational segregation in the friendship networks...|$|R

By late 2014, the sudden emergence of several episodes of corruption that had taken place over the previous years was compared to the Italian Tangentopoli in the 1990s.

Reporting a 2013 survey of participation in <b>undeclared</b> <b>work</b> involving 27, 563 face-to-face interviews conducted in 28 European Union (EU) member states, the finding is that although the unemployed {{are more likely to}} engage in <b>undeclared</b> <b>work,</b> they undertake only 20 per cent of all <b>undeclared</b> <b>work</b> and receive significantly lower earnings from the undeclared economy than those in declared jobs, meaning that their participation reinforces their marginalized position relative to the employed.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis aimed to present empirical {{evidence for the}} similarities and differences between mass sport providers at the local level in Flanders, i. e. non-profit sport clubs as a prototype of the voluntary or civic sector, fitness and health clubs as a prototype of the for-profit or market sector, and local sport authorities as a prototype of the public or state sector. We have particularly focussed on human resources. These resources {{are one of the most}} important assets of a sport organisation. Moreover, there is a growing debate, among both scholars and policy makers, on the professionalisation of sport organisations and the remuneration of sport volunteers. The second aim of this thesis was to provide a contribution to the further development of scientific knowledge on organisational theory regarding sport providers across the civic, public, and for-profit sectors. Boundaries between these sectors have blurred because of features such policy imperative, the significant growth of the number of for-profit sport providers in the last decades, the commercialisation and professionalisation of the sport sector, etc. As a consequence, interorganisational relationships arise in terms of co-operation, competition, and/or co-operation. Because the primary focus of this doctoral project is at the local level, and the selected sport providers are open systems embedded in a local sport environment, two organisation theoretical frameworks were applied: (i) resource dependence theory (Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978), and (ii) institutional theory (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983). The empirical work in this thesis was based both on quantitative and qualitative data, and quantitiative, qualitative, as well as mixed methods. This thesis consists of nine empirical papers, spread over three sections. With regard to the first objective of this thesis, the results shown that mass sport providers at the local level in Flanders do not only vary in history, objectives, and financial resources, but also show interesting and remarkable differences with regard to their human resources. A gender bias was detected in the workforce of non-profit sport clubs, for-profit fitness and health clubs, and the local sport authorities. In all three the types of sport providers women are likely to hold supportive positions, but for women in leadership positions it is rather lonely at the top. Hence, at present women still face a glass ceiling in sport organisations across the civic, public, and for-profit sectors. This inequality was most salient in leadership positions in non-profit sport clubs. Non-profit sport providers display a strong dependency on volunteer workers. Because of the growing debate on the professionalisation and the remuneration on volunteers, a shadow price of volunteer work was calculated. It was shown that non-profit sport clubs are less cost efficient compared to for-profit fitness and health clubs. However, it was argued that the economic rules of for-profit organisations cannot be transferred blindly to voluntary sport clubs,because positive externalities of volunteer work are neglected. Obviously volunteering fulfils other functions for individuals and society than producing services efficiently and effectively. The results of a study on the remuneration of volunteers, revealed that legal reimbursement schemes for volunteers were found to be used in an improper way. Hence, a respectable number of sport volunteers were found to be undeclared workers, especially people holding sport technical functions. Level of taxes, VAT, social security contributions, and so on, resulting in lower payments in professional work were considered as causes of <b>undeclared</b> volunteer <b>work</b> in non-profit sport clubs. The research objective regarding the interorganisational relationships was analysed in six empirical papers. Public sport providers (i. e., local sport authorities) appeared to be the most co-operative sport provider in Flanders. It was found that local sport authorities are more likely to co-operate with non-profit sport clubs and other public providers, compared to for-profit sport providers. Moreover, they were also more positive regarding their relationships with non-profit sport providers, compared to for-profit providers. Co-operation, however, can be considered as one of the core tasks of local sport authorities. Nevertheless, the results also show ambiguity in the goals of local sport authorities. In recent years their regulatory rol in the local sport landscape was emphasised, although they also tend to act as provider of mass sport. Co-operation between private sport providers, both non-profit and for-profit, merely rest on a voluntary base. Non-profit sport clubs were found to be more likely to have cross-sector co-operation with local sport authorities, but prefered co-operation with other non-profit sport clubs above co-operation with for-profit fitness and health clubs. Apparently, many non-profit and public organisations still experience relationships with the for-profit sector as counter-cultural. However, for-profit organisations were more likely to co-operate with organisations whose main objective is not the maximisation of profit, suggesting complementarity. The results of the papers showed that direct economic incentives from the state (cf., subsidies) were found to have only limited coercive power on sport clubs. Apparently, voluntary sport clubs are likely to meet the demands and expectations of policy makers, despite the limited impact of direct subsidising in the total budgets of the clubs. Nevertheless subsidies are still considered as a policy instrument. Regarding the drivers of interorganisational relationships, problems with regard to infrastructure were found to be an important incentive for the co-operation of non-profit sport clubs, whereas no effect was found for financial resource problems. nrpages: 253 status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, a {{small but}} growing {{tributary}} of thought has begun to re-theorise the gendered nature of <b>undeclared</b> <b>work</b> by transcending the conventional t́hind́epiction of <b>undeclared</b> <b>work</b> as profit-motivated market-like exchange and constructing t́hickerŕepresentations that recognise the presence of multifarious work relations and motives in this sphere. Given the paucity of empirical accounts that have sought to develop a nuanced theorisation of the gender variations in <b>undeclared</b> <b>work</b> based on such thicker readings, the aim {{of this paper is to}} report a study of the gendering of <b>undeclared</b> <b>work</b> in the post-socialist society of Ukraine. Analysing data collected from 600 face-to-face interviews conducted during late 2005 and early 2006 that unravel the work relations and motives involved when men and women engage in <b>undeclared</b> <b>work</b> in Ukraine, the finding is that whilst over two-thirds (68 per cent) of menś <b>undeclared</b> <b>work</b> in this post-socialist society is composed of various types of profit-motivated market-like work, nearly three-quarters (72 per cent) of womenś <b>undeclared</b> <b>work</b> is undertaken for friends, neighbours and kin under work relations more akin to unpaid mutual aid and for rationales other than purely financial gain. The consequent argument is that representing <b>undeclared</b> <b>work</b> in conventional t́hint́erms as profit-motivated market-like endeavour depicts such work more through the lens of menś lived practices rather than womenś experiences. The paper therefore concludes by calling not only for a re-theorisation of <b>undeclared</b> <b>work</b> and its gendered nature in a wider range of societies and regions of the world but also for a critical evaluation of the validity of depicting monetary transactions as always market-like and profit-motivated.

40|$|<b>Undeclared</b> <b>work</b> is {{socially}} accepted and widely practiced in Bulgaria. The undeclared economy {{is estimated at}} roughly a third of GDP.

It involves mostly people who voluntarily exit the declared economy but also those that are excluded. The conventional repressive approach to tackling <b>undeclared</b> <b>work</b> has exhausted its effects in Bulgaria.

40|$|When {{tackling}} the undeclared economy, an emergent literature {{has called for}} the conventional rational economic actor approach (which uses deterrents {{to ensure that the}} costs of <b>undeclared</b> <b>work</b> outweigh the benefits) to be replaced or complemented by a social actor approach which focuses upon improving tax morale.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} critically the “marginalisation” thesis, which holds that marginalised populations disproportionately participate in <b>undeclared</b> <b>work.</b> Until now, the evidence that participation in <b>undeclared</b> <b>work</b> is higher in marginalised areas (e. g. peripheral rural localities) and marginalised socio-economic groups (e. g. the unemployed, immigrant populations and women) has come from mostly small-scale surveys of particular localities and population groups. There have been no extensive quantitative surveys. Here, the intention is to fill this gap. Design/methodology/approach – To do this, we report a 2007 survey of participation in <b>undeclared</b> <b>work</b> involving 26, 659 face-to-face interviews conducted in 27 European Union (EU) member states. Findings – The finding is that the marginalisation thesis is valid when discussing younger people and those living in peripheral rural areas; they are more likely to participate in <b>undeclared</b> <b>work.</b> However, there is no significant association between immigrant populations and participation in <b>undeclared</b> <b>work.</b> Moreover, a reinforcement thesis, which holds that the undeclared economy reinforces the spatial and socio-economic disparities produced by the declared economy, applies when considering those with fewer years in education, women, the unemployed and less affluent European regions; they have lower participation rates than higher educated people, men, the employed and affluent European regions. Research limitations/implications – The outcome is a call for a more nuanced understanding of the marginalisation thesis as valid for some marginalised populations but not others. Whether similar findings prevail at other spatial scales and in other global regions now needs investigating. Practical implications – This survey displays that although it is appropriate to target some marginalised populations when tackling <b>undeclared</b> <b>work,</b> this is not valid for others (e. g. immigrant populations, the unemployed, those living in less affluent EU regions).

40|$|Purpose - France is as a {{model of}} {{best-practice}} in the European Union as regards policy to combat <b>undeclared</b> <b>work.</b> This paper takes the country as a case study with which to evaluate the competing explanations of why people engage in <b>undeclared</b> <b>work</b> which underpin such policy: namely, the dominant rational-economic actor approach and the more recent socialactor approach. Methodology - To evaluate these approaches, the results of 1, 027 interviews undertaken in 2013 with a representative sample of the French population are analysed. Findings - The finding is that higher perceived penalties and risks of detection have no significant impact on the likelihood of conducting <b>undeclared</b> <b>work</b> in France. In contrast, the level of tax morale has a significant impact on engagement in the activity: the higher the tax morale, the lower is the likelihood of participation in the undeclared economy. Higher penalties and risks of detection only decrease the likelihood of participation in <b>undeclared</b> <b>work</b> amongst the small minority of the French population with very low tax morale. Practical Implications - Current policy in France to counter <b>undeclared</b> <b>work</b> is informed principally by the rational economic actor approach based on a highly-developed infrastructure for detection and significant penalties alongside incentives to declare small-scale own-account work. The present analysis suggests that this approach needs to be supplemented with measures to improve citizens’ commitment to compliance by enhancing tax morale. Originality/value - This case study of a country with a well-developed policy framework to combat <b>undeclared</b> <b>work</b> provides evidence to support the social-actor approach to informing policy change...|$|E
40|$|This article aims {{to present}} the {{significance}} and prevalence of the phenomenon of <b>undeclared</b> <b>work.</b> First, we discuss the definitional issues of this phenomenon. Then, we present previous estimates on shadow economy and <b>undeclared</b> <b>work</b> in Poland, based on statistics provided by Central Statistical Office and other research entities. Our analysis covers the years 2000 – 2014. In {{the last part of}} the article, we use data from the Labour Force Survey in Poland to measure the number of unemployed who work informally. We show a decrease in number of this specific type of informal workers. In the next step, we compare our estimates with the total number of informal employees, provided by the Central Statistical Office. On the basis of our comparisons, we argue that the growing prevalence of <b>undeclared</b> <b>work</b> has not resulted from unregistered activities of the unemployed. Therefore, we show that a significant part of informal activity occurs within registered entitles, what may provide an important lead in further studies on <b>undeclared</b> <b>work</b> in Poland.
