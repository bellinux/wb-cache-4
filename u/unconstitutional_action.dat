The process Maududi envisioned—changing {{the hearts and minds}} of individuals from the top of society downward through an educational process or da'wah—was very different than what happened in Iran, or under Zia ul-Haq. [...] Maududi talked of Islam being [...] "a revolutionary ideology and a revolutionary practice which aims at destroying the social order of the world totally and rebuilding it from scratch", but opposed sudden change, violent or <b>unconstitutional</b> <b>action,</b> and was uninterested in grassroots organizing or socio-economic changes.|$|E

50|$|On September 17, 1861, {{the day the}} {{legislature}} reconvened to discuss these later events and Lincoln's possibly <b>unconstitutional</b> <b>actions,</b> twenty-seven state legislators (one-third of the Maryland General Assembly) were arrested and jailed by federal troops, using Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus, and in further defiance of the U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice's ex parte Merryman ruling. Because of this large-scale arrest of state representatives the legislative session was canceled, and no further debate on anti-war measures or secession could take place.|$|R
2500|$|I {{have taken}} up <b>unconstitutional</b> <b>action</b> at this time because of the {{abnormal}} circumstances and because precedent has been given by the British government.

I have squared my conduct with my intellect, and if everyone had done so this war would not have taken place. I act square and clean for my principles. .... No matter what your accusations against me may be, no matter what reservations you keep at the back of your head, my appeal is to the working class. I appeal exclusively to them because they and they only can bring about the time when the whole world will be in one brotherhood, on a sound economic foundation. That, and that alone, can be the means of bringing about a re-organisation of society. That can only be obtained when the people of the world get the world, and retain the world.|$|E
60|$|The resolutions, as I {{understand}} them, are resolvable {{into two}} propositions--first, {{the expression of}} a purpose to sustain the cause of the Union, to secure peace through victory, and to support the administration in every constitutional and lawful measure to suppress the rebellion; and, secondly, a declaration of censure upon the administration for supposed <b>unconstitutional</b> <b>action,</b> such as the making of military arrests. And from the two propositions a third is deduced, which is that the gentlemen composing the meeting are resolved on doing their part to maintain our common government and country, despite the folly or wickedness, as they may conceive, of any administration. This position is eminently patriotic, and as such I thank the meeting, and congratulate the nation for it. My own purpose is the same; so that the meeting and myself have a common object, and can have no difference, except in the choice of means or measures for effecting that object.|$|E
60|$|The {{contention}} that capitalist propaganda is what prevents {{the adoption of}} Communism by wage-earners is only very partially true. Capitalist propaganda has {{never been able to}} prevent the Irish from voting against the English, though it has been applied to this object with great vigour. It has proved itself powerless, over and over again, in opposing nationalist movements which had almost no moneyed support. It has been unable to cope with religious feeling. And those industrial populations which would most obviously benefit by Socialism have, in the main, adopted it, in spite of the opposition of employers. The plain truth is that Socialism does not arouse the same passionate interest in the average citizen as is roused by nationality and used to be roused by religion. It is not unlikely that things may change in this respect: we may be approaching a period of economic civil wars comparable to that of the religious civil wars that followed the Reformation. In such a period, nationalism is submerged by party: British and German Socialists, or British and German capitalists, will feel more kinship with each other than with compatriots of the opposite political camp. But when that day comes, there will be no difficulty, in highly industrial countries, in securing Socialist majorities; if Socialism is not then carried without bloodshed, it will be due to the <b>unconstitutional</b> <b>action</b> of the rich, not to the need of revolutionary violence {{on the part of the}} advocates of the proletariat. Whether such a state of opinion grows up or not depends mainly upon the stubbornness or conciliatoriness of the possessing classes, and, conversely, upon the moderation or violence of those who desire fundamental economic change. The majority which Bolsheviks regard as unattainable is chiefly prevented by the ruthlessness of their own tactics.|$|E

60|$|On {{the issue}} of declaring war, however, public opinion was different. It was President Wilson's summons to the neutrals to follow him in {{breaking}} off diplomatic relations that had given force to the earlier campaign; but on June 5th the American Minister, acting on instructions, presented a Note to the Chinese Government urging that the preservation of national unity {{was more important than}} entry into the war, and suggesting the desirability of preserving peace for the present. What had happened in the meantime was that the war issue, which might never have become acute but for President's Wilson's action, had been used by the Japanese to revive the conflict between North and South, and to instigate the Chinese militarists to <b>unconstitutional</b> <b>action.</b> Sun Yat Sen and most of the Southern politicians were opposed to the declaration of war; Sun's reasons were made known in an open letter to Mr. Lloyd George on March 7th. They were thoroughly sound.[76] The Cabinet, on May 1st, decided in favour of war, but by the Constitution a declaration of war required the consent of Parliament. The militarists attempted to coerce Parliament, which had a majority against war; but as this proved impossible, they brought military force to bear on the President to compel him to dissolve Parliament unconstitutionally. The bulk of the Members of Parliament retired to the South, where they continued to act as a Parliament and to regard themselves as the sole source of constitutional government. After these various illegalities, the military autocrats were still compelled to deal with one of their number, who, in July, effected a five days' restoration of the Manchu Emperor. The President resigned, and was succeeded by a person more agreeable to the militarists, who have henceforth governed in the North, sometimes without a Parliament, sometimes with a subservient unconstitutional Northern Parliament. Then at last they were free to declare war. It was thus that China entered the war for democracy and against militarism.|$|E

5000|$|Early in {{the course}} of the trial, Black Panther Party activist Bobby Seale was denied his {{constitutional}} right to counsel of his choice and was thereafter illegally denied his right to defend himself. Seale requested that the trial be postponed so that his attorney Charles Garry could represent him (as Garry was about to undergo gallbladder surgery). The Judge denied the postponement, and refused to allow Seale to represent himself. Seale vehemently protested the judge's illegal and <b>unconstitutional</b> <b>actions,</b> and arguing that they were not only illegal, but also racist. The judge in turn accused Seale of disrupting the court, and on October 29, Judge Hoffman ordered Bobby Seale to be bound, gagged, and chained to a chair, citing a precedent from the U.S. Supreme Court case Illinois v. Allen. For several days, Seale appeared in court bound and gagged before the jury, struggling to get free and managing to make muffled sounds. Defense attorney Kunstler declared, [...] "This is no longer a court of order, Your Honor, this is a medieval torture chamber." [...] (This was alluded to in Graham Nash's song, [...] "Chicago", which opened with: [...] "So your brother's bound and gagged, and they've chained him to a chair"). Ultimately, Judge Hoffman severed Seale from the case, sentencing him to four years in prison for contempt of court, one of the longest sentences ever handed down for that offense in the U.S. up to that time. Due to the judge's <b>unconstitutional</b> <b>actions,</b> the contempt charges against Seale were soon overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals.|$|R

The Center's brief argued that, like law enforcement agents, prosecutors should receive qualified rather than absolute immunity for <b>unconstitutional</b> <b>actions</b> they take in their investigative capacity. [...] The case was argued on November 4, 2009. During the argument, Justice Sotomayor questioned the Deputy Solicitor General regarding studies that were cited in the Center's brief and that show that, as a matter of routine, prosecutors are not sanctioned for improper conduct.|$|R
5000|$|After Jinnah's death, the {{assembly}} was widely criticized for its incompetence. Addressing {{a rally in}} Lahore on October 14, 1950, Maulana Maududi demanded its dissolution, arguing that the [...] "lampost legislators" [...] were incapable of drawing up an Islamic constitution. Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy said that assembly did not possess any {{of the characteristics of}} a democratic parliament. He argued that the nation would overlook any <b>unconstitutional</b> <b>action</b> on the governor general's part if he exorcised the fascist demon and established representative institutions.|$|E
50|$|The Bourgeois {{ministry}} {{seemed to}} think that popular opinion would enable them to override what they regarded as an <b>unconstitutional</b> <b>action</b> {{on the part of the}} upper house. However, the public was indifferent, and the Senate triumphed. The blow damaged Bourgeois's career as an homme de gouvernement. As Minister of Public Instruction in the Brisson cabinet of 1898, he organized courses for adults in primary education. After the short ministry, he represented his country with dignity and effect at the Hague Peace Convention, and in 1903 was nominated a member of the permanent court of arbitration.|$|E
5000|$|By this statement, James Madison {{asserted}} that the states are [...] "duty bound to interpose" [...] to prevent the harm that would result from a [...] "deliberate, palpable, and dangerous" [...] <b>unconstitutional</b> <b>action</b> by the federal government. Madison did not specify the procedural legal details of how this interposition would be enacted or what result it would have. The Virginia Resolution, unlike the contemporaneous Kentucky Resolutions, did not assert that the states may declare a federal law null and void. The Virginia Resolution thus is sometimes considered to be more tempered than the Kentucky Resolutions, which assert that a state may nullify unconstitutional federal laws.|$|E
500|$|The dissent argued that, for {{a section}} 1983 {{claim to be}} valid, [...] "harm alone is not enough; {{it has to be}} the right kind of harm."

This would obviously violate the Fourth Amendment rights of anyone stopped, but people stuck in traffic who were injured by the collateral damage of <b>unconstitutional</b> <b>actions</b> {{would not be able to}} sue because none of their rights was violated. Similarly, it is not enough for Heffernan to have shown injury but violation of an actual right as well. For the dissent, even if the dismissal was for the wrong reason and harm was suffered, the dismissal cannot infringe upon rights he never exercised.|$|R

If future presidents govern by decree, impeachment {{will be necessary to}} rein in the presidency and support the constitution. With a constitutional presidency, any illegal or <b>unconstitutional</b> <b>actions</b> by a president’s administration must be exposed and punished: [...] "A constitutional Presidency, as the great Presidents had shown, could be very strong Presidency indeed. But what kept a strong President constitutional, in addition to checks and balances incorporated within his own breast, was the vigilance of the nation. Neither impeachment nor repentance would make much difference if the people themselves had come to an unconscious acceptance of the imperial Presidency.

OPON members were accused of involvement in illegal cross-border trafficking even though the goods were seized within the territory of Azerbaijan. Presidential Guard members attacked OPON bases in Agstafa and Gazakh. They were quickly decimated and their commanders captured by OPON forces which were led by regional OPON commander Elchin Amiraslanov.

50|$|This line of {{thinking}} regarding section 133 also appeared in the Supreme Court case MacDonald v. City of Montreal (1986). In MacDonald, Jones v. Attorney General of New Brunswick (1975) was cited as finding that section 133 did not really effectively establish a sophisticated official bilingualism for Canada. While rights to biligualism in legislative bodies might allow for some members {{to understand each other}} if they happened to know the language being used, there was no guarantee for this. Moreover, courts should interpret these rights conservatively since they are a political matter. According to MacDonald, having translators in Parliament is thus not mandatory under section 133, since there is no guarantee everyone will be able to understand an MP when he or she chooses to speak in English or French. These rights are thus negative rights only. An <b>unconstitutional</b> <b>action</b> would be for Parliament or a legislature to force a person to leave for speaking in English or French.|$|E
40|$|ArticleThe {{reaction}} {{of the government in}} Kenya, like many other governments around the world, to terrorist attacks has generally been to strengthen existing laws and enact novel laws, especially those that aid the state’s intelligence-gathering capabilities, along with those that are punitive.

40|$|Defenders of the {{political}} question doctrine sometimes observe {{that the lack of}} a judicial remedy for a constitutional violation does not deprive injured parties of all remedy, because injured parties can pursue a political or an electoral remedy - they can seek relief at the ballot box or in {{the political}} process. This essay criticizes that argument. Political and electoral remedies for constitutional violations are ineffective for important practical and theoretical reasons that grow out of the different structures of the judicial, political, and electoral processes. The judicial process focuses each case on a particular issue; candidates in elections always represent a package of positions on many issues, so that voters do not actually have an opportunity to vote for or against a particular, allegedly <b>unconstitutional</b> <b>action.</b> The judicial process produces reasons for its decisions; the electoral process produces only an inscrutable result, so that even if voters managed to defeat a candidate because of <b>unconstitutional</b> <b>action,</b> no one could really know it. The judicial process operates within a system of precedent; political battles may have to be fought afresh each election cycle. The judicial process is mandatory; legislatures may choose to ignore political agitation. Finally, the judicial process operates according to law; the political and electoral processes are majoritarian and {{are not likely to be}} good vehicles for enforcing constraints on majoritarianism. These differences between the judicial, political, and electoral processes demonstrate the error of arguing that the political and electoral processes provide an adequate substitute for a judicial remedy. They also show that the political insulation of judges, although very important, is only one factor supporting the institution of judicial review. Judicial review also rests on the distinctive features of the judicial process: that it is focused, that it is mandatory, that it articulates norms explicitly, and that it operates within a system of precedent. Defenders {{of the political}} question doctrine must explain not only why we should entrust constitutional questions to officials not insulated from politics, but why we should entrust them to a process lacking these other, vital features of judicial review...|$|E
