25|$|As {{technology}} {{improved and}} operational knowledge grew, Oceaneering upgraded their fleet of JIMs. The magnesium construction {{was replaced with}} glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) and the single joints with segmented ones, each allowing seven degrees of motion, and when added together giving the operator a very great range of motion. In addition, the four-port domed top of the suit {{was replaced by a}} transparent acrylic one that was taken from Wasp, this allowed the operator a much-improved field of vision. Trials were also carried out by the Ministry of Defence on a flying Jim suit powered from the surface through an <b>umbilical</b> <b>cable.</b> This resulted in a hybrid suit with the ability of working on the sea bed as well as mid water.|$|E

40|$|The optical {{properties}} of the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) heavy water Cherenkov neutrino detector are measured in situ using a light diffusing sphere ("laserball"). This diffuser is connected to a pulsed nitrogen/dye laser via specially developed underwater optical fibre <b>umbilical</b> <b>cables.</b> The <b>umbilical</b> <b>cables</b> are designed to have a small bending radius, and can be easily adapted {{for a variety of}} calibration sources in SNO.

50|$|An <b>{{umbilical}}</b> <b>cable</b> or umbilical is a cable and/or hose which supplies required consumables to an apparatus. It {{is named}} by analogy with an umbilical cord.

50|$|Most ROVs {{are linked}} to a host ship by a {{neutrally}} buoyant tether or a load-carrying <b>umbilical</b> <b>cable</b> is used along with a tether management system (TMS). The TMS is either a garage-like device which contains the ROV during lowering through the splash zone or, on larger work-class ROVs, a separate assembly mounted {{on top of the}} ROV. The purpose of the TMS is to lengthen and shorten the tether so the effect of cable drag where there are underwater currents is minimized. The <b>umbilical</b> <b>cable</b> is an armored cable that contains a group of electrical conductors and fiber optics that carry electric power, video, and data signals between the operator and the TMS. Where used, the TMS relays the signals and power for the ROV down the tether cable. Once at the ROV, the power is distributed between the electrical components.|$|E

50|$|This type {{of vehicle}} {{consists}} of a tracked Crawler excavator device, built and configured {{to carry out the}} job required. It is controlled tended from the vessel by an <b>umbilical</b> <b>cable.</b> Operating seabed tractors show great similarity with the operation of Remotely operated underwater vehicles.The control of the seabed tractor will be carried out from its control location, with the operator driving the unit as if they were on board. This can be achieved by using cameraâs attached to the unit. These are also operated from the control location. There are a lot of factors to be taken into account. For example, when laying a cable, the cable itself forms a hazards as it can get caught in the <b>umbilical</b> <b>cable.</b> Seabed tractors are often compared to a remotely operated underwater vehicle, but they usually move somewhat slower, being less agile. They can be used together with a remotely operated underwater vehicle to enhance the overview and to survey the progress and performance.|$|E
