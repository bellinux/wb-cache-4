5|$|In 1979, {{problems}} with the export policy were becoming apparent. The Soviets continued to sell newer aircraft designs to their clients, placing allies of the <b>U.S.</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> disadvantage. Denied by the U.S., countries were turning to other vendors for modern fighters, notably France's Dassault Mirage 2000. Barry N. Blechman, Assistant Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, testified that the US reductions in foreign arms transfers had actually encouraged other nations and increased worldwide arms sales. At the same time, there was considerable pressure to provide a suitable aircraft for Taiwan.|$|E
5|$|In May 1840 {{the coastal}} paddle steamer Unicorn made the company's first voyage to Halifax {{to begin the}} {{supplementary}} service to Montreal. Two months later {{the first of the}} four ocean-going steamers of the Britannia Class, departed Liverpool. By coincidence, the steamer’s departure had patriotic significance {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic: she was named the Britannia, and sailed on 4 July. Even on her maiden voyage, however, her performance indicated that the new era she heralded would be much more beneficial for Britain than the <b>US.</b> <b>At</b> <b>a</b> time when the typical packet ship might take several weeks to cross the Atlantic, the Britannia reached Halifax in 12 days and 10 hours, averaging 8.5 knots (15.7km/h), before proceeding to Boston. Such relatively brisk crossings quickly became the norm for the Cunard Line: during 1840–41, mean Liverpool–Halifax times for the quartet were 13 days 6 hours to Halifax and 11 days 4 hours homeward. Two larger ships were quickly ordered, one to replace the Columbia, which sank at Seal Island, Nova Scotia, in 1843 without loss of life. By 1845, steamship lines led by Cunard carried more saloon passengers than the sailing packets. Three years later, the British Government increased the annual subsidy to £156,000 so that Cunard could double its frequency. Four additional wooden paddlers were ordered and alternate sailings were direct to New York instead of the Halifax–Boston route. The sailing packet lines were now reduced to the immigrant trade.|$|E

They continued talking to Albert until the young man said he was a fan of The Vachons causing The Hellraisers to attack him. The Vachons then ran to the ring to chase off The Hellraisers setting up two singles matches between the four wrestlers later that night. The match series ended in a tie with Hellraiser Misery defeating Damien Vachon in a Tables match and Pierre Vachon winning a Thumbtacks match against Hellraiser Pain.

It would take almost a decade of epidemiological studies to conclusively establish {{an increased risk of}} venous thrombosis in oral contraceptive users and an increased risk of stroke and myocardial infarction in oral contraceptive users who smoke or have high blood pressure or other cardiovascular or cerebrovascular risk factors. These risks of oral contraceptives were dramatized in the 1969 book The Doctors' Case Against the Pill by feminist journalist Barbara Seaman who helped arrange the 1970 Nelson Pill Hearings called by Senator Gaylord Nelson. The hearings were conducted by senators who were all men and the witnesses {{in the first round of}} hearings were all men, leading Alice Wolfson and other feminists to protest the hearings and generate media attention. Their work led to mandating the inclusion of patient package inserts with oral contraceptives to explain their possible side effects and risks to help facilitate informed consent. Today's standard dose oral contraceptives contain an estrogen dose that is one third lower than the first marketed oral contraceptive and contain lower doses of different, more potent progestins in a variety of formulations.|$|E

On June 17, facing Érik Bédard with the bases loaded, Davis hit a ball to left field that hit off the left field foul pole at Tropicana Field. Initially ruled a double, the umpires changed it to a grand slam after a review. The Orioles went on to defeat the Rays 75. After a 4-for-36 slump, Davis was benched on June 23, {{but he had a}} pinch-hit walk off [...] three-run home run against Ronald Belisario, giving the Orioles a 64 victory over the Chicago White Sox.

500|$|Trent's Last Case is an {{adaptation}} of British author E. C. Bentley's 1913 novel of the same name, which had already been adapted for cinema in England in 1920. Hawks considered the novel to be [...] "one of the greatest detective stories of all time" [...] and was eager to make it his first sound film. He cast Raymond Griffith in the lead role of Phillip Trent. Griffith's throat had been damaged by poison gas during World War I and his voice was a hoarse whisper, prompting Hawks to later state, [...] "I thought {{he ought to be}} great in talking pictures because of that voice." [...] However, after shooting only a few scenes, Fox shut Hawks down and ordered him to make a silent film, both because of Griffith's voice and because they only owned the legal rights to make a silent film. The film did have a musical score and synchronized sound effects, but no dialogue. Due to the failing business of silent films, it was never released in the US and only briefly screened in England where film critics hated it. The film was believed lost until the mid-1970s and was screened {{for the first time in}} the <b>US</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> Hawks retrospective in 1974. Hawks was in attendance of the screening and attempted to have the only print of the film destroyed.|$|E

That means that about 1% of shares that change hands daily, or about $1 billion per day, are subject to delivery failures, although the SEC has stated that [...] "fails-to-deliver can occur {{for a number of reasons}} on both long and short sales," [...] and accordingly that they do not necessarily indicate naked short selling.|$|E
