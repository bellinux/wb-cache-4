As such, any closed caption stream must be decoded and included as an image in the video stream(s) prior to transmission over an HDMI cable to be viewed on the DTV. This limits the caption style (even for digital captions) to only that decoded at the source prior to HDMI transmission. This also prevents closed captions when transmission over HDMI is required for <b>upconversion.</b> For example, a DVD player that sends an upscaled 720p/1080i format via HDMI to an HDTV has no way to pass Closed Captioning data so that the HDTV can decode it, {{as there is no}} line 21 VBI in that format.|$|E
25|$|Photon <b>upconversion</b> is {{the process}} of using two {{low-energy}} (e.g., infrared) photons to produce one higher energy photon; downconversion {{is the process}} of using one high energy photon (e.g.,, ultraviolet) to produce two lower energy photons. Either of these techniques could be used to produce higher efficiency solar cells by allowing solar photons to be more efficiently used. The difficulty, however, is that the conversion efficiency of existing phosphors exhibiting up- or down-conversion is low, and is typically narrow band.|$|E

50|$|Photon <b>upconversion</b> (UC) is {{a process}} in which the {{sequential}} absorption of two or more photons leads to the emission of light at shorter wavelength than the excitation wavelength. It is an anti-Stokes type emission. An example is the conversion of infrared light to visible light. Materials by which <b>upconversion</b> can take place often contain ions of d-block or f-block elements. Examples of these ions are Ln3+, Ti2+, Ni2+, Mo3+, Re4+, Os4+, and so on.|$|E
50|$|Thermal <b>upconversion</b> {{is based}} on the {{absorption}} of photons with low energies in the upconverter, which heats up and re-emits photons with higher energies. The <b>upconversion</b> efficiency can be improved by controlling the optical density of states of the absorber and also by tuning the angularly-selective emission characteristics. For example, a planar thermal upconverting platform can have a front surface that absorbs low-energy photons incident within a narrow angular range, and a back surface that efficiently emits only high-energy photons. A hybrid thermophotovoltaic platform exploiting thermal <b>upconversion</b> was theoretically predicted to demonstrate maximum conversion efficiency of 73% under illumination by non-concentrated sunlight. A detailed analysis of non-ideal hybrid platforms that allows for up to 15% of absorption/re-emission losses yielded limiting efficiency value of 45% for Si PV cells.|$|E

They {{are being used to}} upconvert 980 nm infrared light to 600 nm visible light. This technique benefits from a very high upconverting capability. Especially, these materials can be used to capture the infrared region of sunlight to electricity and enhance the efficiency of photovoltaic solar cells.|$|E
50|$|Upconverting {{nanoparticles}} (UCNPs) are nanoscale particles (1-100 nm) that exhibit photon <b>upconversion.</b> In photon <b>upconversion,</b> {{two or more}} incident photons {{of relatively}} low energy are absorbed and converted into one emitted photon with higher energy. Generally, absorption occurs in the infrared, while emission occurs in the visible or ultraviolet regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. UCNPs are usually composed of lanthanide- or actinide-doped transition metals and are of particular interest for their applications in bio-imaging and bio-sensing at the deep tissue level. They also have potential applications in photovoltaics and security, such as infrared detection of hazardous materials.|$|E
50|$|Some AV Receivers {{can convert}} from one video format to another. This is {{commonly}} called <b>upconversion</b> or transcoding. A {{smaller number of}} receivers provide for de-interlacing of video signals.

5000|$|Before 1959, the anti-Stokes {{shift was}} {{believed}} to describe all situations in which emitted photons have higher energies than the corresponding incident photons. An anti-Stokes shift occurs when a thermally excited ground state is electronically excited, leading to a shift {{of only a few}} kBT, where kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is temperature. At room temperature, kBT is 25.7 meV. In 1959, Nicolaas Bloembergen proposed an energy diagram for crystals containing ionic impurities (Figure 1). Bloembergen described the system as having excited-state emissions with energy differences much greater than kBT, in contrast to the anti-Stokes shift. [...] Advances in laser technology in the 1960s allowed the observation of non-linear optical effects such as <b>upconversion.</b> This led to the experimental discovery of photon <b>upconversion</b> in 1966 by François Auzel. Auzel showed that a photon of infrared light could be upconverted into a photon of visible light in ytterbium-erbium and ytterbium-thulium systems. In a transition-metal lattice doped with rare-earth metals, an excited-state charge transfer exists between two excited ions. Auzel observed that this charge transfer allows an emission of photon with much higher energy than the corresponding absorbed photon. Thus, <b>upconversion</b> can occur through a stable and real excited state, supporting Bloembergen's earlier work. This result catapulted <b>upconversion</b> research in lattices doped with rare-earth metals. One of the first examples of efficient lanthanide doping, the Yb/Er-doped fluoride lattice, was achieved in 1972 by Menyuk et al.|$|E

50|$|If {{the target}} is a nuclear isomer storing a {{considerable}} amount of energy then IGE might produce a cascade that contains a transition that emits a photon with more energy than that of the incident photon. This would be the nuclear analog of <b>upconversion</b> in laser physics.|$|E
5000|$|Photon <b>upconversion</b> {{belongs to}} a larger class of {{processes}} by which light incident on a material induces anti-Stokes emission. Multiple quanta of energy such as photons or phonons are absorbed, and a single photon with the summed energy is emitted. It is important to make the distinction between photon <b>upconversion,</b> where real metastable excited states allow for sequential absorption, and other nonlinear processes like second-harmonic generation or two-photon excited fluorescence which involve virtual intermediate states such as the [...] "simultaneous" [...] absorption {{of two or more}} photons. It is also distinct from more weakly anti-Stokes processes like thermoluminescence or anti-Stokes Raman emission, which are due to initial thermal population of low-lying excited states and consequently show emission energies only a few kBT above the excitation. Photon <b>upconversion</b> is distinctly characterized by emission-excitation differences of 10-100 kBT.Photon <b>upconversion</b> relies on metastable states to facilitate sequential energy absorption. Therefore, a necessary condition for upconverting systems is the existence of optically active long-lived excited states. This role is traditionally filled by lanthanide metal ions embedded in an insulating host lattice. Generally in the +3 oxidation state, these ions have 4fn electronic configurations and typically exhibit f-f transitions. These 4f orbitals allow for complex electronic structures and a large number of possible electronic excited states with similar energies. When embedded in bulk crystals or nanostructures, the energies of these excited states will further split under crystal field, generating a series of states with many closely spaced energies (Figure 1). The 4f shell is localized near the core of the ion and is therefore non-bonding, while the 5s and 5p shells provide further shielding from the exterior crystal field. Thus, the coupling of electronic excited states to the surrounding lattice is weak, leading to long excited state lifetimes and sharp optical lineshapes.|$|E

50|$|Femtosecond up-conversion is a pump-probe {{technique}} that uses nonlinear optics {{to combine the}} fluorescence signal and probe signal to create a signal with a new frequency via photon <b>upconversion,</b> which is subsequently detected.

5000|$|Energy Transfer <b>Upconversion</b> or ETU is a {{physical}} principle (most commonly encountered in solid-state laser physics) that involves the excitation of a laser-active ion to a level above that which would be achieved by simple absorption of a pump photon, the required additional energy being transferred from another laser-active ion undergoing nonradiative deexcitation.|$|E
50|$|The <b>upconversion</b> {{process is}} said to be {{cooperative}} when there is one or more elementary steps (sensitization or luminescence) in the process which involve multiple lanthanide ions. In cooperative sensitization process, two ions in their excited state simultaneously decay to their ground states, generating a higher energy photon. Similarly, in cooperative luminescence, two excited state ions transfer their energy to a neighboring ion in one elementary step.Energy migration-mediated <b>upconversion</b> (EMU) involves four types of luminescent ion centers with different roles. They are located in separate layers of a core-shell structure of the nanomaterial to inhibit relaxation processes between ions. In this case, low-energy photons are excited in an ETU process that populates an excited state of another ion. Energy from this state can transfer to an adjacent ion through a core-shell interface and is then emitted.|$|E
5000|$|Efficiency of UCNPs doped {{with only}} {{activators}} is usually low, {{due to their}} low absorption cross section and necessary low concentration. Sensitizer ions are doped into the host lattice along with the activator ions in UCNPs to facilitate Electron Transfer <b>Upconversion.</b> The most commonly used sensitizer ion is trivalent Yb3+. This ion provides a much larger absorption cross-section for incoming near-IR radiation, while only displaying a single excited 4f state. And since the energy gap between the ground level and this excited state matches well with the [...] "ladder" [...] gaps in the common activator ions, resonant energy transfers between the two dopant types. [...] Typical UCNPs are doped with approximately 20 mol% sensitizer ions and less than 2 mol% activator ions. These concentrations allow adequate distance between activators, avoiding cross-relaxation, and still absorb enough excitation radiation through the sensitizers to be efficient.  Currently, other types of sensitizers are being developed to increase the spectral range available for <b>upconversion,</b> such as semi-conductor nanocrystal-organic ligand hybrids.|$|E
50|$|As {{discussed}} above, photons {{with energy}} below the bandgap are wasted in ordinary single-junction solar cells. One {{way to reduce}} this waste is to use photon <b>upconversion,</b> i.e. incorporating into the module a molecule or material that can absorb two or more below-bandgap photons and then emit one above-bandgap photon. Another possibility is to use two-photon absorption, but this can only work at extremely high light concentration.|$|E
