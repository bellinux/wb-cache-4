5|$|In {{regards to}} the 6 Plus, Engadget panned its design for being <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>to</b> hold and harder to grip in {{comparison}} to other devices such as the Galaxy Note 3 and LG G3, but praised its inclusion of optical image stabilization and slightly better battery life than the 6.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the props}} in The Wrath of Khan had been reused from The Motion Picture, or scrounged from other productions, but for The Search for Spock Winter wanted to design uniquely Star Trek items. George and artist Phil Norwood collaborated {{on many of}} the prop designs, {{creating}} updated and sleeker versions of the original television series communicators and phasers. Many props were created out of wood and embellished with small pieces from model kits. While the Federation tricorder was created using a model race car body, the Klingon props were intended to look dirtier, with sharp surfaces that looked <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>to</b> carry. George was insistent on using the shapes and materials, rather than blinking lights, to suggest the props were real and manufactured.|$|E
5|$|The two-player {{game has}} the players {{engaged in a}} dogfight between two spaceships set against the {{backdrop}} of a randomly generated background starfield. The game was developed to meet three precepts: to use as much of the computer's resources as possible, to be consistently interesting and therefore have every run be different, and to be entertaining and therefore a game. The game was a multiplayer game because the computer had no resources left over to handle controlling the other ship. After the game's initial development, members of the TMRC worked to improve the game, adding an accurate starfield and a gravitational body, and spread it to the couple dozen other institutions with a PDP-1, a process which continued over the next few years. As the computer was <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>to</b> use for extended periods of time, Kotok and Saunders created a detached control device, essentially an early gamepad. Spacewar was reportedly used as a smoke test by DEC technicians on new PDP-1 systems before shipping, since it was the only available program that exercised every aspect of the hardware. Although the game was widespread for the era, it was still very limited in its direct reach: the PDP-1 was priced at US$120,000 and only 55 were ever sold, many without a monitor, which prohibited Spacewar or any game of the time from reaching beyond a narrow, academic audience. Russell has been quoted as saying that the aspect of the game that he was most pleased with was the number of other programmers it inspired to write their own games.|$|E

The movie was unsuccessful and was quickly suspended from its run in cinemas, although reviewers claimed that the truth was <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>to</b> some viewers.|$|E
25|$|For this film, Magneto's {{costume and}} helmet were {{slightly}} redesigned for better performance due to McKellen's {{experience with the}} previous film in which found the helmet particularly <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>to</b> wear and the costume rather restricting to his movements.

25|$|Soldiers have {{expressed}} concern about the Velcro on the ACU. Dirt and mud can clog the hooks and loops or they can wear out with use, requiring the use of cleaning brushes for clearing the Velcro as part of daily maintenance. Zippers have also been a topic of concern. Soldiers also expressed concern because the zippers (as with any zipper) can bind up, and render the uniform <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>to</b> wear, especially with body armor.|$|E
25|$|Because it {{requires}} breaking the skin barrier, tattooing carries health risks including infection and allergic reactions. Tattooing can be <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>to</b> excruciating {{depending on the}} area and can result in the person fainting. Modern tattooists reduce risks by following universal precautions working with single-use items and sterilizing their equipment after each use. Many jurisdictions require that tattooists have blood-borne pathogen training such as that provided through the Red Cross and OSHA. As of 2009 (in the United States) {{there have been no}} reported cases of HIV contracted from tattoos.|$|E
25|$|HAE {{may also}} cause {{swelling}} {{in a variety}} of other locations, most commonly the limbs, genitals, neck, throat and face. The pain associated with these swellings varies from mildly <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>to</b> agonizing pain, depending on its location and severity. Predicting where and when the next episode of edema will occur is impossible. Most patients have an average of one episode per month, but there are also patients who have weekly episodes or only one or two episodes per year. The triggers can vary and include infections, minor injuries, mechanical irritation, operations or stress. In most cases, edema develops over a period of 12–36 hours and then subsides within 2–5 days.|$|E

25|$|I {{was getting}} so heavy that even my vocalizing was getting heavy. I was tiring myself, I was perspiring too much, and I was really working too hard. And I wasn't really well, as in health; I couldn't move freely. And then I {{was tired of}} playing a game, for {{instance}} playing this beautiful young woman, and I was heavy and <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>to</b> move around. In any case, it was uncomfortable and I didn't like it. So I felt now if I'm going to do things right—I've studied all my life to put things right musically, so why don't I diet and put myself into a certain condition where I'm presentable.|$|E
25|$|For {{small bowel}} examinations, in {{addition}} to fasting for 8 hours prior to examination, a laxative may also be necessary for bowel preparation and cleansing. Enteroclysis involves the continued infusion of 500 to 1000mL of thin barium sulfate suspension into the intestine through a duodenal tube. Then methylcellulose is instilled through the tube. Barium and methylcellulose fill the intestinal loops which can be viewed continuously using fluoroscopy, or viewed as standard radiographs taken at frequent intervals. The technique is a double-contrast procedure that allows detailed imaging of the entire small intestine. However, the procedure may take 6 hours or longer to complete and is quite <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>to</b> undergo.|$|E
25|$|Pit latrines {{may or may}} not be {{an enjoyable}} {{experience}} to use. Problems may occur when the pit latrine is shared by too many people, is not cleaned daily and not emptied when the pit is full. In such cases, flies and odour can be a massive nuisance. Also, pit latrines are usually dark places which are difficult to keep clean. Often, handwashing facilities are missing. For these reasons, shared pit latrines can be quite <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>to</b> use in developing countries. Also, there might be cultural preferences for open defecation and these may be difficult to overcome with unattractive toilet designs. This is currently being discussed amongst experts for the example in the case of rural India where behavior change campaigns are needed to reduce open defecation.|$|E

25|$|During {{the first}} half of the Victorian era, there was a more or less {{negative}} view of women's styles of the 1795–1820 period. Some people would have felt slightly <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>to</b> be reminded that their mothers or grandmothers had once promenaded about in such styles (which could be considered indecent according to Victorian norms), and many would have found it somewhat difficult to really empathize with (or take seriously) the struggles of a heroine of art or literature if they were being constantly reminded that she was wearing such clothes. For such reasons, some Victorian history paintings of the Napoleonic wars intentionally avoided depicting accurate women's styles (see example below), Thackeray's illustrations to his book Vanity Fair depicted the women of the 1810s wearing 1840s fashions, and in Charlotte Brontë's 1849 novel Shirley (set in 1811–1812) neo-Grecian fashions are anachronistically relocated to an earlier generation.|$|E
25|$|In part writing, {{the usage}} of Conjunct Melodic Motion is important, in which the parts {{generally}} move in stepwise motion, and in counterpoint, {{if there is a}} leap (a jump of a fourth or above), the part will progress the opposite direction it just leapt in stepwise motion. Parts also must progress together in contrary motion, meaning the parts are going in different directions. This is preferable to parallel motion, where the parts move together, or oblique motion, where one part doesn’t move and another does. Parallel motion can be used, {{but it is important to}} pay attention to intervals in order to avoid breaking counterpoint rules. Dissonant intervals, both melodic and harmonic intervals are not preferable in most cases. This includes augmented or diminished intervals, tritones, and seventh chords, simply because they sound very jarring in a piece that is meant to sound pleasant to the ear. Parallel intervals, which occur when two parts move the same distance creating the same interval twice in a row, are also important to be aware of. However, this is only a problem when the intervals are either a perfect fifth or a perfect octave. These also can sound <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>to</b> the ear as they tend to have an open or hollow sound.|$|E
25|$|Steady-state {{visually}} evoked potentials (SSVEPs) use potentials {{generated by}} exciting the retina, using visual stimuli modulated at certain frequencies. SSVEP's stimuli are often formed from alternating checkerboard patterns {{and at times}} simply use flashing images. The frequency of the phase reversal of the stimulus used can be clearly distinguished in the spectrum of an EEG; this makes detection of SSVEP stimuli relatively easy. SSVEP {{has proved to be}} successful within many BCI systems. This is due to several factors, the signal elicited is measurable in as large a population as the transient VEP and blink movement and electrocardiographic artefacts do not affect the frequencies monitored. In addition, the SSVEP signal is exceptionally robust; the topographic organization of the primary visual cortex is such that a broader area obtains afferents from the central or fovial region of the visual field. SSVEP does have several problems however. As SSVEPs use flashing stimuli to infer a user's intent, the user must gaze at one of the flashing or iterating symbols in order to interact with the system. It is, therefore, likely that the symbols could become irritating and <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>to</b> use during longer play sessions, which can often last more than an hour which may not be an ideal gameplay.|$|E
