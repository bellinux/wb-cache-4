The nanocomposite film was prepared by combining an environmentally friendly process based on UV-curing of water-based acrylic resins and a mild thermal treatment to form nanosilica in situ from alkoxysilane precursors. Coated and <b>uncoated</b> <b>facing</b> bricks were compared by scanning electron microscopy, surface profilometry, water wettability, and capillary rise tests.

Then the downstream side of the core was back filled with water to initiate the phase inversion process and replicate how this procedure may be deployed in a well. Finally, brine was injected at 5  bar again through the core in the direction from the <b>uncoated</b> coal <b>face</b> to the PES-coated face (which represents the well bore wall) and the permeability was recalculated.|$|R
40|$|Three−dimensional (3 D) {{structural}} {{information on}} many length scales is of central importance in biological research. Excellent methods exist to obtain structures of molecules at atomic, organelles at electron microscopic, and tissue at light−microscopic resolution. A gap exists, however, when 3 D tissue structure {{needs to be}} reconstructed over hundreds of micrometers with a resolution sufficient to follow the thinnest cellular processes and to identify small organelles such as synaptic vesicles. Such 3 D data are, however, essential to understand cellular networks that, particularly in the nervous system, need to be completely reconstructed throughout a substantial spatial volume. Here we demonstrate that datasets meeting these requirements {{can be obtained by}} automated block−face imaging combined with serial sectioning inside the chamber of a scanning electron microscope. Backscattering contrast is used to visualize the heavy−metal staining of tissue prepared using techniques that are routine for transmission electron microscopy. Low−vacuum (20 − 60 Pa H 2 O) conditions prevent charging of the <b>uncoated</b> block <b>face.</b> The resolution is sufficient to trace even the thinnest axons and to identify synapses. Stacks of several hundred sections, 50 − 70 nm thick, have been obtained at a lateral position jitter of typically under 10 nm.

The maximum power output for AR/HR coated 3 -mm-long devices, measured in very short pulsed conditions (100 ns/ 1 kHz), from 10 -m-wide stripes was {{as high as}} 6. 4 W before catastrophical optical degradation.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} work is to investigate and understand the wear mechanisms that determine tool life for PVD-coated and <b>uncoated</b> tools in <b>face</b> milling of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V over a relevant range of cutting data in cryogenic (CO 2) and wet conditions. The interaction between the PVD coating, the coolant nature and the cutting data is also studied. The results reveal that the main wear mechanism which determines the tool life in wet conditions, for both PVD-coated and uncoated tools, is chipping/partial destruction of the cutting edge over {{the whole range of}} cutting data. This mechanism is based on the lateral propagation of comb cracks, resulting in partial removal of the cutting edge. In the case of cryogenic cooling (liquid carbon dioxide), any lateral crack propagation, and therefore chipping, is greatly delayed, resulting in longer tool life compared to emulsion cooling with the appropriate cutting data. Accordingly, abrasive wear (flank wear) is not the determining wear mechanism for tool life with either uncoated or PVD-coated tools. Moreover, the PVD coating does not contribute to tool life in milling of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V, irrespective of the coolant nature. The SEM analysis also shows that cryogenic cooling reduces or prevents flaking tendency of the coating. The results clearly indicate that increased cutting data decreases or eliminates the difference between cryogenic cooling and conventional emulsion in terms of tool life. However, the cryogenic coolant (CO 2) can provide up to 6 times longer tool life compared to emulsion using the right combination of cutting data. In order {{to take full advantage of}} the potential of cryogenic cooling to improve productivity, it is essential to find the optimal range of cutting data...|$|R
40|$|Aero-gas {{turbine engines}} {{have to meet}} reliability, {{durability}} and fuel e ciency requirements. High turbine inlet temperatures may contribute to minimise fuel consumption and, in turn, environmental impact of the engine. Over the past few years, new designs and engine optimisation have allowed increase of such temperatures {{at a rate of}} 15 C per year, with maximum operating temperatures currently exceeding 1650 C. Ceramic coatings (also known as Thermal Barrier Coatings or TBCs) in conjunction with advanced cooling technologies are adopted to protect stator vanes and high pressure turbine blades from excessive thermal loads. Nevertheless, even with these protections in place, such components may experience a continuous service temperature of 1050 C, and peak temperatures as high as 1200 C. Therefore, it is vital that engine rotating components are able to maintain their mechanical properties at high temperature, while being able to withstand thermal loads and having su cient oxidation resistance to preserve the integrity of the ceramic coating, and eventually reaching desired component lives. Such strict requirements can be met with the use of complex Thermal Barrier Coat- ing systems or TBC systems; these consist of a nickel-based superalloy component which is rst coated with an environmental resistant layer (identi ed as bond coat) and then with a ceramic coating. As its name suggests, the bond coat must not only protect the metallic substrate against oxidation and/or corrosion but must also provide su - cient bonding of the ceramic top layer to the metallic substrate. This goal is achieved through the formation of a further layer between the bond coat and the ceramic. In gas turbine applications, such a layer (identi ed as Thermally Grown Oxide or TGO) is an alumina scale which {{is the result of the}} bond coat oxidation during the ceramic deposition. During engine service, several time and cycle related phenomena occur within the TBC system which eventually lead the system to failure by spallation of the top coat.

This may have catastrophic consequences as the <b>uncoated</b> component would <b>face</b> temperatures higher than the melting point of the constituent metal. This is avoided by strict maintenance regimes based on the minimum expected life of the coating. While essential for safeguarding the aircraft, this approach prevents the TBC systems from being used to their full potential. This study investigates possible optimisation methods of the manufacturing process of TBC systems, with the aim of improving reproducibility in terms of time to failure, thereby extending their minimum life expectancy and reliability. Two di erent types of TBC systems are studied: a TBC system with a Platinum-di used bond coat and a TBC system with a Platinum-modi ed aluminide bond coat. The work focuses on the e ects due to modi cation of process parameters (varied within industrially accepted range) on the TBC systems lifetime in laboratory scale cyclic oxidation tests. Experimental results show that accurate monitoring of the metal substrate surface nish as well as of the Pt layer morphology and ceramic deposition temperature may result in a dramatic improvement in life expectancy of the system, up to sevenfold when compared to control samples, or threefold if compared to commercial coatings...|$|R
