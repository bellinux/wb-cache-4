5|$|The {{only reason}} the Nazis put on {{prisoner}} broadcasts {{is to get}} people justifiably anxious about relatives reported missing at the front {{to listen to their}} propaganda. Although many of the messages undoubtedly are true, they represent but a small fraction of our prisoners and we have no assurance that many of them are not faked from papers picked up on the battlefield. What concerns some of us is the consequences of listening to Nazi broadcasts <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> a well-trained listener (and often, even if you are). Nazi arguments often sound plausible. A person may listen to them with all the skepticism in the world, knowing that every word is a lie. But if the content is sufficiently sensational (and it often is) the source may be forgotten in time, and out pops the Nazi lie, all unsuspecting.|$|E

500|$|Although Crane {{once wrote}} in a letter, [...] "You can tell nothing... <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> in that {{condition}} yourself," [...] he wrote The Red Badge of Courage without any experience of war. He would, however, later serve as a war correspondent during the Greco-Turkish and Spanish–American Wars. Nevertheless, the realistic portrayal of the battlefield in The Red Badge of Courage has often misled readers into thinking that Crane (despite being born six {{years after the end}} of the Civil War) was himself a veteran. While trying to explain his ability to write about battle realistically, Crane stated: [...] "Of course, I have never been in a battle, but I believe that I got my sense of the rage of conflict on the football field, or else fighting is a hereditary instinct, and I wrote intuitively; for the Cranes were a family of fighters in the old days".|$|E

2500|$|According to Borlaug, [...] "Africa, {{the former}} Soviet republics, and the cerrado {{are the last}} frontiers. After they are in use, the world will have no {{additional}} sizable blocks of arable land left to put into production, <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> willing to level whole forests, which you should not do. So, future food-production increases {{will have to come}} from higher yields. And though I have no doubt yields will keep going up, whether they can go up enough to feed the population monster is another matter. Unless progress with agricultural yields remains very strong, the next century will experience sheer human misery that, on a numerical scale, will exceed the worst of everything that has come before".|$|E

2500|$|LaVeyan Satanism is {{critical}} of Abrahamic sexual mores, considering them narrow, restrictive and hypocritical. Satanists are pluralists, accepting polyamorists, bisexuals, lesbians, gays, BDSM, transgender people, and asexuals. Sex is viewed as an indulgence, but one that should only be freely entered into with consent. The Eleven Satanic Rules of the Earth only give two instructions regarding sex: [...] "Do not make sexual advances <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> given the mating signal" [...] and [...] "Do not harm little children," [...] though the latter is much broader and encompasses physical and other abuse. This has always been consistent part of CoS policy {{since its inception in}} 1966, as Peter H. Gillmore wrote in an essay supporting same-sex marriage: ...|$|E
2500|$|Compute! {{named the}} game to its list of [...] "nine great games for 1989", stating that with [...] "great graphics, a simple-to-learn interface, and almost {{unlimited}} variety, Populous is a must buy for 1989". Orson Scott Card in the magazine criticised the game's user interface, but praised the graphics {{and the ability to}} [...] "create your own worlds ... you control the world of the game, instead of the other way around". STart in 1990 gave [...] "kudos especially to Peter Molyneux, the creative force behind Populous". The magazine called the Atari ST version [...] "a fascinating, fun and challenging game. It's unlike any other computer game I've ever seen, ever. Don't miss it, <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> a dyed-in-the-wool arcade gamer who has no time for strategy".|$|E
2500|$|In his 2015 book, Farage {{reflected}} {{that based on}} his experiences, [...] "the NHS is so over-stretched {{that if you can}} afford private health care, you should take it, particularly for diagnostics and preventative medicine. In the NHS, the system is so battered and poorly run that <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> really lucky, you will fall through the cracks. The NHS is, however, astonishingly good at critical care. But what testicular cancer taught me is that the NHS will probably let you down if you need screening, fast diagnosis and an operation at a time that suits you". He supports reform within the NHS, saying that its resources have become stretched due to increased immigration, and blaming Labour for high costs of new hospitals built through private finance initiatives.|$|E

2500|$|March Fires {{received}} generally positive reviews. Sean Palmer of The Sydney Morning Herald {{gave the}} album a 4-star review, stating that [...] "March Fires is a gem and channels emotion but never {{to the point}} of nausea, leaving you feeling comfortable in the pleasant tones of a band that know what they are doing." [...] He noted the stylistic similarities of the album to the band's previous work and wrote [...] "There is nothing here to shock or bewilder <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> expecting Birds of Tokyo to return to their alt-rock origins with a hardened edge. If that's the case, you will be in for a jolt of disappointment, as beneath Kenny's words there is an astounding sense of positivity - as though one can climb that mountain, fix that bridge or restore faith." [...] Simon Collins of The West Australian gave the album three stars, writing [...] "Synth-laden mid-album tracks [...] "The Others" [...] and [...] "White Leaves" [...] briefly revive listeners, before they are plunged into a downbeat run home to [...] "Hounds"." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{allergic}} to the pollen of certain trees and herbs (such as birch, horse chestnut, alder, lilac, cherry tree, ash tree, rowan tree, lime tree, dandelion), {{the best time}} for travelling to central European Russia is late spring when the temperatures are pleasant and many trees are in bloom, and early and mid autumn when trees change their colour and it is not cold yet. Summer months are also good except for June in cities in central and south Russia when poplar fluff can be a nuisance, but recently the authorities of many Russian cities have taken action against the fluff by cutting and removing poplar trees and the situation has improved dramatically. Late autumn, winter months, and early spring will be enjoyable if you wear appropriate clothes and shoes. If you are interested in winter activities, in central European Russia it usually begins to snow in late autumn and snowpack usually doesn't melt away completely before early April, although spells of warm weather do occur and snow can temporarily melt away in mid-winter. Ski resorts in mountainous areas have snow throughout the winter season. Central European Russia sometimes experiences cold spells in early May when the temperature can go from +15°C/59°F to the freezing point for a few days.|$|E
2500|$|The love {{triangle}} of Sharon, Nick and Phyllis garnered attention {{and was considered}} one of the genre's most titillating storylines. Soap Opera Digest named it the [...] "Best Love Triangle". Jamaica Gleaner was enthralled by the twists and turns of the love triangle and published an interview with Michelle Stafford; the newspaper asked whether Nick would end his ten-year marriage to Sharon and rather enter into an official romance with her pregnant character Phyllis. Stafford replied, [...] "In a perfect world, she'd wish [...] Nick's. But he's married; he's not going to leave Sharon. And she doesn't want him to." [...] The triangle was also a topic of debate during its run. Daniel R. Coleridge of TV Guide labeled the week Phyllis discovered she was expecting as a [...] "can't-miss week" [...] for the popular triangle. Aubrey Hammack, a writer for AuthorsDen, analysed the storyline and published an article on the matter of adultery. He cited the storyline as realistic, [...] "Men are notorious for saying; I can separate my sexual side from my emotions. [...] Well, <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> a person without a conscience, this is impossible. [...] Most men just don’t realize that once you have sex with someone, that the emotions kick in not to mention the feelings of being in love and caring about that someone you are having the affair with. [...] When this happens, things spin wildly out of control." [...] With Phyllis and Nick gaining a fan following, On-Air On-Soaps referred to this as the [...] "Phick vs. Shick" [...] fan-base war.|$|E
