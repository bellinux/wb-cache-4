Over 50 % of the world oil production came from giants by 2005 and more than haft of the worlds <b>ultimate</b> <b>reserves</b> are found in giants. Based on this it is reasonable to assume that the future development of the giant oil fields will have a significant impact on the world oil supply. In order to better understand the giant fields and their future behaviour one must first understand their history. This study has used a comprehensive database on giant oil fields in order to determine their typical parameters, such as the average decline rate and life-times of giants. The evolution of giant oil field behaviour has been investigated to better understand future behaviour. One conclusion is that new technology and production methods have generally lead to high depletion rate and rapid decline. The historical trend points towards high decline rates of fields currently on plateau production. The peak production generally occurs before half the <b>ultimate</b> <b>reserves</b> have been produced in giant oil fields. A strong correlation between depletion-at-peak and average decline rate is also found, verifying that high depletion rate leads to rapid decline.

This is generally believed to be associated with gas adsorption and desorption. This study found that with a decrease in the formation pore pressure, gas transport in a porous matrix is dominated by Knudsen diffusion and surface diffusion, and the adsorption layer thickness decreases correspondingly, which slows the production decline rate. Therefore, the gas transport in nanopores is also the key factor that influences the production performance of shale gas wells. Gas adsorption and desorption on the matrix pore surfaces together with the gas transport mechanism in nanopores determine production behavior and <b>ultimate</b> recoverable <b>reserves</b> of shale gas multi-stage fractured horizontal wells.|$|R

The motivations influencing the assumptions on which managerial judgement is based are analysed.

The theory of earnings management in general and the influence it has on management of insurance companies in their choice of parameters used in actuarial models to determine reserves were examined. Interviews conducted with senior managers of insurance companies provided evidence that managers use reserving to achieve dual but conflicting objectives of making a return for shareholders and solvency, the ability to meet obligations to policyholders.

40|$|When the {{reservoir}} pressure is decreased below dew point {{pressure of the}} gas near the wellbore, gas-condensate wells start to decrease production because condensate is separated from the gas around the wellbore causing a decrease in gas relative permeability. This effect is more dramatic if the permeability of {{the reservoir}} is low. The idea proposed for reducing this problem is to eliminate the irreducible water saturation near the wellbore to leave more space for the gas to flow and therefore increase the productivity of the well. In this research a simulation study was performed to determine the range of permeabilities where the cylinder of condensate will seriously affect the well??s productivity, and the distance the removal of water around the wellbore has to be extended {{in order to have}} acceleration of production and an increase in the final reserves. A compositional-radial reservoir was simulated with one well in the center of 109 grids. Three gas-condensate fluids with different heptanes plus compositions (4, 8 and 11 mole %), and two irreducible water saturations were used. The fitting of the Equation of State (EOS) was performed using the method proposed by Aguilar and McCain. Several simulations were performed with several permeabilities to determine the permeabilities for which the productivity is not affected by the presence of the cylinder of condensate. At constant permeability, various radii of a region of zero initial water saturation around the wellbore were simulated and comparisons of the effects of removal of irreducible water on productivity were made. Reservoirs with permeabilities lower than 100 mD showed a reduction in the <b>ultimate</b> <b>reserves</b> due to the cylinder of condensate. The optimal radius of water removal depends on the fluid composition and the irreducible water saturation of the reservoir.

Examinant les {{conditions}} de ce maintien dans un contexte géopolitique difficile, il montre qu'une des voies à privilégier est d'accroître les efforts de recherches pour réaliser les progrès scientifiques et technologiques qui permettront de satisfaire {{la demande}} en pétrole et en gaz pour le début du 21 ème siècle. L'effort de R & D nécessaire pour disposer des technologies pétrolières et gazières de la prochaine décennie nécessite une recherche faite en commun, car seule une recherche coordonnée évitera une dispersion des efforts français. L'élargissement des réserves économiquement exploitables, la maîtrise du coût de production et la réduction des coûts des chaînes gaz des champs de production aux régions consommatrices, tout en assurant la protection de l'environnement sont les prochains défis à relever. Pour faire face à ces attentes de l'industrie, d'importants efforts de recherche doivent être menés dans les domaines scientifiques correspondants, afin de mieux appréhender les phénomènes et de développer les solutions les plus appropriées. En définitive, les progrès scientifiques et technologiques, nécessaires à l'élargissement des réserves économiques exploitables, à une plus grande accessibilité aux ressources pétrolières et gazières, ainsi qu'à une utilisation mieux ciblée de l'énergie face à la protection de l'environnement, demandent un accroissement sensible des efforts de recherche. Une telle politique ne peut se concevoir sans recourir à un partenariat plus large et sans une incitation et un financement substantiel de la part de la puissance publique, française ou européenne. This article begins by recalling a statement {{made at the}} 15 th World Energy Council (Madrid, September 1992) : during the next 30 years, fossil energy sources {{will continue to be}} the basis for all energy supplies. By looking at the conditions of this assertion within a difficult geopolitical context, it shows that one of the privileged routes is to increase research efforts to make scientific and technological advances that will make it possible to fulfill the demand for oil and gas {{at the start of the}} 21 st century. The R&D effort required to make oil and gas technologies available for the next decade calls for concerted research to be done, for only coordinated research will prevent the dispersal of French efforts (Fig. 6). Increasing economically exploitable reserves, mastering production costs and reducing the costs of gas chainsfrom producing fields to consumer regions, while ensuring environmental production, are the challenges that have to be faced. To cope with these expectations for the industry, great research efforts must be made in the corresponding scientific areas so as to gain a better understanding of phenomena and to develop the most suitable solutions (Fig. 7). The leading R&D axes to be promoted between now and 2000 are then explained. Reducing exploration risks requires, above all, a better petroleum assessment of basins. The progress expected will be based on the scaling up of 2 D basin modeling to 3 D modeling for assessing the <b>ultimate</b> <b>reserves</b> of a basin (Fig. 8 and Plate I). Improving the determining of the geometry of subsurface geologic structures will benefit from progress in structural imaging, whose aim is to obtain an assessment of the position and shape of seismic reflectors. These are geologic concepts (the understanding the geologist has of the architecture of deltaic or alluvial deposits, of different types of reefs, etc.) which, based on geostatistics and expressed by numerical modeling, will make lithological interpolation among wells (Fig. 9 and Plate II), thus leading to the better characterization of reservoirs. In structures where there is already a good understanding of the formations, the progress expected for the years to come, thanks to geophysical techniques, will involve prestack inversion, which will ascertain important characteristics such as the presence of gas or even the distinction of two fluids as well as the obtaining of three-dimensional data. Concerning production from fields, the stakes for R&D are considerable since the problem is now to produce from the great majority of small and structurally complex fields, or even, in some countries, to resume production from fields hampered by a relatively rustic recovery method. Such undertakings are essentially based on a better understanding of reservoir dynamics. On line of reflection that is certainly important for the future will be to analyze behavior laws in complex cases. In this area as well, numerical modeling is what will synthesize all the data (Plate V). After the reservoir has been characterized and the production method decided upon, it is indispensable to ascertain the most effective ways of operating. In this area, the technical mastery sought after aims to reduce the cost-to-quantities produced ratio while ensuring environmental protection, for example such as replacing oil-base driling fluids by nonpolluting fluids. Achieving optimum production at less cost will require better use of the processing capacities already in place. This will be achieved by the development of multiphase production, in particular for marginal or deep offshore fields. Concerning new production systems and within a context in which oil companies are seeking to exploit marginal fields and deep-water discoveries under the best possible economic conditions, the Nomad project (Plate VI) for multiphase evacuation via a light floating support seems to be destined for a great future. To decrease costs, another alternative is to use automated and unmanned installations. Gas transportation often entails the constraint of exorbitant costs, thus compromising the competitivity of gas projects. This is especially the case for the international transport of natural gas in the form of LNG, which will expand in the most competitive markets only if decisive technological progress is achieved so as to bring about a substantial decrease in costs throughout the entire LNG chain. Lastly, the chemical conversion of natural gas into fuels or petrochemical base stocks may be considered as an alternative solution to liquefaction for production from gas fields very far away from the consumer markets. For both economic and environmental reasons, natural gas appears to be the best possible base stock for manufacturing synthetic fuels. All in all, scientific and technological progress required for the increasing of economically exploitable reserves, for gaining greater accessibility to oil and gas resources, and to better target use of energy in the face of environmental production, require an appreciable increase in research efforts. Such a policy is inconcevable without having recourse to more widespread partnership and without incentives and substantial financing by both French and European public authorities...|$|E

Since that time approximately 1100 new field wildcats have been drilled to test Palaeozoic and basal Triassic reservoir targets in a variety of discrete petroleum systems.

The French were equally determined and even senior commanders exposed themselves to the greatest dangers (Davout's horse was shot under him and Gudin was seriously wounded) in order to give heart to the men. French pressure and the fast-spreading fire forced Hessen-Homburg's brigade, which had been drawn up in support of Rohan's division, to evacuate the position and reform on the escarpment behind the village, closely followed by Gudin's skirmishers. Combat did continue around the disused church, where Riese's battered brigade, infantry regiments 44 Bellegarde, 46 Chasteler, 58 Beaulieu, nine battalions in total, was still holding out with remarkable tenacity {{and despite the fact that}} their commander, General-Major Riese, did not bother to show himself throughout the day. The church, with its conspicuous stone tower, was finally lost by the Austrians towards noon, when Friant managed to push through and link up with Gudin and Puthod, forcing the three Austrian regiments to withdraw, in order to avoid being outflanked. When Rosenberg failed to retake the tower with Hessen-Homburg's brigade, he decided to redeploy his entire force further back on the plateau and form a new line. This timely action temporarily stopped any further French advance. Seeing this development, Davout chose to force a decisive breakthrough and committed his <b>ultimate</b> <b>reserve,</b> the 3rd Heavy Cavalry Division.

The division was formed of four cuirassier regiments, the 4th, 6th, 7th and 8th, totaling 16 squadrons and almost 2,000 men. Receiving his orders to charge immediately, Arrighi hastily formed his squadrons and led forward Bordessoule's brigade up the slope, but once there, he found himself in the middle of enemy barricades and was, according to his own account, unable to deploy a single squadron. The steel-clad cuirassiers made several attempts to break the sturdy Austrian masses, but the terrain was not proper for such action and their best attempts came to nothing. Taking some 300 casualties after several frustratingly ineffective charges, Arrighi pulled his men back to safety down the slope and furiously set off to find Davout and protest against the orders he had given.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The crop {{insurance}} {{industry is a}} private-public partnership, whereby the private companies issue policies and handle claims for multi-peril {{crop insurance}} policies, which are administered by the U. S. Department of Agriculture-Risk Management Agency. The private companies are reinsured by the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation {{under the terms of}} the Standard Reinsurance Agreement. Private companies also issue insurance policies not administered by RMA, which provide additional cover, typically referred to as “Crop-Hail. ” Crop insurance is a short-tailed line of business; however, significant variation to the ultimate loss ratio exists on an annual basis. Reserving for crop insurance is unique due to the characteristics of the crop insurance policy and catastrophic nature of the risks: weather and price changes. This catastrophic risk is mitigated due to reinsurance from the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation. This paper presents methodology to estimate <b>ultimate</b> losses and <b>reserves</b> for crop insurance...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of various quantitative techniques and assumptions by different authors to forecast the world’s conventional crude oil {{production in the}} 21 st Century results in highly inconsistent predictions. The forecasts attempt to pin-point the peak world oil production year (Hubbert’s Peak), peak production rate, and post-peak decline rate, based on estimates of the <b>ultimate</b> recoverable <b>reserves</b> (EURR). These techniques, pioneered by M. K. Hubbert in the mid- 1950 s, generally consider economic factors, such {{as the price of}} oil, as irrelevant in the long run. Some authors support a Low EURR World Scenario (about 2. 0 trillion barrels, of which half has already been produced) and forecast Hubbert’s Peak in this decade. Other authors estimate the EURR at about 3. 0 trillion barrels (Median EURR World Scenario), and this estimate is the mean EURR assessment of the United States Geological Survey and similar to assessments by several major oil and gas companies. An EURR of 3. 0 trillion barrels implies Hubbert’s Peak will occur in 2020, or so, at a production rate of about 90 – 100 million barrels/day (compared to 85 million barrels/day in late 2005). A few authors support a High EURR World Scenario (4. 0 trillion barrels or more) with Hubbert’s Peak in 2030 at a rate of 120 million barrels/day. Sensitivity analysis for Hubbert’s Curve suggest that Hubbert’s Peak moves by three years for every 200 billion barrels of error in the EURR...|$|R
