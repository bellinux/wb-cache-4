6000|$|Grant {{turned to}} the prisoner. [...] "There's nothing that would warrant our showing any mercy, {{but if you have}} {{anything}} to urge we'll listen now. It's your <b>last</b> <b>opportunity.</b> You were heading for one of the cattle-men's homesteads?" ...|$|R

60|$|I {{think that}} I cannot employ my <b>last</b> <b>opportunity</b> of {{addressing}} you, officially, more properly--I may say more dutifully--than in revising these old judgments with such help as further knowledge and reflection, and an extreme {{desire to get}} at the truth, may afford me.|$|R
50|$|Between 1960 and 2011, the <b>last</b> <b>opportunity</b> {{prior to}} its 2012 closure, Wedgwood Memorial College offered a week-long Esperanto summer school every August.

5000|$|R.H. Anderson {{failed to}} avail {{himself of the}} most {{significant}} advantage three hours of fighting on Chinn Ridge and Henry Hill had forged.

60|$|I {{lay down}} under the coverlet {{as he had done}} and was soon <b>unconscious.</b> My <b>last</b> {{recollection}} was of that circle of lamplight, and of the small, hunched-up figure and strained, anxious face of Lord Linchmere in the centre of it.|$|R

50|$|Eugenius also {{represented}} the <b>last</b> <b>opportunity</b> for the pagans, with the senatorial class, {{to oppose the}} Christianization of the Empire.

60|$|He {{himself had}} {{said that this was}} the <b>last</b> <b>opportunity,</b> poor though it might prove, to get word to our people, and he must also have {{realized}} all the dangers that would menace us when another day was come and the king's soldiers settled themselves down to the task of holding their enemy in check.|$|R
50|$|Conway saw one <b>last</b> <b>opportunity</b> {{before his}} final debate with Paul.
