50|$|Conventional {{methods for}} {{deleting}} data permanently from a storage device involve overwriting its whole content with zeros, ones or other patters - {{a process which}} can take {{a significant amount of}} time, depending on the capacity and the type of the medium. Cryptography offers a way of making the erasure almost instantaneous, as long as all data on a device is encrypted and the key is stored on the same device. Although this setup on its own does not offer any protection in case an <b>unauthorised</b> <b>person</b> gains physical access to the device, it means that all information on it can be made inaccessible by erasing only the key. An example implementation of this method can be found on iOS devices, where the cryptographic key is kept in a dedicated 'Effaceable Storage'.|$|R

5000|$|In 1922, Harry Reeve {{was forced}} to retire owing to ill health, with reports he had become sick from the [...] "strain caused by war work." [...] He was succeeded by Alfred Beesley, a former Scotland Yard detective. Beesley was hugely unpopular with the Police Watch Committee and his subordinates. He stubbornly refused to wear uniform, whether in the {{execution}} of his duty, at court or at official functions, and was incredibly difficult to get on with. In 1941, Beesley was reported to the Police Watch Committee {{by one of his}} own Sergeants for a number of transgressions in office. In a written statement, the officer accused Beesley of misusing police-owned vehicles, issuing petrol coupons to <b>unauthorised</b> <b>persons,</b> using police-owned fuel for unofficial purposes and for allowing an Inspector to take a vehicle out of the force area when on leave. Lack of evidence meant that no charges or disciplinary action was taken against Beesley, who became infuriated at the claims and started a personal vendetta against his accuser. Beesley reported the officer for misuse of a police car and for making fraudulent entries in a log book, allegations which were not upheld by the Committee. A short time after, the Sergeant reported Beesley for coming into work drunk, an allegation which was again dismissed because it could not be proven. Beesley dismissed the officer, but the Watch Committee intervened and reinstated him.|$|E
5000|$|Gerstungen {{station was}} heavily {{affected}} by the division of Germany between the GDR and the Federal Republic of Germany after 1945. The first affected were the many war refugees and refugees who were transferred to transit camps in Herleshausen and Bebra. Even during the brief US occupation of Thuringia, smuggling flourished. In the 1950s, the bordering places near Eisenach had a favourable location for people assisting escapes from East Germany. Accordingly, railway traffic in the neighbouring towns west of Eisenach was closely watched as a result. Passenger trains to Gerstungen were sealed at Wartha station, {{in order to prevent}} passengers jumping off in the Hessian area around Herleshausen station. Passenger services were terminated at Eisenach in 1952. A bus services was established to Gerstungen as a substitute. The railway served freight transport (especially potash mining) and interzone trains (Interzonenzugen, passenger trains between East and West Germany). The border formalities for the interzone trains on the GDR side had already been carried out at Wartha station. The military trains of the occupying powers travelling to and from West-Berlin passed through the station without controls. On 13 April 1962, a line from Förtha to Gerstungen was inaugurated, which bypassed the West German territory around Herleshausen. The internal traffic from Gerstungen towards Eisenach was resumed. The border controls of the interzone trains were relocated from Wartha to Gerstungen from 28 September 1963, with the trains now using the new line. The old line through Wartha was only used to a limited extent by freight traffic. Between 1963 and 1978, a pair of freight train operated on the old line every day, serving the supply of fuel and industrial goods to the border regions. One of the largest brickworks in Thuringia, which was indispensable for post-war reconstruction, was located in Gerstungen. The Gerstungen border station was considerably rebuilt. In 1966/67, a separate part of the station was set up {{on the north side of}} the station for the processing of Interzone trains. The old part station was redesigned as a terminus and served the passenger trains to Eisenach. Both stations were connected by a 150 metre-long tunnel. There were extensive facilities for freight transport between both parts. A special feature was the potassium trains, which came from Philippsthal and Heringen area in Hesse and, in the absence of a direct link to the rest of the Deutsche Bundesbahn’s network, ran over the Gerstungen-Vacha railway and to Gerstungen in the DDR and reversed in the station before heading back towards Bebra in the Federal Republic. A number of security measures, such as catch points, prevented entry into trains by <b>unauthorised</b> <b>persons</b> or the passage of trains to the Federal Republic without permission from the border authorities. Unlike most other border stations between the GDR and the Federal Republic, there was no interchange between interzone trains and domestic trains; entry and exit was generally not permitted to/from the interzone trains. In older Deutsche Reichsbahn foreign travel guides, this fact was pointed out specifically, but in later years the stop at the station was no longer shown. A miniature replica of the Gerstungen border station by Modelleisenbahnfreunden Bremen e.V. can be visited on the grounds of the Jacobs University in Bremen.|$|E
