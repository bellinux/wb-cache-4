60|$|How, then, {{shall we}} get rid of the foul air {{at the top of the}} room? After all that has been written and tried on ventilation, I know no simpler method than putting into the chimney one of Arnott's {{ventilators}}, which may be bought and fixed for a few shillings; always remembering that it must be fixed into the chimney as near the ceiling as possible. I can speak of these ventilators from twenty-five years' experience. Living in a house with low ceilings, liable to become overcharged with carbonic acid, which produces sleepiness in the evening, I have found that these ventilators keep the air fresh and pure; and I consider the presence of one of these ventilators in a room more valuable than three or four feet additional height of ceiling. I have found, too, that their working proves how necessary they are, from this simple fact:--You would suppose that, as the ventilator opens freely into the chimney, the smoke would be blown down through it in high winds, and blacken the ceiling: but this is just what does not happen. If the ventilator be at all properly poised, so as to shut with a violent gust of wind, it will at all other moments keep itself permanently open; proving thereby that there is an <b>up-draught</b> of heated air continually escaping from the ceiling up the chimney. Another very simple method of ventilation is employed in those excellent cottages which Her Majesty has built for her labourers round Windsor. Over each door a sheet of perforated zinc, some 18 inches square, is fixed; allowing the foul air to escape into the passage; and in the ceiling of the passage a similar sheet of zinc, allowing it to escape into the roof. Fresh air, meanwhile, should be obtained from outside, by piercing the windows, or otherwise. And here let me give one hint to all builders of houses. If possible, let bedroom windows open at the top as well as at the bottom.|$|E

40|$|Being in {{his late}} twenties, the doctor of law Joachim P. Küttner {{systematically}} searched for atmospheric uplift, {{which could be used}} for soaring flight, a sport of growing popularity during the 1930 s in Germany. Within three years he published no less than six papers dealing with convective <b>up-draughts</b> over Northern Finland {{as well as in the}} Balkans, with uplift at the tropopause level during cyclogenesis and with a classification of terms contributing to the quantity of dynamic pressure. However, his broad observational documentation of wave clouds connected with flow across mountain ridges and the experimental description of the vertical motion field during a regional gliding contest at the lee side of the Riesengebirge constituted the landmark paper that made his name known to a wider community. He postulated an intrinsic connection between highly turbulent flow in low levels rotors and often smooth motion in mountain waves aloft. In a companion paper, he also aimed at a theoretical explanation of the available observations. This presentation attempts to recall the essence of Küttner's first surge of publications. In conjunction with a few facts from his family background and his non-standard, highly self-steered academic training in atmospheric physics we arrive at this working hypothesis: "Küttner's early achievements much profited from combining experiences of established law systems and sharp physical observations with the tenacity and perseverance of an active sportsman". It is envisaged that the presentations with foci on later steps in Kuettner's long career can help to corroborate the early findings...|$|R
50|$|It {{incorporates}} the last surviving 'pinnacle kiln' in Bridgwater, which {{dates from the}} 19th century, and has been scheduled as an ancient monument and Grade II* listed building. It {{used to be one}} of six at the former Barham Brothers' Yard at East Quay. The industry declined during the 20th century as the products of the London Brick Company were more uniform than those produced in Bridgwater, and the increasing use of concrete after World War II. The kiln was last fired in 1965, the year that the works closed. The other kiln, built in 1858 by Alfred Barham, was originally used for <b>up-draught</b> firing and converted to the more energy efficient down-draught firing.|$|E
50|$|In 1846 {{business}} partners James Date, William Peach and John Wansbrough bought the business from Wood's estate, and introduced mechanised-production via a water wheel powered pulley system. But from the 1860s, the factory started {{the process of}} converting to steam power. As the installed Lancashire boilers had initial draughting problems being located in a shelter valley, in 1865 a square-shaped chimney was built of local red bricks from Wellington Brickworks. Its four-sections were each marked by a double-course of buff brick from Ebbw Vale, and further bound by iron-bands. Originally 75 ft in height, two further sections were added totalling 15 ft to provide additional <b>up-draught.</b> The chimney survived until 2011, when it {{was replaced by a}} new stainless-steel structure and demolished.|$|E
5000|$|The main fire chamber {{was at the}} bottom, {{but there}} might be {{additional}} [...] "stoke holes" [...] to allow adding extra fuel at intervals up the slope, as well as peep holes to allow sight of the interior. At the far, top, end there was a chimney, but given the <b>up-draught</b> of the slope, this {{did not need to}} be tall, and might be omitted altogether. The size and shape of the kilns and chambers within varied considerably. Firing was begun at the bottom end and moved up the slope. The fuel might be wood or (generally less often) coal, which affected the atmosphere of the firing; wood giving a reducing atmosphere and coal an oxidizing one. The weight of pottery produced was about the same as the weight of wood required. Generally saggars were used, at least in later periods. These were an innovation of Ding ware from the north in the Song dynasty.|$|E

The fireproof mill was designed and built by Sidney Stott. There were 70 fireproof textile mills were constructed in Twente between 1880 and 1914. Sidney the Oldham architect, not to be confursed with his cousins Stott and Sons was a millwright who cooperated with most advanced textile machine manufacturers: the mill was handed over complete with power source, line shafting and all the spinning machines needed to spin cotton. The building was modelled on similar double-mills in Lancashire. A central tower housed the engine and the water tank for the sprinkers, either side were the three storey mills with the large uninterrupted floors needed for mule spinning. The height of the chimney was determined by <b>up-draught</b> needed by the boilers. The factory operated until 1967. It is a Rijksmonument (listed building) The building was refurbished from 1975.

40|$|In 2004 the Department of Chemical and Process Engineering (CAPE) at University of Canterbury began a {{programme}} {{to investigate}} using biomass gasification integrated combined cycle (BIGCC) technology to convert waste products and residues to useful {{energy for the}} wood processing sector. This research was conducted {{as a part of}} Objective Two of the programme to develop gasification and gas cleaning technology. This project involved commissioning and characterising the operation of the Fast Internal Circulating Fluidised Bed (FICFB) gasifier and comparing its operation with a more conventional <b>up-draught</b> process owned and operated by Page Macrae in Mount Manganui. The wood derived gas composition of each gasifier was measured using gas chromatography and these compositions were used to calculate lower heating values (LHV). The CAPE FICFB gasifier has proven to produce successfully a gas with a lower heating value of 10400 - 12500 kJ/Nm³. The Page Macrae gasification process produces a low quality gas with a lower heating value of 4100 - 5100 kJ/Nm³. This is much lower than the CAPE gasifier since the oxidant used in the <b>up-draught</b> gasification process is air and the product gas is diluted by nitrogen. The Page Macrae gasification system combusts wood derived gas to produce steam for a laminar veneer lumber (LVL) processing plant so gas quality and heating value are less important than in electrical production applications. Reducing the nitrogen content of the CAPE product gas will increase the heating value of the gas. Improvements to the boiler system will reduce the amount of air required for gasification and hence reduce the nitrogen content. Further improvements to gas quality can be gained from a change in the fuel feed point from on top of the gasification column's bubbling fluidised bed {{to the side of the}} bubbling fluidised bed. The CAPE gasifier is much more complicated and requires specialised operators but produces a gas suitable for gas engine and gas turbine technology. Overall the CAPE gasification system is more suited to BIGCC applications than the Page Macrae process...|$|E

Permission to make the text available has been requested from the publisher and the full text may be made available once this has been received. Ancient kilns found in Greece are of the <b>up-draught</b> type and occur in two basic forms, circular and rectangular, with various arrangements {{to the structure of}} combustion chambers. Rarely is any direct evidence of the superstructure preserved. This paper examines the technological similarities between these kilns and the practical issues faced by potters in firing them. Potters learnt to control the firing process through a range of practices that leave few or no archaeological traces on the kiln structures. It is argued that differences found in most archaeological remains of kiln structures probably reflect cultural rather than technological distinctions. The transmission of technical knowledge on firing practices is therefore better reflected in the resulting pottery rather than kiln architecture.

The velocity distribution in the porous bed is described by laws of fluid dynamics in porous media. The dominating heat transfer mechanism is convection and two energy equations are required since the porous media region contains both fluid and solid.

Conclusions are that it is possible to simulate convective heat transfer within a porous media in ANSYS CFX 10. 0. There are however some limitations when using the diffusive transport equation as the solid phase energy equation that need further investigation.

40|$|Iron ore pellets are {{a highly}} refined product and for {{companies}} such as LKAB {{it is important to}} constantly improve the pelletization in order to enhance production and improve product quality. A long term goal has been established to develop and considerably refine tools and techniques with which the drying zone of a pelletizing plant can be optimized. The aim with this research project is to numerically investigate how material and processing parameters influence the drying. This will be applied to several scales: i) The constituents of the pellets and their properties and geometry. ii) The geometry of the pellet, their permeability and size distribution. iii) The geometry of the bed and the processing conditions including the state of the air (ex. humidity, temperature and velocity). To start with, a pellet bed model of velocity and temperature distribution in the <b>up-draught</b> drying zone without regard to moisture transport is developed with aid of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Results from simulations show a rapid cooling of air due to the high specific surface area in the porous material. Following this work, heat and mass transport within a single pellet during drying is modeled. Heat transfer and convective transport of water and air through the capillaries of the porous media is computed and vaporization by boiling is taken into account. A sensitivity analysis shows {{that it is important to}} use a realistic value of the convective heat transfer coefficient when the vaporization of water is a dominating drying mechanism while the temperature of the solid and capillary movement of water is not influenced to the same extent. The derived model is applicable to a number of numerical set up such as a single pellet placed in infinite space. To further develop a single pellet model, forced convective heating of a porous media with surrounding flow field taken into account must first be examined. Therefore, a two dimensional model with properties similar to that of an iron ore pellet is numerically investigated. With interface heat transfer condition provided by CFD, the heat transfer and fluid flow around and within a porous cylinder is examined. The results lay foundation of future development of a single pellet drying model where heat and mass transfer models are combined and coupled to the surrounding flow field.

40|$|Iron ore pellets are {{a highly}} refined product {{supplied}} to the steel making industry {{for use in}} blast furnaces or direct reduction processes. The use of pellets offers many advantages such as customer adopted products, transportability and mechanical strength yet the production is time and energy consuming. Being such, {{there is a natural}} driving force to enhance the pelletization in order to optimize production and improve quality. The aim with this thesis is to develop numerical models with which the drying zone of an induration furnace can be examined and optimized. To start with, a continuous model of velocity and temperature distribution in the <b>up-draught</b> drying zone, without regard to moisture transport, is developed with aid of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The results show a rapid cooling of air due to the high specific surface area in the porous material. With the global model an overall understanding of heat transfer is gained, but the heat and moisture transport should also be investigated on a smaller scale in order to account for small scale phenomena such as turbulence and dispersion. Drying of a bed of iron ore pellets is therefore considered by modeling a two-dimensional discrete system of round pellets. The system is divided by modified Voronoi diagrams and the convective heat transfer of hot fluid flow through the system including dispersion due to random configuration of the pellets is modeled. The results show that the temperature front advances much faster in the gaps between pellets than in the interior of the pellets even if all the heat energy of the air goes in heating of the pellets initially. Decrease of temperature is possible for low dew points of the input air due to evaporation. If the dew point temperature is higher than the temperature of the pellets on the other hand, there is slight condensation of the steam {{at the beginning of the}} process and the temperature increases faster than it would for pure thermal heating. An uneven distribution in temperature and moisture content between pellets is furthermore displayed in the discrete system. This phenomenon is related to the natural dispersion occurring in random system of pellets. To further investigate drying of individual pellets, forced convective heating of a cylindrical porous pellet with surrounding flow field taken into account is first examined. A model with properties similar to that of an iron ore pellet is numerically investigated and with interface heat transfer condition provided by CFD, the simulations show an increased heating rate for the porous cylinder when compared to a solid. The most plausible explanation to this is that there is less solid to heat up for the porous medium since the porous cylinder behaves as if it was impermeable from a fluid flow point of view. With diffusive liquid transport inside the two-dimensional pellet and corresponding evaporation at the surface, simulations of drying show an initial warm up phase with a succeeding constant rate drying phase. Constant drying rate will only be achieved if the surface temperature is constant, i. e. if it has reached the wet bulb temperature. The falling rate period will subsequently start at the forward stagnation point when the local moisture content approaches zero, while other parts of the surface still provide enough moisture to allow surface evaporation. The phases will thus coexist for a period of time. Experiments are carried out in order to examine the drying behavior of a single iron ore pellet with main goal to retrieve data for validation of the computational drying models. The experiments are performed with two inlet temperatures and one pellet from the experiments is scanned by an optical scanning equipment. In order to investigate the influence of surface irregularities and overall geometry on drying, simulations of the first drying period are compared for: 1) a scanned pellet 2) an oval pellet resembling the experimental one with equivalent volume 3) a spherical pellet with equivalent volume. The results show that the local moisture content at the surface is influenced by both surface irregularities and overall geometry. A smooth surface will decrease the local variation of moisture while a spherical geometry will, compared to an oval, increase the difference. A diffusive model taking into account capillary flow of liquid moisture and internal evaporation is developed to account for the whole drying process and simulations of the scanned pellet are validated with good agreement. The result clearly shows four stages of drying; i) evaporation of liquid moisture at the pellet surface, ii) surface evaporation coexisting with internal drying as the surface is locally dry, iii) internal evaporation with completely dry surface and iv) internal evaporation at boiling temperatures. A moisture front moving towards the core of the pellet will start to develop at the second drying stage and the results show that the front will have a non-symmetrical form arising from the surrounding fluid flow. With the developed drying model, simulations are then carried out on a spherical pellet with aim to investigate how the inlet air humidity affects drying. The results indicates that the effect of air dew point arise from the start of the first drying period, i. e the surface evaporation period, while the difference is reduced at the end of the period due to a prolonged stage of constant rate drying attained at high dew points. The wet-bulb temperature is increased with humidity and condensation will occur if the pellet surface temperature is below the dew point. Furthermore it is found that the moisture gradients at the surface and inside the pellet are increased with drying rate.
