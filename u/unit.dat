5|$|However, more conveniently, {{a pair of}} indices (n,m) is used instead. The indices {{refer to}} equally long <b>unit</b> vectors at 60° angles to each other across a single 6-member carbon ring.

Another four Dakotas were sent to Japan due to operational demands. The unit's role in Korea was to support No.77 (Fighter) Squadron by transporting supplies and equipment. It also delivered materials and stores to Australian and Commonwealth ground forces, and transported VIPs of the United Nations Command. Return journeys to Japan were often used to evacuate wounded personnel from the theatre. No.30 Communications <b>Unit</b> was redesignated No.30 Transport <b>Unit</b> in November 1951, and re-formed as No.36 (Transport) Squadron in March 1953.
