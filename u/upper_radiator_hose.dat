50|$|Engineers paid {{particular}} attention to engine cooling, {{in order to make}} the <b>radiator</b> and its <b>hoses</b> as inconspicuous as possible, yet still function effectively. This was achieved by running the top <b>radiator</b> <b>hose</b> underneath a valve cover, and by situating a thin radiator between the downtubes of the double-cradle frame. The Fury was given a five-speed transmission and a shaft-drive system similar to its VTX predecessors, but the shaft was enclosed by an aluminum swingarm assembly unique to the Fury.|$|R
50|$|All 335 Series V8s {{shared the}} same 4.38 in bore spacing and {{cylinder}} head bolt pattern as the Windsor V8s. Beyond these shared aspects, the 335 Series engines are very different internally from the somewhat similar-looking Windsor series. The 335 series V8s use smaller 14mm spark plugs and the <b>radiator</b> <b>hose</b> locations differ between the Windsor and 335 engines. The Windsor engines route coolant through the intake manifold, with the hose protruding horizontally, while the 335 engines had a dry manifold with the <b>radiator</b> <b>hose</b> connecting vertically to the cylinder block above the cam timing chain cover. The Cleveland has a square-shaped rocker cover while the Windsor has a more rounded cover. All 335 covers are secured with eight bolts; the Windsor uses six bolts. All of the 335 series engines differ from the Windsor engines by having a roughly 2-inch extension {{at the front of}} the block which forms an integrated timing cover casting.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this study, for EPDM rubber {{conventionally}} {{used as a}} <b>radiator</b> <b>hose</b> material {{the aging}} behaviors of the skin part under the electro-chemical stresses were nondestructively evaluated. On account of the penetration of coolant liquid into the skin part the weight of rubber specimens degraded by ECD test increased, whereas their failure strain and IRHD hardness decreased largely. The penetration of coolant liquid seemed to induce some changes in inner structure and micro hardness distribution of the rubbers. Consequently, EPDM rubbers degraded by ECD could be characterized nondestructively by micro-hardness and chemical structure analysis methods...|$|R

50|$|At {{one point}} in this second chase, Mann observes a {{black-and-white}} car. Thinking that the vehicle is a police car, he skids to a stop, only for him {{to realize that the}} vehicle is actually a pest control vehicle. He speeds off as the driver of the pest control vehicle scarpers onto his own vehicle's hood as the chase continues. The truck then chases Mann up a mountain ascent, before the <b>radiator</b> <b>hose</b> of Mann's car falls off, causing the car to quickly overheat. He barely makes the summit before coasting his car downhill in neutral to cool the temperature of his vehicle's engine as the truck gradually bears down on him.|$|R
500|$|Paving of SR84 had {{commenced}} by 1934, {{with the}} portion of the highway in Maricopa County being paved. A group of San Diego citizens raised concerns about the road from Yuma to Gila Bend not being paved in 1934, due to the impact that this would have on tourism in San Diego, and made a request to the federal government to have it paved. The entire future corridor of I-8 had been paved from Yuma to Casa Grande by 1935. Drivers were told to bring spare fan belts, <b>radiator</b> <b>hoses,</b> and additional drinking water for the journey traversing the desert. A [...] "Shortcuts Association" [...] began in 1952 to promote SR84 as a route to bypass Phoenix on the way to San Diego.|$|R

Grace says that when she blamed Jake's death on Bobby, she was merely baiting the Sheriff so she could kill him, much like Bobby baited Jake when he said he would kill Grace. As Bobby stands over the edge looking down at Jake, Grace pushes him over the cliff, severely injuring him. She gets in the car to drive off before realizing that Bobby has taken the keys. Bobby pleads with her to come down and help him. When she gets close enough however, he strangles her. He then makes the grueling journey back up the cliff with a broken leg.

25|$|The second {{prototype}} introduced <b>upper</b> wing <b>radiators</b> {{in lieu of}} {{the frontal}} radiator and large cut-outs in the lower wing roots, to improve the pilot's downward vision. These features proved unsuccessful and were omitted from subsequent aircraft. The third and fourth prototypes incorporated numerous modifications to the <b>radiator,</b> <b>upper</b> fuselage decking, fin and rudder.

50|$|A second start {{was allowed}} by the race authorities, and the {{aircraft}} was returned to Southampton by rail. The second attempt started on Monday 25 August when Hawker and Kauper took off at 5.30 am. Flying via Ramsgate, Yarmouth and Scarborough, Seaham - where an unscheduled hour stop was made to effect repairs and replace lost radiator water - and ending the day at Beadnell, about 20 mi short of the control point at Berwick-on-Tweed, due {{to one of the}} <b>radiator</b> <b>hoses</b> having been burnt through. The next day they left Beadnell at 8.05, stopping at Montrose, Aberdeen and Cromarty and reaching Oban on the west coast of Scotland at six in the evening, and took off on the third day at 5.42 am; after a stop at Kiells due to engine problems Larne was reached at 9.30. At 11 they took off for Dublin, but a few miles short of their destination Hawker decided to land in order to make adjustments to the engine valves. Unfortunately his foot slipped from the rudder bar and the aircraft sideslipped into the water, breaking Kauper's arm and damaging the aircraft too seriously for the flight to be continued.|$|R
25|$|The Bf 109 G-series was {{developed}} from the largely identical F-series airframe, although there were detail differences. Modifications included a reinforced wing structure, an internal bullet-proof windscreen, the use of heavier, welded framing for the cockpit transparencies, and additional light-alloy armour for the fuel tank. It was originally intended that the wheel wells would incorporate small doors to cover the outer portion of the wheels when retracted. To incorporate these the outer wheel bays were squared off. Two small inlet scoops for additional cooling of the spark plugs were added {{on both sides of}} the forward engine cowlings. A less obvious difference was the omission of the boundary layer bypass outlets, which had been a feature of the F-series, on the <b>upper</b> <b>radiator</b> flaps.|$|R

40|$|Cooling {{system in}} the engine {{functions}} as the protector of the machine by absorbing the heat. Heat engine is produced by fuel in the cylinder. The heat is deliberately created to generate energy, but it will cause excessive heat if it is left unchecked (over heating effect). In order to prevent overheating and keep the machine temperature, then it uses radiator. How effective radiator is used {{can be seen by}} using a tool called a radiator tester. Therefore, this research was Designed a Trial Radiator (Radiator Tester) Laboratory Scale Which is Completed by Round Handler 2 ̆ 7 s Machine and Regulator Wind Blower on Diesel Engine L 300. This research was done by testing the car L 300 diesel in the field then noted rpm and air speed that blew into the radiator.

50|$|During launch {{preparations}} at Kennedy, technicians {{noticed a}} small {{section of the}} aft <b>radiator</b> retract <b>hose</b> that was bent in a shape similar to the Greek letter Omega. The hose {{is part of the}} shuttle's cooling system that carries Freon, and is designed to flex when the payload bay doors are opened and closed. Making sure they were not overlooking potential problems, NASA engineers designed a tool to guide the hose back into the storage box, and performed the procedure on 3 February 2008. Engineers would monitor the hose during STS-122, and in the unlikely event that it were to begin leaking Freon, the shuttle's computers would turn off the redundant radiator system before any Freon had a chance to leak out.|$|R
50|$|On the Escort's first outing at World Championship level, the 1993 Monte Carlo Rally, Delecour {{took the}} lead with Biasion second. The pair led the event until the final night, when a late charge by Didier Auriol, driving a Toyota Celica, saw him win, with the Fords second and third. Nevertheless, the new car had {{demonstrated}} its potential, which was underlined the following month when Malcolm Wilson, driving a car prepared by his own team, briefly led the Swedish Rally before retiring after an accident. The works team returned for the Portuguese Rally: Delecour led almost from the start and won the event with Biasion second, establishing both car and driver as serious contenders for that year's World Championship. Delecour won again in Corsica, and Biasion in Greece - his first win for three years - putting them first and second in the drivers' championship, and Ford in the joint lead in the manufacturers' title. However, {{during the second half}} of the season Toyota driver Juha Kankkunen won in Argentina, Finland and Australia, whilst with the exception of Delecour's second place (behind Colin McRae) in New Zealand the Fords' results were relatively poor, giving Toyota the manufacturers' title. Both works Escorts then retired on the San Remo Rally, Delecour after an accident and Biasion with engine failure after a <b>radiator</b> <b>hose</b> split, but the event was won by Italian Franco Cunico, in a privately entered Escort Cosworth. It was the first time in several years that a privateer had won at this level, and in doing so he outpaced the works Lancia Delta Integrale of reigning World Champion Carlos Sainz, demonstrating the superiority of the Escort over the previously dominant Lancia. Nevertheless, the result was a disappointment for Ford since, although Delecour won the penultimate round of the season, in Catalunya, he lost the world title to Kankkunen.|$|R
5000|$|Shortly {{after leaving}} the school bus, Mann stops his car at a {{railroad}} crossing to allow a passing freight train to cross his path when—unbeknownst to him—the truck arrives behind his vehicle, stops, then immediately attempts to push his car {{into the path of}} the passing train. In response, Mann places his own vehicle in reverse as he repeatedly shouts, [...] " [...] Hey, stop!" [...] After the train passes, Mann then frantically crosses the tracks and drives up an embankment out of the path of the truck, which calmly continues to drive ahead. He then slowly drives his vehicle before observing the truck deliberately driving in an extremely slow speed in an evident effort to allow his vehicle to catch his own. In response to this observation, Mann raises his neck, and slows his own vehicle's speed.Mann then stops at a gas station to call the police and agrees to the operative's offer to both replace his <b>radiator</b> <b>hose</b> and fill his car with gasoline; however, when Mann steps into station's only phone booth to report the truck driver's behavior, the driver of the truck drives into the booth. Although Mann jumps clear of the booth just prior to the truck striking him, several reptile cases at the station are also struck, and he has to remove a tarantula from his trouser leg. Although he asks the sole operative at the station to phone the police, she replies: [...] "With what? That's the only phone that I've got!" [...] Immediately, Mann enters his car and speeds away as the truck resumes chasing his vehicle. Around a nearby corner, he rapidly pulls off the road, reversing to hide behind an embankment as the truck speeds past.|$|R
40|$|Many {{techniques}} have been explored {{to reduce the}} overall size of a microstrip patch conductor in the low microwave frequency spectrum. These include using shorting pins and high dielectric constant material. Perforating or meshing the microstrip patch conductor {{has also been shown}} to give reasonable size reductions for a conventional patch antenna without compromising its radiation and impedance performance. We present a perforated shorted printed antenna which uses a shorting post as well as perforation slots that are embedded within the single layer printed antenna to reduce the surface area of the antenna. The antenna is small, with its overall dimensions of 0. 13 ? 0 × 0. 12 ? 0 × 0. 07 ? 0 making its size compatible with most portable devices. We also present a variation of the perforated shorted patch that allows multifrequency operation. This new printed antenna consists of a stacked shorted patch geometry, where the lower frequency element is fed by a probe and the <b>upper</b> frequency <b>radiator</b> is electromagnetically coupled to the feed. The lower frequency radiator is a perforated shorted patch. The <b>upper</b> frequency <b>radiator</b> is located below the other element and is {{in the shape of a}} shorted ring...|$|R

50|$|An {{engineering}} {{option was}} designed to {{reduce the power loss}} due to engine radiator fan operation and to increase the heat available for heating of the passengers. After experiments by Wing-Commander T.R. Cave-Browne-Cave (CBC), Professor of Engineering at Southampton University, a satisfactory design was produced. The 'CBC' system involved two small engine radiators being placed above the driver's cab roof level at the front outer corners of the double deck to give maximum aerodynamic air flow. The engine coolant water was pumped around these instead of the traditional radiator. In cold weather, all or a portion of the air passing through these radiators, was diverted by flaps, the left into the upper saloon and the right to the lower deck. In hot weather, the flaps could be changed by push-pull levers in the driver's cab roof to divert all the hot air to the outside of the vehicle. The movement of the vehicle was (usually) adequate to cool the engine without the need for a fan or radiator at the traditional position in front of the engine. The traditional 'radiator' grille {{at the front of the}} vehicle was not required, but was usually retained (with a few exceptions) and blanked off behind. 'Varivane' wax capsule operated shutters were fitted in front of the <b>upper</b> <b>radiators</b> to keep the coolant at optimum temperature. There were some disadvantages to the scheme and eventually customers stopped specifying it.|$|R
25|$|The {{most common}} type is an {{electric}} heating element in the cylinder block, connected through a power cord often routed through the vehicle's grille. The block heater may replace one of the engine's core plugs. In this fashion, the heater element is immersed in the engine's coolant, which then keeps most of the engine warm. This type of heater does not come with a pump. They may also be installed in line {{with one of the}} <b>radiator</b> or heater <b>hoses.</b> Some heaters pump and circulate the engine coolant while heating, others only heat the still coolant in the reservoir.|$|R

5000|$|The Super Duty was {{introduced}} in 1958, {{the same year as}} the FE and MEL series V8 engines, as a replacement for the Lincoln Y-block in truck applications. The Super Duty was available in displacements of 401, 477 and 534 cubic inches (6.6L, 7.8L and 8.8L). These engines were large, heavy, high torque engines and operated at a relatively low RPM. They were never designed as automobile engines and were commonly found in large, industrial use vehicles including dump trucks, garbage trucks, concrete mixing trucks, large buses and other medium and heavy duty trucks of the time. The Super Duty engine was built in Ford's Cleveland engine plant number 2. They had a unique intake system where the intake dumped into the head and all four cylinders pulled the mixture out of a log type port in the head. They could spit when cold and blow the choke plate out into the air cleaner because of the large port configuration. In later engines this was corrected; they had a spider type intake more modern style. The exhaust valves were sodium filled that when hot it liquefied and carried heat away from the valve head and took it to the valve spring that dispensed heat into the oil coming off the rocker arm which is the reason for a water to oil cooler. The piston assembly weighed three times more than other gas engine manufactures. The block was unique in that it was a 90 degree v 8 but the top deck was 60 degrees. The head was flat on the combustion chamber side so by doing this they achieved a wedge combustion chamber. With this design it left a big hole so they put a large pop top piston to try to displace some volume. They used a deep skirted block for strength. They governed these at about 3400 rpm due to their great rotating mass. When ford built the 385 series engine and started to change over a 460 or 429 weighed about half of the 477.
