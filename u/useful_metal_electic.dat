50|$|Ore {{concentrate}}, {{dressed ore}} or simply concentrate {{is the product}} generally produced by metal ore mines. The raw ore is usually ground finely in various comminution operations and gangue (waste) is removed, thus concentrating the metal component.

50|$|Leaching is {{extensively}} used {{in metal}} processing industries. The <b>useful</b> <b>metal</b> may occur in mixtures with very {{large amounts of}} undesirable constituents, and leaching is used to remove the metals as soluble salts. The use of acids is prevalent in the metal processing industry. Sulfates are normally used to remove metals from the solid phase. These processes result in harmful sulfate-rich environmental byproducts. Because acids solubilize metals, large-scale release of heavy-metal-rich acidic mine drainage (AMD) can thereby occur.|$|R

50|$|All animals need {{significant}} amounts of sulfur. Some amino acids, such as cysteine and methionine contain sulfur. Plant roots take up sulfate ions from the soil and reduce it to sulfide ions.

40|$|Early US waste-to-energy {{plants were}} {{constructed}} using conventional boilers designed for fossil fuels, gas, and oil. Combusting MSW exposed those boilers {{to high levels}} of sulfides and chlorides that caused accelerated corrosion problems. MSW fuel required higher amounts of excess air that resulted in high furnace gas velocities and metal erosion. Depending upon the individual design of each boiler, effects of higher upper furnace temperature, flame impingement, and flyash carry over were reported.

50|$|Lithium-ion {{batteries}} and lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries often contain among other <b>useful</b> <b>metals</b> high-grade copper and aluminium {{in addition to}} - depending on the active material - transition metals cobalt and nickel as well as rare earths. To prevent a future shortage of cobalt, nickel, and lithium and to enable a sustainable life cycle of these technologies, recycling processes for lithium batteries are needed. These processes have to regain not only cobalt, nickel, copper, and aluminum from spent battery cells, but also a significant share of lithium.In order to achieve this goal, several unit operations are combined to complex process chains, especially considering the task to recover high rates of valuable materials with regard to involved safety issues.|$|R
50|$|The Ramberg-Osgood {{equation}} {{was created}} to describe the non linear relationship between stress and strain—that is, the stress-strain curve—in materials near their yield points.

However, polymer membranes for outdoor usages such as, an air quality monitoring and membrane reservoirs for the selective recovery of <b>useful</b> <b>metals</b> from seawater, have been newly developed. Thus it is required to investigate the prop-erties of the membrane for the outdoor use and also studies of the accelerated UV exposure onto the polymeric membranes are essential to estimate their weatherability. Herein, we report on the thermal and mechanical properties, morphology changes, and color differences of the polysulfone anisotropic membranes and non-woven type polypropylene membranes with the accel-erated UV exposure. Results showed that the effect of UV exposure on the membrane depend not only on the polymer use...|$|R
40|$|An {{eigenvalue}} {{equation is}} derived for stratified metallic optical slab waveguides with {{any number of}} layers. The equation is solved using the numerical zoom analysis (NZA) method. The analysis is applied to various metallic optical slabs and the propagation characteristics of the guided waves are determined, which may be useful for optimizing the design parameters. It is found possible, with proper optimization, to design a polarizer having hundreds of decibels of extinction ratio {{at the cost of}} a fraction of a decibel of insertion loss. Examples of optimizations with respect to wavelength, relative refractive indices, core/clad geometries, etc. are demonstrated for slabs with single or double metal layers.

40|$|Results are {{presented}} on {{the reactions of}} Au, Ag, and Bi ions with Ba 2 YCu 3 O(7 -y) oxides and on {{the properties of the}} resultant materials.

Silver is structurally and chemically compatible with the perovskite structure, but when it forms a second phase, it does so without the destruction of the superconducting phase, making silver a <b>useful</b> <b>metal</b> for metal/ceramic applications. On the other hand, bismuth was shown to degrade Tc phase or to form other phases, indicating that it may not be useful in applications with rare-earth-based superconductors...|$|R
50|$|Some primary {{stocks of}} rare but <b>useful</b> <b>metals</b> are already running low. For example, rhenium only occurs at seven {{parts per billion}} in the Earth’s crust, {{making it one of}} the rarest {{elements}} on the planet. However, its high melting point of 3,186 °C makes it valuable in the manufacture of jet engines. Demand for the metal is rising, with increasing air travel, but its rarity means increasing extraction is not simple. This is where recycling comes in; rhenium is one of the few metals that has witnessed a rise in recycling rates. It is likely that recycling will become a more viable option than extraction for other metals in future, saving energy, cutting greenhouse gases emitted to the atmosphere and reducing negative impacts on the environment.|$|R
40|$|Electrolysis of {{silicate}} melts {{has been}} shown to be an effective means of producing metals from common silicate materials. No fluxing agents need be added to the melts. From solution in melts of diopside (CaMgSi 2 O 6) composition, the elements Si, Ti, Ni, and Fe have been reduced to their metallic states. Platinum is a satisfactory anode material, but other cathode materials are needed. Electrolysis of compositional analogs of lunar rocks initially produces iron metal at the cathode and oxygen gas at the anode. Utilizing mainly heat and electricity which are readily available from sunlight, direct electrolysis is capable of producing <b>useful</b> <b>metals</b> from common feedstocks without the need for expendable chemicals. This simple process and the products obtained from it deserve further study for use in materials processing in space...|$|R
50|$|The Oquirrh Mountains {{have been}} mined for gold, silver, lead, and most famously for copper, as {{home of the}} {{porphyry}} copper deposit at Bingham Canyon Mine, one of the world's largest open pit mines. As seen from Salt Lake City, {{the view of the}} mountain range is dominated by the displaced rock material (known as overburden) dug from the Kennecott mine. At {{the north end of the}} range is Kennecott's smelter complex which refines ore concentrates from the mine into <b>useful</b> <b>metals.</b> Dark colored tailings from past metal refining at the complex can be observed from the adjacent freeway, I-80. The value of the minerals taken from the range has been estimated to far exceed the combined value of those taken in the California, Nevada, and Klondike gold and silver rushes.|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} at Kleinwaltersdorf, near Freiberg in the Electorate of Saxony, on 2 January 1800. His father, though only a poor working miner, found the means to have him educated first at the Bergschule (mining school) {{and then at the}} Bergakademie of Freiberg. After he had {{completed}} his courses there in 1820 he obtained employment, chiefly as an assayer, in connexion with the royal mines and metal works. Having taken up the idea of quantitative mouth blowpipe assaying, which was then almost unknown, he succeeded in devising dependable methods for all the ordinary <b>useful</b> <b>metals.</b> In particular his modes of assaying for nickel and cobalt quickly found favour with metallurgists. He also devoted himself to the improvement of qualitative blowpipe analysis, and summed up his experience in a treatise Die Probierkunst mit dem Löthrohr (1835), which became a standard authority.|$|R
40|$|As {{the result}} of {{identifying}} content of each chemical element it has been revealed that metallic mineral wastes have {{a considerable amount of}} valuable <b>useful</b> <b>metals.</b> Thus, large-tonnage inorganic wastes are considered to be an additional raw source of metal production. This paper highlights the necessity of supplementary biotesting metallic mineral wastes in order to bring into correlation with corresponding hazard classes and facilitate efficient recycling of these wastes in future. It has been found out that determined in this way waste class can be dumped or used after recycling. It has been also indicated that mill tailings are to be stored according to contained metals without messing up dissimilar metal-containing wastes. After winning metals these wastes are similar to the group of inorganic non-metallic wastes and can be used in building material production, for filling mined-out spaces, in road construction etc...|$|R

50|$|Typically, raw {{materials}} such as metal ores or agricultural products such as foodstuffs or textile source plants (cotton, flax) require a sequence of treatments to render them <b>useful.</b> For <b>metal,</b> the processes include crushing, smelting and further refining.

40|$|Drilling {{is one of}} {{the most}} <b>useful</b> <b>metal</b> cutting {{processes}} and is used in various applications, such as aerospace, electronics, and automotive. In traditional drilling methods, the thrust force, torque, tolerance, and tribology (surface roughness) are related to the cutting condition and tool geometry. In this paper, the effects of a pre-center drill hole, tool material, and drilling strategy (including continuous and non-continuous feed) on thrust force, surface roughness, and dimensional accuracy (cylindricity) have been investigated. The results show that using pre-center drill holes leads to a reduction of the engagement force and an improvement in the surface quality and cylindricity. Non-continuous drilling reduces the average thrust force and cylindricity value, and High Speed Steels HSS-Mo (high steel speed + 5 – 8 % Mo) reduces the maximum quantity of cutting forces. Moreover, cylindricity is directly related to cutting temperature and is improved by using a non-continuous drilling strategy...|$|R
