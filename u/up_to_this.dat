5|$|In stage nine, Pierre Rolland, who {{was second}} in the {{mountains}} classification, wore the polka dot jersey, because Chris Froome wore the yellow jersey {{as leader of the}} general classification during that stage. Froome and Rolland both had collected 31 points <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> point, but Froome claimed the polka dot jersey, because he had crossed the line as first on first category mountains more often than Rolland.|$|E
5|$|In the 2002–03 WNCL, Ebsary {{played in}} all eight matches, but was given less {{responsibility}} {{with the ball}} and had little success. She bowled only 23 overs and took two wickets at 34.00. She also had little effect with the bat, scoring 63 runs at 11.50 with a best score of 18. South Australia won five of their matches, narrowly missing the finals. <b>Up</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> point her batting average in 16 completed innings was 8.37.|$|E

5|$|The {{inevitable}} {{consequence of}} demands for ever greater speed, striking power, and endurance meant that displacement, and hence cost, of dreadnoughts tended to increase. The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 imposed {{a limit of}} 35,000 tons on the displacement of capital ships. In subsequent years treaty battleships were commissioned to build <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> limit. Japan's decision to leave the Treaty in the 1930s, {{and the arrival of}} the Second World War, eventually made this limit irrelevant.|$|E
5|$|<b>Up</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> point, Australia's {{performances}} {{had been}} poor, and winter athletes were often derided by the summer-dominated administrators.

The chairman said that a seventh place would be needed, {{and went on to}} explain that a dog was required to find the athletes after they got lost in the snow. The majority of his colleagues burst into laughter.|$|E

5|$|Although Etty had {{traditionally}} {{worked in}} the Venetian style of painting, with rich colours and detail, for Musidora he adopted a much softer and earthier palette, although his use of reflected light on flesh is derived from Venetian styles. He moved away from Rubens, who <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> time had been his greatest influence, {{and closer to the}} style of Titian. This is likely owing {{to the nature of the}} subject matter. Until then his history paintings had primarily been of themes of classical mythology, and took place in brightly lit Mediterranean settings. The Seasons, by contrast, was seen as an explicitly English work, requiring a more muted palette to deal with the typical lighting conditions of Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the weather}} had been mostly rainy <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> point in the campaign, a snow storm arrived the night of February 13, with strong winds that brought {{temperatures}} down to 10–12°F (−12°C) and deposited 3inches (8cm) of snow by morning. Guns and wagons were frozen to the earth. Because of {{the proximity of the}} enemy lines and the active sharpshooters, the soldiers could not light campfires for warmth or cooking, and both sides were miserable that night, many having arrived without blankets or overcoats.|$|E
5|$|Angelou's {{primary role}} in Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas was stage performer, but in The Heart of a Woman she changes {{from someone who}} uses others' method of expression—the songs and dances of the African, Caribbean, and African-American oral tradition—to a writer. Angelou makes this {{decision}} for political reasons as she becomes more involved with the civil rights movement, and {{so that she can}} care for her son. For the first time in Angelou's autobiographies, she begins to think of herself as a writer and recounts her literary development. Angelou begins to identify with other Black women writers {{for the first time in}} The Heart of a Woman. She has been influenced by several writers since her childhood, but this is the first time she mentions female authors. <b>Up</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> point, her identification has been with male writers; her new affiliations with female writers is due to her emerging feminism.|$|E

5|$|At first, {{tenacious}} KPA defense {{halted the}} Marines who responded with artillery, raking Cloverleaf Hill. Heavy indirect fire forced the North Koreans {{out of their}} positions before the Marines and Task Force Hill eventually overwhelmed them, one hill at a time. The Marines approached Obong-ni first, destroying resistance on the slope with an airstrike and a barrage from US tanks, but strong resistance caused heavy casualties, {{and they had to}} withdraw. The 18th North Korean Regiment, in control of the hill, mounted a disastrous counterattack in hopes of pushing the Marines back. The division's tactics of cutting off supplies and relying on surprise, which had provided them so much success <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> point, failed in the face of massive US numerical superiority.|$|E
5|$|Belgian Eddy Merckx was the {{dominant}} figure during the 1970s.

Felice Gimondi was victorious in 1976 winning his third Giro. Belgians Michel Pollentier and Johan De Muynck won the two subsequent Giros in 1977 and 1978. In 1980, Frenchman Bernard Hinault who <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> point had won two Tours de France, became France's first winner since Anquetil in 1964.

After a chance meeting with members of Fear, she invited drummer Andrew Jaimez, bassist Mando Lopez, and guitarist Richard Presley to jam with her at the studio she was renting. Deal wanted to continue playing with these musicians, and so within three months she moved to Fear's hometown Los Angeles. Jaimez, Lopez, and Presley joined the Breeders, and Kelley Deal rejoined the group soon after. About a month after Kim Deal's arrival, Jose Medeles replaced Jaimez, who decided he did not have enough time for the Breeders because of his involvement in other musical projects. The new line-up spent the rest of the year writing and rehearsing.|$|E
