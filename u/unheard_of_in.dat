5|$|The {{principal}} reception {{rooms are}} on the ground floor with large sash windows opening immediately into the porticos and the colonnades, and therefore onto the gardens, a situation <b>unheard</b> <b>of</b> <b>in</b> the grand villas and palaces of Renaissance Italy. The mansion contains a series of 18th century salons decorated and furnished in the style of that period, with polychrome marble floors, and painted ceilings depicting classical scenes of Greek and Roman mythology. Of particular note is the entrance hall, which resembles a Roman atrium with marbled columns and a painted ceiling copied from Robert Wood's Ruins of Palmyra.|$|E
5|$|The {{songs on}} Road to Ruin were {{considered}} by both fans and critics {{as an attempt}} to get the band more airplay. The album incorporated musical elements which were <b>unheard</b> <b>of</b> <b>in</b> punk rock, such as guitar solos and ballads. The difference in style caused for mixed reviews by critics, with many pointing out that the band was trying to sell more records through a change in form. This attempt by the band failed, as Road to Ruin debuted at 103 on the Billboard 200, nearly 50 places behind its predecessor Rocket to Russia.|$|E
5|$|Citizen Kane eschews the {{traditional}} linear, chronological narrative, and tells Kane's story entirely in flashback using {{different points of}} view, many of them from Kane's aged and forgetful associates, the cinematic equivalent of the unreliable narrator in literature. Welles also dispenses {{with the idea of}} a single storyteller and uses multiple narrators to recount Kane's life. The use of multiple narrators was <b>unheard</b> <b>of</b> <b>in</b> Hollywood films. Each narrator recounts a different part of Kane's life, with each story partly overlapping. The film depicts Kane as an enigma, a complicated man who, in the end, leaves viewers with more questions than answers as to his character, such as the newsreel footage where he is attacked for being both a communist and a fascist.|$|E
50|$|Nitish also {{introduced}} monitoring of IAY completions through satellite based geo tagged and time stamped photography. This was an <b>unheard</b> <b>of</b> practice <b>in</b> Bihar and unparalleled in IAY monitoring in the nation.|$|R

2500|$|The 1950–1955 Nash Rambler was {{the first}} model run for this {{automobile}} platform. Using the same tooling, AMC reintroduced an almost identical [...] "new" [...] 1958 Rambler American for a second model run. This was a rare feat of having two distinct and successful model runs, an almost <b>unheard</b> <b>of</b> phenomenon <b>in</b> automobile history.|$|R
5|$|In 1530 Vermigli was {{appointed}} vicar {{of the monastery}} at San Giovanni in Monte, Bologna. There he learned Hebrew from a local Jewish doctor so he could read the Old Testament scriptures in their original language. Even among those who sought deeper biblical study, it was uncommon for clergy to learn Hebrew, though not <b>unheard</b> <b>of.</b> <b>In</b> 1533 the chapter-general elected Vermigli abbot of the two Lateran monasteries in Spoleto. At this post he was also responsible for two convents. The discipline in the monastic houses in Vermigli's care had been lax before his arrival, and they had {{become a source of}} scandal in Spoleto. There was also a history of power struggle between the Bishop of Spoleto, Francesco Eroli, and the Spoletan abbacy, {{to the point that the}} bishop had excommunicated Vermigli's predecessor, only to be overturned by Rome. Vermigli brought order to his houses and mended the relationship with the bishop.|$|E
5|$|Marriages among ruling dynasties {{and their}} {{subjects}} have at times been common, with the marriages {{such as that}} of Edward the Confessor, King of England with Edith of Wessex and Władysław II Jagiełło, King of Poland with Elizabeth Granowska being far from <b>unheard</b> <b>of</b> <b>in</b> medieval Europe. However, as dynasties approached absolutism and sought to preserve loyalty among competing members of the nobility, most eventually distanced themselves from kinship ties to local nobles by marrying abroad. Marriages with subjects brought the king back down to the level of those he ruled, often stimulating the ambition of his consort's family and evoking jealousy—or disdain—from the nobility. The notion that monarchs should marry into the dynasties of other monarchs to end or prevent war was, at first, a policy driven by pragmatism. During the era of absolutism, this practice contributed to the notion that it was socially, as well as politically, disadvantageous for members of ruling families to intermarry with their subjects and pass over the opportunity for marriage into a foreign dynasty.|$|E
25|$|But the {{authorities}} {{could not find}} evidence to charge him.

25|$|The {{immediate}} {{scientific and}} medical {{response to the}} 1984 Bhopal disaster constituted an extraordinary pulling together of hospitals, medical personnel and social services in the area. Coping with a disaster of this scale was <b>unheard</b> <b>of</b> anywhere <b>in</b> the world, and there was widespread admiration for those who responded, often risking their own lives in the process.|$|R
2500|$|First as the Nash Rambler {{and then}} as two generations of the Rambler American, this {{automobile}} platform performed the rare feat of having two distinct and successful model runs, an almost <b>unheard</b> <b>of</b> phenomenon <b>in</b> automobile history.

25|$|For delaying reasons {{described}} in the article Pseudo-Isidore, but also because his crucial demands for capital punishment had been so <b>unheard</b> <b>of</b> <b>in</b> ecclesiastical history priorly based upon the humane Christian concept of forgiveness and mercy, it took several centuries before Benedict's demands for legal reform began to take tangible shape within larger ecclesiastical initiatives.|$|E
25|$|Brann were {{promoted}} {{back into}} the top league in 1967, and Brann won the Cup Championship two times in the 1970s. Once in 1972 defeating Rosenborg 1–0. And again in 1976 defeating Sogndal 2–1. In each of the seasons 1974–1976, Brann narrowly missed out on the league title, attracting an average attendance that was <b>unheard</b> <b>of</b> <b>in</b> Norway at the time.|$|E

Warlocks, sorcerers, and artificers are standard classes available for play in the 4th edition setting. Other arcane spell casters such as sorcerers, and warlocks, or were not included until the Paizo later version <b>of</b> the setting <b>in</b> 2004. In 4th edition any arcane caster was ostensibly available if the dungeon master allowed it.|$|R

50|$|The {{distribution}} <b>of</b> gangs <b>in</b> Vice City circa 1984 {{is significantly}} different {{due largely to}} activities surrounding the Vance Crime Family, which rose to prominence that year. Their subsequent dominance has devastated a number of existing gangs which previously had a significant stake in the city. <b>In</b> the beginning <b>of</b> GTA Vice City Stories, a number <b>of</b> previously <b>unheard</b> <b>of</b> gangs <b>in</b> Vice City are also present before they disbanded or were wiped out by Victor Vance and his organization.|$|R
25|$|Coins {{with the}} obverse and reverse {{inscriptions}} 'AVDVLFVS FRISIA' and 'VICTVRIA AVDVLFO', {{as well as}} 'FRISIA' and 'AVDVLFVS' have been found at Escharen, a village in the Dutch province of North Brabant. The stylistic quality suggests that they are of Northern Frankish origin of that era rather than Frisian, besides which a local production using a self-descriptive country name (i.e., 'FRISIA') would be <b>unheard</b> <b>of</b> <b>in</b> that era.|$|E
25|$|Melbourne Trades Hall {{was opened}} in 1859 with Trades and Labour Councils and Trades Halls opening in all cities and most {{regional}} {{towns in the}} following forty years. During the 1880s Trade unions developed among shearers, miners, and stevedores (wharf workers), but soon spread to cover almost all blue-collar jobs. Shortages of labour led to high wages for a prosperous skilled working class, whose unions demanded and got an eight-hour day and other benefits <b>unheard</b> <b>of</b> <b>in</b> Europe.|$|E
25|$|In February 2011 it was {{announced}} that Ronaldo would be given one last match for Brazil, a friendly against Romania in São Paulo on 7 June 2011, five years after his last match with the national team. Despite it being almost <b>unheard</b> <b>of</b> <b>in</b> international football for players to be given a farewell match for their national side, Brazilian Football Confederation officials stated that given the extraordinary career of Ronaldo, it was only fitting that his final game should take place in Brazil while representing his nation.|$|E
50|$|A Deluxe size figure. The {{figure was}} {{packaged}} on a Decepticon cardback, {{and that the}} characters profile in the Transformers Collectors Club magazine also included a Decepticon symbol. The actual story featuring the character, however, presents him as unaffiliated, serving only his own ends. In line with this, the toy lacks a faction symbol - a rare but not <b>unheard</b> <b>of</b> occurrence <b>in</b> the Transformers line, with examples including Micromasters, the Generation 2 Go-Bots, Cybertron Safeguard, SDCC exclusive Skywarp, and movie Armorhide.|$|R

25|$|At its height, {{just before}} the Spanish arrived, Tenochtitlan {{was the center of}} the vast Aztec Empire, {{stretching}} from the Atlantic to Pacific coasts and south towards the Yucatán Peninsula and Oaxaca. With a vast income of tribute, Tenochtitlan grew to become one of the largest and richest urban areas in the world at that time. The city had services and infrastructure that was <b>unheard</b> <b>of</b> <b>in</b> the rest of the world: potable water brought in by aqueducts, drainage systems and wide, paved streets. Their markets boasted of products from nearly every part of Mesoamerica.|$|E

He entered 1954 Chrysler New Yorker club coupes in the AAA Milwaukee Mile and won all three races entered. Tony Bettenhausen and Frank Mundy drove. He then purchased large and powerful Chrysler 300s to use in NASCAR for the 1955 season. Kiekhaefer was a millionaire, so he could afford the expensive cars unlike the other teams. He bought the best equipment, and had a team, as well as transporters, <b>unheard</b> <b>of</b> <b>in</b> NASCAR at the time.|$|E
25|$|The Nuremberg trials {{initiated}} a movement for the prompt {{establishment of a}} permanent international criminal court, eventually leading over fifty years later {{to the adoption of}} the Statute of the International Criminal Court. This movement was brought about because during the trials, there were conflicting court methods between the German court system and the U.S. court system. The crime of conspiracy was <b>unheard</b> <b>of</b> <b>in</b> the civil law systems of the Continent. Therefore, the German defense found it unfair to charge the defendants with conspiracy to commit crimes, while the judges from common-law countries were used to doing so.|$|E
50|$|Although {{violent crime}} inside public toilets in {{relatively}} rare, {{it is not}} <b>unheard</b> <b>of,</b> particularly <b>in</b> areas where the violent crime rate in general is very high. In South Africa for instance, many people have reported being afraid to use public toilets. There have been several highly publicized murders in public toilets, such as the Seocho-dong public toilet murder case. In the US, an infamous case was {{the murder of a}} 9-years-old boy in 1998 in a San Diego county public toilet (the murderer was sentenced to death and committed suicide in 2011).|$|R
50|$|Her {{trial in}} 1663 {{was the first}} {{recorded}} appearance of Mary Carleton. She was charged for masquerading as a German princess and marrying John Carleton in London under that name. She claimed that John Carleton himself had {{claimed to be a}} lord and was trying to extract himself from marriage as he had discovered there was no money in it. Divorce would have been an <b>unheard</b> <b>of</b> scandal <b>in</b> those times. Both sides of the conflict published pamphlets to support their own story.

25|$|However, {{political}} {{discussion of}} the possibility of using a constitutional amendment to restrict marriage rights was not <b>unheard</b> <b>of</b> <b>in</b> the 1990s. In January 1996, for example, the House Judiciary Committee for the state of Hawaii voted 12-1 in favor of passing bill HB 117, which was aimed at amending the constitution of Hawaii to define marriage as involving one man and one woman. In 1998, the first anti-same-sex marriage amendment was added to the constitution of a U.S. state, though it was not until 2002 that a federal marriage amendment was first introduced in the U.S. Congress.|$|E
25|$|In 1949, Nakagawa {{made his}} first trip to the United States where he met Nyogen Senzaki in San Francisco.

Free to combine his love for Japanese theater (Noh) into analogies that paralleled sayings of the great Zen masters of the past. Nyogen expressed his wish to Soen that he would like him to stay with him to become his heir, but Soen has responsibilities back at Ryutaku-ji he was unwilling to compromise.

This {{was part of}} a record 109-match winning streak that the pair achieved between 1983 and 1985. (Navratilova was ranked the World No. 1 doubles player for a period of over three years in the 1980s.) From 1985 through 1987, Navratilova reached the women's singles final at all 11 major tournaments held during those three years, winning six of them. From 1982 through 1990, she reached the Wimbledon final nine consecutive times.

25|$|At any rate, the new heir-apparent {{turned out}} to be a tyrant. He {{immediately}} set out to tighten his grip on Lower Burma, branding men to facilitate identification, executing deserters, and forcing monks into the army. Thado Dhamma Yaza III, viceroy of Prome, openly disagreed with his brother's policies, and the two brothers got into a quarrel. Nanda was forced to intervene, officially releasing the conscripted men and seized property. But the damage was already done. Coercion proved self-defeating. With cultivators disappearing, rice prices in Lower Burma reached <b>unheard</b> <b>of</b> levels. <b>In</b> October 1594, the ruler of Moulmein (Mawlamyaing) revolted with Siamese support.|$|R

Although SOCs as they are commonly known, are ubiquitous now, the concept was almost <b>unheard</b> <b>of</b> back <b>in</b> the early 1980s. Two projects were started in around 1983, the M212 and the 'TV-toy'. The M212 was based on a standard T212 core {{with the addition of a}} disk controller for the ST 506 and ST 412 Shugart standards. 'TV-toy' was to be the basis for a games console and was joint project between Inmos and Sinclair Research.|$|R
