40|$|<b>A</b> <b>pump</b> {{station is}} <b>a</b> crucial flood control {{facility}} for mitigating inundation of urban lowland areas. Securing a site {{to increase the}} capacity <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pump</b> station or to maximize the discharge capacity of the <b>pump</b> sump in <b>an</b> urban area is difficult because of various limitations. Moreover, adding a facility to improve the <b>pump</b> capacity <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pump</b> station may affect flow characteristics, e. g., unexpected increases in flow velocity and vorticity, and cause severe problems in pump station operation. To solve those problems, anti-vortex devices (AVDs) have been developed and adopted according to the appropriate design standards.

In this study, flow in the sump was numerically simulated at various AVD heights to obtain data for improving the design and efficiency <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pump</b> station.
