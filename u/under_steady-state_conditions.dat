The steady-state approximation holds that the concentration of the catalyst-substrate complex is not changing over time; the total concentration of this complex remains low as it is whisked away almost immediately after formation. A steady-state rate law contains all of the rate constants and species required to go from starting material to product, while the denominator consists of a sum of terms describing the relative rates of the forward and reverse reactions consuming the steady-state intermediate.

50|$|Insofar as the {{tangential}} force {{is the one}} acting {{in the direction of}} travel, {{tangential force}} variation describes the change in this force as the tire rotates under load. As the tire rotates and spring elements with different spring constants enter and exit the contact area, the tangential force will change. As the tire rotates it exerts a high traction force to accelerate the vehicle and maintain its speed under constant velocity. <b>Under</b> <b>steady-state</b> <b>conditions</b> it would be typical for the force to vary up and down from this value. This variation would be characterized as TFV. In a constant velocity test condition, TFV would be manifested as a small speed fluctuation occurring every rotation due to the change in rolling radius of the tire. TFV is not measured in production testing.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, the Perozo group {{proposed}} a mechanistic {{explanation for the}} effects of voltage fields on KcsA gating. After adding a depolarizing current to the channel, the reorientation of Glu71 towards the intracellular pore occurs, thereby disrupting the Glu71-Asp80 carboxyl-carboxylate pair that initially stabilizes the selectivity filter. The collapse of the filter region prevents entry into or facilitate exit from the inactivated state. Glu71, {{a key part of the}} selectivity filter signature sequence that is conserved among K+ ion channels, plays a pivotal role in gating as its ability to reorient itself in the direction of the transmembrane voltage field is able to provide an explanation for voltage gating events in KcsA. The orientation of amino acids in the filter region might play significant physiological role in modulating potassium fluxes in eukaryotes and prokaryotes <b>under</b> <b>steady-state</b> <b>conditions.</b>|$|E

40|$|Isolated muscle {{cells from}} adult rat heart {{were used to}} study {{myocardial}} degradation of insulin and the reactions after the initial binding event. After 60 min of association at 37 degrees C, 90 % of specifically bound insulin could be dissociated from the cells; this fraction remained unaltered <b>under</b> <b>steady-state</b> <b>conditions</b> (up to 180 min). To assess the nature of cell-associated radioactivity, cardiocytes were solubilized and filtered on Sephadex G- 50. After 5 min of association only intact insulin was observed, whereas <b>under</b> <b>steady-state</b> <b>conditions</b> 4 % of 125 I-labelled insulin bound to the cells was degraded to iodotyrosine-containing fragments.

40|$|SummaryInteractions among {{suprachiasmatic nucleus}} (SCN) neurons are {{required}} for robust circadian rhythms entrained to local time. To investigate these signaling mechanisms, we developed a functional coupling assay that uniquely captures the dynamic process by which SCN neurons interact. As a population, SCN neurons typically display synchronized rhythms with similar peak times, but will peak 6 - 12  hr apart after in vivo exposure to long days. Once they are removed from these conditions, SCN neurons resynchronize through a phase-dependent coupling process mediated by both vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and GABAA signaling. Notably, GABAA signaling contributes to coupling when the SCN network is in an antiphase configuration, but opposes synchrony <b>under</b> <b>steady-state</b> <b>conditions.</b> Further, VIP acts together with GABAA signaling to couple the network in an antiphase configuration, but promotes synchrony <b>under</b> <b>steady-state</b> <b>conditions</b> by counteracting the actions of GABAA signaling.
