25|$|Binding {{affinity}} is {{most commonly}} determined using a radiolabeled ligand, {{known as a}} tagged ligand. Homologous competitive binding experiments involve binding competition between a tagged ligand and an <b>untagged</b> ligand.|$|E
25|$|A common {{technique}} involves engineering {{a sequence}} of 6 to 8 histidines into the N- or C-terminal of the protein. The polyhistidine binds strongly to divalent metal ions such as nickel and cobalt. The protein can be passed through a column containing immobilized nickel ions, which binds the polyhistidine tag. All <b>untagged</b> proteins pass through the column. The protein can be eluted with imidazole, which competes with the polyhistidine tag for binding to the column, or by a decrease in pH (typically to 4.5), which decreases the affinity of the tag for the resin. While this procedure is generally used for the purification of recombinant proteins with an engineered affinity tag (such as a 6xHis tag or Clontech's HAT tag), {{it can also be}} used for natural proteins with an inherent affinity for divalent cations.|$|E
500|$|For natural proteins, {{a series}} of {{purification}} steps {{may be necessary to}} obtain protein sufficiently pure for laboratory applications. To simplify this process, genetic engineering is often used to add chemical features to proteins that make them easier to purify without affecting their structure or activity. Here, a [...] "tag" [...] consisting of a specific amino acid sequence, often {{a series of}} histidine residues (a [...] "His-tag"), is attached to one terminus of the protein. As a result, when the lysate is passed over a chromatography column containing nickel, the histidine residues ligate the nickel and attach to the column while the <b>untagged</b> components of the lysate pass unimpeded. A number of different tags have been developed to help researchers purify specific proteins from complex mixtures.|$|E
50|$|In addition, in July 1989, the Administrator General {{was given}} {{three times as}} much airtime on SWABC TV as <b>UNTAG.</b> However, while the SWABC had offered <b>UNTAG</b> five minutes of radio airtime daily and ten-minute {{television}} slot in May 1989, <b>UNTAG</b> was unable to produce adequate broadcasts and failed to benefit from its allotted airtime until late June.|$|R
50|$|<b>UNTAG</b> {{was also}} charged with {{monitoring}} the SWAPO forces based in southern Angola and, despite numerous charges, {{mostly from the}} South Africans, that they were massing at the border or violating the border agreements, these allegations were denied by <b>UNTAG.</b>|$|R

2500|$|If [...] is continuous, {{then the}} lower and upper Darboux sums for an <b>untagged</b> {{partition}} are {{equal to the}} Riemann sum for that partition, where the tags are chosen to be the minimum or maximum (respectively) of [...] on each subinterval. (When [...] is discontinuous on a subinterval, {{there may not be}} a tag that achieves the infimum or supremum on that subinterval.) The Darboux integral, which is similar to the Riemann integral but based on Darboux sums, is equivalent to the Riemann integral.|$|E

5000|$|Notice {{that after}} the {{insertion}} of a [...]1Q header to an <b>untagged</b> frame, the frame's original ethertype {{appears to have been}} changed to 0x8100. The <b>untagged</b> frame's original ethertype in the single-tag frame is now located adjacent to the payload. Its value is unchanged.|$|E

5000|$|Tag {{protocol}} identifier (TPID): a 16-bit field set to {{a value of}} 0x8100 {{in order to identify}} the frame as an IEEE 802.1Q-tagged frame.

50|$|The primary {{advantage}} of a tagged union over an <b>untagged</b> union is that all accesses are safe, and the compiler can even check that all cases are handled. <b>Untagged</b> unions depend on program logic to correctly identify the currently active field, which may result in strange behavior and hard-to-find bugs if that logic fails.|$|E

50|$|<b>UNTAG</b> {{was also}} {{responsible}} for registering voters all over the vast and sparsely populated country. 70 registration centers were set up along with 110 mobile registration teams for the more remote areas.

Over 350 polling stations were set up across the country and personnel from the police, military, civilian elements of <b>UNTAG</b> were set on election monitoring duty, along with hundreds of extra election specialists contributed from more than 25 member states.|$|R

5000|$|This {{variation}} is called regressive {{due to the}} potentially exponential increase of tagged players. One person—the [...] "Manhunter"—is chosen to be [...] "it", and everyone else—"Fugitives"—runs away and hides. When a Fugitive is tagged, he or she becomes an additional Manhunter, or if the Fugitive get tagged a teammate who is <b>untagged</b> may tag them back in. The {{goal is to be}} caught last, to avoid being tagged until everyone else gives up, or optionally to stay <b>untagged</b> until a predetermined end time.|$|E

50|$|<b>UNTAG</b> was {{considered}} very successful by the UN and its member states. Namibia became a democracy, without the racial segregation seen under the apartheid system. The security problems had decreased during the <b>UNTAG</b> deployment and the elections {{had gone off}} better than expected. Despite tensions, after the elections, the Namibian and South African governments had established formal diplomatic relations. Furthermore, worries about costs were proven unfounded as <b>UNTAG</b> was well under the original budget of US$700 million, and even well under the reduced budget passed by the Security Council of US$416 million, costing less than US$368.6 million. There were 19 fatalities to UN personnel in just over a year.|$|R
50|$|In {{the months}} after the election, <b>UNTAG</b> forces were slowly drawn down and the final SADF forces were withdrawn.
