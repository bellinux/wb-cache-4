The purpose of this post-marketing study is to characterize <b>users</b> of <b>plant</b> stanol ester margarine with and without cardiovascular disease. Methods A cohort of plant stanol ester margarine users was established based on a compilation of 15 surveys conducted by the National Public Health Institute in Finland between 1996 – 2000. There were 29 772 subjects aged 35 – 84 years in the cohort. The <b>users</b> of <b>plant</b> stanol ester margarine were identified by the type of bread spread used. Results The plant stanol ester margarine was used as bread spread by 1332 (4. 5 %) subjects. Almost half (46 %) of the users reported a history of cardiovascular disease. Persons with cardiovascular disease were more likely to use plant stanol ester margarine (8 %) than persons without cardiovascular disease (3 %). Users with and without cardiovascular disease seemed to share similar characteristics. In particular, they were elderly people with otherwise healthy life-styles and diet. They were less likely smokers, more likely physically active and less likely obese than nonusers.

40|$|Abstract Objective: The aims of {{this study}} were to {{investigate}} the consistency of use of plant stanol ester margarine and to characterise consistent and inconsistent users. Design: A cohort of plant stanol ester margarine users was established based on 14 national surveys conducted by the National Public Health Institute in Finland between 1996 and 1999. A follow-up study questionnaire was developed and sent to 1294 users in 2000. Setting: Subjects who reported using plant stanol ester margarine in both the original survey and the follow-up study were classified as consistent users, and the rest as inconsistent users. Subjects: The study population consisted of 1094 subjects aged 18 - 87 years, 590 men and 504 women. Results: There were 357 (33 %) consistent and 737 (67 %) inconsistent <b>users</b> of <b>plant</b> stanol ester margarine in the study population.

The objective {{of this study is}} to compare medicinal plant use between two different ethnic college populations and explore differences between student medicinal <b>plant</b> <b>users</b> and non-users for comparison with previous research. Methods: Students (n = 721) at a large research university (n = 498) and a Pan-Tribal University for Native Americans (n = 233) completed surveys in October 2011 to assess past year medicinal plant use. The Mann-Whitney U test, Chi Square test, and General Linear Model were used to compare demographics and self-reported use of medicinal plants among students at both Universities and between past year users and non-users.

30|$|Region of {{interest}} (ROI) {{plays an important}} role in medical image analysis. In this paper, a new approach to ROI extraction based on the curve evolution is proposed. Different from the existent method, the proposed approach is efficient both in segmentation results and computational cost. The deforming curve is modeled as a monotonically marching front under a positive speed field, where a region speed function is derived by minimizing the new defined ROI energy, and integrated with the edge-based speed function. The curve evolution model integrating the ROI information has a large propagation range and could even drive the front in low-contrast and narrow thin areas. Moreover, a multi-initial fast marching algorithm, which permits the <b>user</b> to <b>plant</b> several seed curves as the initial front and evolves them simultaneously, is developed to fast implement the numerical solution. Selective planting seed curves could help the local growth and thus may further improve the segmentation results and reduce the computational cost.
