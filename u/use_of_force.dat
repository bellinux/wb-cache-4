5|$|In 1978, when Vietnamese leaders {{launched}} their invasion of Kampuchea {{to remove the}} Khmer Rouge regime, they did not expect a negative reaction from the international community. However, the events that followed the invasion showed that Vietnamese leaders had severely miscalculated international sympathies towards their cause. Instead of backing Vietnam, most United Nations member countries denounced the Vietnamese <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> against Kampuchea, and even moved to revive the battered Khmer Rouge organisation that had once governed the country with such brutality. Thus, {{more than just a}} military problem, Kampuchea quickly evolved into an economic and diplomatic problem for Vietnam on the international arena. Throughout the decade in which Vietnam occupied neighbouring Kampuchea, the Vietnamese Government, and the PRK regime which it installed, were placed {{on the periphery of the}} international community.|$|E

5|$|After the Six-Day War in 1967, the PLO {{moved their}} bases to Jordan and stepped up their guerrilla attacks against Israel, taking the border town of Karameh as their headquarters. The IDF {{claimed that the}} purpose was to destroy the PLO militant camps at Karameh and capture Yasser Arafat as reprisal, however, it is also {{believed}} that it wanted to punish Jordan for its perceived support to Palestinian fighters (fedayeen, meaning self-sacrificers). Israel assumed the Jordanian Army would choose to not get involved in the battle, but the latter deployed heavy artillery fire. The Israelis withdrew, or were repulsed, after a day-long battle, having destroyed most of the Karameh camp and taken around 140 PLO members prisoner. The battle resulted in the issuance of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 248, which unanimously condemned Israel for violating the cease-fire line and its disproportionate <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>force.</b>|$|E

In response, the UN Credentials Committee decided to recognise Democratic Kampuchea by a vote of six to three, despite the Khmer Rouge's blood-stained record while in power. Accordingly, {{representatives of}} Democratic Kampuchea were allowed to be seated in the General Assembly, with strong support from China. By January 1980, 29 countries had established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of Kampuchea, yet nearly 80 countries still recognised the legitimacy of the deposed Democratic Kampuchea.

5|$|In March 1933, {{less than}} three months after the Nazis seized power, Himmler set up the first {{official}} concentration camp at Dachau. Hitler had stated {{that he did not want}} it to be just another prison or detention camp. Himmler appointed Theodor Eicke, a convicted felon and ardent Nazi, to run the camp in June 1933. Eicke devised a system that was used as a model for future camps throughout Germany. Its features included isolation of victims from the outside world, elaborate roll calls and work details, the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> and executions to exact obedience, and a strict disciplinary code for the guards. Uniforms were issued for prisoners and guards alike; the guards' uniforms had a special Totenkopf (death's head) insignia on their collars. By the end of 1934, Himmler took control of the camps under the aegis of the SS, creating a separate division, the SS-Totenkopfverbände.|$|E
5|$|Arrangements devised in 1963 between 'Aflaq and the Military Committee {{led to a}} {{very close}} mutual {{involvement}} {{of the military and}} civilian sectors of the regime, so {{that by the end of}} 1965 the politics of the Syrian army had become almost identical to the politics of the Ba'th Party. The principle military protagonist of the period Hafiz, J'did, and 'Umran were no longer on military service and their power depended on their intermediary supporters in the army and in the party. In November 1965, the National Command issued a resolution which stated it was forbidden for the Regional Command to transfer or dismiss military officers without the consent of the National Command. After hearing of the resolution, Jadid rebelled immediately, and ordered Colonel Mustafa Tlas to arrest the commanders of the Homs garrison and his deputy, both supporters of National Command. In response, Razzaz called for an emergency session of the National Command which decreed the Regional Command dissolved, and made Bitar Prime Minister. Hafiz was made Chairman of a new Presidential Council and Shibli al-Aysami his deputy. Umran was recalled from exile and reappointed to the office of Minister of Defence and commander-in-chief, and Mansur al-Atrash was appointed Chairman of a new and expanded National Revolutionary Council. Jadid and his supporters responded by making war on the National Command. Assad, who neither liked nor had sympathy for the Aflaqites, did not support a showdown through the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>force.</b> In response to the coming coup, Assad, along with Naji Jamil, Husayn Mulhim and Yusuf Sayigh, left for London.|$|E

This study is intended to help Turkish National Police administrators to understand and prevent police <b>use</b> <b>of</b> excessive <b>force.</b> Studies on police brutality categorize three factors that explain why police officers use excessive force; these are individual, situational and organizational. In addition to brutality theories, job satisfaction literature is {{examined in this study}} to understand the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> excessive <b>force.</b> Job satisfaction is found to be related with burnout, turnover, stress, commitment, and performance. The impact of officers' attitude toward the criminal justice system and/or laws has not been tested widely. Police officers attitudes toward human rights laws are examined in this study to measure its impact on attitude toward <b>use</b> <b>of</b> excessive <b>force.</b> A secondary data collected in Turkey are analyzed by structural equation modeling which provides confirmatory factor analysis, path analysis, and causal relationships between variables. It is found that police officers' attitude toward human rights laws is a significant predictor of their attitudes toward <b>use</b> <b>of</b> excessive <b>force.</b> Job satisfaction and education level are the other significant variables affecting attitude toward <b>use</b> <b>of</b> excessive <b>force.</b> Based on the analyses of findings, educational and policy implications are posed for Turkish police administrators to better understand and prevent police <b>use</b> <b>of</b> excessive <b>force...</b>|$|R
