40|$|Teams {{have become}} the norm for {{operating}} in dangerous and complex situations. To investigate how physical threat affects team performance, 27 threeperson teams engaged in a complex planning and problem-solving task, either <b>under</b> <b>physical</b> <b>threat</b> or under normal conditions. Threat consisted {{of the possibility that}} during task performance the oxygen level would be reduced (which, in reality, did not occur). Team processes were measured by automated behavior recordings and questionnaires. Results confirmed that physical threat caused restrictions in information processing, more controlling leadership, less group discussions, and a reduction in coordinating and supporting behavior. These results support the propositions of the threat-rigidity thesis and extend previous research by establishing these results for physical threat and demonstrating effects on coordinating and supporting behavior as well...|$|E
40|$|Trust {{in remote}} {{interaction}} {{is a fundamental}} challenge in distributed computing environments. To obtain a remote party's trust, computing systems {{must be able to}} guarantee the privacy of intellectual property and the integrity of program execution. Unfortunately, traditional platforms cannot provide such guarantees <b>under</b> <b>physical</b> <b>threats</b> that exist in distributed environments. The AEGIS secure processor enables a physically secure computing platform to be built with a main processor as the only trusted hardware component. AEGIS empowers a remote party to authenticate the platform and guarantees secure execution even <b>under</b> <b>physical</b> <b>threats.</b> To realize the security features of AEGIS with only a single chip, this thesis presents a secure processor architecture along with its enabling security mechanisms. The architecture suggests a technique called suspended secure processing to allow a secure part of an application to be protected separately from the rest. Physical random functions provide a cheap and secure way of generating a unique secret key on each processor, which enables a remote party to authenticate the processor chip. (cont.) Memory encryption and integrity verification mechanisms guarantee the privacy and the integrity of off-chip memory content, respectively. A fully-functional RTL implementation and simulation studies demonstrate that the overheads associated with this single-chip approach is reasonable. The security components in AEGIS consumes about 230 K logic gates. AEGIS, with its off-chip protection mechanisms, is slower than traditional processors by 26 % on average for large applications and by a few percent for embedded applications. This thesis also shows that using AEGIS requires only minor modifications to traditional operating systems and compilers. by Gookwon Edward Suh. Thesis (Ph. D.)

The {{main purpose}} of the present study was to {{investigate}} the effects of ego <b>threat,</b> <b>physical</b> <b>threat,</b> and the combination of ego and <b>physical</b> <b>threat</b> on state anxiety (A-State) arousal for persons who differ in trait anxiety (A-Trait). Subjects were categorized as low or high A-Trait on the basis of extreme scores on the State-Trait, Anxiety Inventory - Trait Scale. The measure of A-State was the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - State Scale. Differential instructions were used to produce ego <b>threat,</b> <b>physical</b> <b>threat,</b> ego-physical threat and no threat (Control) conditions. - The experimental procedure consisted of a Rest Period, a Performance Period in which a memory task was administered, a Feedback Period, a Test Period in which the memory task was readministered and a second Feedback Period. Upon completion of the Performance Period, subjects were randomly assigned to the experimental conditions. A-State measures were obtained after the Rest Period and the second Feedback Period. - On the basis of Spielberger's (1972 b) Trait State Anxiety Theory, it was hypothesized that high and low A-Trait subjects would manifest increases in A-State in response to the ego and <b>physical</b> <b>threats.</b> It was also expected that in-creases in A-State as a function of ego threat would be greater for high A-Trait than low A-Trait individuals, but no differentiation as a function of <b>physical</b> <b>threat</b> would occur. [...] In all experimental conditions, scores increased from the Rest to the Test Period. These increases were significantly greater in the ego and <b>physical</b> <b>threat</b> inducing conditions than in the no threat (Control) condition. [...] Expectations that High and Low A-Trait subjects would manifest differential responses in A-State as a function of ego <b>threat</b> but not <b>physical</b> <b>threat</b> were only partly met. While High A-Trait subjects responded with significantly greater increases in A-State in all conditions having a direct ego threat arising from failure feedback, in the one condition which consisted of anticipation or potential for ego threat (shame) tied to the <b>physical</b> <b>threat,</b> there was no significant difference between the groups in A-State response. Also, unexpectedly, differential A-State responses for the High and Low A-Trait subjects were found in the condition consisting of only <b>physical</b> <b>threat.</b> [...] Several explanations for the results of the present study were suggested and recommendations for future research were made...|$|R

40|$|Threatening stimuli {{are thought}} to bias spatial {{attention}} toward the location from which the threat is presented. Although this effect is well-established in the visual domain, little is known regarding whether tactile attention is similarly affected by threatening pictures. We hypothesised that tactile attention might be more affected by cues implying <b>physical</b> <b>threat</b> to a person's bodily tissues than by cues implying general threat. In the present study, participants made temporal order judgments (TOJs) concerning which {{of a pair of}} tactile (or auditory) stimuli, one presented to either hand, at a range of inter-stimulus intervals, had been presented first. A picture (showing <b>physical</b> <b>threat,</b> general threat, or no threat) was presented in front of one or the other hand shortly before the tactile stimuli. The results revealed that tactile attention was biased toward the side on which the picture was presented, and that this effect was significantly larger for <b>physical</b> <b>threat</b> pictures than for general threat or neutral pictures. By contrast, the bias in auditory attention toward the side of the picture was significantly larger for general threat pictures than for <b>physical</b> <b>threat</b> pictures or neutral pictures. These findings therefore demonstrate a modality-specific effect of physically threatening cues on the processing of tactile stimuli, and of generally threatening cues on auditory information processing. These results demonstrate that the processing of tactile information from the body part closest to the threatening stimulus is prioritized over tactile information from elsewhere on the body...|$|R

The aim of this thesis was to identify the specific components of threat potential related to the FWHR.

The FWHR correlated positively with aspects of <b>physical</b> <b>threat</b> potential in men and women, and an aspect of psychological threat potential in men. Additionally, study 1 investigated {{the extent to which}} these types of threat potential differentially predict aggression. In men only, psychological threat potential predicted non-costly aggression, and <b>physical</b> <b>threat</b> potential predicted costly aggression. In study 2, participants made inferences about the threat potential of participants from study 1. Results demonstrated an ability to infer threat potential from the face, and sex differences related to the definition of aggressiveness. Together, these findings demonstrate that the FWHR conveys two forms of threat potential in men, which differentially predict aggression...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates {{voluntary}} HIV testing behaviour {{among young}} adults in two Cape Town townships. Despite exceptionally high HIV prevalence rates, South Africa experiences {{low rates of}} HIV testing. Low levels of testing are worrisome because knowledge of HIV status {{is thought to be}} a key element in both the prevention of HIV transmission and the provision of care and treatment for those who are infected. Through qualitative in-depth interviews with 15 young adults (9 female, 6 male), this study found that choices regarding the voluntary uptake of HIV testing were strongly linked to the perceived implications of the HIV test. An analysis of the findings illustrates that study participants perceived HIV positive people to experience a number of threats because of their status – namely <b>physical</b> <b>threats,</b> social threats, and psychological threats – and that HIV testing served to either mitigate or expose an individual to these <b>threats.</b> <b>Physical</b> <b>threats</b> posed by HIV, such as opportunistic infections or death, encouraged HIV testing because it was only through testing that these potential threats could be mitigated. Conversely, an HIV test exposed an individual to social threats, such as ostracism and shame, and psychological threats, such as depression and self-rejection. Where social and psychological threats were perceived to be strong, testing was actively avoided. The findings of this study are that the decision to voluntarily test for HIV can be explained through a balance of the physical, social, and psychological threats that one can mitigate or be exposed to through testing for HIV. Using a threat-balance model, the analysis of findings shows that when study participants perceived <b>physical</b> <b>threats</b> to outweigh perceived social and psychological threats of living with HIV, they were biased towards testing. When they viewed social and psychological <b>threats</b> to outweigh <b>physical</b> <b>threats,</b> they were biased against testing. The focus on perceived threats of living with HIV highlights the need to focus on the social and psychological aspects of HIV/AIDS disease and illness, and not simply the clinical diagnosis and treatment of symptoms, both of which focus on <b>physical</b> <b>threats.</b> Because enhanced infrastructural resources for HIV testing and the availability of ARVs for mitigation of the <b>physical</b> <b>threats</b> alone do not encourage HIV testing, a 2 comprehensive plan to increase HIV testing must also seek to reduce the social and psychological threats presented by HIV infection...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{researchers}} {{have suggested that}} cognitive avoidance occurs for stimuli describing social threats but not for stimuli describing <b>physical</b> <b>threats.</b> The present research examined whether individuals can cognitively avoid physically threatening stimuli, such as the words 'HIV' or 'cancer'. Three studies investigated (a) personality characteristics that predict cognitive avoidance of physically threatening stimuli, (b) whether the stimuli have to be relevant to the avoider and (c) circumstances that may disrupt the avoidance mechanism. Study 1 was an exploratory study examining the personality characteristics that predict avoidance of thoughts concerning <b>physical</b> <b>threats,</b> specifically, sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The study found that lower sexual self-efficacy and less assertiveness predicted greater self-reported avoidance of thoughts concerning STIs. The more participants tended to avoid thoughts concerning STIs the less likely they were to discuss safer sex practices with their partner and the less consistent {{they were in their}} condom use. The findings suggest that individuals can avoid thoughts of <b>physical</b> <b>threats</b> (i. e., STIs) and that this avoidance can have consequences such as engaging in riskier sexual behaviours (i. e., not consistently using condoms). In study 2, participants were presented threatening words on a computerized task (the emotional Stroop task) to assess if they would automatically attend to or avoid physically threatening words. Dispositionally avoidant participants (participants low in anxiety and high in repressive defensiveness) avoided physically threatening words but only if they were perceived to be self-relevant, otherwise the avoidance mechanism was not elicited. Study 3 examined if the avoidance of <b>physical</b> <b>threats</b> may be disrupted when there is a temporary reduction in dopamine, such as when cigarette smokers abstain from smoking. Results showed that non-abstaining smokers with an avoidant disposition superficially processed (avoided) threatening words related to smoking on an emotional Stroop task. Abstainers however did not demonstrate this superficial processing suggesting that the avoidance mechanism was disrupted. The three studies demonstrate that individuals avoid <b>physical</b> <b>threats</b> if they perceive them to be self-relevant and that this avoidance mechanism can be disrupted by a temporary reduction in dopamine...|$|R
