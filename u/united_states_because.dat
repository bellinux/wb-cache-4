5|$|According to CP+B {{employee}} Tom Zukoszki, {{the fictional}} background {{information for the}} band was that they signed with Burger King instead of a major record label. As part of the promotion, a four-song LP record was recorded, two music videos produced, and a national (US) tour planned. The tour had to be cancelled because the actor playing the lead singer, a Canadian citizen, was unable to enter the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>because</b> he had a criminal record in his home country.|$|E
5|$|The Medal of Honor {{was created}} during the American Civil War {{and is the}} highest {{military}} decoration presented by the United States government {{to a member of}} its armed forces.

5|$|As a scientist, Oppenheimer {{is remembered}} by his {{students}} and colleagues {{as being a}} brilliant researcher and engaging teacher who was the founder of modern theoretical physics in the <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> <b>Because</b> his scientific attentions often changed rapidly, he never worked long enough on any one topic and carried it to fruition to merit the Nobel Prize, although his investigations contributing {{to the theory of}} black holes may have warranted the prize had he lived long enough to see them brought into fruition by later astrophysicists. An asteroid, 67085 Oppenheimer, was named in his honor, as was the lunar crater Oppenheimer.|$|E
5|$|Haylage, {{also known}} as Round bale silage is a term for grass sealed in {{airtight}} plastic bags, a form of forage that is frequently fed in the United Kingdom and continental Europe, but is not often seen in the <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> <b>Because</b> haylage {{is a type of}} silage, hay stored in this fashion must remain completely sealed in plastic, as any holes or tears can stop the preservation properties of fermentation and lead to mold or spoilage. Rodents chewing through the plastic can also spoil the hay introducing contamination to the bale. If a rodent dies inside the plastic, the subsequent botulism toxins released can contaminate the entire bale.|$|E
5|$|In 1887, Tesla {{developed}} an induction motor that ran on alternating current, a power system format that was rapidly expanding in Europe and the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>because</b> of its advantages in long-distance, high-voltage transmission. The motor used polyphase current, which generated a {{rotating magnetic field}} to turn the motor (a principle that Tesla claimed to have conceived in 1882). This innovative electric motor, patented in May 1888, was a simple self-starting design that did not need a commutator, thus avoiding sparking and the high maintenance of constantly servicing and replacing mechanical brushes.|$|E

5|$|On September 22, 2017, Chelsea Manning {{was denied}} entry to Canada from the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>because</b> of her {{criminal}} record. According {{to a letter}} from Canadian immigration officials, posted online by Manning, she is inadmissible due to being convicted of offenses equivalent to treason in Canada. Manning told Reuters that she had planned to vacation in Montreal and Vancouver, but was stopped at a Quebec border crossing by the Canada Border Services Agency {{on the evening of}} September 21 and detained overnight. She said she would retain a Canadian lawyer to challenge the inadmissibility finding before a Canadian tribunal.|$|E
5|$|Squall lines, or solid {{bands of}} strong thunderstorms, can form ahead of cold fronts and lee troughs {{due to the}} {{presence}} of significant atmospheric moisture and strong upper level divergence, leading to hail and high winds. When significant directional wind shear exists in the atmosphere ahead of a cold front {{in the presence of a}} strong upper level jet stream, tornado formation is possible. Although tornadoes can form anywhere on Earth, the greatest number occur in the Great Plains in the <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> <b>because</b> downsloped winds off the north-south oriented Rocky Mountains, which can form a dryline, aid their development at any strength.|$|E
5|$|The Last Of The Masters is in {{the public}} domain in the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>because</b> it was {{published}} in the United States between January 1, 1950 and December 31, 1963, but copyright was not renewed with the U.S. Copyright Office within a year period beginning on December 31 of the 27th year of the copyright and running through December 31 of the following year.

5|$|HIStory debuted {{at number}} one on the Billboard 200 and Top R/Hip-Hop Albums charts selling over 391,000 copies in its first week. The album was {{certified}} seven times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on October 22, 1999 in the <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> <b>Because</b> HIStory is double disc album, its CDs are therefore counted separately for certification purposes, meaning the album achieved platinum status in the United States after 500,000 copies were shipped, not one million. In Europe, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry certified HIStory six times platinum, denoting six million shipments within the continent, including 1.5 million in Germany and 1.2 million shipments in the United Kingdom. As of 2010, HIStory has sold more than 20 million copies worldwide and is the best selling multiple-disc release, {{making it one of the}} best-selling albums of all time.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} Bartolomé Mitre {{stated that}} Manuel Belgrano held a deep admiration for George Washington, {{leader of the}} American Revolution and first President of the <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> <b>Because</b> of this, he worked on a translation of George Washington's Farewell Address into the Spanish language. He started working on it during the Paraguay Campaign, but before the battle of Tacuarí he destroyed all his papers, including the unfinished translation, {{to prevent them from}} falling into enemy hands. Belgrano resumed work on it afterwards and finished it before the Battle of Salta. He sent it to Buenos Aires for publication. George Washington's Farewell Address is considered, along with Gettysburg Address, {{one of the most important}} texts in the history of the United States. It talks about the importance of keeping national unity as the key to maintain independence, prosperity, and freedom—ideas that were shared by Belgrano regarding the population of Hispanic America.|$|E
5|$|Many {{circumstances}} surrounding the film—including its unusual budget, length, and production time, {{as well as its}} similarities to the 1901 New York attraction—indicate that Méliès was especially keen to release the film in the <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> <b>Because</b> of rampant film piracy, Méliès never received most of the profits of the popular film. One account reports that Méliès sold a print of the film to the Paris photographer Charles Gerschel for use in an Algiers theatre, under strict stipulation that the print only be shown in Algeria. Gerschel sold the print, and various other Méliès films, to the Edison Manufacturing Company employee Alfred C. Abadie, who sent them directly to Edison's laboratories to be duplicated and sold by Vitagraph. Copies of the print spread to other firms, and by 1904 Siegmund Lubin, the Selig Polyscope Company, and Edison were all redistributing it. Edison's print of the film was even offered in a hand-colored version available at a higher price, just as Méliès had done. Méliès was often uncredited altogether; {{for the first six months}} of the film's distribution, the only American exhibitor to credit Méliès in advertisements for the film was Thomas Lincoln Tally, who chose the film as the inaugural presentation of his Electric Theater.|$|E
