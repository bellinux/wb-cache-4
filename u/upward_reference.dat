40|$|We {{demonstrate}} precise {{closed-loop control}} of microjets {{under the influence}} of the magnetic fields in three-dimensional (3 D) space. For this purpose, we design a magnetic-based control system that directs the field lines towards reference positions. Microjets align along the controlled field lines using the magnetic torque exerted on their magnetic dipole, and move towards the reference positions using their self-propulsion force. We demonstrate the controlled motion of microjets in 3 D space, and show that their propulsion force allows them to overcome vertical forces, such as buoyancy forces, interaction forces with oxygen bubbles, and vertical flow. The closed-loop control localizes the microjets within a spherical region of convergence with an average diameter of 406 +/- 220 lm, whereas the self-propulsion force allows them to swim at an average speed of 222674 lm/s within the horizontal plane. Furthermore, we observe that the controlled microjets dive downward and swim <b>upward</b> towards <b>reference</b> positions at average speeds of 232 +/- 40 lm/s and 316 +/- 81 lm/s, respectively...|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} flow in a viscous fluid {{generated by a}} source pulsating sinusoidally and moving with constant horizontal velocity is considered {{within the framework of}} linear Oseen equations. The combined effect of fluid viscosity and surface tension on the potential function below the water surface is studied. It is shown that the wave form of oscillations is largely modified by the surface tension while the wave amplitude of most short waves is attenuated by the fluid viscosity. Unlike pure-gravity waves, the non-physical properties of high oscillations and strong singularities revealed in Chen & Wu (2001) disappear in the fundamental solution of time-harmonic ship waves with the effect of surface tension and fluid viscosity. 1. Time-harmonic Oseen equations We consider the lower half-space filled with water limited on the top by the water-air interface. A Cartesian coordinate system is defined by placing the (x, y) -plane coincided with the undisturbed free surface and the z-axis oriented positively <b>upward.</b> This <b>reference</b> system is moving at the mean forward speed U along the positive x-direction same as that of the source which is pulsating harmonically at a frequency denoted by ω. In this gravity-dominant fluid domain, the reference length L, the acceleration of gravity g and the water density ρ are used to define the nondimensional coordinates (x, y, z), the time t, the fluid velocity u = (u, v, w), the velocity potential Φ and the dynamic pressure P with respect to (L, g/L, gL, gL 3, ρgL), respectively, while the nondimensional frequency f, the Froude number F and the Brard number τ by (f, F, τ) = (...|$|R
5000|$|The {{reason for}} the {{appearance}} of a gravitational offset is Einstein's equivalence principle, which states that the effects of gravity on an object are indistinguishable from acceleration. When held fixed in a gravitational field by, for example, applying a ground reaction force or an equivalent <b>upward</b> thrust, the <b>reference</b> frame for an accelerometer (its own casing) accelerates upwards with respect to a free-falling reference frame. The effects of this acceleration are indistinguishable from any other acceleration experienced by the instrument, so that an accelerometer cannot detect the difference between sitting in a rocket on the launch pad, and being in the same rocket in deep space while it uses its engines to accelerate at 1 g. For similar reasons, an accelerometer will read zero during any type of free fall. This includes use in a coasting spaceship in deep space far from any mass, a spaceship orbiting the Earth, an airplane in a parabolic [...] "zero-g" [...] arc, or any free-fall in vacuum. Another example is free-fall at a sufficiently high altitude that atmospheric effects can be neglected.|$|R
