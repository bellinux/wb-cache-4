50|$|Electrohydraulic forming (EHF) {{is based}} on the <b>ultra-high-speed</b> {{deformation}} of metal using shockwaves in water. Via the discharge of current from a Bmax system, an electric arc is generated in water between two electrodes. This electric arc vaporizes the surrounding water, converting electrical energy into an intense shockwave of mechanical energy. The shockwave simultaneously transforms the metal workpiece into a visco-plastic state and accelerates it onto a die, enabling forming of complex shapes at high speeds in cold conditions. All of which happens in a matter of milliseconds; total cycle time of seconds including charging time of the system. This process is not limited by size and allows forming of parts up to a few square meters in size. An array of electrodes can be placed over a large workpiece, enabling pressure distribution according to the product’s topology, still using a one-sided die to create complex shapes and fine details.|$|E
