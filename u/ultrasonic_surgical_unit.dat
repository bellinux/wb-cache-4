40|$|Abstract The thesis {{focuses on}} the {{application}} of disinfection and sterilization in the <b>surgical</b> <b>unit.</b> These methods {{are an integral part}} of nursing care and they prevent creation, transmission and spread of infection. The qualitative research was carried out in the surgical department in the Hospital Prachatice a. s [...] The method used in the research is an unstandardized in-depth interview, in the second phase extended to a structured observation. There were set three objectives. Objective 1 : to determine the ways of application of disinfection in the <b>surgical</b> <b>unit,</b> Objective 2 : to determine the ways of application of sterilization in the <b>surgical</b> <b>unit,</b> Objective 3 : to determine whether nurses observe the principles of disinfection and sterilization in the <b>surgical</b> <b>unit.</b> On the basis of these objectives, there were formed three research questions: What types of applications are used for disinfection in the <b>surgical</b> <b>unit?</b> What types of sterilization applications are used in the <b>surgical</b> <b>unit?</b> What principles of disinfection and sterilization are observed in the <b>surgical</b> <b>unit?</b> From the results of the in-depth interview and observation, it was discovered that physical and chemical disinfection is applied in the <b>surgical</b> <b>unit.</b> The employees use the services of central sterilization. In the <b>surgical</b> <b>unit,</b> there is not used any type of sterilization, except of the pre-sterilisation preparation. While disinfection, the employees follow the correct procedure, but they do not always use the correct amount of disinfectant. As the possibility of improvement, I would suggest to carry out training and remind that the recommended concentrations of disinfectants are sufficiently effective. There is no need to increase their amount hence it increases the financial costs of the <b>surgical</b> <b>unit...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Genomic tumor information, such as {{identification}} of amplified oncogenes, {{can be used}} to plan treatment. The two sources of a brain tumor that are commonly available include formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections from the small diagnostic biopsy and the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>surgical</b> aspiration that contains the bulk of the tumor. In research centers, frozen tissue of a brain tumor may also be available. This study compared <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>surgical</b> aspiration and FFPE specimens from the same brain tumors for retrieval of DNA and molecular assessment of amplified oncogenes. Methods Surgical aspirations were centrifuged to separate erythrocytes from the tumor cells that predominantly formed large, overlying buffy coats. These were sampled to harvest nuclear pellets for DNA purification. Four glioblastomas, 2 lung carcinoma metastases, and an ependymoma were tested. An inexpensive PCR technique, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), quantified 79 oncogenes using 3 kits. Copy number (CN) results were normalized to DNA from non-neoplastic brain (NB) in calculated ratios, [tumor DNA]/[NB DNA]. Bland-Altman and Spearman rank correlative comparisons were determined. Regression analysis identified outliers. Results Purification of DNA from <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>surgical</b> aspirations was rapid (Conclusions Buffy coats of centrifuged ultrasonic aspirations contained abundant tumor cells whose DNA permitted rapid, multiplex detection of high-level oncogene amplifications that were confirmed in FFPE.

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} effects of excursion, frequency, and application force on the cutting rate of an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>surgical</b> instrument. Devices such as the Harmonic Scalpel, (an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>surgical</b> instrument from Ethicon Endo-Surgery Inc. (EES) Cincinnati, OH), are gaining popularity {{in the operating room}} because of: the control given to the surgeon, reduced tissue damage, decreased operating times, and more rapid healing. The Harmonic Scalpel system consists of a current generator, a hand piece that houses an ultrasonic transducer, and an instrument having an end-effector used to cut tissue. It is a resonant device that operates at a frequency of 55. 5 kHz. Surgeons control the Harmonic Scalpel’s coagulation rate and cutting speed by the time and force applied to the tissue by the end-effector, and by the selected excursion level of the end-effector. Little {{attention has been paid to}} {{the effects of}} ultrasonic frequency on cut-rate, and the results from the few published articles found in pertinent literature are inconclusive...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{study is}} {{presented}} of a miniature <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>surgical</b> drill designed for bone biopsy, {{based on an}} ultrasonic/sonic drill which converts high frequency to low frequency vibrations through a freely vibrating mass between an ultrasonic transducer-horn and a drill bit. For conventional surgical drilling using a rotary drill or an ultrasonic drill, considerable power is required to penetrate into bone and the efficiency is low. However, for ultrasonic/sonic drilling, sufficient acoustic energy is accumulated and then released through each impact to achieve precise drilling with a lower power requirement. The ultrasonic/sonic drill was originally invented for rock drilling in low gravity environments. In this study it is incorporated in a miniature <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>surgical</b> drill and the effective impulse delivered to the bone is {{used to evaluate the}} drilling performance. To develop a miniature surgical device based on maximising the effective impulse, optimisation of the ultrasonic horn and free-mass is first demonstrated. The shape and dimensions of the ultrasonic horn and free-mass are determined through FEA, which focuses on maximising the post-collision velocity of the free-mass. Then, the entire dynamic stack constituting the surgical drill device is modelled as a mass-spring-damper system to analyse the dynamic behaviour. The numerical model is validated through experiments, using a prototype drill, which record the velocity of the free-mass and the drilling force. The results of the numerical models and experiments indicate this miniature <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>surgical</b> drill can deliver sufficient impulse to penetrate bone and form the basis of an ultrasonically activated bone biopsy device...|$|R

40|$|Between January 1984 and December 1990, 65 {{intramedullary}} {{spinal cord}} tumors were diagnosed and operated on. In this series, all patients underwent {{magnetic resonance imaging}} investigations and were operated on with the Cavitron <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>surgical</b> aspirator whenever necessary. Major surgical difficulties {{have been found in}} patients previously treated by radiotherapy with or without biopsy. We found magnetic resonance imaging to be a highly sensitive imaging procedure and the method of choice for visualizing tumors within the spinal cord. Nevertheless, accurate diagnosis may only be suggested by magnetic resonance imaging, rather than made definitively. Surgery is necessary in every case in order to obtain a definite diagnosis. Radical surgery can be performed when a plane exists between the tumor and the normal spinal cord: biopsy or debulking with the Cavitron <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>surgical</b> aspirator should be performed when the tumor is infiltrative. We have performed 33 so-called total resections, 22 partial resections, and 10 biopsies, among which 5 were performed on lipomas.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of the cancellous bone surrogate material, rigid {{polyurethane foam}} (PUF), subject to power ultrasonic vibration excitation has been studied, {{with the purpose}} of identifying a methodology to investigate the effects that <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>surgical</b> devices have on biological tissue materials. To characterise the vibrational response to ultrasonic excitation, non-contact measurement of the full in-plane displacement field of PUF plate specimens was performed by combining the use of an ultra-high speed camera and 2 D digital image correlation. To investigate the thermal response, an infrared camera was used in real time to detect the temperature field. The measured surface displacement and strain fields of the PUF specimens and the thermal response are compared with data from an analytical model, and two different finite element models using ABAQUS and PZFLEX. The close agreement between calculated and measured data provides initial confidence {{in the use of the}} models for predicting the effects of ultrasonic excitation on tissue materials. The measurement data demonstrate the success of the experimental method for measuring vibrational responses in a hard tissue surrogate material at the ultrasonic frequencies associated with power <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>surgical</b> devices...|$|R
