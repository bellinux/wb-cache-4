5|$|Deep Purple was {{practically}} {{ignored by the}} music press in the US upon its release in June 1969 and bounced <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the Billboard 200 chart for a few weeks, peaking at No. 162 and not coming close {{to the success of}} its two predecessors. Tetragrammaton's financial problems were partially to blame, as promotion was lackluster, but the lack of a hit single to be aired on FM radio or a tour in support of the album were also important factors.|$|E
5|$|Jaffe {{noted that}} the low-tech method of {{suspending}} actors by wires helped the final effect, because as photographed by John Fante, few wires {{had to be removed}} digitally in post-production; sets were constructed so that the harsh lighting obscured wires, and entire sets were constructed on their sides so that by pulling actors <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the rotated sets, the characters appeared to float sideways. These sets were on gimbals so that the movement of the actors and sets created a floating effect. The shot of two Klingons killed and thrown back down a corridor by phaser blasts was simulated by positioning the camera {{at the bottom of a}} corridor set. The set was placed on its end in the tallest soundstage at Paramount, so that the camera looked up towards the ceiling. In this position, the wires were hidden by the actors as they ascended the corridor.|$|E

The show also believes that cheerleading is tough. The show takes place in Lexington, Kentucky.|$|R
25|$|Fancher {{states that}} radical hermeneutics, {{which is similar}} to but {{different}} from ontological hermeneutics, may end up being a kind of Trojan horse for psychotherapy because its emphasis on subjective narrative and deconstruction can lend itself to a dangerous relativism. He likens it to a small boy jumping <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the diving board of an empty pool: what starts out in innocence is likely to end up in disaster.|$|E
25|$|Star Wars: Masters of Teräs Käsi is a {{fighting}} {{game with a}} 3D gameplay element. The player is able to move their character not only forwards and back using the left and right, but can sidestep by using the <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the controller. There are three ways to achieve a win: knocking out the opponent, forcing the opponent out of the ring, or having the most health when time runs out. Rounds are timed, and the player must win two of three rounds to be declared {{the winner of the}} match.|$|E
25|$|Vibrato {{can also}} be used for a fast trill. A trill {{initiated}} from just hammering the finger <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the fingerboard will create a harsher quality than with a vibrato trill. For example, if trilling on the first finger, the second finger is placed very slightly off the string and vibrato is implemented. The second finger will lightly touch the string above the first finger causing the pitch to change. This has a softer quality and many think it is nicer-sounding than a hammered trill. Note: this trill technique only works well for semi-tonal trills, it is far more difficult to vibrato trill for an interval of a tone or more.|$|E

25|$|A Portuguese captain major, {{armed with}} a sword and a shield, strode <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the shore {{encouraging}} his men to continuously press the attack. He ordered them to fire even on the shallops {{to prevent them from}} assisting the Dutch troops. The remaining Dutch troops raised a white flag realizing that they were stranded. At the same time, a cannonball from a shallop hit Mendonça on his head and killed him instantly. Suddenly, Portuguese troops found themselves leaderless and without direction. A sergeant major who was next in command stood irresolute, while the Portuguese attack halted. In panic they abandoned the fight and retired back to the fort in scattered groups. Some of the wounded (Captain Jorge Fernandes the commander of the center, Captain João de Sequeira and four Soldiers) were left behind and they were taken prisoner by the Dutch.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, {{the city}} of Chicago filed a {{negligence}} lawsuit against two of the survivors, William Fenton-Hathaway and John Koranda.

500|$|Viewtiful Joes core {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to a traditional side-scrolling beat 'em up. Taking control of Joe, the player is mostly limited to moving left, right, <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a fixed 2D path. The game contains platforming elements such as the ability to jump and double jump. Combat consists of fighting multiple enemies on screen at once, with the enemies appearing from all directions, including the foreground and background. Joe has the ability to punch, kick, and dodge—which he can do by leaping upward or ducking. Dodging enemies' attacks successfully temporarily dazes them, leaving them wide open for attack. The player has certain number of hit points in the form of [...] "Life Marks" [...] located above the VFX Gauge, which decrease whenever Joe takes damage. Health can be restored by picking up hamburgers.|$|E

500|$|The {{sequence}} {{then moved}} on to celebrate British children's literature. J. K. Rowling began by reading from J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan (whose copyright was given to Great Ormond Street Hospital). The Child Catcher appeared amongst the children, followed by giant puppet representations of villains from British children's literature: the Queen of Hearts, Captain Hook, Cruella de Vil and Lord Voldemort. [...] Minutes later, 32 women playing Mary Poppins descended on flying umbrellas, as the villains deflated and the actors resumed dancing. The music for this sequence included partially rearranged sections from Tubular Bells (with a giant set of tubular bells {{at the rear of the}} stage), Tubular Bells III and, after the villains had been driven away by the Mary Poppins characters, In Dulci Jubilo. [...] During this performance the children in pyjamas jumped <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> their brightly lit beds, creating a memorable image amid the darkness of the stadium.|$|E
500|$|Soft & Cuddly was {{developed}} for The Power house by John George Jones. Jones had previously developed Go to Hell for Triple Six. Go to Hell was published in 1985 and featured [...] "...revolting, crude and downright vile images." [...] When interviewed by Sinclair User, in the October 1987 issue, the programmer was asked [...] "Whatever possessed you to write a game like Soft and Cuddly...". To this Jones responded, [...] "I didn't write the game because I'm a horrible person, I wrote it to amuse myself." [...] Jones also stated [...] "I love the reaction people give, I can't stand 'nice' inoffensive things...". The original version of the game was more gruesome; the babies were being torn apart rather than stretched and [...] "...the sheep was bouncing <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a corpse." [...] When asked how long he would retain interest in computers, Jones stated that he had already lost interest. Soft & Cuddly was released by The Power house during September 1987 in the United Kingdom. The game was later released in Spain {{during the first quarter}} of 1988. The game featured in a competition printed in the November 1987 issue of Sinclair User. The first prize was a day in the company of The Power House's staff including a trip to the London Dungeon. Other prize winners received a copy of Soft & Cuddly or a poster of the game's inlay artwork.|$|E
500|$|American {{recording}} artist Kanye West {{also contributed to}} three tracks on the album; Madonna called him [...] "the black Madonna" [...] and said, [...] "We're comrades in the envelope-pushing genre". Madonna said, [...] "It's {{a little bit of}} a bullfight, but we take turns. He knows that he's walking into a room with a person with a strong point of view, and I do, too. I listen to what he has to say, take it in, and he listens to what I say and takes it in. We didn't agree on everything, but he has good ideas." [...] She told Rolling Stone that of the songs she played him, West connected the most with [...] "Illuminati" [...] and that, [...] "e loved the melody, and he was actually jumping <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the soundboard. He literally stood on top of the mixing board—we were worried he was going to hit his head on the ceiling, but he didn't. He ended up being very excited about that track, and then he added his spin to it, musically, and I love it. To me, he elevated the lyrics with the music. It's like a siren, alerting people." [...] In December 2014, thirteen demos of tracks for the album, including [...] "Illuminati", were leaked to the Internet. To avoid further leaks, Madonna released six completed tracks, including the final version of [...] "Illuminati" [...] with the addition of West's writing and production, with the pre-order for the album on the iTunes Store on December 20, 2014, as an [...] "early Christmas gift".|$|E

500|$|During one scene, a {{frustrated}} Tom Cruise angrily jumps <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a couch while Oprah Winfrey {{sits next to}} him. This is a reference to an incident on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2005, in which Cruise repeatedly jumped on the couch next to Oprah, fell to one knee and loudly professed his love for actress Katie Holmes. Cruise has been repeatedly mocked for his behavior. In another scene, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg are shown to have actor Harrison Ford leashed, chained and ball-gagged, as the actor wears the fedora he wore in the Indiana Jones films. This is {{a reference to the}} twelfth season episode [...] "The China Probrem", in which Lucas and Spielberg literally rape Indiana Jones repeatedly, which served as a commentary by Parker and Stone for the poor quality of the 2008 Spielberg/Lucas film, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. A cartoon image of film director Tim Burton is featured in the episode, despite having not been previously ridiculed by the show. In the episode, Burton is mocked for not having an original idea since the 1988 comedy horror film Beetlejuice, and for his tendency to feature film actor Johnny Depp in so many of his films that he should [...] "just have sex with him [...] already". Cartman's Jennifer Lopez hand-puppet repeatedly demands food from the American restaurant chain Taco Bell, particularly enchiritos, {{which is one of the}} many Hispanic stereotypes utilized by the character. [...] Also, when the celebrities are discussing who to bring in to help capture Mohammed, Barbra Streisand is referenced as [...] "her," [...] to which the discussion goes [...] "her who?" [...] "her" [...] "oh...her." [...] This is slightly reminiscent of the movie Little Shop of Horrors when Rick Moranis and Steve Martin are talking about Audrey, who the dentist had physically abused, where Steve asks [...] "what did I ever do to you" [...] and Rick answers [...] "it wasn't what you did to me, it was what you did to her" [...] Steve: [...] "her? oh...her" ...|$|E
