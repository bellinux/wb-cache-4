The production, celebrating 100 years after Wagner's work had been performed {{for the first time}} as a cycle at the first Bayreuth Festival, became known as the Jahrhundertring (Centenary Ring). Chéreau collaborated with conductor Pierre Boulez, who had recommended him to the festival direction. The French team revolutionised the understanding of Wagner in Germany, as music critic Eleonore Büning wrote in her obituary in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. Chéreau set the scene in the time of the composition, with a critical view of the time's capitalism, industrialism and spiritual background. As Büning and others pointed out, the staging left a standard for productions of the Ring Cycle to follow. Gerhard R. Koch mentioned in his obituary that the <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>direction,</b> scene and light was new for Bayreuth and suggested a critical view on capitalism heading towards fascism.|$|E

A string of propositions concerning magnitude in the abstract, [...] which are equally true of space, time, force, number, and every [...] other magnitude susceptible of aggregation and subdivision. Such [...] propositions, where they are not mere definitions, as some of them [...] are, carry their inductive origin on the face of their [...] enunciation.... Those which declare that two straight lines can not [...] inclose a space, and that two straight lines which cut one another [...] can not both be parallel to a third, are in reality the only ones [...] which express characteristic properties of space, and these it will [...] be worth while to consider more nearly. Now the only clear notion we [...] can form of straightness is uniformity of direction, for space in [...] its ultimate analysis is nothing but an assemblage of distances and [...] directions. And (not to dwell on the notion of continued [...] contemplation, i.e., mental experience, as included in the very [...] idea of uniformity; nor on that of transfer of the contemplating [...] being from point to point, and of experience, during such transfer, [...] of the homogeneity of the interval passed over) we can not even [...] propose the proposition in an intelligible form to any one whose [...] experience ever since he was born has not assured him of the fact. [...] The <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>direction,</b> or that we can not march from a given point [...] by more than one path direct to the same object, is matter of [...] practical experience long before it can by possibility become matter [...] of abstract thought. We can not attempt mentally to exemplify the [...] conditions of the assertion in an imaginary case opposed to it, [...] without violating our habitual recollection of this experience, and [...] defacing our mental picture of space as grounded on it. What but [...] experience, we may ask, can possibly assure us of the homogeneity of [...] the parts of distance, time, force, and measurable aggregates in [...] general, on which the truth of the other axioms depends? As regards [...] the latter axiom, after what has been said it must be clear that the [...] very same course of remarks equally applies to its case, and that [...] its truth is quite as much forced on the mind as that of the former [...] by daily and hourly experience, ... including always, be it [...] observed, in our notion of experience, that which is gained by [...] contemplation of the inward picture which the mind forms to itself [...] in any proposed case, or which it arbitrarily selects as an [...] example—such picture, in virtue of the extreme simplicity of these [...] primary relations, being called up by the imagination with as much [...] vividness and clearness as could be done by any external impression, [...] which is the only meaning we can attach to the word intuition, as [...] applied to such relations.” ...|$|E

6000|$|Assume {{that the}} {{diameter}} of the missing planet was 20,000 miles; that its solid crust was a thousand miles thick; that under this came a shell of molten metallic matter which was another thousand miles thick; and that the space, 16,000 miles in diameter, within this, was occupied by the equally dense mass of gases above the [...] "critical point", which, entering into a proto-chemical combination, caused the destroying explosion. The primary fissures in the crust must have been far apart--probably averaging distances between them as great as the thickness of the crust. Supposing them approximately equidistant, there would, in the equatorial periphery, be between 60 and 70 fissures. By the time the primary fragments thus separated had been heaved a mile outwards, the fissures formed would severally have, at the surface, a width of 170 odd yards. Of course these great masses, as soon as they moved, would themselves begin to fall in pieces; especially at their bounding surfaces. But passing over the resulting complications, we see that when the masses had been propelled 10 miles outwards, the fissures between them would be each a mile wide. Notwithstanding the enormous forces at work, an appreciable interval would elapse before these vast portions of the crust could be put in motion with any considerable velocities. Perhaps the estimate will be under the mark if we assume that it took 10 seconds to propel them through the first mile, and that, by implication, at the end of 20 seconds they had travelled 4 miles, {{and at the end of}} 30 seconds 9 miles. Supposing this granted, let us ask what would be taking place in each intervening fissure a thousand miles deep, which, in the space of half a minute, had opened out to nearly a mile wide, and in the subsequent half minute to a chasm approaching 3 miles in width. There would first be propelled through it enormous jets of the molten metals composing the internal liquid shell; and these would part into relatively small masses as they were shot into space. Presently, as the chasm opened to some miles in width, the molten metals would begin to be followed by the equally dense gaseous matter behind, and the two would rush out together. Soon the gases, predominating, would carry with them the portions of the liquid shell continually collapsing; until the blast became one filled with millions of small masses, billions of smaller masses, and trillions of drops. These would be driven into space in a stream, the emission of which would continue for many seconds or even several minutes. Remembering the rate of motion of the jets emitted from the solar surface, and supposing that the blasts produced by this explosion reached only one-tenth of that rate, these myriads of small masses and drops would be propelled with planetary velocities, and in approximately the same direction. I say approximately, because they would be made to deviate somewhat by the friction and irregularities of the chasm passed through, and also by the rotation of the planet. Observe, however, that though they would all have immense velocities, their velocities would not be equal. During its earlier stages the blast would be considerably retarded by the resistance which the sides of its channel offered. When this became relatively small the velocity of the blast would reach its maximum; from which it would decline when the space for emission became very wide, and the pressure behind consequently less. Hence these almost infinitely numerous particles of planet-spray, as we might call it, as well as those formed by the condensation of the metallic vapours accompanying them, would forthwith begin to part company: some going rapidly in advance, and others falling behind; until the stream of them, perpetually elongating, formed an orbit round the Sun, or rather an assemblage of innumerable orbits, separating widely at aphelion and perihelion, but approximating midway, where they might fall within a space of, say, some two millions of miles, as do the orbits of the November meteors. At a later stage of the explosion, when the large masses, having moved far outwards, had also fallen to pieces of every size, from that of Vesta to that of an aerolite, and when the channels just described had ceased to exist, the contents of the planet would disperse themselves with lower velocities and without any <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>direction.</b> Hence we see causes alike for the streams of shooting stars, for the solitary shooting stars visible to the naked eye, and for the telescopic shooting stars a score times more numerous.|$|E

In years gone by, no scholar or practitioner who valued his/her reputation would accord diversity greater importance than is deemed necessary to sustain an organization’s “unity of purpose”. Adherents of the “formal organization ” school took care of diversity by subordinating it to the organization’s underlying purpose and the prevailing “rules ” regime.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedAfter {{the terrorist attacks}} of September 11, 2001, the U. S. Coast Guard shifted much of its effort toward Maritime Homeland Security activities. In response to this major shift in mission priorities, the Coast Guard is merging its Operational and Marine Safety field units into Sector commands. This reorganization is designed to ensure unity of effort, allow more efficient use of resources, improve training of Coast Guard members, and ensure better customer service. This thesis shows that further reorganization will be necessary at the operational and strategic levels of the Coast Guard. The organization-wide changes recommended by the author will allow the Coast Guard to align with the new Sector field commands, better align with the other agencies within the Department of Homeland Security, and ensure the critical tenets of unity of command, <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>direction,</b> and unity of accountability are realized.
