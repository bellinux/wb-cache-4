5|$|Burnham-on-Sea {{is a town}} in Somerset, England, at {{the mouth}} of the River Parrett and Bridgwater Bay.

According to the 2011 census the population of the parish (i.e. including Highbridge) was 19,576, of which the populations of the wards of Burnham Central and Burnham North, which made <b>up</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the town, totalled 13,601.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{water is}} a form of water that {{contains}} a larger than normal amount of the hydrogen isotope deuterium, also known as heavy hydrogen, rather than the common hydrogen-1 isotope that makes <b>up</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the hydrogen in ordinary water. Deuterium was discovered by Harold Urey in 1931 and he was later able to concentrate it in water. His mentor Gilbert Newton Lewis isolated the first sample of pure heavy water by electrolysis in 1933.|$|E

According to the 2010 Indices of Multiple Deprivation Manchester is the 4th most deprived local council in the England. Unemployment throughout 2012–13 averaged 11.9%, which was above the national average, but lower than some of the country's other comparable large cities. On the other hand, Greater Manchester is home to more multi-millionaires than anywhere outside London, with the City of Manchester taking <b>up</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the tally.

5|$|Over {{the centuries}} the frescoes were greatly altered and damaged. In 1746 the upper levels were painted {{over by the}} artist Vincenzo Meucci, {{covering}} <b>up</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> Masolino's work. Then, in 1771, the church was ruined by fire. The Brancacci Chapel, though structurally undamaged by the fire, suffered great damages to its frescoes. It {{was not until the}} years 1981–1990 that a full-scale restoration of the chapel was undertaken, restoring the frescoes to approximately their original state. The paintings had suffered some irreparable damage though, particularly the parts that were painted a secco: in The Tribute Money, the leaves on the trees were gone, while Christ's robe had lost much of its original azure brilliance.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Concord, Pierce {{resumed his}} law work; in one notable case he defended the {{religious}} liberty of the Shakers, the insular sect {{who were being}} threatened with legal action over accusations of child abuse. His role as a party leader, however, continued to take <b>up</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> his attention. He continued to wrangle with Senator Hale, who was stridently anti-slavery and had opposed the war, stances that Pierce regarded as needless agitation.|$|E
5|$|Since baryons are {{composed}} of quarks, they participate in the strong interaction. Leptons, on the other hand, are not composed of quarks and as such {{do not participate in}} the strong interaction. The most famous baryons are the protons and neutrons that make <b>up</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the mass of the visible matter in the universe, whereas electrons, the other major component of atoms, are leptons. Each baryon has a corresponding antiparticle known as an antibaryon in which quarks are replaced by their corresponding antiquarks. For example, a proton is made of two up quarks and one down quark, while its corresponding antiparticle, the antiproton, is made of two up antiquarks and one down antiquark.|$|E

5|$|The Falkland Islands are a biogeographical part of {{the mild}} Antarctic zone, with strong {{connections}} to {{the flora and fauna}} of Patagonia in mainland South America. Land birds make <b>up</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the Falklands' avifauna; 63 species breed on the islands, including 16 endemic species. There is also abundant arthropod diversity on the islands. The Falklands' flora consists of 163 native vascular species. The islands' only native terrestrial mammal, the warrah, was hunted to extinction by European settlers.|$|E
5|$|The red-billed chough's food {{consists}} {{largely of}} insects, spiders and other invertebrates {{taken from the}} ground, with ants probably being the most significant item. The Central Asian subspecies P. p. centralis will perch {{on the backs of}} wild or domesticated mammals to feed on parasites. Although invertebrates make <b>up</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the chough's diet, it will eat vegetable matter including fallen grain, and in the Himalayas has been reported as damaging barley crops by breaking off the ripening heads to extract the corn. In the Himalayas, they form large flocks in winter.|$|E
5|$|The {{reticulate}} whipray preys on {{a variety}} of benthic and neritic organisms, including crabs, shrimps, mantis shrimps, bivalves, gastropods, worms, jellyfish, and bony fishes. In the western Indian Ocean, about two-thirds of its diet consists of fishes, in particular ponyfish and anchovies, with shrimps and other crustaceans making <b>up</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the remainder. By contrast, rays in Australian waters are apparently not piscivorous, and are known to consume penaeid prawns. Known parasites of this species include Anthrobothrium loculatum, Dendromonocotyle colorni, Halysiorhynchus macrocephalus, Monocotyle helicophallus, M. multiparous, and M. spiremae, Thaumatocotyle australensis, and Tylocephalum chiralensis.|$|E
