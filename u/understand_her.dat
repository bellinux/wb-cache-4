5|$|Six-year-old Maisie (Onata Aprile) {{lives in}} a New York {{apartment}} with her parents, Susanna (Julianne Moore), a singer in a rock band, and Beale (Steve Coogan), an international art dealer. Susanna and Beale argue with each other viciously and constantly, often ignoring Maisie and leaving her {{in the care of}} their nanny, Margo (Joanna Vanderham). Maisie does not always <b>understand</b> <b>her</b> parents' actions, such as when Susanna hires a locksmith to change the lock on the apartment's front door to keep Beale out. When they decide to separate, both parents are granted joint custody of Maisie.|$|E

5|$|Wall {{describes}} the marriage as traumatic, with frequent rapes and miscarriages. She recounts {{that she did}} not receive any sex education while in school and as a result was unable to <b>understand</b> <b>her</b> husband's advances. As her marriage with her cousin fell apart, she began to spend nights sleeping in her truck, and at that point met former FLDS member Lamont Barlow. Wall, then 17, began an affair with the then 25-year-old Barlow, who encouraged her to leave the church with him. The affair was eventually uncovered when she became pregnant by him, and Jeffs had the marriage to Steed annulled. Wall left the FLDS and married Barlow, having two children with him.|$|E
5|$|Edward's {{departure}} leaves Bella {{depressed and}} isolated for months. Unable to <b>understand</b> <b>her</b> erratic and despondent actions, her father, Charlie, {{who works as}} the police chief of Forks, decides to send Bella {{to live with her}} mother in Jacksonville, Florida, but Bella opposes, and decides {{to spend more time with}} her other friends in Forks. After seeing a movie with Jessica, Bella sees a group of men on motorcycles. This reminds her of when Edward previously rescued her from a previous assault, and she sees his image, warning her to keep away. Bella discovers that any thrill-seeking activities she engages will evoke Edward's preserved image. She is also comforted by Jacob Black, a cheerful companion who helps to ease her pain over losing Edward. When Jacob suddenly begins avoiding her, Bella discovers that he, and others of his tribe, are descended from a long line of werewolves, and Jacob has just undergone his first transformation. Bella also learns that the werewolves are an age-old enemy of vampires. Jacob's pack members are on constant alert for Victoria, a vampire seeking to avenge the death of her mate, James, who was killed by Edward after James kidnapped and tried to kill Bella. They rescue Bella from Laurent when he tries to kill her. With Jacob busy coming to terms with his shape-shifting nature, Bella again finds herself alone, and she returns to seeking thrill-inducing activities.|$|E

60|$|The surgeon <b>understood</b> <b>her</b> wishes, and {{proceeded}} {{at once to}} gratify them.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} her quickly. Perhaps he <b>understood</b> <b>her</b> better than the others.|$|R
60|$|She did not speak, but {{she smiled}} so that I <b>understood</b> <b>her</b> answer.|$|R
25|$|Cielle, a minor {{character}} in the flash animation film Broken Saints, is an albinistic occultist with white dreadlocks and pink eyes who gives a prophetic tarot card reading to characters Raimi and Oran. Although Oran scorns her, she is not offended and claims that many people don't <b>understand</b> <b>her</b> condition.|$|E
25|$|The {{specific}} {{genre of}} The Woman Warrior has been disputed due to Kingston's blend of perspectives, specifically traditional Chinese folktale and memoir. With this mixture, Kingston tries to provide her {{audience with the}} cultural, familial, and personal context needed to <b>understand</b> <b>her</b> unique position as a first-generation Chinese-American woman.|$|E
25|$|Saby's parents confront him. They {{point out}} that he has ignored Kashmira in his zealous enthusiasm for cricket. How will she be able to love him when he is not able to <b>understand</b> <b>her</b> needs? He finally understands this, and returns to Kashmira with a renewed zest for making her happy. They are reunited.|$|E

60|$|Of {{course she}} said it only by her looks; and Agnes quite <b>understood</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|Norman <b>understood</b> <b>her</b> thought, but {{responded by}} {{more of a}} sigh than was quite comfortable.|$|R
25|$|The protagonist and playable {{character}} of Your Diary, he harbors {{a crush on}} Sayuki, but is unable to express his feelings for her. Tomoki works as a member in the library committee alongside her, in hopes of coming to <b>understand</b> <b>her</b> more. He is a generally serious person, yet tends to be oblivious in terms of love, despite harboring a crush on Sayuki. Upon being given a diary, all of his happiest memories are to be written down.|$|E
25|$|Sarah is {{also more}} open to {{explaining}} {{their way of life}} to the humans than her husband is. Leslie tries to curb her, but Sarah says what she believes she should say. Sarah does not fully share Leslie's prejudices and tries to make the humans <b>understand</b> <b>her.</b> For example, Sarah shares information on their reproduction and how she and Leslie met. It is also Sarah who tells the humans why they decided {{to come out of the}} sea. Leslie is reluctant to part with this information.|$|E
25|$|The other {{significant}} {{form of communication}} is between the two couples and is different between the genders. Nancy is very curious about and open with the lizards. Though she does become slightly frustrated by their limitations, she tries to help them by explaining aspects of human life they do not <b>understand.</b> <b>Her</b> general kindness toward them and offer of help when the lizards are deciding whether to stay on land or {{to go back to}} the sea influences their decision. Charlie is less forthcoming and more suspicious. He has a hard time accepting the lizards and quickly becomes testy when they do not understand his explanations.|$|E
60|$|Elsie's {{smile was}} sympathetic, for {{she thought she}} <b>understood</b> <b>her</b> friend's belief in Rankine's talents.|$|R
60|$|Wayland, listening, fancied he <b>understood</b> <b>her</b> desire, {{and said}} nothing that might arouse Nash's curiosity.|$|R

25|$|For {{the first}} 2,000 {{miles of the}} voyage to the islands, Aubrey {{switches}} his pendant to the elderly 64-gun ship of the line HMS Raisonnable. The Caroline is taken; Corbett sails her, christened HMS Bourbonnaise, with dispatches to Cape Town and England. The rest of the convoy returns to Cape Town. Aubrey shifts back to HMS Boadicea and sails upon news of more merchant ships taken by the French. The convoy is caught in a major hurricane, whence it sails back to Cape Town for repairs, receiving the first mail in many months. Sophia's letters are water-damaged, so Aubrey does not <b>understand</b> <b>her</b> full message.|$|E
25|$|In 1893, Nietzsche's sister Elisabeth {{returned}} from Nueva Germania in Paraguay following {{the suicide of}} her husband. She read and studied Nietzsche's works and, piece by piece, took control of them and their publication. Overbeck eventually suffered dismissal and Gast finally co-operated. After the death of Franziska in 1897, Nietzsche lived in Weimar, where Elisabeth cared for him and allowed visitors, including Rudolf Steiner (who in 1895 had written {{one of the first}} books praising Nietzsche), to meet her uncommunicative brother. Elisabeth at one point {{went so far as to}} employ Steiner as a tutor to help her to <b>understand</b> <b>her</b> brother's philosophy. Steiner abandoned the attempt after only a few months, declaring that it was impossible to teach her anything about philosophy.|$|E
25|$|Poor old Keeper, Emily's {{faithful}} {{friend and}} worshipper, seemed to <b>understand</b> <b>her</b> {{like a human}} being. One evening, when the four friends were sitting closely round {{the fire in the}} sitting-room, Keeper forced himself in between Charlotte and Emily and mounted himself on Emily’s lap; finding the space too limited for his comfort he pressed himself forward on to the guest’s knees, making himself quite comfortable. Emily’s heart was won by the unresisting endurance of the visitor, little guessing that she herself, being in close contact, was the inspiring cause of submission to Keeper’s preference. Sometimes Emily would delight in showing off Keeper—make him frantic in action, and roar with the voice of a lion. It was a terrifying exhibition within the walls of an ordinary sitting-room. Keeper was a solemn mourner at Emily’s funeral and never recovered his cheerfulness.|$|E
60|$|THE YOUNG LADY. I <b>understood</b> <b>her</b> to do so. But really I think I'd better go.|$|R
60|$|The {{words were}} light, but he <b>understood</b> <b>her.</b> He drank {{and then came}} {{straight}} toward her.|$|R
60|$|I <b>understood</b> <b>her</b> very well, for I {{had been}} {{accustomed}} to the fluent tongue of Madame Pierrot.|$|R
25|$|Clara Barton {{became an}} {{educator}} in 1838 for 12 years in schools in Canada and West Georgia. Barton fared {{well as a}} teacher and knew how to handle rambunctious children, particularly the boys, since as a child she enjoyed her male cousins' and brothers' company. She learned how to act like them, making it easier for her to relate to and control the boys in her classroom since they respected her. After her mother's death in 1851, the family home closed down. Barton decided to further her education by pursuing writing and languages at the Clinton Liberal Institute in New York. In this college town, she developed many friendships that broadened her point of view on many issues concurring at the time. The principal of the institute recognized her tremendous abilities and admired her work. This friendship lasted for many years, eventually turning into a romance. As a writer, her terminology was pristine and easy to <b>understand.</b> <b>Her</b> writings and bodies of work could instruct the local statesmen. No one could exceed her outstanding service to humanity in war and in peace.|$|E
25|$|Her {{husband was}} {{appointed}} artist to Charles Texier's archaeological mission, which {{was sent to}} excavate Magnesia ad Sipylum (now Manisa in Turkey). He died there on 28 September 1842 and the following year she married Edmond Cavé, twelve years her senior. She continued teaching and writing, gaining a certain notoriety under the name Madame Cavé and obtaining several official commissions to produce paintings for churches. Although her husband's position between 1843 and 1852 certainly proved useful to her artistic career, {{it was not the}} decisive influence upon it as some writers have argued. She effectively exhibited at the Paris Salon and gained critical acclaim before her marriage to Cavé and her career and official commissions continued after the 1848 French Revolution had cost Cavé his post and after Cavé's death in 1852. Other authors attribute her notoriety to her intimate relationship with Delacroix, though this too can be argued against - she was in contact with the whole artistic milieu of her era and able to <b>understand</b> <b>her</b> artistic contemporaries as an artist herself.|$|E
25|$|She is an {{extremely}} private person who keeps her thoughts and feelings to herself and hates when someone tries to <b>understand</b> <b>her,</b> which {{is thought to be}} why Edward is unable to hear her thoughts. She is also known to be incredibly stubborn with her self, because of her determination to become a vampire in order to be with Edward forever. She is also said to possess poor acting skills. Ironically, she demonstrates good acting ability in Twilight when she makes her father believe that she has dumped Edward and is leaving Forks. She is a very shy and timid girl with a stiff uptight position, habit of biting her lip, which she shares with Kristen Stewart. Bella knits together her eyebrows when feeling strong emotions such as anxiety. As a human, Bella easily fainted at the sight or smell of blood, which she said smells like rust and salt in Twilight, though it changes after she became a vampire. Bella is also shown in Breaking Dawn, to have a good mood climate, and is able to run away from the smell of human blood when she goes on her first hunting trip as a vampire.|$|E
60|$|Jimmy <b>understood</b> <b>her,</b> {{and made}} no further disclaimer. Still, his face grew {{somewhat}} hard, and he moved abruptly.|$|R
60|$|Theodora better <b>understood</b> <b>her</b> mother's stifled {{sympathy for}} Violet, and her father's more openly shown feeling for Arthur.|$|R
