50|$|In 1588 he instigated a {{war with}} the Golkonda and Bijapur Sultanates and {{captured}} some of the territories lost earlier by his predecessor. Kasturiranga Nayaka, a scion of Recherla Velama dynasty was sent to check the combined armies of the Sultanates. Hindu army led by Kasturiranga and his son Yachamanedu fought a series of battles with patriotic zeal and achieved the success. Muslim soldiers who escaped in these battles from the Vijayanagar army joined their main troops on the <b>upper</b> <b>bank</b> of river pennar. Historic accounts say that the strength of sultanates army was more than 120,000 and Turko-Afghan gunners were with them to fire their Artillery units.

40|$|Convergence {{of sensory}} {{modalities}} in the nonhuman primate cerebral cortex is still poorly understood. We present an anatomical tracing {{study in which}} polysensory association cortex located at the fundus and <b>upper</b> <b>bank</b> of the rostral superior temporal sulcus presents reciprocal connections with primary olfactory structures. At the same time, projections from this polysensory area reach multiple primary olfactory centres. Retrograde (Fast Blue) and anterograde (biotinylated dextran–amine and 3 H-amino acids) tracers were injected into primary olfactory structures and rostral superior temporal sulcus. Retrograde tracers restricted to the anterior olfactory nucleus resulted in labelled neurons in the rostral portion of the <b>upper</b> <b>bank</b> and fundus of superior temporal sulcus. Injections of biotinylated dextran–amine at the fundus and <b>upper</b> <b>bank</b> of the superior temporal sulcus confirmed this projection by labelling axons in the dorsal and lateral portions of the anterior olfactory nucleus, as well as piriform, periamygdaloid and entorhinal cortices. Retrograde tracer injections at the rostral superior temporal sulcus resulted in neuronal labelling in the anterior olfactory nucleus, piriform, periamygdaloid and entorhinal cortices, thus providing confirmation of the reciprocity between primary olfactory structures and the cortex at the rostral superior temporal sulcus. The reciprocal connections between the rostral part of superior temporal sulcus and primary olfactory structures represent a convergence for olfactory and other sensory modalities at the cortex of the rostral temporal lobe...|$|R

40|$|A {{conceptual}} framework {{for the design of}} biotechnical streambank revetment is proposed. It is intended to be simple in practice, flexible in being widely applicable, familiar in retaining cer­tain aspects of current practice while being patterned after other aspects, and encouraging a more environmentally sensitive approach to reliable streambank protection for INDOT projects. It distinguishes between a toe zone, where traditional hard armoring techniques such as those already included in the INDOT standard designs are more appropriate, and an <b>upper</b> <b>bank</b> zone where vegetation-based techniques would typically be applied. Default techniques are identified to simplify the choice of measures for 2 ̆ 7 routine 2 ̆ 7 problems, but more case-specific techniques may also be selected. Primary techniques that offer immediate protection on their own are also distin­guished from supplementary techniques that are used only in combination with other (primary) techniques. The boundary between the toe zone and the <b>upper</b> <b>bank</b> zone is proposed to be the maximum of the ordinary high water mark (or bankfull elevation), the elevation corresponding to the 2 -year discharge, and the elevation corresponding to the point that is one third up the slope from the bank toe at the design discharge (for streambank protection). For the <b>upper</b> <b>bank</b> zone, for bank slopes up to 2 H: 1 V, regrading and revegetation with herbaceous species together with the use of rolled erosion control products (RECPs) is proposed as the default. The other (non-default) main primary technique for the <b>upper</b> <b>bank</b> zone is the vegetated mechanically stabilized earth (VMSE, or vegetated reinforced soil slope VRSS, or soil lifts) option (where revegetation with herbaceous species is also considered standard). This requires more engineering and construct­ion effort but is appropriate for those projects where a more vertical (up to maximum bank slope of 1 H: 1 V) solution is desired. The supplementary techniques to be included are live staking to be used with the regrading option, and brush-layering to be used with the VMSE option...|$|R

50|$|The {{full length}} of the Morriston Loop was opened on 2 October 1871 and from that date all {{passenger}} trains ran via Morriston and Clydach, with a new station at Glais. The old station at Llansamlet was retained for goods but closed to passengers and Birchgrove closed completely, so the old main line between Glais and <b>Upper</b> <b>Bank</b> was now operated by goods trains only.|$|R

60|$|As in {{the models}} {{from which she}} had been built, she rowed two banks of oars, the one worked by men upon deck, the others through small port-holes. The latter could only be used when the weather was fine; when the sea was high they were closed up and fastened. The lower-deck oars were each rowed by one man, while the <b>upper</b> <b>bank,</b> which were longer and heavier, had each two men to work it.|$|R

40|$|The gas {{reservoir}} of the Lower Cambrian Longwangmiao Fm in the Sichuan Basin is a supergiant integral marine carbonate {{gas reservoir}} whose single scale {{is currently the}} largest in China. In order to figure out its sedimentary model and reservoir genesis, its geological structures and sedimentary settings and facies were analyzed comprehensively and the lithofacies paleographic map was plotted. It is revealed that the following sedimentary facies are successively developed in the Longwangmiao Fm from West Sichuan to Southeast Chongqing: diamictic tidal flat at the back ramp, grain <b>bank</b> (the <b>upper</b> <b>bank)</b> at the inner/shallow ramp – interbank sea (depression), deeper open bay at the platform depression of inner ramp → evaporative lagoon → evaporative tidal flat, tempestite at the middle ramp – barrier beach – mud mound beach (the lower bank), and outer ramp – basin. Accordingly, the specific sedimentary model of dual grain banks in the Longwangmiao Fm carbonate ramp was established as follows. Firstly, in this model, dual grain banks are symmetrically developed with Wanzhou–Yibin platform depression as the axis, on whose dual sides the paleohighs have shallow water bodies with strong energy. Compared with the classical model, the new one has a new <b>upper</b> <b>bank</b> which is developed around the paleohighs covering an area of about 8  ×  104  km 2. Secondly, the <b>upper</b> <b>bank</b> is large for its paleogeomorphology being located at the highest position with the strongest water energy during deposition. Therefore, it is prone to dolomitization and meteoric dissolution respectively during contemporaneous–penecontemporaneous hot-dry and hot-humid periods, and especially the Caledonian–Early Hercynian denudation wedge out tends to undergo post-supergene multiphase karstification. Therefore, quality reservoirs are more developed on scale. Thirdly, the intergranular pores and vermes moldic pores were dissolved and enlarged due to the multiphase atmospheric fresh water leaching, and together with tectonism, grain bank facies controlled multicyclic laminated–quasi-laminated, fracture-pore and cellular vuggy karst reservoirs were formed...|$|R
60|$|The fall of Fort Niagara {{accomplished}} {{all that}} the English government and the colonists had hoped for. It broke the chain of defenses the French had established between the lakes and the lower Mississippi, and closely following this disaster the enemy were compelled to vacate Venango, Presqu'île, La Boeuf, and other points, including the trading posts on the Ohio and the Kinotah. They retired to Detroit, and to the <b>upper</b> <b>bank</b> of the St. Lawrence, and the English and colonists quickly took possession of the places vacated.|$|R
