50|$|Triumph Motorcycles {{produced}} {{its first}} single-cylinder <b>unit</b> <b>construction</b> model with the 149 cc Terrier launched in 1952. It was quickly {{followed by the}} more popular 196 cc Tiger Cub in 1953. They made the first twin-cylinder <b>unit</b> <b>construction</b> model in 1957 {{with the release of}} the 350 cc Twenty One 3TA (so named because it was approximately twenty-one cubic inches capacity). The 500 cc Triumph 5TA followed, and the 650 cc models were made <b>unit</b> <b>construction</b> in 1963. The 1963â€”1969 <b>unit</b> <b>construction</b> 650 cc Triumph Bonneville has become sought- after models, partly as the 1970-onward oil-in-frame chassis was considered inferior.|$|R
50|$|The BSA Bantam {{range of}} {{two-stroke}} engines introduced the <b>unit</b> <b>construction</b> concept to BSA since its introduction in 1949. BSA produced their first four-stroke <b>unit</b> <b>construction</b> singles in 1959 when they introduced the C15 {{to replace the}} venerable c12 single. The <b>unit</b> <b>construction</b> (in contrast to the separate engine and gearbox of the C10/C11 and c12) gave the family of motorcycles started by this model its familiar name.|$|R

50|$|When the Yamaha XS 650 was {{launched}} in 1968 it {{had one of the}} most advanced engines in its class of large parallel twin motorcycles. The engine and gearbox are <b>unit</b> <b>construction</b> with the crankcase split horizontally for ease of assembly whereas almost all contemporaries in its class in 1968 are either <b>unit</b> <b>construction</b> with a vertically split crankcase or pre-unit construction with separate engine and gearbox. The XS650's engine was used in AMA Professional Dirt Track Racing by national champion Kenny Roberts. In 1968 only the Laverda 750S, and the Honda CB350, also launched that year, matched the XS 650's modernity of <b>unit</b> <b>construction</b> and SOHC valve operation.|$|R

Triumph modified their large pre-unit 500 and 650 cc parallel twins into unit-construction engines. The smaller Triumph 350 and 500 cc twins had been <b>unit</b> <b>construction</b> from their introduction in 1957. The decision by Lucas to discontinue making dynamos and magnetos, and to produce only alternators and coil ignition systems, {{was a significant}} factor in forcing the redesign.|$|R

50|$|BSA {{acquired}} the Triumph marque in 1951, and the BSA C15 250 cc four stroke {{was derived from}} the 200 cc Triumph Tiger Cub, itself coming from the 150cc Terrier. Edward Turner became head of the BSA automotive division and in 1958 BSA introduced the concept of <b>unit</b> <b>construction,</b> where the engine and gearbox were combined in one piece rather than as separate components. The BSA C15 'Star' was the first <b>unit</b> <b>construction</b> model and proved more reliable and economical than its predecessor, the pre-unit BSA C11.|$|R
