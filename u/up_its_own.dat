5|$|The English East India Company {{was first}} {{permitted}} to set <b>up</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> garrison in 1665 to guard its settlements. Notable amongst the early {{operations of the}} Company's forces were the defence of the city from Mughal and Maratha invaders and from the incursions of the Nawab of Carnatic. In 1713, the Madras forces under Lieutenant John de Morgan distinguished themselves in the siege of Fort St David and in putting down Richard Raworth's Rebellion.|$|E
5|$|The pro-independence republican party, Sinn Féin, {{received}} overwhelming endorsement in {{the general}} election of 1918, and in 1919 proclaimed an Irish Republic, setting <b>up</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> parliament (Dáil Éireann) and government. Simultaneously the Volunteers, which became known as the Irish Republican Army (IRA), launched a three-year guerrilla war, which ended in a truce in July 1921 (although violence continued until June 1922, mostly in Northern Ireland).|$|E
5|$|An enemy scout {{discovered}} Nulli Secunda quietly {{attempting to}} regain control with their Territorial Control Units (TCU). At around 14:00 UTC, with an hour remaining before Nulli Secunda could regain control, the CFC and Russian coalition sent a capital fleet to the station. RAZOR Alliance took the station, and the Russians destroyed the N3/PL Territorial Control Unit and set <b>up</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> TCU {{in order to establish}} control. Capturing the B-R5RB system would enable the CFC and Russian coalition to trap Pandemic Legion assets, including hundreds of capital and sub-capital ships, thus preventing those ships from joining the war. CFC and Russian coalition forces scrambled to gain control of the system, with thousands of players logging on and preparing their fleets.|$|E

5|$|Each troop {{is divided}} into patrols of eight or so Scouts led by a patrol leader elected from within the patrol. Patrol {{meetings}} are generally held during the weekly troop meeting. The patrol's independence from the troop varies among troops and between activities. Patrols' autonomy becomes more visible at campouts, where each patrol may set <b>up</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> camping and cooking area. Divisions between patrols may disappear during an event which {{only a small part}} of the troop attends. Patrols may hold meetings and even excursions separately from the rest of the troop.|$|E
5|$|In Queensland, P. fimbriata is {{reluctant}} {{to jump into the}} webs of prey spiders, while other Portia species do this at any opportunity. The Queensland orb web spider Argiope appensa shakes its web violently to shake off intruders, and P. fimbriata finds a detour that allows it to abseil on to the prey. When the web spider Zosis genicularis is busy wrapping <b>up</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> prey and is less aware of other predators, P. fimbriata uses this activity as a type of smokescreen to approach the web spider.|$|E
5|$|In a discography of the LPO {{published}} in 1997, Philip Stuart listed 280 recordings made at Kingsway Hall and 353 at Abbey Road. By the early 2000s the late 20th-century boom in classical recordings had ended, and with studio work in decline for all orchestras, the LPO set <b>up</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> CD label in 2005, featuring recordings taken mainly from live concerts. With {{the exception of}} Steinberg, all the orchestra's principal conductors from Beecham to Jurowski are represented in the label's releases. The orchestra lists among its best-selling recordings Mahler's Eighth Symphony, conducted by Tennstedt, and works by Rachmaninoff and Tchaikovsky with Jurowski.|$|E

5|$|Onhan, on {{the other}} hand, belongs to the Western Visayan subgroup, which {{includes}} Kinaray-a and Aklanon {{as well as several}} minor languages spoken on Mindoro, Palawan, and some small islands in between. Its speakers are mainly from the southern portion of Tablas Island, in the municipalities of San Andres, Santa Maria, Alcantara, Ferrol, Looc, and Santa Fe, {{as well as in the}} municipality of San Jose in Carabao Island. Finally, Asi is not classified under any specific subgroup of Visayan, and instead makes <b>up</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> immediate branch of Visayan. David Paul Zorc, a linguist from the Australian National University whose expertise is on Philippine languages, notes that Asi speakers may have been the first Visayan speakers in the region. He also suggests that Asi may have a Cebuano substratum and that many of its words may have been influenced by the later influx of other languages such as Romblomanon. It is spoken in the island municipalities of Banton, Corcuera and Concepcion, as well as in Odiongan and Calatrava in Tablas. Hiligaynon is spoken in municipalities near Capiz and Aklan.|$|E
5|$|Quisling now {{reached the}} high-water mark of his {{political}} power. On 10 April, Bräuer travelled to Elverum where the legitimate Nygaardsvold government now sat. On Hitler's orders, he demanded that King Haakon appoint Quisling head of a new government, thereby securing a peaceful transition of power. Haakon rejected this demand. He went further {{in a meeting with}} his cabinet, letting it be known that he would sooner abdicate than appoint any government headed by Quisling. Hearing this, the government unanimously voted to support the king's stance, and urged the people to continue their resistance. With his popular support gone, Quisling ceased to be of use to Hitler. Germany retracted its support for his rival government, preferring instead to build <b>up</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> independent governing commission. In this way, Quisling was manoeuvred out of power by Bräuer and a coalition of his former allies, including Hjort, who now saw him as a liability. Even his political allies, including Prytz, deserted him.|$|E

50|$|Soul (Psyche) is {{produced}} by Intellect, {{and so is the}} third principle in the Neoplatonic system. It is a mind, like Intellect, but it does not grasp all of <b>its</b> <b>own</b> content as one. Therefore with Soul, Time comes to be, as a measure of Soul's movement from one object of thought to another. Intellect tries to grasp the One, and ends <b>up</b> producing <b>its</b> <b>own</b> ideas as <b>its</b> content. Soul attempts to grasp Intellect in its return, and ends <b>up</b> producing <b>its</b> <b>own</b> secondary unfoldings of the Forms in Intellect. Soul, in turn, produces Body, the material world.|$|R

In January 2013 Larry sold his franchises to Kelly Racing and vacated the Moorabbin workshop.|$|E

Lacking funds in the 16th century, Gelre had its soldiers provide for themselves by pillaging enemy terrain. These soldiers were a great menace to the Burgundian Netherlands, as when they pillaged The Hague.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the infection, Iran assembled a team to combat it. With more than 30,000 IP addresses affected in Iran, an official said that the infection was fast spreading in Iran and the problem had been compounded by the ability of Stuxnet to mutate. Iran had set <b>up</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> systems to clean up infections and had advised against using the Siemens SCADA antivirus since it is suspected that the antivirus was actually embedded with codes which update Stuxnet instead of eradicating it.|$|E
