5|$|The next day, McNish, McCarthy and Vincent {{were picked}} up. They {{were unable to}} {{recognise}} Worsley, freshly shaven, when he stepped ashore. The James Caird, which had been pulled <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> and turned over {{to serve as a}} shelter, was also retrieved.|$|E
5|$|Another {{approach}} {{was used by}} the LIMPET 500 (Land Installed Marine Power Energy Transformer) energy converter which was installed on the island of Islay by Wavegen Ltd. It was a shore-based unit and generated power when waves run <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> creating pressure inside an inclined oscillating water column. This in turn creates pneumatic power which drives the twin 250kW generators. Islay LIMPET was opened in 2001 and was the world's first commercial scale wave-energy device. In March 2013 Voith Hydro decided to close down Wavegen choosing to concentrate on tidal power projects.|$|E
5|$|On the 16th RCT front, at {{the eastern}} end of Easy Red, was another area between strongpoints. This allowed G/16 and the support {{battalion}} to escape complete destruction in their advance <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach.</b> Nevertheless, most of G/16's 63 casualties for the day came before they had reached the shingle. The other 2nd Battalion company landed in the second wave; H/16 came in a few hundred yards to the left, opposite the E-3 draw, and suffered for it – they were put out of action for several hours.|$|E

5|$|Le Trésor De Rackham Le Rouge began {{serialisation}} as a daily {{strip in}} Le Soir from 19 February 1943. The {{title of the}} new adventure had been announced in an advertisement in the newspaper two days previously. In Belgium, it was then published in a 62-page book format by Editions Casterman in 1944. Red Rackham's Treasure contained one of Hergé's two favourite illustrations from The Adventures of Tintin. It combines three actions encapsulating a sequence of events into one drawing: Haddock striding <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> in the foreground, the rowboat being brought ashore in the middle ground, and the Sirius weighing anchor in the background.|$|E
5|$|Mating {{occurs on}} dry land, but the females {{return to the}} edge of the sea to release their fertilised eggs and then retreat back <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach.</b> The larvae that hatch are planktonic for 3–4 weeks, before {{settling}} to the sea floor, entering a gastropod shell and returning to dry land. Sexual maturity is reached after about 5 years, and the total lifespan may be over 60 years. In the 3–4 weeks that the larvae remain in the sea their chance of reaching another suitable location will be enhanced if they find a floating life support system. It is commonly agreed that floating logs or rafts of storm-struck vegetation would be suitable, although rather chancy and definitely seasonal. In contrast, floating coconuts can be a very significant part of the crab's dispersal options.|$|E
5|$|When sandhoppers (such as Talitrus saltator) {{are taken}} up a beach, they easily {{find their way}} {{back down to the}} sea. It has been shown that this is not simply by moving {{downhill}} or towards the sight or sound of the sea. A group of sandhoppers were acclimatised to a day/night cycle under artificial lighting, whose timing was gradually changed until it was 12 hours out of phase with the natural cycle. Then, the sandhoppers were placed on the beach in natural sunlight. They moved away from the sea, <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach.</b> The experiment implied that the sandhoppers use the sun and their internal clock to determine their heading, and that they had learnt the actual direction down to the sea on their particular beach.|$|E

5|$|The {{invasion}} {{plan called}} for two brigades of the 3rd Canadian Division to land on two beach sectors—Mike and Nan—focusing on Courseulles, Bernières and Saint-Aubin. It was hoped that the preliminary naval and air bombardments would soften <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> defences and destroy coastal strong points. Close support on the beaches was to be provided by amphibious tanks of the 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade. Once the landing zones were secured, the {{plan called for}} the 9th Canadian Infantry Brigade to land reserve battalions and deploy inland, the Royal Marine commandos to establish contact with the British 3rd Infantry Division on Sword and the 7th Canadian Infantry Brigade to link up with the British 50th Infantry Division on Gold. The 3rd Canadian Division's D-Day objectives were to capture Carpiquet Airfield and reach the Caen–Bayeux railway line by nightfall.|$|E
5|$|The zone where land meets sea {{is known}} as the coast and the part between the lowest spring tides and the upper limit reached by {{splashing}} waves is the shore. A beach is the accumulation of sand or shingle on the shore. A headland is a point of land jutting out into the sea and a larger promontory {{is known as}} a cape. The indentation of a coastline—especially between two headlands—is a bay; a small bay with a narrow inlet is a cove and a large bay or bay-shaped sea may be referred to as a gulf. Coastlines are influenced by a number of factors including the strength of the waves arriving on the shore, the gradient of the land margin, the composition and hardness of the coastal rock, the inclination of the off-shore slope, and the changes of the level of the land due to local uplift or submergence. Normally, waves roll towards the shore at the rate of six to eight per minute. These are known as constructive waves as they tend to move material <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> and have little erosive effect. Storm waves arrive on shore in rapid succession and are known as destructive waves, as their swash moves beach material seawards. Under their influence, the sand and shingle on the beach is ground together and abraded. Around high tide, the power of a storm wave impacting on the foot of a cliff has a shattering effect as air in cracks and crevices is compressed and then expands rapidly with release of pressure. At the same time, sand and pebbles have an erosive effect as they are thrown against the rocks. Along with other weathering processes such as frost, this tends to undercut the cliff. Gradually, a wave-cut platform develops {{at the foot of the}} cliff and this has a protective effect, reducing further wave-erosion.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{the growing}} {{popularity}} of Penarth beach and the need for better communications with Cardiff, in 1856 the Cardiff Steam and Navigation Company started a regular ferry service between Cardiff and Penarth. This continued until 1903. Boats were loaded and unloaded at Penarth using a landing stage on wheels which was hauled <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach.</b>|$|E
25|$|To {{land the}} cannon onto Tybee Island, {{artillery}} pieces were taken off transports, set on rafts at high tide, and pitched into the surf near shore. At low tide, manpower alone would drag the guns <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach.</b> Two {{hundred and fifty}} men were required to move a 13-inch mortar along on a sling cart. Later Union amphibious operations would employ contraband labor {{for much of this}} work. Along the two-and-a-half mile front, their engineers had to construct almost a mile of corduroy road made of bundles of brushwood to keep the guns from sinking into the swamp. While offloading proceeded day and night according to the tides, Confederate bombardment from Fort Pulaski gunners required all Federal movement into the island limited to night time. After a month of work, 36 mortars, heavy guns and rifled cannon were in position.|$|E
25|$|Alleyways {{leading down}} to the Thames became the only {{practical}} way to cross over the river via boat as Old London Bridge was frequently blocked. Wharves and latter rudimentary docks began {{to be used to}} offload goods but most ships simply moored in lines {{in the middle of the}} river and their cargo was rowed to shore and carried up shoreline stairs. Some of the Thames original shoreline did remain free from the construction of houses or walls. The access to the river was via, shore, gaps between houses used to launch boats. Samuel Pepys in his diaries of 1665 mentions making landfall at Dukes Shore for example before wading <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> to Narrow Street. As late as the 1850s nearly all new bridges were built with stairs at both ends, and generally on both sides.|$|E

500|$|As waves {{approach}} {{land and}} move into shallow water, they change their behavior. If approaching at an angle, waves may bend (refraction) or wrap rocks and headlands (diffraction). When the wave reaches a point where its deepest oscillations of the water contact the seabed, they begin to slow down. This pulls the crests closer together and increases the waves' height, which is called wave shoaling. When {{the ratio of the}} wave's height to the water depth increases above a certain limit, it [...] "breaks", toppling over in a mass of foaming water. This rushes in a sheet <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> before retreating into the sea under the influence of gravity.|$|E
500|$|As Ichiki's troops regrouped {{east of the}} creek, Japanese mortars bombarded the Marine lines. [...] The Marines {{answered}} with 75mm artillery barrages and mortar fire into the areas east of the creek. At about 05:00, another wave of Japanese troops attacked, this time attempting to flank the Marine positions by wading through the ocean surf and attacking <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> into the west bank area of the creek bed. The Marines responded with heavy machine gun and artillery fire along the beachfront area, again causing heavy casualties among Ichiki's attacking troops and causing them to abandon their attack and withdraw back to the east bank of the creek. [...] For {{the next couple of}} hours, the two sides exchanged rifle, machine gun, and artillery fire at close range across the sandbar and creek.|$|E
500|$|Despite causing damage {{along the}} East Coast, {{the storm is}} best known for causing a record number of {{maritime}} incidents. Numerous ships were caught in the storm from October30, when the steamship Claribel reported gale-force winds, to November6, when another steamship, the Australia, reported stormy weather. One ship, the brig Osseo, was caught in the storm on November1 and became flooded. Although the pumps were manned, the water level inside the ship soon reached [...] After being carried away by a wave, the distressed ship was spotted by the Camalia, which rescued the crew and brought them to port. Another vessel, the Wyonoka, spotted a sunken schooner with its five crew grasping the mast and ropes: they were also rescued. In addition, four ships were deemed total losses after being beached in Virginia. The first was the Mary D. Cranmer, which was ripped from its cables and stranded near Cape Henry. Shortly after the rescue of the crew of the Cranmer another ship, the Carrie Holmes, was found beached. The ship had been driven so far <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> that its crew were able to jump and wade to safety.|$|E

500|$|To {{the left}} of Dog Green sat Dog White, between the Vierville and Les Moulins strongpoints (defending draws D-1 and D-3); and here was a {{different}} story. As a result of earlier mis-landings, and now because of their own mis-landing, the troops of C/116 found themselves alone at Dog White, {{with a handful of}} tanks from the first wave in sight. The smoke from the grass fires covering their advance <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> they gained the seawall with few casualties, and were in better shape than any unit on the 116th RCT front so far. Although the 1st Battalion was effectively disarmed of its heavy weapons when D/116 suffered a disastrous landing, the buildup at Dog White continued. C/116 was joined by the 5th Ranger Battalion almost in its entirety. The Ranger commander, recognizing the situation at Dog Green on the run-in, ordered the assault craft to divert into Dog White. Like the C/116, the smoke covered their advance, although the 2nd Rangers were caught out on the right flank of the Ranger's landing. This was where the 116th RCT regimental command group, including the 29th Division assistant commander Brigadier General Norman [...] "Dutch" [...] Cota, was able to land relatively unscathed.|$|E
