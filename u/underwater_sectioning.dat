50|$|New to Monster Hunter 4 is {{movement}} and combat that places {{more emphasis on}} three-dimensional movement. Walls can be climbed more fluidly, and players can use height advantages to jump on and attack or even mount creatures. The game also eliminates <b>underwater</b> <b>sections</b> that were present in Monster Hunter 3. The monsters are terrain-aware and use the environment to their advantage. Two new weapons have been added: the Insect Glaive and the Charge Blade.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the more}} {{negative}} side, Jim Sterling of Destructoid gave the game a 5/10, stating that [...] "sticking to tradition {{has not worked}} in Nintendos favor" [...] and saying the new glider and <b>underwater</b> <b>sections</b> [...] "exist to provide the illusion of variety rather than actually altering the core experience". Giant Bomb scored the game a 3/5, noting [...] "your enjoyment of Mario Kart 7 will likely hinge on your continued appreciation of [...] formula".|$|R

5|$|The {{final element}} of the {{protection}} scheme of the first dreadnoughts was the subdivision of the ship below the waterline into several watertight compartments. If the hull were holed—by shellfire, mine, torpedo, or collision—then, in theory, only one area would flood and the ship could survive. To make this precaution even more effective, many dreadnoughts had no doors between different <b>underwater</b> <b>sections,</b> so that even a surprise hole below the waterline need not sink the ship. There were still several instances where flooding spread between underwater compartments.|$|R
5000|$|Giancarlo Saldana from Games Radar {{remained}} {{positive and}} praised the overall {{experience of the}} game even though he believed the underwater feature is a disappointment, as there are only limited diving spots - [...] "Though the <b>underwater</b> <b>sections</b> are lacking, the rest of Island Paradise is a great display of what The Sims 3 can still offer fans." [...] but states that the new features are a real highlight for the overall series - [...] "...the features it brings to the table are definitely {{some of the best}} the series has seen." ...|$|R
50|$|Because of the {{difficulties}} {{the construction of an}} <b>underwater</b> <b>section</b> would present, and the time it would require, it was planned in 1927 to link to line 10 an expansion of line 7 between Jussieu and Porte de Choisy that was already underway. With this in mind, it was decided to create a connection with two platforms between the stations Maubert of line 10 and Place Monge of the future line 7 such that line 10 borrowed this section of line 7 while the underwater tunnel that connected the northern and southern sections of the line was constructed.|$|R
50|$|The city of Paris {{decided in}} 1925 to connect three lines to line 10. To this end, many {{possibilities}} were examined. It was first envisioned {{to extend the}} line to Bastille via place Jussieu, to complement {{the creation of a}} circular line. However the abandonment of the creation of a circular line made this expansion of little use and would require an <b>underwater</b> <b>section</b> very close to one already planned for line 7 toward pont de Sully. Eventually, the city chose to limit the line to Jussieu on the rive gauche to create a connection with line 7.|$|R
50|$|The {{first true}} longship that was rowed was the Nydam ship, built in Denmark around 350 AD. It also had very rounded <b>underwater</b> <b>sections</b> but had more {{pronounced}} flare in the topsides, giving it more stability {{as well as}} keeping more {{water out of the}} boat at speed or in waves. It had no sail. It was of lapstrake construction fastened with iron nails. The bow and stern had slight elevation. The keel was a flattened plank about twice as thick as a normal strake plank but still not strong enough to withstand the downwards thrust of a mast.|$|R

5000|$|Located in Vyksa near Nizhny Novgorod, the Vyksa Steel Works are a {{division}} of the United Metallurgical Company. In 2005, the company began making a new line of single-seam 1420mm pipes for main gas pipelines. The Russian bank Sberbank lent the company [...] to support this effort. As of 2006, Vyksa was the largest Russian manufacturer of metal pipes. In 2007, the company became the only Russian pipe supplier to Nord Stream, providing piping for the construction of an <b>underwater</b> <b>section</b> of Nord Stream's pipeline under the Baltic Sea. In 2008, the company began to use epoxy anti-corrosion coatings on pipes for use in offshore oil wells and gas fields.|$|R

It displays {{the ratio of}} the immersed volume of the hull to a volume of a prism with equal length to the ship and cross-sectional area equal to the largest <b>underwater</b> <b>section</b> of the hull (midship section). This is used to evaluate the distribution of the volume of the underbody. A low or fine Cp indicates a full mid-section and fine ends, a high or full Cp indicates a boat with fuller ends. Planing hulls and other highspeed hulls tend towards a higher Cp. Efficient displacement hulls travelling at a low Froude number will tend to have a low Cp.|$|R
40|$|A new {{implementation}} of strip theory is proposed {{based on the}} strip theory by Salvesen, et al. [1] and early work by Westlake and Wilson [2]. Compared with traditional strip theory, the main {{difference is that the}} calculation is carried out in the time domain. This makes it possible to cope with relatively large-amplitude motions and non-constant forward speed problems. At each time step, the exact <b>underwater</b> <b>sections</b> are extracted; the velocity potential is required to satisfythis instantaneous body boundary condition, therefore the added mass, damping coefficients and exciting forces are timevariant, which produce a non-linearity. The diffraction force is added to work ofWestlake and Wilson, and the results show the effect of diffraction force is significant...|$|R

25|$|In July, a more {{complete}} demo was made available to gaming websites, featuring platforming levels, space combat, racing, and <b>underwater</b> <b>sections.</b> Traveller's Tales explained the game's story had been written first, with concept art then designed by Rodney Matthews. The story was then broken down into different gameplay genres. Expert game designers for each genre were brought on board to develop each small section of the game. The main team of developers then took each of those sections and attempted to unify them into one seamless whole. This demo also revealed more of {{the capabilities of the}} game engine, which could depict heat distortions, particle effects, real-time light sourcing, shadows, and reflections, as well as the already revealed day and nights cycles and random weather effects.|$|R
5000|$|Several Build engine games (namely Shadow Warrior, Blood, and Redneck Rampage) worked {{around this}} by {{displaying}} a [...] "viewport" [...] to another sector through an additional rendering pass. This technique, called room-over-room (ROR), appears seamless to the player. In {{addition to an}} expanded range of vertical construction, ROR was often used to give bodies of water translucent surfaces. ROR was never {{a feature of the}} Build engine itself, but rather a [...] "trick" [...] that was created by game developers. A trick used in Duke Nukem 3D to get around this, {{as in the case of}} its opaque <b>underwater</b> <b>sections,</b> was to simply transport the player quickly to another region of the map made to mimic it, similar to the elevators from Rise of the Triad.|$|R

He acknowledged that the controls are imperfect but said they become easier with practice. GamePros brief review, however, argued that [...] "Battlemorph provides below-average terrain-skimming shooting in a typical polygon environment and features really poor control. While the tunnel and underwater areas refresh this tedious game, the dismal one-color landscapes are the same as those in half of the Jaguar games out there." ...|$|R

40|$|Recent icebreaking ships {{need to be}} {{designed}} to enhance not only icebreaking capability but also turning ability. For the evaluation of ice resistance induced by an icebreaking hull form, HHI (Hyundai Heavy Industries) has developed the hybrid empirical formulas (Park et al., 2015) by considering the geometrical hull shape features, such as waterline and <b>underwater</b> <b>sections.</b> However, the empirical formulas have inherent limits to the precise estimation of the icebreaking and turning ability because the breaking process and the resulting pattern are ignored. For this reason, numerical calculation in time domain is performed to predict the icebreaking process and pattern. In the simulation, varying crushing stress according to velocity vectors and contact areas between hull and ice is newly introduced. Moreover, the simulation results were verified by comparing them with the model test results for three different bow-first icebreaking models...|$|R

The reviewer especially highlighted the last mission due to its <b>underwater</b> <b>sections,</b> as it requires players to find hidden air pockets so that Bond can breath and stay alive. In contrast, Mark Green of N64 Magazine remarked that the missions were fairly scripted, limiting the player's options and experimentation. Similarly, Edge said that the game's [...] "on the fly" [...] mission objectives give the game {{a fair amount of}} rigidity.

Coal bunkers were located over the armoured deck and surrounded by 4 ft compartments filled with cork. The ship had bunker capacity for 400 tons of coal below the deck for use during combat, when the above-deck bunkers would be inaccessible and possibly flooded. The structure above the armoured deck also contained a large number of watertight compartments to further preserve buoyancy. There was also light superstructure to provide crew accommodation, and freeboard in rough weather, although anticipated to be seriously damaged in any major engagement.|$|R
