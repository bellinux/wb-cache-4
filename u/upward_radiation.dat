The fields are compatible with known meteorological regimes of atmospheric water vapor content and cloudiness.

Areas of low net <b>upward</b> longwave <b>radiation</b> flux ((less than 40 /sq Wm) are the tropical convective regions and extra tropical regions that tend to have persistent low cloud cover. The technique used relies on General Circulation Model simulations and so is subject to some of the uncertainties associated with the model.

It is concluded that surface folding caused by compressive stresses, crustal foundering due to tensile fracturing and density inversions, and local turbulence may result in regularly spaced surface ridges periodically interrupted by upwellings of liquid sulfur onto the frozen surface of the flow. The model suggests that although the color of the surface crust of a quickly quenched sulfur flow will not necessarily reflect the local internal temperature of the flow, diapiric upwellings and convection from beneath this crust should indicate the progressive cooling of the inner, more fluid zones of the flow...|$|E

Several connections between the irradiation and other meteorological parameters over a maize field have been found.

A period of nearly 30 minutes with reduced turbulence regime after the totality was found. Using a wavelet transformation for the time series, a change of time scales from longer to shorter ones was observed before the totality, and after the turbulence increased in the short time scales.

40|$|The {{thermodynamic}} {{exchanges of}} the old city center of Marseilles during a summer period are analyzed with the SOLENE thermo-radiative model, using measurements of the UBL-ESCOMPTE experimental campaign in June–July 2001. The selected scene is an actual fragment of the urban canopy composed of 4 streets at right angles, with various 19 th century houses and yards. The SOLENE software’s ability to simulate the heat and radiation exchanges of this urban district with the atmosphere is first evaluated by comparing simulation outputs with surface temperatures of individual roof and façade elements measured by infrared radiation thermometers and with integrated fluxes measured on top of a neighboring meteorological mast. This model assessment is reinforced by a sensitivity study to the interior building temperature, a variable of possible influence which is usually not measured in studies at the scale of an urban fragment or district. The flux sensor position influence on the comparison is also studied by introducing a virtual sensor in the simulated scene. The software is further used to analyze the behavior of individual surface elements of the scene with various orientations during a typical summer diurnal cycle.

The ability to simulate the surface energy balance and the microclimate within the plant canopy is contingent upon accurate simulation of the surface radiation exchange. A validation exercise was conducted of the Simultaneous Heat and Water (SHAW) model for simulating the surface radiation exchange (including downward long-wave and upward short- and long-wave radiation) over a maize canopy surface using data collected at Yucheng in the North China Plain. The model simulated upward short-wave and net all-wave radiation well with model efficiencies (ME) equaling 0. 97 and 0. 98, respectively. Downward and <b>upward</b> long-wave <b>radiation</b> were overestimated by 12. 1 and 8. 3 W m - 2 with ME equaling 0. 68 and 0. 89, respectively. Two modifications to the model were implemented and tested to improve the simulated long-wave radiation exchange. In one modification, alternative schemes were tested to simulate cloudy sky long-wave radiation, and the best algorithm was employed in the model. With this modification, both downward and <b>upward</b> long-wave <b>radiation</b> were simulated better, with ME rising to 0. 88 and 0. 91, respectively. A second modification was implemented to use leaf temperature rather than canopy air temperature to compute emitted long-wave radiation. Although more theoretically correct, this modification did not improve simulations compared to the original model because <b>upward</b> long-wave <b>radiation</b> was already overpredicted and midday leaf temperatures at this site were typically higher than canopy air temperatures. Thus, the modification resulted in even higher overprediction of <b>upward</b> midday long-wave <b>radiation.</b> However, this modification removed some of the bias in nighttime emitted long-wave radiation. While the SHAW model simulates the radiation balance and transfer processes within the canopy reasonably well, results point to areas for model improvement...|$|R

40|$|Retrieval of {{biogeochemical}} parameters from remotely sensed data in optically complex waters such {{as those}} found in coastal zones is a challenging task due {{to the effects of}} various water constituents (biogenic, nonalgal and inorganic particles, dissolved matter) on the radiation exiting the ocean. Since scattering by molecules, aerosols, hydrosols and reflection at the sea surface introduce and modify the polarization state of light, the polarized <b>upward</b> <b>radiation</b> contains embedded information about the intrinsic nature of aerosols and suspended matter in the ocean. In this study, shipborne above water angularly resolved visible/near infrared multiband measurements of the degree of polarization are analysed against their corresponding in-situ biogeochemically characterized water samples for the first time. Water samples and radiometric data were collected in the English Channel along an inshore-offshore transect. Angular variations in the degree of polarization P are found to be consistent with theory. Maximum values of P are observed near the Brewster viewing angle in the specular direction. Variations in the degree of polarization at the Brewster angle (PB) with water content revealed that the suspended particulate matter, which is mainly composed of inorganic particles during the experiment, contributes to depolarise the skylight reflection, thus reducing PB. An empirical polarization-based approach is proposed to determine biogeochemical properties of the particles. The concentration of inorganic particles can be estimated using PB to within ± 13 % based on the dataset used. Larger sets of polarized measurements are recommended to corroborate the tendency observed in this study...|$|E
40|$|A {{procedure}} for ocean areas {{has been developed}} to detect ice clouds with optical depths of at least 0, 05 from backscattered solar radiation. In addition, the procedure is able to estimate the optical depth of the ice cloud with relative errors smaller than 10 %. These results stay valid for the general case with varying aerosol contents and/or multiple cloud layer conditions. That means, that measurements of the spectral <b>upward</b> <b>radiation</b> in the solar region allow to separate pure ice clouds from ice clouds above water clouds. For cases of pure ice clouds a simultaneous estimation of an effective radius is possible. Certainly, this estimation shows large errors for optical depths smaller than 0, 5 but errors reduce to smaller than 10 % for optical depths of at least 1, 0. To apply this method, an assumption {{has to be made}} about the mean effective crystal shape, or at least about the asymmetry parameter. This information can not be determined from spectral measurements. Either instruments with multiangle capabilities allow an estimation or a distorted polycrystal should be assumed. Different published studies as well as the results of the analyzed measurements confirm this assumption. All investigated spectral channels are available on present satellite systems or at least replaceable with similar channels. From that point of view there seems to be the capability to generalize the introduced procedures for satellite applications. (orig.) 113 refs.

40|$|A physical-statistical {{approach}} to simulate cloud structures and their <b>upward</b> <b>radiation</b> over the Mediterranean is described. It aims {{to construct a}} synthetic database of microwave passive observations matching the climatological conditions of this geographical region. The synthetic database is conceived to train a Bayesian maximum a postetioti probability inversion scheme to retrieve precipitating cloud parameters from spaceborne microwave radiometric data. The initial microphysical a priori information on vertical profiles of cloud parameters is derived from a mesoscale cloud-resolving model. In order to complement information from cloud models and to match simulations to {{the conditions of the}} area of interest, a new approach is proposed. Climatological constraints over the Mediterranean are derived on a monthly basis from available radiosounding profiles, rain-gauge network measurements, and colocated METEOSAT infrared measurements. In order to introduce the actual surface background in the radiative-transfer simulations, a further constraint is represented by the monthly average and variance maps of surface emissivity derived from Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) clear-air observations. A validation of the forward model is carried out by comparing a large set of brightness temperatures measured by the SSM/I with the synthetic cloud radiative database to asses its representativeness and range of variability. The marginal contribution of each constraint source, used in the matching process, is also evaluated. Finally, surface rain rates, retrieved from SSM/I data using the new synthetic database, are compared with colocated rain rates measured by a rain-gauge network along the Tiber River basin in Italy throughout 1995. This comparison is performed both for selected case studies and in a statistical way, discussing the major advantages and limitations of the proposed approach...|$|E

The projected surface air temperature reveals that even in a climate warmer than that at present, extremely low daily minimum temperatures in early summer are comparable to those in the present climate at several locations. At locations where future low temperatures are remarkable, the temperature drop at night is larger in the future than at present. This temperature drop results from mainly two heat fluxes: <b>upward</b> longwave <b>radiation</b> and latent heat flux. In the future climate, <b>upward</b> longwave <b>radiation</b> increases owing to high temperature at the surface around the time of the sunset. In addition, the upward flux of latent heat increases owing to low relative humidity just above the surface.

It determines the proportion of solar energy absorbed by the surface and reflected back to the atmosphere. The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) identified surface albedo among key factors influencing climate radiative forcing. Accurate knowledge of surface reflective properties is important for advancing weather forecasting and climate change impact studies. It is also important for determining radiative impact and acceptable levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which makes this work strongly linked to major scientific objectives of the Climate Change Research Division (CCRD) and Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program. Most significant accomplishments of eth project are listed below. I) Surface albedo/BRDF datasets from 1995 {{to the end of}} 2004 have been produced.

40|$|Significant {{fraction}} of matter in supercritical (or super-Eddington) accretion flow is {{blown away by}} radiation force, thus forming outflows, however, the properties of such radiation-driven outflows have been poorly understood. We have performed global two-dimensional radiaion-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of supercritical accretion flow onto a black hole with 10 or 10 ^ 8 solar masses in a large simulation box of 514 r_S x 514 r_S (with r_S being the Schwarzschild radius). We confirm that uncollimated outflows with velocities of 10 percents {{of the speed of}} light emerge from the innermost part of the accretion flow over wide angles of 10 - 50 degree from the disk rotation axis. Importantly, the outflows exhibit clumpy structure above heights of ~ 250 r_S. The typical size of the clumps is ~ 10 r_S, which corresponds to one optical depth, and their shapes are slightly elongated along the outflow direction. Since clumps start to form in the layer above which (<b>upward)</b> <b>radiation</b> force overcomes (downward) gravity force, Rayleigh-Taylor instability seems to be of primary cause. In addition, a radiation hydrodynamic instability, which arises when radiation funnels through radiation-pressure supported atmosphere, may also help forming clumps of one optical depth. Magnetic photon bubble instability seems not to be essential, since similar clumpy outflow structure is obtained in non-magnetic radiation-hydrodynamic simulations. Since the spatial covering factor of the clumps is estimated to be ~ 0. 3 and since they are marginally optically thick, they will explain at least some of rapid light variations of active galactic nuclei. We further discuss a possibility of producing broad-line clouds by the clumpy outflow. Comment: 11 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in PAS...|$|E

We have studied the effect of clouds on the surface radiation budget and {{have found that the}} long wave (LW) greenhouse effect of clouds exceeded the short wave (SW) albedo effect of clouds, so that net (SW+LW) cloud-radiative forcing on the snow surface was heating. The heating mechanism is explained as follows : (1) Short wave : The downward short wave radiation on a cloudy day is only slightly less than on a clear day due to the multi-reflection effect between cloud and snow surface. On the other hand, there is no significant difference of snow albedo between clear and cloudy days. Therefore, the net radiation on a cloudy day does not largely decrease from that on a clear day. That is, SW cloud-radiative forcing is only weak cooling. (2) Long wave : The downward long wave radiation on a cloudy day increases from that on a clear day, because of additional emission from the cloud. In addition, since the air temperature is very low and the water vapor contained in the atmosphere is very little on a clear day, the equivalent black body temperature of the {{downward radiation}} is very low so that the difference of downward radiation between clear and cloudy days is large. On the other hand, the difference of <b>upward</b> <b>radiation</b> between clear and cloudy days is not so large.

Direct solar radiation was also measured at the snow surface. The spectral measurements of shortwave radiation divided into four wavelength regions were made. Sensitivity constants of the pyranometers used for the measurement of global and reflected radiations showed large deviation from the cosine law response at a low solar elevation. Field calibration of the pyranometers was made extensively and some realistic equation to derive the global radiation under a broken sky from several calibration factors was proposed. As for the longwave radiation measurements, the pyrgeometer was equipped with a simple shading ring in order to eliminate the heating effect of the hemispherical dome due to solar radiation. Diurnal and seasonal variations of radiation components are shown and those of the net radiation are also given. Daily totals of the net radiation remain negative even in the summer for the clear sky, on account of high albedo of the snow surface and large <b>upward</b> longwave <b>radiation</b> compared with the downward.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{aerosols}} on the thermal infrared radiation {{can be assessed}} by combining observations and radiative transfer calculations. Both have uncertainties, which are discussed in this paper. Observational uncertainties are obtained for two FTIR instruments operated {{side by side on}} the ground during the LACE 1998 field campaign. Radiative transfer uncertainties are assessed using a line-by-line model taking into account the uncertainties of the HITRAN 2004 spectroscopic database, uncertainties in the determination of the atmospheric profiles of water vapor and ozone, and differences in the treatment of the water vapor continuum absorption by the CKD 2. 4. 1 and MT_CKD 1. 0 algorithms. The software package OPAC was used to describe the optical properties of aerosols for climate modeling. The corresponding radiative signature is a guideline to the assessment of the uncertainty ranges of observations and models. We found that the detection of aerosols depends strongly on the measurement accuracy of atmospheric profiles of water vapor and ozone and is easier for drier conditions. Within the atmospheric window, only the forcing of downward radiation at the surface by desert aerosol emerges clearly from the uncertainties of modeling and FTIR measurement. Urban and polluted continental aerosols are only partially detectable depending on the wave number and on the atmospheric water vapor amount. Simulations for the space-borne interferometer IASI show that only <b>upward</b> <b>radiation</b> above transported mineral dust aloft emerges out of the uncertainties. The detection of aerosols with weak radiative impact by FTIR instruments like ARIES and OASIS is made difficult by noise as demonstrated by the signal to noise ratio for clean continental aerosols.

40|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{energy budget}} is often adopted by previous studies {{to explore the}} balance between energy sources/sinks and the divergence of atmospheric energy flux. Because the atmospheric circulation is essentially generated by the energy balance between sources and sinks, a better knowledge of an energy budget {{will lead to a}} better understanding of the atmospheric circulation and its variations.;Climatologically, the polar regions are the major sink regions of global energy. The energy in the polar regions undergoes interannual and 30 - 60 day variations. It was inferred from previous studies dealing with the poleward propagation of angular momentum that energy exhibits a propagating signature, originating from the tropics and extending into the polar regions, on the interannual and 30 - 60 day timescales. To gain a new perspective on the polar energy change, the polar energy budget was studied in this thesis, based on a hypothesis that the low-latitude atmospheric energy with poleward propagation could indirectly affect the divergence of energy flux, and, in turn, affect the variations of the polar energy budget. In addition, polar climate changes (e. g., precipitation) associated with the energy propagation were also studied.;Results indicated that the energy changes in the polar regions and the tropics are remotely linked through the poleward propagation of energy relay carried out by different types of circulation patterns at different latitudes, as the propagation of angular momentum depicted by previous studies. Analyses have pointed out that the propagation of energy is led by the divergence of energy flux with a horizontal quadrature shift between the former and the latter. After a larger (smaller) energy propagates into the polar regions, the polar energy budget is changed by an increase (decrease) of energy transport into the polar regions. On the other hand, it was found that the increase (decrease) of energy flux converging into the polar regions is balanced by an increase (decrease) of downward surface flux and <b>upward</b> <b>radiation</b> flux at the top of the atmosphere over the polar regions. Associated with this energy balance, the polar climate changes include a reduced (increased) precipitation and an increased (reduced) outgoing longwave radiation. Maintenance of these changes were discussed...|$|E
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of a large urban meteorology program recently launched in Canada, the Montreal Urban Snow Experiment (MUSE) campaign has been conducted in order to document the thermoradiative exchanges in a densely built-up area of Montreal in late winter and spring conditions. The targeted period is of particular scientific interest because it covers the transition period from a mainly snow-covered urban environment to a mainly snow-free environment. The campaign is based on four weeks of observations from 17 March to 14 April 2005. It couples automatic and continuous measurements of radiation and turbulent fluxes, radiative surface temperatures, and air temperature and humidity with manual observations performed during intensive observation periods to supplement the surface temperature observations and to characterize the snow properties. The footprints of radiation and turbulent flux measurements are computed using the surface–sensor–sun urban model and the flux-source area model, respectively. The analysis of the radiometer footprint underscores the difficulty of correctly locating this type of instrument in urban environments, so that the sensor sees a representative combination of the urban and nonurban surfaces. Here, the alley contribution to the <b>upward</b> <b>radiation</b> tends to be overestimated {{to the detriment of the}} road contribution. The turbulent footprints cover homogeneous zones in terms of surface characteristics, whatever the wind direction. The initial analysis of the energy balance displays the predominance of the residual term (QRes = Q* − QH − QE) in comparison with the turbulent sensible (QH) and latent (QE) heat fluxes, since its daytime contribution exceeds 50 % of the net radiation (Q*). The investigation of energy balances observed at the beginning and at the end of the experiment (i. e., with and without snow) also indicates that the snow plays a significant role in the flux partitioning and the daily pattern of fluxes. Without snow, the energy balance is characteristic of energy balances that have been already observed in densely built-up areas, notably because of the hysteresis observed for QRes and QH in relation to Q* and because of the high contribution of QRes, which includes the effect of heat storage inside the urban structures. With snow, the flux partitioning is modified by the snowmelt process leading to contributions of the residual term and latent heat flux, which are larger than in the case without snow to the detriment of the sensible heat flux...|$|E

A direct {{insertion}} technique is developed to assimilate snow albedo into Noah and is applied to three intensive study areas in North Park (Colorado) {{that are part of}} the 2002 / 03 Cold Land Processes Field Experiment (CLPX). The assimilated snow albedo products are 1) the standard Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) product (MOD 10 A 1) and 2) retrievals from MODIS observations with the recently developed Pattern-Based Semiempirical (PASS) approach. The performance of the Noah simulations, with and without assimilation, is evaluated using the in situ measurements of snow albedo, <b>upward</b> shortwave <b>radiation,</b> and snow depth. The results show that simulations with albedo assimilation agree better with the measurements. However, because of the limited impact of snow albedo updates after subsequent snowfall, the mean (or seasonal) error statistics decrease significantly for only two of the three CLPX sites.

The model includes a mixed-layer ocean model, a multi-layer snow/ice model, and the interfaces among atmosphere, snow/sea ice, and sea water. The observational {{data from the}} measurements at the ice station of the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) field experiment between November 1997 and January 1998 were used to drive and validate the model. The energy budget of the stand-alone simulations shows that the longwave radiative cooling is mainly balanced by the heat released of freezing {{at the bottom of}} the sea-ice. The results also show that the effect of ventilation and blowing snow are required to reproduce the detailed observed surface temperature, thickness of the sea ice, sensible heat flux and <b>upward</b> longwave <b>radiation...</b>|$|R
40|$|The total {{solar eclipse}} of 11 August 1999 over Central Europe was also visible in Baden-Wuerttemberg, {{a state in}} {{south-west}} Germany. To investigate {{the impact of the}} total solar eclipse on the lower planetary boundary layer, meteorological and air quality data extracted from routine measurements at six sites in Baden-Wuerttemberg were examined. The meteorological data were recorded at the Plittersdorf meteorological station (in the path of totality of the total solar eclipse) and at the Forest meteorological Site Hartheim (outside the path of totality of the total solar eclipse). The air quality data were obtained from four official air quality monitoring stations located at Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-West, Rastatt and Welzheimer Wald, all of which lie within the path of totality of the total solar eclipse. Due to cloudiness, weather conditions on 11 August 1999 were not optimal in south-west Germany. However, the transient reduction (followed by a rise) induced by the total solar eclipse on meteorological variables including global solar <b>radiation,</b> <b>upward</b> longwave <b>radiation,</b> net radiation, air temperature, horizontal wind speed, elevation angle of the three-dimensional wind vector as well as turbulent sensible and latent heat fluxes was quite obvious. Despite unfavourable weather conditions, half-hourly mean values of ozone routinely measured at the above-mentioned standard official air quality monitoring stations showed a varying decline up to 27 % at the urban station Rastatt and 37 % at the background station Welzheimer Wald. This decline was owing mainly to the fall in global radiation during the total solar eclipse. However, additional influences by advection and deposition can not be precluded...|$|R
40|$|Tsuyama basin is {{the largest}} basin in the Chugoku District, and dense fog appears {{frequently}} in autumn/winter. The fog is considered as "radiation fog", mainly induced by radiation cooling and topographical effect as the basin, including "cold air lake". The mechanism of the fog was not studied based on field measurements. Some statistical analyses {{are found in the}} literature. So we made intensive observation of the radiation fog mainly focusing on space and time distribution for the fog appearance and disappearance. The field measurement included tethered sonde observation, mobile observation and multi-point visual observations in October, 1999 and November, 2000. According to the observation, the appearance of the fog was identified both feom visual observation and upper air sounding data. The top of the fog layer was clearly found as temperature/humidity singularities. Additionally, it is successfully confirmed the usefulness of the <b>upward</b> looking <b>radiation</b> thermometer in the fog detection...|$|R
40|$|Possible {{atmospheric}} effects associated with pre-seismic variations of atmospheric radon concentration occasionally observed prior to earthquake occurrence {{are subjected to}} theoretical study {{in order to assess}} their potential effectiveness. Altitude distribution of atmospheric conductivity is examined as a function of radon and aerosol concentrations. Horizontal components of atmospheric electric fields and currents, which can arise near a boundary of seismo-active region, are estimated. We speculated that changes in radon-induced air ionization can have an impact on fair-weather spectra of ULF electric pulsations. Particular emphasis has been placed on hypothesis for correlation between variations of pre-seismic radon activity and <b>upward</b> thermal <b>radiation</b> measured by satellite over the high seismicity regions. This hypothesis is based on assumption that the radon-induced ionization of atmospheric surface layer can trigger water vapor condensation which in turn results in release of the vaporization heat. Our analysis has shown that the upward thermal flux has to be many orders of magnitude lower than that predicted {{on the basis of this}} hypothesis...|$|R
