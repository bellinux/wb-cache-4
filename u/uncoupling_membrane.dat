We addressed a potential involvement of mitochondria in GA toxicity (1 – 25 μM) toward cancer cells by employing both hepatic carcinoma (HepG 2) cells and succinate-energized mitochondria, isolated from rat liver. In HepG 2 cells GA decreased viability, dissipated mitochondrial membrane potential, depleted ATP and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. In isolated rat-liver mitochondria GA promoted membrane fluidity increase, cyclosporine A/EGTA-insensitive membrane permeabilization, <b>uncoupling</b> (<b>membrane</b> potential dissipation/state 4 respiration rate increase), Ca 2 + efflux, ATP depletion, NAD(P) H depletion/oxidation and ROS levels increase. All effects in cells, except mitochondrial membrane potential dissipation, as well as NADPH depletion/oxidation and permeabilization in isolated mitochondria, were partly prevented by the a NAD(P) H regenerating substrate isocitrate. The results suggest the following sequence of events: 1) GA interaction with mitochondrial membrane promoting its permeabilization; 2) mitochondrial membrane potential dissipation; 3) NAD(P) H oxidation/depletion due to inability of membrane potential-sensitive NADP+ transhydrogenase of sustaining its reduced state; 4) ROS accumulation inside mitochondria and cells; 5) additional mitochondrial membrane permeabilization due to ROS; and 6) ATP depletion.

40|$|Bax-induced permeabilization of the {{mitochondrial}} outer membrane {{and release}} of cytochrome c are key events in apoptosis. Although Bax can compromise mitochondria in primitive unicellular organisms that lack a classical apoptotic machinery, {{it is still}} unclear if Bax alone is sufficient for this, or whether additional mitochondrial components are required. The protozoan parasite Giardia lamblia {{is one of the}} earliest branching eukaryotes and harbors highly degenerated mitochondrial remnant organelles (mitosomes) that lack a genome. Here we tested whether human Bax expressed in Giardia can be used to ablate mitosomes. We demonstrate that these organelles are neither targeted, nor compromised, by Bax. However, specialized compartments of the regulated secretory pathway are completely ablated by Bax. As a consequence, maturing cyst wall proteins that are sorted into these organelles are released into the cytoplasm, causing a developmental arrest and cell death. Interestingly, this ectopic cargo release is dependent on the carboxy-terminal 22 amino acids of Bax, and can be prevented by the Bax-inhibiting peptide Ku 70. A C-terminally truncated Bax variant still localizes to secretory organelles, but is unable to permeabilize these membranes, <b>uncoupling</b> <b>membrane</b> targeting and cargo release. Even though mitosomes are too diverged to be recognized by Bax, off-target membrane permeabilization appears to be conserved and leads to cell death completely independently of mitochondria...|$|E

The morphological appearance of the particles is not affected by a variety of buffers, by changes in illumination or temperature, or by alterations in the energy state of the membranes during preparation. The particles can be removed from the membranes with low concentrations of Na 2 EDTA, and the photophosphorylating activity of the membranes is concomitantly lost.

50|$|This gene is {{a member}} of the {{mitochondrial}} carrier subfamily of solute carrier protein genes. The product of this gene, adenine nucleotide translocator 2 (ANT2), functions as a major constituent of the mitochondrial permeability-transition pore complex that catalyzes the exchange of mitochondrial ATP with cytosolic ADP. As a result of its antiporter function, ANT2 maintains mitochondrial membrane potential by regulating ADP/ATP ratios in oxidative phosphorylation. ANT2 facilitates uncoupling of the mitochondrial membrane when acylated by SIRT4. Though <b>uncoupling</b> the <b>membrane</b> potential typically leads to apoptosis, ANT2 was found to be antiapoptotic. As a result, it is postulated to mediate the TFIIH-dependent response to DNA damage as a component of the MMS19-XPD. Alternatively, suppressing the expression of this gene has been shown to induce apoptosis and inhibit tumor growth.|$|R

The precise {{mechanism by which}} the bacterial SRP receptor, FtsY, interacts with and is regulated at the target membrane remain unclear. Here, quantitative analysis of FtsY-lipid interactions at single-molecule resolution revealed a two-step mechanism in which FtsY initially contacts membrane via a Dynamic mode, followed by an SRP-induced conformational transition to a Stable mode that activates FtsY for downstream steps. Importantly, mutational analyses revealed extensive auto-inhibitory mechanisms that prevent free FtsY from engaging membrane in the Stable mode; an engineered FtsY pre-organized into the Stable mode led to indiscriminate targeting in vitro and disrupted FtsY function in vivo.

The domain of the projection of the membrane on the xy plane is decomposed into non-overlapping subdomains and the membrane problem is solved sequentially in each subdomain starting from zero displacements on the virtual boundaries. The procedure is repeated until the traction continuity conditions are also satisfied on the virtual boundaries. The membrane problem in each subdomain is solved using the Analog Equation Method (AEM).

40|$|Secretion {{of hormones}} and {{peptides}} by neuroendocrine cells occurs through fast and slow modes of vesicle fusion but {{the mechanics of}} these processes are not understood. We used interference reflection microscopy to monitor deformations of the membrane surface and found that both modes of fusion involve the tightly coupled dilation and constriction of the vesicle. The rate of opening is calcium dependent and occurs rapidly at concentrations < 5 μM. The fast mode of fusion is blocked selectively by a truncation mutant of amphiphysin. Vesicles do not collapse when fusion is triggered by strontium, rather they remain locked open and membrane scission is blocked. In contrast, constriction of the vesicle opening continues when endocytosis is blocked by inhibiting the function of dynamin. Thus, fast and slow modes of fusion involve similar membrane deformations and vesicle closure can be <b>uncoupled</b> from <b>membrane</b> scission. Regulation of these processes by calcium and amphiphysin may provide a mechanism for controlling the release of vesicle contents...|$|R

This coupling is maintained following adrenergic stimulation of oxygenated red cells when the increased NTP demands of ion transporting systems are met by enhanced energy production via aerobic metabolism. In unstimulated anoxic red cells, membranemetabolic coupling is preserved via the arrest of NTP-consuming processes. Adrenergic stimulation of anoxic red cells, however, leads to a functional <b>uncoupling</b> of <b>membrane</b> metabolism {{with the result that}} NTP levels decline rapidly.

40|$|The pore-forming {{mechanism}} of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs) exhibits an absolute requirement for membrane cholesterol. The structural elements of the CDCs that mediate this interaction are not well understood. Three short hydrophobic loops (L 1 –L 3) and a highly conserved undecapeptide sequence {{at the tip of}} domain 4 of the CDC structure are known to anchor the CDC to the membrane. It has been thought that the undecapeptide directly mediates the interaction of the CDCs with a cholesterol-rich cell surface. Herein we show that the L 1 –L 3 loops, not the undecapeptide, are responsible for mediating the specific interaction of the CDCs with cholesterol-rich membranes. The membrane insertion of the undecapeptide was <b>uncoupled</b> from <b>membrane</b> binding by the covalent modification of the undecapeptide cysteine thiol. Modification of the cysteine prevented prepore to pore conversion, but did not affect membrane binding, thus demonstrating that undecapeptide membrane insertion follows that of the L 1 –L 3 loops.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{relative}} hydrophobicity {{and interaction}} of flavonoids with artificial membranes using vesicles was studied. At {{the same degree}} of hydroxylation, flavones were slightly more hydrophobic than flavanones. Flavonoids possess a hydrophobic character and are weak acids. For this reason, their uncoupling efficiency of the membrane potential was studied using cytochrome c oxidase vesicles. With emphasis on naringenin, it was shown that flavonoids affect both the transmembrane potential difference (V) and the transmembrane pH difference (V). Flavones were slightly more effective in <b>uncoupling</b> the <b>membrane</b> potential than flavanones; the 7 OH group seems to play an important role. Hydroxylation of the exocyclic phenyl group decreased the uncoupling efficiency for all flavonoids studied. The flavonol quercitin exhibited hardly any uncoupling activity. Glycosylation abolished all uncoupling activity. The affinity of flavonoids for vesicle membranes was also studied using the fluorescence quenching of the membrane probe diphenylhexatriene. Flavonols exhibited a substantially higher affinity for liposomes than flavanones. This difference in affinity is assumed to be caused by the far more planar configuration of the flavonols in comparison with the tilted configuration of flavanones. Due to this planar configuration, it seems reasonable to assume that flavonols could more easily intercalate into the organised structures of the phospholipids within the vesicle membranes than flavanones. It is concluded that, in vivo, hardly any uncoupling activity of flavonoids can be anticipated...|$|R

40|$|Leading edge {{protrusion}} of migrating cells involves tightly coordinated {{changes in}} the plasma membrane and actin cytoskeleton. It remains unclear whether polymerizing actin filaments push and deform the membrane, or membrane deformation occurs independently and is subsequently stabilized by actin filaments. To address this question, we employed an ability of the membrane-binding I-BAR domain of IRSp 53 to <b>uncouple</b> the <b>membrane</b> and actin dynamics and to induce filopodia in expressing cells. Using time-lapse imaging and electron microscopy of IRSp 53 -I-BAR-expressing B 16 F 1 melanoma cells, we demonstrate that cells {{are not able to}} protrude or maintain durable long extensions without actin filaments in their interior, but I-BAR-dependent membrane deformation can create a small and transient space at filopodial tips that is subsequently filled with actin filaments. Moreover, the expressed I-BAR domain forms a submembranous coat that may structurally support these transient actin-free protrusions until they are further stabilized by the actin cytoskeleton. Actin filaments in the I-BAR-induced filopodia, in contrast to normal filopodia, do not have a uniform length, are less abundant, poorly bundled, and display erratic dynamics. Such unconventional structural organization and dynamics of actin in I-BAR-induced filopodia suggests that a typical bundle of parallel actin filaments is not necessary for generation and mechanical support of the highly asymmetric filopodial geometry.

When expressed in cultured mammalian cells, full-length mVps 24 p is cytosolic. However, when cells expressing the full-length mVps 24 p are co-transfected with a mutated form of mVps 4 p (which is defective in ATP hydrolysis), or when a N-terminal construct of mVps 24 p is expressed, the class-E cellular phenotype with swollen vacuoles is induced and mVps 24 p is membrane-associated. Furthermore, the accumulation of the N-terminal mVps 24 p construct on the swollen endosomal membranes is abrogated when phosphatidylinositol 3, 5 -bisphosphate synthesis is blocked with wortmannin. These data provide the first direct link between phosphatidylinositol 3, 5 -bisphosphate and the protein machinery involved in the production of the class-E cellular phenotype. We hypothesize that accumulation of Vps 24 on membranes occurs when membrane association (dependent on interaction of phosphatidylinositol 3, 5 -bisphosphate with the N-terminal domain of the protein) is <b>uncoupled</b> from <b>membrane</b> disassociation (driven by Vps 4 p) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} hydrophobicity {{and interaction}} of flavonoids with artificial membranes using vesicles was studied. At {{the same degree}} of hydroxylation, flavones were slightly more hydrophobic than flavanones. Flavonoids possess a hydrophobic character and are weak acids. For this reason, their uncoupling efficiency of the membrane potential was studied using cytochrome c oxidase vesicles. With emphasis on naringenin, it was shown that flavonoids affect both the transmembrane potential difference (V) and the transmembrane pH difference (V). Flavones were slightly more effective in <b>uncoupling</b> the <b>membrane</b> potential than flavanones; the 7 OH group seems to play an important role. Hydroxylation of the exocyclic phenyl group decreased the uncoupling efficiency for all flavonoids studied. The flavonol quercitin exhibited hardly any uncoupling activity. Glycosylation abolished all uncoupling activity. The affinity of flavonoids for vesicle membranes was also studied using the fluorescence quenching of the membrane probe diphenylhexatriene. Flavonols exhibited a substantially higher affinity for liposomes than flavanones. This difference in affinity is assumed to be caused by the far more planar configuration of the flavonols in comparison with the tilted configuration of flavanones. Due to this planar configuration, it seems reasonable to assume that flavonols could more easily intercalate into the organised structures of the phospholipids within the vesicle membranes than flavanones. It is concluded that, in vivo, hardly any uncoupling activity of flavonoids can be anticipated. However, the quercitin plasma concentration in vivo can be such that, based on the affinity study, part of this flavonol could be associated with biological membranes to function there as, for example, an antioxidant. ...|$|R
40|$|Thermoluminescence (TL) signals were {{recorded}} from grana stacks, margins, and stroma lamellae from fractionated, dark-adapted thylakoid membranes of spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) {{in the absence}} and {{in the presence of}} 2, 6 -dichlorphenylindophenol (DCMU). In the absence of DCMU, the TL signal from grana fractions consisted of a homogenous B-band, which originates from recombination of the semi-quinone QB− with the S 2 state of the water-splitting complex and reflects active photosystem II (PSII). In the presence of DCMU, the B-band was replaced by the Q-band, which originates from an S 2 QA− recombination. Margin fractions mainly showed two TL-bands, the B- and C-bands, at approximately 50 °C in the absence of DCMU, and Q- and C-bands in the presence of DCMU. The C-band is ascribed to a TyrD+-QA− recombination. In the absence of DCMU, the fractions of stromal lamellae mainly gave rise to a TL emission at 42 °C. The intensity of this band was independent of the number of excitation flashes and was shifted to higher temperatures (52 °C) after the addition of DCMU. Based on these observations, this band was considered to be a C-band. After photoinhibitory light treatment of <b>uncoupled</b> thylakoid <b>membranes,</b> the TL intensities of the B- and Q-bands decreased, whereas the intensity at 45 °C (C-band) slightly increased. It is proposed that the 42 to 52 °C band that was observed in marginal and stromal lamellae and in photoinhibited thylakoid membranes reflects inactive PSII centers that are assumed to be equivalent to inactive PSII QB-nonreducing centers...|$|R
40|$|The pentameric ligand gated {{ion channel}} super family plays {{a central role}} in fast {{synaptic}} communication between neurons and at the neuromuscular junction. Extensive studies on the prototypic pLGIC, the Torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) have revealed an exquisite lipid sensitivity, with the nAChR adopting a novel <b>uncoupled</b> conformation in <b>membranes</b> lacking activating anionic and neutral lipids. The lipid-exposed transmembrane alpha-helix, M 4, in each homologous subunit likely acts as a lipid sensor. One model proposes that activating lipids promote M 4 “binding” to the adjacent alpha-helices, M 1 and M 3, to enhance interactions between the M 4 C-terminus and the Cys-loop of the agonist-binding domain, with such interactions promoting coupling between the agonist site and channel gate. The first part of my thesis indirectly tests this hypothesis by exploring the effects of membrane hydrophobic thickness on nAChR function. Specifically, I tested the hypothesis that thicker membranes, which should promote alignment of M 4 parallel to M 1 /M 3 and thus helix-helix interactions, favor a coupled conformation. Although I found that the nAChR is <b>uncoupled</b> in all <b>membranes</b> tested, regardless of hydrophobic thickness, thicker membranes promote transitions from uncoupled to ultimately the desensitized state over the minutes to hours time frame. In contrast to anionic lipids, which influence function primarily via a conformational selection mechanism, membrane hydrophobic thickness influences function via a kinetic mechanism - thick membranes lower the activation energy between uncoupled and coupled conformations to promote conformational transitions. In the second part of my thesis, I used the two prokaryotic homologs, GLIC and ELIC, to explore how amino acid interactions at the interface between M 4 and M 1 /M 3 influence channel activity. Alanine scanning mutagenesis of this interface shows that disruption of almost any interaction in GLIC leads to a loss of folding and/or function, while analogous mutations in ELIC typically lead to no change or produce gains in function. Sequence comparisons {{with other members of the}} pLGIC superfamily suggest that the transmembrane domains of GLIC and ELIC represent two distinct archetypes. Each archetype may strike a different balance between the need for strong M 4 binding to M 1 /M 3 to promote folding and pentamer assembly, and the need for weaker interactions that allow for greater conformational flexibility during function...|$|R
