60|$|I {{sat down}} and looked at him, and he stood <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Marrying Sibyl Vane!" [...] cried Lord Henry, {{standing}} <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> him in perplexed amazement. [...] "But, my dear Dorian----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's {{steering}} with 'is little hind-legs," [...] said Pyecroft. [...] "Stand <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him, Robert. You'll {{never see}} such a sight again!" ...|$|R

60|$|She got <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him shyly, {{with color}} {{in her face}} and her eyes shining.|$|E
60|$|He sat <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> Starling. The latter {{hung his}} head and shook like a guilty schoolboy.|$|E
60|$|He took it <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> it, and arter 'olding it to 'is ear {{put it down}} agin.|$|E
60|$|Ridgeon, {{amazed at}} the fierceness of the outburst, puts it down with a deprecatory shrug. She takes it <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> it {{as if he had}} profaned a relic.|$|R

6000|$|... "This is his cheque-book, I think," [...] he replied, in the oblique retort, {{picking it}} <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> it. He tore out a cheque, as if pensively and by accident.|$|R

60|$|Dr. Spencer {{began to}} bethink {{him of the}} paper {{that he had been}} so eagerly drawing <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> his own begrimed hands, asked Ethel whether she would have him for a trustee.|$|R

60|$|LORD ILLINGWORTH. [Sees MRS. ARBUTHNOT'S {{letter on}} table, <b>and</b> takes it <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> envelope.] What a curious {{handwriting}}! It {{reminds me of}} the handwriting of a woman I used to know years ago.|$|R
6000|$|... "He stoops over {{to brush}} the dust off his clothes, when {{out of his}} pocket drops a fine, nine-inch burglar's steel jimmy. He picks it <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> me sharp, <b>and</b> then grins and holds out his hand.|$|R
6000|$|Instantly Thursday Smith {{straightened}} <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the man questioningly. Fogerty {{stretched out}} his hand and said, as if in wonder: ...|$|E
