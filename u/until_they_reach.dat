5|$|Females {{can produce}} up to 185,000 eggs, and larvae develop {{offshore}} {{in several stages}} before their final moult to juvenile crabs in the intertidal zone. Young crabs live among seaweeds and seagrasses, such as Posidonia oceanica, <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> adulthood.|$|E
5|$|Females become {{sexually mature}} at {{about three years}} of age and can then become pregnant; in comparison, males reach sexual {{maturity}} when they are about four years old, although they can produce sperm as early as two years. While the chest glands can be functional as early as 18 months of age, males do not begin scent-marking behaviours <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> sexual maturity. Because the offspring have a long dependent period, female koalas usually breed in alternate years. Favourable environmental factors, such as a plentiful supply of high-quality food trees, allow them to reproduce every year.|$|E
5|$|Laevistrombus {{canarium}} {{lives on}} muddy and sandy bottoms, grazing on algae and detritus. It is gonochoristic and sexually dimorphic, depending on internal fertilization for spawning. Larvae {{of this species}} spend several days as plankton, undergoing a series of transformations <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> complete metamorphosis. The maximum life span is 2 to 2.5 years. Predators of this snail include carnivorous gastropods such as cone snails and volutes. It is also a prey species for vertebrates including macaques, and also humans, who consume the soft parts {{in a wide variety}} of dishes.|$|E

5|$|Although no {{speech or}} text is used {{anywhere}} in the game aside from credits and interaction hints in the main menu, the six flower dreams follow a narrative arc. The player's starting location in each stage appears to be near the ending location of the previous one, and {{through the course of}} the game the player approaches a distant city. The first levels focus on restoring life and color to the landscape. After activating a series of windmills, the player flies through a nighttime field, illuminating darkened strings of lights <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> the city. The city is full of menacing metal structures, small arcs of electricity, and washed-out buildings; the player enlivens the city in the final two levels and transforms it into a bright and cheerful place.|$|E
5|$|Bill C-19 (previously Bill S-4) titled An Act {{to amend}} the Constitution Act, 1867 (Senate tenure) was a bill to limit new Senators' tenure to eight-year terms. Currently, {{senators}} can stay in office <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> the age of 75. The bill was first introduced {{by the government in}} the Senate on May 30, 2006. After consideration in committee and making amendments to the bill, the Senate recommended that the bill not be proceeded with until such time as the Supreme Court of Canada had ruled with respect to its constitutionality, which had not occurred prior to dissolution. The bill was reintroduced in the second session as a Commons bill on November 13, 2007, but did not become law before the session ended.|$|E
5|$|Cool air, {{carried to}} the ground by {{thunderstorm}} downdraft, cuts off the inflow of the thunderstorm, destroying its updraft and causing its dissipation. Tornadoes, which form within stronger thunderstorms, grow <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> their mature stage. This is when the rear flank downdraft of the thunderstorm, fed by rain-cooled air, begins to wrap around the tornado, cutting off the inflow of warm air which previously fed the tornado. When thunderstorms are able to organize into squall lines, a feature known as a rear inflow jet develops {{to the south of}} the mid-level circulation associated with its northern bookend vortex. This leads to an erosion of rain within the broad rain shield behind the squall line, and may lead to acceleration of the squall line itself.|$|E

5|$|Danube crested newts {{have the}} longest aquatic {{phase in the}} genus Triturus. Adults move to their {{breeding}} sites in February or March and usually stay there for six months; occasionally, they may even stay longer or return to the water in autumn. Males court females with a display of ritualised body movements. When they have gained the female's interest, they guide it over a spermatophore they deposit on the ground, which the female then takes up with her cloaca. The eggs are fertilised internally. As in other crested newts, a female lays around 200 eggs per season, which are folded individually into leaves of aquatic plants. Larvae develop over two to four months <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> metamorphosis and leave the water.|$|E
5|$|Logan quickly {{bonds with}} Jack and values her as his only friend. After {{getting into trouble}} while {{attempting}} to protect her, Logan is sent to boot camp while Jack remains at home. Both he and Jack manage to escape, find each other, and begin traveling together. During their journey, they encounter another dog called White Paws: Jack's brother who has become infected with POS. White Paws attacks Jack and severely wounds her before dying. Logan worries that Jack may have contracted the disease through contact with White Paws. The pair continue their journey <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> the town of Dayville. Logan faintly remembers that his biological father lives in the town and decides to find his father and confront him.|$|E
5|$|Almost a {{thousand}} impact craters on Venus are evenly distributed across its surface. On other cratered bodies, such as Earth and the Moon, craters show {{a range of}} states of degradation. On the Moon, degradation is caused by subsequent impacts, whereas on Earth it is caused by wind and rain erosion. On Venus, about 85% of the craters are in pristine condition. The number of craters, together with their well-preserved condition, indicates the planet underwent a global resurfacing event about 300–600 million years ago, followed by a decay in volcanism. Whereas Earth's crust is in continuous motion, Venus {{is thought to be}} unable to sustain such a process. Without plate tectonics to dissipate heat from its mantle, Venus instead undergoes a cyclical process in which mantle temperatures rise <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> a critical level that weakens the crust. Then, over a period of about 100 million years, subduction occurs on an enormous scale, completely recycling the crust.|$|E

5|$|Six to 12 larval stages occur. During {{the first}} two stages, the larvae live off {{surrounding}} fungal tissue, <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> the inner wood. Up to the fourth stage, they eat through the final summer wood along the tracheids, and finally towards the heartwood. After the seventh stage, they usually reach their maximum size. While penetrating further, they normally turn either up or down, but they turn back if they meet a foreign borehole, encounter bubbles of resin, or dry out. The larvae only live off the fungal mycelium, which they digest through a secretion. They pupate several centimeters under the bark. Before this, female larvae sequester a secretion containing fungal oidia, which adult females incorporate in their mycetangia above their ovipositors. The adults eat through the bark, but, depending on the weather, they remain in the hatch hole {{for up to three}} weeks before they leave the wood in warm and sunny weather.|$|E
5|$|The Hamsa mendicants are {{constantly}} on the move, staying in villages for just one night, in towns {{no more than five}} nights, and in sacred places for no more than seven nights. The ascetic practice of Hamsa monks includes daily consumption of the urine and dung of a cow. The Hamsa monks practice the Chandrayana cycle in their food eating habit, wherein they vary the amount of food they eat with the lunar cycle. They eat a single mouthful of food on the day after the dark new moon night, increase their food intake by an extra mouthful each day as the size of the moon increases, and reach the maximum fifteen mouthfuls of food for the day after full moon night. Thereafter, they decrease their food intake by a mouthful each day <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> the new moon night and begin the cycle again with one mouthful the following day.|$|E
5|$|While {{progressing}} {{through the}} game, the player can {{take control of}} three different characters: Juno, Vela, and Lupus. Each character has a special ability {{that allows them to}} uncover areas which the other characters cannot reach. Juno can walk through magma safely, Vela can swim underwater indefinitely, and Lupus can hover {{for a short period of}} time. Therefore, choosing the right character for the right stage is critical in order to complete the game. Initially, the game forces the player to use the three characters individually <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> a meeting point. Once they reach the meeting point, all of the worlds can be tackled with any character in any order. The overall objective of the game is to explore all the galaxy to collect several starship parts and save a large number of survivors. The player can then use a starship and travel to the final stage.|$|E

5|$|Built {{during the}} 13th and 14th centuries, the Palazzo Senatorio ("Senatorial Palace") stands atop the Tabularium, {{which had once}} housed the {{archives}} of ancient Rome. Peperino blocks from the Tabularium were re-used in {{the left side of}} the palace and a corner of the bell tower. It now houses the Roman city hall. Its double ramp of stairs was designed by Michelangelo. This double stairway to the palazzo replaced the old flight of steps and two-storied loggia, which had stood on the right side of the palace. The staircase cannot be seen solely in terms of the building to which it belongs but must be set in the context of the piazza as a whole. The steps, beginning at the center of each wing, move gently upward <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> the inner corner, level off and recede to the main surface of the façade. They then continue an unbroken stateliness toward each other, converging on the central doorway of the second story. This interruption of the diagonal line and the brief inward change of direction both absorbs the central axis and links the two sides. The fountain in front of the staircase features the river gods of the Tiber and the Nile as well as Dea Roma (Minerva). The upper part of the facade was designed by Michelangelo with colossal corinthian pilasters harmonizing with the two other buildings. Its bell-tower was designed by Martino Longhi the Elder and built between 1578 and 1582. Its current facade was built by Giacomo della Porta and Girolamo Rainaldi.|$|E
