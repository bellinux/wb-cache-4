40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{found out the}} reason that return-air {{overheated}} in the main preceding refrigeration compressor of three combined test chamber, and for trouble shooting effectively, carried out the analysis and searching fault based on course of work. At first, analyzed and judged the possible reasons that caused overheat base on experiment and common practice, but couldn’t determine it, then, inspected the compressor and adjusted valves, but couldn’t solve problem yet, finally through efforts and depth profile analysis, the real causes of malfunction were founded: there were some micronic leakage points {{in one of the}} manual valves and <b>unloading</b> <b>valve</b> of compressor in the high-pressure part of the system. The freezing medium in the system gradually missed from it on the high pressure line during long time operation, so when the leakage points were handled, the problem is properly settled. In this paper, methods and process of malfunction elimination as well as malfunction features and manifestation of the equipment in every maintenance procedure and the key to the final solutions are elaborated, which hopefully provides reference value and meaning for the maintenance of equipment of the same kind...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In the paper, for {{high-power}} marine {{overflow valve}} of low pressure big traffic problems, {{the design of}} the inside leaking mouth leaks in parallel structure,that is suitable for the different oil and water flow, using additional flow beam, guiding type low pressure large flow overflow valve was developed and the experimental study, obtained the dynamic and static parameters of the valve. Invented the inside leaking and leaked mouth parallel connection structure, inside leaking and leaked mouth parallel connection is established the mathematical model of the overflow valve. Results show that compared with the traditional straight moving type overflow valve, the type overflow valve through a larger flow, has better dynamic and static performance and cavitation resistance. The Major Technical Requirements and the Development of Ideas The pressure regulating valve is the main valve and pilot valve device and safety valve etc. innovation unique structure, {{can be used as a}} relief valve, <b>unloading</b> <b>valve,</b> external control hydraulic system pressure valve, sequence valve access and lubrication system. According to the need to form different pilot control oil forms, such as internal control, internal leakage of leakage, external control of internal leakage, external control leakage, the external control port, can be use...|$|E
5000|$|En {{remontant}} le Mississippi is a Lucky Luke comic {{written by}} Goscinny and Morris. It is the sixteenth {{title in the}} Lucky Luke Series [...] The comic was printed by Dupuis in 1961.Both Goscinny and Morris were avid readers of frontier tales and particularly Mark Twain books.This album is culturally significant as it is connected with Mark Twain experience as a Mississippi steamboat pilot before the American Civil War.The plot and many details like safety-last style of sailing, card sharks aboard, tampering with safety <b>valves,</b> <b>unloading</b> passengers {{to speed up the}} ship...etc. are borrowed from the famous (or infamous) 1870 race between paddle steamers Robert E Lee under he command of Capt Cannon and Natchez IV, under Capt Leathers ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Industrial Automation {{is a broad}} field {{among other}} {{engineering}} disciplines. The major activities of Automation stem from manufacturing industries and include cycle time improvement, productivity improvement, cost reduction, efficiency improvement, materials handling, analyze and improve the work methods, to eliminate waste and proper allocation and utilization of resources. Automation in a manufacturing shop {{is one of the}} most challenging tasks, as it has an impact of many interrelated variables and parameters. A detailed study by large data acquisition and analysis is essential for understanding the trends in productivity improvement. Productivity improvement is achieved through analyzing the current method by eliminating unnecessary movements, reducing cycle time and providing appropriate solutions to various problems during the machining of components to improve productivity. The project titled “Productivity Improvement on a CNC Lathe by Automatic Loading and <b>Unloading</b> of Throttle <b>Valve</b> Component ” includes analysis and detailed study of manufacturing process including loading and unloading methods of components on a machine. This project involves the use of automation techniques namely pneumatics automation to increase the productivity and efficiency. Present work aims at improving the productivity of throttle valve components on a CNC turning centre. Here emphasis is placed upon improving the existing time consuming methods. An effort is made to bring down the total cycle time...|$|R
