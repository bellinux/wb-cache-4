5|$|The early {{investigation}} into the size and nature of quasars drove the development of interferometry techniques in the 1950s; the Lovell telescope had an advantage due to its large collecting area, meaning that high sensitivity interferometer measurements can be made relatively quickly <b>using</b> <b>it.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, the telescope featured heavily in the discovery of quasars.|$|E

5|$|After Margaret's death, {{the castle}} {{continued}} to be owned by the Dacre family until the death of Randal Dacre in 1634, when it passed briefly to the Crown. By 1675 the castle had become derelict and was restored by the then Lord Dacre, Thomas Lennard. A new entrance to the castle was constructed and square, 17th-century windows installed. After Thomas's death in 1715 the castle was sold to Edward Hassell. The condition of the castle deteriorated again in the 18th century, becoming overgrown and dilapidated, and by the 19th century the Hassell family were <b>using</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> farmhouse.|$|E
5|$|By the 1950s, {{railroad}} traffic declined {{and parts}} of Depot Town began to fall into disrepair. The Thompson Block was put up for sale in 1950, standing vacant {{for more than a}} year. A series of businesses opened and closed in the building, with none finding lasting success. In the late 1960s, landlord David Kircher bought the building, <b>using</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> warehouse. From 1996 until 2005, the building was tied up in legal disputes. Kircher was found guilty of demolition by neglect, and first Barnes and Barnes and then Beal Properties were named receivers. In May 2006, Stewart Beal purchased the building outright.|$|E

5|$|The main tower's spire {{was removed}} during the Battle of Moscow {{to prevent the}} Luftwaffe from <b>using</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> landmark. Shortly {{after the war ended}} in 1945, {{sections}} of the gardens were annexed for the building of an apartment block. A fire in 1956 caused the collapse of the lantern over the principal tower's dome. Existing tenants were slowly rehoused, and members of the Mosspetspromproyekt (Russian: Мосспецпромпроект) research institute took possession of the former church. The research institute dealt primarily with project drawings for industrial facilities, but also designed the Olympic cauldron used at Lenin Stadium for the 1980 Summer Games.|$|E
5|$|A {{farmer and}} his son were {{ploughing}} a field on the Isle of Mull using a team of four horses beside Loch Freisa, but work stalled {{after one of the}} horses lost a shoe and was unable to continue. Noticing a horse grazing nearby they decided to try <b>using</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> replacement. Once harnessed to the wooden plough the horse appeared to be familiar with the task, and initially worked steadily. As it began to work towards an area closest to the loch, it became restless and the farmer gently used a whip to encourage the animal to continue. It reacted by immediately transforming into a gigantic boobrie, giving out a loud bellow and diving into the loch, pulling the plough and the other three horses with it. The frightened farmer {{and his son}} watched as the creature swam to the centre of the loch then dived underwater, taking the other horses and plough with it. Seven hours later there was still no sign of the three horses.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} in New York, Häyhänen {{spent the next}} two years establishing his identity. During that time he received money from his superiors left in dead-letter boxes in the Bronx and Manhattan. It is known he occasionally drew attention to himself by indulging in heavy drinking sessions and heated arguments with his Finnish wife Hannah. For six months Häyhänen checked the thumbtack and no one had made contact. He also checked a dead-drop location he had memorized. There he found a hollowed-out nickel. However, prior to opening the coin Häyhänen had misplaced it, either buying a newspaper with it or <b>using</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> subway token. For the next seven months the hollow nickel travelled around the New York City economy, unopened. The trail of the hollow nickel ended when a thirteen-year-old newsboy was collecting for his weekly deliveries. The newsboy accidentally dropped the nickel and it broke in half, revealing a microphotograph containing a series of numbers. The newsboy handed the nickel to a New York detective, who in turn forwarded it to the FBI. From 1953 to 1957, though every effort was made to decipher the microphotograph, the FBI was unable to solve the mystery.|$|E

5|$|In {{adopting}} Christianity as {{the state}} religion, Mieszko sought to achieve several personal goals. He saw Poland's baptism {{as a way of}} strengthening his hold on power, as well as <b>using</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> unifying force for the Polish people. It replaced several smaller cults with a single, central one, clearly associated with the royal court. It would also improve the position and respectability of the Polish state on the international, European scene. The Church also helped to strengthen the monarch's authority, and brought to Poland much experience with regard to state administration. Thus, the Church organisation supported the state, and in return, bishops received important government titles (in the later era, they were members of the Senate of Poland).|$|E
5|$|On March 31, 2014, the FCC voted 3–2 {{to approve}} the {{proposed}} ban on joint sales agreements and voted 5–0 {{to approve the}} proposed ban on coordinated retransmission consent negotiations {{between two of the}} four highest-rated stations within a given market; the JSA ban went into effect on June 19, 2014. Under the restrictions, the FCC would rule on waivers to maintain select existing JSAs within 90 days of the application's filing. The FCC also began a request for comment on policies to address other agreements, such as shared services agreements. The prohibition on television JSAs had been proposed as early as 2004, a year after the FCC voted to treat JSAs between radio stations as duopolies. Despite this fact, broadcasting companies criticized the ban, accusing the Commission of <b>using</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> move to encourage participation in a spectrum incentive auction then set to occur in 2015, and stating that the ban would place them at a disadvantage during retransmission consent negotiations with pay television providers.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{separated}} by market gardens and fields, the two areas merged over the years, with the docks becoming {{an important part}} of the Elizabethan exploration. Queen Elizabeth I visited the royal dockyard on 4 April 1581 to knight the adventurer Francis Drake. As well as for exploration, Deptford was important for trade - the Honourable East India Company had a yard in Deptford from 1607 until late in the 17th century, later (1825) taken over by the General Steam Navigation Company. It was also connected with the slave trade, John Hawkins <b>using</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> base for his operations, and Olaudah Equiano, the slave who became {{an important part of}} the abolition of the slave trade, was sold from one ship's captain to another in Deptford around 1760.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{eccentric}} member of staff is Alan Statham (Mark Heap), an overbearing, stuttering and pedantic consultant radiologist, whose everyday actions regularly border on insanity. He is desperately and hopelessly {{in love with}} Joanna Clore (Pippa Haywood), the 48-year-old head of human resources with an increasingly sardonic attitude. Their relationship is an open secret, with student doctor Boyce (Oliver Chris), often <b>using</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> weapon against them, bullying Alan constantly. Joanna's human resources staff also use it against her, in particular Kim Alabaster (Sally Bretton), who has a bad attitude towards {{most of the people}} she meets, and Naughty Rachel (Katie Lyons), who earned her nickname due to her love of sex. The other HR staff include Harriet Schulenburg (Olivia Colman), an overworked mother of four trapped in an unhappy marriage, and Karen Ball (Lucinda Raikes), who divides her time between doing much of the office's work, trying to attract Martin's affections, and being bullied by Kim and Rachel.|$|E
5|$|The Earl {{can be a}} {{grotesque}} caricature of a Victorian gentleman: a rotund figure in cape and top hat (hiding his horns), with a perpetual enormous grin and pince-nez spectacles. Although his attitude is often cheerful, he is quick to reveal his more intimidating, malicious side. The Earl has a golem named , a pink umbrella with a small, talking jack-o-lantern at its tip. It usually talks excitedly or screams, adding {{its name to the}} end of almost every sentence. Lero, used by the Earl as a Mary Poppins-type flying umbrella, is very loyal to him and guards his sword. Road often takes Lero against its will, <b>using</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> witch's broom or an ordinary umbrella. It {{has been used as a}} beacon to summon Akuma, to transport several exorcists to the Ark and to guard the Noah. Lero has a sword similar to Allen Walker's sword of exorcism, which surprises him when they clash on Noah's Ark. Despite his antipathy to the Noah Nea, the Earl grows depressed when he talks about him.|$|E
5|$|The Sinclairs of Mey {{sold their}} {{portion of the}} island to Colonel F.B. Imbert-Terry in 1929, who sold it in turn to John Hoyland, an {{umbrella}} manufacturer from Yorkshire, in 1947. Hoyland also acquired the remaining island estate of the Sinclairs of Freswick, uniting Stroma for a reported cost of £4,000. His tenure coincided with the final collapse of the island's population. As the tenants left, Hoyland put Stroma on the market but found no buyers. A Caithness councilman suggested various schemes for Stroma, including establishing a nudist colony and <b>using</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> site for a crematorium, but the council rejected suggestions that it should take on responsibility for the island. As the population left, the local economy disintegrated; there were no longer enough able-bodied men to man the fishing boats, and the remaining facilities on the island were closed down for lack of custom. The last store on the island, the Scottish Cooperative Wholesale Society shop, closed in 1956. Only three families, numbering 16 people in total, were left by 1957; that year, the island's school closed, by which time it only had two pupils. The Post Office closed in 1958 when the family which operated it left for the mainland.|$|E

5|$|In general, Geographia Neoteriki, {{was welcomed}} with enthusiasm by western {{intellectual}} circles. Jean-Baptiste d'Ansse de Villoison, professor of modern Greek in the Ecole des Langues Orientales Vivantes, <b>used</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> textbook for his students. French geographer Barbie du Bocage published a review after the book's publication along with a translated passage. Moreover, travellers who published accounts during the early 19th century, frequently cited the text. François Pouqueville, William Martin Leake, Henry Holland, and Lord Byron mentioned this work, and <b>used</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> source of information. The book also enjoyed some popularity in the non Greek regions of the Balkan peninsula, while 19th century Bulgarian authors of geographic textbooks <b>used</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> model.|$|R

5|$|The second {{large-scale}} {{campaign is}} dated to 943, when Igor was {{the supreme leader}} of the Rus', according to the Primary Chronicle. During the 943 expedition, the Rus' rowed up the Kura River, deep into the Caucasus, defeated the forces of Marzuban bin Muhammad, and captured Bardha'a, the capital of Arran. The Rus' allowed the local people to retain their religion in exchange for recognition of their overlordship; {{it is possible that}} the Rus' intended to settle permanently there. According to ibn Miskawaih, the local people broke the peace by stone-throwing and other abuse directed against the Rus', who then demanded that the inhabitants evacuate the city. This ultimatum was rejected, and the Rus' began killing people and holding many for ransom. The slaughter was briefly interrupted for negotiations, which soon broke down. The Rus' stayed in Bardha'a for several months, <b>using</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> base for plundering the adjacent areas, and amassed substantial spoils.|$|E
5|$|The town's name {{derives from}} a {{corruption}} of the Celtic word bol and the Old English word pool meaning a place near a pool or creek. Variants include Pool, Pole, Poles, Poll, Polle, Polman, and Poolman. The area around modern Poole has been inhabited for the past 2,500years. During the 3rd century BC, Celts known as the Durotriges moved from hilltop settlements at Maiden Castle and Badbury Rings to heathland around the River Frome and Poole Harbour. The Romans landed at Poole during their conquest of Britain in the 1st century and took over an Iron Age settlement at Hamworthy, an area {{just west of the}} modern town centre. In Anglo-Saxon times, Poole was included in the Kingdom of Wessex. The settlement was used as a base for fishing and the harbour a place for ships to anchor {{on their way to the}} River Frome and the important Anglo-Saxon town of Wareham. Poole experienced two large-scale Viking invasions during this era: in 876, Guthrum sailed his fleet through the harbour to attack Wareham, and in 1015, Canute began his conquest of England in Poole Harbour, <b>using</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> base to raid and pillage Wessex.|$|E
5|$|When {{a warrior}} is so old, or sustains an injury {{that means they}} can no longer serve their Clan, they retire to become elders. Elders live out the {{remainder}} of their life in general peace, <b>using</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> time of rest and relaxation. They sleep in their own separate den, which is looked after by the apprentices. Elders are not expected to hunt or fight for their Clan, but are able to do so if the mood takes them. Their only expected duty is to carry the body of a deceased Clanmate to their grave. Every cat of the Clan respects and appreciates the elders, thanking them for the time they have spent upholding their roles as a warrior. Sadly, it is rare for a Clan to have more than three or four elders, as many warriors die before they can retire.|$|E
