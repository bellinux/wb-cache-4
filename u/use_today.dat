5|$|Desiccated thyroid extract is an animal-based {{thyroid gland}} extract, most {{commonly}} from pigs. It {{is a combination}} therapy, containing forms of T4 and T3. It also contains calcitonin (a hormone produced in the thyroid gland involved in the regulation of calcium levels), T1 and T2; these are not present in synthetic hormone medication. This extract was once a mainstream hypothyroidism treatment, but its <b>use</b> <b>today</b> is unsupported by evidence; British Thyroid Association and American professional guidelines discourage its use.|$|E
5|$|Hafnium was {{separated}} from zirconium through repeated recrystallization of the double ammonium or potassium fluorides by Valdemar Thal Jantzen and von Hevesey.

The vessel's use was curtailed by U.S. and Belgian authorities citing safety concerns. By 1871, the Pennsylvania oil fields were making limited use of oil tank barges and cylindrical railroad tank-cars {{similar to those in}} <b>use</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E

5|$|Like aluminium, copper is {{recyclable}} {{without any}} loss of quality, both from raw state and from manufactured products.

The application of metagenomics has allowed the development of commodity and fine chemicals, agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals where the benefit of enzyme-catalyzed chiral synthesis is increasingly recognized.|$|E
