30|$|There is {{in general}} great {{uncertainty}} about {{the actual number of}} workers employed at the minimum wage, as estimates by various sources may differ significantly. Overall, the WDN estimates are comparable with the official estimates by national statistical offices or ministries for 2013 (see Table  2), though the WDN estimates other than those for Latvia, Estonia, and Poland are a little higher than the national statistics. The most pronounced differences are observed for Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria. There are several possible explanations for the differences in terms of the share of minimum wage earners in these countries. First, there are differences in terms of the composition of the sample compared to administrative databases in terms of sectors and size. In addition, official statistics often do not account for the shadow economy, while the WDN survey is likely to have captured some employees affected by tax evasion and <b>unaccounted</b> employees (<b>for</b> example, workers paid below the minimum wage are likely to have been included). To minimise the administrative burden of the respondents, they were asked to provide an estimate and not an exact number which also explains part of the difference. For Hungary, the WDN outcome quite close to other estimations, for example those that are based on tax declarations of individuals (30 %, see Krekó and Kiss 2007).|$|R
30|$|Individual {{characteristics}} {{account for}} a substantial fraction of the observed public-private wage gap, but there remains an <b>unaccounted</b> gap. <b>For</b> the pool of euro area countries, the estimated wage gap conditional on characteristics over the 2004 – 2012 period for the broad NACE proxy to the government sector (OPQ sectors) is 60 % lower than the estimated unconditional wage gap (Table 1, column (2) versus (1)), since the observable characteristics between the two sectors are different, e.g., in the public sector, workers are on average better educated than in the private sector. For the period 2004 – 2012 as a whole, positive wage gaps are estimated for 21 out of the 23 analyzed EU countries. Conditional wage gaps are larger for countries that suffered fiscal stress over the crisis (Cyprus, Spain, Ireland, Portugal, Greece, and Italy) and Luxembourg and tend to be higher when a more restricted definition of the government sector (NACE O sector) is considered (Table 1, column (5)), i.e., {{when looking at the}} sectors in which there exists a quasi-monopoly power of the government as service provider. There has been a reduction in some countries in the estimated (conditional) wage gap {{as a consequence of the}} economic crisis and the recent fiscal consolidation episode (Table 1, column (4) versus (3)). For the euro area as a whole (pool), the estimated conditional wage gap for the period 2010 – 2012 for the broad NACE proxy of government-related activities is 40 % lower than the one estimated for the 2004 – 2009 period. In general, the wage premium falls more markedly in countries with larger pre-crisis levels.|$|R
40|$|Leakage is {{the major}} factor <b>for</b> <b>unaccounted</b> losses in every pipe network around the world (oil, gas or water). In most cases the {{deleterious}} effects associated with the occurrence of leaks may present serious economical and health problems. Therefore, leaks must be quickly detected, located and repaired.

In this work we present a new in-pipe leak detection system, PipeGuard. PipeGuard performs autonomous leak detection in pipes and, thus, eliminates the need for user experience. This paper focuses on the detection module and its main characteristics. Detection in based on the presence of a pressure gradient in the neighborhood of the leak. Moreover, the proposed detector can sense leaks at any angle around the circumference of the pipe with only two sensors.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the impact of frequency of broad-leaf crops canola and pea in various crop rotations on pH, total organic C (TOC), total organic N (TON), light fraction organic C (LFOC) and light fraction organic N (LFON) in the 0 - 7. 5 and 7. 5 - 15 cm soil depths in autumn 2009 after 12 years (1998 - 2009) on a Dark Brown Chernozem (Typic Boroll) loam at Scott, Saskatchewan, Canada. The field ex-periment contained monoculture canola (herbicide tolerant and blackleg resistant hybrid) and monoculture pea compared with rotations that contained these crops every 2 -, 3 -, and 4 -yr with wheat. There was no effect of crop rotation duration and crop phase on soil pH. Mass of TOC and TON in the 0 - 15 cm soil was greater in canola phase than pea phase in the 1 -yr (monoculture) and 2 -yr crop rotations, while the opposite was true in the 3 -yr and 4 -yr crop rotations. Mass of TOC and TON (averaged across crop phases,) in soil generally increased with increasing crop rotation duration, with the maximum in the 4 -yr rotation while no difference in the 1 -yr and 2 -yr rotations. Mass of LFOC and LFON in soil was greater in canola phase than pea phase in the 1 -yr, 2 -yr and 3 -yr rotations, but the opposite was true in the 4 -yr rotation. There was no consistent effect of crop rotation duration on mass of LFOC and LFON. The N balance sheet over the 1998 to 2009 period indicated large amounts of <b>unaccounted</b> N <b>for</b> monoculture pea, suggesting a great potential for N loss from the soil-plant system in this treatment through nitrate leaching and/or denitrification.

40|$|This report uses readily {{available}} historical information to better define the volume, chemical composition, and Cs- 137 /Sr- 90 amounts for leaks {{that have occurred}} in the past for tanks SX- 108, SX- 109, SX- 111, and SX- 112. In particular a Historical Leak Model (HLM) is developed that is a month by month reconciliation of tank levels, fill records, and calculated boil-off rates for these tanks. The HLM analysis is an independent leak estimate that reconstructs the tank thermal histories thereby deriving each tank`s evaporative volume loss and by difference, its unaccounted losses as well. The HLM analysis was meant to demonstrate the viability of its approach, not necessarily to establish the HLM leak estimates as being definitive. Past leak estimates for these tanks have invariably resorted to soil wetting arguments but the extent of soil contaminated by each leak has always been highly uncertain. There is also a great deal of uncertainty with the HLM that was not quantified in this report, but will be addressed later. These four tanks (among others) were used from 1956 to 1975 for storage of high-level waste from the Redox process at Hanford. During their operation, tank waste temperatures were often as high as 150 C (300 F), but were more typically around 130 C. The primary tank cooling was by evaporation of tank waste and therefore periodic replacement of lost volume with water was necessary to maintain each tank`s inventory. This active reflux of waste resulted in very substantial turnovers in tank inventory as well as significant structural degradation of these tanks. As a result of the loss of structural integrity, each of these tanks leaked during their active periods of operation. Unfortunately, the large turnover in tank volume associated with their reflux cooling has made a determination of leak volumes very difficult. During much of these tanks operational histories, inventory losses because of evaporative cooling could have effectively masked any volume loss due to leak. However, careful comparison with reported tank levels during certain periods clearly show <b>unaccounted</b> volume losses <b>for</b> many tanks. As a result of the HLM analysis, SX- 108, SX- 109, SX- 111, and SX- 112 all show clear evidence of unaccounted volume losses during the period 1958 to 1975. Likewise, the HLM does not show similar <b>unaccounted</b> volume losses <b>for</b> tank SX- 105, a tank with no reported leak history, verifying that the HLM is consistent with SX- 105 not leaking. These unaccounted volume losses establish the leak start date and rate, and when propagated over time show that SX- 108 lost 203 kgal followed by SX- 109 at 111. SX- 111 at 55, and SX- 112 at 44 kgal. 0664 These leak volumes represent maximum or upper bounds estimates of each leak and are in total volume about six times the previous leak estimates...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between accrual inefficiency in analysts' forecasts and analyst following, analysts' forecasting ability, {{and the relative}} magnitude of discretionary accruals is analyzed. Results aid in answering two research questions: (1) whether the accrual mispricing anomaly has economic substance or is merely an artifact of missing risk factors; and (2) whether the observed financial analysts' response to accounting accruals {{is consistent with the}} accrual mispricing anomaly or its origins lie elsewhere. Sloan [1996] provides evidence of abnormal market returns correlated with the prior year's accrual and cash flow components of earnings. Few possible explanations are presented in the literature for the observed phenomenon: the Naive Investor Hypothesis suggests that market participants "fixate" on earnings figures and erroneously estimate earnings persistence without regard for the impact of accruals. Alternatively there are concerns that the observed abnormal returns are merely compensation <b>for</b> <b>unaccounted</b> risk factors and thus do not constitute a departure from market efficiency. Results of this study provide evidence of accrual misinterpretation among financial analysts consistent with the pattern of mispricing that is observed in the market. This conclusion supports the view of accrual mispricing as a true market anomaly. Moreover, the naive investor hypothesis is supported by the evidence that analysts' response to accounting accruals improves with their forecasting ability and that greater analyst following leads to consensus forecasts being more efficient...|$|R

Because the event had not been registered as a UNICEF benefit beforehand, and was therefore not granted tax-exempt status – the blame for which Harrison lay squarely at Klein's feet – most of the money generated was held in an Internal Revenue Service escrow account for ten years. In interview with Derek Taylor for his autobiography in the late 1970s, Harrison put this figure at somewhere between $8 million and $10 million.

Owing to minimum legal sizes and quotas or non-consumptive fishing practices, some afflicted fish are released, raising {{concerns over the}} potential <b>for</b> <b>unaccounted</b> fishing mortality. Two experiments were completed to quantify the (1) clinical signs of barotrauma among fish angled from 6 to 120 m (experiment 1) and (2) mortality (over 3 d) of fish with barotrauma that were released following either no treatment, venting (e. g. needle) or recompression (e. g. release weight) (experiment 2). In experiment 1, barotrauma was evident in some fish angled from 11 m and all from 3 ̆e 20 m. Fish were considered to have barotrauma {{if they had a}} prolapsed cloaca combined with a distended coelomic cavity and/or gastric herniation into the buccal cavity. Despite similar clinical signs among fish in experiment 2, none died, however, the associated trauma raises welfare concerns. Both recompression and venting offered benefits over no treatment by returning fish to depth quickly and releasing gases, respectively. Nevertheless, the release method should be dictated by the clinical signs of barotrauma and extrinsic conditions, including the competency of the fisher (e. g. for venting), presence of predators (e. g. for recompression), and exposure to sun or warm water (e. g. no treatment). More selective gears, spatial and temporal closures, or possibly replacing minimum legal sizes with quotas in deep water only could also reduce the frequency of barotrauma among released P. auratus and therefore, negative impacts on stocks...|$|R

In addition to waste of resources, contaminants may infiltrate into the water supply. The possibility of environmental health disasters due to delay in detection of water pipeline leaks have spurred research into the development of methods for pipeline leak and contamination detection. This thesis is on the analysis and design of a floating mobile sensor for leak detection in water distribution pipes. This work covers the study of two modules, namely a "floating body" along with its "sensing module". The Mobility Module or the floating body was carefully studied and designed using advanced CFD techniques to make the body as non-invasive to the flow as possible and to avoid signal corruption. In addition, experiments were carried out to investigate the effectiveness of using in-pipe measurements for leak detection in plastic pipes. Specifically, acoustic signals due to simulated leaks were measured and studied for designing a detection system to be deployed inside water networks of 100 mm pipe size. by Dimitris M.

The heavy rains, caused by outer bands of the cyclone before it made landfall, limited play in Chittagong in the third One Day International cricket match between India and Bangladesh, before the match was abandoned. Strong winds caused power outages throughout Cox's Bazar District, and downed about 200 trees on St. Martin's Island. The cyclone left a total of 10boats <b>unaccounted</b> <b>for,</b> with about 50fishermen missing. In total, three fisherman were confirmed killed, all on St. Martin's Island, with two people left hospitalized. The passage of Cyclone Akash left many people homeless. Initially {{there was no response}} from the government. In all, 14 people were killed by Akash and damages amounted to US$982million.|$|E
5|$|On {{its first}} landfall, the {{tropical}} storm buffeted the eastern-central Philippines with damaging winds gusting up to 160km/h (100mph), heavy rainfall, and rough seas. At least 20 provinces experienced adverse or dangerous weather, {{with the worst}} conditions concentrated over the islands of Samar and Masbate. While structural and crop damages were limited, local infrastructure and transportation suffered the greatest. Nepartak's winds caused complete power outages on Samar, Masbate, and nearby Marinduque, affecting their entire collective population of nearly four million individuals. Many schools were closed. The storm forced the cancellation of nearly two dozen domestic flights {{to and from the}} region, and at least 120 ferries and other vessels sought shelter in ports around the Manila, Bicol, and Visayas regions. On those ships were more than 5,000 people who became stranded until safe passage could be made. By November 15, five deaths had been confirmed in the Philippines, four the result of electrocutions from downed powerlines. Immediately following the disaster, then-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo made assisting the stranded passengers in coastal ports a priority. According to the PAGASA in its post-storm report, a total of 13 people lost their lives, 5 others remained <b>unaccounted</b> <b>for,</b> and 11 sustained injuries. One newspaper reported that a motorized craft in the Tañon Strait capsized {{at the height of the}} storm, forcing the rescue of 11 people. Another source also describes the sinking of a boat with at least 13 survivors and one fatality. It is not clear whether these accounts cover the same incident.|$|E
5|$|One {{shrimp boat}} was {{initially}} reported missing and the tug Myra White transmitted a distress signal as its engines failed near an oil rig off of Galveston. High winds shattered glass windows at Port Arthur, Texas City, and Galveston, while schools {{were shut down}} in Galveston, Lamarque, Texas City, Alvin, and most of Galveston and Jefferson counties. Despite a brief power outage at Lamarque, electricity was quickly restored after the storm. Powerful gusts downed branches, electrical poles, and tore off shingles in Port Arthur and Galveston, but damage was minimal at High Island, where Cindy made landfall. The U.S. Coast Guard responded to four requests for assistance at Galveston, and nine vessels attempted to seek refuge at Port Arthur; the Coast Guard eventually permitted six to enter, {{and the other three}} apparently traveled to Galveston. Meanwhile, to the northwest, the port of Houston was closed {{for the duration of the}} storm. Trucks and boats were dispatched by civil defense officials in Jefferson County after declaring a state of emergency following numerous requests for assistance by residents of flooded homes. Two children, initially <b>unaccounted</b> <b>for,</b> were later found safe under a bridge abutment.|$|E
40|$|Background : Currently, {{analyzing}} the economic losses caused by health problems in population {{is of particular}} importance since it stipulates calculations of the volumes invested in healthcare systems {{in order to improve}} population’s health. Objective: The aim of our study was to find out economic losses caused by traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children. Methods: The given work has utilized governmental statistical reports for Russia, for federal regions as well as for individual subjects. Direct medical expenses (medical services) and indirect expenses (losses due to a temporary disability of parents having a sick child) were calculated both in general and per patient. Results : Among all the direct medical costs of treatment of children with TBI inpatient care costs account for 85 %. In the Central and Volga Federal District accounted for half of nationwide spending in general, brain injury and to provide certain kinds of healthcare. The structure of Russian costs {{as a result of the}} incidence of TBI children Moscow accounts for 20 %. In Moscow, the cost of treating cases of traumatic brain injury in children is 3. 2 times higher than the average for Russia. The resulting calculations of the value of health care costs attributable to a case of child head injury, behind the cost of treatment of the case of a child with head trauma, calculated according to the standards of Russia and the territories. This difference in the whole RF is 23 %. Conclusion : The obtained findings have shown that in 2010 in Russia the magnitude of losses caused by TBI incidence in children amounted to 3 billion roubles or 0. 008 % of the gross product 1. 2 billion roubles of which were direct expenses. However, this figure is considerably lower of the real amount; it becomes evident after the analysis of direct medical expenses per one case of pediatric TBI. Our calculations have shown that in Russia and in its regions the amount of expenses per one TBI patient is a quarter less of the standard sum per one TBI case what is calculated according to factual parameters. The detected incomplete sum per one case of pediatric TBI, on one hand, may be explained by a high level of hospitalization of children with minor head injury. On the other hand, it may be a result of insufficient healthcare financing in regions as well as it may be explained by <b>unaccounted</b> expenses <b>for</b> medical care and drug coverage, especially in children with severe traumatic brain injury.  </p...|$|R
40|$|Heterochromatin {{is key to}} the {{appropriate}} regulation of cell identity. Saccharomyces cerevisiae silent mating loci, HML and HMR, provide a simple, yet elegant model for the regional control of transcriptional repression and its contribution to cell identity. Yeast can be of mating type a or &alpha as is dependent on the alleles at the actively transcribed MAT locus. However, additional copies of the &alpha and a genes are present elsewhere in the genome to facilitate mating-type switching. Interestingly, even though HML and HMR have the exact same promoters as when the genes are at the MAT locus, the genes are not expressed. This promoter-independent repression is due to the Silence Information Regulator (Sir) proteins. Current models of yeast silencing posit that Sir proteins are recruited by transcription factors to HML and HMR. Sir 2, whose catalytic activity is necessary for silencing and is the founding member of the sirtuin enzymatic class, deacetylates the neighboring nucleosome creating a high-affinity binding site for the Sir complex. Iterative rounds of this deacetylation results in spreading of Sir proteins across the silenced locus, which is key to silencing. Through a similar mechanism, the Sir-protein complex is also important for silencing telomeres. This nucleation and spreading model for silencing makes testable prediction of silencing. For example, if iterative rounds of deacetylation by Sir 2 are necessary for silencing, then a Sir complex would occupy each nucleosome at silenced loci. Additionally, this model only attributes Sir-protein association to HML, HMR and telomeres and not elsewhere in the genome. Lastly, if Sir 2 's only known role is to deacetylate nucleosome tails then its catalytic activity should be bypassed by preemptively removing these histone acetylations. To test these predictions of the silencing model I have definitively characterized the distribution of Sir proteins throughout the genome and explored the <b>unaccounted</b> role <b>for</b> Sir 2 's catalytic activity in silencing. By characterizing the distributions of Sir 2, Sir 3 and Sir 4 at high-resolution I have revealed unappreciated nucleation sites for Sir proteins at HML and HMR and a possible higher-order structure critical to silencing. Characterization of Sir proteins across the genome revealed an unanticipated phenomenon of highly-expressed genes being vulnerable to non-specific ChIP enrichment. Lastly, I performed a forward genetic screen to restore silencing independent of Sir 2 catalytic activity. This screen identified a non-sirtuin deacetylase as refractory to silencing and suggested the possible role of a non-histone deacetylase substrate as important for silencing.

40|$|Although {{a number}} of recent studies have focused on the {{existence}} of a non-negligible sire contemporary group interaction effect (s) affecting the estimation of genetic parameters for maternally influenced traits in beef cattle, the assessment and interpretation of this effect using field data remains poorly understood. In this study 27, 639 records of both birth weight (BW) and weaning weight (WW) from the Asturiana de los Valles breed were used to assess the consequences of the inclusion of an s effect on the estimation of genetic parameters for BW, WW and average daily gain (ADG) fitting univariate and bivariate models. Estimations of s 2 for BW, WWand ADG were 0. 040, 0. 070 and 0. 077 regardless of the fitted model. Inclusion of s in the estimation models induced a reduction of both the direct and the maternal heritability, varying between 8 and 28 % with the trait and the estimation model employed. As expected, the correlations between both direct and maternal genetic effects for each trait were less negative when s was included in the estimation model. The estimated correlations between the s effect affecting BW, WW and ADG were 0. 108, 0. 038 and 0. 616 for the pairs BW–WW, BW–ADG and WW–ADG, respectively. These results suggest that misidentification of individuals cannot be the sole cause of the effect of s and that this effect is of a different nature and origin for different traits (i. e. selective matings for low BW’s and <b>unaccounted</b> management practices <b>for</b> preweaning growth traits). Models including the s effect should be accepted as working models in beef improvement schemes...|$|R
