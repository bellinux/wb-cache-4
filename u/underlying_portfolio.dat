40|$|The Fama-French three factor {{model is}} {{ubiquitous}} in modern finance. Returns are modeled as a linear {{combination of a}} market factor, a size factor and a book-to-market equity ratio (or “value”) factor. The success of this approach, since its introduction in 1992, has resulted in widespread adoption and {{a large body of}} related academic literature. The risk factors exhibit serial correlation at a monthly timeframe. This property is strongest in the value factor, perhaps due to its association with global funding liquidity risk. Using thirty years of Fama-French portfolio data, I show that autocorrelation of the value factor may be exploited to efficiently allocate capital into segments of the US stock market. The strategy outperforms the <b>underlying</b> <b>portfolios</b> on an absolute and risk adjusted basis. Annual returns are 5 % greater than the components and Sharpe Ratio is increased by 86 %.

50|$|Recently, Anderson {{has focused}} on the {{analysis}} of investment strategies, and his work relies on both theoretical considerations and empirical analysis. In an article published in the Financial Analysts Journal in 2012 and cited below, Anderson, Bianchi and Goldberg found that long-term returns to risk parity strategies, which have acquired {{tens of billions of dollars}} in assets under management in the wake of the global financial crisis, are not materially different from the returns to more transparent strategies once realistic financing and trading costs are taken into account; they do well in some periods and poorly in others. A subsequent investigation by the same research team found that returns to dynamically levered strategies such as risk parity are highly unpredictable due to high sensitivity of strategy performance to a key risk factor: the co-movement of leverage with return to the <b>underlying</b> <b>portfolio</b> that is levered.|$|E
5000|$|The modern global {{tactical}} {{asset allocation}} program {{is composed of}} two separate strategies: strategic rebalancing and overlay. The strategic rebalancing element of GTAA {{program is designed to}} remove any unintentional asset allocation risk which can be caused by various factors, including: drift risk, which occurs when the value of <b>underlying</b> <b>portfolio</b> holdings moves away from the strategic benchmark due to differences in asset class returns, due to changes in asset valuation, cash holdings, currency deviations from stock selection, unintentional country deviations within underlying stock/bond portfolios, manager of benchmark transitions, and contributions to and redemptions from the portfolio. The overlay element of GTAA program is designed to capture excess return through intentional, opportunistic, long and short positions in asset classes and countries. The GTAA strategy can be viewed as making two major types of decisions: The first type is asset class timing, including stocks vs. bonds vs. cash, small-cap vs. large-cap stocks, value vs. growth stocks, emerging vs. developed stocks and bonds, etc. This kind of decision making {{is often referred to as}} TAA. The second type of decision is known as country or sector decisions within asset classes, including country selection in developed and emerging equity, as well as fixed income and currency markets. These are the global relative-value decisions which give meaning to the [...] "G" [...] in GTAA and distinguish the strategy from traditional market timing.|$|E
5000|$|In 1993, Goldberg left academia {{to pursue}} a career in {{quantitative}} finance at Barra (now MSCI), and she has been a proponent of research that combines best practices from industry and the university. [...] Early in the 2000s, in collaboration with Kay Giesecke, she developed a top down methodology based on point processes that is used to assess complex credit derivatives.Beginning in 2006, Goldberg, in collaboration with Guy Miller and Jared Weinstein, developed a patented extension of quantitative risk management tools to extreme events and market turbulence.Goldberg also holds two patents on industry-standard multi-asset class risk models and one patent on incomplete information credit models. Early in the financial crisis of 2007-08, Goldberg warned against the risks associated with the reliance on Gaussian models.Risk parity strategies have been claimed by a number of practitioners to deliver investment performance superior to traditional strategies, and have been especially popular since the financial crisis of 2007-08. In collaboration with Robert M. Anderson (economist) and Stephen Bianchi, Goldberg demonstrated that long-horizon performance of risk parity strategies is qualitatively similar to long-horizon performance of traditional strategies after accounting for realistic financing and trading costs, and that risk parity substantially underperforms traditional strategies in certain time periods. [...] Subsequent research by the same team extends the findings to the more general class of dynamically levered strategies, and it reveals high sensitivity of strategy performance to a previously unidentified source of risk: the co-movement of leverage with return to the <b>underlying</b> <b>portfolio</b> that is levered. They also pointed out that levered strategies involving bonds, including risk parity, are very vulnerable in a rising interest rate environment, the precise environment that many analysts predict for the coming years.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The recent {{literature}} on using portfolios for high stakes assessment highlights what Green and Smyser (1995) identify as two contradictory portfolio purposes: formative and summative evaluation. This article discusses {{the characteristics of}} portfolios used for formative and summative assessment, suggesting that unless the conflicting paradigms and competing purposes <b>underlying</b> <b>portfolios</b> are recognized, their value for learning may be subverted. Electronic portfolio technologies promise support for both high-stakes assessment and deep student learning—dual purposes frequently in conflict. The authors argue for a balanced system that respects {{the value of the}} portfolio for self-assessment and life-long learning. What is a portfolio? Artists have maintained portfolios for years, often using their collection for seeking further work, or for simply demonstrating their art; it is useful to note, however, that an artist's portfolio usually includes only a person’s best work. Financial portfolios contain a comprehensive record of fiscal transactions and investment holdings that represent a person's monetary worth. This is often a summative record tha...|$|R
5000|$|The capital {{assessment}} {{is intended to}} capture all aspects of a financial institution’s business that would be impacted under the baseline and more adverse scenarios. [...] Supervisors will carefully evaluate the forecasts submitted by each financial institution to ensure they are appropriate, consistent with the firm’s <b>underlying</b> <b>portfolio</b> performance and reflective of each entity’s particular business activities and risk profile. The assessment of the firm’s capital {{and the size of}} any potential needed additions to capital will be determined by the supervisors. [...] The assessment of capital adequacy considers many factors including: the inherent risks of the institution’s exposures and business activities, the quality of its balance sheet assets and its off-balance-sheet commitments, the firm’s earning projections, expectations regarding economic conditions and the composition and quality of its capital. Specific factors supervisors consider include: uncertainty about the potential impact on earnings and capital from current and prospective economic conditions; asset quality and concentrations of credit exposures; the potential for unanticipated losses and declines in asset values; off‐balance sheet and contingent liabilities (e.g., implicit and explicit liquidity and credit commitments); the composition, level and quality of capital; the ability of the institution to raise additional common stock and other forms of capital in the market; and other risks that are not fully captured in regulatory capital calculations. Under current rules for bank holding companies, supervisors expect bank holding companies to hold capital above minimum regulatory capital levels, commensurate with the level and nature of the risks to which they are exposed. That amount of capital held in excess of minimum capital requirements should be commensurate with their firm‐specific risk profiles, and account for all material risks. The assessment of capital under the two macroeconomic scenarios being used in the capital assessment program will permit supervisors to ascertain whether the buffer over the regulatory capital minimum is appropriate under more severe but plausible scenarios. [...] An institution that requires additional capital will enter into a commitment to issue a CAP convertible preferred security to the U.S. Treasury in an amount sufficient to meet the capital requirement determined through the supervisory assessment. Each institution will be permitted up to six months to raise private capital in public markets to meet this requirement and would be able to cancel the capital commitment without penalty. The CAP convertible preferred securities will be converted into common equity shares on an as‐needed basis. Financial institutions that issued preferred capital under Treasury’s existing Capital Purchase Program (TARP 1) will have the option of redeeming those securities and replacing them with the new CAP convertible preferred securities. [...] The capital {{assessment is}} part of the supervisory process and thus subject to the same framework used for bank examinations or bank holding company inspections. There will be ample opportunity for discussions between the financial institutions and supervisory agencies regarding the loss estimates and earnings forecasts during the capital assessment process.|$|E

40|$|The {{valuation}} and hedging {{of participating}} life insurance policies, {{also known as}} with-profits policies, is considered.

The fair valuation of these policies is studied under the assumption that the insurance company has the right to modify the investment strategy of the <b>underlying</b> <b>portfolio</b> at any time. Fur-thermore, it is assumed that the issuer of the policy does not setup a separate portfolio to hedge the risk associated with the policy.

In that sense, the insurer’s investment portfolio serves simultaneously as the underlying security and as the hedge portfolio.

We allow for correlation between the default times of the investor, counterparty and <b>underlying</b> <b>portfolio</b> risk factors. We use arbitrage-free stochastic dynamical models. We then specialize our analysis to Credit Default Swaps (CDS) as <b>underlying</b> <b>portfolio,</b> generalizing the work of Brigo and Chourdakis (2008) [5] who deal with unilateral and asymmetric counterparty risk. We introduce stochastic intensity models and a trivariate copula function on the default times exponential variables to model default dependence. Similarly to [5], we find that both default correlation and credit spread volatilities have a relevant and structured impact on the adjustment. Differently from [5], the two parties will now agree on the credit valuation adjustment.

We find that while inflows of short-term bank loans are significantly explained by macroeconomic factors, exchange rate regime and liquidity of the banking sector, portfolio inflows seem to be meaningfully influenced only by the level of foreign GDP. We suggest two explanations for the latter result. First, the inability of aggregate data to capture the risk and expected profitability dimensions that typically <b>underlie</b> <b>portfolio</b> decisions. Second, portfolio capital in the form of bonds might react to interest rates other than the domestic and the European ones. During the last decade, the volume of short-term capital in the form of bank loans to the New and potential member States increased (with some heterogeneity across countries). In light of the econometric results, their vulnerability to reversals could be mitigated by adequate macroeconomic policies and further improvement of their financial sector.
