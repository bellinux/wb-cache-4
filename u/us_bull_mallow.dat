40|$|Combining foreign {{daughter}} {{data with}} domestic in-formation in dairy bull genetic evaluations {{has been shown}} to improve prediction of future domestic evalua-tions for <b>US</b> <b>bulls.</b> This study focused on the accuracy of Interbull evaluations of bulls with only foreign daughters, in predicting the latest domestic evaluations (based on US daughters). August 2003 USDA evalua-tions based only on US daughters were matched with the most recent February or August Interbull evalua-tions without US daughters. A minimum reliability of at least 80 % for yield and 70 % for somatic cell score (SCS) was required in both evaluations. This provided pairs of evaluations based on different daughters (for-eign or <b>US)</b> for 286 <b>bulls</b> (60 bulls for SCS). Mean In-terbull reliabilities on the US scale were 88 % for yield and 84 % for SCS, and the mean US reliability for the current evaluations was 91 % for yield and 80 % for SCS. Correlations between the Interbull and domestic evalu-ations were 0. 90, 0. 87, 0. 90, and 0. 87 for milk, fat, pro-tein, and SCS respectively. Expected correlations were 0. 89 for yield and 0. 82 for SCS. Mean differences be-tween the Interbull and current domestic evaluations were near zero. These foreign bulls had graduated from progeny test programs (selected for positive Mendelian sampling) before being marketed in the United States. Thus, parent average was a substantial underestimate ofmerit. The small average differences between evalua-tions from foreign and US daughters and high correla-tions indicate that Interbull evaluations based solely on foreign daughters are useful predictors of the US evaluations for yield and SCS, providing accuracy in agreement with reliabilities and much better estimates than the alternative, parent averages.

40|$|THE {{radiological}} {{diagnosis of}} basilar impression {{depends on the}} measurement of {{the relation of the}} upper parts of the cervical spine to the skull. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to compare three different mea-sures, and to discuss the familial distribution of primary basilar im-pression and the light that this throws on the validity of the three criteria. PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS The first criterion is that of Chamberlain (1939), who stated that in normal subjects "all parts of the atlas and axis lie caudad of the base line " drawn from the dorsal margin of the hard palate to the dorsal lip of the foramen magnum (Plate XXVII). Saunders(i 943) pointedoutthat there is a considerable range of variation in normal subjects, and found that in one person in three the tip of the odontoid lay above Chamber-lain's line. McGregor (1948) introduced a modification of Chamberlain's line, namely "the line drawn from the upper surface of the posterior edge of the hard palate to the most caudal point of the occipital curve in the true lateral X-ray " (Plate XXVIII). He found that this line was easier to draw with precision than Chamberlain's line, and that the dis-tance from it of the odontoid tip in normal subjects did not differ from the corresponding distance from Chamberlain's line by more than 3 mm. in anv one case. Fischgold and Metzger (1952) measured the relation of the tip of the odontoid to a line joining the tips of the mastoid pro-cesses and to a line joining the digastric grooves. In the present investigation their method has not been used for two reasons: first that it differs essentially from those of Chamberlain and McGregor only in that the arbitrary base line is drawn on an antero-posterior view of the skull, and secondly that it frequently requires the use of tomo-graphy. One of <b>us</b> (<b>Bull,</b> 1946, 1951) pointed out that in cases of basilar impression secondary to bone softening it is the weight-bearing parts of the occipital bone, namely the antero-lateral parts adjacent to the foramen magnum, which rise. Since the condylar portions of the atlas rise pari passu with the occipital condyles, it was suggested that the angl...|$|R

40|$|Average {{relationship}} coefficients {{between groups}} of animals were calculated by repeating three calculation steps until convergence was reached. The {{first step was}} a stratified sampling of pedigrees. Second, relationships between animals in the sample were calculated, using the group relationships computed in a previous round for unknown parent relationships. Third, results were accumulated by group. Average relationship coefficients calculated in this way {{can be used for}} such purposes as to better understand the structure of a population, to more accurately calculate inbreeding coefficients, and to assign unknown parent groups using clustering methods. This method was applied to the pedigree data for the worldwide Holstein sire population. The data was derived from Interbull and North American pedigree databases. Groups were defined by year of birth, sex, and country. Average relationships between <b>US</b> and Canadian <b>bulls</b> increased across time from 0. 02 in 1960 to 0. 12 in 1999. The increase was continuous except for a plateau in 1992, followed by a slight decrease until 1995 when the trend to increase resumed. Average relationships across time comparing Canadian with European <b>bulls</b> and <b>US</b> with European <b>bulls</b> are quite similar. They increased from about 0 in 1963 to 0. 10 in 1999. After a peak of 0. 05 in 1966, the relationships dropped to 0. 03 in 1976 before starting to increase again. For bulls born in 1996 in the US, Canada, and Germany (representing a typical European country), the average relationships were: 0. 116 (CanadaCanada), 0. 112 (Canada-USA), 0. 1 (Canada-Germany), 0. 101 (USA-USA), 0. 101 (USAGermany) and 0. 084 (Germany-Germany). These results demonstrate the recent dramatic increase in relationships and inbreeding in the worldwide Holstein population, and show the power of this method of calculating relationship coefficients.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare {{correlation}} matrices between direct genomic predictions for 31 traits at the genomic and chromosomal levels in <b>US</b> Holstein <b>bulls.</b> Multivariate factor analysis carried out at the genome level identified seven factors associated with conformation, longevity, yield, feet and legs, fat and protein content traits. Some differences were found at the chromosome level; variations in covariance structure on BTA 6, 14, 18 and 20 were interpreted as evidence of segregating QTL for different groups of traits. For example, milk yield and composition tended to join in a single factor on BTA 14, which is known to harbour the DGAT 1 locus that affects these traits. Another example was on BTA 18, where a factor strongly correlated with sire calving ease and conformation traits was identified. It is known that in US Holstein, there is a segregating QTL on BTA 18 influencing these traits. Moreover, a possible candidate gene for daughter pregnancy rate was suggested for BTA 28. The methodology proposed in this study could be used to identify individual chromosomes, which have covariance structures that differ from the overall (whole genome) covariance structure. Such differences can be difficult to detect when a large number of traits are evaluated, and covariances may be affected by QTL that do not have large allele substitution effects...|$|R
