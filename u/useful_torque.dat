40|$|The bus {{actuators}} are {{the heart}} {{and at the same}} time the Achilles' heel of accurate spacecraft stabilization systems, because both their performance and their perturbations can have a deciding influence on the achievable pointing accuracy of the mission. The main task of the attitude actuators, which are mostly wheels, is the generation of <b>useful</b> <b>torques</b> with sufficiently high bandwidth, resolution and accuracy. This is because the bandwidth of the whole attitude control loop and its disturbance rejection capability is dependent upon these factors. These <b>useful</b> <b>torques</b> shall be provided, without - as far as possible - parasitic noise like unbalance forces and torques and harmonics. This is because such variable frequency perturbations excite structural resonances which in turn disturb the operation of sensors and scientific instruments. High accuracy spacecraft will further require bus actuators for the three linear degrees of freedom (DOF) to damp structural oscillations excited by various sources. These actuators have to cover the dynamic range of these disturbances. Another interesting feature, which is not necessarily related to low noise performance, is a gimballing capability which enables, in a certain angular range, a three axis attitude control with only one wheel. The herein presented Teldix MWX, a five degree of freedom Magnetic Bearing Momentum Wheel, incorporates all the above required features. It is ideally suited to support, as a gyroscopic actuator in the attitude control system, all High Pointing Accuracy and Vibration Sensitive space missions...|$|R

Here the effective energy barrier E_eff scales with the single-macrospin energy barrier KV, where K is the effective anisotropy energy density and V the volume. A long-standing paradox in this field is that the actual energy barrier appears to be much smaller than this. It has been suggested that incoherent motions may lower the barrier, but this has proved difficult to quantify.

40|$|Abstract We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} finding a torque input command that achieves rest-to-rest motion in given time for a one-link flexible arm, avoiding residual vi-brations. In [7], we presented a method based on {{the definition of a}} system output having maximum relative degree (flat output), the planning of an interpolating poly-nomial trajectory for this output, and inverse dynamics computation of the required torque. However, the more flexible modes are considered, the higher becomes the order of the polynomials required in the trajectory planning step. This results in a peaking velocity effect, with very slow start and arrival phases, and thus in a waste of time and/or of <b>useful</b> <b>torque</b> capacities. A novel solution will be presented that enables to approximately minimize the transfer time under a maximum torque con-straint or minimize the torque needed for a given motion time. We modify the previ-ous method so as to generate torque profiles of the bang-bang type, but with smooth interpolating phases near the start, midpoint, and final instants. The method is illus-trated for an Euler-Bernoulli beam model of a one-link flexible arm with dynamic boundary conditions. Numerical results show the large benefits obtained with this solution. ...|$|E
40|$|A motor {{involves}} a simple design {{that can be}} embedded into a plate structure by incorporating ultrasonic horn actuators into the plate. The piezoelectric material that is integrated into the horns is pre-stressed with flexures. Piezoelectric actuators are attractive {{for their ability to}} generate precision high strokes, torques, and forces while operating under relatively harsh conditions (temperatures at single-digit K to as high as 1, 273 K). Electromagnetic motors (EM) typically have high rotational speed and low torque. In order to produce a <b>useful</b> <b>torque,</b> these motors are geared down to reduce the speed and increase the torque. This gearing adds mass and reduces the efficiency of the EM. Piezoelectric motors can be designed with high torques and lower speeds directly without the need for gears. Designs were developed for producing rotary motion based on the Barth concept of an ultrasonic horn driving a rotor. This idea was extended to a linear motor design by having the horns drive a slider. The unique feature of these motors is that they can be designed in a monolithic planar structure. The design is a unidirectional motor, which is driven by eight horn actuators, that rotates in the clockwise direction. There are two sets of flexures. The flexures around the piezoelectric material are pre-stress flexures and they pre-load the piezoelectric disks to maintain their being operated under compression when electric field is applied. The other set of flexures is a mounting flexure that attaches to the horn at the nodal point and can be designed to generate a normal force between the horn tip and the rotor so that to first order it operates independently and compensates for the wear between the horn and the rotor...|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} {{improved}} cryogenic components {{to be used}} in future spaceborne infrared astronomy missions was identified. Improved low noise cryogenic amplifiers operated with infrared detectors, and better cryogenic actuators and motors with extremely low power dissipation are needed.

40|$|Since the {{development}} of the CubeSat standard, the number of nanosatellites developed by universities, federal agencies and commercial companies has greatly increased as well as their mission complexity. This thesis focuses on {{the development}} of attitude control systems for nanosatellites. The central idea is to utilize the external disturbance forces as control input. Such technique is particular important for small and nanosatellites in low Earth orbit where the major disturbance torque, represented by the aerodynamic torque, limits the ability of spacecraft to maneuver and to achieve stabilization. The main contribution of this thesis is {{the development of}} a novel attitude control technique that uses active variation of the aerodynamic torque through center of mass shifting. By moving three shifting masses, the distances between the spacecraft's center of mass and the center of pressure of the spacecraft external surfaces can be modified, which results in changes in both magnitude and direction of the total aerodynamic torque acting on the satellite. In this fashion, the shifting masses can convert undesired aerodynamic disturbance into a <b>useful</b> control <b>torque</b> to stabilize spacecraft. In contrast to other actuators, the proposed attitude control system based on shifting masses is more efficient in environment with high disturbance, e. g., low Earth orbit. To achieve three-axis stabilization, a nonlinear adaptive feedback control is developed. The stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed using Lyapunov stability theory and demonstrated through simulations. The secondary contribution of this thesis is the application of the center of mass relocation to develop a novel automatic mass balancing system for spacecraft simulators. Spacecraft three-Axis simulators provide frictionless and, ideally, torque-free hardware simulation platforms that are crucial for validating spacecraft attitude, determination, and control strategies. To reduce the gravitational torque, the distance between the simulator center of mass and the center of rotation needs to be minimized. This work proposes an automatic mass balancing system for spacecraft simulators, which utilizes only the three shifting masses during the balancing process, without need of further actuators. The proposed method is based on an adaptive nonlinear feedback control that aims to move, in real-time, the center of mass towards the spacecraft simulator's center of rotation. The stability of the feedback system and the convergence of the estimated unknown parameter (the distance between the center of mass and the center of rotation) are analyzed. The proposed method is experimentally validated using the CubeSat Three-Axis Simulator at the Spacecraft Robotics Laboratories of the Naval Postgraduate School...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} the kinematics formulation {{of an internal}} combustion engine crank mechanism. The kinematics formulation of the crank mechanism is done using vector loop method and cosine rule are applied to describe {{the position of the}} piston. Following the velocity of piston and connecting rod is performed by differentiating the position in terms of the crank angle and connecting rod angle respectively. The acceleration equation with brief form is derived from the velocity in the same principle. Based on the kinematics, the equations of motion of crank mechanism components are formulated for each moving link and platform then, all motion parameters of each component about its crank angle are readily derived. Furthermore the 2 D model is provided by using 2 D Auto CAD software in order to visualize the system and mathematical algorithm solved by using software MATLAB. The forces acting on the crank mechanism and the torque applied are also formulated based on the angles of the crank and connecting rod. Introduction. The Internal combustion engine is those that burn their fuel which is mixture of air and petrol from carburetor inside the cylinder or compress air only on the cylinder and injects diesel from injector nozzle. These IC engines convert the chemical energy stored in their fuel into heat energy during the power stroke of piston. The energy produced from burning of fuel is used for motion of piston; the working of a four stroke engine is based on simple slider crank mechanism. The kinematics of IC engine is not altering from simple slider crank mechanism. The kinematics formulation of the crank mechanism such as piston motion and connecting rod motion utilizes different software and methodologies for which it is suitable for manipulation The crank mechanism comprised of components like crank shaft, connecting rod and piston which changes the sudden displacement to a smooth rotary output which is the input to many devices such as pumps generators and compressors. A detailed procedure of getting stresses in the fillet area of a crank mechanism particularly crank shaft was introduced by Henry et al. [1], in which FEM and BEM (Boundary Element Method) were used. Obtained stresses were ratified by experimental results on turbocharged compression ignition engine with Ricardo type combustion chamber configuration. The crank mechanism durability assessment tool used in this study was developed by RENAULT Guagliano et al. [2] conducted a study on a marine diesel engine crankshaft and connecting rod. Payer et al. [3] developed a two-step technique to perform nonlinear transient analysis of crank mechanism combining a beam-mass model and a solid element model and Prakash et al. [4] performed stress and fatigue analysis on three example parts belonging to three different classes of engines, light automotive crankshaft was studied by Borges et al. [5]. The geometry of the crank mechanism was geometrically restricted due to limitations in the computer resources available to the authors. Shenoy and Fatemi [6] conducted dynamic analysis of loads in the connecting rod and piston components, which is in contact with the crankshaft. Dynamic analysis of the connecting rod is similar to dynamics of the crankshaft, since these components form a slide-crank mechanism and the connecting rod motion applies dynamic load on the crank-pin bearing [...] Shenoy and Fatemi [7] optimized the crank mechanism considering dynamic service load on the component. It was shown that dynamic analysis is the proper basis for fatigue performance calculation and optimization of dynamically loaded components. A literature survey by Zoroufi and Fatemi [8] focused on durability performance evaluation and comparisons of forged steel and cast iron crankshafts. The piston-connecting rod-crankshaft assembly in the reciprocating piston-engines is used to transform the gas forces generated during combustion within the working cylinder into a piston stroke, which the crankshafts converts into <b>useful</b> <b>torque</b> available at the flywheel.

40|$|When the new Volvo S/V 60 was {{released}} it was marketed as a sporty and dynamic car. The chassis and {{handling of the}} car makes it enjoyable and it communicates in a direct fashion with the driver which is greatly appreciated by journalists and enthusiast car drivers. The great reception of the car encouraged to investigate what {{that could be done}} within driveline control {{in order to make it}} even more fun to drive. In this thesis the following enthusiast features are developed and tested: Launch control, down shift support, controlled exhaust detonations during shifts, injection cuts for sound and response reasons, distinct/sporty accelerator pedal characteristics in neutral and a system for increasing the response of the engine after gear change. All features are implemented within the engine controller. Models for the new functionality were developed in Matlab/Simulink. The launch control was simulated using VSim, a Volvo developed tool for longitudinal vehicle analyses. For the functionalities not well represented by VSim, measurement data from the test vehicle was run through the models to verify that the output signals were correct. The Simulink models were then adapted to the ECM and implemented into a test vehicle. The test vehicle used was a Volvo S 80 with a 2. 5 liter turbocharged port fuel injected five cylinder engine, manual transmission and a Denso ECM. The testing and calibration was conducted on test tracks, regular roads and in a chassis dynamometer. The result of the addition of new features is a car that is more fun to drive, offers quicker acceleration, better response and gives a more direct and sporty impression. Use of launch control gives quick and repetitive 0 - 100 km/h times. The time to regain boost after gear change is reduced by 0. 3 seconds and boost pressure never drops below 160 kPa absolute pressure with the response system active. The "Skip stroke" injection cut strategy proved to be <b>useful</b> for building <b>torque</b> reserves with very moderate exhaust temperatures. The down shift support gives a smoother and more stable ride while letting the driver impress his friends with his down shifting skills.
