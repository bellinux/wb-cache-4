40|$|Remote sensing {{data have}} been used in {{previous}} studies to assess the effects of winter ecological conditions in Africa on biological parameters recorded in bird populations during the following breeding season in Europe. Based on the results of these studies, we hypothesized that a high productivity of vegetation during the winter and, thus, high resource availability, should advance the arrival of long-distance migrants to the European breeding areas due to enhanced ecological conditions. To test this hypothesis, between 1982 and 2000 we examined the first arrival date to the Iberian Peninsula of five species (White Stork, Cuckoo, Common Swift, Barn Swallow and Nightingale) in relation to several explanatory variables: ecological conditions in their African wintering grounds and <b>passage</b> <b>areas,</b> as reflected by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), temperature and precipitation in their <b>passage</b> <b>areas</b> and the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Ecological conditions in the wintering areas were important for White Stork, Cuckoo and Barn Swallow phenology, while both NDVI in <b>passage</b> <b>areas</b> and NAO did not have an effect on any species. Migratory birds arrived earlier after winters with high vegetation productivity in Africa. Temperature in <b>passage</b> <b>areas</b> was important for the later species (i. e. Cuckoo, Common Swift and Nightingale), although in all cases the true relevance of this factor was scarce due to the poor explanatory capacity of the models. These species were recorded in the Iberian Peninsula earlier in the spring of those years with warmer temperatures in <b>passage</b> <b>areas.</b> The nexus between African NDVI and arrival phenology is hypothesized through increases in wintering survival rates and/or the faster acquisition of pre-migratory body condition and progression through sub-Saharan areas.

An idealized expansion wave, an idealized inlet port, and an idealized compression stage are considered. It is found that area variation does not have a very significant effect on the expansion wave, nor on the compression stage. For the expansion wave, increasing the <b>passage</b> <b>area</b> in the flow direction has the same effect as a diffuser, so that the flow emerges at a lower velocity than it would for the constant area case. This could be advantageous. The inlet is strongly affected by the area variation, as it changes the strength of the hammer shock wave, thereby changing the pressure behind it.

40|$|Protein {{translocation}} in Escherichia coli {{is mediated}} by the translocase that in its minimal form consists of the protein-conducting channel SecYEG, and the motor protein, SecA. SecYEG forms a narrow pore in the membrane that allows passage of unfolded proteins only. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the maximal width of the central pore of SecYEG is limited to 16 Å. To access the functional size of the SecYEG pore, the precursor of outer membrane protein A was modified with rigid spherical tetraarylmethane derivatives of different diameters at a unique cysteine residue. SecYEG allowed the <b>unrestricted</b> <b>passage</b> of the precursor of outer membrane protein A conjugates carrying tetraarylmethanes with diameters up to 18 Å, whereas a 29 Å sized molecule blocked the translocation pore. Translocation of the protein-organic molecule hybrids was strictly proton motive force-dependent and occurred at a single pore. With an average diameter of an unfolded polypeptide chain of 4 – 6 Å, the pore accommodates structures of at least 22 – 24 Å, which is vastly larger than the predicted maximal width of a single pore by molecular dynamics simulations. ...|$|R
40|$|Performance {{analysis}} {{has been carried}} out on a high side scroll compressor having a fixed scroll equipped with a circular oil groove on its thrust surface. Oil is supplied to the oil groove through an intermittent opening from a high pressure oil reservoir formed inside the orbiting scroll hub. Oil in the groove is then delivered to both suction and back pressure chambers by pressure differentials and viscous pumping action of the orbiting scroll base plate. Mathematical modeling of this oil groove system has been incorporated into main compressor performance simulation program for optimum oil groove design. Pressure in the oil groove can be controlled by changing the oil <b>passage</b> <b>area</b> and oil groove configuration. With an enlarged oil passage, pressure in the oil groove increases due to increased flow rate, but pressure increase in the back pressure chamber is not that large, resulting in reduced friction loss at the thrust surface between the two scrolls. On the other hand, by increasing the oil <b>passage</b> <b>area,</b> oil content in the refrigerant flow increases, and the orbiting scroll stability could be negatively affected by oil groove pressure increase.

Specifically, the Minas <b>Passage</b> <b>area</b> of the Bay of Fundy has been selected for tidal energy research, where tidal energy may be harnessed without a great environmental impact.

40|$|Small and midsize {{turbines}} {{are widely}} used in various sectors of economics for electricity generation or as mechanical drivers. The small volume flow rate of these machines at the inlet requires a small minimal <b>passage</b> <b>area</b> for the first or some upstream stages. This leads to short blade heights and small gauging angles that together compose the <b>passage</b> <b>area</b> and result in significant effi-ciency reduction. A well-known approach to avoid this is to admit steam to {{the part of the}} arc. The partial admission is widely used in the first (control) stage and sometimes even for the group of stages in small turbines. In general, the efficiency of the first partial stage and downstream located stages depends on many parameters. Some major parameters are as follows: total level of admission partiality, number and tangential location of admission arcs, and geometry of mixing chambers between first and downstream located stages. Proper combination of the above mentioned parameters may lead to improvements in turbine performance. In this article, the interaction of the control stage with partial admission and one downstream stage without partial admission for a high-speed mechanical drive turbine is considered.

During dissection of the shoulder region we recognized a vein travelling on the inferior border of the suprascapular notch together with the suprascapular nerve. The aim of this work was to evaluate the morphological characteristics of this vein in cadaveric material. Materials and methodsThe suprascapular notch (SSN) region was dissected in 60 cadaveric shoulders. The course, number and diameter of nerve and vessels in the suprascapluar notch region were evaluated. Length, proximal and distal width of the superior transverse scapular ligament were measured. Photographic documentation was taken to evaluate the suprascapular nerve <b>passage</b> <b>area.</b> ResultsThe vein identified was named as the suprascapular notch vein. It was present in 58. 3 % of shoulders. In 11 specimens, it was double. Its mean diameter was 1. 7 mm (SD 0. 7 mm) and did not correlate with the suprascapular nerve <b>passage</b> <b>area.</b> A suprascapular notch vein co-occurred more often with the anterior coracoscapular ligament (ACSL). In comparison with the SSN without the ACSL, it has a significantly greater diameter (2 mm; SD 0. 7 mm vs 1. 5 mm; SD 0. 6 mm, respectively; P= 0. 021). ConclusionsThe suprascapular notch vein was a common structure that did not replace the suprascapular vein.

40|$|Accurate {{simulation}} models of gerotor pumps require knowledge of geometric features of these units. Instantaneous volumes of chambers {{as well as}} their volume derivatives lead to kinematic flow rate, flow ripple index, displacement. Flow <b>passage</b> <b>areas</b> between a chamber and the inlet/delivery volumes during a complete shaft revolution also need to be known. General analytical methods (integral-derivative and derivative-integral) have been developed for the calculation of geometric quantities of gear as well as vane pumps and will be reported in the paper with specific emphasis on gerotor units. The approach leading to these geometric informations has traditionally been grounded on a 2 D analysis of involved features. However, in the last decade, there has been a progressive and relentless development and use of 3 D CAD software that has led to the possibility of having at hand a virtual representation of these positive displacement machines. Accordingly, a novel method that requires the 3 D model of the gerotor pump is presented and the paper demonstrates how geometric features of the unit can be obtained. Main characteristics of this methodology are the use of parametric relations that define the relative position of the rotating gears, and the use of virtual components. A validation of this proposed approach is discussed contrasting analytic and CAD-model based outcomes. This methodology has been successful also in axial piston machines {{as well as for the}} determination of flow <b>passage</b> <b>areas</b> of complex proportional direction spool valve...|$|R

We assessed the prolonged swimming performance of a small-bodied fish, empire gudgeon (Hypseleotris compressa; 3. 2 - 7. 7 cm total length, TL), and juvenile Australian bass (Percalates novemaculeata; 3. 5 - 7. 8 cm TL). Swimming trials were conducted in a hydraulic flume {{across a range of}} fixed and increasing velocities in response to acute and long-term thermal treatments. A new statistical approach (Tobit analysis) was used to relate the thermal dependence of swimming endurance to hydraulic characteristics of culverts, providing estimates of maximum water velocity allowing upstream fish passage. Reductions in water temperature of 10 °C, similar to those caused by cold-water releases from dams, significantly impaired critical swimming speeds of both species. Traversable water-velocity models identified H. compressa as a weak swimmer, requiring very low water velocities (≤ 0. 10 ms- 1 or 2. 86 body lengths (BL) s- 1) for <b>unrestricted</b> <b>passage,</b> whereas P. novemaculeata was predicted to traverse water velocities of ≤ 0. 39 ms- 1 or 12. 12 BLs- 1.
