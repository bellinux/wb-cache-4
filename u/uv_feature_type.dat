40|$|In {{order to}} realize the {{non-contact}} measurement of ceramic insulator contamination severity, a method based on feature level fusion of infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) image information is proposed in this paper. IR and UV images of artificially polluted insulators were obtained from high voltage experiments at 80 %, 85 % and 90 % RH. After the preprocessing of images, IR and <b>UV</b> <b>features</b> were calculated, respectively. Then, feature selection based on Fisher criterion was adopted to gain features, which {{have the ability to}} distinguish different contamination grades effectively. In feature level fusion section, kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) was applied to the dimensionality reduction fusion of IR and <b>UV</b> <b>features</b> and obtain three-dimensional fused features. A particle swarm optimized back propagation neural network (PSO-BPNN) classifier was constructed and trained to recognize the contamination grades. Experimental results indicate that the feature level fusion of IR and UV information based on KPCA has capability to characterize the contamination grades comprehensively. Compared with recognition using IR or <b>UV</b> <b>features</b> separately, recognition based on the feature level fusion is more accurate and effective. This study provides a new methodology for the measurement of insulator contamination severity at working condition...|$|R

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, each <b>feature</b> <b>type</b> {{describes}} image {{from a single}} cue and has its own specific property- and domain-specific meaning. Different from a scalar <b>feature,</b> <b>feature</b> <b>types,</b> which can be scalars, vectors, or matrices, are highly diverse in dimension and expression. However, existing methods simply ensemble the selection of each <b>feature</b> <b>type</b> [13] or concatenate all <b>features</b> <b>types</b> into a single vector [14]. These methods ignore the relation between different <b>feature</b> <b>types.</b> Moreover, they often select a common feature subset for all classes, while the feature subset might not be optimal for each class. According to ref. [14], one-versus-all strategy is employed to select class-specific features. Feature selection selects a subset from original features rather than obtain a low-dimensional subspace, thereby maintaining the physical meaning, which is beneficial for understanding of data [4]. Therefore, how to select a set of <b>feature</b> <b>types</b> and evaluate the contribution of these types for a specific class is critical for enhancing their interpretability of features.|$|R

Constraints on the {{possible}} shape and clustering, as well as optical properties, of grains responsible for the 2175 ˚A interstellar extinction <b>feature</b> (interstellar <b>UV</b> bump) are discussed. These constraints {{are based on the}} observation that the peak position of the interstellar <b>UV</b> <b>feature</b> is very stable (variations ∼ 1 %), that the large variations in width (< ∼ 25 %) are uncorrelated with the peak position except for the widest bumps, and that the shape of the feature is described extremely well by a Drude profile. The UV extinction of small graphite grains is computed for various clustering models involving Rayleigh spheres. It is shown that compact clusters qualitatively satisfy the above observational constraints, except that the peak position falls at the wrong wavelength. As an alternative to graphite to model the optical properties of the interstellar <b>UV</b> <b>feature</b> carrier, a single-Lorentz oscillator model is considered, in conjunction with a clustering model based on clusters of spheres. Intrinsic changes in the peak position and width are attributed to variations in chemical composition of the grains, impacting upon the parameters of the Lorentz oscillator.
