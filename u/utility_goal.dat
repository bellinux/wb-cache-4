To the historic players of the social economy such as non-profit organizations, mutual benefit groups, and foundations are added enterprises which follow a social <b>utility</b> <b>goal</b> (social business) applying social economy principles. Until now, social and technological innovations have been distinctly studied and even mutually opposed (European Commission, 2010  ; Durance et Mousli, 2010  ; Dandurand, 2005, vol. 115, n° 3, p. 377) when these two scientific disciplines should be more related for the first time. The social and technological innovations within the social economy program (STISE) combine for the first time these two scientific approaches in order to develop innovations. Indeed, innovations are many in social economy but they are not enhanced or poorly large outspread on a large scale. Conversely, technological innovations follow a well-defined process to achieve or sustain profitability. From these observations, STISE program’s researchers have developed the hypothesis that technological innovations could be even more efficient if some social economy functioning was considered. In the same way innovations in social economy would gain organizing their innovation process so as to get strengthened and spread out. So, the program aims to link different economic sectors to promote mutual knowledge and identify the obstacles and good practices in an innovation process and to examine mutual reliance or the lack of links between the players involved into the program. Based on the experience of the action-research of STISE program, the first part introduces the players involvement in the research program, with on one hand the scientific cross-disciplinary {{and on the other hand}} the diversity of field workers.

40|$|While {{third-party}} tracking {{on the web}} has garnered much attention, its workings remain poorly understood. Our goal is {{to dissect}} how mainstream web tracking occurs in the wild. We develop a client-side method for detecting and classifying five kinds of third-party trackers based on how they manipulate browser state. We run our detection system while browsing the web and observe a rich ecosystem, with over 500 unique trackers in our measurements alone. We find that most commercial pages are tracked by multiple parties, trackers vary widely in their coverage with a small number being widely deployed, and many trackers exhibit a combination of tracking behaviors. Based on web search traces taken from AOL data, we estimate that several trackers can each capture more than 20 % of a user’s browsing behavior. We further {{assess the impact of}} defenses on tracking and find that no existing browser mechanisms prevent tracking by social media sites via widgets while still allowing those widgets to achieve their <b>utility</b> <b>goals,</b> which leads us to develop a new defense. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the most complete study of web tracking to date. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Although {{the goal}} of {{pervasive}} data sharing has persisted for over a decade, most large-scale efforts fail to reach the critical mass of participation necessary to sustain it due to the excessive costs involved. These costs often stem {{from the lack of}} standardized methodology and tools to implement disclosure controls that address data sharing risks. We present a framework that addresses the problem comprehensively by considering policy level risk (e. g., NDAs) and technical (e. g., data anonymization) disclosure control issues in concert. Doing so facilitates a superior balance of utility and risk mitigation by ensuring that policy and technical approaches complement one another. Moreover, the framework is driven by the pragmatic <b>utility</b> <b>goals</b> of the data release rather than general risk factors, which helps to focus the effort on exactly those parts of the data necessary to achieve desired goals. The output of the framework is a standardized audit trail and description of the data sharing scenario, which enables the reuse of key components in other data sharing efforts. The framework greatly decreases the data publisher’s overall costs while simultaneously enabling a more evolved and effective balance between utility and risk management in data sharing. I...|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} conceptualizations and formalizations of {{decision}} making. In this paper we compare classical decision theory with qualitative decision theory, knowledge-based systems and belief-desire-intention models developed in artificial intelligence and agent theory. They all contain representations {{of information and}} motivation. Examples of informational attitudes are probability distributions, qualitative abstractions of probabilities, knowledge, and beliefs. Examples of motivational attitudes are utility functions, qualitative abstractions of <b>utilities,</b> <b>goals,</b> and desires. Each of them encodes a set of alternatives to be chosen from. This ranges from a small predetermined set, a set of decision variables, through logical formulas, to branches of a tree representing events through time. Moreover, they {{have a way of}} formulating how a decision is made. Classical and qualitative decision theory focus on the optimal decisions represented by a decision rule. Knowledge-based systems and belief-desire-intention models focus on a model of the representations used in decision making, inspired by cognitive notions like belief, desire, goal and intention. Relations among these concepts express an agent type, which constrains the deliberation process. We also consider the relation between decision processes and intentions, and the relation between game theory and norms and commitments...|$|R
40|$|Storage {{virtualization}} {{in modern}} storage systems allows {{variability in the}} number of “physical ” disks supporting a single “virtual ” disk. In practice, IO workloads vary with time. Presuming the evolution of reasonable predic-tive models with the power of accurately predicting IO workload, it may be argued that it is straightforward to compute the number of disks needed at any time to satisfy QoS constraints. However, because disks contain data, the data also needs to be reallocated amongst disks. Not only does data migration need to be scheduled ahead but it must also be scheduled {{in such a way that}} QoS violations do not occur because of the extra migration IOs. In this paper, we present a novel analytic framework, PULSTORE, for autonomically managing the storage to balance both cost and performance. Given the workload characteristics of an application and storage QoS requirements, our PULSTORE framework yields an optimal schedule for adding and removing disks to support a time varying IO workload without QoS violations. A case study based on real IO traces shows that PULSTORE is very effective in achieving both QoS and <b>utility</b> <b>goals.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an approach for optimizing over interdependent planning goals. Most planning systems allow only simple, static dependencies {{to be defined}} among goals where these dependencies remain constant between different problems. However, in many domains, goals are related through detailed utility models that may significantly change from problem to problem. For instance in one problem, a particular <b>goal’s</b> <b>utility</b> may increase if other related goals can be achieved. In another problem, this utility increase may differ or actually decrease if the same combination of goals is achieved. To address these types of problem situations, we have implemented a methodology for representing and utilizing information about interdependent goals and their related utilities using the ASPEN planning and scheduling system. We show through experimental results that this approach significantly increases overall plan quality versus a standard approach that treats <b>goal</b> <b>utilities</b> independently...|$|R

40|$|Urban water {{management}} specifies both supply-side and demand-side strategies to balance {{water supply and}} demands for social and environmental systems. As the sustainability of water resources depends on the dynamic interactions among the consumers and the policy makers of the water system, an optimal adaptive {{water management}} approach {{can be used to}} update utility decisions based on the feedback among these systems and may enable a more efficient use of resources. Adaptive demand-side management strategies, such as regulating water for outdoor use, can be designed with increasing restrictions corresponding to the depletion of reservoirs. Similarly, adaptive supply-side strategies can be designed to supplement supply by increasing the volume of water that is transferred among basins when reservoirs levels drop. In this study, a Complex adaptive system (CAS) framework is used to simulate the adaptive behaviors of consumers, the adaptive decisions of the water utility, and an engineering model of the water supply infrastructure. The CAS framework is coupled with an optimization methodology to evaluate a combination of supply-side and demand-side adaptive water management strategies in achieving the <b>utilities</b> <b>goal</b> of minimizing management costs. The methodology is applied to an illustrative case study of an urban water supply system to explore optimal adaptive water management strategies. The results indicate that while the management costs could be minimized through implementation of optimal supply-side and demand-side strategies, those strategies also resulted in reservoir depletion significantly below the conservation storage. Thus, a trade-off exists between the supply-side and the demand-side management of urban water resources...|$|R
40|$|Part 4 : Protection and Privacy of Data and Big DataInternational audienceExciting {{advances}} in big data analysis suggest that sharing personal information, {{such as health}} and location data, among multiple other parties could have significant societal benefits. However, privacy issues often hinder data sharing. Recently, differential privacy emerged as an important tool to preserve privacy while sharing privacy-sensitive data. The basic idea is simple. Differential privacy guarantees that results learned from shared data do not change much based on the inclusion or exclusion of any single person’s data. Despite the promise, existing differential privacy techniques addresses specific <b>utility</b> <b>goals</b> and/or query types (e. g., count queries), {{so it is not}} clear whether they can preserve utility for arbitrary types of queries. To better understand possible utility and privacy tradeoffs using differential privacy, we examined uses of human mobility data in a real-world competition. Participants were asked to come up with insightful ideas that leveraged a minimally protected published dataset. An obvious question is whether contest submissions could yield the same results if performed on a dataset protected by differential privacy? To answer this question, we studied synthetic dataset generation models for human mobility data using differential privacy. We discuss utility evaluation and the generality of the models extensively. Finally, we analyzed whether the proposed differential privacy models could be used in practice by examining contest submissions. Our results indicate that most of the competition submissions could be replicated using differentially private data with nearly the same utility and with privacy guarantees. Statistical comparisons with the original dataset demonstrate that differentially private synthetic versions of human mobility data can be widely applicable for data analysis...|$|R

In contrast, in Stochastic Submodular Cover, the variables of the input distribution are assumed to be independent, and the distribution of each variable is given as input. Building on algorithms developed by Cicalese et al. and Golovin and Krause for related problems, we give two approximation algorithms for Scenario Submodular Cover over discrete distributions.

40|$|Abstract. Goal {{models have}} found {{important}} applications in Requirements Engineering as models that relate stakeholder requirements with system or human tasks needed to fulfill them.
