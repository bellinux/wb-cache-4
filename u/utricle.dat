5|$|Parts of the {{otic vesicle}} in turn form the vestibulocochlear nerve. These form bipolar neurons which supply {{sensation}} {{to parts of}} the inner ear (namely the sensory parts of the semicircular canals, macular of the <b>utricle</b> and saccule, and organ of Corti). The nerve begins to form around the 28th day.|$|E
5|$|Around the 33rd day of development, the vesicles {{begin to}} {{differentiate}}. Closer {{to the back}} of the embryo, they form what will become the <b>utricle</b> and semicircular canals. Closer to the front of the embryo, the vesicles differentiate into a rudimentary saccule, which will eventually become the saccule and cochlea. Part of the saccule will eventually give rise and connect to the cochlear duct. This duct appears approximately during the sixth week and connects to the saccule through the ductus reuniens.|$|E
5|$|Static {{balance is}} {{provided}} by two ventricles, the <b>utricle</b> and the saccule. Cells lining the walls of these ventricles contain fine filaments, and the cells are covered with a fine gelatinous layer. Each cell has 50–70 small filaments, and one large filament, the kinocilium. Within the gelatinous layer lie otoliths, tiny formations of calcium carbonate. When a person moves, these otoliths shift position. This shift alters {{the positions of the}} filaments, which opens ion channels within the cell membranes, creating depolarisation and an action potential that is transmitted to the brain along the vestibulocochlear nerve.|$|E
60|$|A bladder was now experimented on, {{which was}} already {{somewhat}} affected by the surrounding water; for the spherical glands, though colourless, had their primordial <b>utricles</b> slightly shrunk; and the oblong glands were brownish, with their <b>utricles</b> much, but irregularly, shrunk. The summit was treated with the solution of urea, but was little affected by it in 9 hrs.; nevertheless, after 23 hrs. the spherical glands were brown, with their <b>utricles</b> more shrunk; several of the other glands were still browner, with their <b>utricles</b> contracted into irregular little masses.|$|R
40|$|A {{re-examination}} of {{the four}} genera that comprise the Scinaia assemblage – Scinaia Bivona-Bernardi, Gloiophloea J. Agardh, Pseudoscinaia Setchell and Pseudogloiophloea Levring – has shown that both Pseudogloiophloea and Pseudoscinaia lack features that warrant independent generic status. Scinaia, Gloiophloea and Pseudogloiophloea have been separated from one another solely on cortical differences. Scinaia produces a cortex composed of either a mixture of inflated <b>utricles</b> and smaller cells (Scinaia forcellata Bivona-Bernardi) or of inflated <b>utricles</b> only (all other present species). In contrast, the cortex of Gloiophloea completely lacks <b>utricles.</b> Pseudogloiophloea supposedly differs from Scinaia in that its cortex is composed of a mixture of inflated <b>utricles</b> and conspicuously smaller (often pigmented) cells. This kind of cortex, however, is essentially identical to that found in S. forcellata, the type of the genus Scinaia. Pseudoscinaia was separated from Scinaia because its cystocarp supposedly has gonimoblast filaments lining {{the walls of the}} cystocarp cavity, rather than projecting centrally into the cavity. A re-examination of the type specimen, however, has shown that the cystocarp is essentially identical to that of Scinaia. It is concluded, therefore, that the Scinaia assemblage is comprised of only the two genera Scinaia (with cortical <b>utricles</b> to some degree) and Gloiophloea (completely lacking <b>utricles).</b> Recent proposals to erect the order Galaxaurales (as Chaetangiales) are rejected {{on the grounds that the}} gonimoblast initials in all genera studied arise directly from the carpogonium and not the hypogynous cell as has been previously claimed...|$|R
40|$|Reactive {{oxygen species}} are {{involved}} in inner ear hair cell death induced by aminoglycosides. Therefore, inhibition of free radicals can prevent hair cell death. The antioxidant, edaravone has been used clinically in Japan. In this study, we evaluated whether edaravone can protect hair cells against aminoglycoside-induced cytotoxicity in cultured mouse <b>utricles.</b> <b>Utricles</b> from CBA/N mice were cultured in medium containing neomycin alone (1 mM), or neomycin plus edaravone. Hair cells cultured with neomycin alone were damaged after 24 hours. Survival of hair cells cultured with neomycin plus edaravone (30 or 100 μM) was significantly {{greater than that of}} hair cells cultured with neomycin alone. Immunohistochemistry showed the production of 4 -hydroxy- 2 -nonenal in <b>utricles</b> cultured with neomycin but not in <b>utricles</b> cultured with neomycin plus edaravone (100 μM). These results suggest that the inhibibion of reactive oxygen species production by edaravone protects hair cells. In addition, high concentrations of edaravone did no show cytotoxicity...|$|R
5|$|The human ear {{consists}} of three parts—the outer ear, middle ear and inner ear. The ear canal of the outer ear is separated from the air-filled tympanic cavity {{of the middle ear}} by the eardrum. The middle ear contains the three small bones—the ossicles—involved in the transmission of sound, and is connected to the throat at the nasopharynx, via the pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube. The inner ear contains the otolith organs—the <b>utricle</b> and saccule—and the semicircular canals belonging to the vestibular system, as well as the cochlea of the auditory system.|$|E
5|$|The {{inner ear}} sits within the {{temporal}} bone in a complex cavity called the bony labyrinth. A central area known as the vestibule contains two small fluid-filled recesses, the <b>utricle</b> and saccule. These connect to the semicircular canals and the cochlea. There are three semicircular canals angled {{at right angles to}} each other which are responsible for dynamic balance. The cochlea is a spiral shell-shaped organ responsible for the sense of hearing. These structures together create the membranous labyrinth.|$|E
5|$|The bony {{labyrinth}} {{refers to}} the bony compartment which contains the membranous labyrinth, contained within the temporal bone. The inner ear structurally begins at the oval window, which receives vibrations from the incus of the middle ear. Vibrations are transmitted into the inner ear into a fluid called endolymph, which fills the membranous labyrinth. The endolymph is situated in two vestibules, the <b>utricle</b> and saccule, and eventually transmits to the cochlea, a spiral-shaped structure. The cochlea consists of three fluid-filled spaces: the vestibular duct, the cochlear duct, and the tympanic duct. Hair cells responsible for transduction—changing mechanical changes into electrical stimuli {{are present in the}} organ of Corti in the cochlea.|$|E

25|$|Endolymphatic infillings such as {{otoliths}} are {{structures in}} the saccule and <b>utricle</b> of the inner ear, specifically in the vestibular labyrinth of all vertebrates (fish, amphibians, reptiles, mammals and birds). In vertebrates, the saccule and <b>utricle</b> together make the otolith organs. Both statoconia and otoliths are used as gravity, balance, movement, and directional indicators in all vertebrates and have a secondary function in sound detection in higher aquatic and terrestrial vertebrates. They are sensitive to gravity and linear acceleration. Because of their orientation in the head, the <b>utricle</b> is sensitive {{to a change in}} horizontal movement, and the saccule gives information about vertical acceleration (such as when in an elevator).|$|E
25|$|The {{auditory}} vesicle will {{give rise to}} the utricular and saccular components of the membranous labyrinth.

60|$|The {{summit of}} another bladder, the glands {{of which were}} in a beautifully clear condition, was {{irrigated}} with {{a few drops of}} a mixed solution of nitrate and phosphate of ammonia, each of one part to 437 of water. After 2 hrs. some few of the glands were brownish. After 8 hrs. almost all the oblong glands were brown and much more opaque than they were before; their primordial <b>utricles</b> were somewhat shrunk and contained a little aggregated granular matter. The spherical glands were still white, but their <b>utricles</b> were broken up into three or four small hyaline spheres, with an irregularly contracted mass {{in the middle of the}} basal part. These smaller spheres changed their forms in the course of a few hours and some of them disappeared. By the next morning, after 23 hrs. 30 m., they had all disappeared, and the glands were brown; their <b>utricles</b> now formed a globular shrunken mass in the middle. The <b>utricles</b> of the oblong glands had shrunk very little, but their contents were somewhat aggregated. Lastly, the summit of a bladder which had been previously irrigated for 21 hrs. with a solution of one part of sugar to 218 of water without being affected, was treated with the above mixed solution; and after 8 hrs. 30 m. all the glands became brown, with their primordial <b>utricles</b> slightly shrunk.|$|R

After 2 hrs. 25 m. the spherical glands were still colourless; whilst the oblong and two-armed ones were of a brownish tint, and their primordial <b>utricles</b> much shrunk, some containing distinctly visible granules. After 9 hrs. some of the spherical glands were brownish, and the oblong glands were still more changed, but they contained fewer separate granules; their nuclei, on the other hand, appeared larger, as if they had absorbed the granules.

25|$|Although {{many fish}} {{are capable of}} hearing, the lagena is, at best, a short {{diverticulum}} of the saccule, and appears to have no role in sensation of sound. Various clusters of hair cells within the inner ear may instead be responsible; for example, bony fish contain a sensory cluster called the macula neglecta in the <b>utricle</b> that may have this function. Although fish have neither an outer nor a middle ear, sound may still be transmitted to the inner ear through {{the bones of the}} skull, or by the swim bladder, parts of which often lie close by in the body.|$|E
25|$|Movement {{of fluid}} in the semicircular canals signals the brain about the {{direction}} and speed of rotation of the head – for example, whether we are nodding our head up and down or looking from right to left. Each semicircular canal has a bulbed end, or enlarged portion, that contains hair cells. Rotation of the head causes a flow of fluid, which in turn causes displacement of the top portion of the hair cells that are embedded in the jelly-like cupula. Two other organs {{that are part of}} the vestibular system are the <b>utricle</b> and saccule. These are called the otolithic organs and are responsible for detecting linear acceleration, or movement in a straight line. The hair cells of the otolithic organs are blanketed with a jelly-like layer studded with tiny calcium stones called otoconia. When the head is tilted or the body position is changed with respect to gravity, the displacement of the stones causes the hair cells to bend.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} that the vestibular system of mammals has retained some of its ancestral acoustic sensitivity and that this sensitivity is mediated by the otolithic organs (most likely the sacculus, due to its anatomical location). In mice lacking the otoconia of the <b>utricle</b> and saccule, this retained acoustic sensitivity is lost. In humans vestibular evoked myogenic potentials occur in response to loud, low frequency acoustic stimulation in patients with sensorineural hearing loss. Vestibular sensitivity to ultrasonic sounds has also been hypothesised {{to be involved in the}} perception of speech presented at artificially high frequencies, above the range of the human cochlea (~18kHz). In mice sensation of acoustic information via the vestibular system has been demonstrated to have a behaviourally relevant effect; response to an elicited acoustic startle reflex is larger in the presence of loud, low frequency sounds that are below the threshold for the mouse cochlea (~4Hz), raising the possibility that the acoustic sensitivity of the vestibular system may extend the hearing range of small mammals.|$|E
60|$|Four summits were {{irrigated}} with {{a solution}} of one part of nitrate of ammonia to 437 of water.

In the second specimen, the primordial <b>utricles</b> were considerably shrunk and brownish after 2 hrs. Similar effects were observed in the two other specimens, but these were not examined until 21 hrs. had elapsed. The nuclei of many of the glands apparently had increased in size. Five bladders on a branch, which had been kept {{for a long time in}} moderately pure water, were cut off and examined, and their glands found very little modified.

40|$|PROPRIETARY INTEREST STATEMENT: The {{authors have}} no {{proprietary}} interest in {{any aspect of}} this report. Mechanosensory hair cells are susceptible to apoptotic death in response to exposure to ototoxic drugs, including aminoglycoside antibiotics. The c-Jun n-terminal kinase (JNK) is a stress-activated protein kinase that can promote apoptotic cell death {{in a variety of}} systems. Inhibition of the JNK signaling pathway can prevent aminoglycoside-induced death of cochlear and vestibular sensory hair cells. We used an in vitro preparation of <b>utricles</b> from adult mice to examine the role of JNK activation in aminoglycoside-induced hair cell death. CEP- 11004 was used as an indirect inhibitor of JNK signaling. Immunohistochemistry showed that both JNK and its downstream target c-Jun are phosphorylated in hair cells of <b>utricles</b> exposed to neomycin. CEP- 11004 inhibited neomycin-induced phosphorylation of both JNK and c-Jun. CEP- 11004 inhibited hair cell death in <b>utricles</b> exposed to moderate doses of neomycin. However, the results were not uniform across the dose-response function; CEP- 11004 did not inhibit hair cell death in <b>utricles</b> exposed to high-dose neomycin. The CEP- 11004 -induced protective effect was not due to inhibition of PKC or p 38, since neither chelerythrine nor SB 203580 could mimic the protective effect of CEP- 11004. In addition, inhibition of JNK inhibited the activation of caspase- 9 in hair cells. These results indicate that JNK {{plays an important role in}} neomycin-induced vestibular hair cell death and caspase- 9 activation...|$|R

We examined hair cell regeneration in post-hatch chick <b>utricles</b> that were cultured in media {{with or without the}} ototoxin, streptomycin, for various periods. The goal of our study was to characterize the dose- and time-dependent effects of streptomycin on hair cell loss and regeneration in vitro. <b>Utricles</b> that were cultured with streptomycin for 1 day displayed a dose-dependent loss of hair cells in spatial patterns and levels that were consistent with those observed in comparable experimental paradigms in vivo. Incorporation of the nucleotide analog bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) demonstrated that supporting cell proliferation is decreased during the first day of culture in the presence of streptomycin, but it increases over time when cultures are subsequently placed in streptomycin-free media. <b>Utricles</b> cultured for 1 day with streptomycin followed by 2 – 4 more days without streptomycin had numerous bundles of immature stereocilia, suggesting that new hair cells were generated in vitro. We tested this hypothesis by culturing <b>utricles</b> with BrdU for 3 or 5 days and double-labeling them to detect BrdU and the hair cell-specific antigen, TuJ 1.

500|$|The ear is {{the organ}} of hearing and, in mammals, balance. In mammals, the ear is usually {{described}} as having three parts—the outer ear, middle ear and the inner ear.

The middle ear includes the tympanic cavity and the three ossicles. The inner ear sits in the bony labyrinth, and contains structures which are key to several senses: the semicircular canals, which enable balance and eye tracking when moving; the <b>utricle</b> and saccule, which enable balance when stationary; and the cochlea, which enables hearing.
