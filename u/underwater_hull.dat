25|$|Klakring was {{scheduled}} to participate in Caribbean Law Enforcement Operations in November, but a post overhaul hull inspection brought about a change in plans. After careful examination of videos of an <b>underwater</b> <b>hull</b> inspect:ion, {{it was determined that}} the ship's hull would have to be repainted. Klakring was dry-docked from 7–21 November at the Charleston Naval Shipyard to undergo the necessary repairs. The ship successfully received full aviation certification on 27 November, and began final preparations for a Harpoon Missile Tactical Qualification.|$|E
50|$|For {{water systems}} at {{relatively}} low temperatures, the applied biocides may {{be classified as}} follows: inorganic chlorine and bromide compounds, chlorine and bromide cleavers, ozone and oxygen cleavers, unoxidizable biocides. One {{of the most important}} unoxidizable biocides is a mixture of chloromethyl-isothiazolinone and methyl-isothiazolinone. Also applied are dibrom nitrilopropionamide and quaternary ammonium compounds. For <b>underwater</b> ship <b>hulls</b> bottom paints are applied.|$|R
40|$|Minimum power {{requirement}} {{is one of}} the important design criteria for successful operation of underwater vehicles. CFD based prediction and estimation of {{power requirement}} is increasingly carried out in practice. However, reliable prediction depends on suitable turbulence models. This paper presents a comparative assessment of four low Reynolds number (low-Re) k- ε models for computation of hydrodynamic forces on <b>underwater</b> vehicle <b>hull</b> forms. The low-Re models are being considered more suitable for underwater axisymmetric bodies due to the following merits (i) they have no wall function approximations, (ii) they could compute low turbulence levels such as in the viscous sub-layer and (iii) they could account for the effect of damped turbulence. The low-Re models {{used in the present study}} are namely the models of Abe-Kondoh-Nagano (k- ε AKN), Chang-Hsieh-Chen (k- ε CHC), Launder-Sharma (k- ε LS), and Yang-Shih (k- ε YS). It has been found that the k- ε AKN low-Re model consistently provided superior performance in predicting the flow characteristics around <b>underwater</b> vehicle <b>hull</b> forms...|$|R
50|$|The {{vessel was}} {{designed}} by LOMOcean Design (formerly Craig Loomes Design Group Ltd.) and built by Calibre Boats in Auckland, New Zealand. The wave-piercing trimaran design allowed for improved speed and stability.

500|$|Texas {{entered the}} yard's {{floating}} drydock at approximately 22:30 on 13 December, at high tide with only [...] to spare between her hull and the blocks {{she would sit}} on. She underwent a 14-month refit that sought to restore the ship to her 1945 condition. While under refit, yard workers sand-blasted paint from not only the hull but also the superstructure and replaced many tons of rusted metal from the hull. Inside the ship, welders and fabricators replaced weakened structural beams and numerous rusted-out deck plates. Topside, workers removed the concrete from the main deck and made repairs. (A new pinewood deck would be installed in Green's Bayou.) In total, more than [...] of steel (amounting to about 15% of the ship's hull) was replaced and more than 40,000 rivets were seal-welded on the <b>underwater</b> <b>hull.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On 17 January, the PC-1264 {{unloaded}} her ammunition, {{then proceeded}} to the Luders Marine Construction Company in Stamford, Connecticut to have her bottom cleaned and receive a new coat of paint on her <b>underwater</b> <b>hull.</b> She arrived on 18 January and was in drydock for three days. For the next three months, the PC-1264 [...] patrolled a line running north by east for twenty miles from Buoy [...] "Able," [...] the farthest seaward buoy marking the mine-swept channel into New York, 45 miles away. Despite the monotony and the winter weather, the duty was pleasant, as the PC-1264 spent seven days at sea and then five days in port.|$|E
2500|$|On 18 February, {{the ship}} entered Dry Dock Number 4 at Pearl Harbor for repair to the ship's shafting, running gear, propellers, {{painting}} of the <b>underwater</b> <b>hull,</b> replacement of the bow sonar dome and its internal elements, and repairs to damaged tanks and superstructure cracks. [...] The Navy estimated that repairs would cost between $25 and $40 million and would be completed by September 2009. [...] The Honolulu Advertiser reported that a shipyard worker had said that no work {{had been done to}} repair the warship as of 12 April 2009.

40|$|Abstract—Navigating an {{unexplored}} environment using simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) {{requires that}} the robot’s trajectory include revisit actions {{in order to produce}} loop-closure constraints; however, efficient area coverage {{requires that the}} robot’s trajectory be minimally redundant in its path. This paper reports on a next-best-view SLAM algorithm that balances the trade-off between exploration and revisiting actions in order to simultaneously achieve efficient target area coverage and bounded-error navigation performance. Since area coverage efficiency and bounded localization performance represent competing objectives, the proposed algorithm computes the nextbest control action required for localization and area coverage performance. The proposed algorithm, called perception-driven navigation (PDN), represents an integrated navigation solution to the robotic area coverage problem whereupon visual SLAM perception uncertainty is explicitly accounted for. Results are shown for simulated monocular visual SLAM trajectories representative of the type of area coverage problem encountered in autonomous <b>underwater</b> ship <b>hull</b> inspection.

This would not have {{happened}} but for the declarations of war from France (1778), Spain (1779) and the Netherlands (1780): Britain had to face its three greatest rivals, and coppering allowed the navy to stay at sea for much longer without the need for cleaning and repairs to the <b>underwater</b> <b>hull,</b> making it a very attractive, if expensive, proposition.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{reports on}} a 3 D photomosaicing {{pipeline}} using data collected from an autonomous underwa-ter vehicle performing simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). The pipeline projects and blends 2 D imaging sonar data onto a large-scale 3 D mesh that is either given a priori or derived from SLAM. Compared to other methods that generate a 2 D-only mosaic, our approach produces 3 D models that are more structurally representative of the environment being surveyed. Additionally, our system leverages recent work in underwater SLAM using sparse point clouds derived from Doppler velocity log range returns to relax {{the need for a}} prior model. We show that the method produces reasonably accurate surface reconstruction and blending consistency, with and without the use of a prior mesh. We experimentally evaluate our approach with a Hovering Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (HAUV) performing inspection of a large <b>underwater</b> ship <b>hull.</b> I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{reports on}} a {{real-time}} monocular visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm and results for its application {{in the area of}} autonomous <b>underwater</b> ship <b>hull</b> inspection. The proposed algorithm overcomes some of the specific challenges associated with underwater visual SLAM, namely limited field of view imagery and feature-poor regions. It does so by exploiting our SLAM navigation prior within the image registration pipeline and by being selective about which imagery is considered informative in terms of our visual SLAM map. A novel online bag-of-words measure for intra-and inter-image saliency are introduced, and are shown to be useful for image key-frame selection, information-gain based link hypothesis, and novelty detection. Results from three real-world hull inspection experiments evaluate the overall approach— including one survey comprising a 3. 4 hour / 2. 7 km long trajectory. Index Terms—SLAM, computer vision, marine robotics, visual saliency, information gain. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{reports on}} an {{integrated}} navigation algorithm {{for the visual}} simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) robotic area coverage problem. In the robotic area coverage problem, {{the goal is to}} explore and map a given target area in a reasonable amount of time. This goal necessitates the use of minimally redundant overlap trajectories for coverage efficiency; however, visual SLAM’s navigation estimate will inevitably drift over time in the absence of loop-closures. Therefore, efficient area coverage and good SLAM navigation performance represent competing objectives. To solve this decision-making problem, we introduce perception-driven navigation (PDN), an integrated navigation algorithm that automatically balances between exploration and revisitation using a reward framework. This framework accounts for vehicle localization uncertainty, area coverage performance, and the identification of good candidate regions in the environment for loop-closure. Results are shown for a hybrid simulation using synthetic and real imagery from an autonomous <b>underwater</b> ship <b>hull</b> inspection application. I...|$|R
