The incident and its aftermath have been dramatized in several fictional and non-fiction accounts.|$|E

5|$|The term {{ambulance}} does, however, {{extend to}} {{a wider range of}} vehicles other than those with flashing warning lights and sirens. The term also includes a large number of non-urgent ambulances which are for transport of patients without an urgent acute condition (see below: Functional types) and a wide range of <b>urgent</b> <b>and</b> non-urgent vehicles including trucks, vans, bicycles, motorbikes, station wagons, buses, helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft, boats, and even hospital ships (see below: Vehicle types).|$|E
5|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} in {{the emergency}} setting can be difficult with the fiberoptic bronchoscope due to blood, vomit, or secretions in the airway and poor patient cooperation. Because of this, patients with massive facial injury, complete upper airway obstruction, severely diminished ventilation, or profuse upper airway bleeding are poor candidates for fiberoptic intubation. Fiberoptic intubation under general anesthesia typically requires two skilled individuals. Success rates of only 83–87% have been reported using fiberoptic techniques {{in the emergency}} department, with significant nasal bleeding occurring in up to 22% of patients. These drawbacks limit the use of fiberoptic bronchoscopy somewhat in <b>urgent</b> <b>and</b> emergency situations.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Great Depression, Silverman's travels {{expanded}} in the 1930s, {{when she began}} spending 6 months each year outside the U.S. As early as 1932, land purchase programs to buy and settle refugees on permanent homes in Palestine were being pursued by Jewish organizations. Silverman not only supported the plans and raised funds for them, but she planted the first tree in the colony at Wady Havarith. With Hitler's rise to power, Silverman's pleas for {{a safe haven for}} Jews became more <b>urgent</b> <b>and</b> her first-hand reports from Germany, Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Lithuania, and Poland contained explicit accounts of conditions. In 1938, Silverman was working with the Youth Aliyah Movement in conjunction with Hadassah in the U.S. to relocate 10,000 refugee children to Palestine. As a fund-raiser, Silverman's goal was to raise {{a quarter of a million}} dollars for resettlement and youth training in agricultural and vocational pursuits. In 1939, she ended her Polish tour studying the conditions and desperation, shortly before the Polish invasion, but the effort was successful in relocating some 7,000 young people from Poland, Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Romania to Palestine before the end of 1940.|$|E

5|$|No.79 Squadron {{was formed}} at RAAF Station Laverton in Victoria on 26April 1943 {{under the command}} of flying ace Squadron Leader Alan Rawlinson. The squadron's {{intended}} role was to use Spitfire Vc fighters to provide 'high cover' escort for the RAAF's P-40 Kittyhawk-equipped units which were engaging Japanese forces in the New Guinea Campaign. This requirement was considered <b>urgent,</b> <b>and</b> the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal George Jones, directed that No.79 Squadron receive priority for the RAAF's limited stock of Spitfires. The squadron moved to Wooloomanata Aerodrome several days after it was formed, and received its first Spitfires on 3May. While at Wooloomanata No.79 Squadron undertook training exercises to prepare for combat. The allocation of 24 Spitfires to the squadron led to No. 1 Wing RAAF, which was stationed near Darwin and responsible for protecting the town against air attack, to suffer a shortage of these aircraft during June and July.|$|E
5|$|The game is set after {{a fictional}} World War III, {{the events of}} which have killed off much of the population; those left alive are forced to fight for survival. Some of the {{survivors}} have formed gangs, some turned into mutants from the war's radiation, and some joined an evil militia; collectively, these groups are known as Wastelanders. Raiding different towns and villages, the Wastelanders sought to prey on the townspeople by stealing supplies, forcing some into slavery, and killing others. The heroine of the story, Angel, travels {{from town to town}} in search of her lost friend, Ekx, while helping the town's survivors fend off attacks from Wastelanders. Cruising in her armored car, Gypsy, she makes use of the car's mounted machine guns to defend the towns from thieves and slavers. The first lead Angel finds on her lost friend is from the city of Core, where Ekx was seen traveling through the city on his way to Coalhaven. Angel reaches Coalhaven and uses her armored car to defend the city from members of the renegade militia. After repelling the enemy, the townspeople re-establish their wireless communications and contact the nearby city of New Dallas. Recognizing the voice on the other end, the receiving operator in New Dallas turns out to be Angel's lost friend, Ekx. Ekx confides in Angel that he needs her for something <b>urgent</b> <b>and</b> that she must join him in New Dallas.|$|E

40|$|<b>Urgent</b> care <b>and</b> retail care {{clinics are}} a {{developing}} model {{of health care}} providers that focuses on immediate walk-in care. This paper explores the influence that hospitals, demographic, and socioeconomic factors have on the placement of these clinics. This study employs a comparative quantitative design to explore the association of these variables with the placement of <b>urgent</b> care <b>and</b> retail clinics in Mississippi’s Public Health Districts I and II, which comprise the northernmost twenty counties in the state. The findings show that a high population size, high median household income, low percent of families in poverty, and a low uninsured rate in the counties were strong indicators of whether a retail or urgent care clinic would be present in a county. The findings also showed {{that there was a}} weak association between the presence of hospitals and the presence of <b>urgent</b> care <b>and</b> retail care clinics. This study demonstrates that <b>urgent</b> care <b>and</b> retail clinics are generally not serving the most rural and poor counties...|$|R

25|$|After the Second World War, {{it became}} clearer to the British {{government}} that its African colonies were moving towards self-government {{at a faster}} pace than previously envisaged, so the condition of African residents on the estates {{could no longer be}} ignored. African political consciousness was growing and unused and under-used estate land could no longer be justified by an appeal to dubious 19th century claims. The increasing disturbances made resolution more <b>urgent,</b> <b>and</b> a commission of enquiry was set up.|$|E

25|$|If {{effective}} protection {{were implemented}} immediately and bongo populations allowed to expand without transfers, then this {{would create a}} bigger population of genetically impoverished bongos. These animals would be less able {{to adapt to a}} dynamic environment. Whilst the population remains small, the impact of transfers will be greater. For this reason, the 'metapopulation management plan' must occur concurrently with conservation strategies to enhance in situ population growth. This initiative is both <b>urgent</b> <b>and</b> fundamental to the future survival of the mountain bongo in the wild.|$|E
