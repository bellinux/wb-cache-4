It addresses the operational issues as well as measures for tightening the regulatory framework,especially relating to commercial communication from subscribers indulging in telemarketing activities, intentionally disguising themselves without registering as telemarketer with TRAI. The subscribers indulge in the activities like these without making payment of promotional SMS charge or the other kind of charges or deposits which should be paid by the registered telemarketers. These subscribers also circumvent the procedures for telemarketing followed by registered telemarketers. The subscribers like these indulge in sending <b>unsolicited</b> commercial <b>communications</b> to the customers who are even registered in National Customer Preference Register (NCPR).|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Sender Scorecards are {{conceived}} as a method to enable different IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) domains and networks to exchange trustworthy information on sender identities and other relevant information, to allow discrimination between legitimate and unsolicited IMS communication. The approach uses a secure and interoperable scorecard about the sender of IMS calls. Such a scorecard is generated, transported, and evaluated collaboratively between different network domains. Scorecards are used to generate a standardized exchange format for sender and message related information. Depending {{on the outcome of}} the scorecard evaluation, the receiving domain can take appropriate actions such as denying or allowing a communication attempt. The present paper proposes a blueprint for an IMS architecture including scorecard elements, based on 3 GPP standards. In this context, procedures operating with scorecards for prevention of <b>unsolicited</b> <b>communications</b> are presented. I...|$|E
40|$|The sending of <b>unsolicited</b> <b>communications</b> (commonly {{known as}} ‘spam’) is {{considered}} as a great intrusion into {{the privacy of the}} user of electronic communications services, and is therefore regulated in Article 13 of the ePrivacy directive. At the time of the adoption of the directive, the most common ways of spamming were via telephone, fax, electronic mail and SMS. Technological progress, however, has since created more types of spamming, one of which is Bluespam, i. e. the action of sending spam to Bluetooth-enabled devices, such as mobile phones, PDAs or laptop computers. Although, at first sight, it would seem that Bluespam should be {{considered as a}}ny other type of spam, and would therefore fall under the ambit of Article 13 of the ePrivacy directive, a closer look reveals that the answer is in fact not so obvious. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The ACMA’s {{overriding}} {{purpose is}} to make communications and media work in the public interest, and its international engagement is central to achieving this. The role of international engagement in both protecting and promoting Australia’s communications and media interests {{is reflected in the}} legislation the ACMA administers - particularly for spectrum management, telecommunications and radiocommunications standards-setting, <b>unsolicited</b> <b>communications</b> and cybersecurity, and online content. These areas of the ACMA’s work span jurisdictional boundaries, often making it necessary to engage with international bodies and overseas regulators to develop effective responses to the challenges they raise. The ACMA and its predecessors have been engaging with overseas organisations and in international fora for many years. However, the continued global integration of communications and media markets and services, and the disruptive impacts of digital technologies is driving the need for greater collaboration and cooperation between countries. The ACMA is one of many communications and media regulators around the world looking to maximise the social and economic benefits of digital technologies through developing best-practice responses to these challenges. International engagement is an important way the ACMA advances policies and programs that will help to reduce harms and promote outcomes in the interests of Australian business and the community. For example, the ACMA’s international engagement aims to prevent cybersecurity threats and <b>unsolicited</b> <b>communications</b> at the source country through entering bilateral and multilateral arrangements to support a safer networked environment. And, along with other international regulators, the ACMA is looking to ensure that sufficient spectrum is available to cater for the expected growth in mobile broadband services through regional and global harmonisation to foster innovation and productivity within the Australian communications sector. Through engaging with overseas regulators and other international bodies, the ACMA can learn from their experiences and enhance its own regulatory practice. In so doing, the ACMA ensures its decisions and approaches reflect world’s best practice, and as an organisation it is well positioned to respond to the pressures and demands of the evolving environment in which it operates...|$|E

Such unwanted and <b>unsolicited</b> <b>communications</b> are responsible for a significant loss of time and money for all corporations and may be damaging for corporate reputations. We present here the email delivery solution we have implemented in our institute, to prevent users from receiving spam and viruses. Our choice was motivated by many criteria including reliability, availability and security but also flexibility and price. Indeed, this email gateway runs on a Linux server and is based on a few modular open source tools designed for security purposes. We present all the tools involved in this gateway and discuss their advantages and drawbacks. Technical explanations of system optimization and Bayesian filtering are also demonstrated in this paper. Finally, we show the rate of success we obtained on deploying this email gateway...|$|E

40|$|Email is a {{pervasive}} {{means of communication}} on the Internet. Email exchanges between individuals {{can be seen as}} social interactions between email sender(s) and receiver(s), thus can be represented as a network. Networks of human interactions such as friendship relations, research collaborations, and phone calls have been widely studied before to allow understanding of the characteristics, as well as the structure and dynamics of such social interactions. In this thesis, we look into the social network properties of email networks generated from real traffic, and investigate how a vast amount of unsolicited email traffic (spam) affect these properties. Current advances in Internet data collection and processing has facilitated the study of the characteristics of email traffic observed on the Internet. In our study, we have collected large-scale email datasets from traffic traversing a high-speed Internet backbone link and have generated email networks from the observed communications to analyze the structure and dynamics of these social interactions. Moreover, we aim at unveiling the distinguishing characteristics of legitimate and <b>unsolicited</b> email <b>communications.</b> We show that the networks of legitimate email traffic has the same structural and temporal properties that other social networks exhibit, and therefore can be modeled as small-world scale-free networks. However, the <b>unsolicited</b> email <b>communications</b> cause deviations and anomalies in the structure of email networks, and this deviation from the expected social structural properties can be used to find the sources of spam email. We also show that email networks, similar to other social networks, have a community structure which can be found using different community detection algorithms. However, not all community detection algorithms can identify structural communities that coincide with the true logical communities of email networks, i. e., distinct communities of legitimate and unsolicited email. Our study shows that a link-based community detection algorithm is more suitable for this purpose than more widely used node-based algorithms. The possibility of merely using the social structure of email traffic to identify the source of spam and separate the unsolicited email from legitimate email, can potentially be used to improve the protection against spam and other types of malicious activities on the Internet...|$|R
40|$|Privacy {{has been}} {{identified}} by many studies as the main problem why customers are not completing their online transactions. They fear to provide sensitive information such as personal and financial details. It {{is not surprising that}} most websites nowadays include privacy statements in their websites to encourage customers to complete their transactions. However, only few customers can find this information easily on merchants ’ websites rendering the use of this information obsolete. The aim of this paper is two folds. First it identifies the link or document dealing with private policies on the website for the customer to consult. However, as the current research shows, these documents are long, tedious to read and contain information that may not be relevant to customers. The second aim {{of this paper is to}} automatically extract the most relevant information to the customer in the form of short statement. These statements include information on sharing and selling of personal details, the use of secure technologies, customer satisfaction with the goods purchased, the use of cookies and <b>unsolicited</b> <b>communications.</b> We use the Semantic distance similarity model as the basis to develop the information extraction component...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Undesired mail, such as commercials, {{is called}} spam in mail services. Spit is what spam is for mail services, <b>unsolicited</b> <b>communications.</b> The {{difference}} in spit and spam is that spam can be checked before the delivery to the recipient and spit can be reliably detected {{only after the}} call is made. Voice over IP (VoIP) community has adopted a more peer-to-peer approach, in which the registrars and proxies are located on the participating nodes, rather than on separate servers. Industry has also been quite keen {{in the development of}} such approach, especially ones that use identifier-locator split protocols. The lack of centralized authorities and the usage of long trust paths make detecting spit even harder a task. In this paper we describe a system to disseminate information of friendships that are based on an end-host based identifier-locator split protocol. In our solution the existing buddy lists are used to introduce one-hop connections in the system. In our system we rather detect friends than spit or spitters. Moreover, our solution can be generalized for situations where the before-hand inspection of the content is impossible or otherwise hard to implement. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Unsolicited</b> <b>communications</b> {{currently}} {{accounts for}} over {{sixty percent of}} all sent e-mail with projections reaching the mid-eighties. While much spam is innocuous, a portion is engineered by criminals to prey upon, or scam, unsuspecting people. The senders of scam spam attempt to mask their messages as nonspam and con through a range of tactics, including pyramid schemes, securities fraud, and identity theft via phisher mechanisms (e. g. faux PayPal or AOL websites). To lessen the suspicion of fraudulent activities, scam messages sent by the same individual, or collaborating group, augment the text of their messages and assume an endless number of pseudonyms with {{an equal number of}} different stories. In this paper, we introduce ScamSlam, a software system designed to learn the underlying number criminal cells perpetrating a particular type of scam, as well as to identify which scam spam messages were written by which cell. The system consists of two main components; 1) a filtering mechanism based on a Poisson classifier to separate scam from general spam and non-spam messages, and 2) a message normalization and clustering technique to relate scam messages to one another. We apply ScamSlam to a corpus of approximately 500 scam messages communicating the “Nigerian ” advance fee fraud. The scam filtration method filters out greater than 99 % of scam messages, which vastly outperforms well known spam filtering software whic...|$|E
40|$|Purpose- The {{purpose of}} this paper is to report on {{research}} investigating the outcomes associated with a network for learning that was developed from a student based project involving the application and management of social media for business. Design/methodology/approach- Questionnaires were used to gather responses from tourism, leisure and event-related regional business owners/managers who participated in a student based project from 2010 - 2012. <b>Unsolicited</b> feedback and <b>communications,</b> secondary sources, observations and communications were used to validate responses. Pre- and post-project social media usage and usage barriers; knowledge and skill gained and/or shared and with whom TLErelated businesses shared the information gained; and an examination of the network for learning. Findings: A dynamic, network was developed to share and exchange information. Outcomes included: the strengthening of cooperative working relationships between regional tourism businesses and the host institution; increased awareness between stakeholders of new and innovative ideas in the tourism field; the acquisition of expertise by participating businesses in the use of social media; and the enhancement of tourism in the regional area. Results of this study show that increased levels of knowledge and skill were gained by participating businesses and then shared with non-participating businesses to enhance the capacity of TLE-related stakeholders in the regional area. This process amplified learning, knowledge creation and understanding and facilitation of collaborative networks for learning. Implications: This study furthers current knowledge on ways to create capacity within small tourism businesses by integrating social media within a student-based project that enhance participant skill and knowledge development...|$|R
40|$|We seek {{to redefine}} spam {{and the role}} of the spam filter in the context of Social Networking Services (SNS). SNS, such as MySpace and Facebook, are {{increasing}} in popularity. They enable and encourage users to communicate with previously unknown network members on an unprecedented scale. The problem we address with our work is that users of these sites risk being overwhelmed with <b>unsolicited</b> <b>communications</b> not just from e-mail spammers, but also from a large pool of well intending, yet subjectively uninteresting people. Those who wish to remain open to meeting new people must spend a large amount of time estimating deception and utility in unknown contacts. Our goal is to assist the user in making these determinations. This requires identifying clear cases of undesirable spam and helping them to assess the more ambiguous ones. Our approach is to present an analysis of the salient features of the sender’s profile and network that contains otherwise hard to perceive cues about their likely intentions. As with traditional spam analysis, much of our work focuses on detecting deception: finding profiles that mimic ordinary users but which are actually commercial and usually undesirable entities. We address this within the larger context of making more legible the key cues presented by any unknown contact. We have developed a research prototype that categorizes senders into broader categories than spam/not spam using features unique to SNS. We discuss our initial experiment, and its results and implications. 1...|$|E
