40|$|A pair of <b>hypoid</b> <b>gears</b> {{refers to}} a pinion and a gear with skew axes. <b>Hypoid</b> <b>gears</b> are crucial to some power {{transmission}} systems, {{such as those of}} helicopters, power generation machines and automobiles. However, the design and manufacturing of <b>hypoid</b> <b>gears</b> are quite difficult. Currently, the major parameters of <b>hypoid</b> <b>gears</b> are calculated, but the geometries of the gears are not fully defined. To machine a <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear,</b> parameters of cutting systems are determined according to the gear design, whereas, settings of CNC machine tools with the machining parameters are also computed. The existing <b>hypoid</b> <b>gears</b> machining methods use the simplified blade model of the cutting systems, resulting in large errors in the machined gears. This new work proposes an accurate approach, to determine the parameters of the cutting system blades, for the face-milling of <b>hypoid</b> <b>gears.</b> In this work, a parametric model of the blades is established; and according to the <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear</b> parameters, the pressure angle and the cutting system radius are precisely calculated. Currently, <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear</b> engineers can use special CAD/CAM software to design the gears and to calculate machine settings. Unfortunately, these software are developed only for particular machine tools; it cannot be used for <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear</b> machine tools of different configurations. Moreover, few technical articles has been published to clearly address challenges in the CNC programming and post-processing for the multi-axis face-milling of <b>hypoid</b> <b>gears,</b> such as the parameters determination of a cutter system, its location and orientation calculation and CNC programs generation. To solve the current problems, another part of this research proposes a generic approach to CNC programming and post-processing for gear face-milling. The main contributions of this part includes (1) a new mathematical model to calculate the cutter system location and orientation and (2) a generic post-processing method to establish the machine kinematics chain and to compute the coordinates of the machine axes in face-milling. This approach provides a general and accurate methodology for the face-milling of <b>hypoid</b> <b>gears</b> on any machine tools and can be directly applied to the <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear</b> manufacturing for better quality...|$|R

Study on mechanisms of vibration and noise of the <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear</b> pair, and investigating on reducing its vibration and noise are of great significance. Firstly, a simplified dynamic model of the <b>hypoid</b> <b>gears</b> of main reducer, with considering the time-varying teeth stiffness and teeth surface friction damping, was established.

40|$|In general, {{the shaft}} angle of {{automotive}} <b>hypoid</b> <b>gears</b> is 90 degrees. Therefore, the design method of an angular <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear</b> {{had not been}} investigated sufficiently up to now. Moreover, the tooth spiral of the <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear</b> is generally on the right hand and the pinion axis is offset below the gear axis. Therefore, when the pinion axis is offset conversely, the design method has not been investigated in detail.

The pitch surfaces appear conical but, {{to compensate for the}} offset shaft, are in fact hyperboloids of revolution. <b>Hypoid</b> <b>gears</b> are almost always designed to operate with shafts at 90 degrees. Depending on which side the shaft is offset to, relative to the angling of the teeth, contact between <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear</b> teeth may be even smoother and more gradual than with spiral bevel gear teeth, but also have a sliding action along the meshing teeth as it rotates and therefore usually require some of the most viscous types of gear oil to avoid it being extruded from the mating tooth faces, the oil is normally designated HP (for hypoid) followed by a number denoting the viscosity. Also, the pinion can be designed with fewer teeth than a spiral bevel pinion, with the result that gear ratios of 60:1 and higher are feasible using a single set of <b>hypoid</b> <b>gears.</b> This style of gear is most common in motor vehicle drive trains, in concert with a differential. Whereas a regular (nonhypoid) ring-and-pinion gear set is suitable for many applications, it is not ideal for vehicle drive trains because it generates more noise and vibration than a hypoid does.

This conference paper {{was presented at the}} 7 th International Styrian Noise, Vibration & Harshness Congress, Graz, Austria, 2013. [URL] paper presents an investigation into Elastohydrodynamic (EHL) modeling of differential <b>hypoid</b> <b>gears</b> {{that can be used in}} coupling with Newtonian (or multibody) dynamics to study Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH) phenomena, such as axle whine. The latter is a noise of a tonal nature, emitted from differential axles, characterised by the gear meshing frequency and its multiples. It appears at a variety of operating conditions; during drive and coasting, high and low torque loading. Key design targets for differential <b>hypoid</b> <b>gears</b> are improved efficiency and reduced vibration, which depend critically on the formation of an EHL lubricant film. The stiffness and damping of the oil film and friction generated in the contact can have important effects and cannot be neglected when examining the NVH behaviour of <b>hypoid</b> <b>gears.</b> The operating conditions in <b>hypoid</b> <b>gears</b> are usually characterized by high load, relatively low speeds, angled flow and elliptical contact footprint of high aspect ratio. Some extrapolated/empirical equations to estimate friction and film thickness have been reported for moderate loads. However, their use in <b>hypoid</b> <b>gears</b> is questionable. Additionally, the majority of reported numerical models for film thickness and friction have not been applied under such operating conditions. In this paper a numerical model of EHL elliptical point contact has been presented to obtain the EHL film behaviour under the usual range of operating conditions of <b>hypoid</b> <b>gears.</b> Realistic engine torque-speed characteristics are used. For these conditions, the load share per teeth pair contact is in the region of 500 - 6000 N. A suitable method of solution is applied to ease the convergence of the numerical method, namely the distributed line low relaxation effective influence Newton-Raphson method. As the result of the angled direction of the entraining flow in the contact of <b>hypoid</b> <b>gear</b> teeth pairs, this method has been found to be suitable, thus adopted. The geometric and kinematic input data for EHL calculations are calculated using Tooth Contact Analysis (TCA) ...|$|R
