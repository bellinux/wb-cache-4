These type of secondary transactions have become increasingly explored since mid-2008 and throughout 2009 as many sellers did not want to take a loss through a straight sale of their portfolio at a steep discount but instead were ready to abandon some of the future upside in exchange for a bridge of the <b>uncalled</b> <b>capital</b> commitments.|$|E
50|$|After {{spending}} {{eighteen months}} in Hollywood studying the filmmaking process, Charles Chauvel returned to Queensland and formed his own production company, Australian Film Productions Ltd. He helped to secure funding by lobbying the Ipswich and Toowoomba Chambers of Commerce on {{the necessity of}} an Australian film industry. The company was formed by issuing 30,000 shares at ₤1 each. Chauvel announced his goal in 1924:It is our intention to produce films in Queensland and wherever possible to use Queensland talent in all departments of our work. Queensland, with its excellent climate conditions, its months of fine weather, and its beautiful and varied scenery is undoubtedly {{one of the best}} parts of Australia in which to produce motion pictures... We intend to film our stories with faithful regard to thc spirit and traditions of our young nation, and we will present the same with the belief that there will be audience response for home-made productions which are offered through the joint effortsof Australian writers, craftsmen, and artists.In the end the paid-up capital of the company was £7,000, and the <b>uncalled</b> <b>capital</b> was £4,240.|$|E
50|$|The auditor {{said the}} company’s {{continuation}} {{depended on the}} bank’s continued facilities. Banco Exterior SA took a secured debenture on 18 October 1983 on all property and assets, present and future, including good will, book debts and <b>uncalled</b> <b>capital</b> (but fixed assets were only £5000). They also took a personal guarantee from David for £30K. The draft accounts for 1984-6 were produced by auditors six months late in January 1987. They showed a £55K loss and £29K loss, with liabilities over assets reaching £175K. Auditors warned of insolvent trading, if the bank did not give more credit. The bank did oblige in March, but less than before. The overdraft decreased, but debt to its most important Cypriot shipper increased to £175K. The company was put in creditors’ voluntary liquidation on 2 October 1987, with debts of £317,694, half owed to one Cypriot shipping firm, as a trade creditor that brought them fruit. In 1988 the liquidator asked David and Murphy why there was trading while insolvent. David replied that they knew liquidation was inevitable in February with the accounts, and trading was continued because there was perishable fruit in cold store. The liquidator sought them to contribute £107,946 each, plus costs the court saw fit. The liquidator argued that the right measure to contribute was the reduction in net assets caused by the wrongful trading.|$|E
5000|$|The Yorkshire Woolcombers Association Ltd had {{borrowed}} money from various guarantors, {{and in a}} trust deed of 23 April 1900, it said it was giving a floating charge to the guarantors to secure the money. Further guarantees {{were given to the}} guarantor's bank, the Bradford District Bank Ltd, and the guarantors were pressing for repayment. With debts still outstanding, the Association organised a further deal on 25 October 1902. Mr Frederick Illingworth, on behalf of the guarantors, agreed with the Association to have a charge over the company's book debts. It called this an [...] "indemnity and specific security", and said that being assigned were “all and singular the book and other debts now owing to the association, and also all and singular the book and other debts which may {{at any time during the}} continuance of this security become owing to the association (but not including <b>uncalled</b> <b>capital</b> of the association), and the full benefit of all the securities for the said present and future book and other debts”. On 21 November 1902, Mr Illingworth appointed a receiver to call in the book debts (a large sum, amounting to £71,000). Receivers of the other creditors were quickly appointed on 25 November, and contended that the deed from 25 October 1902 was void, because it was not registered, as floating charges were meant to be, under the Companies Act 1900 section 14(1) (now Companies Act 2006, section 860).|$|E

40|$|During the British Railway Mania of the 1840 s the {{promotion}} {{and construction of}} new railways increased dramatically. These new projects were generally financed by shares with <b>uncalled</b> <b>capital,</b> which allowed investors to make payments on an instalment basis {{over a period of}} several years. There is evidence that these assets can be regarded as futures or options, implying that investors were purchasing highly leveraged derivatives. The leverage embedded in these assets multiplied both the positive returns during the boom, and the negative returns during the downturn. It also affected the payment schedule for investors as little capital was required initially, but the subsequent ‘calls for capital’ resulted in deleveraging. ...|$|E
40|$|The seminal work of J. B. Jefferys {{highlighted}} two unusual {{features of}} the Victorian equity market, namely high share denomination and <b>uncalled</b> <b>capital.</b> This article examines {{the extent to which}} publicly traded company stocks in the nineteenth century had these features. It also analyses the effect of these features on stock returns using monthly data for the London Stock Market over the period 1825 - 70. We find that stocks with unpaid capital earned a higher return, which is consistent with investors being rewarded for the risk of a call on their personal assets. We also find that stocks with a high share denomination earned a lower return, which is consistent with the view that this feature was conducive to superior corporate governance...|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The dataset contains monthly indices of returns for the British equity market covering the period 1825 - 70. The main data source used is the Course of the Exchange, a stockbroker list for the London Stock Exchange. All common equities from this list are included apart from some stocks {{for which there is}} insufficient or missing data and stocks which listed for less than 12 months. Using monthly stock prices from the Course of the Exchange, the team computed capital appreciation, dividend yield and total return for the overall market and for the thirteen industrial/commercial sectors on the market. These returns were computed using three weighting techniques - weighted by market capitalization, weighted by paid-up capital, and equally weighted (or unweighted). Monthly total market capitalization and paid-up capital is also reported for the overall market and for each of the thirteen sectors. In an attempt to control for survivorship bias, adjustments are made to the total returns using three different strategies. Using these strategies, the lower and upper bound estimates of shareholder returns are established. Main Topics : The stock indices currently available for the 1825 - 1870 period are based on a small sample of equity stocks. Indeed, the best index, that of Gayer at al, only covers the period up to 1850. The aim {{of this study was to}} construct a comprehensive dataset of British equity prices for the 1825 - 70 period, using share price data from The Course of the Exchange and The Railway Times. As well as estimating total market capitalisation for the period mentioned, this study also shows sectoral indices. These indices will enable researchers to address three important research questions. Firstly, it will be possible to measure the growth of the market for equity and analyse which sectors contributed to the growth. Secondly, using this data will make it possible to shed some light on the extent to which <b>uncalled</b> <b>capital</b> was used and to determine the riskiness and value of <b>uncalled</b> <b>capital.</b> Thirdly, this study provides the possibility to assess the impact of liberalisation of company law on the development on the equity market. <br...|$|E
