On the Oxford Canal it is called a Babbie; on the Grand Union Canal it {{is referred to as the}} cill Bumper. Some canal operation authorities, primarily in the United States and Canada, call the ledge a miter sill (mitre sill in Canada).|$|E
2500|$|Looking superficially {{similar to}} the caisson lock is the shaft lock.

[...] Notable examples have been built at Saint Denis (Paris, France), Horin (near Melnik, Czech Republic) and Anderten (Hannover Germany). The shaft lock at Minden [...] has a fall of [...] and has eight tanks linked in pairs to the lock chamber. [...] As the lock is emptied water is run into each chamber in turn, for filling the water is released from the chambers thus saving the waste of a complete lockfull of water. [...] An earlier attempt at a shaft lock had been made at Trollhättan in Sweden on the line of the present Göta canal. [...] The fall would have been , astonishing in 1749. [...] However the approach tunnel proved to be unusable in times of flood and the shaft lock was replaced by a 2-rise staircase in 1768.|$|E

2500|$|By March 1926, the Corps {{had begun}} calling the lake it had created Kingman Lake, after the well-regarded {{former head of}} the Corps, Brigadier General Dan Christie Kingman. The name was {{formally}} proposed in September. Improvements to the island and lake continued: The Corps spent $55,000 for a rock and concrete riprap wall around Kingman Lake, and another $20,000 for gates and conduits at the north and south ends of the lake to maintain a constant water level in lake. The Corps wanted to install a lock in {{the southern end of the}} lake to give pleasure boats access to it, and began laying plans for a second lake (East Lake) on the eastern side of the Anacostia River opposite Kingman Lake. That same year, the National Aeronautic Association proposed filling in all or part of Kingman Lake to build a new city airport. In early 1929, a channel [...] deep was dredged under Benning Bridge as it passed over Kingman Lake. [...] (As of 1998, due to the reconstruction of Benning Bridge and other changes, this had been replaced with a [...] wide culvert.) The dredging ship Benning also dredged about half of Kingman Lake to deepen it. By this time, the conduit and gates had been installed in the lake's lower exit, and the <b>upper</b> <b>gates</b> were expected to be installed soon. About [...] of the western shore of Kingman Lake between Gallinger Hospital and Benning Bridge were set aside for gardens in March 1933 to provide food for the needy.|$|E
60|$|As my {{boy could}} {{remember}} very few incidents of this voyage afterwards, I dare say {{he spent a}} great part of it with his face in a book, and was aware of the landscape only from time to time when he lifted his eyes from the story he was reading. That was apt to be the way with him; and before he left the Boy's Town the world within claimed him more and more. He ceased to be that eager comrade he had once been; sometimes he left his book with a sigh; and he saw much of the outer world through a veil of fancies quivering like an autumn haze between him and its realities, softening their harsh outlines, and giving them a fairy coloring. I think he would sometimes have been better employed in looking directly at them; but he had to live his own life, and I cannot live it over for him. The season was the one of all others best fitted to win him to the earth, and in a measure it did. It was spring, and along the tow-path strutted the large, glossy blackbirds which had just come back, and made the boys sick with longing to kill them, they offered such good shots. But the boys had no powder with them, and at any rate the captain would not have stopped his boat, which was rushing on at the rate of two miles an hour, to let them pick up a bird, if they had hit it. They were sufficiently provisioned without the game, however; the mother had baked bread, and boiled a ham, and provided sugar-cakes in recognition of the holiday character of the voyage, and they had the use of the boat cooking-stove for their tea and coffee. The boys had to content themselves with such sense of adventure as they could get out of going ashore when the boat was passing through the locks, or staying aboard and seeing the water burst and plunge in around the boat. They had often watched this thrilling sight at the First Lock, but it had a novel interest now. As their boat approached the lock, the lower gates were pushed open by men who set their breasts to the long sweeps or handles of the gates, and when the boat was fairly inside of the stone-walled lock they were closed behind her. Then the <b>upper</b> <b>gates,</b> which opened against the dull current, and were kept shut by its pressure, were opened a little, and the waters rushed and roared into the lock, and began to lift the boat. The gates were opened wider and wider, till the waters poured a heavy cataract into the lock, where the boat tossed on their increasing volume, and at last calmed themselves to the level within. Then the boat passed out through the <b>upper</b> <b>gates,</b> on even water, and the voyage to the next lock began. At first it was rather awful, and the little children were always afraid when they came to a lock, but the boys enjoyed it after the first time. They would have liked to take turns driving the pair of horses that drew the boat, but it seemed too bold a wish, and I think they never proposed it; they did not ask, either, to relieve the man at the helm.|$|E

5000|$|The first lock at Sandford was the {{navigation}} weir or flash lock {{situated on the}} old river channel {{at the site of}} the lasher today. This was described in 1624 as [...] "Great Lockes" [...] and was replaced in about 1632 by one of the first pound locks to be built in England. Iffley, Sandford and Culham locks were built by the Oxford-Burcot Commission following the Parliament Act of 1623. The old lock has since been filled in but its position can still be seen (the position of the <b>upper</b> <b>gates</b> can be seen in the stonework above the present <b>upper</b> <b>gates).</b> A new lock on the present site was opened in 1836 which lasted until the most recent improvements when the present lock was built in 1972.|$|E

25|$|Gates are the {{watertight}} doors which seal off the chamber {{from the upper}} and lower pounds. Each end of the chamber is equipped with a gate, or pair of half-gates, made of oak or elm (or now sometimes steel). The most common arrangement, usually called miter gates, was invented by Leonardo da Vinci, sometime around the late 15th century. When closed, a pair meet at an angle like a chevron pointing upstream and only a very small difference in water-level is necessary to squeeze the closed gates securely together. This reduces any leaks from between them and prevents their being opened until water levels have equalised. If the chamber is not full, the top gate is secure; and if the chamber is not completely empty, the bottom gate is secure (in normal operation, therefore, the chamber cannot be open at both ends). A lower gate is taller than an <b>upper</b> <b>gate,</b> because the <b>upper</b> <b>gate</b> only has to be tall enough to close off the upper pound, while the lower gate {{has to be able to}} seal off a full chamber. The <b>upper</b> <b>gate</b> is as tall as the canal is deep, plus a little more for the balance beam, winding mechanism, etc.; the lower gate's height equals the <b>upper</b> <b>gate</b> plus the lock's rise.|$|R
50|$|The land {{wall was}} 12 ft thick at its base, and 8 ft thick at the top. The river wall was 12 ft thick {{from top to}} bottom. The lower lock gates were 25 by 25 ft, and each weighed 15 ST. The <b>upper</b> <b>gates</b> {{measured}} 9 by 25 ft, and weighed 9 ST each.|$|E
50|$|There were no valves in the <b>upper</b> <b>gates.</b> The {{lock chamber}} was filled by {{culverts}} {{in the lock}} walls measuring 3 by 6 ft.

25|$|The 1828 design {{originally}} {{filled the}} lock chamber {{through the use}} of culverts in the lock masonry. The wicket, i.e. large paddle valve, hidden in the masonry recess where the <b>upper</b> <b>gate</b> fit in, would be opened, and water would flow through the lock masonry to three openings in the lock chamber. Both sides of the lock had these, so there would be a total of 2 wickets, and 6 openings. The <b>upper</b> <b>gate</b> is above the breast wall. Most of the wicket openings in the <b>upper</b> <b>gate</b> recess have been closed with masonry, but one wicket at Violettes Lock is still intact as of 2013 (see photo). Note that modern replacement gates in locks 1-23, have the wickets in the gates, since the original wickets in the lock masonry are inoperable. This system of routing water through the masonry was abandoned due the tendency for debris to clog the opening.|$|R

5000|$|There was a mill here {{built by}} the Knights Templar in around 1294. There are also records of a ferry and a fish weir in mediaeval times. In the reign of Edward III there is {{an account of the}} immemorial {{conflict}} between millers and bargemen when [...] "the men of Oxon broke down the locks of Sandford". This was probably at the navigation weir or flash lock on the old river channel behind the second island. This was described in 1624 as ‘Great Lockes’. It was replaced in 1631 when the Oxford-Burcot Commission built one of the first pound locks in England here. The lock was passed on to the Thames Navigation Commission in 1790 and lengthened in 1795, under the direction of Daniel Harris, the Oxford gaoler, at a cost of nearly £1,800. In 1836 a new lock was built on the current site alongside the old one and a lock house was ordered in 1839. The old lock has since been filled in after an incident when a miller opened the sluices and caused damage to the embankments. Its position is still visible (the position of the <b>upper</b> <b>gates</b> {{can be seen in the}} stonework above the present <b>upper</b> <b>gates).</b> An iron bridge above the lock was built between 1866 and 1877. The latest rebuild of the lock was in 1972.|$|E
50|$|With the {{exception}} of Detzem, all the structures at each change in level are laid out side by side; the lock is by one riverbank, the weir {{in the middle and}} the hydropower plant on the other bank. Between the lock and weir are a boat slipway/boat channel and boat lock, while between the weir and the power station is the fish ladder. The structures have been blended into the landscape through their low-level design; this was achieved by the choice of sector gates for the weir, vertically lowering <b>upper</b> <b>gates</b> and mitred lower lock gates. The water levels and hydropower works are controlled by the Fankel Central Control Station (Zentralwarte Fankel) of the RWE Power Company at Fankel.|$|E
