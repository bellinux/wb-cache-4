50|$|The {{sedimentary}} {{record in}} the area varies between volcaniclastic and siliciclastic deposition, the latter being present in the Longmnyd area and the former being representative of the Stanner-Hanter and Malvern Complex. Depositional facies include the Uriconian and the Longmyndian sequences. The {{relationship between the two}} is complex with some suggestion that the two are coeval and faulted as well as two <b>unconformable</b> <b>strata.</b> The former (coeval but different depositional facies) is supported by U-Pb Zircon dating from the Longmyndian bentonites. However, this is not definitive.|$|E

Our data are surface structures and 39 Ar- 40 Ar ages of volcanic products on Tromen volcano. Tromen is an active back-arc volcano in the Andean foothills of Neuquèn province, Argentina. Its volcanic products are <b>unconformable</b> upon Mesozoic <b>strata</b> of the Neuquèn basin. The volcano straddles a N-S trending pop-up, which formed during E-W shortening. The main underlying structures are eastward verging thrusts. Their traces curve around the eastern foot of the volcano. Minor folds and faults also occur in the volcanic cover of Tromen, {{as a result of}} E-W shortening. New 39 Ar- 40 Ar ages for these volcanic rocks are younger than 2. 27 ± 0. 10 Ma and show that Tromen has been active almost continuously from the late Pliocene to the Holocene. We conclude that volcanism and thrusting have been coeval and that magma must have reached the surface in a tectonic setting of horizontal compression. Our results have wider implications for magmatic processes in such settings...|$|R
