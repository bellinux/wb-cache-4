5|$|Even {{after the}} album had been completed, Collins was <b>unhappy</b> <b>about</b> leaving the drumkit to sing lead, {{and the band}} were unsure he would be {{comfortable}} as frontman on tour. The group decided to try anyway, and needed someone to drum while Collins was singing. Collins insisted on choosing the touring drummer himself, selecting Bill Bruford, who he had already worked with in Brand X. Collins continued to drum during instrumental sections.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy decided {{toward the}} end of 1871 to end his {{business}} partnership with Eddy. She had accused him in front of others of cheating at cards; it was one of several scenes she had caused between them and he walked out on her. There was a temporary reconciliation, but he was <b>unhappy</b> <b>about</b> the abandonment of head rubbing, and after a dispute between Eddy and a student over a refund was played out in the local press, he decided to go his own way.|$|E
5|$|Lord Nelson {{stayed at}} {{temporary}} lodgings in New Bond Street between 1797 and 1798, and again from 1811 to 1813. Thomas Pitt, 2nd Baron Camelford lived in Bond Street and was <b>unhappy</b> <b>about</b> {{the presence of}} the Bond Street Loungers. Already notorious for a violent and abusive temper, on 7 October 1801 he refused invitations to join in celebrations of peace between Britain and France (which led to the Treaty of Amiens), resulting in an altercation with several Loungers at his doorstep. Camelford retreated upstairs and fired upon the crowd with a pistol.|$|E

5|$|Nine months later, {{the family}} leaves Boston and drives to Los Angeles. Their teenage {{daughter}} Violet (Taissa Farmiga) is <b>unhappy</b> <b>about</b> the move. They {{come across a}} newly restored mansion where they are taken on a tour by {{the real estate agent}} Marcy (Christine Estabrook). She mentions the deaths of the previous owners, a gay couple named Chad and Patrick who died from an apparent murder/suicide. The family decides to buy the house and move in.|$|E
5|$|Plotland {{development}} {{elsewhere in}} Britain was bulldozed following the Second World War, and various {{attempts were made}} by the local council to demolish Jaywick, but there was resistance from residents, who campaigned against this and won a preservation order in 1970. The council were <b>unhappy</b> <b>about</b> a housing development sitting on such a flood-prone site, and modern conveniences were slow in arriving. A mains sewer system was only installed in 1977.|$|E
5|$|Production of the {{new version}} of the opening episode took place in what was to have been a three-week break for the cast between {{production}} blocks. Gina McKee was initially very concerned about having her character's early life story changed when she had already based elements of her later performance on the previously-established version. Eccleston was also <b>unhappy</b> <b>about</b> the sudden changes. However, McKee felt that the new version of episode one eventually made for a much stronger opening to the story.|$|E

5|$|Sarumpaet, {{born into}} a {{politically}} active Christian family in North Sumatra, initially studied architecture in Jakarta. After seeing a play by Willibrordus S. Rendra in 1969, she dropped out and joined his troupe. Five years later, after marrying and converting to Islam, she founded the Satu Merah Panggung; the troupe did mostly adaptations of foreign dramas. As she became increasingly concerned about her marriage and <b>unhappy</b> <b>about</b> the local theatre scene, two years later Sarumpaet left her troupe and began to work in television; she only returned in 1989, after divorcing her abusive husband.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the railway introduced new tensions {{between the government and}} the First Nations. The authorities wished to move the indigenous peoples to reservations north of the railway in order to cut them off from the United States border. For their part, the First Nations were <b>unhappy</b> <b>about</b> the railway being built through their lands, stole company horses and disrupted the construction work. The mounted police made arrests and the government reduced their rations: by 1883, the threat of starvation had forced the First Nations to relocate to the northern side of the line.|$|E
5|$|The {{early history}} of Marylebone is tied into the Great Central Railway (GCR)'s Great Central Main Line (GCML) {{extension}} into London. When Sir Edward Watkin became chairman of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS) in 1864, the line was not particularly lucrative as it had no direct connection to London. Watkin was <b>unhappy</b> <b>about</b> transferring traffic to the Great Northern Railway, and when he became chairman of the Metropolitan Railway in 1872, he decided to build a dedicated line between the MS and Central London.|$|E

5|$|Trollope {{expected}} his {{depiction of}} a fallen woman to be controversial, and unusually for him wrote a preface defending it. But the anticipated controversy never materialised, and contemporary reviewers tended to ignore that subplot, focussing instead on the courtship in the novel. Reviews were generally less than positive; many reviewers and readers who had acquired a taste for Trollope from the 1850s60s Barchester novels were <b>unhappy</b> <b>about</b> the darker tone of later novels such as this one.|$|E
5|$|Violence in Kentucky {{increased}} with {{the outbreak of}} the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783). Native Americans who were <b>unhappy</b> <b>about</b> the loss of Kentucky in treaties saw the war as a chance to drive out the colonists. Isolated settlers and hunters became the frequent target of attacks, convincing many to abandon Kentucky. By late spring of 1776, fewer than 200 colonists remained in Kentucky, primarily at the fortified settlements of Boonesborough, Harrodsburg, and Logan's Station.|$|E
5|$|Although Bo was {{initially}} <b>unhappy</b> <b>about</b> his reassignment in Chongqing, he soon resolved {{to use his}} new position as a staging ground {{for a return to}} higher national office. Bo made no secret of his desire to enter the nine-member Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) during the 18th Party Congress in autumn 2012, as all but two of the PSC members—including President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao—were expected to retire. The transition would be an opportunity for Bo to join the highest echelon of national leadership, likely as a replacement for ally Zhou Yongkang, secretary of the Central Political and Legislative Committee, serving {{as the head of the}} party's security apparatus.|$|E
50|$|In a 2013 {{television}} documentary film, Running from Crazy, Hemingway, then 51, talked of her bouts {{with mental illness}} and her still lingering issues with her siblings. She spoke of her family's struggles with alcoholism, mental illnesses and suicide. (In particular she mentioned how her sister Margaux's suicide continued to haunt her.) She also made claims that her parents' marriage was abusive and <b>unhappy,</b> and <b>about</b> abusive incidents in her childhood.|$|R

50|$|The story {{starts with}} Saba and Irtiza celebrating Eid, and enjoying their life in Pakistan. Soon after Irtiza {{decides to go}} to America for {{post-graduate}} studies. Saba is <b>unhappy</b> hearing <b>about</b> this and gets angry at Irtiza. Irtiza reasons with Saba and tells her {{that he will be}} back in 2 years. Saba understands that post-graduate studies is important for his career and agrees for him to go. Irtiza goes to America and whilst studying there develops feelings for his cousin (Saman).|$|R
5|$|Chairman Kelvin Thomas {{stepped down}} during the 2012 close season, to be {{replaced}} by owner Ian Lenagan. The 2012–13 season was blighted by injuries and patchy form: after opening the season with three wins and briefly heading the table, United lost their next six games, a pattern of inconsistency that was to continue throughout the season. United finished outside the play-offs for the third consecutive season, but manager Chris Wilder was given a further one-year contract in April 2013. Some Oxford fans were <b>unhappy</b> <b>about</b> the decision to renew Wilder's contract, having pressed for his sacking {{during the second half of}} the 2012–13 season.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began in}} early 1847, but {{relationships}} between the LB and SER broke down quickly. The SER were <b>unhappy</b> <b>about</b> the proposed line from Rye to Hastings via , which they viewed as too expensive compared to the alternative route via Whatlington. The LB objected to this route as it was longer, and consequently the SER dropped their proposals in November 1847. The land over Romney Marsh was unstable, and test trains were seen to tip over in heavy winds. The line was originally proposed to be single-track, though this was changed to double-track in June 1850.|$|E
5|$|The colonial {{government}} in the Congo depended on its military to maintain civil order and, above all, it depended on the loyalty of the native troops who made {{up the bulk of}} the Force Publique. Black non-commissioned Officers led by First Sergeant-Major Ngoie Mukalabushi, a veteran of the East Africa Campaign, munitied at Luluabourg in the central Congolese province of Kasaï in February 1944; the trigger for this was a plan to vaccinate troops who had served at the front, though the soldiers were also <b>unhappy</b> <b>about</b> the demands placed on them and their treatment by their white officers.|$|E
5000|$|Grumble. Grumble is {{the older}} brother of Mumbler. He gets his name from his temperament, always <b>unhappy,</b> always {{complaining}} <b>about</b> this and that.

6000|$|... "You {{can have}} no {{conception}} how <b>unhappy</b> I am <b>about</b> it. Of course Lady Fawn will tell me to go away. I went out on purpose to beg his pardon for what I said last night, and I just said the very same thing again." ...|$|R
6000|$|Herbert was <b>unhappy</b> too <b>about</b> Mrs. Hornblower's trouble. Harry {{had been}} one of the slighter cases, and was still in his room, a good deal subdued by the illness, and by the {{attention}} the lodger had shown him; for Herbert had spent many hours, when he had been supposed to be resting, in relieving Mrs. Hornblower, and she was now in a flood of gratitude, only longing to do everything for him herself. Had he not, as she declared, saved her son, body and soul? ...|$|R
5|$|While {{construction}} was underway the original terminus remained in use, although the LSWR was granted running rights through the station. On 23 February Major J. W. Pringle of the Board of Trade inspected {{the new building}} and expressed concerns over {{the safety of the}} arrangements for trains entering the station from the main line, which entailed crossing the LSWR's multiple tracks. He was also <b>unhappy</b> <b>about</b> the newly installed passenger lifts and the unfinished nature of the passenger terminus, but nonetheless approved the limited use of the new station for funeral trains. Soon after the transfer of LNC services to the new building the LSWR viaduct was widened to serve a greatly enlarged Waterloo station, destroying all traces of the original LNC terminus.|$|E
5|$|Having {{seen the}} concerto delle donne in Ferrara, Caccini created a rival group {{made up of}} his family and a pupil. This {{ensemble}} was sponsored by the Medici, and traveled as far abroad as Paris to perform for Marie de' Medici. Francesca Caccini had much success composing and singing {{in the style of the}} concerto delle donne. Beginning in 1585, rival groups were created in Florence by the Medici, Rome by the Orsini, and Mantua by the Gonzaga. There was even a rival group in Ferrara based in the Castello Estense, the very palace where the concerto delle donne performed. This group was formed by Alfonso's sister Lucrezia d'Este, Duchess of Urbino. She had lived at the Este court since 1576, and shortly after Margherita's marriage to Alfonso in 1579, Alfonso and his henchmen killed Lucrezia's lover. Lucrezia was <b>unhappy</b> <b>about</b> being replaced as the matron of the house by Margherita, and upset by the murder of her lover, leading to her desire to be separate from the rest of her family during her evening entertainments.|$|E
5|$|Innocent was {{succeeded by}} Alexander IV, who was facing {{increasing}} military {{pressure from the}} Empire. He {{could no longer afford}} to pay Henry's expenses, instead demanding that Henry compensate the Papacy for the £90,000 spent on the war so far. This was a huge sum, and Henry turned to parliament for help in 1255, only to be rebuffed; further attempts followed, but by 1257 only partial parliamentary assistance had been offered. Alexander grew increasingly <b>unhappy</b> <b>about</b> Henry's prevarication and in 1258 sent an envoy to England, threatening to excommunicate Henry if he did not first pay his debts to the Papacy and then send the promised army to Sicily. Parliament again refused to assist the King in raising this money. Instead Henry turned to extorting money from the senior clergy, who were forced to sign blank charters, promising to pay effectively unlimited sums of money in support of the King's efforts, raising around £40,000. The English Church felt the money was wasted, vanishing into the long-running war in Italy.|$|E
60|$|The local superintendent, who {{remained}} through the week {{while the other}} enlighteners went to other Chautauquas for their daily performances. The superintendent was a bookish, underfed man who worked hard at rousing artificial enthusiasm, at {{trying to make the}} audience cheer by dividing them into competitive squads and telling them that they were intelligent and made splendid communal noises. He gave most of the morning lectures, droning with equal <b>unhappy</b> facility <b>about</b> poetry, the Holy Land, and the injustice to employers in any system of profit-sharing.|$|R
50|$|Joking Apart is a 1978 play by English playwright Alan Ayckbourn. It {{was written}} in {{response}} to comments that Ayckbourn only ever wrote <b>about</b> <b>unhappy</b> couples. In this play, Richard and Anthea are a perfectly happy married couple, who inadvertently worsen {{the lives of those}} around them.|$|R
50|$|Gitti and Chris are a young German {{couple on}} {{vacation}} at Chris's family villa in Sardinia. Gitti {{is much more}} spontaneous and light-hearted than Chris, wanting {{to go out and}} try to make friends while Chris remains introverted, preferring to stay in and read, even hiding from his neighbour, Hans. When he tries to speak to Gitti <b>about</b> his <b>unhappy</b> feelings <b>about</b> his life and career she interrupts him to say that he over thinks everything and should consider settling down with her. Chris is taken aback by her outburst.|$|R
