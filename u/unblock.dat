40|$|Rippling is a {{heuristic}} {{technique for}} guiding rewriting of a goal {{with respect to}} one or more givens. Rewriting is restricted so that the similarities between goal and given are preserved and the movement of differences is directed and terminating. <b>Unblocking</b> is a technique for changing the differences to enable a subsequent ripple. The standard definition of rippling currently prevents certain, otherwise desirable, <b>unblocking</b> steps. In particular, some desirable <b>unblocking</b> steps increase the wellfounded measure on which the termination proof of rippling is based. We propose an alternative family of well-founded measures under which the combination of rippling and <b>unblocking</b> is terminating. These new measures extend the power of rippling. 1 Introduction Rippling 1 is a heuristic technique for guiding rewriting of a goal with respect {{to one or more}} givens [Bundy et al, 1993].

He managed, however, to complete a final volume of his autobiography, which covered the stroke and its effects as well as an edition of his collected journalism, mainly for The Daily Telegraph. He spent some time with his friend Lauren Bacall the day before he died. Bogarde died at his home in London from a heart attack on May 8, 1999, age 78. His ashes were scattered at his former estate in Grasse, Southern France.|$|E
25|$|Organisation: {{following}} the thrombotic event, residual vascular thrombus will be re-organised histologically with several possible outcomes. For an occlusive thrombus (defined as thrombosis within a small vessel {{that leads to}} complete occlusion), wound healing will reorganise the occlusive thrombus into collagenous scar tissue, where the scar tissue will either permanently obstruct the vessel, or contract down with myofibroblastic activity to <b>unblock</b> the lumen. For a mural thrombus (defined as a thrombus in a large vessel that restricts the blood flow but does not occlude completely), histological reorganisation of the thrombus does not occur via the classic wound healing mechanism. Instead, the platelet-derived growth factor degranulated by the clotted platelets will attract a layer of smooth muscle cells to cover the clot, and this layer of mural smooth muscle will be vascularised by the blood inside the vessel lumen {{rather than by the}} vasa vasorum.|$|E

25|$|User {{privacy in}} China {{is not as}} cut-and-dry {{as it is in}} other parts of the world. China, reportedly, has a much more {{invasive}} policy when Internet activity involves the Chinese government. For this reason, search engines are under constant pressure to conform to Chinese rules and regulations on censorship while still attempting to keep their integrity. Therefore, most search engines operate differently in China than in the other countries, such as the US or Britain, if they operate in China at all. There are two types of intrusions that occur in China regarding the internet: the alleged intrusion of the company providing users with Internet service, and the alleged intrusion of the Chinese government. The intrusion allegations made against companies providing users with Internet service are based upon reports that companies, such as Yahoo! in the previous example, are using their access to the internet users' private information to track and monitor users' Internet activity. The claims made against the Chinese government lies in the fact that the government is forcing Internet-based companies to track users private online data without the user knowing that they are being monitored. Both alleged intrusions are relatively harsh and possibly force foreign Internet service providers to decide if they value the Chinese market over internet privacy. Also, many websites are blocked in China such as Facebook and Twitter. However many Chinese internet users use special methods like a VPN to <b>unblock</b> websites that are blocked.|$|E

His {{original}} Special Moves included the Vulcan Punch (a rapid punch attack with fire effects), the Gatling Attack (a rushing series of punches), and the Super Argentine Back Breaker (in which Ralf tosses his opponent in the air and catches him). In KOF '95, he gain one new Special Move, the , in which Ralf jumps in the air and dives towards the opponent. In KOF '97, he gains the Ralf Kick, and in KOF '99 the Ralf Tackle. In KOF 2003, he loses the Ralf Tackle, but gains the Stealth Ralf Kick and the <b>Unblock.</b> His Super Special Move in KOF '94, is the Super Vulcan Punch, a more powerful version of the Vulcan Punch, while in KOF '96 he gains the Bareback Vulcan Punch, a version of the Super Vulcan Punch in which Ralf pins his opponent into the ground and unleashes a flurry of punches. In KOF '97, he gains the Galactica Phantom, a single but powerful punch which sends the enemy flying across the screen. In KOF 2002, he uses the Bareback Galactica Phantom as MAX2 move (a maximum level Super Special move), with an additional follow up gained in 2002 Unlimited Match which, at times, can lead to an instant kill. In KOF XIII, he gets the Jet Vulcan, a variant of the Super Vulcan Punch in which Ralf turns red with rage and unleashes a flurry of punches in front of him. In KOF XIV, he get the Ralf Super Phalanx, a combination of the Jet Vulcan and Galactica Phantom where Ralf unleashes eight punches in front of him which, if the last punch hits, will make his opponent stagger, allowing Ralf to finish off his opponent with a highly explosive straight.|$|E
40|$|Six {{experiments}} used rats {{to study}} blocking and <b>unblocking</b> of fear learning. An excitatory stimulus (A) blocked fear learning to a neutral stimulus (B). <b>Unblocking</b> of B occurred if the AB compound signaled {{an increase in}} unconditioned stimulus (US) intensity or number. Assessments of associative change during blocking showed that more was learned about B than A. Such assessments during <b>unblocking</b> revealed that more was learned about B than A following an increase in US intensity but not US number. These US manipulations had no differential effects on single-cue learning. The results show that variations in US intensity or number produce <b>unblocking</b> of fear learning, but for each there is a different profile of associative change and a potentially different mechanism...|$|R

500|$|In {{accordance}} with its Acceptable Use Policy, Valve retains {{the right to}} block and <b>unblock</b> customers' access to their games and Steam services when Valve's Anti-Cheat (VAC) software determines that the user is cheating in multiplayer games, selling accounts to others or trading games to exploit regional price differences. Blocking such users initially removed access {{to his or her}} other games, leading to some users with high-value accounts losing access because of minor infractions of the AUP. Valve later changed its policy to be similar to that of Electronic Arts' Origin platform, in which blocked users can still access their games but are heavily restricted, limited to playing in offline mode and unable to participate in Steam Community features. Customers also lose access to their games and Steam account if they refuse to accept changes to Steam's end user license agreements; this occurred in August 2012.
