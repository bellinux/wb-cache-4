40|$|In this paper, we prove an <b>unconditionnal</b> {{bound for}} the {{analytic}} rank (i. e the order of vanishing at the critical point of the L function) of the new part J^n_ 0 (q), of the jacobian of the modular curve X_ 0 (q). Our main resultis the following upper bound: for q prime, one has rank_a(J_ 0 ^n(q)) ≪ J_ 0 ^n(q) where the implied constant is absolute. All previously known non trivials bounds of rank_a(J_ 0 ^n(q)) assumed the generalized Riemann hypothesis; here, our proof is <b>unconditionnal,</b> and is based firstly on the construction by Perelli and Pomykala of a new test function {{in the context of}} Riemann-Weil explicit formulas, and secondly on a density theorem for the zeros of L functions attached to new forms...|$|E

We prove, on the one hand, density theorems for the zeros (similar {{to the results of}} Bombieri, Jutila, Motohashi, Selberg in the case of characters), which are applied in KM to obtain a sharp <b>unconditionnal</b> estimate of the (analytic) rank of the new part of J_ 0 (q); and, on the other hand, non-vanishing theorems at the critical point, showing that a positive proportion of L-functions are non zero there...|$|E

The Cauchy problem has been studied in any dimension d ≥ 1 by Benzoni, Danchin, and Descombes, who obtained local well-posedness results when the velocity is in H s for s>d/ 2 + 1. They noticed that one may expect to find some smoothing effect due to the dispersive effects, {{but there was no}} proof so far. Our aim here is to give such results in any dimension under their local existence assumptions. In the simpler case of dimension 1 we obtain <b>unconditionnal</b> Kato smoothing (local smoothing of 1 / 2 derivative). In higher dimensions a few additional hypotheses must be made to get smoothing and we briefly discuss the pertinence of these restrictions...|$|E
