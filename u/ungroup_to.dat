40|$|Recent {{studies of}} school-age {{children}} and adolescents have used social network analyses to characterize selection and socialization aspects of peer groups. Fewer network studies have been reported for preschool classrooms {{and many of those}} have focused on structural descriptions of peer networks, and/or, on selection processes rather than on social functions of subgroup membership. In this study we started by identifying and describing different types of affiliative subgroups (HMP- high mutual proximity, LMP- low mutual proximity, and ungrouped children) in a sample of 240 Portuguese preschool children using nearest neighbor observations. Next, we used additional behavioral observations and sociometric data to show that HMP and LMP subgroups are functionally distinct: HMP subgroups appear to reflect friendship relations, whereas LMP subgroups appear to reflect common social goals, but without strong, within-subgroup dyadic ties. Finally, we examined the longitudinal implications of subgroup membership and show that children classified as HMP in consecutive years had more reciprocated friendships than did children whose subgroup classification changed from LMP or <b>ungrouped</b> <b>to</b> HMP. These results extend previous findings reported for North American peer groups. Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia (FCT), National Science Fundation,National Institute of Food and Agricultur...|$|R

40|$|We develop {{of a line}} of work {{initiated}} by Curto and Itskov towards understanding the amount of information contained in the spike trains of hippocampal place cells via topology considerations. Previously, it was established that simply knowing which groups of place cells fire together in an animal's hippocampus is sufficient to extract the global topology of the animal's physical environment. We model a system where collections of place cells group and <b>ungroup</b> according <b>to</b> short-term plasticity rules. In particular, we obtain the surprising result that in experiments with spurious firing, the accuracy of the extracted topological information decreases with the persistence (beyond a certain regime) of the cell groups. This suggests that synaptic transience, or forgetting, is a mechanism by which the brain counteracts the effects of spurious place cell activity...|$|R

The Milanovic (Bulletin of Economic Research, 46, 81 - 90, 1994) measure is simple, accurate and has attractive decomposition properties. However its use is confined <b>to</b> <b>ungrouped</b> data. This paper derives and applies the analogue of the Milanovic 94 measure for the case of grouped data. Both the grouped and ungrouped formulae offer a useful toolkit for inequality measurement. ...|$|R

40|$|Aqueous {{alteration}} of primitive meteorites {{is among the}} earliest and the most widespread geological processes in the solar system. A better understanding of these processes would help us constrain the early evolution condition {{of the solar system}} and test models of thermal and chemical evolution of planetesimals. In this study, we extended our previous work on CM chondrites by further applying carbonate clumped isotope thermometry to other types of carbonaceous chondrites (GRO 95577, CR 1; Orgueil, CI; and Tagish Lake, <b>ungrouped</b> type 2) <b>to</b> determine the conditions of their aqueous alteration. Carbonate in GRO 95577 is almost exclusively calcite; both Orgueil and Tagish Lake contain complex mixtures of several carbonates, which necessitated stepped phosphoric acid digestion to separately analyze calcite, dolomite/ankerite and breunnerite. CO_ 2 gases derived from these acid digestions are exceptionally rich in sulfur and organic contaminants. While so far no consistent evidence suggests their influences on Δ_(47) after extensive purification, we are continuing working on this issue...|$|R

Alchuklanyen Russians (Victor Hkulovski) and (Yan Mukarovsky) and (Roman Aopsn) relied on the premise of conflict between the language of literary or poetic language routine and this discrepancy was caused by giving the language the usual significance by the trend for Chklana because they are responsible for the transfer of the message to listeners by basing to the outside world for this language, literary language and interested in bringing attention to the formal qualities of self to any internal relationships among signals language itself. ...|$|R
40|$|Vecchia's {{approximate}} likelihood for Gaussian process parameters {{depends on}} how the observations are ordered, which {{can be viewed as}} a deficiency because the exact likelihood is permutation-invariant. This article takes the alternative standpoint that the ordering of the observations can be tuned to sharpen the approximations. Advantageously chosen orderings can drastically improve the approximations, and in fact, completely random orderings often produce far more accurate approximations than default coordinate-based orderings do. In addition to the permutation results, automatic methods for grouping calculations of components of the approximation are introduced, having the result of simultaneously improving the quality of the approximation and reducing its computational burden. In common settings, reordering combined with grouping reduces Kullback-Leibler divergence from the target model by a factor of 80 and computation time by a factor of 2 compared <b>to</b> <b>ungrouped</b> approximations with default ordering. The claims are supported by theory and numerical results with comparisons to other approximations, including tapered covariances and stochastic partial differential equation approximations. Computational details are provided, including efficiently finding the orderings and ordered nearest neighbors, and profiling out linear mean parameters and using the approximations for prediction and conditional simulation. An application to space-time satellite data is presented...|$|R
40|$|To {{construct}} a genetic linkage {{map of the}} heterothallic yeast, Cryptococcus neoformans (Filobasidiella neoformans), we crossed two mating-compatible strains and analyzed 94 progeny for the segregation of 301 polymorphic markers, consisting of 228 restriction site polymorphisms, 63 microsatellites, two indels, and eight mating-type (MAT) -associated markers. All but six markers showed no significant (P < 0. 05) segregation distortion. At a minimum LOD score of 6. 0 and a maximum recombination frequency of 0. 30, 20 linkage groups were resolved, resulting in a map length of approximately 1500 cM. Average marker density is 5. 4 cM (range 1 - 28. 7 cM). Hybridization of selected markers to blots of electrophoretic karyotypes unambiguously assigned all linkage groups to chromosomes and led us {{to conclude that the}} C. neoformans genome is approximately 20. 2 Mb, comprising 14 chromosomes ranging in size from 0. 8 to 2. 3 Mb, with a ratio of approximately 13. 2 kb/cM averaged across the genome. However, only 2 of 12 <b>ungrouped</b> markers hybridized <b>to</b> chromosome 10. The hybridizations revealed at least one possible reciprocal translocation involving chromosomes 8, 9, and 12.

40|$|Numerical phylogenetic {{methods are}} applied {{in order to}} arrive at synapomorphic {{similarities}} between species of the stygobiont amphipod genus Pseudoniphargus. Character polarity is assessed by comparison with the relevant outgroups Parapseudoniphargus and Allomelita, within a cluster of presumedly interrelated genera of Hadzioidea. The degree of morphological differentiation of Pseudoniphargus is low and the available potential apomorphies are insufficient to resolve phylogenetic relationships to the species level. The inconsistency in the data is high, which may {{be a result of}} an underlying peripatric speciation model, difficulties in discriminating mutual exclusive and homologous character states, and a high probability of independent character evolution. Problems of phylogeny reconstruction at low taxonomic levels are universal. Accidental problems {{in the case of a}} stygobiont group are caused by troglomorphism, structural reduction, and senescent morphology. The results of the study lead to the recognition of four well-corroborated monophyletic groups; three consist of sister species only. Remaining taxa are <b>ungrouped</b> or belong <b>to</b> groups which do not emerge after all numerical approaches. The monophyletic groups of Pseudoniphargus are for the greater part geographically coherent and confined either to the Cantabrian Mountains, or to the Lusitanian-Atlantic region, or to the Betic Cordillera. The possible origin of Pseudoniphargus from a thalassostygobiont progenitor which arose in the eastern Atlantic part of the shallow Tethys sea is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Tafassasset is an {{exceptional}} meteorite {{that has been}} linked to both the CR chondrites and the primitive achondrites. Because previous evidence suggests it might be a primitive achondrite from a known chondrite type, we have undertaken a study of the petrology, geochemistry, and formation history of the meteorite. Tafassasset is predominantly FeO-rich olivine (∼ 58 %) yet contains abundant Fe,Ni-metal (∼ 10 vol. %) and sulfide (∼ 3 vol. %). Other phases include high- and low-Ca pyroxene, plagioclase, chromite, and phosphate. It has a recrystallized texture, containing equigranular grains that often meet at 120 ° triple junctions. There are no relict chondrules in the thin sections examined, although they have been reported previously. Electron microprobe analyses reveal homogeneous olivine (Fa 28. 6), both low-and high-Ca pyroxene (Fs 23. 6 Wo 3. 7 and Fs 12. 2 Wo 39. 3 ± 1), a range of plagioclase composition (An 23 – 47), Fe,Ni-metal (with 5. 3 – 36. 6 wt. % Ni and 0. 1 – 0. 8 wt. % Co), troilite, chromite, and Ca–phosphate. Bulk composition analyses reveal two chips depleted in refractory lithophile and some siderophile elements compared to CI chondrites. Exceptions are enrichments in Fe, Ni and Co. A third chip is essentially chondritic in bulk composition. Different stones of the meteorite have slightly different oxygen isotope composition, yet all lie in the CR chondrite trend with one in the acapulcoite–lodranite field. Thermodynamic calculations show that Tafassasset equilibrated at a temperature above the Fe,Ni–FeS eutectic and at an oxygen fugacity of ∼IW- 1. The texture, heterogeneous distribution of mineral phases, plagioclase composition, two-mineral closure temperatures, and bulk composition all provide evidence that Tafassasset partially melted on its parent body. A comparison with the CR chondrites, the brachinites, and two anomalous achondrites indicates that Tafassasset is most similar <b>to</b> <b>ungrouped</b> primitive achondrites Lewis Cliff (LEW) 88763 and Divnoe, and to the brachinites in overall petrography, modal mineralogy, mineral compositions, oxidation state, and bulk composition. The comparison also excludes the possibility that Tafassasset formed by partial melting of a CR chondrite. Tafassasset is a primitive achondrite and likely evolved on a parent body that experienced incomplete melting, never reached isotopic homogeneity, and was from the same oxygen isotopic reservoir as the CR chondrite parent body...|$|R
