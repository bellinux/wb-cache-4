40|$|The {{flow pattern}} has widely been {{recognized}} {{to have an}} impact on the exogenous non-metallic inclusion generation in the gating system and mold flux entrapment in the <b>uphill</b> <b>teeming</b> process. Thus, a well-controlled flow pattern during the teeming process can improve the quality of ingots and further increase the yield during steel production. The current study focused on investigating and optimizing the flow pattern of steel in the gating system and molds to improve steel cleanliness during the initial filling moment. A mathematical model considering a trumpet was initially compared to a reduced model only considering part of the runner channel. Thereafter, the influence of swirl blades implemented at the bottom of the vertical runner on the improvement of initial filling conditions in the molds was investigated in a model considering the entire mold system including a trumpet. The effects of a swirl blade orientation on a swirling flow were further discussed. The simulation results, when utilizing swirl blades, were also verified by plant trials performed at Scana Steel. In addition, a new novel swirling flow generation component, TurboSwirl, was studied in a model considering the entire mold system including a trumpet. The model was based on modifications of the refractory geometry at the elbow of the runners near the mold without the usage of an inserted flow control device in the gating system. Owing to its great potential for improving the flow pattern of steel during the initial filling moment, the effect of TurboSwirl on steel cleanliness was also studied. The results showed that the initial filling conditions during the <b>uphill</b> <b>teeming</b> process can be improved by using a swirl blade or a TurboSwirl in the gating system. This makes it possible to further decrease the initial position of mold powder bags. In addition, it reduces the possibilities of exogenous non-metallic inclusion generation in the gating system as well as mold flux entrapment in the mold during the <b>uphill</b> <b>teeming</b> process. However, the utilization of swirl blades created a considerable amount of droplets when steel entered the molds during the first couple of seconds, which also was verified by the plant trials. The introduction of TurboSwirl showed a greater potential than a swirl blade due to a more evenly distributed swirling flow. The DPM model adopted in the simulations revealed that the TurboSwirl can improve steel cleanliness by increasing the non-metallic inclusion collision rate both with respect to Stokes and turbulent collisions.

40|$|The {{flow pattern}} in the <b>uphill</b> <b>teeming</b> process {{has been found to}} be closely related to the quality of ingots and further to affect the yield of ingot production, which is crucial for the steel making process. The {{formation}} of non-metallic inclusion and entrapment of mold flux has been considered to be affected by the flow {{pattern in the}} gating system and molds by many previous researchers. The aim of this study is to investigate the flow pattern of steel in the gating system and molds during the initial filling stage. In addition, to study the utilization of swirl blade implemented at the bottom of the vertical runner on the improvement of initial filling condition in the mold. A three dimensional model of two molds gating system for 6. 2 ton ingots from Scana Steel was adopted in the present work. A reduced geometry model including one mold and a runner, based on the method from previous researchers, was also used for comparison with the current more extensive model. Moreover, a reduced geometry model including one swirl blade and a runner was simulated to find effects of an increased-length vertical runner on the flow pattern improvement at the vertical runner outlet. Flow pattern, hump height and wall shear stress were respectively studied. A reduced geometry with homogenous inlet conditions fails to describe the fluctuating conditions present as the steel enters the mold. However, the trends are very similar when comparing the (hump height-surface height) evolution over time. The implementation of swirl blades gives a chaotic initial filling condition with a considerable amount of droplets being created when steel enters the molds during the first couple of seconds. However, a more calm filling condition with less fluctuation is achieved at the molds after a short while. Moreover, the orientation of the swirl blades affects he flow pattern of the steel. A proper placement of a swirl blade improves the initial filling conditions. The utilization of swirl blades might initially result in larger hump height. However, it gives fewer fluctuations as the casting proceeds. In the model without swirl blades, the maximum wall shear stress fluctuates with a descending trend as the filling proceeds. An implementation of swirl blades can decrease and stabilize the wall shear stress in the gating system. A special attention should be made in choosing refractory at the center stone, the horizontal runner near center stone and the vertical runner at the elbow. This is where the wall shear stress values are highest or where the exposure times are long. QC 2012020...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis has been to {{evaluate}} the use of a swirl blade in the <b>uphill</b> <b>teeming</b> process through plant trials. Two series of trials were carried out at Scana Steel Stavanger AS. In the trials a divergent entrance nozzle with a 62 ° outlet angle were used when casting duplex stainless steel on a base plate with two 6. 2 tons ingots. All molds were burned onto the ingots; leading to problems with emptying the ingots from the molds and severe damages on the molds. To get a better insight during the casting and understand why the molds were burned onto the ingots; during the second series of trials one mold on each base plate were filmed {{in the beginning of the}} casting process. Evaluation of the castings indicated that splashing on the mold wall at an initial stage was one reason for the mold burned onto the ingot. Further, material samples were collected to evaluate the non-metallic inclusion composition and distribution with SEM when casting with a swirl blade compared to when casting without. The area percentage of the inclusions in the samples was 1 % and 2 % for samples casted with and without swirl blade respectively with d= 2. 8 mm. The inclusion size also varied for samples casted with and without swirl blade; 98 % of the inclusions were in the size range of 0 - 10 μm when casted with and in the size range 0 - 20 μm when casted without swirl blade. Syftet med denna uppsats har varit att utvärdera användningen av swirlblad i götgjutningsprocessen. Två serier med försök har utförts på Scana Steel Stavanger AS. I försöken användes en inloppssten med 62 °-vinklat utlopp, där duplexa rostfria stål göts på stigplan med två 6, 2 tons kokiller. Alla kokiller brände fast på göten, vilket ledde till svårigheter vid urtag av göten samt skador på kokillerna. För att få en bättre förståelse av varför kokillerna brände fast, filmades ett göt på vardera stigplan under den andra försöksserien. Utvärdering av försöken indikerar att en anledning till att kokillerna brände fast på göten var att det stänkte upp stål på kokillväggen i ett tidigt stadium. Vidare har materialprover samlats in för att utvärdera sammansättningen samt utspridningen av icke-metalliska inneslutningar i SEM då göt gjutits med swirlblad jämfört med utan. Area procenten i proverna var 1 % och 2 % då proverna gjutits med respektive utan swirlblad, med d= 2. 8 mm. Även storleken på inneslutningarna i prover som gjutits med och utan swirlblad skiljde sig åt, 98 % av inneslutningarna var i storleksintervallet 0 - 10 μm för prover gjutna med swirlblad medan de som gjutits utan var i storleksintervallet 0 - 20 μm.
