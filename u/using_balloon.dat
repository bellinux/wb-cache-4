He began cultivating that crop, building this house for his family. The house is from a construction perspective of its period, <b>using</b> <b>balloon</b> framing, but is stylistically conservative in its Greek Revival elements. The farm was economically successful, with the Burnham family adding tobacco drying barns in 1903 and the late 1910s (now demolished).|$|E

Built in 1895 <b>using</b> <b>balloon</b> framing, the two story wood frame structure was the first structure built in Saxman, and is the only surviving clan house of its type there. It has a hip roof, and is clad in shiplap siding. The front originally had a porch extending across the full width, but this has been reduced to just the central portion. Three totem poles flank the building, two eagle-topped poles to the right and a beaver pole to the left. An old Russian cannon stands near the house.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{not certain}} who {{introduced}} balloon framing in the United States. However, the first building <b>using</b> <b>balloon</b> framing was possibly a warehouse constructed in 1832 in Chicago, Illinois, by George Washington Snow. Architectural critic Sigfried Giedion cited Chicago architect J. M. Van Osdel's 1880s attribution, as well as A. T. Andreas' 1885 History of Chicago, to credit Snow as 'inventor of the balloon frame method'. In 1833, Augustine Taylor (1796-1891) constructed St. Mary's Catholic Church in Chicago using the balloon framing method. In the 1830s, Hoosier Solon Robinson published articles about a revolutionary new framing system, called [...] "balloon framing" [...] by later builders. Robinson's system called for standard 2x4 lumber, nailed {{together to form a}} sturdy, light skeleton. Builders were reluctant to adopt the new technology, however, by the 1880s, some form of 2x4 framing was standard.Alternatively, a precursor to the balloon frame may have been used by the French in Missouri as much as thirty-one years earlier.|$|E
5000|$|Erected in 1904, {{what would}} {{eventually}} become the main lodge was built <b>using</b> <b>balloon</b> construction, {{along with a}} wooden truss roof and asphalt shingles. The four-story building measured 13,000 sq ft and, in its final configuration, featured 18 guest rooms {{as well as a}} kitchen and a pair of dining rooms with a capacity of 200. In 1920, Whitehall resident Emanuel [...] "Manny" [...] Duttenhofer purchased this building, {{which was one of the}} two largest summer homes at Michillinda. Initially, he intended to make it a summer retreat for his family, but after the unexpected death of his wife he instead used it to host friends and relatives. Shortly thereafter, he opened the building as a public resort and christened it the Michillinda Beach Tavern. In 1933, the resort was renamed Michillinda Beach Lodge to differentiate itself from alcohol-serving saloons, many of which renamed themselves [...] "taverns" [...] after the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. During their ownership, Duttenhofer and his sisters helped to develop Michillinda into one of the area's most frequented resorts, and the increased demand necessitated the construction of a two-story, 10-room Annex.|$|E
5000|$|The first bikes {{used for}} {{descending}} {{were known as}} [...] "klunkers" [...] or [...] "paperboy bikes" [...] - sturdy cruisers <b>using</b> <b>balloon</b> tires and coaster brakes, designed by Ignatz Schwinn during the Great Depression. The bikes could endure abuse that would damage other bicycles by changing features from the Henderson and Excelsior motorcycles his company had built during the 1920s, including a heavy [...] "cantilevered" [...] frame with two top tubes and 2.125-inch-wide (54.0 mm) [...] "balloon" [...] tires from Germany. Innovations like the fat-tire Schwinn with derailleur gears by Russ Mahon of [...] The Morrow Dirt Club in Cupertino at the 1974 Marin County cyclo-cross and Gary Fisher's 1975 use of a tandem rear hub (from a flea market) with a drum brake threaded for a freewheel cluster developed the sport, and by 1979, two organizers and competitors of the Repack downhill, Charlie Kelly and Gary Fisher founded the company which named the sport, MountainBikes. As mountain biking grew during the 80s, downhill riders continued to use either rigid or limited-travel (under 2 in) suspension bicycles. Purpose-made downhill bikes started {{to appear in the}} 90s, with innovations such as dual crown forks and disc brakes, as well as more elaborate suspension designs.|$|E
