One tunnel went to a massive repair facility '#7' and garage for servicing <b>underground</b> <b>equipment.</b> In 1979 #1 tunnel, which became the main tunnel, was collared and a new drift created at 4800 level to recover silver {{at the top of the}} mine. Heavy equipment including jumbos, various air or electric scoop trams in 2 to 8 yd configurations, rockbolt jumbos, giraffes, shotcrete machines, hyabs, mancarriers, dozers, graders, and jeeps were used. Rockbreakers, downhole drills, fan drills, long hole drills, and TNT drills were some of the equipment used to drill for blasting tunnel faces.

Moreover, seats on mining equipment, historically, are inadequate relative to the ergonomic needs of the equipment operator. In the extreme, a mine vehicle seat has sometimes consisted of blocks of wood or a bent steel place bolted to the machine frame. Also, the lack of sufficient vertical clearance in some underground mines is an impediment to providing adequate shock isolation systems on mine equipment seats.

30|$|Mougel et al. {{proposed}} that the information is conveyed {{by one or more}} different rotational angle codes. In the drilling, a discontinuous angular displacement is detected by an underground gyroscope and the command is solved in the microprocessor. The intermittent command codes are generated by successive rotations of the drill rod at different angular velocities, which are also detected by the gyroscope and transmitted to the microprocessor for decoding. The decoded command is then sent to the control tool by the microprocessor to complete the delivery of the command [1]. In 2001, Schlumberger invented two kinds of signal transmission methods; one is the drill rod to rotate the command code generated by the continuous different angular speed and the detection of underground rotary instrument. The downlink command transmission system decodes in the microcomputer. The other is the use of underground rotary tool-sensitive drill pipe rotation angular velocity to generate the command code. In the microcomputer, the system decodes and sends the decoded command to control the <b>underground</b> <b>equipment.</b> The invention provided a comparatively economical transmission system, which avoided costly devices, and its downward transmission system was relatively complete. The system had an error detection function and the fault detection system was not affected by formation factors. In the reference [2], it was proposed by using inclinometer and three-axis magnetometer to monitor the rotation angle of drill pipe rotation rate, through the <b>underground</b> <b>equipment</b> to deal with inclinometer and three-axis magnetometer output command code. The magnetometer output in this method is affected by formation parameters and can only be used in uncased hole. These inventions provided a downstream command transmission method without a mud circulation system.|$|E

The system developed for this mine provided private telephone channels, environmental monitoring, and control of <b>underground</b> <b>equipment,</b> all on a single coaxial cable, with all system operations {{under the direction of}} a minicomputer. Many advanced features were incorporated into the system, such as paging of roving personnel, two-way section wireless, through-the-earth emergency communication, and redundant signal paths. Television was multiplexed into the system for <b>underground</b> <b>equipment</b> surveillance. A hoist radio system completed the complement of equipment at the mine. The second mine was a magnetite ore mine in eastern Pennsylvania that used block caving mining techniques. A radio system was developed that provided two-way communications between trackless vehicles and roving personnel.
