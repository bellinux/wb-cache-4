5|$|The gaseous {{diffusion}} process required suitable pumps that had to meet stringent requirements. Like the diffusers, they had to resist corrosion from the <b>uranium</b> <b>hexafluoride</b> feed. Corrosion would not only damage the pumps, but would contaminate the feed. They could not afford any leakage of <b>uranium</b> <b>hexafluoride,</b> especially if it was already enriched, or leak oil, which would react with the <b>uranium</b> <b>hexafluoride.</b> They had to pump at high rates, and handle a gas twelve times as dense as air. To meet these requirements, the SAM Laboratories chose to use centrifugal pumps. They were aware that the desired compression ratio of 2.3:1 to 3.2:1 was unusually high {{for this type of}} pump. For some purposes, a reciprocating pump would suffice, and these were designed by Henry A. Boorse at the SAM Laboratories, while Ingersoll Rand tackled the centrifugal pumps.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, Frisch {{moved to}} London {{to work with}} Chadwick and his cyclotron. Frisch built a Clusius tube there to study the {{properties}} of <b>uranium</b> <b>hexafluoride.</b> Frisch and Chadwick discovered that {{it is one of}} the gases for which the Clusius method will not work. This was only a minor setback because Simon was already in progress of establishing the alternative method of separation through ordinary gaseous diffusion.|$|E
5|$|At least 17,000metrictons of {{fluorine}} {{are produced}} each year. It costs only $5â€“8 per kilogram as <b>uranium</b> or sulfur <b>hexafluoride,</b> but many times {{more as an}} element because of handling challenges. Most processes using free fluorine in large amounts employ in situ generation under vertical integration.|$|R

The {{depleted}} UF 6 resulting from the isotope separation stage is converted into U 3 O 8 to enable its safe storage (conversion carried out by COGEMA). The UF 6 -> UO 2 conversion is performed in four identical plants : UF 6 is hydrolysed in the gaseous phase through a vertical reactor, then the UO 2 F 2 powder formed is pyrohydrolysed into U 3 O 8 powder through a lightly inclined rotary kiln. Modelling of these rotary kilns requires a deep understanding of solid hydrodynamic behaviour, because mass transfer and heat exchange are strongly dependent on the powder motion, especially regarding the quality and the duration of gas/solid contact...|$|R
2500|$|Proliferation of neptunium-237 - In designs {{utilizing}} a fluorinator, Np-237 appears with <b>uranium</b> as gaseous <b>hexafluoride</b> {{and can be}} easily separated using solid fluoride pellet absorption beds. No one has produced such a bomb, but Np-237's considerable fast fission cross section and low critical mass imply the possibility. When the Np-237 is kept in the reactor, it transmutes to short lived Pu-238. All reactors produce considerable neptunium, which is always present in high (mono)isotopic quality, and is easily extracted chemically.|$|R
5|$|Part of the K-300 complex {{was taken}} over by Union Carbide in August 1944, and was run as a pilot plant, {{training}} operators and developing procedures, using nitrogen instead of <b>uranium</b> <b>hexafluoride</b> until October 1944, and then perfluoroheptane until April 1945. The design of the gaseous diffusion plant allowed for it to be completed in sections, and for these to be put into operation while work continued on the others. J. A. Jones completed the first 60 stages by the end of 1944. Before each stage was accepted, it underwent tests by J. A. Jones, Carbide and Carbon and SAM Laboratories technicians to verify that the equipment was working and that there were no leaks. Between four and six hundred people devoted eight months to this testing. Perfluoroheptane was used as a test fluid until February 1945, when it was decided to use <b>uranium</b> <b>hexafluoride</b> despite its corrosive nature.|$|E
5|$|In November 1942 the Military Policy Committee {{approved}} {{the construction of}} a 600-stage gaseous diffusion plant. On 14 December, M. W. Kellogg accepted an offer to construct the plant, which was codenamed K-25. A cost plus fixed fee contract was negotiated, eventually totaling $2.5million. A separate corporate entity called Kellex was created for the project, headed by Percival C. Keith, one of Kellogg's vice presidents. The process faced formidable technical difficulties. The highly corrosive gas <b>uranium</b> <b>hexafluoride</b> had to be used, as no substitute could be found, and the motors and pumps would have to be vacuum tight and enclosed in inert gas. The biggest problem was the design of the barrier, which would have to be strong, porous and resistant to corrosion by <b>uranium</b> <b>hexafluoride.</b> The best choice for this seemed to be nickel, and Edward Adler and Edward Norris created a mesh barrier from electroplated nickel. A six-stage pilot plant was built at Columbia to test the process, but the Norris-Adler prototype proved to be too brittle. A rival barrier was developed from powdered nickel by Kellex, the Bell Telephone Laboratories and the Bakelite Corporation. In January 1944, Groves ordered the Kellex barrier into production.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} three years, Libby worked on the gaseous {{diffusion}} process for uranium enrichment. An atomic bomb required fissile material, and the fissile uranium-235 made up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium. The SAM Laboratories therefore {{had to find a}} way of separating kilograms of it from the more abundant uranium-238. Gaseous diffusion worked on the principle that a lighter gas diffuses through a barrier faster than a heavier one at a rate inversely proportional to its molecular weight. But the only known gas containing uranium was the highly corrosive <b>uranium</b> <b>hexafluoride,</b> and a suitable barrier was hard to find.|$|E
40|$|The down-blending of Russian {{highly enriched}} uranium (HEU) takes place at three Russian gaseous {{centrifuge}} enrichment plants.

40|$|During {{the summer}} of 1995, {{ultrasonic}} wall thickness data were collected for 100 steel cylinders containing depleted <b>uranium</b> (DU) <b>hexafluoride</b> located at Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP) in Paducah, Kentucky. The cylinders were selected for measurement to assess {{the condition of the}} more vulnerable portion of the cylinder inventory at PGDP. The purpose of this report is to apply the method used in Lyon to estimate the effects of corrosion for larger unsampled populations as a function of time. The scope of this report is limited and is not intended to represent the final analyses of available data. Future efforts will include continuing analyses of available data to investigate defensible deviations from the conservative assumptions made to date. For each cylinder population considered, two basic types of analyses were conducted: (1) estimates were made of the number of cylinders as a function of time that will have a minimum wall thickness of either 0 mils (1 mil = 0. 00 1 in.) or 250 mils and (2) the current minimum wall thickness distributions across cylinders were estimated for each cylinder population considered. Additional analyses were also performed investigating comparisons of the results for F and G yards with the results presented in Lyon (1995) ...|$|R
40|$|Work in the {{development}} of fluid-bed fluoride volatility processes is described. In these processes, uranium and plutonium in spent nuclear fuels are converted into hexafluoride compounds in a fluid-bed reactor. The <b>uranium</b> and plutonium <b>hexafluorides</b> are volatile and can be separated from fission products, cladding, and alloying materials by techniques such as vaporization and distillation. The experimental work was directed toward devising a fluorination procedure for uranium and plutonium dioxides which would result in a high degree of removal of uranium and plutonium as hexafluorides. In these experiments synthetic mixtures made up to simulate a charge for a fluidized bed reactor (100 kg U, 0. 4 kg Pu, approximates 1 kg F. P., and 30 kg inert solids) were used. High-purity recrystallized alumina was found to be a suitable material for use as the fluidized inert solid. After a 10 -hr fluorination period at 450 deg C, the concentrations of residual uranium and plutonium on the alumina were 0. 01 and 0. 03 wt%, respectively. A reaction temperature of 450 deg C was found to be optimum, since experiments at 500 and 550 deg C resulted in plutonium retentions on the alumina of 0. 060 and 0. 090 wt%, respectively. At all these temperatures, the residual uranium content of the residue was less than 0. 01 wt%. When fission product element oxides, in quantities that would be expected in a Dresden-type fuel after 100, 000 Mwd/ton burnup and 30 days of cooling, were added to the uranium dioxide-plutonium dioxide [...] alumina and the mixture was fluorinated at 450 deg C for 10 hr, the concentration of plutonium on the alumina increased to a value of 0. 065 U%. Additional recovery of the plutonium retained on the alumina was obtained by either pyrohydrolysis followed by refluorination at 450 deg C for 10 hr, or by refluorination alone at 550 deg C for 10 hr. These procedures reduced the residual plutonium content of the alumina to less than 0. 02 wt%. Experiments were also performed to determine the feasibility of using the same batch of alumina as the inert solid for the fluorinations of five batches of the urania [...] plutonia solid solution. Experiments were performed in which the solid solution of plutonium dioxide in uranium dioxide was oxidized prior to fluorination. The oxidation resulted in a powdered mixture of uranosic oxide and plutonium dioxide. Fluorination of this oxide mixture in alumina resulted in the removal of essentially all of the uranium in a reaction time of 2 hr at 450 deg C when 10 vol% fluorine was used. When this fluorination was followed by a second fluorination period of 5 hr at 550 deg C with 75 vol% fluorine, the plutonium content of the alumina was 0. 011 wt%. When both fluorination periods were extended to 10 hr each, the retention of plutonium was 0. 007 wt%, which corresponded to a removal of 99. 5 % of the plutonium contained in the solid mixture. During {{the first part of the}} fluorination period, in which the major portion of the uranium is removed from the mixture of uranium dioxide, plutonium dioxide, alumina, and representative fission product element oxides, a low ternperature (450 deg C) and a low concentration of fluorine (10 vol% fluorine in nitrogen) are desirable. However, in order to remove the plutonium efficiently during the last portion of the fluorination period, it is desirable to use a higher temperature (550 deg C) and a higher fluorine content of the gas mixture (75 vol% fluorine in nitrogen).

5|$|To be {{considered}} 'enriched', the uranium-235 fraction should be between 3% and 5%. This process produces huge quantities of uranium that is depleted of uranium-235 {{and with a}} correspondingly increased fraction of uranium-238, called depleted uranium or 'DU'. To {{be considered}} 'depleted', the uranium-235 isotope concentration should {{be no more than}} 0.3%. The price of uranium has risen since 2001, so enrichment tailings containing more than 0.35% uranium-235 are being considered for re-enrichment, driving the price of depleted <b>uranium</b> <b>hexafluoride</b> above $130 per kilogram in July 2007 from $5 in 2001.|$|E
5|$|The {{centrifuge}} process {{was regarded as}} the only promising separation method in April 1942. Jesse Beams had developed such a process at the University of Virginia during the 1930s, but had encountered technical difficulties. The process required high rotational speeds, but at certain speeds harmonic vibrations developed that threatened to tear the machinery apart. It was therefore necessary to accelerate quickly through these speeds. In 1941 he began working with <b>uranium</b> <b>hexafluoride,</b> the only known gaseous compound of uranium, {{and was able to}} separate uranium-235. At Columbia, Urey had Karl Cohen investigate the process, and he produced a body of mathematical theory making it possible to design a centrifugal separation unit, which Westinghouse undertook to construct.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of uranium {{was the focus}} of multiple studies by the Ames Project. The properties of the various uranium oxides and uranium hydride were investigated. The latter of was particular interest because at one point the Los Alamos Laboratory considered using it in an atomic bomb instead of metallic uranium, but the idea was found to be inefficient, and was shelved. A process was developed to recovery depleted uranium metal from the uranium tetrafluoride left over from the electromagnetic isotope separation process and <b>uranium</b> <b>hexafluoride</b> left over from the gaseous diffusion process. This was operated as a pilot plant that produced kilogram quantities, before being turned over to the Manhattan Project's SAM Laboratories for implementation on an industrial scale at Oak Ridge.|$|E
5|$|The gaseous {{diffusion}} process remained more encouraging, although it too had technical obstacles to overcome. By the end of 1943, Urey had over 700 people working for him on {{gaseous diffusion}}. The process involved hundreds of cascades, in which corrosive <b>uranium</b> <b>hexafluoride</b> diffused through gaseous barriers, becoming progressively more enriched at every stage. A major problem was finding proper seals for the pumps, but by far the greatest difficulty lay in constructing an appropriate diffusion barrier. Construction of the huge K-25 gaseous diffusion plant was well under way before a suitable barrier became available in quantity in 1944. As a backup, Urey championed thermal diffusion.|$|E
5|$|The {{need for}} {{fluorine}} {{arose from the}} need to separate the isotope235U from 238U because the former, present in natural uranium at a concentration of less than 1% is fissile (capable of sustaining a nuclear chain reaction of nuclear fission with thermal neutrons), whereas the latter is not. Members of the MAUD Committee (especially Francis Simon and Nicholas Kurti) proposed the use of gaseous diffusion for isotope separation, since, according to Graham's law the rate of diffusion is inversely proportional to molecular mass. After an extensive search, <b>uranium</b> <b>hexafluoride,</b> UF6, {{was determined to be}} the most suitable compound of uranium to be used for the gaseous diffusion process. Elemental fluorine is needed in the production of UF6.|$|E
5|$|Baxter {{was born}} in Wales, but grew up in England, {{entering}} the University of Birmingham at age 16. He joined Imperial Chemical Industries as a chemical engineer, and became head of the Central Laboratory of its General Chemicals Division in Widnes, investigating the chemistry of chlorine and fluorine. He {{was elected to the}} Widnes Municipal Council in 1939, a seat he held until 1949. During the Second World War he provided James Chadwick with samples of <b>uranium</b> <b>hexafluoride</b> for Tube Alloys, the British wartime nuclear weapons program, and later established a pilot plant to produce it in Widnes. In 1944, in response to a request from the Americans for someone with expertise in both uranium chemistry and industrial operations, he went to Oak Ridge, Tennessee, to assist the Manhattan Project.|$|E
5|$|In early September Nichols {{appointed}} a production control committee, headed by Major A.V. (Pete) Peterson. Peterson's staff tried various combinations, using mechanical calculating machines, {{and decided that}} the S-50 production should be fed to K-25 rather than Y-12, which was done in April 1945. The charts also showed that the proposed top stages for K-25 should be abandoned, as should Lawrence's recommendation to add more alpha stages to the Y-12 plant. Groves accepted their proposal to add more base units to the K-27 gaseous-diffusion plant and one more Beta stage track for Y-12. These additions were estimated to cost $100 million, with completion in February 1946. Soon after Japan surrendered in August 1945, Peterson recommended that S-50 be shut down. The Manhattan District ordered this on 4 September. The last <b>uranium</b> <b>hexafluoride</b> was sent to K-25, and the plant had ceased operation by 9 September. S-50 was completely demolished in 1946.|$|E
5|$|Production {{commenced}} in February 1945, and {{the first}} product was shipped to the calutrons in March. By April, the gaseous diffusion plant was producing 1.1 percent product. It was then decided that instead of processing <b>uranium</b> <b>hexafluoride</b> feed from the Harshaw Chemical Company, the gaseous diffusion plant would take {{the product of the}} S-50 thermal diffusion plant, with an average enrichment of about 0.85 percent. Product enrichment continued to improve, as more stages came online and performed better than anticipated. In June product was being enriched to 7 percent; by September it was 23 percent. The S-50 plant ceased operation on 9 September, and Kellex transferred the last unit to Union Carbide on 11 September 1945. Highly enriched uranium was used in the Little Boy atomic bomb used in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945.|$|E
5|$|Thorium Ltd, {{a company}} half owned by ICI that was {{involved}} in the production of radioactive substances, and was a consultant to the British nuclear energy program.

Baxter was personally responsible for the research and development that was the basis for the design of the Springfields <b>uranium</b> <b>hexafluoride</b> plant, and {{was a member of the}} committee that oversaw the construction of the chemical separation plant to extract plutonium. Much to Baxter's disappointment, ICI management did not see nuclear energy as being part of its core mission, and disengaged from it. He also became dismayed at political and economic developments in the United Kingdom after the Conservatives lost office in 1945.|$|E
5|$|Urey began {{considering}} {{isotope separation}} methods. The centrifuge process {{was regarded as}} the most promising.

Another possibility was gaseous diffusion, which George B. Kistiakowsky suggested at a lunch on May 21, 1940.|$|E
5|$|After the August 1943 Quebec Agreement merged the British and American {{atomic bomb}} projects, Mark Oliphant persuaded the Admiralty to release Massey {{to work on}} the Manhattan Project. In November 1943, Massey set out with Oliphant for the Radiation Laboratory at the University of California in Berkeley in a B-24 Liberator bomber. The Radiation Laboratory's part was to develop an {{electromagnetic}} isotope separation process. Massey was in charge of its Theoretical Group, which included American David Bohm and Australian Eric Burhop. They studied the characteristics of electric discharges in magnetic fields, today known as Bohm diffusion, and studied the ionization of uranium compounds used as feed in the electromagnetic uranium enrichment process such as uranium tetrachloride (UCl4) and <b>uranium</b> <b>hexafluoride</b> (UF6). Oliphant returned to Britain in March 1945, and was replaced as head of the British mission in Berkeley by Massey. Wartime papers produced by the group were collected and published in The Characteristics of Electrical Discharges in Magnetic Fields (1949).|$|E
5|$|Difficulties {{with the}} {{diffusers}} and pumps paled into insignificance besides {{those with the}} porous barrier. In order to work, the gaseous diffusion process required a barrier with microscopic holes, but not subject to plugging. It had to be extremely porous, but strong enough to handle the high pressures. And, like everything else, it had to resist corrosion from <b>uranium</b> <b>hexafluoride.</b> The latter criterion suggested a nickel barrier. Foster C. Nix at the Bell Telephone Laboratories experimented with nickel powder, while Edward O. Norris at the C. O. Jelliff Manufacturing Corporation and Edward Adler at the City College of New York worked on a design with electroplated metallic nickel. Norris was an English interior decorator, who had developed a very fine metal mesh for use with a spray gun. Their design appeared too brittle and fragile for the proposed use, particularly on the higher stages of enrichment, but there was hope {{that this could be}} overcome.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, Urey {{brought in}} Hugh S. Taylor from Princeton University {{to look at}} the problem of a usable barrier. Libby made {{progress}} on understanding the chemistry of <b>uranium</b> <b>hexafluoride,</b> leading to ideas on how to prevent corrosion and plugging. Chemical researchers at the SAM Laboratories studied fluorocarbons, which resisted corrosion, and could be used as lubricants and coolants in the gaseous diffusion plant. Despite this progress, the K-25 Project was in serious trouble without a suitable barrier, and by August 1943 it was facing cancellation. On 13 August Groves informed the Military Policy Committee, the senior committee that steered the Manhattan Project, that gaseous diffusion enrichment in excess of 50 percent was probably infeasible, and that the gaseous diffusion plant would be limited to producing product with a lower enrichment that could be fed into the calutrons of the Y-12 electromagnetic plant. Urey therefore began preparations to mass-produce the Norris-Adler barrier, despite its problems.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} war ended in August 1945, Lieutenant Colonel Arthur V. Peterson, the Manhattan District officer with overall {{responsibility}} for the production of fissile material, recommended that the S-50 plant be placed on stand-by. The Manhattan District ordered the plant shut down on 4 September 1945. It was the only production-scale liquid thermal diffusion plant ever built, but its efficiency could not compete with that of a gaseous diffusion plant. The columns were drained and cleaned, and all employees were given two weeks' notice of impending termination of employment. All production had ceased by 9 September, and the last <b>uranium</b> <b>hexafluoride</b> feed was shipped to K-25 for processing. Layoffs began on 18 September. By this time, voluntary resignations had reduced the Fercleve payroll from its wartime peak of 1,600 workers to around 900. Only 241 remained at the end of September. Fercleve's contract was terminated on 31 October, and responsibility for the S-50 plant buildings was transferred to the K-25 office. Fercleve laid off the last employees on 16 February 1946.|$|E
25|$|The Iranian {{nuclear program}} was {{launched}} in the 1950s. Iran is the seventh country to produce <b>uranium</b> <b>hexafluoride,</b> and controls the entire nuclear fuel cycle.|$|E
25|$|Large-scale {{productions}} of elemental fluorine began during World War II. Germany used high-temperature electrolysis to produce tons of chlorine trifluoride, a compound {{planned to be}} used as an incendiary. The Manhattan project in the United States produced even more fluorine for use in uranium separation. Gaseous <b>uranium</b> <b>hexafluoride</b> was used to separate uranium-235, an important nuclear explosive, from the heavier uranium-238 in diffusion plants. Because <b>uranium</b> <b>hexafluoride</b> releases small quantities of corrosive fluorine, the separation plants were built with special materials. All pipes were coated with nickel; joints and flexible parts were fabricated from Teflon.|$|E
25|$|The {{division}} of the MAUD Committee at Birmingham was led by Peierls. He was assisted by Haworth, Johnson and, from 28 May 1941, Klaus Fuchs. Haworth led the chemists in studying the properties of <b>uranium</b> <b>hexafluoride.</b> One thing in its favour was that fluorine has only one isotope, so any difference in weight between two molecules is solely due to the different isotope of uranium. Otherwise, {{it was far from}} ideal. It solidified at , was corrosive, and reacted with many substances, including water. It was therefore difficult and dangerous to handle. However, a search by the chemists at Birmingham failed to uncover another gaseous compound of uranium. Lindemann used his influence with Lord Melchett to get ICI to produce <b>uranium</b> <b>hexafluoride</b> on an industrial scale. It also explored methods of producing pure uranium metal.|$|E
25|$|The IAEA February 2013 report {{stated that}} Iran has resumed reconverting near-20% enriched uranium into Oxide form to {{fabricate}} {{fuel for the}} Tehran Research Reactor, which {{makes it more difficult}} to further enrich that uranium to weapons grade, since it would first need to be converted back to <b>uranium</b> <b>hexafluoride</b> gas.|$|E
25|$|Uranium {{and some}} other {{elements}} can {{be removed from the}} salt by a process called fluorine volatility: A sparge of fluorine removes volatile high-valence fluorides as a gas. This is mainly <b>uranium</b> <b>hexafluoride,</b> containing the uranium-233 fuel, but also neptunium hexafluoride, technetium hexafluoride and selenium hexafluoride, as well as fluorides of some other fission products (e.g. iodine, molybdenum and tellurium). The volatile fluorides can be further separated by adsorption and distillation. Handling <b>uranium</b> <b>hexafluoride</b> is well established in enrichment. The higher valence fluorides are quite corrosive at high temperatures and require more resistant materials than Hastelloy. One suggestion in the MSBR program at ORNL was using solidified salt as a protective layer. At the MSRE reactor fluorine volatility was used to remove uranium from the fuel salt. Also for use with solid fuel elements fluorine volatility is quite well developed and tested.|$|E
25|$|In the {{fluoride}} volatility process, fluorine is {{reacted with}} the fuel. Fluorine {{is so much}} more reactive than even oxygen that small particles of ground oxide fuel will burst into flame when dropped into a chamber full of fluorine. This is known as flame fluorination; the heat produced helps the reaction proceed. Most of the uranium, which makes up the bulk of the fuel, is converted to <b>uranium</b> <b>hexafluoride,</b> the form of uranium used in uranium enrichment, which has a very low boiling point. Technetium, the main long-lived fission product, is also efficiently converted to its volatile hexafluoride. A few other elements also form similarly volatile hexafluorides, pentafluorides, or heptafluorides. The volatile fluorides can be separated from excess fluorine by condensation, then separated from each other by fractional distillation or selective reduction. <b>Uranium</b> <b>hexafluoride</b> and technetium hexafluoride have very similar boiling points and vapor pressures, which makes complete separation more difficult.|$|E
25|$|The first {{large-scale}} {{separation of}} uranium isotopes {{was achieved by}} the United States in large gaseous diffusion separation plants at Oak Ridge Laboratories, which were established {{as part of the}} Manhattan Project. These used <b>uranium</b> <b>hexafluoride</b> gas as the process fluid. Nickel powder and electro-deposited nickel mesh diffusion barriers were pioneered by Edward Adler and Edward Norris. See gaseous diffusion.|$|E
25|$|Uranium dioxide (UO2) {{concentrate}} from mining is {{a thousand}} or so times as radioactive as the granite used in buildings. It is refined from yellowcake (U3O8), then converted to <b>uranium</b> <b>hexafluoride</b> gas (UF6). As a gas, it undergoes enrichment {{to increase the}} U-235 content from 0.7% to about 4.4% (LEU). It is then turned into a hard ceramic oxide (UO2) for assembly as reactor fuel elements.|$|E
25|$|By 1948, DuPont, which founded Kinetic Chemicals in {{partnership}} with General Motors, was producing over two million pounds (900 tons) of Teflon brand PTFE per year in Parkersburg, West Virginia. An early use was in the Manhattan Project as a material to coat valves and seals in the pipes holding highly reactive <b>uranium</b> <b>hexafluoride</b> at the vast K-25 uranium enrichment plant in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.|$|E
25|$|Long term fuel salt storage - If the {{fluoride}} fuel salts {{are stored}} in solid form over many decades, radiation can cause the release of corrosive fluorine gas and <b>uranium</b> <b>hexafluoride.</b> The salts must be defueled and wastes removed before extended shutdowns and stored above 100 degrees Celsius. Fluorides are less suitable for long term storage because some have high water solubility unless vitrified in insoluble borosilicate glass.|$|E
