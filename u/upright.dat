40|$|The mandibular second molars {{can become}} {{impacted}} beneath {{the crown of}} the first molars due to various causes and fail to erupt normally. Presented herewith is a case report of orthodontic <b>uprighting</b> of a mesioangular impacted mandibular right permanent second molar. Though various treatment options were available, an <b>uprighting</b> push spring appliance was used as {{it is easy to}} fabricate and produces distal tipping and <b>uprighting</b> of the impacted tooth without the necessity of surgical assistance, bone removal, or splinting. The <b>uprighting</b> of the mandibular second molar was achieved within two months...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve the {{automation}} level of wrecker, fuzzy PID controller for the <b>uprighting</b> was proposed. First, the <b>uprighting</b> model was built in this article. Then, the hydraulic circuit of wrecker <b>uprighting</b> system was built in AMESim. Furthermore, the fuzzy PID controller and the conventional PID controller were simulated respectively in Matlab software based on this model. Simulation {{results show that the}} fuzzy PID controller has faster step response speed and smaller overshoot than that of the conventional PID controller. The <b>uprighting</b> can be accomplished automatically and smoothly by virtue of the fuzzy PID controller...|$|R

5|$|A bike remains <b>upright</b> {{when it is}} steered so {{that the}} ground {{reaction}} forces exactly balance all the other internal and external forces it experiences, such as gravitational if leaning, inertial or centrifugal if in a turn, gyroscopic if being steered, and aerodynamic if in a crosswind.|$|E
5|$|A variant {{from the}} Gibson area has an <b>upright</b> habit and leaves. Otherwise, Banksia speciosa shows little {{variation}} across its range.

5000|$|<b>Uprights,</b> as noted, are {{typically}} aluminum tubing, fixed or telescopic, with heights from 3’ to 26’. Fixed <b>Uprights</b> refer to one piece vertical pipes that cannot break down in to smaller sections or otherwise adjust in height. Telescopic <b>Uprights</b> refer to two piece vertical pipes that are adjustable in height between a designated range (for example, 6 feet to 10 feet tall), allowing for more versatility if different events require varying heights.|$|R

50|$|There {{would be}} a set of rugby-style goal posts on each goal line, with two <b>uprights</b> 18 feet apart and a {{crossbar}} 10 feet high. A goal would have to pass between the <b>uprights</b> and over the crossbar to count.|$|R
30|$|This {{study showed}} that {{posterior}} teeth <b>uprighting</b> is usually obtained when using continues archwires and anterior vertical elastics to close anterior open bite, especially in the mandibular arch. However, <b>uprighting</b> of the posterior maxillary teeth is more difficult, primarily in extraction cases. Therefore, mechanical procedures such as the multiloop edgewise archwire technique [13, 14] or mesially angulating the posterior teeth accessories with continuous archwires [15 – 17, 24] are recommended to increase the possibility of actually <b>uprighting</b> the posterior teeth. If, in fact, this mesial angulation increases treatment stability, {{this will be a}} contributing factor. Nevertheless, despite some clinical evidence that <b>uprighting</b> the posterior teeth will increase treatment stability, this has yet to be investigated.|$|R

30|$|Further goal {{included}} recovering {{enough space}} for prosthetic {{replacement of the}} missing lower left first molar. This objective would have been achieved by reciprocal movements of the <b>uprighting</b> of the second lower left molar and by mesial movement of the left premolars to level the lower arch. In order to enable the <b>uprighting</b> of the 3.7, the lower left third molar was extracted. The maintenance of 3.8 was considered; however, the <b>uprighting</b> of 3.7 {{was thought to be}} faster and more predictable without the third molar.|$|R

5000|$|In {{its most}} {{familiar}} form, the illusion uses an apparatus which generally resembles {{the type of}} guillotine historically used for executions.

The inner faces of the <b>uprights</b> contain tracks within which runs a blade, and {{the upper end of the}} <b>uprights</b> supports a mechanism for raising, holding and then releasing the blade. In some versions of the illusion, the apparatus also has a bench attached to the <b>uprights</b> at the same level as the neck stocks, on which the [...] "victim" [...] lies down - usually in a face-down position. On other versions, the [...] "victim" [...] simply kneels behind the apparatus and places their neck in the stocks.|$|R
