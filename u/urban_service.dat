40|$|Extended {{abstract}} 1 - IntroductionIn {{recent decades}} {{as the population}} in cities of country, which had been influenced by natural population growth of cities and migration of people in towns and rural to middle cities and metro polices, increases city spaces and infrastructures, which are needed have not been equipped. <b>Urban</b> <b>services</b> are the means for managing urban development and a prominent cause in continuing city life, which without it the life of citizens has been stopped. Its optimal and systematic distribution consistent with the people’s demands {{in the process of}} urban planning is very important. <b>Urban</b> <b>services</b> have been considered as one of clear indicators of civilization from many years ago. Today as the civilization increases, <b>urban</b> <b>services</b> and their qualities have been regarded by experts, planners and citizens, so <b>urban</b> <b>services</b> have been followed by urbanization development. 2 - Methodology In this study through library studies, referring to the relevant agencies, field observation and analysis and evaluation the questionnaire given to residents of various neighborhoods in Estahban city with SPSS were presented. To evaluate the proportion of <b>urban</b> <b>services</b> and people demand six neighborhoods were chosen among 15 neighborhoods of Estahban. (Two neighborhoods of each region). These neighborhoods were chosen based on place- cluster sampling and also economic-social conditions of them and detailed plan of Estahban. In this research a wealthy neighborhood and poor neighborhood were chosen in each region. By using general Cochran formula we obtained 300 sample size. So 300 questionnaires had been distributed among the residents. 3 - DiscussionAfter 1350, Estahban city faces numerous problems in supplying <b>urban</b> <b>services,</b> because of population growth, physical development in addition to injustice distribution of <b>urban</b> <b>services.</b> These problems have also been strengthened by people who live in more deprived parts of the township to use the <b>urban</b> <b>services</b> at the center of township. Therefore, it should be said that lack of allocation of space and location of physical elements is considered as one the most important problems in Estahban. In this research we study how to overcome this problem and how to find different optimal switching ways and adjust it. The purpose of this research is surveying the local distribution of <b>urban</b> <b>services</b> based on people demand by using the factors such as participation in <b>urban</b> <b>services</b> development, supplement the <b>urban</b> <b>services</b> willing to assist to municipality and justice in distributing the <b>urban</b> <b>services,</b> in addition to recognizing the needs and priorities in the field of <b>urban</b> <b>services</b> in Estahban city. 4 - Conclusion Research findings show that people had a little participation in the distribution of <b>urban</b> <b>services</b> (in developing service). Municipalities and other organizations related to <b>urban</b> <b>services</b> run no survey to elicit people’s ideas about <b>urban</b> <b>services</b> in Estahban shortages and <b>urban</b> <b>services</b> needed in the city that has been met partially. So we can conclude that in distribution of <b>urban</b> <b>services</b> in Estahban city, they paid no attention to the need of people. Also the results show that concentration of <b>urban</b> <b>services</b> in the center and some regions of Estahban city cause the unsuitable distribution all over the city. This makes problems for citizens to use the services. Furthermore the distribution of <b>urban</b> <b>services</b> has been injustice, disordered and no planned. In this distribution, the partnership and advisory opinion of people have been ignored. So, the <b>urban</b> <b>services</b> distribution has been influenced by burse, the price of land, vacant space all over the city and the managers’ opinion and people’s need haven’t been considered in it.

25|$|In the Chilean rural areas, the {{ministry}} of health and {{the ministry}} of economy are responsible for supervising water cooperatives and water committees. In rural areas there is no independent regulator, such as the SISS in urban areas. Since 1994, the Direction for Water Works (DOH) is in charge of executing the national program of Rural Potable Water (APR). Unlike <b>urban</b> <b>service</b> providers, rural water supply and sanitation sector has not been subject of regulation like urban services. Currently, the Government of President Bachelet has submitted before the Chilean Congress a Bill to give this sector a new institutional framework. According to Law 19,549 of 1998, urban concessionaires have to provide technical and administrative assistance to water committees and cooperatives in their respective region.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} {{categories}} of <b>urban</b> <b>service</b> providers in Morocco: private concessionnaires (38% of urban water customers), municipal utilities (31%), the national public company ONEE (28%), and municipalities providing services directly (3%). De jure, {{according to the}} municipal code of 1976 (Charte Communale), amended in 2002 and 2008, public services such as water supply, sewerage and electricity distribution are the responsibility of municipalities (communes). There are 1,547 municipalities in Morocco, including 249 urban and 1,298 rural municipalities. As mentioned above, some municipalities have delegated service provision to private concessionnaires. In other municipalities the Régies provide these services, often {{not on the basis}} of a specific contract. In the smaller municipalities ONEE often provides services, either with or without a contract (contrat de gestion déléguée) with the municipality. In the case of sewers, many smaller municipalities still provide this service directly, although there is a policy to gradually transfer sewer services to ONEE.|$|E
25|$|Despite these challenges, major {{achievements}} {{were achieved}} in the sector {{around the turn of}} the millennium when wide-ranging reforms were carried out, flanked by substantial donor support. Through the reforms <b>urban</b> <b>service</b> provision was decentralized to commercially run local corporations. The utilities substantially increased tariffs, despite the political sensitivity of the topic in a poor country, and managed to increase cost recovery. Despite these increases water remains affordable with the average share of total monthly household expenditure on water and sewerage at about 1.1% of total expenditures. The average monthly expenditure on the widely used stimulant qat is about eight times the amount paid for the water and sewer bill. Between 1995 and 2008, 2.8 million people in Yemen gained access to an improved water source and 7.5 million to improved sanitation. According to a survey carried out in 2008 in 7 towns, 89% of the customers of water utilities said they were satisfied with the service level of their water utility, and only 9% were dissatisfied. In Sana'a, the collection efficiency of water and sewer bills increased from 60% to 97% during the same period. However, it declined again to 60% in 2011.|$|E
