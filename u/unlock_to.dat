25|$|Using the {{original}} Mega Man and Mega Man 2 {{as the main}} inspiration for the gameplay in Mega Man 9, several significant features from previous games were left out. Specifically, Mega Man lacks the ability to slide along {{the ground and the}} ability to charge up his Mega Buster for more powerful shots. Aside from using or omitting various elements from past games in the series, Mega Man 9 introduces a time attack mode and 50 optional challenges where certain requirements should be met to be accomplished. These range from defeating a boss using only the Mega Buster to clearing the entire game without taking any damage. Downloadable content for all three versions of the game was made available for purchase during October 2008. Proto Man can be downloaded as an alternate playable character. Proto Man is able to slide, can charge up his buster, and takes double the damage of Mega Man, among other differences. Additional downloadable add-ons include higher difficulty modes, an endless stage, and a special stage featuring a new boss, Fake Man. In the later release of the game as part of Mega Man Legacy Collection 2, instead of having actual DLC, completing the game or entering the secret code at the Mega Man 9 title screen is the new requirement to <b>unlock</b> <b>to</b> acquire the former DLC extra material.|$|E

50|$|The {{strength}} of today's magnetic locks compares well {{with that of}} conventional door locks and they cost less than conventional light bulbs to operate. There are additional pieces of release hardware installed in a typical electromagnetic locking system. Since electromagnetic locks do not interact with levers or door knobs on a door, typically a separate release button that cuts the lock power supply is mounted near the door. This button usually has a timer that, once the button is pressed, keeps the lock unlocked for either 15 or 30 seconds in accordance with NFPA fire codes. Additionally a second release is required by fire code. Either a motion sensor or crash bar with internal switch is used to <b>unlock</b> <b>to</b> door on the egress {{side of the door}} automatically.|$|E

In Delicious: Emily's Wonder Wedding Premium/Platinum Edition it is revealed that Emily is around 32 years old. She is the game's main character, and is kind-hearted, though sometimes a little naive. No one would dare say she's not a hard worker though and when she has her mind set on something, she really goes for it. Managing your personal life can be quite a challenge. Especially when you have to manage your own restaurant on top of that! At the end of Delicious: Emily's Wonder Wedding, Emily marries her husband Patrick. At the end of Delicious: Emily's Honeymoon Cruise, in a bonus scene that players must <b>unlock</b> <b>to</b> see, she is shown to be going into labour with her and Patrick's first child, daughter Paige, the same scene is shown in the beginning of Delicious: Emily's New Beginning.|$|E

5000|$|A well car, {{also known}} as a double-stack car or stack car (also well wagon), is a type of {{railroad}} car specially designed to carry intermodal containers (shipping containers) used in intermodal freight transport. The [...] "well" [...] is a depressed section which sits close to the rails between the wheel trucks of the car, allowing a container to be carried lower than on a traditional flatcar. This makes it possible to carry a stack of two containers per unit on railway lines (double-stack rail transport) wherever the loading gauge assures sufficient clearance. The top container is secured to the bottom container either by a bulkhead built into the car (e.g., bottom and top containers are the same dimensions of 40 ft.), or through the use of inter-box connectors (IBC). Four IBCs are needed per wellcar. In the process of an inbound train becoming an outbound train, there are four processes: <b>unlock</b> <b>to</b> unload the top container of inbound train, remove then unload bottom container, insert after loading bottom container of outbound train, lock after top container loaded.|$|E

Angela Napoli is Emily's younger sister. While she is extremely flirtatious and irresponsible in her early appearances, she settles down and gets married in Delicious: Emily's True Love, to an older man named Jimmy. In Delicious: Emily's Childhood Memories, Angela is shown to be just as much of a troublemaker when she was growing up. Despite their differences, Angela and Emily are very close, though Emily is frequently exasperated with her sister's antics. Angela has helped out in several of the restaurants before - however, several [...] "crisis events" [...] involve Emily trying to prevent Angela from causing trouble in between serving her customers. In Delicious: Emily's Honeymoon Cruise she runs the cruise ship's boutique. At some point she moves to New York City (with her husband Jimmy).

40|$|Cavity {{ringdown}} spectroscopy (CRDS) {{makes use}} of light retention in an optical cavity to enhance the sensitivity to absorption or extinction of light from a sample inside the cavity. When light entering the cavity is stopped, the output is an exponential decay with a decay constant {{that can be used}} to determine the quantity of the analyte if the extinction or absorption coefficient is known. The precision of the CRDS is dependent on the rate at which the system it acquires and processes ringdowns, assuming randomly distributed errors. We have demonstrated a CRDS system with a ringdown acquisition rate of 1. 5 kHz, extendable to a maximum of 3. 5 kHz, using new techniques that significantly changed the way in which the ringdowns are both initiated and processed. On the initiation side, we combined a custom high-resolution laser controller with a linear optical feedback configuration and a novel optical technique for initiating a ringdown. Our optical injection 2 ̆ 2 unlock 2 ̆ 2 method switches the laser off-resonance, while allowing the laser to immediately return to resonance, after terminating the <b>unlock,</b> <b>to</b> allow for another ringdown (on the same cavity resonance mode). This part of the system had a demonstrated ringdown initiation rate of 3. 5 kHz. To take advantage of this rate, we developed an optimized cost-effective FGPA-based data acquisition and processing system for CRDS, capable of determining decay constants at a maximum rate of 4. 4 kHz, by modifying a commercial ADC-FPGA evaluation board and programming it to apply a discrete Fourier transform-based algorithm for determining decay constants. The entire system shows promise with a demonstrated ability to determine gas concentrations for H 2 O with a measured concentration accuracy of ± 3. 3...|$|E
