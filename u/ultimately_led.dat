5|$|However, in 1978 and 1979, {{the real}} {{exchange}} rate appreciated because inflation consistently outpaced {{the rate of}} depreciation. The overvaluation <b>ultimately</b> <b>led</b> to capital flight and a financial collapse.|$|E
5|$|Although The Thrill Book {{has been}} {{described}} as the first American pulp to specialize in fantasy and science fiction, this description is not supported by recent historians of the field, who regard it instead as a stepping stone on the path that <b>ultimately</b> <b>led</b> to Weird Tales and Amazing Stories, the first true specialized magazines in the fields of weird fiction and science fiction respectively.|$|E
5|$|By this time, Genesis were {{suffering}} from press attention being exclusively directed towards frontman Gabriel {{at the expense}} of the rest of the band, a notable factor that <b>ultimately</b> <b>led</b> to Gabriel leaving the group in 1975. They took an extended break in 1974 following the Selling England by the Pound tour; Collins joined a side project, Brand X, while Rutherford worked with former Genesis guitarist Anthony Phillips.|$|E

50|$|However, Gerwani’s socialist {{vision of}} the “new Indonesian woman” must also be contextualized vis-à-vis their {{relationship}} with the PKI - particularly because this affiliation was <b>ultimately,</b> what <b>led</b> to the Gerwani being targeted, and later banned in the Suharto’s New Order.|$|R
5|$|In 1895, the Marquess of Queensbury {{was charged}} at Vine Street Police Station with libel against Oscar Wilde. This <b>ultimately</b> <b>led</b> to Wilde's arrest and {{subsequent}} imprisonment. On 29 May 1901, the stonemason James Schulty reported he had {{information about the}} murder of Mary Ann Austin but refused to reveal details anywhere except the Vine Street Police Station. The information was discarded by the Metropolitan Police as little value.|$|E
5|$|In any case, {{the proof}} inaugurated {{a line of}} {{research}} that <b>ultimately</b> <b>led,</b> through the work of Bell in 1964 on Bell's theorem, and the experiments of Alain Aspect in 1982, to the demonstration that quantum physics either requires a notion of reality substantially {{different from that of}} classical physics, or must include nonlocality in apparent violation of special relativity.|$|E
5|$|On 1 March 1985, Jim Sullivan {{began his}} career as NBN's news director, which has <b>ultimately</b> <b>led</b> him to become Australia's longest serving news director.

Allchin's move to Microsoft was widely publicized.|$|R
5|$|The {{mission was}} part of an effort by MirCorp to {{refurbish}} and privatize the aging Mir space station, which was nearing the end of its operational life. Further commercially funded missions beyond Soyuz TM-30 were originally planned to continue the restoration efforts of the then 14-year-old space station, but insufficient funding and investment <b>ultimately</b> <b>led</b> to the de-orbit of the station in early 2001.|$|E
5|$|The {{principle}} of the liberum veto preserved the feudal features of Poland's political system, weakened {{the role of the}} monarchy, led to anarchy in political life, and contributed to the economic and political decline of the Polish state. Such a situation made the country vulnerable to foreign invasions and <b>ultimately</b> <b>led</b> to its collapse.|$|E
5|$|Thom's {{work with}} the food chemist James N. Currie in 1916–17 enabled them to develop a process to mass-produce citric acid using Aspergillus, {{and a few years}} later, the first {{large-scale}} mold fermentation factory had been established in Brooklyn, New York. This early work <b>ultimately</b> <b>led</b> to the Department of Agriculture's establishing four Regional Research Laboratories in 1938 that were devoted to industrial mold fermentations.|$|E

5|$|A {{few years}} after {{settling}} down in Berlin, Accum had a house built at 16 Marienstraße (later 21 Marienstraße), where he dwelt until his death. During his last years, he suffered from {{a bad case of}} gout, which <b>ultimately</b> <b>led</b> to his death. His illness took a serious turn for the worse in June 1838, and he rapidly deteriorated. On June 28, approximately 16 years after he return to Germany, Accum {{died at the age of}} 69 in Berlin. He was buried there at the Dorotheenstädtischen Friedhof.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1916, Canadian {{physicist}} Robert William Boyle {{and other}} scientists of the Anti-Submarine Detection Investigation Committee (ASDIC) undertook research which <b>ultimately</b> <b>led</b> {{to the development of}} sonar technology. Acoustic sounding equipment was developed which could be operated much more rapidly than the sounding lines, thus enabling the German Meteor expedition aboard the German research vessel Meteor (1925–27) to take frequent soundings on east-west Atlantic transects. Maps produced from these techniques show the major Atlantic basins, but the depth precision of these early instruments was not sufficient to reveal the flat featureless abyssal plains.|$|E
5|$|Differences {{of opinion}} over social order between {{northern}} and southern states in early United States society, particularly regarding the slavery of Africans and African Americans, <b>ultimately</b> <b>led</b> to the American Civil War. Initially, states entering the Union alternated between slave and free states, keeping a sectional balance in the Senate, while free states outstripped slave states in population and in the House of Representatives. But with additional western territory and more free-soil states, tensions between slave and free states mounted with arguments over federalism and disposition of the territories, whether and how to expand or restrict slavery.|$|E

50|$|Like {{several of}} his {{predecessors}} Nikolaus II pursued a military career. He is remembered for his amassing a large art collection, for his musical patronage of Haydn and Beethoven, for his sexual debauchery, and for his high expenditures. <b>Ultimately</b> these <b>led</b> to the family being placed under a sequestration order, roughly the equivalent of bankruptcy.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Ultimately,</b> this <b>led</b> to {{the overall}} {{predominantly}} European ancestry of today's Paisa population according to testing of autosomal DNA or atDNA, despite the asymmetrical sex-specific genetic markers that they inherited from the founding population which indicates their Y-DNA as being predominantly from European male forebears and mtDNA as being predominantly from Amerindian female ancestors.|$|R
5|$|Entwistle's son, Christopher, gave a {{statement}} supporting the Who's decision to carry on. The US tour {{began at the}} Hollywood Bowl with touring bassist Pino Palladino. Townshend dedicated the show to Entwistle, and ended with a montage of pictures of him. The tour lasted until September. The loss of {{a founding member of}} the Who caused Townshend to re-evaluate his relationship with Daltrey, which had been strained over the band's career. He decided their friendship was important, and this <b>ultimately</b> <b>led</b> to writing and recording new material.|$|E
5|$|Fort Stanwix {{occupied}} a strategic western portage {{known as the}} Oneida Carrying Place (site of modern Rome, New York) between the Mohawk River, which flowed southeast to the Hudson River, and Wood Creek, whose waters <b>ultimately</b> <b>led</b> to Lake Ontario. Built by the British in 1758 during the French and Indian War on the only dry ground in the area, the fort had fallen into disrepair. When the American Revolutionary War widened in 1776 to include the frontier areas between New York and the Province of Quebec, the site again became strategically important.|$|E
5|$|Goldschmidt's {{appointment}} was initially {{expected to meet}} with little opposition. Several state senators, however, voiced concerns about Goldschmidt's involvement with SAIF and possible improprieties in the dealings {{he and his wife}} had with Texas Pacific. Senator Vicki Walker, in particular, emerged as an outspoken critic of Goldschmidt. The increased scrutiny on Goldschmidt's career, including reporters' difficulties accessing records from his time as governor, <b>ultimately</b> <b>led</b> to the revelation of an illegal sexual relationship with a minor girl, which had occurred decades before, during his time as Mayor of Portland. These revelations ended Goldschmidt's extensive career at the center of Oregon politics and policymaking.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ultimately</b> this <b>led</b> to an {{appointment}} as a Justice in the Supreme Court of India in December 1988. After six years, Ahmadi was appointed as Chief Justice of India in October 1994. Ahmadi became the third Muslim ever {{to serve as}} Chief Justice of India. After serving {{for two and a}} half years, he eventually stepped down to retire in March 1997.|$|R

5|$|However, {{attempting}} to reconcile electromagnetic theory with two observations, the photoelectric effect, and the nonexistence of the ultraviolet catastrophe, proved troublesome. Through {{the work of}} leading theoretical physicists, a new theory of electromagnetism was developed using quantum mechanics. This final modification to electromagnetic theory <b>ultimately</b> <b>led</b> to quantum electrodynamics (or QED), which fully describes all electromagnetic phenomena as being mediated by wave–particles known as photons. In QED, photons are the fundamental exchange particle, which described all interactions relating to electromagnetism including the electromagnetic force.|$|E
5|$|In general, Greece {{enjoyed a}} period of peace and {{prosperity}} during Alexander's campaign in Asia. Alexander sent back vast sums from his conquest, which stimulated the economy and increased trade across his empire. However, Alexander's constant demands for troops and the migration of Macedonians throughout his empire depleted Macedon's manpower, greatly weakening it {{in the years after}} Alexander, and <b>ultimately</b> <b>led</b> to its subjugation by Rome after the Third Macedonian War (171–168 BC).|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{from the}} Department of Civil Aviation {{believed}} water {{in some of}} the fuel tanks of VH-ANA was responsible for rough running of {{one or more of the}} engines; and this <b>ultimately</b> <b>led</b> to intermittent failure of all the engines. The Inquiry led by Mr Justice Simpson found no evidence that there was significant water in the fuel tanks. No radio call was received from Amana to indicate the nature of any problem, or even that the crew was aware of a problem. The Inquiry concluded without determining the cause of the crash.|$|E
