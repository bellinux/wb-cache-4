5|$|Upon activation, ERK may phosphorylate {{a number}} of cytoplasmic and nuclear {{molecules}} that ultimately result in the protein synthesis and morphological changes observed in L-LTP. These cytoplasmic and nuclear molecules may include transcription factors such as CREB. ERK-mediated changes in transcription factor activity may trigger the synthesis of proteins that <b>underlie</b> the maintenance of L-LTP. One such molecule may be protein kinase Mζ (PKMζ), a persistently active kinase whose synthesis increases following LTP induction. PKMζ is an atypical isoform of PKC that lacks a regulatory subunit and thus remains constitutively active. Unlike other kinases that mediate LTP, PKMζ is active {{not just in the}} first 30 minutes following LTP induction; rather, PKMζ becomes a requirement for LTP maintenance only during the late phase of LTP. PKMζ thus appears important for the persistence of memory and would be expected to be important in the maintenance of long-term memory. Indeed, administration of a PKMζ inhibitor into the hippocampus of the rat results in retrograde amnesia with intact short-term memory; PKMζ does not {{play a role in the}} establishment of short-term memory. PKMζ has recently been shown to <b>underlie</b> L-LTP maintenance by directing the trafficking and reorganization of proteins in the synaptic scaffolding that <b>underlie</b> the expression of L-LTP. Even more recently, transgenic mice lacking PKMζ demonstrate normal LTP, questioning the necessity of PKMζ.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, the {{development}} of Theory of Mind {{may play a role}} in emotional development. Theory of Mind is the ability to know that the experience of knowledge and intention lies behind human actions such as facial expressions. Although it is reported that very young infants have different responses to humans than to non-human objects, Theory of Mind develops relatively gradually and possibly results from predictable interactions with adults. However, some ability of this kind must be in place before mutual communication through gaze or other gesture can occur, as it does by seven to nine months. Some neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, have been attributed to the absence of the mental functions that <b>underlie</b> Theory of Mind. It is possible that the congenital absence of this ability, or the lack of experiences with caregivers who communicate in a predictable fashion, could <b>underlie</b> {{the development}} of reactive attachment disorder.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In an <b>underlay</b> {{cognitive}} radio network, the sec-ondary (<b>underlay)</b> transmitters generate interference to a pri-mary receiver, while an <b>underlay</b> receiver {{is subject to}} interfer-ence from both the primary transmitters and other <b>underlay</b> transmitters not associated with it. Although guard regions, maximum allowable <b>underlay</b> transmit powers, and contention distances help guarantee a minimum performance to the primary network, no such safeguard exists for the <b>underlay</b> network. To this end, this paper characterizes the aggregate interference on an <b>underlay</b> receiver while considering power control and receiver association schemes for both networks. Transmitters and receivers of both networks {{are assumed to be}} distributed as independent Poisson fields in the 2 -D plane, and all links undergo exponential path loss and Rayleigh fading. We derive the moment generating function of the aggregate interference on an <b>underlay</b> receiver and its outage probability. We show that the interference from the primary network does not depend on any node density, and that it dominates the aggregate interference. Furthermore, it is shown that increasing primary and <b>underlay</b> receiver densities reduce the outage probability under lower required power thresholds for the primary receivers. I...|$|R

5|$|Dysregulation of the {{ubiquitin}} proteasome {{system may}} contribute to several neural diseases. It may lead to brain tumors such as astrocytomas. In some of the late-onset neurodegenerative diseases that share aggregation of misfolded proteins as a common feature, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, large insoluble aggregates of misfolded proteins can form and then result in neurotoxicity, through mechanisms that are not yet well understood. Decreased proteasome activity has been suggested {{as a cause of}} aggregation and Lewy body formation in Parkinson's. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that yeast models of Parkinson's are more susceptible to toxicity from α-synuclein, the major protein component of Lewy bodies, under conditions of low proteasome activity. Impaired proteasomal activity may <b>underlie</b> cognitive disorders such as the autism spectrum disorders, and muscle and nerve diseases such as inclusion body myopathy.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} concept of <b>underlying</b> {{inflation}} and the properties of various measures of <b>underlying</b> inflation in the Australian context. <b>Underlying</b> inflation measures are routinely calculated and monitored by central banks in many countries, including the Reserve Bank of Australia. Alternative measurement concepts are explored, {{and a range of}} measures that have been calculated for Australia are discussed and evaluated on the basis of statistical criteria. These criteria capture the intuition that a good measure of <b>underlying</b> inflation should be less volatile than CPI (or headline) inflation, be unbiased with respect to CPI inflation, and capture the ‘trend’ in CPI inflation so that, on average, CPI inflation will tend to adjust towards the measure of <b>underlying</b> inflation. In the Australian context, statistical measures of <b>underlying</b> inflation, such as the trimmed mean or weighted median, perform fairly satisfactorily against these criteria. The performance of these measures can be further improved by seasonally adjusting prices at the CPI component level.
