40|$|Abstract: If forming and {{consolidating}} {{a favorable}} {{image of the}} bank among service consumers represents a marketing problem, then solving it requires numerous instruments from the marketing policies; the most important role is attributed to the audit. The final goal of the marketing audit is drawing up a table regarding the performances and {{the efficiency of the}} bank, in relation to the risks involved by financial institutions and its operations. In this respect, specialists in banking management have come up with different models of calculations and rating systems in their trials to obtain the most accurate scan of the “state of health ” of the banks, and moreover in their trials to identify the institutions which face financial and operational difficulties leading to bankruptcy. The <b>uniform</b> <b>bank</b> rating system is a specific instrument for the supervising activity and has its origins in the USA 1; it has later been borrowed by German, Italian, Great Britain authorities, which use influential components in their banking system; later on, their system was adopted by most central banks within the European Union.
