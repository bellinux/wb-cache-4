5|$|The most {{important}} act {{of civil disobedience}} during the Pittston strike was Moss 3. Since the strike {{had been going on}} for a few months, with no settlement expected in the near future, <b>union</b> <b>members</b> began to lose hope. Thousands of people had already been arrested and a lot of money had been spent on a cause that seemed to be never ending. <b>Union</b> <b>members</b> knew that something had to be done to regain the spirit of the strike and make it clear to Pittston that they would not give up.|$|E
5|$|Silver Reef's {{residents}} {{rebuilt the}} businesses {{that had been}} destroyed, but the town soon began to decline. In 1881, the Stormont Mining Company and the Barbee & Walker Mining Company had to decrease wages from $4 per day to $3.50 per day in all of their mines except the Savage mine (a Stormont property). In response to the decrease in wages, the Silver Reef Miners Union was formed. In February 1881, <b>union</b> <b>members</b> began talking about striking the mines, and as word of this potential strike spread, the Stormont Mining Company discharged those of its miners {{who were part of}} the Miners Union. In response, the discharged <b>union</b> <b>members</b> escorted the company's superintendent, Washington Allen, out of Silver Reef. Allen immediately went to the Second District Court in Beaver and filed a lawsuit against the <b>union</b> <b>members.</b> Before they went to court, the <b>union</b> <b>members</b> held a meeting and decided to shut down the Savage mine. Led by Matthew O'Loughlin, the president of the Silver Reef Miners Union, they walked through Silver Reef in rows of two, and, upon arriving at the Savage mine, O'Loughlin and nine other men went into the hoisting works and ordered the engineer on duty to shut down the pumps that kept water from the water table out of the mine. After the pumps were shut down, the group of ten went into the Savage mine and ordered everyone out.|$|E

5|$|After the First World War ended, severe discontent among farmers (over wheat prices) and <b>union</b> <b>members</b> (over wage rates) {{resulted}} in an upsurge of radicalism, coupled with a polarization over the rise of Bolshevism in Russia. The most dramatic result was the Winnipeg general strike of 1919. It began on 15 May and collapsed on 25 June 1919; as the workers gradually returned to their jobs, the Central Strike Committee decided to end the movement.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{widespread}} vandalism and violence, only twenty arrests {{were made on}} the day. The strikers intimidated the police, {{and only a few}} were willing to arrest vandals. Chief Hyland and many officers were sympathetic to the strike, but the local judicial magistrates were not. According to one union report, <b>union</b> <b>members</b> who were arrested faced fines up to $50, while the arrested strikebreakers were immediately acquitted by a local judge.|$|E

5|$|Rick Neuheisel {{came off}} the bench to lead the Chargers to three second-half scores. Partly based on this performance, the Buccaneers later signed Neuheisel as a backup quarterback. Although many veteran NFL players crossed the picket line during the week, the Buccaneers were one of only six teams to have no players cross. More than 1,000 area <b>union</b> <b>members</b> joined the Buccaneers regulars in {{picketing}} the game, with some fans tearing up their tickets and joining them.|$|E
5|$|The UMWA {{tried to}} focus the strikers on civil disobedience and often stepped in to stop the wildcat strikers. The <b>union</b> <b>members</b> used many {{different}} nonviolent strike tactics. These acts included standing and blocking the roads that the coal trucks would travel, mass sit down strikes, and large groups of people picketing outside of the Pittston coal mines. This method of protesting helped the UMWA gain support from other people around the country.|$|E
5|$|A riot {{that lasted}} four days broke out on November 2 when strikebreakers {{attempted}} to restart transit services. At its height, {{eight to ten}} thousand rioters flooded downtown Indianapolis and vandalized the city's main business district. Numerous workers, strikebreakers, policemen, and bystanders were injured. Two strikebreakers and four <b>union</b> <b>members</b> were killed. The city police were unable to control the situation and refused orders to combat the rioters as the violence worsened. After pleas for help from city leaders following continued rioting on Election Day, Governor Samuel Ralston called out the Indiana National Guard and put the city under martial law {{on the evening of}} November 5.|$|E

5|$|After {{the assault}} on his deputies, El Paso County Sheriff M.F. Bowers wired the {{governor}} and requested {{the intervention of the}} state militia (predecessor to the Colorado National Guard). Governor Davis H. Waite, a 67-year-old Populist, dispatched 300 troops to the area on March 18 under the command of Adjutant General T.J. Tarsney. Tarsney found the area tense but quiet. Union president Calderwood assured him that <b>union</b> <b>members</b> would cooperate with his operations, even surrendering for arrest if requested. Convinced that Bowers had exaggerated the extent of the chaos in the region, Tarsney recommended the withdrawal of troops; Waite concurred. The state militia left Cripple Creek on March 20.|$|E
5|$|Ballot papers {{proposing a}} {{national}} strike were {{sent out to}} <b>union</b> <b>members</b> on 17 September. On 8 October {{it was announced that}} postal workers had voted three to one in favour of taking strike action over job security and working conditions. The first round of strikes were later scheduled for Thursday 22 October and Friday 23 October. These would consist of two 24-hour stoppages, with mail centre staff and drivers striking on 22 October and delivery and collection staff doing likewise the following day.|$|E
5|$|Curtis, {{with the}} backing of Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge, {{rejected}} the Storrow Commission's proposal. He proceeded with department trials of the 19 and on September 8 found them guilty of union activity. Rather than dismiss them from the police force, he extended their suspensions. He later explained that he was giving them an opportunity to reconsider their actions and avoid discharges, which would have been irrevocable. The police <b>union</b> <b>members</b> responded that same day by voting 1134 to 2 in favor of a strike and scheduled it to start at evening roll call the next day. Their stated grounds omitted wages and working conditions. They said the strike's rationale was to protest the Commissioner's denial of their right to ally themselves with the AFL.|$|E

5|$|Despite advance {{sales of}} 40,000 tickets, only 4,919 fans {{showed up to}} the first strike game played by {{replacement}} players. Neither team had any of its regular players on the roster. Detroit punter Mike Black's 3rd-quarter fumble on the 3-yard line set up Harold Ricks' game-winning touchdown run. The Buccaneers' three second-quarter touchdowns overcame the Lions' early 17-point lead. 17 of the Buccaneers' points resulted from Lions turnovers. Around 1,000 <b>union</b> <b>members,</b> including UAW president Owen Bieber, joined the Lions on the picket lines. Attendance was also likely influenced by a baseball game taking place the same day, in which the Detroit Tigers defeated the Toronto Blue Jays to win the A.L. East Championship.|$|E
5|$|During the Pittston strike, the UMWA {{wanted to}} only use nonviolent means of {{protest against the}} company. Many <b>union</b> <b>members</b> practiced this method of civil disobedience and found {{creative}} ways for their message to be heard such as mass sit down strike and road blockades. However, many wildcat strikers ignored {{the request of the}} UMWA and used violence to express the anger that they felt toward the Pittston Coal Company. By the time the strike had ended, over 4,000people had been arrested for their actions.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} the company confirmed, on 19 February 2007, that 130 workers would {{be laid off}} {{for a period of}} twenty days due to a drop in product sales. The Transport and General Workers' Union then called for the government to provide compensation to the workers affected. The Transport and General Workers' Union paid out hardship monies from union funds to <b>union</b> <b>members,</b> on top of any state benefits to which the laid-off workers were entitled and a one-off £100 payment from Bernard Matthews.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, wildcat {{action was}} taken by <b>union</b> <b>members</b> over a {{decision}} by Gate Gourmet not to renew the contracts of 670 workers {{and replace them with}} agency staff; it is estimated that the strike cost British Airways £30million and caused disruption to 100,000 passengers. In October 2006, BA became involved in a civil rights dispute when a Christian employee was forbidden to wear a necklace bearing the cross, a religious symbol. BA's practice of forbidding such symbols has been publicly questioned by British politicians such as the former Home Secretary John Reid and the former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw.|$|E
5|$|Industrial {{production}} of munitions {{was a central}} feature of the war, and with {{a third of the}} men in the labour force moved into the military, demand was very high for industrial labour. Large numbers of women were employed temporarily. Trade unions gave strong support to the war effort, cutting back on strikes and restrictive practices. Membership increased by 692% from 4.1 million in 1914, to 28.3 million by 1920. 65% of <b>union</b> <b>members</b> had been associated with the Trades Union Congress (TUC) In 1914, rising to 77% in 1920. Labour's prestige had never been higher, and it systematically placed its leaders into Parliament.|$|E
