Only 8 weeks to go, the band feels that with the constantly shifting goalposts and challenging conditions of the organisers, they can't let it drag on any longer and want to make this announcement, to be clear to Blur fans that they won't be there. We've done our very best to work with the organisers and considered every option to make it happen, but they've let <b>us</b> <b>down</b> and let everyone else down too.|$|E
500|$|The Fiery Trial was {{published}} in 2010 by W.W. Norton & Company. The book's title is a quotation from Lincoln's December 1, 1862 State of the Union address, {{in which he said}} of the Civil War: [...] "Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history. We of this Congress and this administration, will be remembered in spite of ourselves ... The fiery trial through which we pass, will light <b>us</b> <b>down,</b> in honor or dishonor, to the latest generation." ...|$|E

It's a shame, but they can still get the album in Asia and the US."

[...] On {{the day before the}} full Senate vote, Kennedy gave an impassioned speech against Thomas, declaring that the treatment of Hill had been [...] "shameful" [...] and that [...] "o give {{the benefit of the doubt}} to Judge Thomas is to say that Judge Thomas is more important than the Supreme Court." [...] He then voted against the nomination. [...] Thomas was confirmed by a 52–48 margin, the narrowest ever for a successful nomination.|$|E
500|$|The Baltimore Sun critic, Mary Carole McCauley, {{noted that}} the book was more serious than the {{previous}} novels in the series and had more straightforward prose. Furthermore, reviewer Alice Fordham from The Times wrote that [...] "Rowling's genius is not just her total realisation of a fantasy world, but the quieter skill of creating characters that bounce off the page, real and flawed and brave and lovable". Fordham concluded, [...] "We have been a long way together, and neither Rowling nor Harry let <b>us</b> <b>down</b> in the end". The New York Times writer Michiko Kakutani agreed, praising Rowling's ability to make Harry both a hero and a character that can be related to.|$|E

500|$|The duo reprised their {{performance}} at KIIS-FM's Wango Tango music festival in Los Angeles, on May 14, 2011. Lopez wore a shiny gold catsuite for the performance, {{which did not}} go as planned when halfway through the performance her microphone failed. She continued performing for 20 seconds, before realising that she had lost sound. According to lifestyle website Female First, Lopez proceeded to dance, and urged the audience to sing along. At {{the end of the}} performance, Lopez addressed the crowd straight after the performance, saying [...] "We ain't gonna let that get <b>us</b> <b>down,</b> right? Nobody keeps mama down." [...] After Pitbull informed her of the malfunction, she turned to the band asking them to start from the beginning so that she could perform the song again.|$|E
500|$|The {{read-through}} for [...] "Cold War" [...] {{took place}} on 6 June 2012, with filming beginning on 13 June. For the submarine setting, the cast would be sprayed in between every take. The scenes in which the characters are drenched in water were achieved by constantly pouring [...] "gallons and gallons of water" [...] on the cast. Coleman found the experience fun, while Smith said that it made acting easier. Coleman said, [...] "The whole make-up process was reversed as they would damp <b>us</b> <b>down</b> {{in the morning and}} rub my mascara off!" [...] For the shots of the submarine in the ocean, a model was used. It was suspended upside-down with [...] "shredded feathers" [...] blown at it to give the effect of being under the sea.|$|E
500|$|In {{the last}} game of the series, the Mavericks {{defeated}} the Lakers, eliminating them. Barea was the second-leading scorer for his team with 22 points and 8 assists. During the fourth quarter, Lakers' center Andrew Bynum threw an elbow at Barea as he was driving for a layup. Barea fell down hard while Bynum was immediately ejected. Although Barea recovered and finished the game, he called the foul [...] "dangerous". Initially Bynum was unapologetic about the incident saying, [...] "We were getting embarrassed. They were breaking <b>us</b> <b>down.</b> So I just fouled somebody." [...] He later issued a formal apology to the league and Barea. The NBA suspended Bynum {{for the first five}} games in the next season, but later shortened the suspension to four games due to the lockout-shortened season.|$|E

500|$|Ruth Harrison, {{writing for}} FemaleFirst magazine, gave the album 4/5, saying that Talbot has [...] "a great voice {{when it comes}} to swing, but lets <b>us</b> <b>down</b> in parts". Harrison said that Talbot {{struggled}} with the [...] "rock sound" [...] associated with [...] "Merry Christmas Everybody", but said that the vocals on [...] "Ave Maria" [...] are [...] "incredible", and that the bonus tracks [...] "really are a bonus". The Leicester Mercury published a review from a nine-year-old critic, Natasha Dattani, who said that Talbot [...] "has a nice voice, it's very cute", and added that [...] "older people, like grandparents, will really like" [...] the album. James Whittle, writing for the South China Morning Post, described the album as [...] "chock-a-block with old-time favourites", calling Talbot [...] "sweet-voiced".|$|E

And we said, 'But you've got eleven songs, and if you can't find a hit in one of them then you're shit out of luck because that's what we're giving you.' So we're like saying to them, 'Right, you write the fucking hit song and we'll record it.' That shut the guy up and that was the last time we had any kind of meetings like that!" ...|$|E
500|$|After Lincoln was elected, Nicolay, who {{continued}} as Lincoln's private secretary, recommended that Hay be hired {{to assist him}} at the White House. [...] Lincoln {{is reported to have}} said, [...] "We can't take all Illinois with <b>us</b> <b>down</b> to Washington" [...] but then [...] "Well, let Hay come". Kushner and Sherrill were dubious about [...] "the story of Lincoln's offhand appointment of Hay" [...] as fitting well into Hay's self-image of never having been an office-seeker, but [...] "poorly into the realities of Springfield politics of the 1860s"—Hay must have expected some reward for handling Lincoln's correspondence for months. Hay biographer John Taliaferro suggests that Lincoln engaged Nicolay and Hay to assist him, rather than more seasoned men, both [...] "out of loyalty and surely because of the competence and compatibility that his two young aides had demonstrated". Historian Joshua Zeitz argues that Lincoln was moved to hire Hay when Milton agreed to pay his nephew's salary for six months.|$|E

500|$|Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique {{gave the}} episode a largely {{positive}} review, awarding it four stars out of four. Vitaris was complimentary towards the episode's exposition, and wrote, [...] "above all, 'The Unnatural' {{is about the}} power of storytelling. We don't really know if Dales' story is true or if it's the liquor-fueled ramblings of a broken-down man, but in the end, this is irrelevant." [...] Melissa Runstrom from Michigan Daily called it a [...] "charming independent story," [...] but that it [...] "seems to say more about the human condition than about any extraterrestrial plot". Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files wrote, [...] "In his entertaining debut as an X-Files writer/director, Duchovny took <b>us</b> <b>down</b> a very familiar path this season: [...] But unlike some previous navigators, Duchovny stayed on course, made sure we saw all of the spectacular landmarks along the way and, when we reached our final destination, I found I thoroughly enjoyed the ride." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Turn Up the Music" [...] is an uptempo {{electronic}} dance, {{and house}} song, which {{last for a}} duration of three minutes and forty-nine seconds. Instrumentation is provided by pulsating beats, synthesizers and percussion. Rap-Up described the production as [...] "synth-heavy". The song opens with Brown singing [...] "Turn up the music cause the sun just came up / Turn up the music {{if they try to}} turn <b>us</b> <b>down</b> / Turn up the music cause I'm trying to hear the speakers blow / Turn up the music, fill your cup and drink it down". It is then followed by repeated chants of [...] "If you're sexy and you know it put your hands up in the air". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard noted that the chanting was a reference to LMFAO's [...] "Sexy and I Know It" [...] (2011). Andy Kellman of Allmusic likened the song to Baltimora's [...] "Tarzan Boy" [...] (1985).|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of the record, David Bowie praised the band, writing, [...] " [...] might be all shamrocks and deutsche marks to some, but I feel that they {{are one of the few}} rock bands even {{attempting}} to hint at a world which will continue past the next great wall—the year 2000." [...] Although the record was a success, in the years following its release, the group have regarded it with mixed feelings and rarely play its material in live performances. Bono said, [...] "I thought of Zooropa at the time as a work of genius. I really thought our pop discipline was matching our experimentation and this was our Sgt. Pepper. I was a little wrong about that. The truth is our pop disciplines were letting <b>us</b> <b>down.</b> We didn't create hits. We didn't quite deliver the songs. And what would Sgt. Pepper be without the pop songs?" [...] The Edge said that he did not think the songs were [...] "potent", further stating, [...] "I never thought of Zooropa as anything more than an interlude... but a great one, as interludes go. By far our most interesting." [...] Clayton said, [...] "It's an odd record and a favourite of mine." ...|$|E

500|$|Barker {{began using}} the {{pseudonym}} Gerald Wiley when writing sketches because he wished the pieces {{to be accepted}} on merit {{and not just because}} he, as a star of the programme, had written them; he continued this tradition with the material he wrote later in his career. Barker brought his sketches in, claiming they had come from Wiley through Barker's agent Peter Eade, and they were very well received. To maintain the deception, Barker had criticised material he himself had submitted under the pseudonym; when a Wiley-credited sketch about a ventriloquist had been poorly received by the audience Barker told Corbett [...] "Well, Gerald Wiley let <b>us</b> <b>down</b> there", and on another occasion, when looking at a script, [...] "I don't understand this line. What's he getting at?" [...] One of the first sketches he wrote was called [...] "Doctor's Waiting Room", with the main part written for Corbett. Barker encouraged Corbett to buy the rights to the sketch and, further maintaining the myth, told him to reject Wiley's 'request' for £3,000 as too expensive, before giving Corbett the sketch for free. Speculation began about Wiley's identity, with Tom Stoppard, Frank Muir, Alan Bennett and Noël Coward all rumoured. After the second series of Frost on Sunday, the cast and crew were invited to a Chinese restaurant, while Wiley said that he would reveal himself. Barker, who had told Corbett earlier in the day, stood up and announced he was Wiley, although initially nobody believed him.|$|E
500|$|The Giants {{were unable}} to build on their success in 1982, {{due in part to}} the 1982 NFL Players Strike which reduced the {{schedule}} to 9 games, and also to Ray Perkins' mid-season announcement that he was leaving the team at season's end to coach at the University of Alabama. The Giants lost their first two games before the strike and their first game upon returning. In New York's second game (against Green Bay on Monday Night Football) Carson recorded 25 tackles; 20 solo and 5 assists. They then won their next three games [...] against the Detroit Lions, the Houston Oilers, and Philadelphia to even their record at 3–3. Perkins then announced that he was leaving to coach the University of Alabama in place of the retiring Bear Bryant after the season. The team's defensive coordinator, Bill Parcells, was chosen to replace him after a series of informal discussions with Young, during which Parcells did not know he was being interviewed for the position. Parcells named Bill Belichick the team's defensive coordinator and linebackers coach before the season. Belichick would later coach the New England Patriots to four Super Bowl titles. Simms, who had been unable to stabilize the quarterback situation up to that point, missed the entire season with a knee injury suffered in a preseason game against the New York Jets. Young described Perkins announcement as [...] "a setback", and said [...] "it slowed <b>us</b> <b>down,</b> interrupted our continuity." [...] Lawrence Taylor however, remained a bright spot, again winning the NFL Defensive Player of the Year award.|$|E
500|$|... "Letters That Cross in the Mail" [...] was {{the first}} song {{recorded}} for the album. Streisand claimed that the inspiration behind the track was simple: it is [...] "about love and the postal service". Santopietro wrote that Holmes' love for of [...] "big band sound" [...] and [...] "a full symphonic orchestra" [...] {{is evident in the}} production. Following her cover of [...] "All in Love Is Fair" [...] in 1974, seventh track [...] "You and I" [...] is Streisand's second cover of a Stevie Wonder song. Taken from his 1972 studio album Talking Book, she called the pop song [...] "immediately [...] touch" [...] and considered Wonder [...] "brilliant" [...] for his work on it. Written by Howard Dietz and Ralph Rainger, Streisand's cover of Libby Holman's [...] "Moanin' Low" [...] appears as the eighth song. In order to place focus on the lyrics during the song, the production contains [...] "octave leaps" [...] while Streisand [...] "changes timbre frequently and quickly between loud and soft sections and high and low pitches". Ninth track [...] "A Child Is Born" [...] features a simplistic piano arrangement accompanied solely by Streisand's vocals; Columbia Records executive reacted to the track's new genre for the singer, stating, [...] "You could put Barbra in front of a rock band or a symphony orchestra, she would still be Barbra Streisand, not compromising, not uncomfortable". [...] "Widescreen", the album's closing track, was inspired by the singer's love of film; according to author Patrick E. Horrigan, it specifically explains [...] "how the movies, dark and dreamlike, seduce us into believing that life can be fulfilling, then let <b>us</b> <b>down</b> as soon as we return to the light of day". It was also the last of four tracks written by Holmes and has a production consisting of [...] "synthesized electronics".|$|E
