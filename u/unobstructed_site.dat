40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the current study}} is to investigate the performance of anidolic vertical openings under real climatic conditions in Greece. For that purpose, an anidolic ceiling was installed in a scale model and was placed next to a reference model equipped with a conventional facade. The models had identical interior photometric properties and geometry. Both models were placed in an <b>unobstructed</b> <b>site</b> and the indoor daylight levels were recorded on specific points of the working plane. Furthermore, the effect of orientation on the formation of indoor daylight conditions was studied by rotating the models, in order to face different directions. The findings of this experimental analysis, which are thoroughly presented in the current paper, indicate that the particular daylight system offer a great potential for enhancing the daylight conditions in deep, side lit spaces, since it seems to perform efficiently under both overcast and clear skies...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} sensor placement on the performance of a disease-warning system for sooty blotch and flyspeck (SBFS), we measured leaf wetness duration (LWD) at 12 canopy positions in apple trees, then simulated operation of the disease-warning system using LWD measurements from different parts of the canopy. LWD sensors were placed in four trees within one Iowa orchard during two growing seasons, and in one tree in each of four orchards during a single growing season. The LWD measurements revealed substantial heterogeneity among sensor locations. In all data sets, the upper, eastern portion of the canopy had the longest mean daily LWD, and was the first site to form dew and the last to dry. The lower, western portion of the canopy averaged about 3 It less LWD per day than the top of the canopy, and was the last zone where dew formed and the first to dry off. On about 25 % of nights when dew occurred {{in the top of the}} canopy, no dew formed in the lower, western canopy. Intracanopy variability of LWD was more pronounced when dew was the sole source of wetness than on days when rainfall occurred. Daily LWD in the upper, eastern portion of the canopy was slightly less than reference measurements made at a 0. 7 -m height over turfgrass located near the orchard. When LWD measurements from several canopy positions were input to the SBFS warning system, timing of occurrence of a fungicide-spray threshold varied by as much as 30 days among canopy positions. Under Iowa conditions, placement of an LWD sensor at an <b>unobstructed</b> <b>site</b> over turfgrass was a fairly accurate surrogate for the wettest part of the canopy. Therefore, such an extra-canopy LWD sensor might be substituted for a within-canopy sensor to enhance operational reliability of the SBFS warning system...|$|E
40|$|Background: Effective malaria {{vector control}} {{targeting}} indoor host-seeking mosquitoes {{has resulted in}} fewer vectors entering houses {{in many areas of}} sub-Saharan Africa, with the proportion of vectors outdoors becoming more important in the transmission of this disease. This study aimed to develop a gravid trap for the outdoor collection of the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae s. l. based on evaluation and modification of commercially available gravid traps. Methods: Experiments were implemented in an 80 m 2 semi-field system where 200 gravid Anopheles gambiae s. s. were released nightly. The efficacy of the Box, CDC and Frommer updraft gravid traps was compared. The Box gravid trap was tested to determine if the presence of the trap over water and the trap’s sound affected catch size. Mosquitoes approaching the treatment were evaluated using electrocuting nets or detergents added to the water in the trap. Based on the results, a new gravid trap (OviART trap) that provided an open, <b>unobstructed</b> oviposition <b>site</b> was developed and evaluated. Results: Box and CDC gravid traps collected similar numbers (relative rate (RR) 0. 8, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 6 – 1. 2; p = 0. 284), whereas the Frommer trap caught 70 % fewer mosquitoes (RR 0. 3, 95 % CI 0. 2 – 0. 5; p < 0. 001). The number of mosquitoes approaching the Box trap was significantly reduced when the trap was positioned over...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) {{satellites}} and their geometry directly affect {{the quality of}} positioning and derived satellite products. Accordingly, the International GNSS Service (IGS) recommends GNSS antennas to be installed away from natural and man-made surfaces and structures, which may affect the incoming signals through severe multipath or obstructions. Following these recommendations, continuous GNSS (cGNSS) stations are generally located in low multipath environments with minimal signal obstructions. However, some applications require GNSS antennas to be installed at specific locations in order to measure local processes. In support of sea level studies, cGNSS stations are established at or close to tide gauges in order to accurately monitor the local vertical land movements experienced by the sea level sensors. However, the environment at the tide gauge might not be optimal for GNSS observations due to the aforementioned station-specific effects, which may degrade the quality of coordinate solutions. This study investigates the impact of severe signal obstructions on long-term position time series for some selected stations. A masking profile from an actually obstructed site is extracted, simulated and applied to <b>unobstructed</b> IGS <b>sites.</b> To investigate these effects, we imple- mented a new feature called azimuth-dependent elevation masking in the Bernese GNSS Software version 5. 2. We present our preliminary results on the use of this new feature to study the impact of different obstruction scenarios on long-term GNSS position time series and vertical land movement estimates. The results show that a certain obstruction, with the effect being highly dependent on its severity and azimuthal direction, affects all coordinate components with the effect being more significant for the Up component. Moreover, it causes changes in the rate estimates and increases the rate uncertainty with the effect being site-specific...|$|R

Gambiae s. s. females were visually deterred by the presence of the trapping device directly over the oviposition medium.
