40|$|User {{involvement}} in emerging technological fields is carried by so-called demand articulation processes. These demand articulation processes are interactive learning processes in which stakeholders try to address {{what they perceive}} as important characteristics of, and to unravel preferences for an emerging innovation. The focus lies on intermediary <b>user</b> <b>organisations,</b> i. e. organised stakeholders that facilitate interactions between users and one or more other actors. In the thesis the following research question is answered: How to understand the demand articulation processes of intermediary <b>user</b> <b>organisations</b> in the context of emerging pharmaceutical technologies? Demand articulation processes are studied in the context of three intermediary <b>user</b> <b>organisations</b> using the ‘event history analysis’. The three Dutch organisations, which are dealing with emerging pharmaceutical innovations are: the Steering committee on orphan drugs, the Breast cancer association, and the Neuromuscular disease association. For the three studied intermediary <b>user</b> <b>organisations</b> it is found that demand articulation processes inside intermediaries can be regarded as an interconnected ensemble of first-order and second-order learning loops. Differences in characterisation of these loops related to distinct contexts and organisations lead to the identification of several specific demand articulation mechanisms, such as ‘management of expectations’, ‘network building’ and ‘active case building’. The intermediary <b>user</b> <b>organisations</b> apply different kinds of interface strategies towards the actors they represent and other relevant parties. The represented actors, subdivided in the ‘silent majority’ and the ‘patient champions’ merit from the representation of them without interaction to quick, passionate calls for action (‘sudden anxiety’) and strategies focusing on longer-term commitment. Concerning interactions with other relevant parties, interface strategies range from asked advocacy in the form of consultative presentation to unasked advocacy, and from forceful to tentative strategies. These strategies were most of the time not the result of ad hoc actions but had a proactive and long-term focus. The analysis showed that intermediaries tried to shape emerging technologies {{in such a way that}} the resulting innovations meet the needs and wishes of the users they represent. The identified demand articulation mechanisms and interface strategies illustrate the way in which they attempt to achieve this. Moreover, these organisations are faced with three dilemmas: 1) Positioning: the confrontation of intermediary’s self-position and the position other actors assign to them reveals possible problems with the neutrality of intermediaries. 2) Representation: for intermediaries it is essential to speak on behalf of their members and picture their demands in a representative way. In this way it can enhance the democratic value of the organisations’ decision-making and input in debates. 3) The need to be proactive: in this way, intermediaries can better anticipate the course of the debate. Moreover, by creating a vision of future technologies in an early phase empowers the intermediary. These three dilemmas show that intermediary <b>user</b> <b>organisations</b> play a precarious role in demand articulation in the context of emerging technologies. However, if these dilemmas can be overcome, these organisations could and will play a central and crucial role in (democratically) governing future oriented technology analysis...|$|R

40|$|In {{the early}} stages of the {{building}} design process not only building and site but also user activities and experiences are formed. This paper presents a development programme for CAAD where conceptual models of some fundamental characteristics of building, site and <b>user</b> <b>organisation</b> will be developed and implemented in a prototype CAAD-programme. The models are based both on empirical studies and an ontological Framework which is also used for organising the basic object structure of the prototype CAD program. The architectural design process has several characteristics which a CAAD-programme must support, e. g incremental determination of properties, change of scale and shift of focus. The research investigates how the design object and the user interface can be formed to serve this working method. One important field is to study the usefulness of the <b>user</b> <b>organisation</b> model for the brief and building management stages. The programming work for the prototypes is done with Smalltalk on Macintosh computers. The tests of the prototype includes spatial co-ordination of the three systems...|$|E

It yields characteristic learning mechanisms, e. g. concerning the management of expectations or actively building a case. If intermediaries overcome challenges regarding positioning, representation and the level of proactivity, they can play a precarious role in demand articulation in the context of new technologies. <b>User</b> involvement Intermediary <b>organisations</b> Demand articulation Emerging technology...|$|R

50|$|In {{response}} {{to the emergence of}} HIV/AIDS in the mid-1980s, Australian drug users began toself-organize into community, peer-driven state and national drug userorganisations. The aim of these organisations was to give voice to the experiences of Australian drug users and to advocate for drug-related policy reform, the provision of harm reduction prophylactics, the expansion of opioid substitution programs, to highlight the health issues affecting illicit drug users and to reduce the stigma and discrimination many illicit drug users experience. Drug <b>user</b> <b>organisations</b> have been recognized by state and federal governments as an effective strategy to educate illicit drug users in relation to techniques for avoiding blood-borne virus transmission, responding to drug overdose, safer injecting techniques, safer sex and legal issues. Australian drug <b>user</b> <b>organisations</b> use a peer education and community development approach to health promotion, with the aim of empowering illicit drug users by providing them with the skills they need to effect change in their own communities.|$|R
40|$|Software {{requirements}} engineering {{can be considered}} as the process by which the features of software systems as perceived by the user are established. Software systems are destined to be embedded into organisational settings, which impose constraints on performance and operational characteristics. Determining how the software should behave within those constraints requires a thorough understanding of the software functionalities, its attributes, the complexity of the interaction between them, and its interaction with the user environment. The primary source of information is the <b>user</b> (<b>organisation).</b> However it is often the case that users inadequately elicit software requirements and in a form inappropriate to the software developers. Software requirements have to be established by an iterative refinement process of elicitation, analysis, modelling and representation. An important but intractable issue is that of knowledge representation and management, and specially domain knowledge. [...] ...|$|E
