5|$|In {{the fourth}} inning, the Indians {{opened up the}} game. Boudreau and Joe Gordon hit {{back-to-back}} singles, which brought Keltner to the plate. The Red Sox expected a bunt, but instead the third baseman hit his 31st home run of the season to put the Indians ahead, 4–1. Galehouse was then replaced with Ellis Kinder, who was met with a double by Larry Doby. Kinder responded by getting the next three batters out, which brought the score to 5–1 as Doby also scored. After Bearden got three Red Sox out, the Indians started the fifth inning with {{the top of their}} lineup. Mitchell and Eddie Robinson, who came in for Clark, were out.

Bob Meusel was then walked, but was tagged out at home after attempting to score on a Lou Gehrig single. The Cardinals came {{into the bottom of}} the first with two straight singles to put runners at first and third base. Rogers Hornsby singled in Taylor Douthit to tie the game at 1–1 and moved Billy Southworth to second base. Jim Bottomley flied out to left field, and Les Bell followed with a sacrifice fly to center fielder Combs. With the go-ahead run at third base, Hornsby stole second, but Chick Hafey struck out to end to the Cardinals' run-scoring threat. Two innings later, Ruth came <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> with two outs and hit Rhem's pitch for a solo home run, his second of the game. Gehrig led off the next inning with a strikeout. Tony Lazzeri followed with a walk, and Joe Dugan hit a run-scoring double. Catcher Hank Severeid hit a single into center field, and Dugan ran towards home. He was tagged out at the plate by catcher Bob O'Farrell. The Yankees' starter Hoyt struck out to end the inning.|$|E

However, around 2:00 pm the skies cleared up and the ground was fit to play when the teams took the field for warmups shortly before 3:00 pm.

Then got Craig Biggio to hit a sharp grounder to third baseman Scott Cooper at third. However, Cooper double clutched ever so slightly and the AL just missed turning the double play on Biggio. This allowed Fregosi to pinch-hit slugger Fred McGriff, who he had saved <b>up,</b> <b>to</b> come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> as <b>the</b> tying run.

50|$|An {{interplate}} earthquake is {{an earthquake}} that {{occurs at the}} boundary between two tectonic plates. Earthquakes of this type {{account for more than}} 90 percent of the total seismic energy released around the world.

Relative plate motion can be lateral as along a transform fault boundary or vertical if along a convergent subduction boundary or a rift at a divergent boundary. At a subduction boundary the motion is due to one <b>plate</b> slipping beneath <b>the</b> other <b>plate</b> resulting in an interplate thrust or megathrust earthquake, which are the most powerful earthquakes.|$|R
