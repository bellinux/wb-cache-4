While statewide standards reduce the educational inequality between privileged and <b>underprivileged</b> <b>districts</b> in a state, they still impose a [...] "one size fits all" [...] standard on individual students. Particularly in states with high standards, schools can be punished {{for not being able}} to dramatically raise the achievement of students that may have below-average capabilities.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{introduces}} {{the idea of}} generalising a cumulative frequency curve to show arbitrary cumulative counts. For example, in demographic studies generalised cumulative curves can represent the distribution of population or area. Generalised cumulative curves can be a valuable instrument for exploratory data analysis. The use of cumulative curves in an investigation of population statistics in Northwest England allowed us to discover interesting facts about relationships between the distribution of national minorities {{and the degree of}} deprivation. We detected that, while high concentration of national minorities occurs, in general, in <b>underprivileged</b> <b>districts,</b> there are some differences related to the origin of the minorities. The paper sets the applicability conditions for generalised cumulative curves and compares them with other graphical tools for exploratory data analysis...|$|E

Prakash and his wife Mandakini run a school and a hospital at Hemalkasa village in the <b>underprivileged</b> <b>district</b> of Gadchiroli in Maharashtra among the Madia Gond tribe, as well as an orphanage for injured wild animals, including a lion and some leopards. She left her governmental medical job and moved to Hemalkasa to start the projects after they married. Their two sons, Dr. Digant and Aniket also dedicated their lives to the same causes. In 2008, Prakash and Mandakini received the Magsaysay Award for Community Leadership.|$|R
40|$|The {{voluntary}} based sports {{movement has}} {{for over a}} hundred years been supported by state funds and seen as {{an important part of the}} Swedish society. In the city of Linköping the ethnical and economical segregation has been increasing in recent years and the consequences are reflected in the local sports associations. In Skäggetorp, statistically the most <b>underprivileged</b> <b>district</b> in city, there is no longer any football association offering activities to children under fourteen years old, either boys or girls. Furthermore, girls with immigrant background are generally less involved in the sports movements and efforts are made from both public authorities and other actors to incite activity. This essay analyses the political rationality lying behind the planned and realized interventions and how the actors have been experiencing the processes of cooperation. The empirical material has been collected by interviews with the involved actors. The theoretical framework has been constituted by a theory of construction of problem representation along with theoretical concepts as capital and governance. Main findings consist of a difference of rationality depending on whether the activity is aimed at boys or girls or if it is conducted within the structure of sports associations. Also, associations in <b>underprivileged</b> urban <b>districts</b> are both seen as possible promotors for social change and as subjects in need of help. The system of public allowances for sports associations can only be distributed to projects even though all actors are addressing a long-term approach. This study also shows the challenges that exists within the decentralisation of public administration, governance and cooperation by different actors...|$|R

40|$|Despite being a {{metropolitan}} city and Asian financial hub, Hong Kong has the widest income inequality among all developed economies. Students {{in the lower}} social class were confined to limited learning resources, such as access to quality school utilities and monetary-based learning programmes. Hence, peer mentoring {{could serve as a}} form of low-cost intervention implemented in schools in <b>underprivileged</b> <b>district</b> to provide learning opportunities for students beyond regular school lessons. This dissertation aims to explore and fill the literature gap of an unexplored field on how child mentors perceive their development in a peer-mentoring programme, in an underprivileged context of Hong Kong. Therefore, this study was conducted at a Hong Kong primary school, from a lower-socioeconmomic district. 15 mentors and 15 mentees were selected from the same school, and were invited to participate in a peer reading programme, over the course of 6 weeks, in a total of 12 sessions. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected from the mentors. The qualitative instrument collected pre-mentoring and post-mentoring findings, while the quantitative instrument collected on-going data over the 6 -week programme. The findings revealed that these child mentors have perceived overall positive development. Connectedness between the mentors and mentees were found to be the crucial component contributing to the development of mentors. Durational factors such as prolonged isolation were sighted as detrimental factors to mentors’ development. published_or_final_versionEducationBachelorBachelor of Education in Language Educatio...|$|R
40|$|Using {{the case}} of a {{four-year}} ethnography of a tenants’ association in an <b>underprivileged</b> <b>district</b> of Montréal, Québec, Canada, I show how workers use artefacts to translate the built landscape – the physical characteristics and issues of buildings – into language. This translation, I contend, is necessary to ground the association’s calls to city officials for intervention as legitimate and necessary. In turn, those calls, as they are recirculated, open up or deter programs of action. In other words, action is transformed into language which in turn calls for further action – and the distinction between action and language fades. This is not only a theoretical stance but also a preoccupation of participants themselves, whose daily work consists of effacing their own intervention and of presenting their calls for repairs as genuine demands from the district’s built landscape itself. This is especially important in a district where gentrification and other physical changes have a growing impact on poorer citizens. As researchers, we need {{to keep in mind that}} pitting materiality against language, or action against its descriptions, is unproductive from a pragmatic point of view and fails to account for the way in which community workers – among others – work and attempt, discursively, to shape their environment while presenting that environment as speaking “by itself. ...|$|R
40|$|Preliminary This paper uses general {{equilibrium}} simulations {{to explore}} the role ofresidential mobility in shaping the impact {{of different types of}} private school voucher policies. In particular, general vouchers available to all residents in the state are compared to vouchers specifically targeted to either <b>underprivileged</b> school <b>districts</b> or <b>underprivileged</b> households. The simulations are derived from a three-community mo deI of low, middle and high income school districts (calibrated to New York data), where each school district is composed of multiple types of neighborhoods that may vary in house quality as well as the leveI of neighborhood extemalities. Households that differ in both their income and in the ability leveI of their children choose between school districts, between neighborhoods within their school district, and between the local public school or a menu of private school altematives. Local public school quality within a district is endogenously determined bya combination of the average peer quality of public school attending children as well as local property and state income tax supported spending. Financial support (above a required state minimum) is set by local majority rule. Finally, there exists the potential for a private school market composed o...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the elements of successful outcomes among disadvantaged members of the South Florida immigrant communities and assesses the utility of rational choice theory and the Wisconsin model. The findings are derived from ethnographic interviews and analysis {{of two of the}} most <b>underprivileged</b> South Florida <b>districts,</b> Little Haiti and Hialeah. The article builds upon the elements of success as identified in the lead article of this volume, which include items relevant to the family, the individual, and the broader commu-nity context. The authors add the following to those success factors: (1) ignorance (or disregard) of the bar-riers to success and the odds against overcoming them; (2) emotionally motivated responses to the surrounding social conditions or to specific (cathartic) events; and (3) exiting underprivileged neighborhoods of origin to facilitate access to resources, mainly educational...|$|R

In tbis model, it is demonstrated that school district targeted vouchers are similar in their impact to non-targeted vouchers but vastIy different from vouchers targeted to low income households.

The Askeskin at present, and Jamkesmas program is expected to serve the underprivileged entirely, therefore they are ensured to access the free of charge health service, but the reality demonstrate the opposite, the program {{is not able to}} provide health service for the underprivileged in Indonesia yet. Health service is created to obtain a better health level of the society. A decent level of health would increase productivity, quality of life and human development index as well as reducing poverty. The purposes of the research were as to analyze the influence of health service for the underprivileged to the health level in Medan, to analyze the influence of human development to poverty and to analyze the influence of poverty to the ability to access health service in Medan. This research is an explanatory research, using linear regression for analysis method, the research is held in Medan, where the object is people categorized <b>underprivileged</b> in 21 <b>districts.</b> The outcome explains that the health service provide a significant influence to the health level. If there is an increasing quality of health service to the underprivileged, it will increase health level for the underprivileged.
