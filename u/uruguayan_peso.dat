Namely, property prices in Punta del Este, Uruguay, are predominantly in the US dollars, while property development costs are partially in the <b>Uruguayan</b> <b>pesos</b> and partially in the US dollars. In general, the costs are mainly due to land, design and development, materials, labor costs and subcontracts. Those {{that are in the}} <b>Uruguayan</b> <b>pesos</b> are labor costs (i.e., salaries of Uruguayan workers) and they can, for example, be around 30 % of the structure’s costs, that is, of the total cost minus the land cost. Therefore, we can say that, for some ν∈(0, 1), the percentage ν 100 % of the total cost is in the <b>Uruguayan</b> <b>pesos</b> and the rest (1 −ν) 100 % is in the US dollars.|$|R

50|$|The {{collective}} ruling {{council was}} unable to agree on harsh measures that were required to stabilize the economy. As the demand for Uruguay’s export products plummeted, the collective leadership tried to avoid budget cuts by spending Uruguay’s currency reserves and then began taking foreign loans. <b>Uruguayan</b> <b>peso</b> was devaluated, inflation reached 60% and economy was in deep crisis.|$|E

Half of the building was intended for the reactor, manufactured by Lockheed Nuclear Products of Marietta (Georgia), purchased with a state investment of two million <b>Uruguayan</b> <b>pesos</b> of that time, including installation costs. Subsequently, Uruguay invested 20 million <b>Uruguayan</b> <b>pesos</b> from the government budget to construct the building and put it into operation. Law 13640, article 259 established that the reactor was the property of Uruguayan government and remained under the purview of the National Atomic Energy Commission.|$|R
50|$|Uruguay, while a {{beneficiary}} of IMF intervention, {{has not gone}} under any substantial macroeconomic changes mandated by the IMF. No projects have been enacted in the Latin American state, however, multiple arrangements have been made for the IMF to provide the country with varying amounts of stand-by credit (funds {{to be used as}} a last resort in the event of due payment to a third party by Uruguay), the first of which was arranged in 1996. This is in line with the institution's goal of achieving and supporting economic stability. These standby credit lines started during a time of significant economic growth (5% year-over-year), but also at a time of heavy dollarization (alignment with/dependency on the U.S. Dollar). For context, as of 2008, 60% of bank loans use U.S. Dollars as opposed to the national currency, the <b>Uruguayan</b> <b>peso.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{economy of}} Uruguay is {{characterized}} by an export-oriented agricultural sector and a well-educated work force, along {{with high levels of}} social spending. After averaging growth of 5% annually during 1996-98, in 1999-2002 the economy suffered a major downturn, stemming largely from the spillover effects of the economic problems of its large neighbors, Argentina and Brazil. In 2001-02, Argentine citizens made massive withdrawals of dollars deposited in Uruguayan banks after bank deposits in Argentina were frozen, which led to a plunge in the <b>Uruguayan</b> <b>peso,</b> a banking crisis, and a sharp economic contraction. Real GDP fell in four years by nearly 20%, with 2002 the worst year. The unemployment rate rose, inflation surged, and the burden of external debt doubled. Financial assistance from the IMF helped stem the damage. Uruguay restructured its external debt in 2003 without asking creditors to accept a reduction on the principal. Economic growth for Uruguay resumed, and averaged 8% annually during the period 2004-08. The 2008-09 global financial crisis put a brake on Uruguay's vigorous growth, which decelerated to 2.9% in 2009. Nevertheless, the country managed to avoid a recession and keep positive growth rates, mainly through higher public expenditure and investment, and GDP growth exceeded 7% in 2010.|$|E

50|$|The {{energy crisis}} in Uruguay in 2007 led to Uruguay reopening the nuclear debate under the {{presidency}} of Tabaré Vázquez, when the Executive Branch established a multiparty committee devoted {{to the study of}} the use of nuclear energy to generate electricity and the installation of a nuclear power plant. The Fukushima accident stimulated the discussions of different scopes, especially political and social. In July 2011 the government announced that Uruguay was soon to enter Phase 1 of an evaluation of nuclear energy, providing 10 million <b>Uruguayan</b> <b>pesos</b> from the national budget to hire specialist advisers, consulting the population and reviewing the human resources and technology available.|$|R

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the exchange rate}} based stabilization applied in Uruguay during the 1990 s. A crawling peg with a low rate of depreciation was the economic tool chosen by three successive administrations to reduce inflation by using the exchange rate as the main nominal anchor. This process was uniquely complex, as the country experienced in the same years an important trade liberalization following the firm of MERCOSUR treatise. Inflation was reduced gradually and the policy resulted in continuous and significant real appreciation of the <b>uruguayan</b> <b>peso</b> ("atraso cambiario") which determined great problems in external balance that ended in a big financial crash in 2002. This paper {{analyzes the}} intertemporal problems associated with this policy through personal interviews with leading economic officials {{of the time and}} examines the public positioning assumed by politicians, businessmen and trade unionists of those years. ...|$|E
40|$|Using {{a dynamic}} {{stochastic}} {{general equilibrium model}} with financial frictions, this paper evaluates {{the effects of a}} rule that incorporates not only the interest rate but also the legal reserve requirements as instruments of monetary policy. It is found that reserve requirements can be used to achieve the Central Bank's inflation objectives. The use of this instrument, however, produces a real appreciation of the <b>Uruguayan</b> <b>peso.</b> When the Central Bank uses the monetary policy rate as an instrument, the effect of an increase in reserve requirements is to contribute to reducing the negative impact on consumption, investment and output. Nevertheless, the quantitative results in terms of inflation reduction are rather poor. The policy rate becomes more effective in reducing inflation when the reserve requirement instrument is solely directed at achieving financial stability. The paper's main policy conclusion is that a well-targeted non-conventional policy instrument can help to effectively control inflation. ...|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} of trends in {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI) in Uruguay is difficult due to data problems. Nevertheless, balance-of-payments data reveal that inward FDI (IFDI) increased sharply {{in the second half}} of the decade 2002 - 2011 under analysis. IFDI flows relative to GDP rose annually on average to close to 6 % in 2005 - 2011. This compares favorably with annual average flows of only 1 % in the decade before the banking crisis and the sharp devaluation of the <b>Uruguayan</b> <b>peso</b> in 2002. At the time, investment in natural resources, including in farmland and real estate in Punta del Este, became very attractive. IFDI flows peaked at 7. 5 % of GDP in 2006, with the investment in the construction of the first cellulose plant in the country by a multinational enterprise (MNE) from Finland. The rapid increase in IFDI {{in the second half of}} the past decade took place amid high rates of economic growth (averaging about 6 % a year on average), in combination with an adequate policy and regulatory framework and fiscal incentives to foreign investors. So far, Uruguay remains primarily a host country for FDI, with outward FDI (OFDI) that has been and continues to be insignificant...|$|E
30|$|In Punta del Este, {{a resort}} town in Uruguay, {{real-estate}} property is in demand by {{both domestic and}} foreign buyers. As a recent example, the frequency distribution of buyers for certain high-rise buildings was approximately as follows: 75 % Argentineans, 10 % Uruguayans, 9 % Brazilians, and the remaining ones {{from the rest of}} the world (Chile, U.S.A., and so on). A few immediate observations follow. First, the ratio of domestic and foreign buyers varies depending on a number of factors, including economic, financial, and political. Second, it has been observed that the average foreign buyer is wealthier than the average domestic one, and thus tends to exhibit higher bidding prices. Furthermore, given the diversity of buyers, the prices are usually in the US dollars (USD), but some of the building costs such as salaries of workers are in the <b>Uruguayan</b> <b>pesos</b> (UYU).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a stable common currency for mid-sized open monetary economies with incomplete markets {{in general and}} the Mercosur countries in particular. The proposed currency is constructed as a derivative of a dynamic portfolio of securities that proxies the nominal exchange risk factors for a set of monies and floats against the rest of the world’s currencies. We find that the resulting optimal common currency is comprised of currencies with country weights that are statistically significant and fairly symmetrical with relatively equal weight (e. g., 22 % Argentinean pesos, 27 % Brazilian reals, 27 % Chilean pesos, and 23 % <b>Uruguayan</b> <b>pesos).</b> We also find that increasing the number of countries in a common currency tends to increase its stability. The willingness of Mercosur countries to participate in a monetary union is assessed from statistical moments of the density functions of the implied stable common currency and its components. stable common currency, open monetary economies, regime switching models, Mercosur, currency basket...|$|R
