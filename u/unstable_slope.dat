2500|$|Emgesa has {{committed}} to buying [...] of [...] land for 17,000 million pesos to connect two forest reserves {{in the area of}} influence (Reserva Forestal de la Amazonía y la Reserva Forestal Central). There are also plans to build a viaduct over the reservoir that will connect the municipalities of Garzón and El Agrado. The decision to build this major dam as a concrete faced rockfill dam was decided after studying several types of dams for the prevailing site conditions. The site conditions, which dictated the choice of the dam, are the narrow gorge of the river and the geological formation of highly friable sandstones at the dam site. The project area is subject to earthquakes and seismic factors have been accounted for {{in the design of the}} dam and appurtenant works. Nine earthquakes were experienced in Columbia between 1762 and 1994 with the earthquake event of 2 February 1736 with magnitude of 6.3 on Richter scale to last one on 6 June 1994 of magnitude 6.6 with epicentre of 73km distance of the project site, which caused severe damage and fatalities. Twenty-three active <b>unstable</b> <b>slope</b> areas, with two potentially unstable land slides (mud slides) are also noted in the project area.|$|E
60|$|How tightly {{these white}} sepulchres are packed here! How {{different}} this congestion of sorrow from the mossy latitude of God's Acre in the country! The dead are crammed together {{as closely as}} the living seemed in that bird's-eye view from the Archway. There is no ample shadow of trees, no tangled corners where mother earth may weave flower garlands over her returning children. The monuments positively jostle and elbow each other for frontage upon the footways. And they are so rawly clean and assertive. Most of them are conspicuously new whitened, with freshly-blackened or newly-gilt inscriptions, bare of lichen, moss, or mystery, and altogether so restless {{that it seems to}} the meditative man that the struggle for existence, for mere standing room and a show in the world, still rages among the dead. The <b>unstable</b> <b>slope</b> of the hill, with its bristling array of obelisks, crosses and urns, craning one above another, is as directly opposed to the restfulness of the village churchyard with its serene outspreading yews as midday Fleet Street to a Sabbath evening amidst the Sussex hills.

40|$|The flysch areas {{belong to}} the territories with highest {{occurrence}} of landslides in Slovakia. Almost 67 % of all landslides in Slovakia take place within the Carpathian flysch. It {{is a type of}} slope deformation that responds sensitively to the quality of individual factors that form the landscape and to the change in natural conditions. The occurrence of various geodynamic phenomena can be understood as a geological barrier that reduces or inhibits the use of natural environment and negatively affects the life of society and territorial development. In this paper, we evaluate the statistical significance of selected natural factors of the landscape in relation to the occurrence of <b>unstable</b> <b>slopes</b> in the Kysuce region. In addition, we also evaluated the expansion of <b>unstable</b> <b>slopes</b> in individual landscape factors. Significant linkages between the variables’ hydrogeological base_sandstones with thin clay layers (HB_s) and geological-substrate complex_loamy wastes to loamy-stony debris on sandy conglomerates (GSC_sc) (R = 0. 95, p = 0. 002) and secondary significant linkages between the variables soil type: Dystric Cambisols (S_CMd) and HB_s (R = 0. 40, p = 0. 002) (Klokočov and Zákopčie cadastres) were observed. Significant correlation of variables within the areas with <b>unstable</b> <b>slopes</b> was also observed between hydrogeological base_sandy flysch (HB_sf) and geological-substrate complex_loamy wastes on flysch stones (GSC_fs) (R = 0. 81, p = 0. 002) (Nová Bystrica and Kysucké Nové Mesto cadastres). The most <b>unstable</b> <b>slopes</b> occur in Nová Bystrica cadastre (34. 62 % of the area) and in the Klokočov cadastre (28. 25 % of the area). The inclination of slopes (especially slopes above 12 °) plays an important role within the <b>unstable</b> <b>slopes.</b> Slopes with steep inclination cover up to 81. 45 % of the cadastral area of Nová Bystrica, of which almost 1 / 3 are <b>unstable</b> <b>slopes...</b>|$|R

On June 22, construction began on a project to install a new traffic signal at the SR 155 intersection in Okanogan, two variable-message signs and two traffic cameras near the Canada-US border.

50|$|The area {{in which}} the tracks appear is an eroded layer of rock {{covering}} about 2,000 m², tilted at an angle of about 45°, in a forest {{on the side of the}} volcano. The footprints consist of three sets of tracks which descend a steep slope created by a pyroclastic flow. The first, identified as Trackway A, measures 13.4 m and consists of 27 prints from left and right feet descending 4.26 m vertically along a Z-shaped course. It testifies to a careful descent down a steep and probably <b>unstable</b> <b>slope.</b> Trackway B is 8.6 m long and descends 2.91 m vertically along a single curved route. Less care was taken with this part of the descent, as slips and irregularities indicating stumbles are visible. Finally, the less well-preserved Trackway C measures 9.98 m along a single straight line which descends 2.56 m vertically. Occasional handprints are visible where the track-maker sought support on the steep slope, and a couple of animal pawmarks made by a big dog or wolf are also visible.|$|E

50|$|In late Cretaceous time, Central Texas {{was part}} of a vast marine shelf on which {{carbonate}} rocks were deposited with the entire area gradually subsiding as sediments were laid down. The volcano formed when magma worked its way to the surface and encountered water-laden, unconsolidated sediments with the existing water rapidly vaporizing into steam resulting in an enormous explosion that formed an explosion crater. Explosive eruptions continued at Pilot Knob as new magma encountered more water in the volcanic ash. Gradually, an ash cone was built up over the explosion crater. Eruptions of ash continued until the mound grew above the level of the shallow sea. Ash beds, now altered to clay, occur interbedded with limestone and marl of the Austin Group around Pilot Knob; these ash beds provide evidence for subaerial eruptions at Pilot Knob. The Pilot Knob ash cone eventually built an <b>unstable</b> <b>slope</b> on the sea bottom, resulting in mud flows of ash and carbonate mud which tore up the underlying carbonate mud in places and injected itself into the carbonate mud at other places. The subaerial Pilot Knob ash cone allowed the intrusion of magma into the mound without contact with sea water, resulting in quieter lava eruptions. Such magma cooled and solidified to form the core and satellite areas of the trap rock. Some of the trap rock bodies are the erosional remnants of lava flows, due to their apparent dip away from the central core area. Cooling joints exposed on a hill about 1,500 ft west of Pilot Knob suggest a dip of that trap rock body towards the center of the core area, possibly indicating that it is the erosional remnant of a cone sheet injected outwards from a central, discordant intrusive body of magma. Exposures at other bodies of trap rock are not generally good enough to determine their exact emplacement, but some, at least, are probably plugs of solidified intrusive magma. Magnetic anomalies on the northeast flank of the core area suggest a buried trap rock body within the ash mound, possibly a cone sheet or lava flow.|$|E
