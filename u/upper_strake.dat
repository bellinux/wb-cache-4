50|$|The Bevaix {{boat was}} built from large oak planks and {{measured}} 19.40 m {{in length and}} around 2.90 m in beam. It {{is characterized by a}} flat bottom and the complete absence of a keel or any central plank. Its four principle bottom planks were arranged one besides the other {{in a way that the}} first plank forms the stern and the last one forms the bow. The beam of the boat was determined by the addition of L-shaped bilge strakes. These strakes allowed a direct transition between the flat bottom and the sides of the boat. The spaces left between the bilge strakes and the four large bottom planks were filled by two planks with an irregular outline. The purpose of these last planks was to obtain appropriate symmetry of the bottom. The <b>upper</b> <b>strakes,</b> those above the bilge strake, did not survive. However, evidence of caulking, found on the upper edges of the bilge strakes clearly suggests that the sides had been heightened by at least one or two strakes. This, in turn, led to estimates suggesting that the maximum height of the boat was about 0.80 to 0.90 m.|$|R

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} {{for the design}} of a strake for a forebody typical of supersonic aircraft at typical cruise (low lift) conditions, in order to ensure attached flow on the <b>strake</b> <b>upper</b> surface.
