In {{his movies}} {{he managed to}} catch life's most {{beautiful}} colors, <b>unhide</b> the poetry behind the ordinary and to be {{ahead of his time}} without forgetting his roots. “In Jakubisko films the irrational, mysterious and sensational seems to be as natural as the life itself, although not all of us are able to have Jakubisko ́s eye, enabled to see that mysterious, unexpected and fantastic even in simple ordinary daily life“ - Federico Fellini. Thanks to his typical handwriting, full of allegory, fantasy and visionary imagination, about Jakubisko is written as about an artist, who with his magical realism {{in this part of the}} world means in the film the same, what Gabriel García Márquez in the literature of the Latin America. Juraj Jakubisko attracts the international attention thanks to his experimental films.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} the Indented Pixel Tree Browser—an interactive tool for exploring, annotating, and comparing huge hierarchical structures on {{different levels of}} granularity. We exploit the indented visual metaphor to map tree structures to one-dimensional zigzag curves to primarily achieve an overview representation for the entire hierarchy. We focus on space-efficiency and simultaneous uncovering of tree-specific phenomena. Each displayed plot can be filtered for substructures that are mapped to a larger space and hence, <b>unhide</b> more finegranular substructures that are hidden in the compressed overview. By representing tree structures side-by-side, the viewer can easily compare them visually and detect similar patterns and also anomalies. In our approach, we follow the information seeking mantra: overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand. More interactive features such as expanding and collapsing of nodes, applying different color codings, or distorting the tree horizontally as well as vertically support a viewer when exploring huge hierarchical data sets. The usefulness of our interactive browsing tool is demonstrated in a case study for the NCBI taxonomy that contains 324, 276 species and organisms that are hierarchically organized. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{construct}} explicit Lagrangian formulation for the massive spin- 2 supermultiplets with N = k supersymmetries k = 1, 2, 3, 4. Such multiplets contain 2 k particles with spin- 3 / 2, so there must exist N = 2 k local supersymmetries {{in the full}} nonlinear theories spontaneously broken so that only N = k global supersymmetries remain unbroken. In this paper we <b>unhide</b> these hidden supersymmetries by using gauge invariant formulation for massive high spin particles. Such formulation, operating with the right set of physical degrees of freedom {{from the very beginning}} and having non- singular massless limit, turns out to be very well suited for construction of massive supermultiplets from the well known massless ones. For all four cases considered we have managed to show that the massless limit of the supertransformations for N = k massive supermultiplet could be uplifted to N = 2 k supersymmetry. This, in turn, allows one to investigate which extended supergravity models such massive multiplets could arise from. Our results show a clear connection of possible models with the five-dimensional extended supergravities...|$|E

Therefore Security and secrecy are important aspects required in the exchange of information or messages over the network / internet. Steganography {{is one of the most}} powerful techniques to conceal the existence of hidden secret data inside an image. The simplest approach to hiding data within an image file is called least significant bit (LSB) insertion. In this method, we can take the binary representation of the hidden data and overwrite the least significant bit of each byte within the image. If we are using 24 -bit color, the amount of change will be minimal and indiscernible to the human eye.

40|$|To remain {{competitive}} and to boost profitability, manufacturers in capital-intensive and highly competitive industries want to maximize throughput and minimize flow time. Achieving high throughput conflicts with achieving low flow time. In order to <b>unhide</b> the tradeoff between throughput and flow time, a performance measure, called manufacturing performance, has been developed. The manufacturing performance {{is defined by}} the quotient of the ratio between throughput and flow time of an actual manufacturing system and this ratio of a reference system. The reference system can be adapted by the user in correspondence with objectives. By applying the manufacturing performance to one workstation and using analytic approximations for this workstation, manufacturing performance can be expressed analytically. It seems that manufacturing performance has an optimal value that is given by equipment availability and coefficient of variation. Manufacturing performance is applied also to a four-workstation manufacturing line. Results from analytic approximations show the practicability of the manufacturing performance. Comparison of manufacturing performance with overall fab efficiency, an earlier proposed metric, showed that the manufacturing performance is a more clear metric. This conclusion was based upon simulations with a two-stations manufacturing line. The manufacturing performance is a technical performance metric for manufacturing lines that supports, for instance, economical considerations to obtain optimal throughput-flow time combinations under economical optimal results. This is a useful addition to the existing metrics, which may benefit manufacturers in their operations. The authors consider this contribution as a discussion paper and demand for comment...|$|E

Aim: To study socioeconomic correlates of receptive needle and syringe sharing among IDUs in Iran. Methods: The study used data from the <b>Unhide</b> Risk Study, a national survey of IDUs. This study sampled 636 IDUs (91 % male) via snowball sampling from eight provinces in Iran in 2009. Socio-demographic and drug use characteristics were collected. We used a logistic regression to determine factors associated with receptive needle and syringe sharing during the past six months. Results: From 636 IDUs enrolled in this study, 68 % (n= 434) reported receptive needle and syringe sharing behaviors in the past six months. Odds of receptive needle and syringe sharing in the past six months was lower among IDUs who were male (OR= 0. 29, 95 % CI= 0. 12 to 0. 70), had higher education (OR= 0. 74, 95 % CI= 0. 64 to 0. 86) but higher among those who were unemployed (OR= 4. 05, 95 % CI= 1. 50 to 10. 94), and were single (OR= 1. 47, 95 % CI= 1. 02 to 2. 11). Conclusion: This study presented factors associated with risk of receptive needle and syringe sharing among Iranian IDUs. This information may be used for HIV prevention and harm reduction purposes.

Traditional approaches for providing E 2 E security for mHealth systems are based on asymmetric cryptosystems that require extensive security infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a novel protocol, Physiology-based End-to-End Security (PEES), which provides a secure communication channel between the sensors and the back-end medical cloud in a transparent way. PEES uses: (1) physiological signal features to hide a secret key, and (2) synthetically generated physiological signals from generative models parameterized with patient’s physiological information, to <b>unhide</b> the key. Moreover, in PEES authentication comes for free since only sensors on the user’s body has access to physiological features and can therefore gain access to the protected information in the cloud. The analysis of the approach using electrocardiogram (ECG) and phototplethysmogram (PPG) signals and their associated models demonstrate the feasibility of PEES. The protocol is light-weight for sensors and has no pre-deployment or storage requirements and can provide strong and random keys (≈ 90 bits long).

For this reason, Nath et al. developed several information security systems, combining cryptography and steganography together, and the present method, ASA_QR, is also one of them. In the present paper, the authors present a new steganography algorithm to hide any small encrypted secret message inside QR CodeTM, which is then randomized and then, finally embed that randomized QR Code inside some common image. Quick Response Codes (or QR Codes) are a type of two-dimensional matrix barcodes used for encoding information. It has become very popular recently for its high storage capacity. The present method is ASA_QR is a combination of strong encryption algorithm and data hiding in two stages to make the entire process extremely hard to break. Here, the secret message is encrypted first and hide it in a QR CodeTM and then again that QR CodeTM is embed in a cover file (picture file) in random manner, using the standard method of steganography. In this way the data, which is secured, is almost impossible to be retrieved without knowing the cryptography key, steganography password and the exact <b>unhide</b> method.
