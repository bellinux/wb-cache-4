25|$|American {{psychiatrist}} Thomas Szasz {{insisted that}} psychiatric hospitals are like prisons, not proper hospitals, and that psychiatrists who subject others to coercion function as judges and jailers, not physicians. The French historian Michel Foucault is widely {{known for his}} comprehensive critique of the <b>use</b> <b>and</b> <b>abuse</b> of the mental hospital system in Madness and Civilization. He argued that Tuke and Pinel's asylum was a symbolic recreation of the condition of a child under a bourgeois family. It was a microcosm symbolizing the massive structures of bourgeois society and its values: relations of Family–Children (paternal authority), Fault–Punishment (immediate justice), Madness–Disorder (social and moral order).|$|E

In {{conducting}} his business Lucas was struck with certain abuses connected with the sale of drugs, and in 1735 published A Short Scheme for Preventing Frauds and Abuses in Pharmacy, humbly offered to the Consideration of the Legislature. His pamphlet was resented by his fellow-apothecaries, but {{was the cause of}} an act being passed for the inspection of medicines. In 1741 he published his Pharmacomastix, or the Office, <b>Use,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Abuse</b> of Apothecaries Explained, and had the satisfaction of seeing the former act renewed.|$|E

500|$|The art {{historian}} Jacob Isager {{writes in the}} introduction to his analysis of Pliny's chapters on art in the Natural History that his intention is:to show how Pliny in his encyclopedic work – which is the result of adaptations from many earlier writers and according to Pliny himself was intended as a reference work – nevertheless throughout expresses a basic attitude to Man and his relationship with Nature; how he understands Man's role as an inventor ("scientist and artist"); and finally his attitude to the <b>use</b> <b>and</b> <b>abuse</b> of Nature's and Man's creations, to progress and decay. More specifically, Isager writes that [...] "the guiding principle in Pliny's treatment of Greek and Roman art is the function of art in society", while Pliny [...] "uses his art history to express opinions about the ideology of the state".|$|E

500|$|Since airing, [...] "Grift of the Magi" [...] has {{received}} generally mixed to negative reception from critics. While reviewing the eleventh season of The Simpsons, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson {{commented that the}} episode [...] "feels like an amalgamation of elements from prior holiday programs and never really elicits much humor. Christmas is commercialized and corporations <b>use</b> <b>and</b> <b>abuse</b> their customers? Those aren’t exactly rich insights, so [...] {{comes across as a}} below average episode." [...] In his review of the DVD Christmas With the Simpsons, Digitally Obsessed critic Joel Cunningham wrote that the episode [...] "comes from Season 11, well past the point when the series had sacrificed character for absurdist humor. Unless you don't think evil toy marketers, sentient Furbys, and Gary Coleman qualify. Anyway, after the school nearly goes bankrupt, Principal Skinner signs a contract with corporate backers who use the kids to conduct market research. There are some good gags, but the story doesn't hang together very well." [...] Adam Tyner of DVD Talk argued that the episode [...] "has a couple of good gags (Gary Coleman chatting on the phone being my favorite) but is quickly forgettable". Brian James of PopMatters described Coleman's cameo as [...] "hysterical" [...] in 2004, and Meghan Lewit of the same website listed [...] "Grift of the Magi" [...] at number eight on her 2009 list of the [...] "10 best holiday themed TV episodes." ...|$|E
