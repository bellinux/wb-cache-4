In this paper, we concern ourselves with datasets in which the spatial characteristics are relatively static but many dimensions prevail and data is sampled over different time periods. Example applications include building energy management of HVAC <b>unit</b> <b>diagnostics.</b> We present methods employed in our Wakame visualization system to support such tasks as discovering anomalies and comparing performance across multiple time series. Novel methods include animated transitions that relate data in spatially located 3 D views with conventional 2 D graphs.

40|$|Many {{studies have}} shown that energy savings of five to fifteen percent are {{achievable}} in commercial buildings by detecting and correcting building faults, and optimizing building control systems. However, in spite of good progress in developing tools for determining HVAC diagnostics, methods to detect faults in HVAC systems are still generally undeveloped. Most approaches use numerical filtering or parameter estimation methods to compare data from energy meters and building sensors to predictions from mathematical or statistical models. They are effective when models are relatively accurate and data contain few errors. In this paper, we address the case where models are imperfect and data are variable, uncertain, and can contain error. We apply a Bayesian updating approach that is systematic in managing and accounting for most forms of model and data errors. The proposed method uses both knowledge of first principle modeling and empirical results to analyze the system performance within the boundaries defined by practical constraints. We demonstrate the approach by detecting faults in commercial building air handling units. We find that the limitations that exist in air handling <b>unit</b> <b>diagnostics</b> due to practical constraints can generally be effectively addressed through the proposed approach...|$|E

40|$|Our {{results suggest}} that the {{prevalence}} of bone health deficits in children with CP was overestimated, when using only age- and height-adjusted bone mineral content (BMC) and areal bone mineral density (aBMD). When applying the functional muscle-bone <b>unit</b> <b>diagnostic</b> algorithm (FMBU-A), the prevalence of positive results decreased significantly. We recommend applying the FMBU-A when assessing bone health in children with CP. INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of bone health deficits in children with cerebral palsy (CP) might be overestimated because age- and height-adjusted reference percentiles for bone mineral content (BMC) and areal bone mineral density (aBMD) assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) do not consider reduced muscle activity. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the prevalence of positive DXA-based indicators for bone health deficits in children with CP to the prevalence of positive findings after applying a functional muscle-bone <b>unit</b> <b>diagnostic</b> algorithm (FMBU-A) considering reduced muscle activity. METHODS: The present study was a monocentric retrospective analysis of 297 whole body DXA scans of children with CP. The prevalence of positive results of age- and height-adjusted BMC and aBMD defined as BMC and aBMD below the P 3 percentile and of the FMBU-A was calculated. RESULTS: In children with CP, the prevalence of positive results of age-adjusted BMC were 33. 3...|$|R

40|$|<b>Diagnostic</b> <b>units</b> (horizons, {{properties}} and materials) are commonly applied {{in a number}} of international and national classification systems, including WRB, Soil Taxonomy, Hungarian and Irish systems. <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>units</b> can be established in the field, with laboratory analyses or derived from existing soil survey databases. These <b>diagnostic</b> <b>units</b> are designed to support the process of objective soil classification. The soil <b>diagnostic</b> <b>units</b> however carry important information by themselves and can be mapped and provide a better visualisation of the soil -landscape continuum, as and have been demonstrated in different projects (such as the e_SOTER). The LANDMARK project (EU 2020) has applied the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>unit</b> approach to explain five key soil functions evident in agricultural systems; 1) primary productivity, 2) water purification and regulation, 3) carbon storage and regulation, 4) provision of a habitat for biodiversity and 5) cycling of nutrients. Modelling the capacity of a soil to deliver multiple of these soils functions is the main approach of the LANDMARK project, with a focus at farm, regional and European scales. The <b>diagnostic</b> <b>unit</b> classes is one application currently being considered to define the functional behaviour of our soils. This presentation will use the e_SOTER database and maps to provide an example of how the diagnostic approach can be applied.

40|$|Actually, {{there is}} growing {{consensus}} that for many system applications, safety as well as security demands have to be observed in a coherent manner. In this paper we describe such an integrated approach to protect the nodes of distributed co-operative systems against malicious attacks and unplanned system failures. The basic strategy {{is the use of}} special diagnostic agents for that purpose. This agent concept is supported by means of additional <b>diagnostic</b> <b>units</b> modularly added to the processor/memory interface of each node of the system. These units have their own autonomous control which cannot be altered by their corresponding processor. Each instruction transferred to the processor, and each data word transferred to/from the processor, in a side step can be scanned by the diagnosis unit. In case of a suspicion for malicious or non-malicious faults, the diagnosis unit can take over control of the corresponding processor to run diagnostic routines, and can trigger bootstrap or recovery procedures to restore a proper state of the processor of the node. The <b>diagnostic</b> <b>unit</b> also can communicate with the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>units</b> of the other nodes {{about the state of the}} entire system. Thus, after detecting suspicious behaviour in its own node, by alarming the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>units</b> of the other nodes, further spreading of an attack is tried to be hindered. Even in case the attack spreads quicker within the system than the diagnosis can initially assess and confine it, the co-operating <b>diagnostic</b> <b>units</b> remain a functioning distributed hardcore which can start and carry out a recovery of the system. The resulting impact on system reliability is derived; here also a modelling approach is discussed to describe especially malicious intrusion faults in a more refined way, by distinguishing different classes of attackers. The resulting reliability of the presented architecture is sketched...|$|R
40|$|Background Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) {{is estimated}} to account for approximately every fifth ischemic stroke. In routine clinical practice, detection of undiagnosed, clinically silent AF represents a major diagnostic challenge, and in up to 30 % of patients with ischemic stroke, AF remains undetected. The MonDAFIS study {{has been designed to}} quantify the diagnostic yield and clinical relevance of systematic electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring for patients with acute ischemic stroke during the subsequent in hospital stay. Study Design A prospective randomized multicenter study in 3, 470 patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack and without known AF on hospital admission. Over a period of approximately 2 years, patients will be enrolled in about 30 German-certified stroke units and randomized 1 : 1 to receive either usual stroke <b>unit</b> <b>diagnostic</b> procedures for detection of AF (control group) or usual stroke <b>unit</b> <b>diagnostic</b> procedures plus standardized and centrally analyzed Holter ECG recording for up to 7 days in hospital (intervention group). Results of the ECG core laboratory analysis will be provided to the patients and treating physicians. All patients will be followed up for treatment and cardiovascular outcomes at 6, 12, and 24 months after enrollment. Outcomes The primary outcome of the randomized MonDAFIS study is the proportion of patients who receive anticoagulation therapy 12 months after the index stroke. Secondary outcomes include the number of stroke patients with newly detected AF in hospital and the rate of recurrent stroke, major bleedings, myocardial infarction, or death 6, 12, and 24 months after the index event. MonDAFIS will also explore patient-reported adherence to anticoagulants, the clinical elevance of short atrial tachycardia, or excessive supraventricular ectopic activity as well as cost-effectiveness of prolonged, centrally analyzed ECG recordings. Conclusion MonDAFIS will be the largest study to date to evaluate whether a prolonged and systematic ECG monitoring during the initial in hospital stay has an impact on secondary stroke prevention. In addition, prognosis as well as adherence to medication up to 2 years after the index stroke will be analyzed. The primary results of the MonDAFIS study may have the potential to change the current guidelines recommendations regarding ECG workup after ischemic stroke. (Am Heart J 2016; 172 : 19 - 25. ...|$|R
