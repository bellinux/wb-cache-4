60|$|In {{an upper}} room of an <b>unoccupied</b> <b>dwelling</b> {{in the part}} of San Francisco known as North Beach lay the body of a man, under a sheet. The hour was near nine in the evening; the room was dimly lighted by a single candle. Although the weather was warm, the two windows, {{contrary}} to the custom which gives the dead plenty of air, were closed and the blinds drawn down. The furniture of the room consisted of but three pieces--an arm-chair, a small reading-stand supporting the candle, and a long kitchen table, supporting the body of the man. All these, as also the corpse, seemed to have been recently brought in, for an observer, had there been one, would have seen that all were free from dust, whereas everything else in the room was pretty thickly coated with it, and there were cobwebs in the angles of the walls.|$|E

CO, SO 2, NO, NO 2, O 3, BTEX, PM 2. 5, black smoke index were monitored simultaneously indoors and outdoors. The indoor/outdoor relationships have been studied regarding ventilation strategies and indoor surface impact. Results show that a reduction of the average daily concentrations of NO (7 - 30 %), SO 2 (33 - 41 %), O 3 (80 %), PM 2. 5 (20 %) and black smoke (20 %) is observed indoors in reference to outdoors. The inert gas CO is integrally transferred. NO 2 shows no apparent difference between outdoor and indoor daily concentrations but the I/O ratio can be significantly above one in summer (high reactivity between NO and O 3). In the presence of sorbing material, indoor concentrations of SO 2, O 3 and NO 2 show a reduction of 75 %, 90 % and 30 % (in winter only for NO 2) compared to outdoors...|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{formulate}} a linear model which can describe household movement caused by new housing supply in a region. Formulating the model we divide the movement process into two stages. The first stage is the movement into dwellings which are newly supplied in a fixed term. The second stage is the movement into vacant dwellings, which consist dwellings haved been resided by household who moved into newly supplied ones {{and other types of}} <b>unoccupied</b> <b>dwellings.</b> We also formulate the model to use variables and parameters as much as possible, which correspond with ones used in existing statistical materials. This can promote operational ability of the model. We apply the model to five typical Prefectures and study operational ability, usefulness and limitations as a descriptive model. Main findings of this study are as follows; 1) Numerical estimation of household movement in the next term can be done using actually supplied dwellings. This gives us useful information not derived from existing statistics and some of estimated values coincides in small error with result of the surveyed data. It means that the model {{can be used as a}} descriptive model. 2) Simulations can be done using supposed supplied dwellings classified by a housing type. Studies on results of these simulations present useful information for housing supply planning...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an empirical study {{to assess the}} occurrence and possible causes of summertime overheating in three occupied and two <b>unoccupied</b> low energy <b>dwellings</b> in the UK. All five dwellings are identical in terms of construction and location, but have different occupancy profiles and household compositions in the three occupied dwellings. An interdisciplinary approach is adopted, drawing from building science and social science methods, including monitoring of interior environmental conditions, thermal comfort diaries and interviews with residents. Temperature data from bedrooms and living rooms from the case study homes were analysed for overheating using both static and adaptive thermal comfort analyses methods. The findings suggest that summertime overheating is prevalent across both occupied and <b>unoccupied</b> case study <b>dwellings,</b> although overheating assessment using static criteria found a much higher proportion of the rooms to be overheated than the adaptive criteria. In the dwellings a common finding was that bedrooms {{were found to be}} more prone to overheating than living rooms. Since it is likely that methods used to assess overheating will be incorporated into regulations in future affecting the design of housing, it is necessary to deploy passive design strategies to prevent the overheating risk in low energy homes...|$|R
