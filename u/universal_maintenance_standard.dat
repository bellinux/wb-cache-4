40|$|Creating {{effective}} written <b>maintenance</b> <b>standards</b> {{is easier}} than you think. BY TODD LOWE 1 et's face it; golf courses are businesses that service thousands of customers each year. mmm Golf course superintendents are given a budget, equipment, and staff and are asked to meet or exceed customer expectations. Other successful businesses have standard operating procedures and long-range plans to improve daily operations and customer satisfaction. Likewise, golf courses should also {{have a set of}} "written <b>maintenance</b> <b>standards</b> that outline the goals and procedures for day-to-day operations. Golf course <b>maintenance</b> <b>standards</b> are guide-lines that detail {{the manner in which the}} golf course is maintained on a daily basis. They are not instruction manuals for each cultural practice or a list of job descriptions for employees, although these can be included. They are, however, formal documents that outline golf course maintenance goals and the necessary practices for meeting these goals. There are <b>maintenance</b> <b>standards</b> in place on all golf courses, but most of them are intangible guidelines, developed and implemented by the golf course superintendent. From our experience, only a small percentage of golf courses develop written <b>maintenance</b> <b>standards</b> with golfer input. Why do so many golf courses operate without any tangible guidelines? Perhaps most of us are apprehensive to step into the unfamiliar, and unless you have been involved with creating <b>maintenance</b> <b>standards,</b> it is difficult to know where to begin. Creating formal <b>maintenance</b> <b>standards</b> is not a difficult task, but it can seem intimidating at first. Aerial photographs can be taken from mobile platforms, like cherry pickers.

40|$|During {{the winter}} 1993 / 94, the Swedish National Road Administration {{received}} considerable criticism for its winter maintenance {{and in particular}} for the high consumption if road salt. This led to discussions on changing the rules for winter maintenance. Some ice or snow was temporary allowed on the roads with high winter <b>maintenance</b> <b>standard.</b> More roads were degraded to lower winter <b>maintenance</b> <b>standard</b> where ice or snow were permanently permitted. In addition, certain changes intended to influence driver behaviour and vehicle equipment for example mandating the use of winter tyres were to be studied. The purpose of the first investigation described in this paper was to calculate the socio-economic consequences that may be expected from a requirement on winter tyres in various circumstances. In the second investigation in this paper the traffic safety effect of the requirement is studied. A requirement of using winter tyres when it is slippery was selected based on facts from the first investigation...|$|R

40|$|A {{study on}} Autonomous Maintenance (AM) {{implementation}} was conducted for CNC machine at automotive components manufacturing line {{in order to}} identify and measure equipment losses related to availability, performance and quality rate. These values were used to determine the overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) of the manufacturing line before and after AM implementation. The project started with AM team formation before it was continued with 5 S activities and fuguai (abnormality) detection and restoration. Kaizen was used for continuous improvement to restore deteriorated parts and components of the machine. Autonomous <b>Maintenance</b> <b>standards</b> such as cleaning, lubricating and inspection were developed. The AM team members consistently followed the operator <b>maintenance</b> <b>standards</b> to ensure that machine is always in good working condition. The OEE results were taken daily after AM implementation and compared with the data before the implementation. The average OEE result shows significant improvement from 65. 8 % to 80. 4 % after the AM implementation. However, the result still did not achieve the company’s target. The main reason was because the machine was very old, which almost reaches deterioration stage according to the bath tub curve. Some recommendations are suggested as to push the OEE value closer to the company’s target including a review on other pillars in Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) ...|$|R
