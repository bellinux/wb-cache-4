50|$|Gasser v MISAT (C-116/02) was a {{decision}} of the European Court of Justice regarding {{the interpretation of the}} Brussels convention of 1968 ruling that a court chosen in a choice of court agreement should stay its proceedings - as any other court chosen second within the Brussels regime - until the court first seized had declared it did not have jurisdiction. The court's decision was considered problematic as it favoured the <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> of the Brussels regime jurisdictional rules temporarily over party autonomy. Due to similar provisions in the 2001 Brussels Regulation and Lugano Conventions, the interpretation also affects choice of court agreements under those later instruments.

50|$|Justice Story {{remains one}} of the most {{significant}} figures in early American constitutional history. Of the many justices of the Marshall Court, only the chief justice himself wrote more opinions than Story. In the 33 years that Story sat on the Court, he would transition from being an ally of Marshall to the last of an old race. Joseph Story, throughout his time on the Marshall and Taney courts, championed the notion of legal science. He believed that the Union could be made stronger through the proper application of law, in particular proper application necessitated <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> <b>application.</b> Consequently, federal control and judicial oversight were important tools in order to craft a more centralized Union. Story was in many respects a creature of New England; however, his chief aim was the creation of a strong Union. Consequently, several of his opinions, such as Prigg, emerge as efforts to protect the Union, despite some of the distasteful consequences. Justice Story's jurisprudence stressed the importance of nationalism through economic centralization and judicial review. While aspects of his jurisprudence would fall into the minority with the rise of Jackson, he continued to guide the Constitutional dialogue through cases like Prigg and Swift.|$|E
50|$|Furrow {{irrigation}} {{is conducted}} by creating small parallel channels along the field length {{in the direction}} of predominant slope. Water is applied to the top end of each furrow and flows down the field under the influence of gravity. Water may be supplied using gated pipe, siphon and head ditch, or bankless systems. The speed of water movement is determined by many factors such as slope, surface roughness and furrow shape but most importantly by the inflow rate and soil infiltration rate. The spacing between adjacent furrows is governed by the crop species, common spacings typically range from 0.75 to 2 metres. The crop is planted on the ridge between furrows which may contain a single row of plants or several rows {{in the case of a}} bed type system. Furrows may range anywhere from less than 100 m to 2000 m long depending on the soil type, location and crop type. Shorter furrows are commonly associated with higher <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> but result in increasing potential for runoff losses. Furrow irrigation is particularly suited to broad-acre row crops such as cotton, maize and sugar cane. It is also practiced in various horticultural industries such as citrus, stone fruit and tomatoes.|$|E

To assist in the task of on-farm water management of furrows and level basin irrigation and the engineering design and planning of these systems management, design charts are proposed that define the optimum combination of inflow rate and cutoff time, given values of required depth and <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> <b>application.</b> The charts are plots of average low-quarter requirement depth and uniformity contours on axes of inflow rate and cutoff time. The general form of the curves shows that technical trade-off between systems becomes evident as flow rates and cutoff times decline as fields are levelled to zero slope and irrigated as basins. The relative steepness and the dense nature of the level basin uniformity contour curves reflect the importance of intense management and the greater penalty for management errors with these systems as opposed to furrows...|$|E

The results indicated that the pH, suspended solids, total iron and coliforms of the WETLAND and UASB + WETLAND treatments represented a severe risk of clogging of drippers; the flow of the emitters increased as the service pressure was increased; values of CUC and CUD in surface and subsurface drip were classified as excellent in ABAST and WETLAND treatments.

The study was performed in a laboratory to evaluate flow in the range of pressure compensation, coefficient of manufacturing variation or discharge (CVF and CVQ), wetting pattern, distribution uniformity coefficient (DUC), and Christiansen uniformity coefficient (CUC). The new and used micro-sprinklers did not differ in CVF and CVQ, and were rated as excellent; they also did not differ in CUC or DUC. The coverage diameters of the new and used micro-sprinklers were the same as those given in the manufacturer’s catalog. There were no significant differences in the flow rates of the new and used micro-sprinklers when subjected to the same pressure, but significant differences in flow rate were observed within the range of pressure compensation.

40|$|Abstraact]: In {{irrigated}} environments the <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> {{the water}} <b>application</b> {{has a major}} effect on the soil water content and the subsequent spatial variation in crop stress and yield. However, the evaluation <b>of</b> sprinkler irrigation <b>uniformity</b> using traditional catch can analyses is resource prohibitive and commonly results in only small grids being used to infer whole field performance. A trial was established in a lettuce crop irrigated with a solid set sprinkler system to evaluate the potential to use electromagnetic sensing for irrigation performance assessment. After crop establishment, the <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> the irrigation <b>applications</b> was deliberately modified within one sprinkler plot (9 m x 11 m) by reducing the sprinkler operating pressures. The <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> the water applied at each irrigation was measured using a grid of catch cans. The apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa) was measured within the plot at multiple times during the cropping season using an EM 38 (Geonics Ltd Canada). The ECa {{was found to be}} poorly correlated with the applied irrigation depths prior to sprinkler modification when the <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> the irrigations was relatively high. However, the correlation improved after sprinkler modification due to the increasing differences in soil moisture. There was generally a poor relationship between the volumes applied at each irrigation and the difference in ECa measured before and after irrigation.

40|$|Spray drift is a {{consideration}} for growers and applicators who are increasingly selecting larger droplet producing nozzles to allay their concerns. As new technologies {{arrive on the}} market, the prices of individual nozzles have risen which puts a greater need for consistency among nozzles to be worth the investment. These nozzles, while effective at reducing spray drift, {{may not always be}} consistent at maintaining efficacy which can be a result of a lack of uniformity in the production of these nozzles. Twenty-one spray drift reducing nozzles were compared for droplet size distributions across three liquids of varying dynamic surface tensions in a wind tunnel at the University of Queensland. Research sought to identify the repeatability of each nozzle type by randomly selecting five units to test consistency of droplet size measurements across nozzle type. Results indicate that some nozzle types are consistent and repeatable while others are not. It was also observed that some nozzle types are relatively unaffected by liquid type, where others resulted in a droplet size change in volume median diameter (VMD) of 100 μm depending on liquid type at the same operating pressure. Research from this study will help growers and industry to select the best nozzle types to ensure <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> <b>application,</b> to maximize efficacy and to reduce pesticide spray drift...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction. Celiac disease (CD) is an {{autoimmune}} disorder {{triggered by}} the ingestion of gluten. Serology and organ culture system can support CD diagnosis, despite histology being the gold standard. Aim. We wanted to test the <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> of Marsh-Oberhuber criteria by five different histologists. We also compared histological and serological data with cultural results to consider new possible strategies in CD diagnosis. Methods. We studied 114 patients, who were divided in two groups. Group A was composed of 66 patients on a gluten-containing diet, with gluten-related signs and symptoms, showing positive serological anti-endomysial antibodies (EMA) and anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti- tTG). Group B was composed of 48 disease-control patients, presenting serological EMA and anti-tTG negative results. All patients studied underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy with duodenal biopsy and duodenal mucosa organ culture. All histological samples were evaluated by five different histologists according to an appropriate questionnaire following Marsh-Oberhuber classification. Cohen κ inter-test was used for evaluating the agreement between histologists regarding group A. Results. Strength of agreement was fair/moderate for villous:crypt ratio, moderate/good for villous height and crypt depth, and poor for intraepithelial lymphocytosis. Patients belonging to group A presented positive serological as well as cultural results in 100 % of cases. None of the patients belonging to group B presented serological or cultural positive results. Discussion. Our study stresses the limits of histological interpretation {{due to the lack}} of uniformity in the use of Marsh-Oberhuber classification. These findings could cast doubt on the role of histology as CD gold standard and could open a debate on the most appropriate CD diagnostic procedure...|$|E
