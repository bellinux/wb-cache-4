5|$|By his own {{description}} of his early family life, Cody grew <b>up</b> <b>poor.</b> His mother worked two jobs, as a traveling nurse and a bus driver, to care {{for him and his}} seven younger siblings.

An unheralded prospect, the Yankees signed Nova as an international free agent in 2004. After pitching in minor league baseball through the 2008 season, the San Diego Padres selected Nova from the Yankees in the Rule 5 draft. The Padres opted not to carry Nova on their 25-man roster, however, and returned him to the Yankees.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{his wide}} range of skills, Rodríguez is known for being equally adept at {{defending}} as he is going forward. Although usually a left-back, his size and physique have also seen him be deployed as a centre-back on occasion. Experts consider him as an accomplished defender and note his strong heading ability, as well his personality. He is also considered a continual attacking threat, and has been noted by analysts for his exceptional stamina and pace, which allow for his constant, buccaneering runs up the wing; he has also drawn praise from pundits for rarely conceding careless fouls. Conversely, he has been criticised for giving too much room to opposition attackers, taking <b>up</b> <b>poor</b> positioning and lacking in defensive discipline, while other analysts have criticised his concentration.|$|E

5|$|Cope and Marsh {{came from}} very {{different}} backgrounds. Cope {{was born into}} a wealthy and influential Quaker family based in Philadelphia. Although his father wanted his son to work as a farmer, Cope distinguished himself as a naturalist. In 1864, already a member of the Academy of Natural Sciences, Cope became a professor of zoology at Haverford College and joined Ferdinand Hayden on his expeditions west. In contrast, Marsh would have grown <b>up</b> <b>poor,</b> the son of a struggling family in Lockport, New York, {{had it not been for}} the benefaction of his uncle, philanthropist George Peabody. Marsh persuaded his uncle to build the Peabody Museum of Natural History, placing Marsh as head of the museum. Combined with the inheritance he received from Peabody upon his death in 1869, Marsh was financially comfortable (although, partly because of Peabody's stern views on marriage, Marsh would remain a lifelong bachelor).|$|E

He played three years as an end on his Forty Fort High School football team and was also a wrestler, winning the state heavyweight title as a senior.|$|E

He grew <b>up</b> <b>poor</b> with his mother (a secretary) and eight siblings in a small apartment in East Oakland.

Alice was sophisticated, shy, and demure—everything Rachel was not. They courted and were to marry in 1969, but the marriage was called off when Rachel crashed their engagement party {{with the news that}} she was carrying Steve's child. She later gave birth to a son named Jamie.|$|E

Vicky was put up for adoption by Reginald and grew <b>up</b> <b>poor</b> in Lassiter, Pennsylvania.

25|$|James I was an enthusiast {{for hunting}} {{but it became}} less fashionable and popular after the Civil War. The number of deer parks then declined, {{contemporary}} books documenting other more profitable uses for such an estate. During the 18th century many deer parks were landscaped, where deer then became optional within larger country parks, several of which were created or enlarged from wealth from trade and colonization in the British Empire. These later mostly gave way to profitable agriculture dependent on crop prices, with {{large parts of the}} workforce having been attracted elsewhere following increasing industrialization. This created pressure to sell off parts or divide such estates while rural population growth pushed <b>up</b> <b>poor</b> law rates (particularly outdoor relief and the Labour Rate) and urban poverty led to the introduction of lump sum capital taxation such as inheritance tax and a shift in power away from the aristocracy.|$|E
25|$|As a {{fifth-generation}} Texan, Lair {{never lost}} his childhood accent. He was raised as an only child, although eventually {{he would come}} to have two younger sisters, and he grew <b>up</b> <b>poor,</b> quiet, and shy. His imagination sparked by his reading, he dreamt of becoming a pilot. He was a seventeen-year-old freshman at Texas A when the attack on Pearl Harbor occurred. Anxious to defend his nation, he applied for naval pilot's training, but was rejected because of substandard eyesight. He then convinced his mother to cosign his enlistment papers into the U.S. Army as a private. He saw his first combat in the invasion of Normandy. His armored unit fought its way across Europe for the next year. Lair's unit ended World War II on the Elbe River, facing a Russian unit on the far bank. It was there that Lair became convinced the American army should have continued the war, and defeated the communists.|$|E

But, he chose to remain the director, saying in a 2014 Variety interview, [...] "you can continue to defer your dreams in exchange for money and, you know, die without ever having done the thing you set out to do". Reiner served as Darabont's mentor on the project instead. Within two weeks of showing the script to Castle Rock, Darabont had a $25 million budget to make his film (taking a $750,000 screenwriting and directing salary plus {{a percentage of the}} net profits), and pre-production began in January 1993.|$|E
500|$|Rapper Snoop Dogg, {{who had a}} {{significant}} role on the album, was praised for his lyrics and flow, and it was mentioned that [...] "Coupled with his inventive rhymes, Snoop's distinctive style made him a superstar before he'd even released a recording of his own" [...] and that his involvement was {{as important to the}} album's success as its production. Touré of The New York Times remarks that [...] "While Snoop delivers rhymes delicately, the content is anything but. Growing <b>up</b> <b>poor,</b> often surrounded by violence, and having served six months in the Wayside County jail outside of Los Angeles (for cocaine possession) gave Snoop Dogg experiences upon which he draws." [...] Snoop Dogg later commented on the [...] "reality" [...] of his lyrics, stating [...] "My raps are incidents where either I saw it happen to one of my close homies or I know about it from just being in the ghetto. I can't rap about something I don't know. You'll never hear me rapping about no bachelor's degree. It's only what I know and that's that street life. It's all everyday life, reality." ...|$|E
500|$|Bouchard {{was born}} September 4, 1919, in Montreal {{the son of}} Regina Lachapelle and Calixte Bouchard. Growing <b>up</b> <b>poor</b> during the depression, Bouchard did not begin skating until he was 16 and had to learn on rented skates, before {{borrowing}} $35 from his brother for {{a complete set of}} hockey equipment which included his own pair of skates. Bouchard opted for a career in hockey over banking when he was offered $75 a week to play senior hockey and the bank paid $7. In the minors Bouchard played with the Verdun Maple Leafs, Montreal Junior Canadiens and Providence Reds. It was Verdun team-mate Bob Fillion who gave Bouchard the nickname [...] "Butch". It originated due to the resemblance of his last name to the English word [...] "butcher". Bouchard was determined, strong and developed enough skills to impress coach Dick Irvin in the Canadiens’ 1940–41 training camp after which he was signed as a free agent. Bouchard had arrived at training camp in peak condition, which was unusual for National Hockey League (NHL) players of the time. To attend this first training camp he rode a bike , which also allowed him to pocket the travel expenses the Canadiens had allotted.|$|E
