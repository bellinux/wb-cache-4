40|$|Partial waxy (reduced-amylose) {{and fully}} waxy (amylose-free) {{tetraploid}} durum wheats (Triticum turgidum L. var durum) {{were developed by}} introgression of null alleles at the Wx-A 1 and Wx-B 1 loci from common hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Purified starches were obtained from each genotype, and chemically modified by: 1) cross-linking with phosphorus oxychloride, 2) substitution with propylene oxide, and 3) sequential cross-linking with phosphorus oxychloride followed by substitution with propylene oxide. Functional properties were compared to blends of waxy and wild-type durum starches of known amylose contents. Significant differences in functionality were observed amongst the genotypes and <b>blends</b> <b>after</b> <b>each</b> modification. Waxy (0 % amylose) and wild-type (30 % amylose) typically were at the extremes of the observed ranges of functional properties. In general, the functional properties of the chemically modified starches were dependent upon amylose content. Starches from Wx-B 1 null lines (24 % amylose), were an exception. After substitution, such starches had the significantly highest value for RVA final viscosity, and generally performed {{in a manner similar}} to starch blends of 12 - 18 % amylose...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project {{was to investigate the}} effect that plasticizers had on starch and poly(lactic) acid blends. The type and ratio of plasticizers used was varied.

The study of the fire properties using the cone calorimeter shows a decrease in the performance caused by the artificial weathering. The chemical modifications of the <b>blends</b> <b>after</b> ageing are investigated by solid state 31 P NMR and SEM. It is shown that APP is degraded into ortho-, pyrophosphate and short chain polyphosphates.
