50|$|Like {{many other}} lakes, Memphremagog is accumulating phosphorus, sediments, and other pollutants, {{primarily}} runoff from farms, but {{from other sources}} as well. Exotic species infestations are a concern, with an existing <b>Eurasian</b> <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> population {{and the potential for}} a zebra mussel infestation. Since the 1970s, significant efforts have been made to reduce the polluting effects of direct discharges into the lake and its tributaries, and lake quality has improved.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the time}} of the most recent survey in 2005, Monson Lake was found to have good water clarity and low to {{moderate}} nutrient pollution. What pollution there was came largely from agricultural runoff. Aquatic and emergent plants exhibited good density and biodiversity. [...] Monson Lake does experience cyanobacteria blooms in summer, but is free of <b>Eurasian</b> <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> and other invasive aquatic plants. The water quality in West Sunburg Lake is considered very high.|$|R
50|$|The lake {{suffers from}} {{eutrophication}} due to excess nutrients blamed on runoff from development and septic {{systems in the}} immediate area. Invasive species are also impacting the lake’s eco-system. These include the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Milfoil.</b> Attractive, but invasive, are water lilies, plentiful at {{the southwest corner of}} the lake and though the passage to the outlet and dam. Strategies to counter these problems include boat inspections for the mussels, periodic partial drainage and lake weed removal.|$|R

50|$|Eurasian watermilfoil has slender stems up to 175 cm long. The {{submerged}} leaves (usually between 15-35 mm long) are borne in pinnate whorls of four, {{with numerous}} thread-like leaflets roughly 4-13 mm long. Plants are monoecious with flowers {{produced in the}} leaf axils (male above, female below) on a spike 5-15 cm long held vertically above the water surface, each flower inconspicuous, orange-red, 4-6 mm long. <b>Eurasian</b> <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> has 12- 21 pairs of leaflets while northern watermilfoil M. sibiricum only has 5-9 pairs. The two can hybridize and the resulting hybrid plants can cause taxonomic confusion as leaf characters are intermediate and can overlap with parent species.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, the Town Board {{created the}} Tonetta Lake Advisory Committee {{to assist the}} Town in {{preserving}} and {{improving the quality of}} Lake Tonetta. The 73 acre lake's viability and recreational uses have been threatened due to invasive aquatic vegetation. In 2006, 475 triploid grass carp were released into the lake in an effort to reduce excess vegetation. Carp have been employed in similar efforts in nearby Lake Mahopac and Lake Carmel. An overabundance of <b>Eurasian</b> <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> prompted officials to put 2,565 grass carp into Lake Mahopac in 1994. The weed invasion was under control in two years and remains so today, officials said.|$|R
5000|$|In 2012, the SBA {{spearheaded the}} {{installation}} of a 255 foot long diversion drain which will allow the water level in the Bowl to be drawn down 5.5 feet in the late fall. Such a drawdown {{has been successful in}} many other lakes in the Berkshires and elsewhere to limit the growth of an invasive <b>Eurasian</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Milfoil.</b> The fout-foot diameter diversion drain cost $1 million to engineer, to get regulatory approval and to install. The SBA worked closely with the Town to raise the funds needed for this project. Richard Seltzer, President of the SBA, has noted that [...] "The ability to achieve a 5.5 foot drawdown is a major milestone in improving and restoring the health of the Bowl. It represents a triumph of cooperation between the Board of Selectmen and the SBA." ...|$|R
5000|$|Milfoil weevils {{occur in}} natural populations {{in much of}} North America on their native host, Northern watermilfoil (Myriophyllum sibiricum). They often reach {{sufficient}} densities to suppress invasive Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum) infestations after a prolonged infestation or artificial augmentation. Studies indicate that for effective control a density of about 1 weevil per two stems of milfoil (0.5 weevils per stem) is necessary [...] There are mixed reviews that fish such as bluegills can reduce weevil populations as research has only been conducted in very limited settings. Augmenting native weevil populations as a biological control is effective {{as long as there}} is a small amount of milfoil to sustain the population. Milfoil weevils are commercially available as a management option for <b>Eurasian</b> <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> by a firm based in the United States and Canada[...]|$|R
50|$|The {{best way}} to {{identify}} whorled <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> (M. verticillatum) is by looking at its {{two different types of}} leaves. The first type is the submersed leave, which looks feathery and contain about 5 to 14 leaflet pairs per leaf. The whorls along the stem contain about 4 to 5 leaves, which are spaced about 1 cm apart. The other type is known as the emergent leaves. These leaves occur on the emergent spike and are pinnately lobed. From June till September whorled <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> produces flowers and fruits above or at the water's surface on erect spikes along the emergent leaves. The emergent leaves are typically two or more times longer than the flowers and fruits. Another way to distinguish whorled <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> is to look for turions, winter buds that appear toward the end of its growing season. This milfoil is one of a few that produce turions. This characteristic can also rule out other types of <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> that lack turions such as <b>Eurasian</b> <b>water</b> <b>milfoil,</b> parrot feather, hybrid <b>water</b> <b>milfoil,</b> and low <b>water</b> <b>milfoil.</b> The turions of this milfoil look like long yellowish-green club-shaped buds with small stiff leaves attached to the submerged stem. In the spring after dormancy the small, thick, dark green turions expand and grow from the stem. As the plant develops roots and continues to grow, the larger green summer leaves are produced {{at the tip of the}} plant. Turion leaves can be seen at the base of the plant sometimes into July. In fall the turions, with some other plant material, often break away from the majority of the rooted plant and float to new areas. Those fragments can be found washing up along shorelines in late fall. The stems of the whorled <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> form into mats from branched and unbranched stems that grow to be 20 to 100 inches long.|$|R
40|$|Harpt Lake (WBIC- 84600) {{is located}} in Manitowoc County {{approximately}} 14 miles northwest of Two Rivers. The lake has a surface acreage of 31 acres, a maximum depth of 54 feet and lies in a 773 acre watershed that is 68. 5 % agricultural (Manitowoc County Soil and Water Conservation Department 2003) (Figure 1). The water quality of Harpt Lake historically, {{has been described as}} turbid, with recent surveys indicating that water quality continues to worsen with increasing levels of phosphorous resulting in increased growth of <b>Eurasian</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Milfoil</b> and filamentous algae (Hoyman and Cibulka 2012). Traditionally, the fishery of Harpt Lake had been dominated by walleye and abundant, small, slow growing panfish. The most recent survey in 2003, a fall electroshocking run found fewer walleye, more bass that were somewhat slow growing, and reduced numbers of panfish that were small but growing normally as compared to earlier surveys (Hogler 2004).

5000|$|In July 2008, several metal spikes up to 3 ft {{in length}} were found {{along the bottom}} of the lake, {{injuring}} one person who accidentally stepped on them. [...] The Seattle Parks Department later confirmed that the spikes were from a forgotten pilot program to control the growth of <b>Eurasian</b> <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> in Green Lake. The invasive aquatic plant had first appeared in the lake in the early 1980s. In 1984, the Parks Department installed 120000 sq ft of black plastic sheeting {{along the bottom of}} the lake, using the spikes to hold the sheeting in place. The spikes originally had curved tips to prevent injury, but the tips had corroded and broken off. The city paid a team of divers to remove the remaining spikes in late July 2008. [...] Throughout the course of the investigation, it was revealed that the city had also tried combating the milfoil with weed-eating fish, but hadn't made any serious efforts in the past 15 years aside from occasionally paying divers to pull the weeds by hand.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{invasion}} of ecosystems by non-native species {{is widely considered}} to be a principal threat to global biological diversity, yet the social costs of invasive species are not well-understood. The {{purpose of this study is}} to estimate a hedonic model of lakeshore property values to quantify the effects of a common aquatic invasive species – <b>Eurasian</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Milfoil</b> – on property values across an extensive system of over 170 lakes in the northern forest region of Wisconsin. In addition to providing empirical evidence as to the potential benefits from reducing the spread of invasive species, this paper also develops a quasi-experimental methodology to identify the effects of changes in endogenous neighborhood amenities within the commonly estimated hedonic framework. In our application, a lake is more likely to be invaded with Milfoil if it is more popular with recreational boaters. Therefore, since lakes popular with recreational boaters are also likely to be popular with potential residents, and since many aspects of a lake’s amenities may be difficult to quantify, the likelihood of Milfoil invasions is endogenous in a hedonic price equation. Our identification strategy is based on a spatial difference-in-difference specification, and uses fixed effects to control for observed and unobserved neighborhood effects, while exploiting changes in the Milfoil status of several lake...|$|R
40|$|A {{laboratory}} assay {{to assess}} colonization of a submersed aquatic plant, <b>Eurasian</b> <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> (Myriophyllum spicatum), by fungi {{was developed and}} {{used to evaluate the}} colonization potential of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Acremonium curvulum, Cladosporium herbarum, Aureobasidium pullulans, a Paecilomyces sp., and an unidentified sterile, septate fungus. Stem segments of plants were first immersed in suspensions of fungal propagules for 24 h and then washed to remove all but the tightly attached component of the population. Inoculation was followed by two growth cycles of 3 days each. At the start of each cycle, washed plants were transferred to a mineral salts medium to provide an opportunity for the attached fungal populations to grow. After each growth period, plants were again washed, and fungal populations in the medium (nonattached), loosely attached and tightly attached to the plant, and within the plant (endophytic) were assayed by dilution plating. The fungi differed in {{the extent to which they}} attached to <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> and in their ability to grow in association with it. There were relatively few significant differences among the tightly attached fungal populations after 24 h, but growth of the better colonizers led to a greater number of significant differences after 4 and 7 days. In addition, the better colonizers showed sustained regrowth of loosely and nonattached fungal propagules in the face of intermittent removal by washing. A milfoil pathogen, C. gloeosporioides, was the only endophytic colonizer; it was also among the best epiphytic colonizers but was not demonstrably better than A. curvulum, a fungus commonly found as an epiphyte on watermilfoil. The yeastlike hyphomycete Aureobasidium pullulans was the only fungus that consistently failed to establish an increasing population on the plant...|$|R
