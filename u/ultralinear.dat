5000|$|The output stage, {{where the}} load is the {{transformer}} {{rather than an}} anode resistor. The original Williamson used KT66 pentodes [...] "triode strapped" [...] (operating as triodes). The majority of later push-pull amplifiers used the <b>ultralinear</b> connection instead.|$|E
5000|$|Post World War II, the {{majority}} of valve power amplifiers are of the Class AB-1 [...] "push pull" [...] <b>ultralinear</b> topology, or lower cost single ended i.e. 6BQ5/EL84 power tubes, but niche products using the DH-SET and even OTL topologies still exist in small numbers.|$|E
50|$|The 807 {{is not a}} {{good choice}} of tube for typical Ultra-Linear {{amplifier}} circuits, as the maximum screen voltage at 300 V is less than half the maximum plate voltage of 750 V. A possible solution is to use an output transformer with a separate <b>ultralinear</b> screen winding, such as the Acrosound TO-350.|$|E
50|$|Small signal valves {{overwhelmingly}} {{changed from}} octal base tubes, notably the audio tube of choice, the 6SN7 family, {{to the smaller}} and cheaper noval base ECC81, ECC82, ECC83 (UK, in the US known as 12AX7,12AT7, etc.). The lower-power noval base EL84 power pentode was widely used in less expensive 10-watt <b>ultralinear</b> power amplifiers, still of high fidelity.|$|E
50|$|By {{contrast}} {{the very latest}} Russian manufactured tubes (2012) not only carry the same internal electrode structure as the original KT66 (they now look the same) they also have the same rugged electrical characteristics and can withstand a high voltage on grid 2 comparable to the anode voltage rating, allowing greater power output afforded by higher voltage capability when run in <b>ultralinear</b> connection.|$|E
50|$|The beam tetrode {{produces}} the lowest distortion of {{this class of}} tube by producing significantly less third-harmonic distortion, and lower intermodulation distortion when used in <b>ultralinear</b> mode. Even-harmonic distortion is automatically cancelled in a push-pull design. The beam tetrode can be operated as a triode (by connecting its screen grid to its anode), and in this mode functions more efficiently than a pentode operated in the same manner.|$|E
5000|$|In 1973 CBS {{changed the}} [...] "tailed" [...] Fender amp logo to the modern-looking [...] "tailless" [...] style (which was first {{introduced}} in 1967 on the student Bronco amp). A master volume knob and a pull-out [...] "boost" [...] pot were added on some amplifiers, followed by <b>ultralinear</b> output transformers and a [...] "scripted tailless" [...] amp decal (featuring a [...] "Made in USA" [...] script in the bottom) in 1977; the power was increased between 70 and 135 watts on certain models.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first series}} of units that were {{produced}} bearing the moniker first appeared from Reeves work bench in 1964 (based on one early example obtained by Plexi Palace). These first models used <b>ultralinear</b> taps for the screen grids. They were a split-chassis design 50 watt {{head with the}} control panel mounted {{on the top of}} the cabinet, and a black and gold nameplate that featured small-case, cursive writing spelling out the name [...] "hi-watt". The original HIWATTs owed more of their design and look to the VOX and SELMER counterparts of the day than to the classic look of the British guitar amplifier that HIWATT later embodied. The DR506 (S/N 159) pictured on this site was built in this shop in 1966, based on receipts still in existence.|$|E
5000|$|Today, Dynaco is {{best remembered}} for its highly {{regarded}} vacuum tube stereo amplifier, the Stereo 70 (ST 70). Introduced in 1959, the ST 70 was {{available as a}} kit (Dynakit) intended for assembly by the purchaser or as a complete factory-wired unit. The ST 70 used four EL34 output tubes, one GZ34/5AR4 rectifier tube, two 7199 input (driver) tubes, two output transformers, one power transformer, and a preassembled printed circuit board (PCB) containing the driver circuit. It produced 35 watts per channel (wpc). The driver circuit had a single 7199 pentode/triode tube per channel, and used the driver tube to handle both voltage amplification and phase splitting. The output transformers are an <b>ultralinear</b> design, whereby part of the primary winding is fed back to the output tube's screen grid. This design reduced distortion and improved audio quality.|$|E
5000|$|In 1950 David Hafler and Herb Keroes {{started a}} Philadelphia-based company called Acrosound {{in order to}} build and sell audio-quality output transformers, {{primarily}} for home electronics hobbyists. [...] The two men refined and developed the <b>Ultralinear</b> audio circuit pioneered by British audio electronics engineer Alan Blumlein, using taps from the output transformer to feed signal back into the output stage screen grid circuitry. [...] The Acrosound transformer circuit was later used in many home-built and commercial hi-fi amplifiers in the early 1950s. [...] In order to appeal to a wider consumer market, Hafler decided to design and build entire power amplifiers as build-it-yourself kits, complete with preassembled, tested circuit boards that only required the customer to wire the boards to the transformers, controls, and power supply to complete the project. [...] This was a considerable advance over other audio system kits of the day, which generally required the purchaser to assemble and test the PC boards themselves, a relatively precise and time-consuming task.|$|E
5000|$|In 1954 Dave Hafler and Herb Keroes parted company. [...] During a {{visit to}} the New York-based Brociner Electronics the same year, Hafler met an audio {{engineer}} named Ed Laurent, who had designed a novel single-tube driver circuit for a power amplifier. [...] In 1955, the two men founded the Dyna Company (later Dynaco) with the intention of not only producing transformers, but high-quality audio circuitry. [...] The company was incorporated in October 1955, with business premises located at 617 N. 41st St in Philadelphia. [...] Dynaco's first product was the Mk. II 50-watt power amplifier. [...] Available as a kit or preassembled unit, the Mk. II was sold for several years until its replacement in 1956 by the Mk. III amplifier, which produced 60 watts. [...] Hafler wrote an article for Radio-Electronics Magazine in 1955 delineating the design of a high-power version of the Williamson amplifier using <b>Ultralinear</b> circuitry and Dynaco's new output transformers. [...] The Williamson amplifier utilized a slightly different circuit design from the Mk. II and Mk. III. [...] Shortly thereafter, the company moved its business operations to 3912 Powelton Avenue in Philadelphia, where they remained for several years.|$|E

40|$|We {{define a}} mapping from the {{context-free}} grammars {{to the class}} of one-state pushdown acceptors. A turn-bounded grammar is a cfg for which its corresponding one-state pda is finite-turn. From S. Ginsburg and E. H. Spanier it follows that this class of grammars generates the <b>ultralinear</b> languages. Our main result is that every turn-bounded grammar is equivalent to a turn-bounded grammar in Greibach form, a property not shared by the <b>ultralinear</b> grammars. Since Greibach's construction does not preserve turnboundedness an alternate construction is required to obtain our result. As a corollary we have that every Ȩ-free <b>ultralinear</b> language is accepted by a onestate finite-turn pda that reads an input symbol on every move...|$|E

40|$|Finite-turn pushdown automata (PDA) are {{investigated}} {{concerning their}} descriptional complexity. It {{is known that}} they accept exactly the class of <b>ultralinear</b> context-free languages. Furthermore, the increase in size when converting arbitrary PDAs accepting <b>ultralinear</b> languages to finite-turn PDAs cannot be bounded by any recursive function. The latter phenomenon is known as non-recursive trade-off. In this paper, finite-turn PDAs accepting bounded languages are considered. First, letter-bounded languages are studied. We prove {{that in this case}} the non-recursive trade-off is reduced to a recursive trade-off, more precisely, to an exponential trade-off. A conversion algorithm is presented and the optimality of the construction is shown by proving tight lower bounds. Furthermore, the question of reducing the number of turns of a given finite-turn PDA is studied. Again, a conversion algorithm is provided which shows that in this case the trade-off is at most polynomial. Finally, the more general case of word-bounded languages is investigated. We show how the results obtained for letter-bounded languages can be extended to word-bounded languages. Comment: 31 pages, 1 figure. A preliminary version was presented at DLT 2007.

Furthermore, we show, that for card(Σ) > 1 the asymptotical density of the language S 2 is zero and that, in the average, each word w of length n in S 2 has exactly one factorization into two palindromes for large n; the variance is zero for large n.

40|$|In 1975, a {{breakthrough}} result of L. Valiant showed that parsing context free grammars {{can be reduced}} to Boolean matrix multiplication, resulting in a running time of O(n^omega) for parsing where omega <= 2. 373 is the exponent of fast matrix multiplication, and n is the string length. Recently, Abboud, Backurs and V. Williams (FOCS 2015) demonstrated that this is likely optimal; moreover, a combinatorial o(n^ 3) algorithm is unlikely to exist for the general parsing problem. The language edit distance problem is a significant generalization of the parsing problem, which computes the minimum edit distance of a given string (using insertions, deletions, and substitutions) to any valid string in the language, and has received significant attention both in theory and practice since the seminal work of Aho and Peterson in 1972. Clearly, the lower bound for parsing rules out any algorithm running in o(n^omega) time that can return a nontrivial multiplicative approximation of the language edit distance problem. Furthermore, combinatorial algorithms with cubic running time or algorithms that use fast matrix multiplication are often not desirable in practice. To break this n^omega hardness barrier, in this paper we study additive approximation algorithms for language edit distance. We provide two explicit combinatorial algorithms to obtain a string with minimum edit distance with performance dependencies on either the number of non-linear productions, k^*, or the number of nested non-linear production, k, used in the optimal derivation. Explicitly, we give an additive O(k^*gamma) approximation in time O(|G|(n^ 2 + (n/gamma) ^ 3)) and an additive O(k gamma) approximation in time O(|G|(n^ 2 + (n^ 3 /gamma^ 2))), where |G| is the grammar size and n is the string length. In particular, we obtain tight approximations for an important subclass of context free grammars known as <b>ultralinear</b> grammars, for which k and k^* are naturally bounded. Interestingly, we show that the same conditional lower bound for parsing context free grammars holds for the class of <b>ultralinear</b> grammars as well, clearly marking the boundary where parsing becomes hard...|$|E
