40|$|This paper adopts Walton and McKersie's Behavioral Theory of Labor Negotiations {{to examine}} the {{outcomes}} of industrial relations negotiations to implement teamworking. Negotiations from 21 departments across two integrated steelworks are classified into four negotiation patterns, each producing different outcomes from teamworking for managers and employees. Managers secured lower manning and increased productivity in negotiations both in departments characterized throughout by cooperation and those characterized by conflict. However, mutual gains were secured only where <b>union</b> <b>negotiators</b> pursued conflict tactics during bargaining. In those departments where <b>union</b> <b>negotiators</b> adopted more conflictual bargaining tactics, more employees reported pay increases and greater satisfaction with teamworking agreements, compared with employees in more 'cooperative' departments.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} impact of one {{particular}} change in industrial conflict legislation in the 1980 s: that is, the requirement for trade unions to hold ballots before industrial action. It does so by analysing {{the results of an}} extensive postal questionnaire survey, covering 846 <b>negotiators</b> in 25 <b>unions.</b> This was part of a wider research project on {{the impact of}} changes in the law, incorporating interviews with employers and senior National Officers of trade unions. The conclusions in the thesis also draw on these findings. The fieldwork was carried out in 1991 and 1992. It took into account a number of modifications - notably in 1988 and 1990 - to the original balloting provisions in the 1984 Trade Union Act. The thesis provides an analysis {{of the impact of the}} industrial action balloting requirement on trade union practices and the role of balloting in negotiations, looking beyond injunctions and high profile court cases. The thesis is primarily concerned to examine the impact of ballots on the processes of collective bargaining. It concludes that the effects of the 1984 balloting laws, including their amendments, were far more complex than anticipated or claimed by the Government. Internally industrial action ballots were accommodated by trade unions into existing consultation processes. The potential for ballots to modify substantive decisions within trade unions, by centralising and formalising decision making, was thereby limited. Amendments to the balloting laws increased the difficulties for trade <b>union</b> <b>negotiators</b> in accommodating ballots in the collective bargaining process. Trade <b>union</b> <b>negotiators,</b> however, sought by and large to conduct industrial action in accordance with the balloting laws and, despite an increasingly restrictive legal framework, there was a widespread perception among trade <b>union</b> <b>negotiators</b> in the early 1990 s that this could bring negotiating advantage. Generally, it is apparent that industrial action ballots were one aspect of a complex process of sometimes radical change in industrial relations throughout the 1980 s...|$|R

5000|$|Buccaneer players {{rejected}} {{a one-year contract}} proposal from team owners that would offer each player a bonus of up to $60,000. Assistant player representative Dave Stalls stated that management was trying to test the strength of an unproven union, and that the bonus amounted to [...] "a bribe not to cross the picket line". [...] The team voted on September 20 to accept the NFLPA executive council's recommendation to go on strike. Only three Buccaneers, of whom Doug Williams {{was the only one}} identified, voted against the strike. As team management made no effort to keep players from crossing the picket line, the players chose not to picket the One Buccaneer Place headquarters. Players initially elected not to hold organized workouts, instead leaving conditioning up to the individuals. Organized workouts were later held at Jesuit High School, but were discontinued when it was felt that they gave management less incentive to bargain. Tampa Bay, who set up an information office with phone lines manned by players who kept teammates informed of all news, was considered by the union to be the most organized of all teams. The strike was estimated to cost the league $42 million per week in lost revenue, with each canceled game costing the players $500,000 in wages. Negotiations went very slowly, with management hoping to weaken union solidarity by prolonging the strike. Agreement was difficult, with both sides making demands vastly different from the other, and pronounced personality conflicts between <b>union</b> <b>negotiator</b> Ed Garvey and management representative Jack Donlan. Planned [...] "All-Star" [...] games by the players failed, {{due to a lack of}} participation by star-caliber players.

40|$|No {{one will}} {{question}} that the share of women working in the Dutch labour market increased over the last decades. It is also apparent {{that there is a}} rapid development of childcare and other work-family balance provisions in collective labour agreements (CLAs) : either these provisions are being included in collective agreements, or existing provisions are being expanded. The reasons for this are obvious: from the employee’s point of view, childcare provisions make it interesting for women to join or stay in the labour market; from the employer’s point of view, although it may be a costly issue, these provisions may help attract and retain female employees. The main question is the following: to what extent can the share of female employees covered by a CLA explain the presence of work-family provisions in CLAs? Furthermore, does the gender of the <b>union</b> <b>negotiator</b> have a significant additional affect? The DUCADAM dataset, a digital database on collective labour agreements in the Netherlands, is used to tackle these questions. The findings show that the hypothesised relationships do not exist. Appar-ently, the supply of work-family provisions in CLAs is not a response to female employees’ demands, nor is it affected by the negotiator’s gender. Rather, economical factors seem to underlie work-family developments in CLAs, as indicated by the positive correlation between work-family provisions and yearly wage increase levels...|$|E

40|$|Desertification affects {{more than}} 900 {{million people in}} 100 {{countries}} and in some, including many in Africa, it is the biggest single environmental, social and economic threat. The UN Environment Programme estimates the cost of desertification at $ 42 billion a year; it is clearly a global problem requiring international effort. In June an international Convention to Combat Desertification convened in Paris but the final formula that was agreed did not promise more finance; instead the possibility was left open to boost funds through various mechanisms including debt cancellation and swaps, and low interest loans and grants to the poorest countries. Many national anti-desertification efforts have failed in the past because of a top-down approach from {{the highest levels of}} government, which have failed to take account or advantage of painstakingly accumulated local knowledge. The Convention encourages full use of local participation and knowledge and urges the exchange of information locally for mutual benefit. A problem not directly addressed is land tenure: in many countries large tracts of land have been acquired by rich and absentee land owners turning local farmers into tenants. This tends to loosen land ownership and use and consequently to accelerate land degradation. Other causes for concern are an absence of political will among leaders and within the international community, and the extensive reassessment of attitudes required for the framework of cooperation set out by the conventions in areas such as technology transfer, information collection, analysis and exchange; research and development; and public education.
