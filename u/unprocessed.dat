5|$|Madagascar's natural {{resources}} include {{a variety of}} <b>unprocessed</b> agricultural and mineral resources. Agriculture (including raffia), fishing and forestry are mainstays of the economy. Madagascar is the world's principal supplier of vanilla, cloves and ylang-ylang. Other key agricultural resources include coffee, lychees and shrimp. Key mineral resources include various types of precious and semi-precious stones, and Madagascar currently provides half of the world's supply of sapphires, which were discovered near Ilakaka in the late 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The {{compartmentalization}} {{allows the}} cell to prevent translation of unspliced mRNA. Eukaryotic mRNA contains introns {{that must be}} removed before being translated to produce functional proteins. The splicing is done inside the nucleus before the mRNA can be accessed by ribosomes for translation. Without the nucleus, ribosomes would translate newly transcribed (<b>unprocessed)</b> mRNA, resulting in malformed and nonfunctional proteins.|$|E
5|$|The exosome {{is a key}} {{complex in}} {{cellular}} RNA quality control. Unlike prokaryotes, eukaryotes possess highly active RNA surveillance systems that recognise <b>unprocessed</b> and mis-processed RNA-protein complexes (such as ribosomes) prior to their exit from the nucleus. It is presumed that this system prevents aberrant complexes from interfering with important cellular processes such as protein synthesis.|$|E
5|$|Néstor Kirchner became {{president}} in May 2003. In the mid-2000s, export of <b>unprocessed</b> soybeans and of soybean oil and meal generated more than 20% of Argentina's export revenue, triple the joint {{share of the}} traditional exports, beef and wheat. Export taxes comprised 8% to 11% of the Kirchner government's total tax receipts, around two-thirds of which came from soy exports. Taxes on imports and exports increased government spending from 14% to 25% of GDP. However, the import and export taxes have discouraged foreign investment, while high spending has pushed inflation over 20%.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{takes place}} in the year 4126 on the Ood-Sphere, the titular planet of the episode. The Doctor (David Tennant) and his {{companion}} Donna Noble (Catherine Tate) investigate Ood Operations, a company that is selling the Ood as a servant race, to discover the reason the Ood are happy to serve. When they find a group of <b>unprocessed</b> Ood, they become horrified at the alterations performed and resolve to free the Ood. The episode was well-received for its central theme of slavery.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of Stanley's {{election}} to the House, the American Tobacco Company had eliminated all its substantial competitors either by acquisition or by driving them out of business. The company worked with British tobacco manufacturers to set tobacco prices worldwide. Congressman Stanley came {{to the defense of}} the tobacco farmers of his district, making him virtually unbeatable as a congressional candidate. In the first of his five consecutive terms, he authored a bill that would remove an oppressive national tobacco tax, hoping this would help raise prices for <b>unprocessed</b> tobacco. The bill was defeated by extensive lobbying efforts by the American Tobacco Company. In 1904, he convinced the Ways and Means Committee to hold public hearings on the American Tobacco Company's monopolistic actions, but the hearings did not convince legislators to repeal the tax nor take action against the American Tobacco Company.|$|E
5|$|In {{laboratory}} experiments, extracts of I. badia fruit {{bodies have}} been shown to have significant antioxidative properties in vitro. Fruit bodies contain the compound theanine, an amino acid and a glutamic acid analogue found in green tea. Efforts have been made to establish a protocol for producing theanine by growing the fungus mycelium using submerged fermentation. Several indole compounds have been detected in fruit bodies. <b>Unprocessed</b> mushrooms contain tryptophan (0.68mg per 100g dry weight), tryptamine (0.47), serotonin (0.52), kynurenine sulphate (1.96), and kynurenic acid (1.57). Due to their temperature sensitivity, cooking significantly changes the contents and composition of indole compounds: cooked mushrooms contained tryptophan (1.74mg/100g dw), 5-methyltryptophan (6.55), melatonin (0.71), and indoleacetonitrile (2.07). Fruit body extracts {{have been shown}} to slow the growth of certain tumour cell lines in cell culture.|$|E
5|$|While burghs {{acted as}} centres of basic crafts. These {{included}} {{the manufacture of}} shoes, clothes, dishes, pots, joinery, bread and ale, which would normally be sold to inhabitants and visitors on market days. However, there were relatively few developed manufacturing industries in Scotland {{for most of this}} period. By the late fifteenth century, there were the beginnings of a native iron-casting industry, which led to the production of cannon and of the silver and goldsmithing for which the country would later be known. As a result, the most important exports were <b>unprocessed</b> raw materials, including wool, hides, salt, fish, animals and coal, while Scotland remained frequently short of wood, iron and, in years of bad harvests, grain, which was imported in large quantities, particularly from the Baltic ports, through Berwick and Ayr.|$|E
5|$|Zinc {{compounds}} {{were probably}} used by early humans, in processed and <b>unprocessed</b> forms, as a paint or medicinal ointment, but their composition is uncertain. The use of pushpanjan, probably zinc oxide, as a salve for eyes and open wounds, is {{mentioned in the}} Indian medical text the Charaka Samhita, thought to date from 500 BC or before. Zinc oxide ointment is also mentioned by the Greek physician Dioscorides (1st century AD.) Avicenna mentions zinc oxide in The Canon of Medicine (1025 AD), which mentioned it as a preferred treatment {{for a variety of}} skin conditions, including skin cancer. Though it is no longer used for treating skin cancer, it is still widely used to treat a variety of other skin conditions, in products such as baby powder and creams against diaper rashes, calamine cream, anti-dandruff shampoos, and antiseptic ointments.|$|E
5|$|However, as {{transshipment}} costs increased, and <b>unprocessed</b> bulk cargos {{decreased in}} volume, {{the economics of}} road transport resulted in a gradual dwindling of traffic on the MSC Railway system, and hence contraction in the MSC Railway itself. Traffic reduction was added to by: the 1969 closure of the CWS Irlam soap works; post nationalisation British Steel Corporation building their own line to Glazebrook to junction with BR; and severe reductions in traffic of ICI's soda ash trains, British Tar Products and reduced domestic coal consumption. With the remaining engines stationed at Ellesmere Port and Stanlow, maintenance {{on the line from}} Irlam through to Partington was halted in late summer 1977, and all through traffic except engineering trains stopped on 21 December 1977. The through line was officially closed to all traffic in 1978, but many of the sidings complexes remained; the last operational section of the MSC Railway, at Trafford Park, closed on 30 April 2009.|$|E
5|$|In November 2011, provincial government-appointed {{auditors}} {{backed up}} claims by Ocean Choice International (OCI) {{that they were}} losing millions of dollars each year operating the Marystown fish plant. On December 2, 2011, the company announced that they would permanently close their Marystown and Port Union fish processing plants and invest money into other plants throughout the province. The following week OCI asked the provincial government for an exemption to export <b>unprocessed</b> fish in return for nearly doubling the workforce at the company's plant in Fortune. Minister King reacted positively to the proposed idea and said the government would consider it. Negotiations on a deal would become tense, with the minister criticizing the company for using 'pressure tactics' {{to try to get}} a deal. OCI said that they were in damage control all around the world because of Minister King's comments. In February 2012, the government rejected a proposal to drop MPRs for the company, saying that it was not in the best interest of the province. In mid October 2012, workers at the Fortune fish plant voted unanimously in favour of allowing OCI to ship out raw fish to China for processing, in return for 110 full-time jobs at their plant. The FFAW, which represented the workers, opposed the move to ship out the raw product. Dunderdale held a cabinet shuffle on October 19, 2012, and appointed Tourism Minister Derrick Dalley as the new Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture. In a news conference held on December 21, 2012, Minister Dalley announced the government would allow Ocean Choice International to ship 75 per cent of its yellowtail flounder quota overseas for processing, along with 100 per cent of its redfish quota. In return a total of 236 year-round jobs, between the Fortune fish plant and on company vessels at sea, for at least five years.|$|E
25|$|<b>Unprocessed</b> milk {{consists}} of globules of milk fat suspended in a watery base containing dissolved proteins, sugars, vitamins, and minerals. If the globules are large enough, as with <b>unprocessed</b> milk from cows, the fat globules float upwards until {{they form a}} distinct cream layer at the top. Some animals, such as goats, produce smaller fat globules that remain mixed unless mechanically separated by centrifugation.|$|E
25|$|The {{residues}} there included {{dark and}} vitrified <b>unprocessed</b> material and fine, yellowish sands from the washing.|$|E
25|$|Indian {{market for}} <b>unprocessed</b> wood is mostly {{fulfilled}} with imports from Malaysia, Myanmar, Côte d'Ivoire, China and New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|Milk – <b>unprocessed</b> cow's milk {{is about}} 4.7% lactose; goat's milk 4.7%; sheep's milk 4.7%; buffalo milk 4.86%; and yak milk 4.93%.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Act did {{not apply}} to <b>unprocessed</b> game or agricultural produce (s.2(4)) but this exception was repealed on 4 December 2000 to comply with EU Directive 1999/34/EC which was enacted because of fears over BSE.|$|E
25|$|Pellagra is {{most common}} to populations within {{developing}} {{countries in which}} corn is the dietary staple. The disease has virtually disappeared from industrialized countries, yet still appears in India and parts of China and Africa. This is {{in part due to}} the bound form of niacin that <b>unprocessed</b> corn contains, which is not readily absorbed into the human body. The processes involved in making corn tortillas, can release the bound niacin into a more absorbable form. Pellegra is not problematic in countries which traditionally prepare their corn in this way, but is a problem in other countries where <b>unprocessed</b> corn is main source of caloric intake.|$|E
25|$|Meat {{is mainly}} {{composed}} of water, protein, and fat. It is edible raw, but is normally eaten {{after it has}} been cooked and seasoned or processed in a variety of ways. <b>Unprocessed</b> meat will spoil or rot within hours or days as a result of infection with and decomposition by bacteria and fungi.|$|E
25|$|Creamed honey, {{also called}} whipped honey, spun honey, churned honey, honey fondant, and (in the UK) set honey, has been {{processed}} to control crystallization. Creamed honey contains {{a large number}} of small crystals, which prevent the formation of larger crystals that can occur in <b>unprocessed</b> honey. The processing also produces a honey with a smooth, spreadable consistency.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{from the}} Harvard School of Public Health found in 2010 that eating {{processed}} meats (such as bacon) that are preserved by smoking, curing or salting, {{or with the}} addition of chemical preservatives, was associated with an increased risk of both heart disease and diabetes. The same association was not found for <b>unprocessed</b> meat.|$|E
25|$|The extreme {{bureaucracy}} involved for {{a fishing}} vessel {{to make a}} port call and land fish results in coastal processing being bypassed. Instead, the seafood is just directly exported, <b>unprocessed.</b> Similarly, there are many bureaucratic difficulties in developing aquaculture. Getting a licence to use water and the necessary sanitary certificates is very time consuming, although it does guarantee environmental and health safety.|$|E
25|$|Opposition to U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommendations, {{such as the}} use of most {{prescription}} drugs and immunizations for managing illness, and instead recommending consumption of <b>unprocessed</b> organic produce, elimination of most sugar and grains from the diet, removing household toxins from cleaning supplies and cosmetics, and energy psychology tools to address emotional challenges while also selling and promoting numerous dietary supplements.|$|E
25|$|Indonesia has {{extensive}} natural resources, including crude oil, natural gas, coal, tin, copper, and gold. Indonesia's major imports include {{machinery and}} equipment, chemicals, fuels, and foodstuffs, and the country's major export commodities include oil and gas, electrical appliances, plywood, rubber, and textiles. In {{an attempt to}} boost the domestic mineral processing industry and encourage exports of higher value-added mineral products, the Indonesian government implemented a ban on exports of <b>unprocessed</b> mineral ores in 2014.|$|E
25|$|Crithidia luciliae is a haemoflagellate protist with an {{organelle}} {{known as}} the kinetoplast. This organelle contains {{a high concentration of}} circular DNA with no recognisable nuclear antigens, allowing for the reliable detection of anti-dsDNA antibodies. The kinetoplast fluoresces if serum contains high avidity anti-dsDNA antibodies. This test has a higher specificity than EIA because it uses <b>unprocessed</b> DNA. Processed DNA can contain regions of ssDNA, allowing detection of anti-ssDNA antibodies, which can give false positive results.|$|E
25|$|Aggravating factors {{surround}} {{the demand for}} seafood from East Asian markets, which encourage commercial fishermen to exhaust stocks in Russia’s EEZ. Russian illegal exporters have well oiled links to importers in Japan, China and South Korea. Criminal groups and corruption magnifies the effect, as the short distances needed to transport seafood from south Kurils and south Sakhalin to Japan. Huge fish processing developments in China built on cheap labour encourage the export of further <b>unprocessed</b> fish.|$|E
25|$|Vegetarians may {{avoid the}} {{negative}} {{health effects of}} processed red meat: A 1999 meta-study of five studies comparing vegetarian and non-vegetarian mortality rates in Western countries found that in comparison with regular meat eaters, mortality from ischemic heart disease was 34% lower in people who ate fish but not meat (pescetarians), 34% lower in ovo-lacto vegetarians, 26% lower in vegans and 20% lower in occasional meat eaters. A 2010 study found that heart disease is not linked with <b>unprocessed</b> red meat.|$|E
25|$|The nixtamalization {{process was}} very {{important}} in the early Mesoamerican diet, as <b>unprocessed</b> maize is deficient in free niacin. A population depending on untreated maize as a staple food risks malnourishment, and {{is more likely to}} develop deficiency diseases such as pellagra. Maize also is deficient in essential amino acids, which can result in kwashiorkor. Maize cooked with lime provided niacin in this diet. Beans, when consumed with the maize, provided the amino acids required to balance the diet for protein.|$|E
25|$|In 1896, Eugen Baumann {{observed}} iodine in thyroid glands. In 1897, Christiaan Eijkman {{worked with}} natives of Java, who also suffered from beriberi. Eijkman observed that chickens fed the native diet of white rice developed {{the symptoms of}} beriberi but remained healthy when fed <b>unprocessed</b> brown rice with the outer bran intact. Eijkman cured the natives by feeding them brown rice, discovering that food can cure disease. Over two decades later, nutritionists learned that the outer rice bran contains vitamin B1, also known as thiamine.|$|E
25|$|Buckwheat hulls {{are used}} as filling {{for a variety of}} {{upholstered}} goods, including pillows and zafu. The hulls are durable and do not conduct or reflect heat as much as synthetic fills. They are sometimes marketed as an alternative natural fill to feathers for those with allergies. However, medical studies to measure the health effects of buckwheat hull pillows manufactured with <b>unprocessed</b> and uncleaned hulls, concluded such buckwheat pillows do contain higher levels of a potential allergen that may trigger asthma in susceptible individuals than do new synthetic-filled pillows.|$|E
25|$|Taxable {{supplies}} include goods wholly within Australia, from or to Australia or {{real property}} in Australia. Certain types of supplies {{are free of}} GST, examples include fresh <b>unprocessed</b> food, medical services, education courses, childcare, exports, pre-owned real estate and going concerns. When an enterprise purchases goods or services to be consumed or used for resupply to an end customer they may receive a refund (input tax credit) {{on the amount of}} GST contained in the price (Div 11), which means in effect no GST is paid on those supplies.|$|E
25|$|Much coltan {{from the}} DRC is {{exported}} to China for processing into electronic-grade tantalum powder and wires. Coltan imports from DRC to Europe are usually directed to Central/Eastern Europe and Russia. These cargoes mostly {{travel through the}} route Dar es Salaam (Tanzania), Piraeus (Greece), then the Balkans. Nova Dies, an offshore consortium based in British Virgin Islands, mostly controls the trans-Balkan transportation network. This network carries mostly <b>unprocessed</b> coltan mined in uncontrolled artisanal mines, and so it hinders the development of processing infrastructure in DRC. Therefore, this route is a long-term threat for DRC economy.|$|E
25|$|Vancouver and Victoria became {{cultural}} centres as poets, authors, artists, musicians, {{as well as}} dancers, actors, and haute cuisine chefs {{flocked to}} the beautiful scenery and warmer temperatures, with the cultural and entrepreneurial community notably bolstered by many Draft dodgers from the United States. Similarly, these cities have either attracted or given rise to their own noteworthy academics, commentators, and creative thinkers. Tourism also began {{to play an important}} role in the economy. The rise of Japan and other Pacific economies was a great boost to British Columbia's economy, primarily because of massive exports of lumber products and <b>unprocessed</b> coal and trees.|$|E
25|$|Every {{context-free}} grammar {{can be transformed}} into an equivalent nondeterministic pushdown automaton. The derivation process of the grammar is simulated in a leftmost way. Where the grammar rewrites a nonterminal, the PDA takes the topmost nonterminal from its stack and replaces it by the right-hand part of a grammatical rule (expand). Where the grammar generates a terminal symbol, the PDA reads a symbol from input when it is the topmost symbol on the stack (match). In a sense the stack of the PDA contains the <b>unprocessed</b> data of the grammar, corresponding to a pre-order traversal of a derivation tree.|$|E
25|$|Familial Shar Pei fever (FSF) is {{a serious}} {{congenital}} disease that causes short fevers lasting from 24 hours, sometimes up to three days and usually accompanied by accumulation of fluid around the ankles (called Swollen Hock Syndrome). Amyloidosis, a long-term condition, is most likely related to FSF, caused by <b>unprocessed</b> amyloid proteins depositing in the organs, most often in the kidneys or liver, leading eventually to renal failure. The disease {{is associated with the}} western type and it is estimated that 23% are affected. The Australian breed standard was changed in 2009 to discourage breeding for heavy wrinkling.|$|E
25|$|Deep {{sequencing}} {{technologies have}} been used to conduct genome-wide analyses of mRNAs – <b>unprocessed</b> and processed – thus providing insights into alternative splicing. For example, results from use of deep sequencing indicate that, in humans, an estimated 95% of transcripts from multiexon genes undergo alternative splicing, with a number of pre-mRNA transcripts spliced in a tissue-specific manner. Functional genomics and computational approaches based on multiple instance learning have also been developed to integrate RNA-seq data to predict functions for alternatively spliced isoforms. Deep sequencing has also aided in the in vivo detection of the transient lariats that are released during splicing, the determination of branch site sequences, and the large-scale mapping of branchpoints in human pre-mRNA transcripts.|$|E
25|$|The use of ginseng (人参) is {{well over}} 2,000 {{years old in}} Chinese medicine. Ginseng {{contains}} ginsenosides. The amount of ginsenosides in ginseng depends on how the plant was cultivated {{and the age of}} the root. Wild ginseng is rare and commands the highest prices on the market. Red Panax ginseng is the most popular form of ginseng and it is usually packaged as a liquid or tea. Ginseng comes in two kinds, red and white. The color of the ginseng depends on how it is processed. White ginseng is <b>unprocessed</b> and dries naturally. Red ginseng is processed with steam and is believed to be more effective. Native Americans have used American ginseng for dry coughs, constipation, and fevers.|$|E
