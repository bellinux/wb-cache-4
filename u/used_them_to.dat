5|$|The siege {{was broken}} in March 1776 when Continental Army Colonel Henry Knox brought heavy {{artillery}} from Fort Ticonderoga to Boston during the winter, and General Washington <b>used</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> fortify Dorchester Heights, overlooking Boston and its harbour. Howe at first planned {{an assault on}} this position, but a snowstorm interfered, and he eventually decided to withdraw from Boston. On 17 March, British troops and Loyalists evacuated the city, and sailed for Halifax, Nova Scotia.|$|E

5|$|A 2017 {{study by}} Thomas D. Carr, David J. Varricchio et al found that tyrannosaurs had large, flat scales on their snouts. At {{the center of}} these scales were small, keratinised patches. In crocodilians, such patches cover dense bundles of nerve fibers that pick-up {{vibrations}} and pressure changes. They proposed that tyrannosaurs probably also possessed such bundles of sensitive nerve fibers and may have <b>used</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> identify objects, measure the temperature of their nests and to pick-up eggs and hatchlings.|$|E
5|$|After the war ended, {{the fort}} {{remained}} standing into the 1840s; {{in the immediate}} aftermath of the war's conclusion the site was occupied by two squatters. In 1847 George Bainbridge purchased the land and the fort from the United States federal government. Bainbridge salvaged what logs were usable from the fort, dismantling it in the process, and <b>used</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> construct a barn on his property. The fort site remained relatively undisturbed in the ensuing years. In 1994 the non-profit Apple River Historical Foundation was organized and archaeological investigation was conducted in 1995. In June 1997 a reconstruction effort ended, and today a replica of the fort stands to the south of the original site, which remains undisturbed to preserve its archaeological integrity.|$|E

5|$|Contrary to {{what many}} outsiders believed, most {{residents}} of the Walled City behaved similarly to other Hong Kong natives. In response to difficult living conditions, the residents formed a tightly knit community, helping one another endure various hardships. Within families, wives often did housekeeping, while grandmothers cared for their grandchildren and other children from surrounding households. The City's rooftops were an important gathering place, especially for residents who lived on upper floors. Parents <b>used</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> relax, and children would play or do homework there after school.|$|E
5|$|Galland flew {{his first}} of 300 combat mission in Spain with the J/88 {{commander}} Gotthard Handrick, on 24 July 1937, near Brunete. During {{his time in}} Spain, Galland analysed the engagements, evaluated techniques and devised new ground-attack tactics which were {{passed on to the}} Luftwaffe. His experiences in pin-point ground assaults were used by Ernst Udet, a proponent of the dive bomber and leading supporter of the Junkers Ju 87 to push for Stuka wings. Wolfram von Richthofen, an opponent of Udet's, <b>used</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> push for the opposite: Schlachtflieger dual combination fighter-bombers. After trials with Henschel Hs 123s, Bf 109s and Ju 87s, the Junkers was selected to undergo trials for the dive bomber role.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{stars have}} been {{important}} to civilizations throughout the world. They {{have been part of}} religious practices and used for celestial navigation and orientation. Many ancient astronomers believed that stars were permanently affixed to a heavenly sphere and that they were immutable. By convention, astronomers grouped stars into constellations and <b>used</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> track the motions of the planets and the inferred position of the Sun. The motion of the Sun against the background stars (and the horizon) was used to create calendars, which could be used to regulate agricultural practices. The Gregorian calendar, currently used nearly everywhere in the world, is a solar calendar based on the angle of the Earth's rotational axis relative to its local star, the Sun.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, 220 coffee growers {{formed an}} {{association}} in the Maraba district (part {{of the former}} Butare Province) to tackle this problem. Many of these farmers had lost family members during the 1994 genocide, while others had husbands in prison, accused of participating in the killings and due to face trial in the traditional gacaca courts. They named the association Abahuzamugambi, a Kinyarwanda word for people who work together to achieve a goal. The farmers hoped that by forming the association, they would increase revenue by selling directly to exporters in Kigali instead of through an intermediary transport company. They divided their profits and <b>used</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> buy tools, fertilisers and seeds to increase yields.|$|E
5|$|In August, several Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) generals {{proposed}} {{the imposition of}} martial law, ostensibly {{to break up the}} demonstrations, but in reality to prepare for a military coup. However, Nhu, already looking to arrest Buddhist leaders and crush the protest movement, used the opportunity to preempt the generals and embarrass them. He disguised Tung's Special Forces in army uniforms and <b>used</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> attack the Buddhists, thereby causing the general public and South Vietnam's U.S. allies to blame the army, diminishing the generals' reputations and ability to act as future national leaders.|$|E
5|$|In Greece, Rome, and Etruria, {{the use and}} {{development}} of musical instruments stood {{in stark contrast to}} those cultures' achievements in architecture and sculpture. The instruments of the time were simple and virtually all of them were imported from other cultures. Lyres were the principal instrument, as musicians <b>used</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> honor the gods. Greeks played a variety of wind instruments they classified as aulos (reeds) or syrinx (flutes); Greek writing from that time reflects a serious study of reed production and playing technique. Romans played reed instruments named tibia, featuring side-holes that could be opened or closed, allowing for greater flexibility in playing modes. Other instruments in common use in the region included vertical harps derived from those of the Orient, lutes of Egyptian design, various pipes and organs, and clappers, which were played primarily by women.|$|E

Webb took depositions about the Milne Bay incident {{from members of the}} Allied forces who had been present, and <b>used</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> form part of his report. In 1944 this was submitted to the United Nations War Crimes Commission, which had been set up by the Allies following the Moscow Declaration. Evidence about the crimes was presented to the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal on 2 January 1947, but no Japanese personnel were prosecuted for actions during the fighting at Milne Bay.|$|E
5|$|On July 11, {{a passing}} {{motorist}} spotted the fugitives by Interstate 80 and called police. The men fled when authorities {{arrived at the}} scene shortly after, but Bostic was tackled by a state trooper shortly after 6 p.m., while Ellis managed to escape. At 8 a.m. the next morning, Ellis was cornered near I-80 by two police dogs. Both men were extradited to New York from Pennsylvania on July 12. Police brought Timoshenko's handcuffs and <b>used</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> apprehend Ellis during his arrest. Police did not release {{the name of the}} driver who assisted the suspects.|$|E
5|$|The Cottingley Fairies {{appear in}} a series of five {{photographs}} taken by Elsie Wright (1901–88) and Frances Griffiths (1907–86), two young cousins who lived in Cottingley, near Bradford in England. In 1917, when the first two photographs were taken, Elsie was 16 years old and Frances was 9. The pictures {{came to the attention of}} writer Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who <b>used</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> illustrate an article on fairies he had been commissioned to write for the Christmas 1920 edition of The Strand Magazine. Doyle, as a spiritualist, was enthusiastic about the photographs, and interpreted them as clear and visible evidence of psychic phenomena. Public reaction was mixed; some accepted the images as genuine, but others believed they had been faked.|$|E

5|$|The fourth {{match was}} for the vacant WWE Intercontinental Championship between Christian and Chris Jericho in a Ladder match. The two superstars brawled early into the match, but they then {{retrieved}} ladders and <b>used</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> their advantage. Christian was then able to gain control over the match after he performed a running enziguri onto Jericho. The two superstars then continued in a back and forth match, until Jericho applied the Walls of Jericho on Christian, {{on the top of}} the ladder, which caused Christian to fall down. Jericho failed to retrieve the title on the first attempt, but was able to set up another ladder and successfully retrieved the title on the second attempt, thus Jericho winning the match and the WWE Intercontinental Championship for a record sixth reign at the time.|$|E
5|$|The {{men in the}} Castle Inn {{retreated to}} Penydarren House, who were joined by the initial {{reinforcements}} from the Yeomanry, bringing the establishment's numbers to around 300, {{not all of them}} were armed and able to fight. They faced increasingly well-armed insurgents and Bute became increasingly concerned {{about the quality of the}} opposition facing his men. Bute sent spies into the insurgency, and nearby Cyfarthfa Castle was pressed into service as an observation post. Bute mobilised military pensioners, and <b>used</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> start to bring Penydarren House additional weaponry from Cardiff; he was advised to be careful, however, in case the shipments fell into the hands of the insurgency. Morgan's forces were able to prevent the radical crowds from entering either Penydarren or Cyfartha, and Bute arrested potential insurgents in Cardiff.|$|E
5|$|These {{changes were}} {{embodied}} in the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907, which passed the Commons with little opposition save for a dispute over the future status of Militia regiments.

The Militia provided the Special Reserve, which would contain men who had not served in the regular Army but agreed to be liable for service with the regular forces in wartime.|$|E
