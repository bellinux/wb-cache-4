5|$|Like {{the first}} welding process, forge welding, some modern welding methods {{do not involve}} the melting of the {{materials}} being joined. One of the most popular, <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>welding,</b> is used to connect thin sheets or wires made of metal or thermoplastic by vibrating them at high frequency and under high pressure. The equipment and methods involved are {{similar to that of}} resistance welding, but instead of electric current, vibration provides energy input. Welding metals with this process does not involve melting the materials; instead, the weld is formed by introducing mechanical vibrations horizontally under pressure. When welding plastics, the materials should have similar melting temperatures, and the vibrations are introduced vertically. <b>Ultrasonic</b> <b>welding</b> is commonly used for making electrical connections out of aluminum or copper, and it is also a very common polymer welding process.|$|E

Specific alloys are used in Oil & Gas downhole applications and nickel hydrometallurgy for their high strength (e. g.: titanium Beta C alloy), corrosion resistance, or both. The pulp and paper industry uses titanium in process equipment exposed to corrosive media, such as sodium hypochlorite or wet chlorine gas (in the bleachery).

40|$|<b>Ultrasonic</b> spot <b>welds</b> {{have been}} used as a model system to {{investigate}} how to determine the mode-I cohesive parameters associated with interfacial fracture of a spot weld. Numerical analyses indicated that, while multiple combinations of the two cohesive parameters (characteristic strength,, and toughness, Γ I) could result in virtually indistinguishable behaviors for individual geometries, only a single pair of parameters can provide a unique set of behaviors for different test geometries. This provides the basis for determining the cohesive parameters by comparing numerical predictions to experimental observations. In particular, a direct uniaxial tensile test was found to be particularly useful for measuring the characteristic strength of an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>weld.</b> With the characteristic strength known, the toughness of the weld was determined by fitting numerical predictions to experimental observations of the load–displacement curves obtained from T-peel specimens bonded with the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>weld.</b> These two parameters were then used without modification to predict the performance of welded U-peel specimens. The numerical predictions for this third configuration were in excellent agreement with the experimental results, verifying that {{it may be possible to}} use cohesive-zone parameters to predict the behavior of different geometries of spot welds formed under nominally similar conditions...|$|R

40|$|Increasing the strength, {{reliability}} and durability of welded structures {{is an important}} problem in welding engineering. A significant influence is exerted by residual stresses. Uneven heating of the product during welding causes its uneven temperature deformation. The product material solidity prevents the free temperature deformation of its individual parts, resulting {{in the formation of}} stresses and plastic deformation of some parts of the joint metal during welding, and after cooling, welding stresses and deformations remain in the product. The paper describes an innovative technology of thermal <b>welding</b> with <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>weld</b> joint treatment as applied to aluminum sliding formworks used in NPP construction. Ultrasonic treatment in the process of welding greatly increases the strength of formwork weld joints by reducing their residual stresses, grain size and degassing. The structure and properties of aluminum welds become identical to the base metal. Thermal <b>welding</b> with <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>weld</b> joint treatment will improve the reliability of welded joints and increase their time in service.

40|$|Fatigue {{behavior}} of dissimilar <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>welds</b> between magnesium alloy AZ 31 and galvanized steel sheets is investigated experimentally, with {{stress intensity factor}} solutions and with a kinked crack growth life estimation model. First, stress intensity factor solutions for welds with various widths in lap-shear specimens with and without kinked cracks are obtained using finite element analyses. The analytical stress intensity factor solutions for lap-shear specimens based on the beam bending theory and the analytical solutions for two dissimilar semi-infinite solids with connection under plane strain conditions are reviewed. Results of the finite element analyses for global stress intensity factor solutions are compared with the analytical stress intensity factor solutions to identify transition weld widths for the analytical solutions. Finite element analyses were also conducted for the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>welded</b> lap-shear specimens of magnesium and steel sheets, but with a modified fictitious Poisson’s ratio for the magnesium sheet such that the bimaterial constant is equal to zero. The {{results indicate that the}} crack-tip stresses directly ahead of the main crack tip are influenced by the oscillation of the interface crack-tip field. However, the crack-tip stresses directly above the main crack tips are weakly affected, and the oscillatory crack-tip stress distributions for both actual and modified material combinations are quite similar. The results suggest that the stress intensity factor solutions for a kinked crack with a vanishing kink length can be approximated by the available analytical solutions for fatigue life estimation. Experimental fatigue results for dissimilar <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>welds</b> are presented for lap-shear specimens which have been machined into a dog-bone profile to approximate linear welds and specimens which have not been altered. Optical micrographs of the welds after testing were examined to understand the failure modes. Stress intensity factor solutions were obtained from finite element analyses of a plane strain model and a three-dimensional model. The global stress intensity factor solutions and the local stress intensity factor solutions for vanishing and finite kinked cracks were used for fatigue life estimations using a Paris law kinked crack growth model...|$|R

40|$|In {{the first}} part of this {{dissertation}} research, failure modes of similar laser and dissimilar <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>welds</b> in lap-shear specimens under quasi-static loading conditions were investigated. High strength low alloy (HSLA) steel sheets were used to make laser welded lap-shear specimens. Magnesium and HSLA steel sheets were used to make <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>welded</b> lap-shear specimens. Quasi-static tests were conducted on dog-bone shaped lap-shear specimens for both welds. In order to understand the failure mode of the welds, finite element analyses were conducted to identify the effects of the material properties and the weld geometry. The results of the finite element analyses for the laser weld based on multi-zone non-homogeneous material models show that the higher effective stress-plastic strain curves of the weld and heat affected zones and the geometry of the weld protrusion result in the necking/shear failure mode in the load carrying sheet. The results of the finite element analyses for the dissimilar <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>weld</b> based on multi-zone indentation models show that the weld indentation triggers different plastic flow patterns in the load carrying sheet. In the second part of this dissertation research, closed-form analytical solutions to calculate the load distributions by the rolling elements on the raceway for zero-interference and interference conditions in roller bearings were investigated. A special case involving cam follower roller bearings was also investigated. The contact solutions by Hertz and Persson provided the analytical background for the proposed solutions. These solutions along with an assumption that the multiple contacts of rolling elements are similar to the contact of a lumped body corresponding to the rolling elements were used to derive the proposed solutions. The proposed closed-form solutions require minimal input parameters and therefore are expected to be widely used in the bearing industry. Finite element analyses were conducted to validate the proposed solutions for selected geometries and loads. Based on the proposed solutions, a complete yet simple procedure to estimate the fatigue lives of roller bearings were introduced for use in the bearing design and selection processes...|$|R

40|$|The {{quality of}} Caterpillar's welds is {{becoming}} increasingly important as their equipment is made leaner {{with the goals of}} increased performance, lighter weight and lower unit cost. Due to the inherently variable nature of arc welding, non-destructive weld evaluation is critical to ensure that welding processes remain in control, and that defective parts are quarantined and repaired before being released downstream. The "conventional" <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>weld</b> inspection technology in use at present has several limitations: [...] Areas within common joint configurations cannot be adequately inspected due to geometry constraints; [...] Discontinuity evaluation requires subjective real-time human interpretation by highly trained operators; [...] The data produced by the instrumentation is unconducive to recording for off-line analysis; [...] Imprecise defect sizing leads to Type I and Type II inspection errors - the unnecessary rework of good parts, and the inappropriate release of non-complying parts. This project addressed these limitations of conventional <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>weld</b> inspection by identifying and evaluating alternative commercially available technologies and by initiating the internal development of specific proprietary technologies tailored to Caterpillar's needs. Through collaboration with Caterpillar's non-destructive evaluation (NDE) community, as well as outside vendors, a technology known as "phased array" was selected and validated in the laboratory and production environments. Although phased array was not new to Caterpillar, its adoption within the production facilities had previously been limited. by Michael T. Buelsing. Thesis: M. B.

The first study investigated the effect of a range of weld forces, energies, and amplitudes in a lap joint geometry using a bench top <b>ultrasonic</b> plunge <b>welding</b> system. Weld strength was determined by measuring resistance to tearing and peel and shear strength.
