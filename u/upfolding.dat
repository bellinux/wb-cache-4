2500|$|Originally {{there was}} an isthmus across the Strait of Dover. During an earlier glacial maximum, the exit from the North Sea was blocked to the north by an ice dam, and the water flowing out of rivers backed up into a vast lake with {{freshwater}} glacial melt on the bed {{of what is now}} the North Sea. A gently <b>upfolding</b> chalk ridge linking the Weald of Kent and Artois, perhaps some 30 metres (100feet) higher than the current sea level, contained the glacial lake at the Strait of Dover. At some time, probably around 425,000 years ago and again around 225,000 years later the barrier failed [...] or was overtopped, loosing a catastrophic flood that permanently diverted the Rhine into the English Channel and replacing the [...] "Isthmus of Dover" [...] watershed by a much lower watershed running from East Anglia east then southeast to the Hook of Holland and (as at modern sea level) separated Britain from the continent of Europe; a sonar study of the sea bed of the English Channel published in Nature, July 2007, revealed the discovery of unmistakable marks of a megaflood on the English Channel seabed: deeply eroded channels and braided features have left the remnants of streamlined islands among deeply gouged channels where the collapse occurred.|$|E

50|$|To {{the north}} is Longstone Edge, a {{limestone}} ridge some 1,300 ft in height, on an <b>upfolding</b> of the Derbyshire limestone known as the Longstone Anticline. It has been, and is, intensively quarried for galena, fluorspar, barytes and, more controversially, limestone. Since Longstone Edge is a noted beauty spot and is within the Peak District National Park there is strong local pressure for quarrying to stop altogether. Some of the quarrying is strictly controlled by the Peak District National Park Authority, which has been conducting a lengthy legal battle {{to try to stop}} other quarries that are operating outside the authority's guidelines. Further north is the White Cliff, where the exposed limestone contains fossilised corals.|$|E

2500|$|That year Charles <b>Upfold</b> {{purchased}} the soap and candle factory of Frederick Nainby at Wickham and Honeysuckle Point, Newcastle, {{and in the}} Newcastle Chronicle of 16 May 1869 there is {{a reference to the}} [...] "Great Northern Soap and Candle Works, proprietor, Charles Upfold." [...] By the following year <b>Upfolds</b> plants were producing 9,420 hundredweight of soap and 600 cwt of candles. By 1872 soap production had increased to 21,000 cwt. Most was exported, much to China. That year <b>Upfold</b> expanded his Australian trading links by establishing a Sydney office at 50 Clarence Street.|$|R
50|$|In December 1849, <b>Upfold</b> {{was elected}} Bishop of Indiana. He was the 50th bishop in the ECUSA, and was consecrated on December 16, 1849 by Bishops Benjamin Bosworth Smith, Charles Pettit McIlvaine, and Jackson Kemper. While bishop, <b>Upfold</b> {{also served as}} rector for St. John's Church in Lafayette, Indiana and Christ Church Cathedral in Indianapolis. By 1855, the Diocese of Indiana had built is status and {{stability}} {{to the point that}} it could financially support the office of bishop, allowing <b>Upfold</b> to concentrate only on his duties as bishop. <b>Upfold</b> received a LL.D. degree from the Western University of Pennsylvania in 1856. In 1857 he moved the seat of the Diocese to Indianapolis where he remained in office until 1872. He served as the sole bishop until 1865 when, crippled by gout, he arranged for the election of a coadjutor bishop.|$|R

5000|$|The working {{system of}} the RMb-93 is itself an odd slide-action {{operation}} called [...] "Inverted Cycle", similar in concept to the one used in the South-African Truvelo Armoury Neostead shotgun (the only other mass-produced firearm to be based upon this system). The feeding tube is placed over the barrel rather than under it, and tilts upwards for loading. Once the weapon is loaded, a shell is chambered by pushing the slide forward-then-backward, instead of the standard backward-then-forward motion of the forend found on most pump-action weapons. Having the RMb-93 a fixed breech face and movable barrel, the operation moves the entire barrel assembly. Once a round is fired and another is chambered, the empty shell falls downwards to the ground, pushed by its own weight.The design of the RMb-93 [...] "Rys-K" [...] carries several advantages: the ejection system makes the gun fully ambidextrous, and the magazine located over the barrel gives the shotgun a low center of mass and reduces upward recoil. The main drawback of the overall design stands {{in the fact that}} the weapon has a pistol grip with <b>upfolding</b> metal stock, which when folded finds itself right up the feeding tube. The RMb-93 thus can not be reloaded without extending or removing the stock, a disadvantage if it is being used tactically with a folded stock.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper is to present a {{versatile}} scheme for the computation of optical properties of solids, with particular emphasis on realistic many-body calculations for correlated materials. Geared at the use with localized basis sets, we extend the commonly known lattice "Peierls substitution" approach {{to the case of}} multi-atomic unit cells. We show in how far this generalization can be deployed as an approximation to the full Fermi velocity matrix elements that enter the continuum description of the response of a solid to incident light. We further devise an <b>upfolding</b> scheme to incorporate optical transitions, that involve high energy orbitals that had been downfolded in the underlying many-body calculation of the electronic structure. As an application of the scheme, we present results on a material of longstanding interest, vanadium dioxide, VO 2. Using dynamical mean-field data of both, the metallic and the insulating phase, we calculate the corresponding optical conductivities, elucidate optical transitions and find good agreement with experimental results.
