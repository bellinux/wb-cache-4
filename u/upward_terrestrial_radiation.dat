40|$|The climate {{influence}} of the land ice that existed 18, 000 years before present (18 K B. P.) is investigated by use of a general circulation model of the atmosphere coupled with a static mixed layer ocean. Simulated climates are obtained from {{two versions of the}} model: one with the land ice distribution of the present and the other with that of 18 K B. P. In the northern hemisphere the tropospheric flow field is strongly influenced by the Laurentide ice sheet and features a split flow straddling the ice sheet, with a strong jet stream forming the southern branch. The northern branch of the flow brings very cold air over the North Atlantic Ocean, where thick sea ice is maintained. The distribution of sea surface temperature (SST) difference between the two experiments in the northern hemisphere resembles the difference between the SST at 18 K B. P. and at present, as estimated by the CLIMAP Project (1981). The 18 K B. P. ice sheets have very little influence upon atmospheric temperature and SST in the southern hemisphere. This is because the interhemispheric heat transport hardly changes as the loss of heat energy due to the reflection of solar radiation by continental ice sheets in the northern hemisphere is almost completely counterbalanced by the in situ reduction of <b>upward</b> <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radiation.</b> Hydrologic changes in the model climate are also found, with statistically significant decreases in soil moisture occurring in a zone located to the south of the ice sheets in North America and Eurasia. These findings are consistent with some geological evidence of regionally drier climates from the last glacial maximum. 1...|$|E
40|$|The aircraft-based {{experiment}} KABEG' 97 (Katabatic {{wind and}} boundary layer front experiment around Greenland) {{was performed in}} April/May 1997. The experimental investigations comprised the katabatic wind system over Greenland and measurements of boundary layer fronts (BLFs) over the Davis Strait. Both phenomena are important for {{the understanding of the}} climate of the Arctic and the Antarctic. The research aircraft POLAR 2 owned by the Alfred-Wegener-Institut (AWI) was based at Kangerlussuaq. During the experiment, surface stations were installed at five positions on the ice sheet and in the tundra. The GPS navigated aircraft was instrumented with the turbulence measuring device 'METEOPOD', allowing high-resolution measurements and the determination of turbulent momentum, sensible and latent heat fluxes. In addition, downward and <b>upward</b> solar and <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radiation</b> and surface temperature were measured; a high-resolution laser altimeter registered surface roughness structures. The GPS dropsonde facility of the aircraft was used for the BLF program over ocean. A total of 13 flights have been performed, three of them were BLF flights. The BLF flights took place during cold air outbreaks over the Davies Strait under conditions of low-level flow parallel to the sea ice edge wind speeds of about 20 m/s. The katabatic wind flights were performed during quite different synoptic situations and surface conditions, and low-level jets with wind speeds up to 25 m/s were measured under strong synoptic forcing of the katabatic wind system.

40|$|Deforestation in the Amazon {{region will}} {{initially}} impact the energy balance at the land surface through changes in land cover and surface hydrology. However, continuation of this human activity will {{eventually lead to}} atmospheric feedbacks, including changes in cloudiness which may {{play an important role}} in the final equilibrium of solar and <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radiation</b> at the surface. In this study, the different components of surface radiation over an undisturbed forest in the Amazon region are computed using data from the Amazon region micrometerological experiment (ARME). Several measures of cloudiness are defined: two estimated from the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radiation</b> measurements, and one from the solar radiation measurements. The sensitivity of the surface fluxes of solar and <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radiation</b> to natural variability in cloudiness is investigated to infer the potential role of the cloudiness feedback in the surface energy balance. The results of this analysis indicate that a 1 % decrease in cloudiness would increase net solar radiation by ca. 1. 6 W/m 2. However, the overall magnitude of this feedback, due to total deforestation of the Amazon forest, is likely to be of the same order as the magnitude of the decrease in net solar radiation due to the observed increase in surface albedo following deforestation. Hence, the total change in net solar radiation is likely to have a negligible magnitude. In contrast to this conclusion, we find that <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radiation</b> is likely to be more strongly affected; reduced cloudiness will decrease net terrestrial radiation; a 1 % decrease in cloudiness induces a reduction i...|$|R

40|$|A new {{parameterization}} {{of solar}} and <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radiation</b> {{was developed and}} tested. The solar radiation parameterization is based on that of Lacis and Hansen (1974), but with zenith-angle-dependent surface albedoes, and revised treatments of cloudiness. The <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radiation</b> parameterization {{is based on the}} work of Chou (1984) for water vapor, Chou and Peng (1983) for carbon dioxide, and Rogers (1968) for ozone, with a new parameterization of the effects of clouds. Results obtained were compared with the new parameterizations to those obtained with the earlier parameterization described by Schlessinger (1976). Several dramatic improvements came to light. For the most part these are related to the fact that the new <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radiation</b> paramerization includes the effects of the water vapor continuum, while the earlier parameterization does not. In the moist tropical planetary boundary layer (PBL) continuum emission leads to much stronger cooling of the PBL over the oceans. Over land, however, the cooling of the PBL is significantly reduced. The latter, somewhat paradoxical result is due to the strong diurnal cycle of the continental PBL. At night the shallow continental PBL is overlain by a moist layer created by mixing during the previous afternoon. The moist upper layer acts as a radiative blanket, reducing the time-averaged radiative cooling of the continental PBL...|$|R

40|$|Saharan Dust Experiment (SHADE) {{are used}} to {{quantify}} {{the effect of a}} strong dust outbreak on radiance and brightness temperatures. The dust gives a distinct spectral signature in upwelling and downwelling <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radiation</b> when high spectral resolution data for a dusty day is compared to data from a clear day. A radiative transfer model is used together with a size distribution retrieved from Sun photometers and atmospheric profiles from dropsondes to simulate the radiance data and provide a constraint on the refractive indices of Saharan dust in the terrestrial part of the spectrum. The degree of agreement between observed and simulated brightness temperatures is dominated by the choice of refractive index, the mass loading, and the altitude of the dust layer. The uncertainties in size distribution appear to have less of an effect so long as large particles (radius greater than 1 mm) are included. In the terrestrial spectrum the dust produced a relative warming rate of up to 0. 5 K/day below the dust and a relative cooling of up to 0. 5 K/day within the dust layer itself. The effect on irradiance due to this dust outbreak was a decrease in upwelling <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radiation</b> {{at the top of the}} atmosphere of 6. 5 Wm 2 and an increase in downwelling <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radiation</b> at the surface of 11. 5 Wm 2.
