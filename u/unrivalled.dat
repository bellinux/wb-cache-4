5|$|HMS <b>Unrivalled</b> (P45) was a U-class {{submarine}} {{built for}} the Royal Navy during World War II. The boat {{has been the only}} ship of the Royal Navy to ever bear the name <b>Unrivalled.</b> Completed in 1942, the boat spent most of the war in the Mediterranean. She sank a number of small merchant ships and naval auxiliaries, but major success eluded her during the war. Too small and slow for the post-war environment, <b>Unrivalled</b> was scrapped in 1946.|$|E
5|$|HMS <b>Unrivalled</b> {{was ordered}} on 23 August 1940 {{as part of}} the 1940 naval {{construction}} programme from Vickers-Armstrong at Barrow-in-Furness. She was laid down on 12 May 1941, launched on 16 February 1942 and commissioned on 3 May 1942.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 {{discovery}} in Scotland of a 4000-year-old tomb with burial treasures at Forteviot, near Perth, {{the capital of}} a Pictish Kingdom in the 8th and 9th centuries AD, is <b>unrivalled</b> anywhere in Britain. It contains the remains of an early Bronze Age ruler laid out on white quartz pebbles and birch bark. It was also discovered {{for the first time}} that early Bronze Age people placed flowers in their graves.|$|E
5|$|All {{thirteen}} known Ruisdael etchings {{come from}} his early period, {{with the first}} one dated 1646. It is unknown who taught him the art of etching. No etchings exist signed by his father, his uncle, or his fellow Haarlem landscapist Cornelis Vroom, who influenced his other work. His etchings show little influence from Rembrandt, either in style or technique. Few original impressions exist; five etchings survive in only a single impression. The rarity of prints suggests that Ruisdael considered them trial essays, which did not warrant large editions. The etching expert Georges Duplessis singled out Grainfield at the Edge of a Wood and The Travellers as <b>unrivalled</b> illustrations of Ruisdael's genius.|$|E
5|$|In 1929 Harcourt Williams, newly {{appointed}} {{as director of}} productions at the Old Vic, invited Gielgud to join the company for the forthcoming season. The Old Vic, in an unfashionable area of London south of the Thames, was run by Lilian Baylis to offer plays and operas to a mostly working-class audience at low ticket prices. She paid her performers very modest wages, but the theatre was known for its <b>unrivalled</b> repertory of classics, mostly Shakespeare, and Gielgud {{was not the first}} West End star to take a large pay cut to work there. It was, in Morley's words, the place to learn Shakespearean technique and try new ideas.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{evolutionary}} theory continues to develop. Darwin's {{theory of evolution}} by natural selection, with its tree-like model of branching common descent, has become the unifying theory of the life sciences. The theory explains the diversity of living organisms and their adaptation to the environment. It makes sense of the geologic record, biogeography, parallels in embryonic development, biological homologies, vestigiality, cladistics, phylogenetics and other fields, with <b>unrivalled</b> explanatory power; it has also become essential to applied sciences such as medicine and agriculture. Despite the scientific consensus, a religion-based political controversy has developed over how evolution is taught in schools, especially in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Apart from a work-up {{patrol in}} the Norwegian Sea, {{she spent the}} bulk of the war in the Mediterranean. While working up, <b>Unrivalled</b> fired a torpedo at what was thought to be a {{submerged}} enemy submarine. Only the periscope was sighted, and the torpedo was fired in the direction detected by the hydrophones, but no German submarine was in the area. Whilst in service in the Mediterranean, she sank a number of small merchantmen and small naval auxiliary vessels with both torpedoes and gunfire. These included the Italian auxiliary submarine chaser O 97 / Margherita, the Italian merchants Maddalena, Mostaganem and Pasubio, the Italian tugs Genova and Iseo, the Italian sailing vessels Triglav, Albina, Margherita, Sparviero and Ardito, the German auxiliary submarine chasers UJ 2201/Bois Rose and UJ 2204/Boréal, the Italian tanker Bivona, the small Italian merchant Santa Mariana Salina, the Italian auxiliary minesweeper R 172 / Impero and the small Italian vessel San Francisco di Paola A.|$|E
5|$|In {{a review}} for Times Higher Education, Jack Harris says that Walker is an {{extremely}} good writer and even {{those who do not}} specialise in technical fields will derive enjoyment from the book. According to Harris, Walker has unique experience as historian to the NRC which has placed him in an <b>unrivalled</b> position to tell the TMI story. But Harris identifies some omissions in the book. There is little on the other two major nuclear that threatened large civilian populations: the Windscale fire (UK, October 1957), and the Chernobyl disaster (Ukraine, April 1986). Harris states that Windscale threw up similar problems to TMI, particularly relating to whether large-scale evacuations should have been initiated, but he could find no reference to the Windscale accident in the book's index which is surprising in a book that aims to put TMI in historical perspective.|$|E
5|$|The FN {{was hurt}} in the snap 1988 {{legislative}} elections by the return two-ballot majority voting, by the limited campaign period, and by the departure of many notables. In the election the party retained its 9.8% support from the previous legislative election, but {{was reduced to a}} single seat in the National Assembly. Following some anti-Semitic comments made by Le Pen and the FN newspaper National Hebdo in the late 1980s, some valuable FN politicians left the party. Other quarrels soon also left the party without its remaining member of the National Assembly. In November 1988, general secretary Jean-Pierre Stirbois, who, together with his wife Marie-France, had been instrumental in the FN's early electoral successes, died in a car accident, leaving Bruno Mégret as the <b>unrivalled</b> de facto FN deputy leader. The FN only got 5% in the 1988 cantonal elections, while the RPR announced it would reject any alliance with the FN, now including at local level. In the 1989 European elections, the FN held on to its ten seats as it won 11.7% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|The economy {{continued}} in muted form. The three main establishment families on the island, the Moodys, the Sealys, and Kempners, had essentially <b>unrivalled</b> {{control of the}} island. The Splash Day celebrations restarted, drawing tourists to the coast. Many hotels, banks, and some insurance companies remained as did the medical and nursing schools, {{as well as the}} hospitals. Efforts at historical preservation (notably including those of George P. Mitchell) gradually helped to re-establish the island's tourism industry, though in a very different form from the past. Nonbinding referenda were put forward in the 1980s regarding legalization of casinos in the city but were defeated by the voters each time, demonstrating the changes in the city since the bygone era. However informal polls in 2008 and 2010 indicate this sentiment may be changing. Indeed gambling aboard cruise ships leaving from Galveston is now commonplace.|$|E
5|$|The first geared {{clock was}} invented in the 11th century by the Arab {{engineer}} Ibn Khalaf al-Muradi in Islamic Iberia; it was a water clock that employed a complex gear train mechanism, including both segmental and epicyclic gearing, capable of transmitting high torque. The clock was <b>unrivalled</b> in its use of sophisticated complex gearing, until the mechanical clocks of the mid-14th century. Al-Muradi's clock also employed the use of mercury in its hydraulic linkages, which could function mechanical automata. Al-Muradi's work was known to scholars working under Alfonso X of Castile, hence the mechanism {{may have played a}} role in the development of the European mechanical clocks. Other monumental water clocks constructed by medieval Muslim engineers also employed complex gear trains and arrays of automata. Like the earlier Greeks and Chinese, Arab engineers at the time also developed a liquid-driven escapement mechanism which they employed in some of their water clocks. Heavy floats were used as weights and a constant-head system was used as an escapement mechanism, which was present in the hydraulic controls they used to make heavy floats descend at a slow and steady rate.|$|E

25|$|Since 2000, the Rauhe/Wieskötter {{partnership}} {{has enjoyed}} <b>unrivalled</b> success, winning the major K-2 500 m race from 2001 to 2007 (six world titles and the 2004 Olympic gold). The pair have also won eight straight European championships over 500 m (2000-2008; {{there was no}} championship in 2003).|$|E
25|$|With {{the success}} of Radio Singapura another key player in the {{broadcasting}} industry in the pre-independence Singapore, Rediffusion Singapore, introduced cable broadcasting service to Singapore in 1949. Rediffusion Singapore brought radio to housing areas which lacked decent radio reception with <b>unrivalled</b> sound quality compared to the conventional radio technologies at that time.|$|E
25|$|The {{corporation}} {{was growing}} globally, {{but it was}} heavily focused in North America. And though its oil and gas activity was concentrated in the US southwest and in western Canada, its marketing presence was strongest in middle America. From its Chicago base, the corporation had <b>unrivalled</b> intelligence about hydrocarbon demand in the US Midwest.|$|E
25|$|Besides, McDuffie {{was a good}} hitter, swift baserunner and <b>unrivalled</b> self-promoter. But {{he often}} got more {{attention}} for his handsome looks, flashy dress, gold jewelries, flamboyant behavior and bevy of girlfriends than for his ball playing. A crowd pleaser, he was known for wearing a jacket with the words The Great McDuffie emblazoned on the back in large letters.|$|E
25|$|When {{it comes}} to trade in {{intellectual}} property, the United States remains <b>unrivalled.</b> Income from royalties and licensing amounted to $129.2 billion in 2013, {{the highest in the}} world. Japan comes a distant second, with receipts of $31.6 billion in 2013. The United States' payments for use of intellectual property amounted to $39.0 billion in 2013, exceeded only by Ireland ($46.4 billion).|$|E
25|$|The Selous Scouts were racial-integrated unit (approx. 70% black soldiers) which {{conducted}} {{a highly successful}} clandestine war against the guerrillas by posing as guerrillas themselves.

25|$|Cassiopeia is a {{constellation}} {{in the northern}} sky, named after the vain queen Cassiopeia in Greek mythology, who boasted about her <b>unrivalled</b> beauty. Cassiopeia {{was one of the}} 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century Greek astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations today. It is easily recognizable due to its distinctive 'W' shape, formed by five bright stars. It is opposite the Big Dipper.|$|E
25|$|Since then a {{great variety}} of {{purchases}} have been made. During the 19th century the works were almost exclusively by Danish artists, and for this reason the Museum has an <b>unrivalled</b> collection of paintings from the so-called Danish Golden Age. That the country was able to produce pictures of high artistic quality was something new, and a consequence of the establishment of the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 1754.|$|E

25|$|Some of {{the medical}} students, {{including}} William A. F. Browne (1805–1885), responded very positively to this materialist conception {{of the nervous system}} and, by implication, of mental disorder. George Combe (1788–1858), an Edinburgh solicitor, became an <b>unrivalled</b> exponent of phrenological thinking, and his brother, Andrew Combe (1797–1847), who was later appointed a physician to Queen Victoria, wrote a phrenological treatise entitled Observations on Mental Derangement (1831). They also founded the Edinburgh Phrenological Society in 1820.|$|E
25|$|He {{was educated}} in Hispania, {{a part of}} the Roman Empire which in the 1st century {{produced}} several notable Latin writers, including Seneca the Elder and Seneca the Younger, Lucan and Quintilian, and Martial's contemporaries Licinianus of Bilbilis, Decianus of Emerita and Canius of Gades. Martial professes to be of the school of Catullus, Pedo, and Marsus. The epigram bears to this day the form impressed upon it by his <b>unrivalled</b> skill in wordsmithing.|$|E
25|$|She {{highlights}} the early fast passenger-carrying and general cargo trade to the Antipodes. Her composite construction illustrates technical development in 19th shipbuilding techniques and scientific progress in metallurgy and her self-reefing top sails demonstrate {{the beginnings of}} modern labour saving technologies. Her service on the London to Adelaide route between 1864 and 1888 gives her an <b>unrivalled</b> associate status {{as one of the}} ships contributing to the growth of the Australian nation.|$|E
25|$|Mixed {{feelings}} {{must have}} been strongly expressed by the Thanet boatmen in general, as the <b>unrivalled</b> speed of the steam packet was outmanoeuvring all other classes of vessel, but it brought a new prosperity to Thanet. In {{the middle of the}} 19th century, the professional classes began to move in. By 1850, the population had reached about 3,000, doubling over the previous 50years. Due to the fresh sea air, many convalescent homes for children opened {{towards the end of the}} 19th century.|$|E
25|$|In {{their aim}} to {{establish}} <b>unrivalled</b> territorial control, the Bremen Cathedral Chapter, led by its then Provost Gerard of Lippe, besides fulfilling religious tasks of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bremen also wielding the secular {{rule in the}} much smaller Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen, together with the prince-archbishop of Bremen, then Gerard's sick granduncle , since 1251 represented by Coadjutor , Prince-Bishop of Paderborn, being Gerard's uncle and Gebhard's nephew, managed to integrate the Porta Coeli convent and its holdings as a temporality within the prince-archiepiscopal sovereign territory.|$|E
25|$|This {{striving for}} {{perfection}} is very {{evident in his}} portrait drawings, where he searches with his brush {{for just the right}} line for the sitter's profile. The critical faculty in making this choice and his perception of its potency in communicating decisively the sitter's character is a true measure of Holbein's supreme greatness as a portrait painter. Nobody has ever surpassed the revealing profile and stance in his portraits: through their telling use, Holbein still conveys across the centuries the character and likeness of his sitters with an <b>unrivalled</b> mastery.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of his career, Stewart was a {{specialist}} opening batsman for England, with wicketkeeping duties being retained by Jack Russell, who was generally recognised as the superior gloveman and who batted down the order. However, Russell, the inferior batsman, would often be dropped to improve the balance of the side (i.e. to accommodate an extra bowler or batsman), in which case Stewart would don the gloves. After enduring years of selection and deselection, Russell retired from international cricket in 1998, leaving Stewart <b>unrivalled</b> as England's keeper-batsman until his own retirement in 2003.|$|E
25|$|These {{achievements}} granted him unmatched {{military power}} {{and threatened to}} eclipse the standing of Pompey, who had realigned himself with the Senate {{after the death of}} Crassus in 53BC. With the Gallic Wars concluded, the Senate ordered Caesar to step down from his military command and return to Rome. Caesar refused the order and instead marked his defiance in 49BC by crossing the Rubicon with the 13th Legion, leaving his province and illegally entering Roman Italy under arms. Civil war resulted and Caesar's victory in the war put him in an <b>unrivalled</b> position of power and influence.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the end of}} the {{war with}} Spain in 1648 enabled the VOC to greatly expand its empire by {{military}} means, and to hold European competitors at bay in the same manner (a fortress was built at the strategic Cape of Good Hope in 1653), it did not completely rely on force of arms for its commercial dominance. In Bengal, and the intra-Indian trade, for instance, the Dutch dominated at first by commercial means, consistently out-trading the English in commodities such as silk, rice, and opium, destined for other Asian markets. In these years the scale of the Dutch intra-Asian trade went <b>unrivalled.</b>|$|E
25|$|Remarkably, {{when the}} sizzling, dry weather returned, Warwickshire, with Foster and Frank Field making <b>unrivalled</b> use of {{extremely}} fast wickets, won match after match – only {{stopped by a}} few draws due to heavy scoring – to claim the Championship. In this period, Foster scored 200 against Surrey and 105 in an hour against Yorkshire, and achieved such bowling feats as 11 for 73 at Northampton in the final match. For the whole season, Foster headed both batting and bowling averages for his county, {{and it was no}} surprise when he went to Australia for the 1911/1912 Ashes tour.|$|E
25|$|In Australasia, {{the game}} centred around local, {{regional}} or statewide leagues, {{and there were}} no national competitions in either country until late in the 20th century. In both Australia and New Zealand, club championships were based on one set of home and away matches leading to a play-off, rather than the multiplicity of trophies available to British clubs. Rugby league quickly took over from rugby union as the most popular form of football in New South Wales and Queensland. The rest of the country was already dominated by Australian rules football. The amateur code still held sway in New Zealand, although the emergence of rugby league meant that it was no longer <b>unrivalled</b> in popularity.|$|E
25|$|The {{record for}} the {{youngest}} athlete {{to participate in the}} Olympic 100m is held by Katura Marae, who was 14 when she represented Vanuatu at the 2004 Athens Olympics. Merlene Ottey holds the records for both the oldest participant and the oldest medallist, having won bronze at age 40 in 2000 and reached the Olympic semi-finals four years later. (Ottey is also the most frequent participant having competed in the Olympic 100m an <b>unrivalled</b> six times from 1984 to 2004). The first women's champion, Betty Robinson in 1928, remains the youngest gold medallist for the event at 16 years old, while a 32-year-old Linford Christie became the oldest 100m Olympic champion in 1992.|$|E
