Moments before the contest, Hart revealed that his knee injury was fake. During the contest, referee Earl Hebner became tied <b>upside</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the ropes after being distracted by Shinja. While Hebner was tied upside down, Hakushi interfered and performed a diving headbutt to Hart. Lawler won the match when he rolled-up Hart for the pinfall.|$|E
5|$|The male wanders as {{an adult}} and in August or September goes looking for the females' webs to mate. The male will enter the female's web and vibrate the silk as he {{approaches}} her. The female is usually aggressive at first and will chase the male from the web. The Courtship process consists of the male bobbing, plucking and tweaking the web along with periods of cautious approach and being chased by the female. Eventually, when she becomes docile and allows him to approach, the male will then approach the female as she hangs quietly <b>upside</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the web. The male moves onto her ventral abdomen, tapping her rapidly until she moves to align his abdomen above hers. He then inserts his palps one at a time, leaving the female between each insertion. Copulation occurs over 10 to 30 minutes. After mating, the male retreats to groom, which is performed by running his palps and legs through his fangs and wiping them over his body. The male is not eaten by the female unlike some other widow spiders.|$|E

25|$|A router may {{be mounted}} <b>upside</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> a router table or bench.

This allows the work to be passed over the router, rather than passing the router over the work. This has benefits when working with smaller objects and makes some router operations safer to execute. A router table may be fitted with a fence, fingerboards and other work-guiding accessories to make the operation safer and more accurate.|$|E
25|$|In the end, about 25 {{people were}} on board when {{it left the}} deck {{under the command of}} Quartermaster Arthur Bright.

Several other Polaroid images depicted as-yet unidentified young men, and several detectives were assigned the task of identifying each individual depicted to determine if he was alive or dead, and if alive, the circumstances surrounding his depiction. As several of these images depicted a section of the body of the individual who had taken the photograph, on April 13, Berdella was ordered to pose nude for a series of photographs in order that portions of his body could be photographed in the precise angle depicted within these images for comparison with the original Polaroid images.|$|E

25|$|Many {{collectors}} long {{thought the}} blue plane portion was printed first, {{thus it was}} actually the red frames that were inverted. However, research by noted philatelic authors Henry Goodkind and George Amick shows this to be incorrect; in fact, the frames were printed first {{and it is the}} planes that are <b>upside</b> <b>down.</b> <b>In</b> examples where the plane is so far off center that it overlaps the frames, {{it can be seen that}} the blue ink used to print the plane lies atop the red ink used to print the frames. The Smithsonian's National Postal Museum offers two explanations for how this might have occurred: either a sheet of printed frames was placed in the press upside down for the printing of the plane; or the printing plate used to print the planes was mounted inverted within the printing press.|$|E
25|$|By mid-2011, the Indian cricket {{team was}} enjoying {{unprecedented}} success, winning the 2011 Cricket World Cup held at home, while also being the No. 1 Test team, {{which they had}} achieved in 2009. They proved to be undefeatable at home as always, but also enjoyed success away, especially beyond the subcontinent such as in South Africa in late 2010, where {{for the first time}} ever, the Indian cricket team did not lose a Test series there. The team, led by wicketkeeper-batsman Mahendra Singh Dhoni, was widely praised by media and former cricketers, and Dhoni's captaincy was also considered by some experts {{to be one of the}} reasons for India's success. However, this success was turned <b>upside</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> their tour to England in 2011. It was widely expected that India would win the Test and ODI series there, by light of their recent success. However, their weaknesses in their bowling and batting were completely exposed by the Englishmen and they lost all the 4 Tests, losing their No. 1 Test status to England. Despite the debacle in England, it was widely expected that India would retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy after the series in Australia, as the team's previous 2 tours Down Under were ok with achieving 2 test victories and that the Australian cricket team was now quite weak. Also the nucleus of the Indian side selected for the tour had a number of players who had a good record in Australia. India had most recently won a five-match ODI home series against England 5–0 in October and a three-Test home series against the West Indies 2–0 in November, further improving expectations.|$|E

In 1876, the relatives of the men lost on Tecumseh petitioned Congress to stop the salvage. Congress quickly passed Joint Resolution No. 23 on 15 August directing the Secretary of the Treasury to return the $50 to Slaughter, with 6% interest. The Secretary of the Navy was to assume control of the wreck and was empowered to protect Tecumseh. Congress stipulated that any salvage efforts must provide for the proper removal and burial of the vessel's dead crewmen.|$|E

500|$|On 3 September 1944, Emil Lang {{was killed}} in action when his Fw 190 A-8 (Werknummer 171 240—factory number) [...] "Green 1" [...] hit the ground and {{exploded}} in a field at Overhespen. He had experienced mechanical trouble on the runway when {{he and the other}} aircraft of his flight took off at Melsbroek at 1.20 pm. Ten minutes later, Lang was still having difficulties raising his landing gear. Flying at an altitude of , his wingman, Unteroffizier Hans-Joachim Borreck, called out P-47 Thunderbolts to their rear. Lang broke upward, to the left. Leutnant Alfred Groß saw Lang's Fw190 diving in flames, its gear extended, but he lost sight of Lang when his own craft was hit and he had to bail out. Examination of both German and American records suggests that Borreck and Groß misidentified their opponents. The P-51 Mustangs of the 55th Fighter Group's 338th Squadron intercepted a flight of three to six Focke Wulfs. Lieutenant Darrell Cramer took a high deflection shot at the Focke Wulf on the left, which fell <b>upside</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> a steep dive and crashed hard into the ground; this undoubtedly was Emil Lang.|$|E
500|$|At 10:18p.m., {{witnesses}} reported {{hearing a}} noise described as [...] "a metallic sound and rending timbers, such as {{made by a}} falling boom." [...] Immediately afterward, an explosion occurred on the pier and a fire started. Five to seven seconds later a more powerful explosion took place as {{the majority of the}} ordnance within and near the SS E. A. Bryan detonated in a fireball seen for miles. An Army Air Forces pilot flying in the area reported that the fireball was [...] in diameter. Chunks of glowing hot metal and burning ordnance were flung over [...] into the air. The E. A. Bryan was completely destroyed and the Quinault was blown out of the water, torn into sections and thrown in several directions; the stern landed <b>upside</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the water [...] away. The Coast Guard fire boat CG-60014-F was thrown [...] upriver, where it sank. The pier, along with its boxcars, locomotive, rails, cargo, and men, was blasted into pieces. Nearby boxcarswaiting within their revetments to be unloaded at midnightwere bent inward and crumpled by the force of the shock. The port's barracks and other buildings and much of the surrounding town were severely damaged. Shattering glass and a rain of jagged metal and undetonated munitions caused many more injuries among military personnel and civilians, although no one outside the immediate pier area was killed. Nearly $9.9million worth of damage ($million in [...] ) was caused to U.S. government property. Seismographs at the University of California, Berkeley sensed the two shock waves traveling through the ground, determining the second, larger event to be equivalent to an earthquake measuring 3.4 on the Richter magnitude scale.|$|E
