40|$|The {{effect of}} a condensed-phase {{environment}} on the ultraviolet-visible (<b>UV-vis)</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra</b> of chromophores is of fundamental interest in many phenomena, such as color tuning in photobiology and the solvatochromic shift in chemistry. The experimental measurement of <b>UV-vis</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra</b> can provide {{the information on the}} spectral region of the absorption of the sample. While computer simulation of the <b>UV-vis</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra</b> can provide the microscopic interpretation of the absorption bands. Moreover, computer simulations can be done for the cases that are impractical for experimental measurements. This thesis work aims to develop proper computational strategies to calculate the <b>UV-vis</b> <b>absorption</b> of organic chromophores in a condensed-phase environment, and to interpret the experimental results or to tackle problems that are difficult for experimental approaches. Simulation of the <b>UV-vis</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra</b> typically involves modeling {{of the structure of the}} target system and the calculation of its vertical electronic excitation energies and oscillator strengths of the interesting part of the system. The large size of the condensed phase makes both parts of the simulation very challenging. In this thesis work, frozen-density embedding theory, one of the appropriate approaches on the market for tackling large systems, combined with linear-response time-dependent density-functional theory, is used to calculate the vertical electronic excitation energies and the oscillator strengths of the chromophores in condensed phases.

The <b>UV-vis</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrum</b> of catechin shows a very sharp and strong absorption maximum peak at 275 nm in deaerated water. New absorption maximum peaks appeared in aerated water, as well as in basic aqueous solution, caused by the oxidation of catechin. The absorbances in the <b>UV-vis</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrum</b> of catechin decreased when the solution was left in the dark for a long time. The fluorescence emission spectrum of catechin after a long time period differs markedly from that in freshly prepared solution; the fluorescence maxia shifted as time passes after adding catechin to the solutions.
