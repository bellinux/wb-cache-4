Tom Savini's initial design has been the basis {{for many of the}} later incarnations. The trademark hockey goalie mask did not appear <b>until</b> <b>Friday</b> the 13th PartIII. Since , filmmakers have given Jason superhuman strength, regenerative powers, and near invulnerability. He has been seen as a sympathetic character, whose motivation for killing has been cited as being driven by the immoral actions of his victims and his own rage over having drowned as a child. Jason Voorhees has been featured in various humor magazines, referenced in feature films, parodied in television shows, and was the inspiration for a horror punk band. Several toy lines have been released based on various versions of the character from the Friday the 13th films. Jason Voorhees's hockey mask is a widely recognized image in popular culture.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} 2005, Koeberg started {{experiencing}} numerous technical difficulties. On 11 November 2005, a fault on {{a transmission}} busbar caused the reactor to go into safe mode, cutting supply {{to most of the}} Western Cape for about two hours. On 16 November a fire under a 400 kV transmission line caused the line to trip, causing severe voltage dips which resulted in Koeberg once again shutting down. Various parts of the Cape were left without electricity for hours at a time. On the evening of 23 November, a routine inspection of the backup safety system revealed a below-spec concentration of an important chemical, resulting in a controlled shutdown of the reactor. Due to the sufficiency of backup supply, major power cuts were not experienced <b>until</b> <b>Friday</b> 25 November, when the backup capacity began running out. At this point, rotational load shedding was employed, with customers being switched off in stages for most of the day. Koeberg was re-synchronised to the national grid on Saturday 26 November.|$|E

The news of Grace Kelly's engagement to Prince Rainier of Monaco broke at the Stork. The couple was at the club on Tuesday, January 3, 1956, as the rumors flew. Veteran columnist Jack O'Brian passed Kelly a note, saying that reliable sources indicated she was about to become engaged to the Prince. [...] Kelly replied she could not answer the question posed by O'Brian <b>until</b> <b>Friday.</b> Socialite Evalyn Walsh McLean, owner of the Hope Diamond, wore the gem as if it was costume jewelry.

500|$|On December 20, 2014, {{the album}} was made {{available}} for pre-order at the iTunes Store. When ordered, six tracks (five in the United Kingdom) were automatically downloaded. Madonna stated that the songs {{were meant to be}} [...] "an early Christmas gift" [...] with the final release on March 10, 2015. Originally, [...] "Living for Love" [...] was intended to serve as the lead single from the album. It was to be released on Valentine's Day, {{with the rest of the}} record slated for the spring. However, due to the leak, the release date had to be pushed up. Oseary recalled that they did not receive a confirmation <b>until</b> <b>Friday</b> night whether the pre-release could be executed, since iTunes was closing for the Christmas weekend. After much discussion on the pros and cons of the release, and with the aid of Interscope vice-chairman Steve Berman, and Apple Inc.'s Robert Kondrk, they were able to go live slowly. The six songs Madonna chose had to be polished, and since the tracks' producers were unavailable, she mastered and mixed them herself. The album's release was compared to Beyoncé's self-titled surprise release in 2013, with The Guardian calling it a [...] "partial Beyoncé". The leaks continued with fourteen new demos being revealed between December 23 and December 27. Three new tracks—"Hold Tight", [...] "Joan of Arc" [...] and [...] "Iconic"—became available following Madonna's Grammy performance.|$|E

Settlement procedures were unsophisticated, with banks settling their accounts by employing porters to travel from bank to bank to exchange checks for bags of coin, or “specie.” As the number of banks grew, exchanges became a daily event. The official reckoning of accounts, however, {{did not take place}} <b>until</b> <b>Fridays,</b> often resulting in record keeping errors and encouraging abuses.
