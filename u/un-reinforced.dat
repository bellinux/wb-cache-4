2500|$|Due to a {{widespread}} practice by insurers to indemnify San Francisco properties from fire, but not earthquake damage, {{most of the}} destruction in the city was blamed on the fires. Some property owners deliberately set fire to damaged properties in order to claim them on their insurance. Capt. Leonard D. Wildman of the U.S. Army Signal Corps reported that he [...] "was stopped by a fireman {{who told me that}} people in that neighborhood were firing their houses… they were told that they would not get their insurance on buildings damaged by the earthquake unless they were damaged by fire. The insurance industry eventually paid out over $250,000,000 (the largest amount they paid out for the next 60 years) which significantly helped to rebuild the city." [...] Building standards of the original 1906 buildings had almost no earthquake resistance built in. Since 1906 earthquake standards have been steadily upgraded as damages caused by earthquakes are investigated. Unfortunately, a lot of older buildings do not meet today's standards, and it would typically cost too much to upgrade them. It was discovered in 1906 (again) that all masonry-type structures built of brick and <b>un-reinforced</b> concrete are resistance to fire but not earthquakes. A detailed analysis of the city of San Francisco today estimates that an earthquake over 7.0 magnitude would completely destroy or seriously damage many sections of San Francisco and could possibly result in thousands of deaths. Today in most communities, structures built to later earthquake standards would do well in all but the strongest earthquakes. The water mains and other infrastructure needed for fighting fires have all been upgraded but are yet untested.|$|E

50|$|The {{bridge at}} Gairloch, which pre-dates the Lamington Bridge by five years, {{demonstrates}} {{one of the}} earliest uses of concrete in bridge construction in Queensland. Prior to the introduction of reinforced concrete to Australia in the 1890s, concrete as a component of bridges took the form of <b>un-reinforced</b> abutments, piers and mass concrete culverts, the earliest known being railway culverts constructed in South Australia in 1878. In 1882, concrete culverts were used on the Warwick-to-Stanthorpe railway line in Queensland. The original bridge across the railway in Edward Street Brisbane, designed by FDG Stanley in 1887 had concrete abutments. The concrete piers and abutments of the Gairloch Bridge, designed in 1889, are among the earliest known in Queensland. From , the greater availability of locally made Portland cement made the use of this material in bridge construction much more common.|$|E

40|$|Full-scale shake table seismic {{experiments}} and low amplitude vibration tests on a masonry building {{are carried out}} to assess its seismic performance as well as study {{the effectiveness of a}} new textile material for retrofitting masonry structures against earthquakes. The <b>un-reinforced</b> and the retrofitted with glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) strips masonry buildings were subjected to a series of earthquake excitations of increasing magnitude in or-der to progressively induce various small, moderate and severe levels of damage to the ma-sonry walls. The performance of the original and retrofitted building states is evaluated. Changes in the dynamic characteristics (lowest four modal frequencies and damping ratios) of the building are used to assess and quantify the damage states of the masonry walls. For this, the dynamic modal characteristics of the structure states after each earthquake event were estimated by performing low-amplitude impulse hammer and sine-sweep forced vibration tests. The retrofitting actions restored the stiffness characteristics of the reinforced masonry structure to the levels of the original undamaged <b>un-reinforced</b> structure. The results show that the despite a similar dynamic behavior identified, corresponding to reduction of the modal frequencies, the <b>un-reinforced</b> masonry building was severely damaged, while the rein-forced masonry building was able to withstand, without visual damage, the induced strong seismic excitations. The GFRP textile material, optimally wrapped along the masonry walls following existing guidelines, was proven to be very effective in reinforcing the masonry building to withstand earthquake events significantly larger in magnitude than the ones caused severe damage to the <b>un-reinforced</b> building...|$|E

A total of seven different schemes were considered in the study. An 860 × 860 mm air bag with 70 tons capacity was used to apply a uniform out-of plane lateral load on the walls. The test results show that GFRP schemes have major influence on the out-of-plane response of the walls. The variation in the flexural capacity of the tested brick wall due to the change in the GFRP schemes was up to 60 % of the reference specimen. The corresponding variations in the out-of-plane deflection and the surface strain were 64 % and 40 %, respectively. The results also show that the variation in the flexural capacity of the block walls was up to 56 %.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Un-reinforced</b> masonry {{buildings}} {{are a major}} population of residential and school buildings in Iran which have been shown severe damages during past earthquakes e. g.

This kind of construction is not (or rarely) used anymore in urban regions. However, any effort for the seismic rehabilitation of the current buildings can save a reasonable amount of life in a future earthquake. That is, a detailed seismic rehabilitation for a typical <b>un-reinforced</b> masonry building in Iran has been described in this paper. The reha-bilitation methodology is based on the ASCE 41 - 06 standard recommendations but adopted in details for the Iranian traditional masonry construction type.
