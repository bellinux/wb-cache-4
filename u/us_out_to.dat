500|$|Olsson's main {{argument}} in the debate {{leading up to the}} day of the referendum was that foreigners {{would not be able to}} fit into a community such as Sjöbo. He repeatedly stated that these people come from [...] "unknown cultures" [...] and that it would be impossible for them to integrate into the Swedish society. Per-Ingvar Magnusson, the then-chairman of the Sjöbo branch of the Center Party, stated to the media that the referendum had nothing to do with racism; he claimed that the reason for the vote was that Sjöbo lacked housing and jobs. He said in an interview that he was surprised by the attention the town had received in the media: [...] "They make <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be stupid, fools, farmers who live in isolation. The town simply wants to take care of its own first." ...|$|E

500|$|He {{was elected}} {{as a member}} of the European Parliament for North West England in the 2009 European Elections. The BNP polled 943,598votes (6.2%), gaining two MEPs. Griffin and fellow MEP Andrew Brons were {{subsequently}} pelted with eggs as they attempted to stage a celebratory press conference outside the Houses of Parliament. A second venue– a public house near Manchester– was chosen the following day. A line of police blocked a large group of protesters, who chanted [...] "No platform for Nazi Nick" [...] and [...] "Nazi scum off our streets". Griffin viewed the election as an important victory, claiming that his party had been demonised and blocked from holding public meetings. [...] "In Oldham alone there have been hundreds of thousands of pounds spent on employing bogus community workers to keep <b>us</b> <b>out.</b> <b>To</b> triumph against that level of pressure as a political party has never been done before." ...|$|E
