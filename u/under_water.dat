5|$|Fish are {{captured}} by cornering them in shallow water, usually against the bank or under logs.

5|$|Hippopotamuses {{appear to}} {{communicate}} vocally, through grunts and bellows, {{and they may}} practice echolocation, but {{the purpose of these}} vocalizations is currently unknown. Hippos have the unique ability to hold their heads partially above the water and send out a cry that travels through both water and air; individuals respond above and <b>under</b> <b>water.</b> Hippos will also express threat and alarm with exhalations.|$|E
40|$|Stress and {{deformation}} {{of the rock}} masses around the mine seam induced by mining can affect the water system and the aquifuge within the mining fields region and then often causes coal mine water hazards during mining <b>under</b> <b>waters.</b> In this study, based on the geological and hydrogeological condition of the mining fields and considering the water flowing fracture zone and the caving zone, fine model describing the rock structures, rock properties and effects of mining activities is established. The groundwater seepage evolution is analyzed after mining and the water inrush is forecasted on roof of working faces, adopting the seepage mechanics theory. According to the water inrush forecasting results in different mining depth, the safely mining depth <b>under</b> <b>waters</b> is decided. The research results indicate that strip-partial mining with coal pillars in coal seams <b>under</b> the <b>waters</b> is effective method during mining <b>under</b> <b>waters</b> and after mining to a certain depth, the coal seam can be mined fully safely. The study provides a theoretical basis and practical guidance for decision-making of “three-underground” mining, coal mine water hazards prediction and prevention...|$|R

5|$|Nests may be {{protected}} from physical threats such as flooding and overheating by elaborate nest architecture. Workers of Cataulacus muticus, an arboreal species that lives in plant hollows, respond to flooding by drinking water inside the nest, and excreting it outside.

5|$|The {{cetaceans}} (whales, dolphins and porpoises) are {{marine mammal}} descendants of land mammals. The pakicetids are an extinct family of hoofed mammals {{that are the}} earliest whales, whose closest sister group is Indohyus from family Raoellidae. They lived in the Early Eocene, around 53 million years ago. Their fossils were first discovered in North Pakistan in 1979, at a river {{not far from the}} shores of the former Tethys Sea. Pakicetids could hear <b>under</b> <b>water,</b> using enhanced bone conduction, rather than depending on tympanic membranes like most land mammals. This arrangement does not give directional hearing <b>under</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
5|$|A delayed or {{deployable}} surface {{marker buoy}} (DSMB) is a soft inflatable tube which {{is attached to}} a reel or spool line at one end, and is inflated by the diver <b>under</b> <b>water</b> and released to float to the surface, deploying the line as it ascends. This provides information to the surface that the diver is about to ascend, and where he is. This equipment is commonly used by recreational and technical divers, and requires a certain level of skill to operate safely. They are mostly used to signal the boat that the diver has started ascent or to indicate a problem in technical diving.|$|E

5|$|Although {{paleontology}} became established around 1800, earlier thinkers {{had noticed}} {{aspects of the}} fossil record. The ancient Greek philosopher Xenophanes (570–480 BC) concluded from fossil sea shells that some areas of land were once <b>under</b> <b>water.</b> During the Middle Ages the Persian naturalist Ibn Sina, known as Avicenna in Europe, discussed fossils and proposed a theory of petrifying fluids on which Albert of Saxony elaborated in the 14th century.

5|$|Dolphins have sharp eyesight. The {{eyes are}} {{located at the}} sides of the head and have a tapetum lucidum, or {{reflecting}} membrane, {{at the back of the}} retina, which aids vision in dim light. Their horseshoe-shaped, double-slit pupils enable dolphins to have good vision both in air and underwater, despite the different indices of refraction of these media. When <b>under</b> <b>water,</b> the eyeball's lens serves to focus light, whereas in the in-air environment, the typically bright light serves to contract the specialized pupil, resulting in sharpness from a smaller aperture (similar to a pinhole camera).|$|E

5|$|Freshwater marl prairies {{are similar}} to sloughs, but lack the slow {{movement}} of surface water; instead, water seeps through a calcitic mud called marl. Algae and other microscopic organisms form periphyton, which attaches to limestone. When it dries {{it turns into a}} gray mud. Sawgrass and other water plants grow shorter in freshwater marl than they do in peat, the other type of soil in the Everglades which is found where water remains present longer throughout the year. Marl prairies are usually <b>under</b> <b>water</b> from three to seven months of the year, whereas sloughs may remain submerged for longer than nine months and sometimes remain <b>under</b> <b>water</b> from one year to the next. Sawgrass may dominate sloughs, creating a monoculture. Other grasses, such as muhly grass (Muhlenbergia filipes) and broad-leafed water plants can be found in marl prairies. Animals living in the freshwater sloughs also inhabit marl prairies. Marl prairies may go dry {{in some parts of the}} year; alligators play a vital role in maintaining life in remote parts of the Everglades by burrowing in the mud during the dry season, creating pools of water where fish and amphibians survive from one year to the next. Alligator holes also attract other animals who congregate to feed on smaller prey. When the region floods again during the wet season, the fish and amphibians who were sustained in the alligator holes then repopulate freshwater marl prairies.|$|E
5|$|Heavy rains in {{association}} with thunderstorms on February 4 to February 6, combined with the melting of snow, caused flooding across parts of Illinois, New York, Kentucky, Indiana and Ohio. Among the areas hardest hit by the flooding rivers and streams were the Miami Valley, areas along the Blanchard River in Findlay and parts of northern Indiana between Indianapolis and north of Fort Wayne along the Tippecanoe, St. Marys and Wabash Rivers.

While often an industrial process, welding may be performed in many different environments, including in open air, <b>under</b> <b>water,</b> and in outer space.

5|$|Muskrats {{spend much}} of their time in the water and are well suited for their semiaquatic life. They can swim <b>under</b> <b>water</b> for 12 to 17 minutes. Their bodies, like those of seals and whales, are less {{sensitive}} to the buildup of carbon dioxide than those of most other mammals. They can close off their ears to keep the water out. Their hind feet are semi-webbed, although in swimming, their tails are their main means of propulsion.|$|E
5|$|Since divers on {{the surface}} after a dive still have excess inert gas in their bodies, any {{subsequent}} dive before this excess is fully eliminated needs to modify the schedule {{to take account of}} the residual gas load from the previous dive.

The total elimination of excess gas may take many hours, and tables will indicate the time at normal pressures that is required, which may be up to 18 hours.|$|E
