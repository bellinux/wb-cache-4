However, if the tunable Fabry-Perot filter is place {{on the end of}} incident fiber, the detected time delay of modulation light is occurred due to the <b>unmatch</b> between the scanning time and light transmission time in the transmission fiber. Consequently, the detected peak wavelength shifts with the length of transmission fiber. Thus, the peak wavelength shift effect of Bragg reflective light transmitted in fiber with different fiber length can be obvious in the demodulator with a prepositive tunable Fabry-Perot filter. The exp eri ment indicates the shift rates of 0. 109 - 0. 126 nm/km increase approximately linearly with the original peak wavelength of 1532. 917 - 1560. 300 nm at the fiber length of 0 - 6 km.

40|$|Object Matching (OM) is {{the problem}} of {{identifying}} pairs of data-objects coming from different sources and representing the same real world object. Several methods have been proposed to solve OM problems, but none of them seems to be at the same time fully automated and very effective. In this paper we present a fundamentally new suite of methods that instead possesses both these abilities. We adopt a statistical approach based on mixture models, which structures an OM process into two consecutive tasks. First, mixture parameters are estimated by fitting the model to observed distance measures between pairs. Then, a probabilistic clustering of the pairs into Matches and <b>Unmatches</b> is obtained by exploiting the fitted model. In particular, we use a mixture model with component densities belonging to the Beta parametric family and we fit it by means of an original perturbation-like technique. Moreover, we solve the clustering problem according to both Maximum Likelihood and Minimum Cost objectives. To accomplish this task, optimal decision rules fulfilling one-to-one matching constraints are searched by a purposefully designed evolutionary algorithm. Notably, our suite of methods is distance-independent {{in the sense that it}} does not rely on any restrictive assumption on the function to be used when comparing data-objects. Even more interestingly, our approach is not confined to record linkage applications but can be applied to match also other kinds of data-objects.

However, none of the available systems {{seems to be at}} the same time fully automated and very effective. In this paper we describe and test a new RL software that, instead, possesses both these abilities: the MAERLIN system. MAERLIN implements a novel suite of methods for RL, based on Mixture Models. Such methods allow our system to obtain accurate and reliable results without relying on domain knowledge, thus not jeopardizing automation. The system adopts a two-component Beta mixture model and finds Maximum Likelihood estimates of mixture parameters by means of an original Perturbative Fitting technique. Then, it obtains a probabilistic clustering of record pairs into Matches and <b>Unmatches</b> by finding optimal classification rules under arbitrary matching constraints through a purposefully designed Evolutionary Algorithm. In this paper, we provide an overview of the MAERLIN system. Then, we describe the RELAIS toolkit, which includes a state-of-the-art implementation of the traditional Fellegi-Sunter method for probabilistic RL. Finally, we provide an extensive experimental analysis comparing MAERLIN to RELAIS. Specifically, we present several experiments on challenging real-world RL instances arising from distinct application domains. The obtained results show the significant effectiveness and robustness of the methods underlying MAERLIN and also reveal interesting findings arising from the aforementioned comparative evaluation...|$|R

Amplification of genomic DNA of 9 samples using RAPD analysis yielded 57 fragment, of which 30 were polymorphic, with an average of 6 polymorphic fragment per primer. Study Design: The data was analysed with SIMQUAL program of NTSYS-pc (Version 2. 02), and similarities between accessions were estimated using the Jaccard’s coefficient calculated as J = A / (N - D), where A is the number of positive matches (that is, presence of band in both samples), D is the number of negative matches (that is, absence of band in both samples) and N is the total sample size including both the number of matches and <b>unmatches.</b> Dendrogram was created from the resultant similarity matrices using the UPGMA method following SAHN function of NTSYS-pc (Version 2. 02). Place and Duration of Study: The study was conducted from September 2014 to March 2015. The analysis of genetic diversity was done in the Biochemistry Laboratory and the Molecular Biology Laboratory of Plant II, Agronomy and Horticulture Faculty of Agriculture Bogor Agricultural University. Methodology: Plant material from West Java, DNA extraction after that primer screening and DNA amplification. Data analysis and Electrophoresis of amplified product. Results: The genetic distance was calculated based on Jaccard’s similarity coefficient using SIMQUAL program in NTSYS-pc software to clarify the genetic relationships. An UPGMA dendrogram was constructed using NYSYSpc 2. 10 software. A clear divergence between the two related species was found from the cluster analysis. Jaccard similarity coefficient of soursop ranged from 0. 451 to 0. 902 which revealed a wide range of genetic identity. Based on this value it was noticed that the relationship between soursop sample was closely. High similarity coefficient of 0. 902 was measured between; the sample GRT 3 with CJR 2 and CJR 3. According to analysis of the Jaccard similarity coefficient, the sample SKB 2 with SKB 1 had low similarity coefficient (0. 451). This indicated that both the accessions were genetically distant.

Realistic parameter states without mutation or population subdivision can generate permanent dynamic polymorphism; however, polymorphism is preserved under wider conditions if mu-tation and/or migration in a metapopulation is present. Other factors favorable to polymorphism include weak selection, "zero-sum " patterns of fitness interaction, fast breeding of parasites, and low rather than high or zero recombination. Hard selection was most protective to polymorphism in large populations, but multiple-infection soft (truncation) selection was more protective in small populations. A protective effect of close linkage may strengthen a polygene storage concept of Mather. It may also help account for cases of ancient transpecific polymorphism involving closely linked complexes of loci, as with the major histocompatibility com-plex and some linkages in plant resistance to pathogens.

In order to meet the requirements of the response time of the pumping construction, based on the existing parameter configuration of the accumulator, with dynamic characteristic equation and gas state equation respectively, the switch time of S tube distribution valve and accumulated pressure differential time of the accumulator is quantitatively calculated, and the parameters of the accumulator is configurated. Compared to the traditional accumulator choice method, namely selecting accumulator according to experience and testing whether the response time of the distribution circuit is reasonable, quantitative calculated parameter configuration of concrete pump accumulator is more accurate, and can fully meet the requirments of pumping construction.

The crucial lines of evidence that point to a major role of oblique tectonics in the structuring of the Northern Apennines are: (1) the plate tectonics framework, that indicates left‐lateral oblique convergence along the Europe/Adria plate margin; (2) the lack of a magmatic arc during the entire pre‐collisional convergent history of the chain (a time span > 45 m. y., from Late Cretaceous to Early Oligocene); (3) the long (20 m. y.) residence time of turbidite sequences in the trench (the “dormant” trench); (4) the multiple source areas of turbidites {{from both sides of the}} basin, and the associated coarse gravity deposits; (5) the opposite vergence of deformations in some oceanic units; (6) the <b>unmatching</b> stratigraphic features, distinct deformation and metamorphic histories between adjacent overthrust oceanic units (Ligurids), here interpreted as tectonostratigraphic terranes.
