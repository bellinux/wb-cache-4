25|$|During the 19th century, {{the city}} was {{transformed}} by immigration, a visionary development proposal called the Commissioners' Plan of 1811 which expanded the city street grid to encompass all of Manhattan, {{and the opening of}} the Erie Canal in 1825, which connected the Atlantic port to the vast agricultural markets of the Midwestern United States and Canada. By 1835, New York City had surpassed Philadelphia as the largest city in the <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> grew as an economic center, first as a result of Alexander Hamilton's policies and practices as the first Secretary of the Treasury.|$|E

25|$|According to the 2010 United States Census, New York City had {{the largest}} {{population}} of self-defined Black residents of any U.S. city, with over 2,000,000 within the city's boundaries, although this number has decreased since 2000. New York City had more Black people than did {{the entire state of}} California until the 1980 United States Census. The Black population consists of immigrants and their descendants from Africa and the Caribbean as well as native-born African-Americans. Many of the city's black residents live in Brooklyn and The Bronx. Several of the city's neighborhoods are historical birthplaces of urban Black culture in America, among them the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bedford–Stuyvesant and Manhattan's Harlem and various sections of Eastern Queens and The Bronx. Bedford-Stuyvesant is considered to have the highest concentration of Black residents in the <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City has the largest population of Black immigrants (at 686,814) and descendants of immigrants from the Caribbean (especially from Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, Guyana, Belize, Grenada, and Haiti), and of sub-Saharan Africans. In a news item of April 3, 2006, however, the New York Times noted {{that for the first time}} since the American Civil War, the recorded African-American population was declining, because of emigration to other regions, a declining African-American birthrate in New York, and decreased immigration of Blacks from the Caribbean and Africa.|$|E
