This study aims to investigate the effect of provenances on some wood properties of the Cariniana legalis. Seedlings of three provenances (Porto Ferreira, Piracicaba and Campinas) were planted in Luiz Antonio-SP using randomized block design with six replicates. After 26 years of planting, eighteen trees, six of each provenance, were felled. The properties studied were basic density and the cellular dimensions. The results revealed that the basic density, fiber length, fiber wall thickness, vessel element length, vessel diameter, <b>uniseriate</b> <b>ray</b> height and width were influenced by the provenances. A good positive relationship was found among the fiber length, fiber wall thickness, vessel element length; vessel diameter and multiseriate ray height with radial position and a negative relation between vessel frequency with the radial position...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{climate change}} is the one of most {{important}} environmental issue. Climate variability can be recorded by tree growing through the growth ring. Growth ring formed by cambial activity were examined in wood anatomy. In Sumatra, there are three ecotypes Pinus merkusii, namely ecotypes Kerinci, Tapanuli, and Aceh which can be distinguished morphologically. This study aims to knowing the wood anatomical characteristics of the three ecotypes and determine the potential as climate indicator. This {{study was conducted in}} October 2014 until June 2015. Sample of Kerinci ecotype was collected in Kerinci Seblat National Park, Tapanuli ecotype in Dolok Sibualbuali Natural Reserve and Aceh ecotype in Gunung Leuser National Park on a height of 130 cm using increment borer and cut on the main stem 5 × 5 cm for anatomical sample. Results from this study indicate that ecotype Kerinci and Tapanuli showed earlywood and latewood boundary exposing the clear growth ring, whereas in Aceh ecotype unclear. Tapanuli ecotype have the thickest tracheid diameter than ecotype Kerinci and Aceh. Ecotypes of Kerinci, Tapanuli, and Aceh has homoceluler and <b>uniseriate</b> <b>ray</b> where Aceh ecotype have the longest ray. Furthermore, Kerinci and Tapanuli ecotype have potential as climate indicator eventhough showed negative correlation, that Tapanuli ecotype show the best result and recommended in dendrochronology study. </p...|$|E

Sixteen stumps were exposed upright in 2007 at their original position. Five stumps were installed in the Ipolytarnóc Fossils Nature Reserve. They are identified in the present paper. The wood of one fossil trunk (No. 1) has been identified as Glyptostroboxylon rudolphii, which represents the wood of Glyptostrobus.

40|$|The wood {{anatomy of}} 16 of the 37 genera within the epacrids (Styphelioideae, Ericaceae s. l.) is {{investigated}} by light and scanning electron microscopy. Several {{features in the}} secondary xylem occur consistently at the tribal level: arrangement of vessel-ray pits, distribution of axial parenchyma, ray width, and the presence and location of crystals. The primitive nature of Prionoteae and Archerieae {{is supported by the}} presence of scalariform perforation plates with many bars and scalariform to opposite vessel pitting. The wood structure of Oligarrheneae {{is similar to that of}} Styphelieae, but the very narrow vessel elements, exclusively <b>uniseriate</b> <b>rays</b> and the lack of prismatic crystals in Oligarrheneae distinguish these two tribes. The secondary xylem of Monotoca tamariscina indicates that it does not fit in Styphelieae; a position within Oligarrheneae is possible. Like most Cosmelieae, all Richeeae are characterized by exclusively scalariform perforation plates with many bars, a very high vessel density and paratracheal parenchyma, although they clearly differ in <b>ray</b> width (exclusively <b>uniseriate</b> <b>rays</b> in Cosmelieae vs. uniseriate and wide multiseriate rays in Richeeae). Several wood anatomical features confirm the inclusion of epacrids in Ericaceae s. l. Furthermore, there are significant ecological implications. The small vessel diameter and high vessel frequency in many epacrids are indicative of a high conductive safety to avoid embolism caused by freeze-thaw cycles, while the replacement of scalariform by simple vessel perforation plates and an increase in vessel diameter would suggest an increased conductive efficiency, which is especially found in mesic temperate or tropical Styphelieae.

40|$|Qualitative and {{quantitative}} data are presented for 22 collections of 14 species of Hedyosmum. Wood {{of the genus}} is primitive in its notably long scalariform perforation plates; scalariform lateral wall pitting of vessel elements; and the low ratio of length between imperforate tracheary elements and vessel elements. Pit membrane remnants are characteristically present to various degrees in perforations of vessel elements; this is considered a primitive feature that is related to other primitive vessel features. Specialized features of Hedyosmum wood include septate fiber-tracheids with much reduced borders on pits; vasicentric axial parenchyma; and absence of <b>uniseriate</b> <b>rays</b> (in wood of larger stems). Ray structure (predominance of upright cells) and ontogenetic change in tracheary element length are paedomorphic, suggesting the possibility of secondary woodiness in the genus.

3000|$|In {{previous}} models {{the distribution}} of radial tensile stresses in the tree trunk has been explained {{as a response to}} the mechanisms of growth stress generation in the longitudinal and tangential directions. We investigated the contribution of ray tissue to growth stress generation in the tree trunk by the origin of the radial stresses during differentiation of parenchyma cells. Measurements on three konara oak trees (Quercus serrata Thunb.) were carried out comparing the radial residual strain of big oak rays with the radial residual strain of the axial tissues (containing only <b>uniseriate</b> <b>rays).</b> The results indicated that the ray tissue generated tensile growth stress in the radial direction of the trunk (the axial direction of the parenchyma cells). In contrast to previous assumptions, the growth stresses seem to be variable in relation to the individual tissue types. The mechanical advantage of a radially prestraining effect of the rays is discussed for the living tree.|$|R
40|$|International audienceAnatomically {{preserved}} axes representing three lignophyte species {{occur in}} the middle Tournaisian deposit of Kahlleite in Thuringia. One {{is characterized by a}} small oval eustele, short <b>uniseriate</b> <b>rays,</b> and alternate distichous phyllotaxy. It is assigned to the progymnosperm genus Protopitys. The two others share a eustelic primary vascular system comprising a parenchymatous pith and numerous xylem strands in a peripheral position. The secondary xylem comprises rays that are mostly uniseriate and rarely exceed 20 cells in height. One is referred to as Eristophyton sp.; the second, characterized by ray cells showing a wide range of sizes and shapes is assigned to Aporoxylon primigenium. These records extend the stratigraphical range of Protopitys and Eristophyton down to the middle Tournaisian and confirm their great longevity through most of the Mississippian.

40|$|Eight wood samples {{representing}} six {{species in}} two genera of Scytopetalaceae are examined {{with respect to}} qualitative and quantitative features. Rhaptopetalum differs from Scytopetalum by having scalariform perforation plates, fiber-tracheids, longer vessel elements, {{and a series of}} features probably related to the understory status of Rhaptopetalum is compared to the emergent nature of Scytopetalum. Features ofScytopetalaceae relevant to relationships of the family include (I) scaJariform perforation plates; (2) alternate medium-sized intervascular pits; (3) scalariform vessel-parenchyma pitting; (4) diffuse-in-aggregates and scanty vasicentric axial parenchyma; (5) axial parenchyma strands subdivided in places into chains of chambered crystals; and (6) rays that are high, wide, heterogeneous, and with erect cells comprising <b>uniseriate</b> <b>rays.</b> These features are compared for a number of families alleged by recent phylogenists to be related to Scytopetalaceae.

40|$|Wood {{anatomical}} {{studies in}} the economically important Apocynaceae or dogbane family are fragmentary. This study represents a first attempt to unravel the phylogenetic signifi cance and major evolutionary trends in the wood of the family, using existing and new microscopic wood observations within the large subfamily Rauvolfi oideae. On the basis of LM and SEM observations of 91 species representing all 10 currently recognized tribes, we found {{that most of the}} tribes are characterized by a unique combination of wood characters, such as vessel grouping, vessel element length, fi ber type, frequency of <b>uniseriate</b> <b>rays,</b> and fused multiseriate rays. Climbing rauvolfi oid taxa can generally be distinguished from erect species by their wider vessels, tendency to form paratracheal axial parenchyma, presence of tracheids, and occurrence of laticifers in rays. With respect to the entire family, there is a general phylogenetic trend toward shorter vessel elements, a higher proportion of vessels in multiples and more vessels per multiple, higher tracheid abundance, more paratracheal parenchyma, and fewer cells per axial parenchyma strand in the more derived Apocynaceae. Most of these evolutionary trends are likely to be triggered by drier environmental conditions and/or shifts from an erect to a climbing habit...|$|R

Empetraceae have vessels somewhat angular in transection, with scalariform perforation plates and scalariform to opposite vessel-ray pitting. Imperforate tracheary elements are all tracheids. Axial parenchyma is sparse and not subdivided. <b>Rays</b> are characteristically <b>uniseriate</b> and composed of upright cells (older stems have rays with both upright and procumbent cells). These features ally Empetraceae closely to Ericaceae and Epacridaceae.

40|$|The {{pattern of}} {{secondary}} growth {{and structure of}} secondary xylem was studied in the stem of the Neotropical liana Securidaca rivinifolia A. St. -Hil. (Polygalaceae). Increase in thickness of the stem was achieved by formation of successive cambia, from which initially two or three successive rings formed complete oval to circular cambia. Thereafter, the successive cambia were always crescent-shaped and never formed a complete cylinder, resulting in dumbbell-shaped cross-sectional outlines of the stems. The first successive cambium originated in the pericyclic parenchyma located outside the crushed protophloem. Prior {{to the development of}} cambium, pericyclic parenchyma formed a meristematic band of radially arranged cells. From this band, cells located {{in the middle of the}} band became the new ring of cambium. Cells on the inner face of the xylem produced by newly formed cambium differentiated into conjunctive tissue. The first elements to be differentiated from the newly developed cambium were always xylem fibres but differentiation of vessels was also observed occasionally.

40|$|Qualitative and {{quantitative}} data are presented for 17 collections of 15 species representing 14 genera. One species is a shrub (Cocculus laurifolius), one a subshrub (C. trilobus), {{and the remainder}} are lianas. Successive cambia are analyzed with respect to ontogeny and histology of products. Whether any Menispermaceae {{may or may not}} plesiomorphically lack successive cambia would require a more extensive survey of the family. Apomorphic absence of successive cambia is likely for species with subshrub growth forms (Cocculus trilobus, Menispermum canadense L.). Lianoid Menispermaceae share the following features: successive cambia, wide vessels, wide rays, high conductive area per transectional unit area, and tracheids as imperforate tracheary elements. All of these features are more common in lianoid dicotyledons than in their nonlianoid relatives. Vessels are solitary in the lianoid species on account of tracheid presence, but grouped in Cocculus trilobus, which has septate libriform fibers. Large multiseriate rays (combined with scarcity or absence of <b>uniseriate</b> <b>rays)</b> and storied structure of cambia (and cambial products that elongate little during maturation) characterize Menispermaceae and link the family to other families of Ranunculifiorae, as well as, in all likelihood, to the 2 ̆ 2 paleoherb 2 ̆ 2 families Aristolochiaceae, Lactoridaceae, Piperaceae, and Saururaceae...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} features are presented for 13 collections of 8 species of Ascarina. Wood anatomy is maximally primitive in most respects; moderate exception {{occurs in the}} imperforate tracheary elements, which range from tracheidlike (A. solmsiana) to fiber-tracheids (septate in two species). Perforation plates are scalariform, average more than 100 bars per plate, and have bordered bars. Even more significantly, portions of the primary walls in perforations characteristically fail to dissolve; these pit membrane portions range from nearly intact (much like the pit membranes in pits on end walls of tracheids of vesselless dicotyledons) to remnant strands or flakes. Dissolution of pit membranes in perforations is apparently inhibited by deposition of resinlike substances in some species; the rugose surfaces formed by these deposits may account for a report of vesturing on vessel walls of Ascarina. Axial parenchyma is diffuse, with only very small expressions of diversification; apotracheal banded parenchyma is, however, present in A. swamyana. Wood of Ascarina is highly mesomorphic. With age of plant, vessels increase in diameter, vessel elements and fiber-tracheids increase in length, and rays become wider and have {{a higher proportion of}} procumbent cells; <b>uniseriate</b> <b>rays</b> decrease in abundance.

We examined the wood anatomy of this stump, together with other permineralized woods and leaf impressions from the same stratigraphic level, to {{gain an understanding of}} the vegetation intercepted by the lahar. Wood of the Hancock Tree is characterized by narrow and numerous vessels, exclusively scalariform perforation plates, exclusively <b>uniseriate</b> <b>rays,</b> and diffuse axial parenchyma.

40|$|Qualitative and {{quantitative}} data are presented for woods of 37 species representing 11 genera; most species included represent a maximal degree of woodiness for the family, and herbaceous groups are mostly omitted. Growth rings are absent or nearly so. Vessel elements have simple perforation plates (except for Kohleria elegans) and alternate circular or oval pits {{of various sizes}} on vessel-vessel walls (often laterally elongate, often with gaping apertures, on vessel-parenchyma and vessel-septate fiber interfaces). Grooves interconnect pit apertures in vessels of four genera. Vessels are grouped, usually in radial chains, to a moderate extent. Tyloses are present. Imperforate tracheary elements are libriform fibers or (Coronanthera) fiber tracheids with vestigial borders on pits. Septa are present in imperforate tracheary elements of most species, but in most species of Cyrtandra, septate fibers occur only near vessels. <b>Uniseriate</b> <b>rays</b> are present in some species, but in most species rays are muItiseriate only or are absent altogether. Vascular and vasicentric tracheids are absent. In Cyrtandra, wood with multiseriate rays can be demonstrated to be rayless earlier in ontogeny. Crystals are present in rays and in septate fibers of a few species. Storying is present in a few species. All features of wood reflect the mesic habitats characteristic of Gesneriaceae, but moderate degrees of xeromorphy are illustrated by species in which narrow vessels, grouped vessels, and grooves in vessel walls occur. The wood anatomy of Drymonia reflects its vining habit. Raylessness may indicate secondary woodiness in Besleria and Cyrtandra.

40|$|Wood {{anatomy of}} 14 species of Clematis and one species each of Delphinium, Helleborus, Thalictrum, and Xanthorhiza (Ranunculaceae) is {{compared}} to that of Glaucidium palma tum (Glaucidiaceae) and Hydrastis canadensis (Ranunculaceae, or Hydrastidaceae of some authors). Clematis wood has features typical of wood of vines and lianas: wide (earlywood) vessels, abundant axial parenchyma (earlywood, some species), high vessel density, low proportion of fibrous tissue in wood, wide rays composed of thin-walled cells, and abrupt origin of multiseriate rays. Superimposed on these features are expressions indicative of xeromorphy in the species of cold or dry areas: numerous narrow latewood vessels, presence of vasicentric tracheids, shorter vessel elements, and strongly marked growth rings. Wood of Xanthorhiza is like that of a (small) shrub. Wood of Delphinium, Helleborus, and Thalictrum is characteristic of herbs that become woodier: limited amounts of secondary xylem, parenchymatization of wood, partial conversion of ray areas to libriform fibers (partial raylessness). Wood of Ranunculaceae other than Clematis has numerous narrow vessels, probably an adaptation to cold more than drought. Glaucidium has occasional scalariform perforation plates like those almost universally present in Paeonia, but the two genera differ strongly in other wood features. Wood of Hydrastis (scalariform perforation plates occasional in primary xylem, rare in secondary xylem) accords with the idea that Hydrastis is a lineage that separated from the base of Ranunculaceae. Features that ally Ranunculaceae with other families of Ranunculiflorae include presence of wide multiseriate <b>rays</b> (without accompanying <b>uniseriate</b> <b>rays),</b> vessel restriction patterns, and storied structure.

Wood of all Myoporaceae represents variation on a basic plan: woods diffuse porous or semi-ringporous; vessels with simple perforation plates; lateral wall pits of vessels alternate and circular, with grooves interconnecting some pit apertures; vessels grouped to various degrees into radial multiples; imperforate tracheary elements all fiber-tracheids with pit cavities 1 - 5 μm in diameter (wider on contacts with ray cells), nonseptate; axial parenchyma vasicentric scanty plus, in some species, tangential para tracheal bands (sometimes terminal); rays multi seriate plus uniseriate (uniseriate almost exclusively in two species of Eremophila); ray cells procumbent exclusively, upright and square in <b>uniseriate</b> <b>rays</b> and in tips of multiseriate rays; rays storied in some species of Eremophila, axial parenchyma variously storied; crystals present in ray cells of some species of Eremophila and in fibers of E. polyclada; amorphous deposits and starch often present in parenchyma. Ofiia differs from Myoporaceae by having: septate libriform fibers rather than fiber-tracheids; large pits on vessel walls; axial parenchyma nearly absent; and erect cells predominant in rays. Oftia may be placed in Scrophulariaceae. Leucophyllum differs from Myoporaceae by having: helical thickenings in vessels; vasicentric tracheids transitional from vascular tracheids; scarce axial parenchyma; and erect cells predominant in rays. Leucophyllum may be excluded from Myoporaceae. Wood anatomy ofMyoporaceae shows relationship between Myoporaceae, Scrophulariaceae, and Gesneriaceae, and is also indicative of derivation from woody ancestors.

40|$|The wood {{anatomy of}} the palaeotropical Melastomataceae is {{described}} in detail {{on the basis of}} 134 samples of 107 species from 36 genera. On the wood anatomy, three subfamilies are recognized, Memecyloideae, Melastomatoideae, and Crypteronioideae. The Memecyloideae stand out through their fibre-tracheids, the deviating fibre length/vessel member length ratio, and the scanty paratracheal to aliform parenchyma. The Melastomatoideae are characterised by libriform fibres showing fibre dimorphism and rays composed of erect, square, and weakly procumbent cells (also in Memecyloideae p. p.). The subfamily Astronioideae is abolished; Pternandra is transferred to Memecyloideae, the Astronieae fit perfectly in the Melastomatoideae. Within Melastomatoideae the tribes are not easy to separate. The subtribe Dissochaetineae (all climbers) of the Dissochaeteae stands out because of its multiseriate rays, subtribe Medinillineae has scalariform inter-vessel pits; Astronieae have longest vessel members of the palaeotropical Melastomataceae, <b>uniseriate</b> <b>rays,</b> and bands of deviating fibres in which axial parenchyma is scarcely present: in the Osbeckieae apotracheal parenchyma bands (probably originated through fibre dimorphism) characterise the wood of Dichaetanthera; it is proposed to combine Oxysporeae and Sonerileae to one tribe Sonerileae; {{on the basis of the}} inter-vessel pitting two subtribes are recognized, different in delimitation from the two original tribes. The family Crypteroniaceae s. s. (Axinandra, Crypteronia and Dactylocladus) is incorporated in Melastomataceae as a separate subfamily. The scalariform inter-vessel pits, present in palaeotropical Melastomataceae only, must be interpreted as a specialization from the alternate pattern. Raphides are present in one species of Bredia, B. tuberculata. Clustered crystals are observed in the axial parenchyma and rays of Dichaetanthera. Large elongate crystals are present in the parenchyma of the strands of axially included phloem of the Memecyloideae. Variation in quantitative characters (vessel member length, vessel diameter and frequency) can partly be explained from the ecological preference of the species concerned. Wood anatomical differences between lianas and erect relatives are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} data are presented for wood of 42 collections of 23 species of Ephedra from North and South America; data on bark anatomy are offered {{for most of}} these. For five collections, root as well as stem wood is analyzed, and for two collections, anatomy of horizontal underground stems is {{compared to that of}} upright stems. Vessel diameter, vessel element length, fiber-tracheid length, and tracheid length increase with age. Vessels and tracheids bear helical thickenings in 10 North American species (first report); thickenings are absent in Mexican and South American species. Mean total area of perforations per mm 2 of transection is more reliable as an indicator of conductive demands than mean vessel diameter or vessel area per mm 2 of transection. Perforation area per mm 2 is greatest in lianoid shrubs and treelike shrubs, less in large shrubs, and least in small shrubs. Plant size is roughly proportional to ecology, and thus perforation area per mm 2 is indicative also of ecology. Growth rings are not marked in lianoid or tropical or subtropical species. Latewood has few or no vessels (and thus offers maximal conductive safety) in species from colder and drier habitats. The ecology of the species range from dry to extremely dry habitats. Rays are mostly wide multiseriate, but three tropical or subtropical species have <b>uniseriate</b> <b>rays</b> plus narrow multiseriate rays-possibly a primitive condition. The fiber-tracheids (parenchyma of other authors) are nucleated, and are considered a result oftracheid dimorphism phylogenetically. Tracheids are vaguely storied in a few species. Minute calcium oxalate crystals cover outer surfaces of wood ray cells, phloem ray cells, sieve cells, and phloem parenchyma abundantly in most species; the crystals are slightly less abundant on vessel, tracheid, and fiber-tracheid surfaces (first report of these crystals on these cell types). Crystals, tannins, and five types of sclerenchyma in bark are considered types of herbivore deterrents. Bark of some species is richer in these features; other species are poor in sclerenchyma or tannins or both. Independent evolution of vessels in Gnetales and angiosperms is briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePermineralized Vertebraria roots {{from the}} late Permian of the Central Transantarctic Mountains, Antarctica, are {{investigated}} to understand the unusual vascular anatomy of the genus. The specimens range from; 1 mm to several centimeters in diameter and illustrate all the stages of secondary growth. Our observations confirm previous hypotheses {{on the development of}} these roots and suggest that their unique anatomy {{is the result of a}} change in developmental timing. Vertebraria is characterized by a vascular cambium that remains discontinuous through several growth seasons, leading to the formation of lacunae alternating in cross section with wedges of secondary vascular tissues. The bifacial nature of the cambium is confirmed by the presence of well-developed secondary phloem composed of longitudinally elongated cells and <b>uniseriate</b> parenchymatous <b>rays.</b> In some of the largest specimens, a continuous vascular cylinder is formed by the differentiation of cambium from parenchymatous cells bordering the lacunae. The new specimens provide additional information on the secondary xylem anatomy and vascular connection to lateral roots...|$|R
40|$|Leptadenia reticulata, an {{important}} medicinal plant of India, {{was subjected to}} a detailed pharmacognostical analysis to locate distinguishing biomarkers. Multicellular uniseriate smooth trichomes, bi-collateral vascular bundles, anisocytic stomata and absence of any cell inclusions were the features seen in leaf. Stem possessed broad patches of sclereids in the pericycle and irregular patches of intraxylary phloem and internal phloem consisted of radial rows of angular cells with starch grains. Secondary xylem consisting of large vessels and tracheids and prismatic crystals of calcium oxalate in cortex are very distinct. Large sclereids, starch grains and prismatic calcium oxalate crystals in cortex, bast and parenchyma differentiate roots. X-shaped pits and multiseriate medullary rays were seen in stem whereas roots possessed simple pits and mostly <b>uniseriate</b> medullary <b>rays.</b> Other micromorphological characters were stomatal index 11. 67 ± 0. 68, palisade ratio 6. 0 ± 0. 39, vein islet number 9. 5 ± 0. 97, and vein termination number 11 – 12...|$|R
30|$|The Lower Cretaceous Guantou Formation {{is known}} as an {{important}} horizon for the Cretaceous petrified woods in southern China. Though abundant Cretaceous wood remains {{have been found in}} this formation, only one species has been recognized. A new coniferous wood, Brachyoxylon zhejiangense sp. nov. is described from the Lower Cretaceous Guantou Formation in Xinchang of Zhejiang Province, southeastern China. Anatomically, the new species is characterized by obscure annual rings, mixed type of radial pitting, araucarioid cross-field pits and <b>uniseriate</b> xylem <b>rays.</b> The finding of Brachyoxylon zhejiangense sp. nov. represents the first well-defined record of Brachyoxylon in southeastern China, and enriches the diversity of the Early Cretaceous petrified wood in southern China. Additionally, the new finding sheds new light on further understanding the floral composition, especially the forest vegetation type of the southern phytoprovince in the late Early Cretaceous. Diverse compressed leaf fossils of Cheirolepidiaceae have been described from the Guantou Formation in the fossil locality of the present petrified wood. The co-occurrence of Brachyoxylon zhejiangense sp. nov. and those cheirolepidiaceous leaf fossils provide additional evidences to support that Brachyoxylon may be systematically related to the Cheirolepidiaceae.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Quercus cerris L. var. cerris has a {{conspicuous}} bark {{which is generally}} thicker than that of other Quercus L. species in Turkey. The present study aimed to provide detailed anatomical characterisation of the bark of this species, which is necessary to assess its potential. The anatomical studies were conducted on the bark samples of nine 70 - to 80 -year-old trees growing in 3 sites of Andırın district from Kahramanmaraş province in Turkey. For microscopic observation transverse and longitudinal sections were prepared and individual specimens were taken for maceration. The bark is composed of phloem, periderm, and a very substantial rhytidome. The rhytidome has sequential periderms with phloem tissue between them, and includes compact nodules of sclerified tissues. The phellem has typical cork cells arranged regularly in radial rows and showing rings. The phelloderm is poorly developed. The phloem is layered regularly from cambium until the last formed periderm in successive tangential bands of fibres and groups of sclereids alternated with axial parenchyma and sieve tubes. <b>Uniseriate</b> phloem <b>rays</b> transverse the fibre groups, and fused phloem rays originate conspicuous broad rays. The dilatation growth showed large and conspicuous sclereids. Numerous crystals and druses in axial parenchyma cells were also observed. Full illustration of this species is given...|$|R
40|$|Xylite is a lithotype of lignite, mainly {{used for}} fuel. The wood {{from which it}} was formed {{in a long term}} process (duration ca. 2 {{millions}} of years) was subjected to drastic changes. We conducted anatomical characterization of xylite, evaluated preservation of wood from which it was formed, defined its basic physical properties, and compared it with modern wood. We recognized ground tissue composed of tracheids, <b>uniseriate</b> and homocellular <b>rays,</b> taxodioid like crossfield pits, and abundant axial parenchyma with inclusions. The observed features are typical of coniferous wood species of the Taxodiaceae and Cupressaceae families. Colourimetric properties of xylite in CIE Lab* system are comparable to those of heartwood of ebony or wenge. The xylite had high oven dry density (1, 216 kg/m 3), but due to very high volumetric shrinkage (28. 2...|$|R
40|$|Qualitative and {{quantitative}} wood features are reported for 38 species representing 22 genera, including the scandent genera Mendoncia and Thunbergia. Woods of Acanthaceae {{are characterized by}} relatively narrow vessels with simple perforation plates and alternate lateral wall pitting, septate libriform fibers, scanty vasicentric axial parenchyma, rays both multiseriate and <b>uniseriate,</b> erect <b>ray</b> cells abundant in rays (some species rayless or near-rayless), numerous small crystals or cystoliths in ray cells in a few genera (first documented reports of both characters in woods of Acanthaceae), and nonstoried structure. This constellation of features is very closely matched by woods of Gesneriaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Pedaliaceae, Martyniaceae, Bignoniaceae, and Myoporaceae (families listed in order ofdecreasing resemblance). Narrowness ofvessels in tropical Acanthaceae appears related to understory ecology. A few species in warm and seasonally dry areas have narrow, short vessel elements numerous per unit transection. Vasicentric tracheids occur in two nonscandent genera in dry areas. Vessel grouping is roughly proportional to dryness of habitat. Thunbergia alata, T. laurifolia, and all collections of Mendoncia have interxylary phloem (first report for Mendoncia). That feature, plus presence of occasional acicular crystals in rays and axial parenchyma and presence of large gelatinous fibers in phloem ally Mendoncia closely with Thunbergia, and Mendonciaceae is not justified for this and other reasons. Species of Thunbergia differ among themselves, and T. erecta and T. holstii resemble shrubby Acanthaceae {{more than they do}} Mendoncia in wood features. Thunbergia thus should not be segregated from Acanthaceae...|$|R
