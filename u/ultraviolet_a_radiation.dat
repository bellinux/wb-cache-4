Using a transgenic mouse line, which expresses the human elastin promoter, linked to a chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase reporter gene, in a tissue-specific and developmentally regulated manner, we investigated the effects of <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>A</b> <b>radiation</b> and ultraviolet B radiation on human elastin promoter activity in vivo and in vitro.

40|$|Keratinocytes are {{the primary}} {{cellular}} target for ultraviolet radiation in human skin, and ultraviolet radiation-induced therapeutical effects may thus be mediated by keratinocyte-derived, antiinflammatory mediators. Interleukin- 10 is capable of exerting anti-inflammatory effects {{by virtue of its}} capacity to suppress the production of interferon-γ. The present study therefore assessed the ability of cultured human keratinocytes to produce interleukin- 10 following ultraviolet irradiation. Exposure of long-term cultured normal human keratinocytes to ultraviolet B(280 - 320 nm) or to <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>A</b> 1 (340 - 400 nm) <b>radiation</b> caused <b>a</b> time- and dose-dependent induction of interleukin- 10 mRNA expression and interleukin- 10 protein secretion, with <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>A</b> 1 <b>radiation</b> being the strongest stimulus. Ultraviolet radiation-induced interleukin- 10 production by normal human keratinocytes was enhanced by a factor of two, when cells were cultured in high- rather than low-calcium medium. Neither addition of the ultraviolet radiation-inducible cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α or interleukin- 1 α to unirradiated keratinocytes nor presence of their respective neutralizing antibodies in cultures of irradiated keratinocytes induced or inhibited interleukin- 10 synthesis. Modulation of eicosanoid production by addition of prostaglandin E 2 to keratinocyte cultures or disturbance of cyclooxygenase activity by indomethacin did not affect interleukin- 10 production in resting or irradiated cells. These studies demonstrate that cultured human keratinocytes are capable of producing interleukin- 10. Human keratinocyte interleukin- 10 production is dependent on the differentiation state of the cell and induced by ultraviolet B and, in particular, <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>A</b> 1 <b>radiation</b> exposure.

We also found that the intensity of pepsin-digestible collagen cross-links in vivo increases linearly with age and that the fluorescence of epidermal tryptophan decreases linearly with age. We found that the fluorescence of pepsin-digestible collagen cross-links decreases immediately following exposure to ultraviolet A whereas epidermal tryptophan fluorescence increases. Both changes were dose dependent but the increase in tryptophan fluorescence occurred exclusively in young animals (2 – 6 mo old).

The cell survival fractions were 60. 2, 77. 1, 89. 0, 92. 9 and 96. 2 % when α-tocopherol was added at concentrations of 2. 9, 5. 9, 8. 8, 11. 8 and 14. 7 IU/ml, respectively. These results suggested that α-tocopherol is capable of protecting kerati-nocytes against UVA irradiation. Furthermore, the levels of GSH, lipid peroxidation and ROS were measured. The levels of GSH were 0. 354 and 0. 600 mmol/g protein in keratinocytes irradiated with UVA (8 J/cm 2) and in non-irradiated cells, respectively, whereas they were 0. 364, 0. 420, 0. 525, 0. 540 and 0. 545 mmol/g protein when α-tocopherol was added a...|$|R
40|$|C_ {{dissolved}} in toluene, benzene and carbon disulfide respectively, yielded a brown precipitate upon exposure to <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation.</b> <b>A</b> thin film was deposited on a silicon substrate when dipped {{in each of}} the solutions. Further examination of this deposit revealed: (1) the substance to be amorphous by TEM observation; (2) No oxygen was detected by Auger electron spectroscopy; (3) Absorption peaks produced by FT-IR differed from those of pristine C_ solid-state photopolymerized C_ and high-pressure polymerized C_ : (4) The same substance was obatained {{for each of the three}} solvents; (5) The substance obtained is presumably a new photopolymerized C_ solid...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} unlimited. A nonintrusive technique for flow visualization of momentum jets has been investigated. A flow system containing a fluid photosensitive to <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> (<b>a</b> solution of mineral spirits and photochromic dye) has been constructed for generating a momentum jet {{in a test}} chamber. An ultraviolet beam (337. 1 nm) from a pulsed nitrogen gas laser was fired through the test chamber producing opaque traces in the jet and ambient fluid. Movement of the fluid deformed these traces and produced a record of fluid flow. Velocity distributions have been obtained in laminar jets. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R
