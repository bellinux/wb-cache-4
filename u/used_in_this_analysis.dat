Initially, finite elements are used to create the engine's cylinder head model. Data gained from modal analysis is used for prediction of noise radiation from cylinder head surfaces.

Each key on the keyboard makes a subtly different acoustic signature when struck. It is then possible to identify which keystroke signature relates to which keyboard character via statistical methods such as frequency analysis. The repetition frequency of similar acoustic keystroke signatures, the timings between different keyboard strokes and other context information such as the probable language in which the user is writing are <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>analysis</b> to map sounds to letters. A fairly long recording (1000 or more keystrokes) is required so that a big enough sample is collected.|$|E
50|$|To {{ensure that}} its site rating {{accurately}} reflects {{the current state}} of a site, Norton Safe Web performs frequent re-analysis of Web sites. Norton Safe Web employs a site rating aging algorithm which estimates how often the safety of a particular Web site will change. Some of the factors <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>analysis</b> include the site's rating history, the site's reputation and associations, the number and types of threats detected on the site, the number of submissions received from Norton clients, and site traffic. In other words, unsafe sites that {{are more likely to have}} been cleaned up are re-analyzed often while those that might take longer to remove detected threats are re-analyzed less frequently. User reviews are also accepted, with contributors ranked by reputation. Should a site owner dispute the ranking of their site, they can submit a request for re-evaluation after completing a validation process.|$|E
5000|$|Edopoidea {{was named}} as a {{superfamily}} of temnospondyls by American paleontologist Alfred Romer {{in the second}} edition of his textbook Vertebrate Paleontology, published in 1945. He recognized a close relationship between the families Edopidae (which includes only Edops) and Cochleosauridae. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, {{the relationship between these}} two groups was supported by many phylogenetic analyses. One phylogenetic analysis separated Edops and cochleosaurids, finding the cochleosaurids to group with more derived temnospondyls like Archegosaurus. However, the skull characteristics <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>analysis</b> are common to almost all temnospondyls with elongated skulls, and are not strong evidence of evolutionary relationships because long snouts could easily have appeared through evolutionary convergence. Most recent phylogenetic analyses support a sister group relationship between Edops and Cochleosauridae, meaning that they are each other's closest relatives. Edopoids are usually placed at the base of Temnospondyli along with other primitive forms like Dendrerpeton, Balanerpeton, and Capetus. Below is a cladogram showing the relationships of edopoids from Sidor et al. (2006): ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{attempts}} to conceptualise {{the notion of}} the foreigner in relation to immigrant early childhood teachers. Sparked by Kristeva’s challenge, to live with and as others without ostracism or levelling, it highlights tensions that arise in a juxtaposition of the Aotearoa/New Zealand early childhood curriculum document, Te Whāriki and other guidelines for cross-cultural practices, with perspectives on the foreigner and foreignness. Situated in the neoliberal sociopolitical and cultural landscape of Aotearoa/New Zealand, the analysis foregrounds and re-frames orientations towards immigrant teachers as they may play out in the early childhood realm. Kristeva’s insights into foreigners’ raw and intimate experiences provide a freeing lens to emphasise influences on and consequences of a foreigner’s otherness. While Kristeva’s challenge may be a never-ending story of a utopian future <b>in</b> education, its <b>use</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>analysis</b> is intended to provoke an awareness of complex conceptualisations of foreignness and of tensions that could subvert the aim of working towards this, possibly elusive, ideal...|$|R

I have received helpful comments from participants at numerous seminars and conferences. This paper reports direct evidence on how recent changes in technology are related to changes in wage gaps by schooling, experience, and gender. Wage gaps by schooling in the full-year 1979 and 1989 Current Population Surveys increased the most in industries with rising R&D intensity and accelerating growth in the capital-labor ratio. Estimates {{of the impact of}} high-tech capital are mixed, with wage gaps increasing the most in industries that were high-tech-capital intensive in 1979 and decreasing in the industries with the greatest increase in high-tech-capital intensity. Contrary to popular notions that technological change harms older workers, wage growth of experienced workers is much greater in R&D-intensive industries than in industries with little R&D activity. The gender gap narrowed more in industries that most intensively <b>used</b> high-tech capital <b>in</b> 1979, especially among younger women with a high school degree or some college...|$|R
