40|$|Summary: The {{objective}} was to undertake a health economic analysis of denosumab {{for the treatment of}} osteoporosis in women from the UK, using the FRAX® tool. Denosumab was cost-effective in women with a risk of major osteoporotic fracture meeting or exceeding approximately 20 % who are <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> take, <b>comply</b> with or tolerate generic alendronate. Introduction: Denosumab is a novel biologic agent developed for the treatment of osteoporosis, which has been shown {{to reduce the risk of}} fractures in a phase-III trial. The objective of the present study was to undertake a health economic analysis of denosumab in women from the UK. Ten-year probabilities of a major osteoporotic fracture at which denosumab is a cost-effective alternative to no treatment, generic alendronate, risedronate and strontium ranelate were estimated. Methods: A previously published Markov model was adapted to incorporate fracture and mortality risk assessments based on absolute fracture probability, as estimated by FRAX®. The model included treatment persistence and residual effect after discontinuation. Results: At a willingness-to-pay (WTP) of £ 30, 000 per quality-adjusted life year and a 10 -year fracture probability equivalent to a woman with a prior fragility fracture, denosumab was cost-effective compared to no treatment from the age of 70 years. At the same WTP, denosumab was—irrespective of age—cost-effective compared to no treatment at a major osteoporotic fracture probability of approximately 20 %. Denosumab was estimated to cost-effectively replace strontium, risedronate and generic alendronate at 10 -year probabilities exceeding 11, 19 and 32 %, respectively. Conclusion: FRAX® facilitates the estimation of cost-effectiveness-based intervention thresholds applicable to patients with different combinations of clinical risk factors, which more closely matches the situation in clinical practice. Denosumab is cost-effective in patients with major osteoporotic fracture probabilities meeting or exceeding approximately 20 % who are <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> take, <b>comply</b> with or tolerate generic alendronate...|$|R

[...] The debate also introduced a long-term rift in the council of assistants between hardliners wanting to resist the king's demands at all costs and moderates who thought the king's demands should be accommodated. [...] Bellingham sided with the hardliners and the decision was reached to send the king a letter. [...] The letter questioned whether the request actually originated with the king, protested that the colony was loyal to him, and claimed the magistrates had already explained fully why they were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>comply</b> with the king's demands. [...] The magistrates further pacified the angered sovereign by sending over a ship full of masts as a gift (New England was a valuable source of timber for the Royal Navy).

On the other hand, when there is less closeness, token acceptances and avoidance strategies may be employed for face-saving purposes. Both sets of behavior (compliance and non-compliance) are interpreted in terms of the underlying interpersonal ideology of connectedness (Fitch 1998) that seems to operate in Quiteño society. Within this ideology, relationships can take precedence over the individual's own desires; if however, the bonds are less strong, people find ways of responding to social pressure without actually acting contrary to their own wishes...|$|R

This meant {{that the vast majority}} of Crane's employees would live in one time zone but work in another. Furthermore, a business park under construction at Crane's west gate would also straddle the new dividing line, with businesses on one side of the street being in a different time zone from those on the other.
