6000|$|In the {{beginning}} of this chapter you read of the reason of the parable of the <b>unjust</b> <b>judge</b> and the poor widow; namely, to encourage men to pray. [...] "He spake a parable to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;" [...] and a most sweet parable for that purpose it is: for if through importunity, a poor widow woman may prevail with an <b>unjust</b> <b>judge,</b> and so consequently with an unmerciful and hard-hearted tyrant, how much more shall the poor, afflicted, distressed, and tempted people of God, prevail with, and obtain mercy at the hands of, a loving, just, and merciful God? The <b>unjust</b> <b>judge</b> would not hearken to, nor regard the cry of, the poor widow, for a while: [...] "But afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man; yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me." [...] "Hark," [...] saith Christ, [...] "what the <b>unjust</b> <b>judge</b> saith." [...] "And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him?--I tell you that he will avenge them speedily." ...|$|E

Once free, he returns to Lizard and New Viron, where the final riddle of his identity is solved, and helps defend against a massive attack of inhumi during Hide's wedding. When the book ends, he and his companions (Nettle, Seawrack, Oreb, and Marble) have apparently returned finally to the Whorl, which then departs for the stars.|$|R

However, Perses apparently squandered his wealth and came back for what is owned by Hesiod. Perses went to law and bribed the lords to judge in his favour. The poem contains a sharp attack against <b>unjust</b> <b>judges</b> like those who decided in favour of Perses; they are depicted as pocketing bribes as they render their unfair verdicts. Hesiod seems to have thought that instead of giving him money or property which he will again spend in no time, it is better to teach him the virtues of work and to impart his wisdom which can be used to generate an income.|$|R

50|$|The {{extremely}} mixed {{character of}} his audiences {{led him to}} make his appeal as wide and general as possible. He avoids subtle theological questions, and advises the laity not to pry into the divine mysteries, but to leave them to the clergy, and content themselves with the credo. The weighty political occurrences of the time are also left untouched. But everything that affects the average man — his joys and his sorrows, his superstitions and his prejudices — is handled with intimate knowledge and with a careful clearness of arrangement easy for the most ignorant to follow. While exhorting all to be content with their station in life, he denounces oppressive taxes, <b>unjust</b> <b>judges,</b> usury, and dishonest trade. Jews and heretics are to be abhorred, and players who draw people's minds away to worldly pleasure; dances and tournaments are also condemned, {{and he has a}} word of blame for the women's vanity and proneness to gossip. He is never dry, always vivid and graphic, mingling with his exhortations a variety of anecdotes, jests, and the wild etymologies of the Middle Ages, making extensive use of the allegorical interpretation of the Old Testament and of his strong feeling for nature.|$|R

Against the rich, the luxurious, the Pharisee, the false lawyer, the priest, and the <b>unjust</b> <b>judge,</b> Holbein uses his fiercest mockery; but he is never himself unjust; never caricatures or equivocates; gives the facts as he knows them, with explanatory symbols, few and clear.|$|E

6000|$|But our Lord, in the Parable of the Talents, {{appears to}} {{actually}} sanction {{the practice of}} loans upon interest: [...] "Thou oughtest, therefore, to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury" [...] (Matt. xxv. 27). The preceding verse, the 26th, may well be understood to be a question--Didst thou indeed think so? It does not even indirectly attribute hardness and oppression to our Lord.[17] I am quite aware {{that it may be}} replied that this is an instance of those strong audacious metaphors, where the fact used by way of illustration is instinctively overleaped by the mind of the hearer to arrive at the lesson which it marks and emphasizes; as when the Lord is represented as an <b>unjust</b> <b>judge,</b> or Paul speaks of grafting the wild olive branch upon the good, or James refers to the rust and canker upon gold and silver, or Milton speaks of certain bishops as [...] "blind mouths."[18] But in all these cases, the hyperbole is manifest; it is an untruth or a disguise, which not only does not deceive, but teaches a great truth. Our Lord's reference to money-lenders or exchangers appears to lend an indirect sanction to a familiar practice.|$|E

So the Pharisee is said to pray with himself: God and the Pharisee were not {{together}}, {{there was only the}} Pharisee and himself. Paul knew not what to pray for without the Holy Ghost joined himself with him, and helping him with groans unutterable; but the Pharisee had no need of that; it was enough that he and himself were together at this work; for he thought without doubting that he and himself together could do. How many times have I heard ancient men, and ancient women at it with themselves, when all alone in some private room, or in some solitary path; and in their chat they have been sometimes reasoning, sometimes chiding, sometimes pleading, sometimes praying, and sometimes singing; but yet all has been done by themselves when all alone; but yet so done, as one that has not seen them must needs have concluded that they were talking, singing, and praying with company, when all that they had said, they did it with themselves, and had neither auditor nor regarder.|$|E

And among them, as later I heard in my bed, was Randal Rutherford, who had ransomed {{himself out of the}} hands of the French in Paris, whereat I was right glad. At Lagny, with her own men and the Scots, the Maid fought and took one Franquet d'Arras, a Burgundian [...] "routier," [...] or knight of the road, who plundered that country without mercy. Him the Maid would have {{exchanged}} for an Armagnac of Paris, the host of the Bear Inn, then held in duresse by the English, for his share in a plot to yield Paris to the King. But this burgess died in the hands of the English, and the echevins {34} of Lagny, claiming Franquet d'Arras as a common thief, traitor, and murderer, tried him, and, on his confession, put him to death. This was counted a crime in the Maid by the English and Burgundian robbers, nay, even by French and Scots. [...] "For," [...] said they, [...] "if a gentleman is to be judged like a manant, or a fat burgess by burgesses, there is no more profit or glory in war." [...] Nay, I have heard gentlemen of France cry out that, as the Maid gave up Franquet to such judges as would surely condemn him, so she was rightly punished when Jean de Luxembourg sold her into the hands of <b>unjust</b> <b>judges.</b> But I answer that the Maid did not sell Franquet d'Arras, as I say De Luxembourg sold her: not a livre did she take from the folk of Lagny. And as for the slaying of robbers, this very Jean de Luxembourg had but just slain many English of his own party, for that they burned and pillaged in the Beauvais country.|$|R

60|$|The poor lady's heart fainted within her, but {{she thought}} of the widow and the <b>unjust</b> <b>judge,</b> and persevered day after day in {{applying}} to every member of the royal family or of Government to entreat for her husband's liberation. The King's mother, sisters, and brother were all interested in his favour, but none of them ventured to apply direct to the King lest they should offend the favourite Queen. All failed, but the hopes that from time to time were excited, kept up the spirits of the sufferers. During the long weary months while the missionaries continued in fetters, i.e. chained by the feet to a bar of bamboo, Mrs. Judson was often not allowed to visit them for ten days at a time, and then only by walking to the prison after dark, two miles, unattended. She could, however, communicate with her husband by means of the provisions she sent him daily. At first she used to write on the dough of a flat cake, which she afterwards baked and concealed in a bowl of rice, while he answered by writing on a tile, where the inscription disappeared when dry but was visible when wet; but latterly they found it most convenient to write on a roll of paper hidden in the long nose of a coffee-pot, in which tea was sent to the prisoners.|$|E
60|$|This, therefore, of God's {{faithfulness}} {{being added}} to his might and power, is in itself a ground of great support to those that have in a way of well-doing committed themselves, their souls, to him to keep. A Creator; {{what is it that}} a Creator cannot do? A faithful Creator; what is it that one that is faithful will not do, that is, when he is engaged? And now he is engaged, because thou hast committed thy soul to him to keep, and because he has bid thee do so. Let them commit the keeping of their soul to him, as unto a faithful Creator. I have sometimes seen an unfaithful man engaged, when a thing has been committed to him to keep. A man that is a thief, a cheater, a defrauder, will yet be faithful to him that will commit a charge to him to keep. And the reason is, because, though he can steal, cheat, defraud, without being taken notice of; yet he must be seen and known, if he be false in that which is committed to him to keep. I know the comparison is odious, yet such have been made by a holier mouth than mine, and as the case may be, they may be aptest of all to illustrate that which a man is about to explain.

6000|$|... 1. That scripture in Luke 11:8 is very {{encouraging}} to any poor soul that doth hunger after Christ Jesus. In verses 5-7, he speaketh a parable {{of a man}} that went to his friend to borrow three loaves, who, {{because he was in}} bed, denied him; yet for his importunity-sake, he did arise and give him, clearly signifying that though poor souls, through the weakness of their faith, cannot see that they are the friends of God, yet they should never leave asking, seeking, and knocking at God's door for mercy. Mark, saith Christ, [...] "I say unto you, though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend; yet because of his importunity," [...] or restless desires, [...] "he will rise and give him as many as he needeth." [...] Poor heart! thou criest out that God will not regard thee, thou dost not find that thou art a friend to him, but rather an enemy in thine heart by wicked works (Col 1:21). And thou art as though thou didst hear the Lord saying to thee, Trouble me not, I cannot give unto thee, as he in the parable; yet I say, continue knocking, crying, moaning, and bewailing thyself. I tell thee, [...] "though he will not rise and give thee, because thou art his friend; yet, because of thy importunity, he will arise and give thee as many as thou needest." [...] The same in effect you have discovered, Luke 18, in the parable of the <b>unjust</b> <b>judge</b> and the poor widow; her importunity prevailed with him. And verily, mine own experience tells me, that there is nothing that doth more prevail with God than importunity. Is it not so with you in respect of your beggars that come to your door? Though you have no heart to give them anything at their first asking, yet if they follow you, bemoaning themselves, and will take no nay without an alms, you will give them; for their continual begging overcometh you. Are there bowels in you that are wicked, and will they be wrought upon by an importuning beggar? Go thou and do the like. It is a prevailing motive, and that by good experience, he will arise and give thee as many as thou needest (Luke 11:8).|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} provide a plausible alternative to the consensus interpretation of Jesus' "do not judge" teaching in Matt 7 : 1 - 5. While {{the overwhelming majority of}} recent interpreters understand "do not judge" (7 : 1) and its concurrent sayings such as "take the log out of your own eye" (7 : 5) to promote a non-judgmental attitude, this monograph seeks to situate this block of teaching within a Jewish second-Temple judicial setting. To this end, an overview of the judicial system during the second Temple era is provided, after which it is argued that Matt 7 : 1 - 5 is the Matthean Jesus' halakhic, midrashic comment upon the laws for just legal judging in Lev 19 : 15 - 18, 35 - 36 by which he prophetically criticizes <b>unjust</b> legal <b>judging.</b> Jesus' brother James takes up this teaching in Jas 2 : 1 - 13, using it to exhort Jewish Christian leaders who judge cases within Diaspora synagogues/churches. Such an alternative interpretation of Jesus' "do not judge" teaching in Matt 7 : 1 - 5 matches well other passages in Matthew which likewise speak of judicial, brotherly conflict such as 5 : 21 - 26 and 18 : 15 - 35. Some early Christian writers who quote or allude to Matt 7 : 1 - 5 reflect a judicial understanding of these verses as well, often relating Matt 7 : 1 - 5 to Lev 19 : 15 - 18, 35 - 36 and/or drawing parallels between Matt 7 : 1 - 5 and {{one or more of the}} NT judicial texts which, this thesis argues, is related to it (Matt 5 : 21 - 26, 18 : 15 - 35; Jas 2 : 1 - 13) ...|$|R

6000|$|And here, unquestionably, {{there are}} extremes, which every critic should avoid. Some {{imagine that a}} writer of a former century should be tried, either by the {{standard}} which prevails in the cultured and civilised nineteenth, or by the exposition of moral principles and practice {{which is to be}} found in the Scriptures. Now, it is obviously, so far as taste is concerned, as <b>unjust</b> to <b>judge</b> a book written in the style and manner of one age by the merely arbitrary and conventional rules established in another, as to judge the dress of our ancestors by the fashions of the present day. And in respect of morality, it is as unfair to visit with the same measure of condemnation offences against decorum or decency, committed by writers living before or living after the promulgation of the Christian code, as it would be to class the Satyrs, Priapi, and Bacchantes of an antique sculptor, with their imitations, by inferior and coarser artists, in later times. There must be a certain measure of allowance made for the errors of Genius when it was working as the galley-slave of its tradition and period, and when it had not yet received the Divine Light which, shining into the world from above, has supplied men with higher æsthetic as well as spiritual models of principles, and revealed man's body to be the temple of the Holy Ghost. To look for our modern philanthropy in that [...] "Greek Gazette," [...] the Iliad of Homer--to expect that reverence for the Supreme Being which the Bible has taught us in the Metamorphoses of Ovid--or to seek that refinement of manners and language which has only of late prevailed amongst us, in the plays of Aristophanes and Plautus--were very foolish and very vain. In ages not so ancient, and which have revolved since the dawn of Christianity, a certain coarseness of thought and language has been prevalent; and for it still larger allowance should be made, because it has been applied to simplicity rather than to sensuality--to rustic barbarism, not to civilised corruption--and carries along with it a rough raciness, and a reference to the sturdy aboriginal beast--just as acorns in the trough suggest the immemorial forests where they grew, and the rich greenswards on which they fell.|$|R
