25|$|Data exist {{from both}} {{observational}} and randomized clinical trials regarding {{the association between}} menopausal hormone replacement therapy (menopausal HRT) and breast cancer. The largest meta-analysis (1997) of data from 51 observational studies, indicated a relative {{risk of breast cancer}} of 1.35 for women who had used HRT for 5 or more years after menopause. The estrogen-plus-progestin arm of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), a randomized controlled trial, which randomized more than 16,000 postmenopausal women to receive combined hormone therapy or placebo, was halted early (2002) because health risks exceeded benefits. One of the adverse outcomes prompting closure was a significant increase in both total and invasive breast cancers (hazard ratio = 1.24) in women randomized to receive estrogen and progestin for an average of 5 years. HRT-related breast cancers had adverse prognostic characteristics (more advanced stages and larger tumors) compared with cancers occurring in the placebo group, and HRT was also associated with a substantial increase in abnormal mammograms. Short-term <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>hormones</b> for treatment of menopausal symptoms appears to confer little or no breast cancer risk. A correlation was found between the use of hormonal contraceptives and subsequent reliance on hormone replacement therapy.|$|E
25|$|Not all {{transsexual}} people {{undergo a}} physical transition. Some find reasons not to; for example, {{the expense of}} surgery, the risk of medical complications, or medical conditions which make the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>hormones</b> or surgery dangerous. Some may not identify strongly with another binary gender role. Others may find balance at a mid-point during the process, {{regardless of whether or}} not they are binary-identified. Many transsexual people, including binary-identified transsexual people, do not undergo genital surgery, because they are comfortable with their own genitals, or because they are concerned about nerve damage and the potential loss of sexual pleasure, including orgasm. This is especially so in the case of trans men, many of whom are dissatisfied with the current state of phalloplasty, which is typically very expensive, not covered by health insurance, and commonly does not achieve desired results. For example, not only does phalloplasty not result in a completely natural erection, it may not allow for an erection at all, and its results commonly lack penile sexual sensitivity; in other cases, however, phalloplasty results are satisfying for trans men. By contrast, metoidioplasty, which is more popular, is significantly less expensive and has far better sexual results.|$|E

2500|$|The primary {{difference}} between the popular promotions of CHRT and compounded BHRT involves BHRT advocates' use of regular testing of blood or saliva-bound hormone levels, use of individualized compounding rather than standard doses, dosing to attain certain levels in the body rather than for symptom relief, and the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>hormones</b> for purposes other than relief of menopausal symptoms.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Prevalence and duration <b>of</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>hormone</b> replacement therapy; menopausal status. RESULTS [...] Overall, 45. 7 % (436 / 954) of women doctors aged between 45 and 65 years had ever used hormone replacement therapy.

40|$|Osteoporosis is {{a serious}} {{condition}} that can be prevented by hormone replacement therapy taken by women who are postmenopausal. The decision to use hormone replacement therapy, however, {{is often difficult to}} make. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) compared the effectiveness of the delivery of computer-tailored information with non-tailored information via a web site on women 2 ̆ 7 s intention to continue or to initiate <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>hormone</b> replacement therapy for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. The study was based on Orem 2 ̆ 7 s Theory of Self-Care, the Health Belief Model, and the Elaboration Likelihood Model. Two hundred and eight women, ages 40 to 60, were enrolled in the study over an eight week period. All data were collected at one point of contact via the Internet. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the Health Belief Model variables of perceived barriers and confidence were predictors <b>of</b> current <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>hormone</b> replacement therapy. Women with high perceived barriers were less likely to use hormone replacement therapy and women with high confidence {{were more likely to be}} currently using hormone replacement therapy. Beliefs about menopause, <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>hormone</b> replacement therapy, and receipt of non-tailored information were predictors of intention to continue to use or begin to use hormone replacement therapy. Those women who believed that menopause was partially a medical problem, who used hormone replacement therapy, and who received non-tailored information were more likely to intend to continue use or begin to use hormone replacement therapy. The results contradicted expectations that tailored information would predict women 2 ̆ 7 s intention to continue to use or to begin <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>hormone</b> replacement therapy. Moreover, there were no significant differences in women 2 ̆ 7 s satisfaction with the web site and relevance of information between the tailored and non-tailored groups which was also an unexpected finding. While findings from the study do not support tailoring information regarding hormone replacement therapy, the results provide strategies for future research to determine the effectiveness of tailored information. ...|$|R
