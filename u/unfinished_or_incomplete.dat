25|$|Some doubt {{has been}} cast on the {{authenticity}} of the Lefay Fragment, as the handwriting in the manuscript differs in some ways from Lewis' usual style, and the writing is not of a similar calibre to his other work. Also in August 1963 Lewis had given instructions to Douglas Gresham to destroy all his <b>unfinished</b> <b>or</b> <b>incomplete</b> fragments of manuscript when his rooms at Magdalene College, Cambridge were being cleaned out, following his resignation from the college early in the month.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} famous legends from Java comes from the Pararaton (Book of Kings). It {{describes}} a legendary bladesmith called Mpu Gandring or Empu Gandring and his impatient customer, Ken Arok, in {{the last days of the}} Kediri kingdom in the 13th century. The customer ordered a powerful kris to kill the mighty chieftain of Tumapel, Tunggul Ametung. Ken Arok eventually stabbed the old bladesmith to death because he kept delaying the scheduled completion of the kris. Dying, the bladesmith cursed the kris through prophecy that the <b>unfinished</b> <b>or</b> <b>incomplete</b> kris would kill seven men, including Ken Arok. Ken Arok used Mpu Gandring's cursed kris to assassinate Tunggul Ametung, cunningly put the blame to Kebo Ijo, and built a new kingdom of Singhasari. The prophecy finally came true, with four men enlisted as the kris' first death roll, including Mpu Gandring himself, Tunggul Ametung, Kebo Ijo to whom Ken Arok lent the weapon, and finally Ken Arok himself. The unfinished kris then disappeared.|$|E
40|$|This report aims at {{giving you}} as a reader a basic {{knowledge}} in measurement techniques used in the road/land construction and witch instrument and methods that is commonly used. It also tries {{to shed light on}} the problem with <b>unfinished</b> <b>or</b> <b>incomplete</b> blueprints, which cause additional work performed by the surveyor. This report is written in collaboration with PEAB Umeå whom has given insight in their work. The goal of this report is to examine what kind of work surveyors has to perform on blueprints delivered by a technical consultant. The reader of this report gets a run-through of the different theoretical measurement techniques used today and a short explanation of different measuring instruments used by surveyors in their day to day work. Computer programs used in the field of construction are briefly explained, and some of the most common file extensions used, for example dwg and Land-xml. The report concludes in a questionnaire that was sent out to surveyors employed by PEAB. The questionnaire shows that there are a fair amount of time spent preparing blueprints before the actual construction work can begin...|$|E

40|$|Peace {{diplomacy}} {{has been}} a Norwegian foreign policy priority ever since the early successes of the Oslo channel in the Middle East. Though the nineties were a golden decade for peace diplomacy, the situation changed after 11 September 2001. Non-state parties {{to a number of}} internal conflicts have been labelled terrorist organizations, and the international community has tended to address such conflicts just as situations of one state fighting against terrorism. Instead, many internal, asymmetrical conflicts should be seen as cases of <b>unfinished</b> <b>or</b> <b>incomplete</b> state-building processes, and the international response should be one of supporting restructuring of the state to ensure all parts of society are included. This would require a willingness from governments to engage in asymmetrical diplomacy, implying negotiation with terrorists. International anti-terrorism measures have significantly constrained efforts to negotiate a peace. This has also had implications for Norway as its peace diplomacy has been caught between international anti-terrorism policies which it cannot influence, and peace diplomacy ambitions which it cannot live up to precisely because of the policies mentioned. This has led to the effectiveness and relevance of Norway’s peace diplomacy increasingly being called into question. In response, Norway should shape more comprehensive and less compartmentalized peace and security policies...|$|E
40|$|Often an <b>unfinished</b> <b>or</b> <b>incomplete</b> work is {{regarded}} {{with varying degrees}} of scepticism and even negativity to a certain extent - as if inconclusiveness somehow equates with failure, and the complete connected with success. On the other hand an unfinished object may also be seen as ‘invitational’ e. g. a door not having been given an attractive surface appearance in the final stage of manufacture as the item may be supplied unfinished for you to paint yourself! The unfinished work maintains a provisional relationship to its surroundings - to its present. There are many historical examples of works of art, literature, music, film and architecture that have been left unfinished and often the hand of fate has {{played a key role in}} this. However, an artwork that is unfinished through a deliberate artistic strategy speaks to our condition as humans and preserves an experimental ‘laboratory’ feel that is essential to its interpretation and appreciation. The work or object in this condition delays closure – it speaks about what is not there and in so doing conjures a dialogue with what is actually present. The deliberately unfinished work can on the one hand be seen to encourage anticipation, hopes and dreams - a more open, inventive, participatory plurality of voices, and on the other hand unrealised dreams. Whichever end of the scale you subscribe to, the unfinished work amounts to a proposition to engage in the work productively - in its potential future(s) - and situates those encountering the work in the present - in what Benjamin calls ‘the time of the now’. Rather than focussing [yet again] on failed utopias or abandoned hope this paper will focus on a year-long residency, including a series of micro engagements undertaken by this artist-presenter at ‘x-church’ in the UK, and will provide practical examples of current artistic research in the form of the unfinished project as a strategic mode of engagement and renewal. The project seeks to showcase contemporary artworks and practices that speak to a ‘lasting and immaculate present’ through the unfinished...|$|E
40|$|This solo {{exhibition}} {{was held at}} the Vanguard Gallery in the Moganshan District of Shanghai, November 2010. The Gallery, founded in 2004 specialises in showing Asian artists who are working in diverse media, but the gallery's curatorial policy includes an invited show from a European artist. This is the second time Alec has been invited to produce an installation at Vanguard, the first time being in 2006 in a two-man showing called 'Seeing Walls' (see: [URL] The show ' [...] but the steady renegotiation of small realities', accompanied by a publication {{in the form of a}} limited edition book, contributed to an ongoing investigation into notions of the <b>unfinished</b> <b>or</b> <b>incomplete</b> project. Referencing often broken and damaged structures associated with architecture and painting, the exhibition represented a 'paused project' and comprised a number of provisionalised audience engagements seemingly by several different artists. A wall-based grid work with enough spaces to show one hundred drawings of small piles of debris, but actually only showing fifty drawings and fifty empty spaces, appeared to be a work in progress. The drawings, each measuring 50 cm x 20 cm, were etched onto glass and had been made on a laser cutter. The glass was set 5 mm above the back board of the frame and so the actual ‘drawing’ appeared as a transient shadow on the back panel of the frame. The drawings drifted in and out of view with any changes to the light levels in the gallery space. The ephemeral shadows alluded to the absence of drawings in the gaps in the grid. The suite of drawings also echoed a pile of broken model houses in the form of a tableau, on the opposite side of the gallery. This tableau was reminiscent of a traditional still life that comprised broken model houses and four light boxes, each of which contained computer generated architectural form with a distinctive and celestial ‘skin’. Also included was a video loop of a woodland glade in early evening which was evocative of a painting by Poussin or Claude – but uninhabited. On the opposite wall hung a 10 m x 1 m banner showing 375 photographs. The photographs were the results of another strand of the broader research project exploring notions of fragility – especially with reference to the first and second frame (Kosuth) and ‘parergon’ (Derrida) and ensuing investigations of non-spaces or ‘liminal’ spaces (Matta-Clark). See: [URL] The photographic piece was accompanied (although not overtly in a literal/physical sense) by a two track video installation in the adjoining gallery space. The two video pieces were filmed in the late afternoon/early evening at two different municipal recycling centres at two different geographical locations. These centres are often found on so-called brownfield sites or ‘unwanted’ land in and around urban/suburban centres. The looped films showed a continuous engagement with unwanted material and objects associated with domestic living...|$|E
