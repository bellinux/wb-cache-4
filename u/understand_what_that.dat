500|$|When Homer and Marge [...] "snuggled" [...] to {{celebrate}} this development, she became pregnant. Homer {{was not happy}} {{when he found out}} about Marge's pregnancy, and was completely unenthusiastic about the impending birth. Because of the financial problems caused by the pregnancy, Homer was forced to make a sacrifice {{and go back to the}} power plant. However, Mr. Burns made Homer beg for his job back, and placed a large plaque in front of Homer's desk reading: [...] "Don't forget: you're here forever". Homer was once again unhappy at his work, but when Maggie was born, Homer instantly fell in love with her. Back in the present, Bart and Lisa still do not <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> has to do with Maggie's photos. Homer merely mentions that they are in the place where he needs them the most. The scene then cuts to his workplace where all of the photos of Maggie are positioned on the plaque on the wall, which now reads: [...] "Do it for her".|$|E
500|$|James {{had several}} unique {{experiences}} while {{living with the}} Smith family in Nauvoo. She recorded that often, as she went about doing the washing and cleaning for the Smiths, either Emma (Joseph's wife) or Lucy (Joseph's mother) would stop her and talk with her. One day while James was in Joseph's mother's room, the woman told her to [...] "bring me that bundle from the bureau and sit down here." [...] According to Jane, she was shown the Urim and Thummim, the tools used by Joseph Smith to translate the Book of Mormon. Lucy then said to her, [...] "You will live long after I am dead and gone {{and you can tell}} the Latter-day Saints that you was permitted to handle the Urim and Thummim". Another time, Emma asked James if she would like to be adopted by and sealed to her and Joseph. Not understanding at the time, James said nothing. Emma encouraged her to think about it. Two weeks later, she asked James again, at which time she said [...] "no m'am". James would say later that she did not <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> meant, or she would have taken the couple up on their offer. This early decision {{had a significant impact on}} James' later life as a member of the Latter Day Saint church.|$|E
2500|$|Another example {{occurred}} in Venezuela in 2003, when an illegal {{translation of the}} fifth book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, appeared soon {{after the release of}} the English version and five months before the scheduled release of the Spanish translation. The pirate translation was apparently so bad that the translator added messages, including [...] "Here comes something that I'm unable to translate, sorry," [...] and [...] "I'm sorry, I didn't <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> meant" [...] in some sections. Two people were arrested in connection with the pirated version.|$|E
60|$|I <b>understood</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> meant. They {{were afraid}} {{to tell me the}} truth. I insisted on the truth.|$|R
5000|$|... "Venezuelan Bárbara Hertiman {{have the}} {{ambition}} to make “films with an artistic quality {{that anyone can}} relate to”. She said she truly <b>understood</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> meant after showing her short to her niece and bringing the six year old to tears".|$|R
60|$|Campbell knew {{quite enough}} of the would-be cynical doctor, to <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> all <b>that</b> meant. He came up to Elsley.|$|R
60|$|And the {{solution}} of his problem came, all at once, when suddenly {{it was given to}} him to <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> problem was.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, it {{is a long}} story,' replied Nicholas, 'and one {{you would}} have some {{difficulty}} in comprehending, I fear. I have an enemy--you <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> is?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He must be here. He is {{the only}} man they could find who knows enough Italian to <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> fat fellow from Florence will say to-morrow." ...|$|E
60|$|The banker nodded. He had not a doubt but <b>that</b> he <b>understood</b> exactly <b>what</b> <b>that</b> {{position}} was.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> all <b>that</b> means?" [...] inquired Locker of Hemphill, who {{had been}} quietly {{listening}} to what had been going on.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes. The {{shame of}} marrying one man when you love another. You can't love two men.... You'll give yourself. You'll be his wife! Do you <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> means?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] exclaimed the other, {{brightening}} {{for a brief}} moment; [...] "yes, I {{did hear}} him. He {{said we were going}} six knots. Now I do not <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> means." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It says, sir, {{that the}} changes in the seasons are owing to 'the {{inclination}} of the earth's axis to the plane of its orbit,' I do not exactly <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> means, uncle.' ...|$|E
60|$|Nobody {{about the}} little {{settlement}} {{at the head of}} the deep inlet had seen the water quite so high at that season, and Gordon noticed how it frothed and boiled about the row of stone-backed piles that stretched out from either bank. As he listened to the hoarse roar of the pent-up torrent, he <b>understood</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> partly completed dam must have cost Nasmyth. After a little time Nasmyth rose, and, stepping on the plank, wearily straightened his back.|$|R
60|$|A.--I {{would have}} you <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> I say--namely, <b>that</b> I will meddle with nobody's {{business}} but my own.|$|R

6000|$|... "No; he {{has said}} nothing, and I have not {{misunderstood}} him." [...] Then there was a pause. [...] "He has said nothing to me, and I am bound to <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> means." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} her {{at any rate}} {{that you have been}} here, and that you have inquired after her with the {{greatest}} kindness. She will <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> means without any word of love." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm in no {{position}} to dictate terms yet,' he said. 'That will come later. I must probe into this a little further. In the meantime, I accept your invitation without prejudice--if you <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> means.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah!' she said, smiling graciously, {{and raising}} her splendid eyes to his face, 'I <b>understand</b> better <b>what</b> <b>that</b> famous beauty was now, and the {{fairness}} that {{caused her to}} be called the Swan.' ...|$|R

5000|$|Kahless was {{condemned}} to die by the tyrant Molor, who was angered that Kahless had incited the people against him. The night before his execution, Kahless asked {{that he be}} allowed {{to go out into the}} night and say farewell to the moon and the stars, for he knew that in the Netherworld, he would not see them again. Kahless gave his word that he would come back, and Molor let him go. Kahless had given his word and Molor <b>understood</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> meant. The next day at dawn, Kahless returned and was put to death. (TNG: [...] "Birthright, Part II") ...|$|R

60|$|Paul couldn't <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> {{had to do}} with it, nor why the {{two young}} women looked on so seriously, nor why Florence turned away her face for a moment, and then turned it back, lighted up again with smiles.|$|E
60|$|Of course {{some one}} had made it. Spotty the Turtle {{had known that}} as soon as he had seen the strange pond. All in a flash he had <b>understood</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> wall of logs and brush and mud across the Laughing Brook was for. It was to stop the water from running down the Laughing Brook. And of course, if the water couldn't keep on running and {{laughing}} {{on its way to the}} Smiling Pool, it would just stand still and grow and grow into a pond. Of course! There was nothing else for it to do. Spotty felt very proud when he had thought that out all by himself.|$|R

6000|$|... 'MY cock and MY basket!' {{interrupted}} he. 'And, {{if you are}} too {{deaf and}} too stupid to <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> means, I have got something which may help to teach you.' And opening the bag, he cried: 'Flack, flick, switch, be quick.' ...|$|E
