40|$|The social {{behavior}} of 3 T 3 cells and their polynoma virus-transformed derivative (Py 3 T 3 cells) was examined by time-lapse cinemicrography {{in order to}} determine what factors are responsible for the marked differences in the patterns formed by the two cell lines in culture. Contrary to expectations, both cell types have been found to exhibit contact inhibition of cell locomotion. Therefore, the tendency of 3 T 3 cells to form monolayers and of Py 3 T 3 cells to form crisscrossed multilayers cannot be explained {{on the basis of the}} presence versus the absence of contact inhibition. Morevover, with the exception of cell division control, the {{social behavior}} of the two cell types is qualitively similar. Both exhibit cell <b>underlapping</b> and, after contact between lamelliopodia, both show inhibition of locomotory activity and adhesion formation. Neither cell type was observed to migrate over the surface of another cell. The two cell types do show quantitative differences in the frequency of <b>underlapping,</b> the frequency with which contact results in inhibition of locomotion, and the proportion of the cell margin that adheres to the substratum. The increased frequency pf Py 3 T 3 <b>underlapping</b> is correlated with the reduced frequency of substratum adhesions, which in turn favors <b>underlapping.</b> On the basis of these observations, it is concluded that the differences in culture patterns are the result of differences in the shapes of the individual cells, such that <b>underlapping,</b> and hence crisscrossing, is favored in Py 3 T 3 cell interactions and discouraged in 3 T 3 cells...|$|R
40|$|Fault stepovers are {{features}} {{where the}} main {{trace of a}} fault steps from one segment to the next in either an <b>underlapping</b> or overlapping manner. Stepovers exert a critical influence on crustal permeability and are known to control phenomena such as the migration of hydrocarbons {{and the location of}} geothermal fields. In the Kalgoorlie-Ora Banda greenstone district, Western Australia, we demonstrate a spatial association between stepovers and gold deposits. It is shown that although <b>underlapping</b> stepover geometries are typically rare in fault systems, they are anomalously associated with gold deposits. Further, the along-strike and across-strike dimensions of both <b>underlapping</b> and overlapping fault stepovers fit, to a first-order approximation, the same self-similar trend. Boundary element modelling of Coulomb failure stress changes is used to explain these observations in terms of damage generated by rupture events on the bounding fault segments and associated aftershock sequences. Our models indicate that a larger region of damage and permeability enhancement is created around <b>underlapping</b> stepovers than around overlapping stepovers. By taking into account both the enhancement and decay of permeability during the seismic cycle, it is estimated that a 5 Moz goldfield could feasibly form in 1 – 16 earthquake-aftershock sequences, potentially representing durations of just 10 – 8000 years. The existence of supergiant gold deposits is evidence that crustal permeability attains transiently high values on the order of 10 − 12 m 2. It should be expected that transient and time-integrated permeability values have a distinct three-dimensional structure in continental crust due to stepover-related channels...|$|R

The following results have been obtained from our experiments. 	(1) The bursting strengths of warp knitted fabrics made of same material are subject to the densities of fabrics and the toughness of <b>underlap</b> yarns. As the differences of <b>underlap</b> lengths are very little among warp knitted fabrics with same weave and various densities, the bursting strengths of such fabrics are mostly determined by their densities. As the density of the fabric is increased, the bursting strength is greatly increased within certain limits of smaller density, and then with the gradually diminishing rate of increase. But the bursting strength does not noticcably increase beyond a certain limit of density. 	(2) The bursting strengths of warp knitted fabrics with same density and various weaves are determined by their <b>underlap</b> lengths and the numbers of the crossing of <b>underlap</b> with loop. The bursting strengths of the same density fabrics are increased with the <b>underlap</b> length of the fabric. 	(3) The absorbability of warp knitted fabrics made of same material is determined by the porosity of yarn itself and the inclined porosity between each crossing yarn in unit areas of the fabrics. In case of fabrics knitted with same density, both the total amount of water absorbed (a) and the rate of absorption of water (b) are increased with the increase of the density of the fabric.
