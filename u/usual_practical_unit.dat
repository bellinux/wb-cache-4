50|$|The B.A. {{system of}} <b>practical</b> <b>units</b> gained {{considerable}} international support, and was adopted - with one important modification - by the First International Conference of Electricians (Paris, 1881). The British Association had constructed an artefact {{representation of the}} ohm (a standard length of resistance wire which had a resistance of 109 CGS units of electric resistance, that is one ohm) whereas the international conference preferred a method of realization that could be repeated in different laboratories in different countries. The chosen method {{was based on the}} resistivity of mercury, by measuring the resistance of a column of mercury of specified dimensions (106 cm × 1 mm2): however, the chosen length of column was almost 3 millimetres too short, leading to a difference of 0.28% between the new <b>practical</b> <b>units</b> and the CGS units which were supposedly their basis.|$|R

25|$|Due to the {{typically}} large, bi-stable spin anisotropy, single-molecule magnets promise {{the realization}} of perhaps the smallest <b>practical</b> <b>unit</b> for magnetic memory, and thus are possible building blocks for a quantum computer.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to outline {{different}} ways of utilising our two chosen literary works for kids and teenagers in czech language and literature classes taking place during later years of primary education. Each of the works presents a child hero in a difficult life situation caused mainly by a bully, where the hero eventually overcomes the situation but expends all his energy in the process. The thesis consists of two units - theoretical and <b>practical.</b> The theoretical <b>unit</b> sums up expert findings on difficult life situations in general and applies them during analysis of our heroes and bullies. The <b>practical</b> <b>unit</b> has been divided into two parts, each covering one of the chosen works. First, we analyse the work's didactic potential, then suggest its utilisation in class and finally reflect on our practical demonstrations. We have also included an additional chapter to the <b>practical</b> <b>unit,</b> describing further ways of utilising one of the works in classes, not only czech language and literature but others as well. Output of this thesis is formed by two commented worksheets and an efficiency evaluation of our suggested class preparations, based on the actual demonstrations.
