5000|$|Robert Kunkel, a UND alumnus and Chicago {{advertising}} executive, was the originator of the trophy, and Blue Key, {{an honorary}} service fraternity at NDSU, and the UND Blue Key (Student Government after their Blue Key Chapter dissolved) administered the annual awarding. It is an oversized 75-pound {{replica of the}} James Earle Fraser-designed U.S. buffalo nickel with a buffalo on one side representing NDSU Bison and a Native American head {{on the other side}} representing UND, who were known as the Fighting Sioux until 2012. Fraser, best known for his sculpture, [...] "The End of The Trail", was born in Winona, MN and lived for a time in Dakota Territory. The coin-shaped trophy's [...] "mint" [...] date is 1937, the year the trophy was created. Jack Sather, a native of New England, ND, was commissioned to design and act a sculpture of the award. It took six weeks to complete the job and he was paid $65 for his work. Those funds were raised by both NDSU and UND Blue Key chapters from members and friends. The Nickel, at 250 times larger than a regular five-cent piece, weighs 75 pounds and is 2 inches thick and 22 inches in diameter. Both sides were 3/4" [...] relief and, from the original models, plaster casts were poured. The casts were hauled to a St. Paul, MN foundry where plaster copies were recast in an aluminum alloy. The halves were welded together to make the finished piece. It was first awarded in 1938 when NDSU won 17-13. It has been the object of many theft and [...] "kidnapping" [...] attempts by students from both universities. Governor William Langer was asked to participate in the unveiling of the new award in Grand Forks. Moments after the unveiling an <b>unidentified</b> <b>student</b> stepped up to Governor Langer, told him [...] "I'll take care of this for you", and disappeared with the nickel trophy. It turned up 36 hours later on the front lawn of then UND President John C. West (The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead, October 21, 1967) and a new tradition of [...] "kidnapping" [...] or [...] "borrowing" [...] the trophy had begun.|$|E

40|$|Reading {{and writing}} {{difficulties}} and dyslexia affect how a student performs at school and, thus, their future lives (Borodkin & Faust 2014). This {{has been known}} and researched for the past decades (Fletcher 2009). Considerable studies {{have been carried out}} regarding dyslexia and first language acquisition, though dyslexia in second language is comparatively underrepresented. This underrepresentation, in turn, means that dyslexia and second language is less researched, and consequently, less known. This is problematic as there is then less knowledge on how to help students with dyslexia in a second language. This case study investigates how an upper secondary school in Sweden works with defining and diagnosing dyslexia, and which provisions students with dyslexia receive. To answer these questions the Head teacher, Special Needs Education teacher, English teachers and a dyslexia test analyst have been interviewed. The results showed that dyslexia is described differently by the people interviewed, it is diagnosed with a software called LOGOS and the provision depends on the student having (or not having) a diagnosis. The conclusion is that English teachers and special needs teachers must work closer together. It is therefore suggested that cooperation between the teachers and special needs department should put each student in the centre and develop methods and strategies based on the individual student. It is hypothesised that the school has many <b>unidentified</b> <b>students</b> with dyslexia and in those cases additional adjustments in the classroom are vital. This would allow the student a better chance of performing according to their abilities in school and thus expanding the limits of their world ensuring they become fulfilled, employed democratic citizens...|$|R

This exploratory study determined which set of student characteristics and disability-related services explains graduation among college students with disabilities. The records of 1, 289 <b>unidentified</b> <b>students</b> with disabilities in three, public Midwestern universities were examined ex post facto to obtain information about students, disability-related services they received, and student graduation status. A hierarchical logistic regression framework was used to construct a model of factors that best predicts graduation among students with disabilities in college. That model includes: being female, being 23 years of age and older, having a physical disability, using alternative format tests, taking distraction reduced testing, having flexibility in assignment/ test dates, learning strategies assistance, and physical therapy/ functional training. Models were also constructed to explain graduation among students with cognitive disabilities, mental disorders, and physical disabilities. Factors that predicted graduation for students with cognitive disabilities were being female, being 23 years of age and older, taking distraction reduced testing, having flexibility in assignment/ test dates, and learning strategies assistance. Factors that predicted graduation for students with mental disorders were being white, being between 23 and 30 years of age, taking distraction reduced testing, and receiving extended test time. Graduation for persons with physical disabilities was explained primarily by students who were female and age 23 to age 30...|$|R

40|$|Welcome to the 6 th {{edition of}} the Electronic Journal of Inclusive Education. Providing insight into {{changing}} the attitudes of regular educators concerning inclusive practice and knowledge concerning accommodating students with special learning needs {{is the focus of}} this edition. We also have an article addressing concerns about the use of behavior modification in public school classrooms. As the conversation continues concerning including students with special needs in regular education classrooms, the need for greater awareness and acceptance of the diversity inherent in the human condition becomes clearer in light of the September 11 th attacks on the World Trade Center. One article highlights dispositions of caring and concern that can be taught in public school classrooms. We also welcome a new member to our editorial board, Dr. Kimberly G. Griffith. Dr. Karen A. Verbeke discusses and identifies strategies and approaches to accommodating students with special needs in the regular classroom. This article also highlights the need for ongoing communication and collaboration between regular and special educators to provide for the needs of all students. Dr. James D. Dunne writes a very cogent rebuttal to the recent criticism of the use of behavior analysis/behavior modification in public school situation. This article highlights four approaches to instruction that have proven to be extremely beneficial not only for students with disabilities but also for all students in general education classrooms. Dr. Dunne provides insight into these well-researched and proven instructional techniques. Dr. Julie K. Ivey and Dr. Kathryn Reinke document changes in pre-service teachers attitudes to inclusive practice due to the interactions and training they have received during a summer program in environmental education. This article reveals the need for pre-service preparation for inclusive practice for both regular and special educators and highlights the resistance by regular educators to inclusive practice and settings. Dr. Everington, Dr. Stevens, and Ms. Kozar-Kocsis surveyed regular educators efforts to differentiate instruction for students with disabilities as well as for <b>unidentified</b> <b>students</b> with different learning needs. Their study reveals that experienced educators can and do differentiate instruction and work 2 ̆ 2 in the spirit of inclusive education. 2 ̆ 2 Dr. Griffith, Dr. Cooper and Dr. Ringlaben provide a paradigm and model for full acceptance of student with disabilities in regular education classrooms. Unique to their approach is the effort to make 2 ̆ 2 students with disabilities part of a circle of relationships rather than the center of relationships 2 ̆ 2. This article highlights the need to teach caring dispositions in public education. This current edition continues the conversation and enhances the knowledge base concerning inclusive practice and access to knowledge within the public school.
