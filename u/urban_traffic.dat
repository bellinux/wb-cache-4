40|$|This paper {{examines}} a new {{evaluation of}} <b>urban</b> road <b>traffic</b> safety {{based on a}} matter element analysis, avoiding the difficulties found in other traffic safety evaluations. The issue of <b>urban</b> road <b>traffic</b> safety has been investigated through the matter element analysis theory. The chief aim of the present work is to investigate the features of <b>urban</b> road <b>traffic</b> safety. Emphasis {{was placed on the}} construction of a criterion function by which traffic safety achieved a hierarchical system of objectives to be evaluated. The matter element analysis theory was used to create the comprehensive appraisal model of <b>urban</b> road <b>traffic</b> safety. The technique was used to employ a newly developed and versatile matter element analysis algorithm. The matter element matrix solves the uncertainty and incompatibility of the evaluated factors used to assess <b>urban</b> road <b>traffic</b> safety. The application results showed the superiority of the evaluation model and a didactic example was included to illustrate the computational procedure...|$|R

25|$|The {{most common}} aspect of modern May Day {{celebrations}} is {{the preparation of}} a flower wreath from wild flowers, although {{as a result of}} urbanisation there is an increasing trend to buy wreaths from flower shops. The flowers are placed on the wreath against a background of green leaves and the wreath is hung either on the entrance to the family house/apartment or on a balcony. It remains there until midsummer night. On that night, the flower wreaths are set alight in bonfires known as St John’s fires. Youths leap over the flames consuming the flower wreaths. This custom has also practically disappeared, like the theatrical revival of Adonis/Dionysus/Maios, as a result of rising <b>urban</b> <b>traffic</b> and with no alternative public grounds in most Greek city neighbourhoods, not to mention potential conflicts with demonstrating workers.|$|E
25|$|The BMW i3 has two pedals {{like all}} cars with {{automatic}} transmission. The accelerator pedal acts as both accelerator and engine brake. When the driver releases the pedal, the vehicle's kinetic energy is regenerated by the vehicle drivetrain to recharge the battery. This {{has the effect}} of slowing the car down. During the field testing of the Mini E, which features an accelerator that recharges the battery in this way, and consists of brakes that only apply to the rear wheels, BMW has learned that drivers tend to rely on the engine brake: around 75% of all deceleration maneuvers are initiated without the brake pedal in <b>urban</b> <b>traffic</b> areas. BMW also expected the i3 to use the same type of battery and powertrain that is being tested in the BMW ActiveE trials.|$|E

25|$|As Commerce Secretary, Hoover also hosted two {{national}} conferences on street traffic, in 1924 and 1926 (a third convened in 1930, during Hoover's presidency). Collectively the meetings were called the National Conference on Street and Highway Safety. Hoover's chief {{objective was to}} address the growing casualty toll of traffic accidents, but the scope grew and soon embraced motor vehicle standards, rules of the road, and <b>urban</b> <b>traffic</b> control. He left the invited interest groups to negotiate agreements among themselves, which were then presented for adoption by states and localities. Because automotive trade associations were the best organized, many of the positions taken by the conferences reflected their interests. The conferences issued a model Uniform Vehicle Code for adoption by the states, and a Model Municipal Traffic Ordinance for adoption by cities. Both were widely influential, promoting greater uniformity between jurisdictions and tending to promote the automobile's priority in city streets.|$|E
25|$|The Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (the Milwaukee Road), {{the last}} transcontinental line to be built, {{electrified}} its lines across the Rocky Mountains {{and to the}} Pacific Ocean starting in 1915. A few East Coast lines, notably the Virginian Railway and the Norfolk and Western Railway, electrified short sections of their mountain crossings. However, by this point electrification in the United States was more associated with dense <b>urban</b> <b>traffic</b> {{and the use of}} electric locomotives declined in the face of dieselization. Diesels shared some of the electric locomotive's advantages over steam and the cost of building and maintaining the power supply infrastructure, which discouraged new installations, brought on the elimination of most main-line electrification outside the Northeast. Except for a few captive systems (e.g. the Black Mesa and Lake Powell), by 2000 electrification was confined to the Northeast Corridor and some commuter service; even there, freight service was handled by diesels. Development continued in Europe, where electrification was widespread.|$|E

In June 2007, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Mary Peters said that out of the nine finalist cities applying for the program, New York City was the farthest along in its traffic reduction planning and the city was eligible for up to $500 million for funding the congestion pricing plan. Since the final funding decision would be announced in August, Peters wrote in a letter to Governor Eliot Spitzer that if state approval was not met by July 16, [...] "it is unlikely that New York City would be selected." [...] Although a commitment was not established by that date, on July 19, the State legislature approved the creation of a 17-member commission that will study different plans to reduce traffic in the city, including congestion pricing.

6000|$|The Anti-Socialist {{argues that}} out of this evil of {{encouraged}} and stimulated avarice comes good, and that this peculiar meanly greedy type that predominates in the individualist world to-day, the Rockefeller-Harriman type, [...] "creates" [...] great businesses, exploits the possibilities of nature, gives mankind railways, power, commodities. As a matter of fact, a modern intelligent community is quite capable of doing all these things infinitely better for itself, and the beneficent influence of commerce may easily become, and does easily become, {{the basis of a}} cant. Exploitation by private persons is no doubt a necessary condition to economic development in an illiterate community of low intelligence, just as flint implements marked a necessary phase in the social development of mankind; but to-day the avaricious getter, like some obsolescent organ in the body, consumes strength and threatens health. And to-day he is far more mischievous than ever he was before, because of the weakened hold of the old religious organization upon his imagination. For the most part the great fortunes of the modern world have been built up by proceedings either not socially beneficial, or in some cases positively harmful. Consider some of the commoner methods of growing rich. There is first the selling of rubbish for money, exemplified by the great patent medicine fortunes and the fortunes achieved by the debasement of journalism, the sale of prize-competition magazines and the like; next there is forestalling, the making of [...] "corners" [...] in such commodities as corn, nitrates, borax and the like; then there is the capture of what Americans call [...] "franchises," [...] securing at low terms by expedients that usually will not bear examination, the right to run some profitable public service for private profit which would be better done in public hands--the various private enterprises for <b>urban</b> <b>traffic,</b> for example; then there are the various more or less complex financial operations, watering stock, [...] "reconstructing," [...] "shaking out" [...] the ordinary shareholder, which transfer the savings of the common struggling person to the financial magnate. All the activities in this list are more or less anti-social, yet it is by practising them that the great successes of recent years have been achieved. Fortunes of a second rank have no doubt been made by building up manufactures and industries of various types by persons who have known how to buy labour cheap, organize it well and sell its produce dear, but even in these cases the social advantage of the new product is often largely discounted by the labour conditions. It is impossible, indeed, directly one faces current facts, to keep up the argument of the public good achieved by men under the incentive of gain and the necessity of that incentive to progress and economic development.|$|E
