The present empirical research on recompense started with <b>an</b> analysis <b>of</b> the judgmental structures of recompense in legal thought and law, as such analysis has been neglected in prior research. The obtained results on recompense as stimulus and response reinforce the general idea of the present approach of using the framework of law and legal history in the empirical research of cognitive science.

40|$|We propose an {{experiment}} which demonstrates the <b>undoing</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> weak continuous measurement <b>of</b> <b>a</b> solid-state qubit, {{so that any}} unknown initial state is fully restored. The undoing procedure has only <b>a</b> finite probability <b>of</b> success because of the non-unitary nature of quantum measurement, though it {{is accompanied by a}} clear experimental indication {{of whether or not the}} undoing has been successful. The probability of success decreases with increasing strength of the measurement, reaching zero for a traditional projective measurement. Measurement undoing (``quantum un-demolition'') may be interpreted as <b>a</b> kind <b>of</b> <b>a</b> quantum eraser, in which the information obtained from the first measurement is erased by the second measurement, which is <b>an</b> essential part <b>of</b> the <b>undoing</b> procedure. The experiment can be realized using quantum dot (charge) or superconducting (phase) qubits. Comment: 5 page...|$|R
