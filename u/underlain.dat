40|$|Abstract—In an <b>underlay</b> {{cognitive}} radio network, the sec-ondary (<b>underlay)</b> transmitters generate interference to a pri-mary receiver, while an <b>underlay</b> receiver {{is subject to}} interfer-ence from both the primary transmitters and other <b>underlay</b> transmitters not associated with it. Although guard regions, maximum allowable <b>underlay</b> transmit powers, and contention distances help guarantee a minimum performance to the primary network, no such safeguard exists for the <b>underlay</b> network. To this end, this paper characterizes the aggregate interference on an <b>underlay</b> receiver while considering power control and receiver association schemes for both networks. Transmitters and receivers of both networks {{are assumed to be}} distributed as independent Poisson fields in the 2 -D plane, and all links undergo exponential path loss and Rayleigh fading. We derive the moment generating function of the aggregate interference on an <b>underlay</b> receiver and its outage probability. We show that the interference from the primary network does not depend on any node density, and that it dominates the aggregate interference. Furthermore, it is shown that increasing primary and <b>underlay</b> receiver densities reduce the outage probability under lower required power thresholds for the primary receivers. I...|$|R

The hills are nestled within higher peaks and the snow-clad Himalayan ranges tower over the town from the distance. Mount Kanchenjunga (8,598m or 28,208ft)—the world's third-highest peak—is visible {{to the west of the}} city. The existence of steep slopes, vulnerability to landslides, large forest cover and inadequate access to most areas have been a major impediment to the natural and balanced growth of the city.|$|E

Riverina soils are generally sandy along the river channels, with more saline grey and brown clays found on rarely flooded areas on the perimeter of the floodplain. As the Murrumbidgee passes downstream, the water and soil become more saline.|$|E

5|$|Exposed {{along the}} Cheakamus River {{and its tributaries}} are the Cheakamus Valley basalts. Although not {{necessarily}} mapped {{as part of the}} Cayley field, this sequence of basaltic lava flows is geologically similar and comparable in age to volcanic features that are part of this volcanic field. At least four basaltic flows comprise the sequence and were deposited during periods of volcanic activity from an unknown vent between 0.01and 1.6million years ago. Pillow lava is abundant along the bases the flows, some of which are <b>underlain</b> by hyaloclastite breccia. In 1958, Canadian volcanologist Bill Mathews suggested that the lava flows were erupted during periods of subglacial activity and traveled through trenches or tunnels melted in glacial ice of the Fraser Glaciation. Mathews based this on the age of the underlying till, the existence of pillow lava close to the bottom of some lavas, indicating subaqueous volcanism, the columnar jointing {{at the edges of the}} lavas, indicating rapid cooling, and the absence of apparent palaeogeography.|$|E
5|$|Formed by the {{confluence}} of three tiny headstreams on the southwest flank of Two Oceans Plateau in western Wyoming and Yellowstone National Park, the Snake starts out as a small river flowing west and south into Jackson Lake. Its first 50 miles (80 km) run through the valley of Jackson Hole, which cuts between the Teton Range and the Continental Divide. The Snake takes a large bend northwest through Snake River Canyon, cutting through the Snake River Range and into eastern Idaho, receiving first the Hoback and Greys rivers before entering Palisades Reservoir.

The plant was commissioned in 1980 and uses filtration and sedimentation techniques to clean water from the Mannum to Adelaide pipeline. It was the second plant in Adelaide, after the opening of the Hope Valley plant in 1977. Most of the water is piped directly from the River Murray, but some is sourced from Millbrook Reservoir.|$|E

An <b>underlay</b> lies in between overlay operations (e. g., data indexing, multicast, etc.) and the sensor network itself. Specifically, an <b>underlay</b> bridges the gap between (a) the unreliability of sensor nodes and communication and availability of only approximate location knowledge, and (b) {{the maintenance of a}} virtual geography-based naming structure that is required by several overlay operations. Our <b>underlay</b> creates a coarse naming scheme based on approximate location knowledge, and then maintains it in an e????cient and scalable manner. The <b>underlay</b> naming can be used to specify arbitrary regions.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} concept of <b>underlying</b> {{inflation}} and the properties of various measures of <b>underlying</b> inflation in the Australian context. <b>Underlying</b> inflation measures are routinely calculated and monitored by central banks in many countries, including the Reserve Bank of Australia. Alternative measurement concepts are explored, {{and a range of}} measures that have been calculated for Australia are discussed and evaluated on the basis of statistical criteria. These criteria capture the intuition that a good measure of <b>underlying</b> inflation should be less volatile than CPI (or headline) inflation, be unbiased with respect to CPI inflation, and capture the ‘trend’ in CPI inflation so that, on average, CPI inflation will tend to adjust towards the measure of <b>underlying</b> inflation. In the Australian context, statistical measures of <b>underlying</b> inflation, such as the trimmed mean or weighted median, perform fairly satisfactorily against these criteria. The performance of these measures can be further improved by seasonally adjusting prices at the CPI component level. Although <b>underlying</b> inflation measures have become less necessary in the past decade as inflation itself has become less volatile, these findings suggest that <b>underlying</b> inflation measures can still add value to the analysis of inflationary trends. <b>underlying</b> inflation; core inflation; trimmed mean; weighted median; volatility-weighted measures...|$|R
