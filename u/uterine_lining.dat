5|$|Combined {{hormonal}} contraceptives {{include both}} an estrogen and a progestogen. Estrogen negative {{feedback on the}} anterior pituitary greatly decreases the release of FSH, which makes combined hormonal contraceptives more effective at inhibiting follicular development and preventing ovulation. Estrogen also reduces the incidence of irregular breakthrough bleeding. Several combined hormonal contraceptives—the pill, NuvaRing, and the contraceptive patch—are usually used {{in a way that}} causes regular withdrawal bleeding. In a normal cycle, menstruation occurs when estrogen and progesterone levels drop rapidly. Temporarily discontinuing use of combined hormonal contraceptives (a placebo week, not using patch or ring for a week) has a similar effect of causing the <b>uterine</b> <b>lining</b> to shed. If withdrawal bleeding is not desired, combined hormonal contraceptives may be taken continuously, although this increases the risk of breakthrough bleeding.|$|E

Residential compounds are inherited in both the agnatic and the <b>uterine</b> <b>lines,</b> the relative proportion of each type of succession varying in the four villages under study. A compound may be divided into 'wards', 'kitchens', and, further down, 'uterine huts', each of these units corresponding to a specifie economic function. Starting from K. Gough's five types of residential categories, we define seven different patterns, the form most frequently found being the patrilocal extended family, the elementary family and a composite type of avuncular family, in that order. There is a significant correlation between residence patterns and inheritance of traditional offices. 'Kitchens' differ from compounds insofar {{as they can be}} matrilocal and chiefly consist of elementary families. While married sons often live in the same 'kitchen' with their fathers, nephews seldom cohabit with their MB. The 'uterine hut' is the primary unit of economic accumulation. The bilineal pattern of inheritance is also found in the four-level System of land-rights, with a correlation between land-rights and residence. Residential patterns and pre-ferential marriages tend to counterbalance the dispersal of a matrilineage's women resulting from virilocality.

50|$|Tube-like <b>uterine</b> glands, <b>lined</b> by ciliated {{columnar}} epithelium, {{are found}} in the functional layer of the uterine endometrium. Their appearance varies during the menstrual cycle. During the proliferative phase, uterine glands appear long due to estrogen secretion by the ovaries. During the secretory phase, the uterine glands become very coiled with wide lumens and produce a glycogen-rich secretion. This change corresponds with an increase in blood flow to spiral arteries due to increased progesterone secretion from the corpus luteum. During the pre-menstrual phase, progesterone secretion decreases as the corpus luteum degenerates, which results in decreased blood flow to the spiral arteries. The functional layer of the uterus containing the glands becomes necrotic, and eventually sloughs off during the menstrual phase of the cycle.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Endometrial {{cancer is}} the fourth most {{prominent}} cancer among all feminine cancers in the Western world. Resveratrol, a natural anti-oxidant found in red wine emerging as a novel anticancer agent, exerts antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic activity in various cancer cell types, but its effect on uterine cancer cells is poorly understood. At the molecular level, resveratrol {{has been reported to}} inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) expression and/or activity; in endometrial cancer cells, COX- 2 is overexpressed and confers cellular resistance to apoptosis. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine if resveratrol could exert anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activity over uterine cancer cells upon inhibition of COX- 2 expression and/or activity. Six different human <b>uterine</b> cancer cell <b>lines</b> were used as a model (HeLa, Hec- 1 A, KLE, RL 95 - 2, Ishikawa and EN- 1078 D). Results and discussion High-dose of resveratrol triggered apoptosis in five out of six <b>uterine</b> cancer cell <b>lines,</b> as judged from Hoechst nuclear staining and effector caspase cleavage. In accordance, uterine cancer cell proliferation was decreased. Resveratrol also reduced cellular levels of the phosphorylated/active form of anti-apoptotic kinase AKT. Endogenous COX- 2 protein levels were decreased, concomitant with a decrease in production of COX metabolites PGE 2 and PGF 2 α, in each <b>uterine</b> cancer cell <b>line</b> expressing detectable levels of COX- 1 and/or COX- 2 in presence of resveratrol. Although COX expression was identified as a target of resveratrol in uterine cancer cells, inhibition of COX activity or exogenously added PGE 2 did not modulate the effect of resveratrol on cellular proliferation. Conclusion High-dose of resveratrol exerts tumoricidal activity over uterine cancer cells and regulates COX expression. In these cells, resveratrol would not directly target COX activity, but possibly other enzymes involved in prostaglandin synthesis that act downstream of the COXs. </p...|$|R

Constriction of tortuous vessels by oblique muscle contraction is a major mechanism for hemostasis for most placental site, except for an abnormally invading area, and a uterotonic drug is positively used in the conservative management of leaving the placenta in situ [13].

40|$|Through the {{analysis}} of the Inca kinship terminology found in various historical sources, the author attempts to construct a theory of the system which accommodates all the data, whatever their apparent contradictions or inconsistencies might be. It is a bifurcated merging system displaying an obvious Omaha character (through extension of some of the kinship terms : MB=MBs), with some evidence, as well of asymetrical matrilateral cross-cousin marriage (MB, MBs = WF, WB, BWB, sWF, sWFF, ssWF). However, some of the terminology is clearly Crow in character, and this fact suggests the existence of the quite contrary Crow-type principle of reckoning as opposed to the Omaha-type principle (matrilineal us patrilineal). The author's hypothesis is that the two principles might be employed simultaneously in one and the same system, but in totally separate domains, in accordance with a principle of parallel descent, in the agnatic line for men and in the <b>uterine</b> <b>line</b> for women. Indeed, some terminological data (e. g a man uses the term ususi, daughter, for his dddd) constrain the author to posit three-generation cycles, which result from matrilateral cross-cousin marriage among just three unilineal descent groups (minimum number for the maintenance of asymmetry). The combinations among these various terminological features of the Inca kinship system imply that any matrilateral cross-cousin marriage is also a patrilateral one; in other words, the MBd {{is at the same time}} the FFSdd, in conformity with the paraleli descent principle. These conclusions are supported, at least with regard to parallel descent, by specific evidence concerning the transmission of names in historical times. The author also puts forward the hypothesis (which, however, is impossible to verify given the data available) that the Quechua of Cuzco during the Inca period did in fact conceive the matrilateral cross-cousin marriage as a marriage between a man and his F²Sd².

It is reported that liganded peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) stimulates Muc 1 expression in murine trophoblast. Here, we demonstrate that although the PPARγ ligand, rosiglitazone, stimulates the murine Muc 1 promoter in HEC 1 A, a human <b>uterine</b> epithelial cell <b>line,</b> rosiglitazone alone, has no significant effect on basal human MUC 1 promoter activity.

This response is antagonized by the PPARγ antagonist, GW 9662, {{as well as a}} dominant-negative form of PPARγ, demonstrating the response is mediated by PPARγ. Additional studies indicate that PPARγ activation does not change PR binding to the MUC 1 promoter but generally antagonizes progesterone activity by stimulating PRB degradation and inhibiting progesterone-induced PRB phosphorylation.

Directional chromosome walking studies starting from D 12 S 8 and the CHOP gene resulted in the isolation of a relatively large number of overlapping YAC clones, including Y 5355 (465 kbp), Y 7673 (360 kbp), and Y 9899 (275 kbp). In total, the inserts of these three YAC clones span an 800 kbp long and presumably contiguous stretch of human genomic DNA.
