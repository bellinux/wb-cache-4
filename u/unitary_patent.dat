40|$|The Court of Justice of the European Union has {{frequently}} {{been criticized for}} its allegedly pro-integration and almost pro-active judicial policy regarding the construction {{and the application of}} primary and secondary Union law. This paper aims at showing that, at least with respect {{to the development of a}} uniform case law on harmonized national and unified Community industrial property, the Court has had and still has to fulfil its unique task of informing national courts and the industrial property community in general as to the direction, in which European Union law is to evolve in the interest of the Union’s legal unity and of its independent industrial property policy. To this effect, a comparison is made between, on the one hand, the system of decentralized judicial review as it has been established with respect to both harmonized national copyright, trademark and design law, and unitary Community trademarks, designs and plant varieties, with, on the other hand, the recent proposals made for the conclusion of a “European Patent Litigation Agreement (EPLA) ” and for the creation by international agreement of a highly centralized “European and European Union Patent Court (EEUPC) ”. Both concern the settlement of litigation over infringement and validity of patents, the former relating only to national patents resulting from the bundle of patents granted by the European Patent Office at uniform conditions, the latter to both these <b>patents</b> and the <b>unitary</b> European Union <b>patent</b> (formerly the Community patent) as expected to be introduced by a Community regulation. More particularly, the paper critically assesses the relationship between the proposed inter-national EEUPC and the European Court of Justice. The draft agreement as currently under consideration by the Council of the European Union pretends at creating a workable link between the two different courts with a view to ensuring primacy of the Union’s law and uniformity of the application of its secondary law on patents. However, in reality the proposal tends to both severely reduce the role, which the European Court of Justice ought to play in the Union’s legal order, and to restrict the sovereign development of a forward looking, independent patent policy by the Union. This is so because, on the one hand, as a specialised and centralised high court, the EEUPC will by itself and by its very vocation ensure the development of a patent-specific “expert” case law and of its uniformity, and, on the other, because the inclusion of both the European and the European Union patent into one litigation agreement containing a full set of rules on the infringement and on the revocation of patents will exclude any unilaterally defined patent policy. As a result, patent law is vowed to develop in splendid isolation, and without the benefit of the guidance, which the European Court of Justice, it being a supreme court of general jurisdiction, has given and is called upon to give in other areas of the protection of industrial and intellectual property in the Union...|$|R

40|$|The {{problems}} technology based Small and Medium sized Entities (SMEs) face {{in their}} daily business´ regarding intimidation actions performed by financially stronger parties affect their business development activities. This {{is especially true for}} SMEs building their business from intellectual assets (IA) and intellectual property (IPR), such as patents, trademark, copyright, knowhow, databases etc. Financial strong actors have the ability to pin down SMEs by using litigation actions and by that get SMEs and their technologies stuck in court. Unfortunately, due to a weak and uncertain European patent system there are benefits for a large financial strong actor to perform intimidation strategies in order to gain competitive advantage. The current patent system contributes to a fragmentation of the European market which greatly challenges the possibilities of having the European market as the most competitive in the world. The thesis aims at setting out the key issues in order to reach satisfactory options and to shed light on the situation at hand To have a reasonable scope the thesis deals with SMEs on the European market facing infringement of their patents from financial strong actors. In the past there have been suggestions regarding how to deal with this issue. The thesis will go through a selected number of alternatives such as the development of patent litigation insurance schemes (PLI) on a European level and also the concept of patent defence uniom (PDU). These options mainly focus on, or have at least in the past, the need for financial aid. However, the costs of litigation {{are only part of the}} problem. Due to the current European patent system it has been extremely hard to make correct risk assessments, calculate costs, is it worth to patenting certain technologies etc. The patent system is seen as unreliable and therefore companies on the market seek for solutions outside the system. To investigate the matter further an analysis regarding the dispute resolution mechanisms litigation, arbitration and mediation was initiated. Since both the alternatives PLI and PDU have litigation as their primary resolution mechanism it is of interest to find out if there are any advantages to use alternative resolution procedures in relation to these concepts. The dispute resolution mechanisms have also been investigated in the light of both the current European patent system and the progress of a <b>unitary</b> EU level <b>patent.</b> The work is foremost based on information from reports presented or ordered from the EU Commission and national authorities within the EU member states. Unavoidable, there is first and foremost a need for a reliable and efficient European patent system. SMEs would greatly benefit from that and would also be able to stand up against large actors threatening with intimidation activities. Most likely there will no need for constructions such as PLI and PDU, at least from this perspective. In the long run the global welfare will decrease when business development activities can blossom at all levels on the European market. Let´s not forget that there are competing markets that offer an efficient market climate and by that forces European industry to move elsewhere...|$|R

A generic medicine is amedicinal product {{with the same}} qualitative and quantitative composition inactive substances and the same pharmaceutical form as the reference medicinalproduct (originator product), and whose bio-equivalence with the referencemedicinal product has been demonstrated by appropriate bio-availability studies. They possess that same quality, safety and efficacy compared to originatormedicines at prices {{which tend to be}} 20 - 80 % lower than their originatorequivalents. Part 1 of this project, the GeneralIntroduction, provides the definitions related to generic medicines andpresents an overview of the substantial savings which countries have obtainedthrough the use of them. Governments can implement a variety of policies toincrease the use of generic medicines, on both the supply- and the demand-side,which are described in Part 2 and Part 3. Studies on the supply-side have beenreported in Part 2. An overview of the regulatory framework regarding marketaccess of generic medicines in the European Union is provided in Chapter 2. 1. Hurdles which delay marketaccess of generic medicines are listed: defensive patenting strategies; patentlitigations; patent linkage and third-party interventions during the process ofobtaining marketing authorization and pricing and reimbursement decisions; andbacklogs in national approval systems are well-documented causes for delayedmarket access of generic medicines. A list of recommendations to enhance marketaccess of generic medicines in the European Union round off this chapter (e. g. theestablishment of a <b>unitary</b> European Union <b>patent</b> and a unified and specialisedpatent litigation system at European level; automatic approval of pricing andreimbursement decisions upon marketing authorization; and a reduction ofbacklogs in national agencies). Chapter 2. 2 describes the current status and impact ofgeneric medicine pricing policies in Europe. Competition from Indian genericmedicine manufacturers, European variation in generic medicine prices andcompetition between generic medicine manufacturers by discount suggest that thepotential savings from generic medicines to health care payers and patients arenot fully realized in Europe. One solution might be to move away fromcompetition by discount to competition by price. Free-pricing systems may drivemedicine prices downwards under specific conditions. In price-regulatedsystems, regulation may lower prices of both originator and generic medicines,but it may also remove incentives for additional price reductions beyond thoseimposed by regulation. The European experience suggests that there is not asingle approach towards developing generic medicine pricing policies in Europe. A relationship between the market share ofgeneric medicines and the change of the price level of medicines in off-patentmarkets was demonstrated in Chapter 2. 3. Market volumes increased in both high and low generic market share countries. Market values, on the other hand, decreased substantially in high genericmarket share countries while the decrease in low generic market share countrieswas limited. Medicine prices in high generic market share countries decreasedsubsequently more than prices in low generic market share countries. A survey was designed to assess thefeatures of tendering programs for outpatient prescription pharmaceuticals inEuropean countries, as described in Chapter 2. 4. Tendering is the acquisition of pharmaceuticals based on a competitivebidding process where the contract is granted to the pharmaceutical supplierswho offered the best bid following strict criteria. Only seven Europeancountries had adopted tendering programs for pharmaceuticals in ambulatory carein 2011. Tendering was more popular in countries with a mature genericmedicines market than in countries with a developing generic medicines market. A legal basis, criteria to grant the tender, the number of winners and theduration of the tender were amongst the crucial features for the programs towork. Some countries have achieved short-term savings on their pharmaceuticalbudgets, which was the main objective of tendering. There are however someproblems allied with the policy and the effects in the long term are stillunclear. An analysis of the impact of referencepricing systems in Europe rounds off Part 2, as described in Chapter 2. 5. A reference pricing systemestablishes a common reimbursement level or reference price for a group ofinterchangeable medicines, i. e. the reference group. Many European governmentshave introduced a reference pricing system to contain pharmaceuticalexpenditures by controlling the level of reimbursement. Reference pricingdrives down prices of drugs subject to it, but not always below the referenceprice. The use of medicines priced at or below the reference price increased andsavings on pharmaceutical expenditure were generated, albeit that they tend tobe limited to the short term. The long-term growth of drug expenditure did notseem to have reduced by reference pricing. No negative effect on healthoutcomes of patients was observed. Part 3 groups studies which have beenperformed on different aspects of the demand-side. Chapter 3. 1 provides a general overview of demand-side policieswhich have been implemented by European governments to encourage the use ofgeneric medicines. A plethora of different demand-side policies has alreadybeen initiated by different authorities, thereby targeting physicians,pharmacists and patients. The results have shown that positive knowledge andperceptions of generic medicines by physicians, pharmacists and patients arenecessary prerequisites to increase the use of generic medicines. Governmentsmust subsequently initiate appropriate policies to achieve this (e. g. academicdetailing programs and continuous medical education events for physicians andpharmacists and media campaigns for all stakeholders). These policies should becombined with policies to increase all stakeholders financial responsibilityto the healthcare system and policies to facilitate the prescribing anddispensing of generic medicines. Belgium has implemented a policy in 2006 whichobliges physicians to prescribe minimum quota of cheap medicines, as describedin Chapter 3. 2. All groups ofgeneral practitioners, specialists and dentists reached their minimumpercentages yearly from 2006 until 2009. The percentage of cheap medicines (indefined daily doses) increased from 22. 9 % in January 2005 to 44. 2 % of allprescribed medicines in ambulatory care in December 2009. The percentage ofgeneric medicines increased from 12. 10 % in 2004 to 24. 03 % of all prescribedmedicines in ambulatory care in 2008. The policy of prescribing quota for cheapmedicines was not only associated with an increased prescribing of genericmedicines during 2004 - 2008, but also increased the prescribing of originalmedicines whose price had dropped to the reference price level, as thesemedicines were included in the definition of cheap medicines. The potential forprescribing generic medicines has not yet been fully met in Belgium. Despitethe success of the policy, adjustments are desirable, especially with respectto the broad definition of cheap medicines. Pharmacists {{play an important role in}} thedevelopment of a generic medicines market. It is important that they are not financiallypenalized for dispensing generic medicines, which is currently the case in someEuropean countries, as demonstrated in Chapter 3. 3. Therefore, their remuneration should move towards afee-for-performance remuneration instead of a price-dependent remuneration,which is currently employed in many European countries. A fee-for-performanceremuneration would provide a stimulus for dispensing generic medicines, aspharmacists would not be financially penalized for dispensing them. Chapter 3. 4 rounds off Part 3 with calculations of possiblesavings through an increased use of generic medicines by elderly, as they arethe biggest users of medicines. The analysis showed that these savings wererather limited (4. 48 % when the generic market share by volume increase to 95 %). The full potential of generic medicines in the elderly population has not yetbeen realized in Belgium, due to the limited use of them and their relativehigh prices compared to their originator equivalents. The Belgian governmentshould implement additional incentives for physicians, pharmacists and patientsto increase the use of generics by elderly. These policies should be combinedby policies to lower prices of generic medicines and policies to rationalizethe prescribing of medicines for elderly, which should decrease the volume ofmedicines used by elderly subsequently. An analysis of the Spanish genericmedicines market is provided in Part 4. Spain is a highly decentralized country with 17 Autonomous Communities. Fundingand management of health care services, including pharmaceutical policies, isdecentralized and the responsibility of the regions since January 2002. The useof generic medicines in Spain is low compared to other European countries, bothin volume and value. We have provided an overview of the Spanish genericmedicines market and identified hurdles which impede its development. Recommendations o increase the sustainability of the Spanish generic medicinesmarket are proposed. Recommendations to increase the use of genericmedicines in Europe are proposed in the GeneralDiscussion in Part 5. These suggested policies are likely to work in allcountries throughout Europe, as they are policies which work independently ofthe different country-specific characteristics of health care systems. Theimpact of hospital policies regarding generic medicines is discussed, as thesedecisions may impact the future medication schemes in ambulatory care. Thechanging industrial landscape for pharmaceutical companies, with a tendency to pharmaceuticalcompanies combining both originator and generic divisions and the rise ofbiopharmaceuticals and biosimilars, is also discussed. Future research shouldfocus on the development of generic medicines in emerging markets andcountry-specific analyses of other European countries with limited use ofgeneric medicines. status: publishe...|$|R
