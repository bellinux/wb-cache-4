To enable switching algorithms that work well with the grids amplitude, phase-shift and frequency, the current waveform has to be measured and estimated.     There are many sources of noise that will add distortion of the current waveform, making its appearance less similar to the grids. The distorted measurement affects the accuracy of the converters negatively. Therefore, using a filter algorithm to attenuate the grid noise is required.   This project uses a Kalman filter with the aim to decrease the noise and estimate the current phase shift for a three phase power-grid.   To achieve reliable and fast calculation, implementing the Kalman filter within a FPGA were done. The project contains results from both simulated MATLAB data and the FPGAs real time data.

Among the various UPS topologies such as online UPS, offline UPS and line interactive UPS, online UPS are widely used. In this paper hardware implementation of single phase 50 Hz, online uninterruptable power supply with over voltage, under voltage and phase out protection have been carried. Atmega 32 microcontroller is the heart of the system and controls entire system. By programming the microcontroller using embedded C, SPWM pulses to drive H-bridge are generated.

Output of H-bridge is given to step up transformer to step up the voltage to 220 V, 50 Hz. The microcontroller is so programmed that at every instant it checks the voltage that is supplied to the load through sensors. At any instant if it detects that there is over voltage, under voltage or phase out, microcontroller acts to isolate the load from the power source by sending tripping signal to relay. Once relay isolates the load from the power source, microcontroller supplies the load through the charged battery.

To reduce harmonics, filters, power factor correction circuits and capacitor banks are required. And the development of hybrid technologies and renewable energy power stations trigger a demand for power converters with bi-directional capabilities. The objective of this thesis {{is to develop a}} high power quality, bi-directional AC-DC power converter that is a solution to the aforementioned problems. This thesis studies an existing topology for a high power AC-DC power conversion with transformer isolation. The topology consists of an uncontrolled rectifier followed by a DC-DC converter to produce a set voltage output. A design example of the topology is simulated using the PSIM software package (version 6). Critical performance characteristics such as power factor and total harmonic distortion are analyzed. Following that study a new topology is proposed, which is an improvement over the older design, with reduced power conversion stages. The new topology has a fully controlled current source Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) rectifier at the front end to replace the uncontrolled rectifier and DC-DC combination. This topology has multiquadrant operational capabilities and the controller employs Selective Harmonic Elimination techniques to produce the programmed PWM switching functions for the rectifier. A design example of the converter and the digital controller are simulated in PSIM environment. The converter input current THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) and input power factor are within IEEE 519 and DoE standards. The converter is simulated in both first and fourth quadrant operations. A side-by-side comparison of the two topologies is done with respect to design and performance features such as power factor, THD, filter size, etc. The new topology converter provides performance superior to that of the older topology.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{renewable}} energy installations connected to the utility grid {{is an important issue}} concerning the technical and economic viability of harnessing these emerging energy sources. Distribution networks must be carefully controlled in order to maintain an acceptable power supply quality. The major sources of non-conventional energy are small scale generation and storage from mini hydro, photovoltaic, wind power, fuel cells, battery, flywheel, pump storage and biomass. The aim of this thesis is to analyse the variation in voltage of the distribution network when renewable energy sources are interconnected to the distribution network, in terms of it's stability. In particular this study analyses the impact of interconnection of small synchronous generators to the <b>utility</b> <b>power</b> <b>grid.</b> Dynamic stability analysis is mainly concerned with analysing the response of electrical power system to small perturbation about a given operating point. These studies are particularly important due to the growing interest in interconnecting small renewable energy sources to large and complex power systems. Simulation studies were carried out in order to find out the transient stability and voltage stability of the non-conventional energy sources under different operating conditions. A 5 -second simulation was conducted using explicit numerical integration (Euler method) and an integration time step of 0. 002 second. Power System Toolbox was used for analysis. The multimachine power system models used in this thesis are generated in MATLAB code. The load flow is performed on the multimachine power system correponding to the loading condition to be investigated. The machines are represented by the two-axis models, the exciters by IEEE Type- 1 models and the loads are modelled as constant impedances. To save programming time, it has become common to limit the machine and exciter representations to some specified models. The network admittance matrix is reduced by retaining only the internal buses of the generators. The reduced network, machine and exciter data are then combined to form a linearised state-space model representing the entire system. The simulation studies are applied to a four machine ten bus system. It is clear from the analysis that much care should be taken based on the stability point of view while interconnecting the small renewable energy sources to the utility. The renewable energy sources should be interconnected at a point which provides higher stability margin. The renewable energy sources is a viable option if it is connected to the distribution network with necessary methods of improving transient stability and voltage stability...|$|E
40|$|Microgrids {{are small}} {{electrical}} power distribution networks {{that can be}} connected to a main <b>utility</b> <b>power</b> <b>grid,</b> or can operate in disconnected or islanded mode. They offer a potential solution to the world’s reliance on fossil fuel sourced electrical energy generation. They can improve energy security and reliability for customers connected to the microgrid. Microgrids usually incorporate distributed energy sources, including renewable sources. Many of the renewable sources are interfaced with power electronics which {{must be able to}} operate in conjunction with traditional forms of generation such as synchronous generators. Control of power electronic interfaced energy sources can pose challenges for coordinated control of the microgrid as a whole. The control systems main function is to ensure supply to critical loads is maintained, particularly when in islanded mode. This study investigated several strategies for control and management of a microgrid, including taking over voltage and frequency control in islanded mode. The distributed nature of energy sources that usually makes up a microgrid favours a control system with minimal communication infrastructure and {{that for the most part}} operates autonomously in both a grid connected and islanded mode. The current study investigated the general concepts for control of both centralised and decentralised configurations of a microgrid and the problems associated with each. In-depth investigations and simulations were carried out on two decentralised control strategies, a pure droop control method and an angle-frequency droop control method. The pure droop controller had the ability to autonomously perform equal power sharing and maintain stability in islanded mode of operation, but resulted in permanent steady state frequency offset. The angle-frequency droop also operated autonomously but with improved power sharing and frequency regulation. The investigation used the MATLAB® environment to perform calculations and carry out simulations of the proposed systems over a range of grid connected and islanded mode scenarios. Performance measures such as power sharing accuracy, disturbance transient behaviour and islanded-grid connection transition were used to assess the suitability of each control scheme. The P-f droop control has been widely reported on and has been proven to work over a range of conditions. The angle-frequency droop is a new proposal to improve the performance of a microgrid in islanded mode. Results demonstrated that both methods of control performed well in islanded mode. The angle-frequency droop had a slight increase in power sharing accuracy and superior frequency regulation. However it would appear that several design flaws may need addressing before the angle-frequency droop can be implemented as a truly decentralised topology...|$|E
