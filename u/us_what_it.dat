500|$|James M. Redfield, a {{classics}} {{professor at}} the University of Chicago, in his article [...] "An Aristotelian Analysis of Miss Moppet" [...] finds the story follows the tenets of Aristotle's Poetics, with a definite beginning (the unsuccessful attempt to catch the mouse), middle (Miss Moppet pretending to be hurt and catching the mouse), and end (Miss Moppet teasing the mouse and his escape). Redfield notes that Potter makes {{the outcome of the}} plot uncertain and creates parity between the characters, which are naturally predator and prey; Potter makes Miss Moppet [...] "young, inexperienced, female, and a pet", while the mouse is [...] "mature, courageous, male, and independent". Redfield praises Potter's skill as an author; she uses the hole in the duster twice—to allow Miss Moppet to catch the mouse, but then for him to escape her—and uses phrases particularly suited for a parent to read aloud to a child ("This is the mouse..."). Redfield concludes that while teasing is bad in the story—dangerous for the mouse, and cruel for the cat—Potter herself teases the reader in a good way, showing [...] "us that teasing is a kind of loving when {{it is a kind of}} teaching. The poet plays with us, and by taking us through an unreal experience, teaches <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is to live in the real world." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the Major Signs, a Companion of the Prophet narrated: [...] "Once we {{were sitting}} {{together}} and talking amongst ourselves when the Prophet appeared. He asked <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was we were discussing. We {{said it was the}} Day of Judgment. He said: 'It will not be called until ten signs have appeared: Smoke, Dajjal (the Antichrist), the creature (that will wound the people), the rising of the sun in the West, the Second Coming of Jesus, the emergence of Gog and Magog, and three sinkings (or cavings in of the earth): one in the East, another in the West and a third in the Arabian Peninsula.'" [...] (note: the previous events were not listed in the chronological order of appearance) ...|$|E
2500|$|Expression {{profiling}} is {{a logical}} next step after sequencing a genome: the sequence tells us what the cell could possibly do, while the expression profile tells <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is actually doing {{at a point in}} time. Genes contain the instructions for making messenger RNA (mRNA), but at any moment each cell makes mRNA from {{only a fraction of the}} genes it carries. [...] If a gene is used to produce mRNA, it is considered [...] "on", otherwise [...] "off". [...] Many factors determine whether a gene is on or off, such as the time of day, whether or not the cell is actively dividing, its local environment, and chemical signals from other cells. For instance, skin cells, liver cells and nerve cells turn on (express) somewhat different genes and that is in large part what makes them different. [...] Therefore, an expression profile allows one to deduce a cell's type, state, environment, and so forth.|$|E

2500|$|Kardashian {{appeared}} on the cover, and in a pictorial in Papers winter issue in 2014 photographed by Jean-Paul Goude. On the cover, her nude buttocks are featured above the caption: [...] "Break the Internet", which generated considerable comment in both social and traditional media. The photos show Kardashian with her hair tied up in a bun, wearing only a pearl necklace, a pair of earrings and black satin gloves, and, on the cover, with her bare back facing the camera, holding a sequined gown below her bare, oiled-up buttocks, while smiling broadly at the camera. A Time magazine writer commented that, unlike previous celebrities' nudes that represented the women's rebellion against repressed society and [...] "trying to tear down" [...] barriers, Kardashian's exhibition was [...] "just provocation and bluster, repeated images that seem to offer us some sort of truth or insight but are really just self serving. We want there to be something more, some reason or context, some great explanation that tells <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is {{like to live in}} this very day and age, but there is not. Kim Kardashian's ass is nothing but an empty promise." [...] However, the stunt [...] "set a new benchmark" [...] in social media response, and Papers website received 15.9 million views in one day, compared with 25,000 views on an average day.|$|E
