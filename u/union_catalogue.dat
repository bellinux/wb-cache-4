Ever since, libraries cooperated by negotiating ILL routing mechanisms using <b>Union</b> <b>Catalogues</b> as hubs to fulfill the enormous demands of their patrons. Since these <b>Union</b> <b>Catalogues</b> have been retro-converted into machine readable formats in the past decade, it was reasonable to use these data resources for an user friendly ILL service integrated into existing Digital Library infrastructures in Germany. The automated interlibrary loan network was born. The presentation will cover technical aspects and solutions, networking of existing regional networks into one nation-wide ILL service, and last not least regulations and financial affairs...|$|R

The serials' community is faced with a paradigm shift, which challenges existing publishing practices. <b>Union</b> <b>catalogues</b> have traditionally played a role in resource sharing, often in association with schemes of inter-library loan.

40|$|The United Kingdom boasts <b>union</b> <b>catalogues</b> for {{its major}} {{research}} libraries, journal holdings, archives and, most recently, for its public library collections. For researchers wanting to locate material across the UK, such aggregations have long {{served as a}} first stop for researchers wanting {{to find the right}} material and also provided a showcase for our formidable research collections. In the global networked environment, search engines and social networks can fulfil much of the functionality of <b>union</b> <b>catalogues</b> and have become the natural places to which our users go for search and discovery, even in academic situations. Right now, there is a ‘disconnect’ between the data describing our collections and the places users first turn to start their searches. This can be fixed by exposing descriptive data to wider audiences beyond the silo of the local catalogue, but data publishing is a fast moving area with little obvious short-term institutional-level gain and some start-up barriers. Publishing library data to the open web at the level of a national aggregation would utilize existing skill sets and infrastructure, minimize risk and maximize impact...|$|R
