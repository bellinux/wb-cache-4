25|$|In {{point of}} fact, the short fiction {{in the series}} {{frequently}} provides a more in-depth background and foreshadows larger events that are the meat of the long fiction in the series. The longer works are replete with mentions to events covered in the shorter works, and with characters and the history and events unfolded in such materials. Flint always publishes {{one of his own}} stories within the short fiction collections, {{or in the case of}} , considerably more, as it introduces several important background factors that are central to further series developments as the altered history is to <b>unfold</b> <b>to</b> the reader.|$|E
25|$|These {{vehicles}} {{could be}} divided into three sub-categories. Modified trucks equipped with water cannons, modified stock cars and modified APCs (Armored Personnel Carriers). Their function is to help control riots. Modified stock cars will have caged windows for protection against objects thrown at them and could include mini-buses, 4x4s or prisoner transport vans. APCs usually will not require any added protection but their modifications might include some sort of tear gas ejecting method or shields that <b>unfold</b> <b>to</b> create barriers. The water cannon vehicles are used either to break up riots or extinguish fires set by the rioters. Although plain water is usually used some variations might include tear gas or special dye (to mark {{the people that are}} present for later apprehension). Previously fire trucks were used as anti-riot vehicles of this type. As a non lethal, and effective method of clearing out protesters or rioters, the Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD) can be used. The LRAD is a device that can send announcements, warnings, and harmful pain-inducing tones.|$|E

2500|$|Pearson {{signed the}} Canada–United States Automotive Agreement (or Auto Pact) in January 1965, and {{unemployment}} fell {{to its lowest}} rate in over a decade. While in office, Pearson declined U.S. requests to send Canadian combat troops into the Vietnam War. Pearson spoke at Temple University in Philadelphia on 2 April 1965, while visiting the United States and voiced his support for a pause in the American bombing of North Vietnam, so that a diplomatic solution to the crisis may <b>unfold.</b> <b>To</b> President Lyndon B. Johnson, this criticism of American foreign policy on American soil was an intolerable sin. Before Pearson had finished his speech, he was summoned to Camp David, Maryland, to meet with Johnson the next day. Johnson, who was notorious for his personal touch in politics, reportedly grabbed Pearson by the lapels and shouted, [...] "Don't you come into my living room and piss on my rug." ...|$|E
2500|$|Peroxisomes can {{be derived}} from the {{endoplasmic}} reticulum and replicate by fission. Peroxisome matrix proteins are translated in the cytoplasm prior to import. Specific amino acid sequences (PTS or peroxisomal targeting signal) at the C-terminus (PTS1) or N-terminus (PTS2) of peroxisomal matrix proteins signals them to be imported into the organelle. There are at least 32 known peroxisomal proteins, called peroxins, which participate in the process of peroxisome assembly. Proteins do not have to <b>unfold</b> <b>to</b> be imported into the peroxisome. The protein receptors, the peroxins PEX5 and PEX7, accompany their cargoes (containing a PTS1 or a PTS2 amino acid sequence, respectively) [...] all the way into the peroxisome where they release the cargo and then return to the cytosol – a step named recycling. A model describing the import cycle {{is referred to as the}} extended shuttle mechanism. There is now evidence that ATP hydrolysis is required for the recycling of receptors to the cytosol. Also, ubiquitination appears to be crucial for the export of PEX5 from the peroxisome, to the cytosol.|$|E

6000|$|Before {{returning}} to Condorcet {{we ought to}} glance at the remarkable piece, written in 1784, in which Kant propounded his idea of a universal or cosmo-political history, which contemplating the agency of the human will upon a large scale should <b>unfold</b> <b>to</b> our view a regular stream of tendency in the great succession of events.[55] The will metaphysically considered, Kant said, is free, but its manifestations, that is to say, human actions, 'are as much {{under the control of}} universal laws of nature as any other physical phenomena.' ...|$|E

60|$|From the {{atmosphere}} of Lyndwood Park and its surroundings--fragrant, almost epicurean--Maraton passed to the hard squalor of the great smoke-hung city of the north. There were no beautiful women or cultured men to bid him welcome. The Labour Member and his companion, who hastened {{him out of the}} train at Derby and into an open motor-car, were hard-featured Lancashire men, keen on their work and practical as the day. As they talked together in that long, ugly ride, Maraton almost smiled as he thought of those perfervid dreams of his which had always been {{at the back of his}} head; that creed of life, some part of which he had intended to <b>unfold</b> <b>to</b> the people during these few days.|$|E
6000|$|But {{perhaps the}} least {{readable}} of silly women’s novels are the modern-antique species, which <b>unfold</b> <b>to</b> us the domestic life of Jannes and Jambres, the private love affairs of Sennacherib, or the mental struggles and ultimate conversion of Demetrius the silversmith. From most silly novels {{we can at}} least extract a laugh; but those of the modern-antique school have a ponderous, a leaden kind of fatuity, under which we groan. What can be more demonstrative of the inability of literary women to measure their own powers than their frequent assumption of a task which can only be justified by the rarest concurrence of acquirement with genius? The finest effort to reanimate the past is of course only approximative—is always more or less an infusion of the modern spirit into the ancient form— ...|$|E
