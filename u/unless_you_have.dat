25|$|Isothermal - This model {{assumes that}} the {{compressed}} gas remains at a constant temperature throughout the compression or expansion process. In this cycle, internal energy {{is removed from the}} system as heat at the same rate that it is added by the mechanical work of compression. Isothermal compression or expansion more closely models real life when the compressor has a large heat exchanging surface, a small gas volume, or a long time scale (i.e., a small power level). Compressors that utilize inter-stage cooling between compression stages come closest to achieving perfect isothermal compression. However, with practical devices perfect isothermal compression is not attainable. For example, <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> an infinite number of compression stages with corresponding intercoolers, you will never achieve perfect isothermal compression.|$|E

25|$|<b>Unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> secret incriminating {{evidence}} against Furtwängler supporting your accusation {{that he was}} a tool of Nazi Party, I beg to take violent issue with your decision to ban him. The man never was a Party member. Upon numerous occasions, he risked his own safety and reputation to protect friends and colleagues. Do not believe that the fact of remaining in one's own country is alone sufficient to condemn a man. On the contrary, as a military man, you would know that remaining at one's post often requires greater courage than running away. He saved, and for that we are deeply his debtors, the best part of his own German culture... I believe it patently unjust and most cowardly for us to make of Furtwängler a scapegoat for our own crimes. If the man is guilty of specific crimes, accuse him and convict him. As far as I can see, it is no punishment to be banned from sordid, filthy Berlin and if the man now old and ill is willing and anxious to return to his exacting task and responsibilities he should be encouraged for that is where he belongs, right in Berlin...|$|E
500|$|Jim Bambra {{reviewed}} the re-released G module series very positively in issue 35 of White Dwarf magazine, awarding 10 out of 10. Bambra liked the reprinting of the modules, stating that [...] "their printing under one cover {{has reduced the}} price at no detriment to the quality." [...] He noted that the original tournament characters are included, although they {{were not included in}} the original three separate modules, and that not all of them conform to the rules in the Players Handbook. Two spells were also added, which had been absent from the original modules. Bambra says that he [...] "would suggest not playing these <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been playing for a few years, success depends more on player skill than on high character levels and DMing adventures of this level can be a nightmare <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> had plenty of experience." ...|$|E

500|$|It was {{not until}} Wenger's arrival in October 1996 that Arsenal reemerged as a serious league competitor. By {{the end of the}} 1996–97 season, Manchester United amassed their fourth title in five seasons, whereas Arsenal {{finished}} the campaign in third – their highest position since the formation of the Premier League in 1992. During the season, Wenger commented on rule changes which permitted an extension to the league calendar: [...] "It's wrong the programme is extended so Manchester United can rest and win everything." [...] His observation irked Ferguson, who replied: [...] "He has no experience of English football. He has come here from Japan, and now he is telling everyone how to organise our football. <b>Unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been in the situation and had the experience then he should keep his mouth shut, firmly shut." ...|$|E

When asked to explain further, Biden spokesperson Margaret Aitken stated [...] "The Senator [...] admires, supports and respects the Indian-American community... The point Senator Biden was making {{is that there has}} been a vibrant Indian-American community in Delaware for decades. It has primarily been made up of engineers, scientists and physicians, but more recently, middle-class families are moving into Delaware and purchasing family-run small businesses..." [...] The Indian-American activist who was on the receiving end of Biden's comment later called the media coverage of Biden's comments [...] "completely unfair," [...] and stated that he was [...] "100 percent behind (Biden) because he did nothing wrong." ...|$|E
500|$|Air Force {{running back}} Leotis Palmer {{was having the}} best season of his career heading into the San Francisco Bowl. During the regular season, he {{accumulated}} 537rushing yards, four rushing touchdowns and 113passing yards for two touchdowns. Palmer and the Falcons had already clinched the season's rushing title, cementing their status as the No.1 rushing team in the country after West Virginia—the second-place team—failed to gain sufficient yardage in its final game to pass the Falcons. Despite finishing with the top-ranked rushing offense, none of Air Force's offensive linemen received postseason honors. [...] "It should give our players a lot of incentive for next year. Hopefully, if we repeat next year, maybe we'll get two or three on there. You certainly don't accumulate the number of yards we do <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> people up front doing their job," [...] DeBerry said at the time.|$|E

500|$|This hypothesis, {{although}} not perfect, perhaps best explains the evidence. Eighteen {{months prior to}} an October 1984 conference on lunar origins, Bill Hartmann, Roger Phillips, and Jeff Taylor challenged fellow lunar scientists: [...] "You have eighteen months. Go back to your Apollo data, {{go back to your}} computer, do whatever you have to, but make up your mind. Don't come to our conference <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> something to say about the Moon's birth." [...] At the 1984 conference at Kona, Hawaii, the giant impact hypothesis emerged as the most popular. Before the conference, there were partisans of the three [...] "traditional" [...] theories, plus a few people who were starting to take the giant impact seriously, and there was a huge apathetic middle who didn’t think the debate would ever be resolved. Afterward there were essentially only two groups: the giant impact camp and the agnostics.|$|E
500|$|Biden made remarks {{during the}} {{campaign}} that attracted controversy. On {{the day of his}} January 2007 announcement, he spoke of fellow Democratic candidate and Senator Barack Obama: [...] "I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy, I mean, that's a storybook, man." [...] This comment undermined his campaign as soon as it began and significantly damaged his fund-raising capabilities; it later took second place on Time magazine's list of Top 10 Campaign Gaffes for 2007. Biden had earlier been criticized in July 2006 for a remark he made about his support among Indian Americans: [...] "I've had a great relationship. In Delaware, the largest growth in population is Indian-Americans moving from India. You cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin' Donuts <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a slight Indian accent. I'm not joking." [...] Biden later said the remark was not intended to be derogatory.|$|E
500|$|The {{experience}} of the M3 in the North African Campaign was completely different. The gun was not powerful {{enough to deal with}} late production German Panzer III and IV tanks. After the nearly disastrous Battle of Kasserine Pass in February 1943, reports from some of the involved units mentioned 37mm projectiles [...] "bouncing off like marbles" [...] from the turret and front armor of German medium tanks and proclaimed the gun [...] "useless <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> gun crews with the guts to stand and shoot from 100yards". The Army was initially uncertain if these reports reflected the obsolescence of the weapon, or whether unrefined tactics and lack of experience were to blame. Yet, on 26 May 1943, a new organization had the M3 replaced by the 57mm Gun M1 (the U.S.-produced version of the British 6-pounder gun), with Dodge 1½ ton trucks as prime movers. Only by spring 1944 did the 57mm gun reach the battlefield in large numbers.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} year Grant was {{considered for the}} Academy Award for Best Actor for Penny Serenade—his first nomination from the academy. Wansell claims that Grant found the film to be an emotional experience, because he and wife-to-be Barbara Hutton had started to discuss having their own children. Later that year he appeared in the romantic psychological thriller Suspicion, the first of Grant's four collaborations with director Alfred Hitchcock. Grant did not warm to co-star Joan Fontaine, finding her to be temperamental and unprofessional. Film critic Bosley Crowther of The New York Times considered that Grant was [...] "provokingly irresponsible, boyishly gay and also oddly mysterious, as the role properly demands". Hitchcock later stated that he thought {{the ending of the}} film in which Grant is sent to jail instead of committing suicide [...] "a complete mistake because of making that story with Cary Grant. <b>Unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a cynical ending it makes the story too simple". Geoff Andrew of Time Out believes Suspicion served as [...] "a supreme example of Grant's ability to be simultaneously charming and sinister".|$|E
500|$|Lajoie's {{dissatisfaction with}} the Naps' play worsened. [...] "You can't win {{in the major leagues}} <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> players who know the game. We don't have time to teach and train youngsters up here. Our job is to win pennants, not run schools", he said. Franklin Lewis, sports writer and author, wrote [...] "Lajoie, in spite of his {{marvelous}} fielding and tremendous batting, was not exactly a darling of the grandstand as a manager." [...] Lajoie recommended to Somers on August 17, 1909, he find the team a new manager, although he wanted to remain on the club as a player. Somers responded to Lajoie by giving him more time to finalize his decision but when Lajoie came back days later and announced the same decision, Somers acted quickly to find a replacement. Lajoie later described the decision to take on the added duties as a player-manager as the biggest mistake of his career as he felt it negatively affected his play. The highest-paid player in the league, he also offered a $10,000 ($ in current dollar terms) reduction in salary. Somers promoted Naps coach Deacon [...] "Jim" [...] McGuire to manager. The team finished 7182 while Lajoie's [...]324 average was third in the AL and 33 doubles second. The Naps finished 1910 7181 but Lajoie had one of his better seasons statistically as he led the majors with a [...]384 average and 227 hits, both categories bettered only in Lajoie's 1901 campaign. His 51 doubles, a career-high, and 304 total bases led the majors, the fourth and final time in his career he would lead the majors in the latter category. Lajoie missed significant parts of back-to-back seasons, the first in 1911 when he appeared in just 90 games. Stovall, the former Naps first baseman, replaced McGuire as the club's manager and the Naps finished 8073. Lajoie was forced to sit out six weeks of the 1912 season when he sprained his back in May during a practice session in Chicago. He played in 117 games on the season, an increase of the 90 he played in one season before, but Cleveland, who had hired Joe Birmingham as the team's fifth manager since Lajoie gave up the role in 1909, finished 7578. Lajoie and Joe Jackson tied for the team lead with 90 RBIs. He finished fourth in the AL with a [...]368 batting average. In 1913, Birmingham and Lajoie had arguments in the open, including one incident in June when Lajoie cursed Birmingham openly to reporters after being benched during a batting slump. Lajoie hit [...]335 on the year, the last time he would hit over [...]300 in his career.|$|E

2500|$|In late May, {{there would}} be a Grand Review of the Armies, where the Union Army would parade through the streets of Washington. Halleck offered the {{hospitality}} of his home to Sherman; the general bluntly refused. He informed Grant of his rejection, stating as well that he would only listen to orders from Stanton if they were explicitly sanctioned by the President as well. Sherman further stated that [...] "retraction or pusillanimous excusing" [...] would no longer cut it. The only thing acceptable to Sherman would be for Stanton to declare himself a [...] "common libeller".

2500|$|Generally {{the use of}} both a {{ring and}} a halter, and {{management}} of the bull by two people, is the preferred method today for controlling the bull. [...] Typically, a bull was led by a wooden staff with a steel end that snapped into the ring. A long rigid steel or wooden bull staff locked into the ring could also be used to push a bull out of a pen without requiring the handler to enter the pen for cleaning or feeding. Because of the risk that the bull may drive the staff into the handler if the bull misbehaves many handlers prefer to avoid their use nowadays. [...] One current veterinary text still recommends the use of a staff in addition to the halter: Many handlers rely on a nose ring to control a bull. [...] But a ring in his nose is no good <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a bull staff and use it. [...] A bull staff is a pole with a snap in the end that clips to the bull ring. [...] Leading a bull with a staff gives you a lot more handling power as the bull can't get any closer to you than the length of the staff allows. Leading him only by a chain in the ring lets him run over you at will.|$|E
