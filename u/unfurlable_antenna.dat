40|$|Spacecraft {{components}} {{are expected to}} withstand intensive launch loads and withstand adverse environmental conditions that are encountered during the space mission. These {{components are}} tested rigorously and performance test procedures are {{used to evaluate the}} components for qualification and acceptance decisions. The work reported in this paper demonstrates the development of FMECA analysis for the stringent performance standards that is expected of the DC brush motors, which are used to power the deployment mechanism of the <b>unfurlable</b> <b>antenna</b> in a spacecraft. The DC Brush motors are one of the critical components in the space module. The rigorous testing of the DC brush motors yield a large number of failures occurring during the test. This paper highlights the analysis of failure events observed in DC brush motors using the FMECA Technique. This work adds value to the decision making process in the organisation by analysing the performance failures using the FMECA methodology. The corrective measures suggested through the analysis, helps the decision makers in qualifying the Components based on the performance tests...|$|E

It is arranged in three groups of four plus one spare amplifiers of 24 Watts each. The transponders work on the 2.5 GHz to 2.6 GHz frequency. The C band transponder is powered by one plus one spare 13 Watt solid state amplifier and works on the 4 GHz and 6 GHz frequency band.|$|R
40|$|Following {{a theory}} {{briefing}} on the currents in a plasma of mixed species {{caused by the}} motion of charged particles, the paper presents {{a report on the}} observations of regions of the magnetosphere in which significant values of grad E (E being the electric field) can be inferred from measurements of E made on board the IMP 6 satellite using two pairs of long (91. 5 m and 45. 7 m) <b>unfurlable</b> <b>antenna</b> sensors. Electric fields were measured by applying double floating probe techniques to the antenna sensors, and grad E values of up to 1. 4 / 1000 emu were inferred from the fluctuations in E along the orbit. The critical values of grad E for various ions, in a range of magnetic fields are compared, and the difference in the behavior of Ba+ ions which cause Ba+ currents in the subcritical and supercritical regions is discussed. The results show that the electric currents flowing in the E x B direction may cause secondary polarization fields on the barium cloud. The possible significance of these effects to natural geophysical phenomena is also pointed out...|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] - DC {{brush motor}} {{undergoes}} rigorous performance testing {{to predict the}} failures occurring. Acceptance test levels are set with margin expected flight/operations levels and qualification test levels are set above the expected operation levels to check for the survivability of DC brush motor in space. Performance testing is important to design and integration in a planned test process in which DC brush motor were tested under actual or simulated mission profile environments to disclose design deficiencies and to provide information on failure modes and mechanisms. Statistical models are helpful in this process. The Logistic Regression Model is the commonly used parametric statistical models {{and is one of}} the statistical techniques that are used for analyzing and predicting performance with binary outputs. The objective was to develop Logistic Regression Model and is designed to examine the categorization of dependent variables in the quantitative analysis for the performance of DC brush motor. The work carried out demonstrates the development of the Logistic Regression Model for performance prediction of the DC brush motors for deploying <b>unfurlable</b> <b>antenna.</b> The methodology includes performance test data and transforming the dependent variables into binary digits. And to estimate the probability of success of DC brush motor. The model developed is useful in the GO-NO-GO decision making with regard to the DC brush motors which is one of the critical components in the space module. This paper adds value to the decision making process through statistical validation using Logistic Regression Model. This Model helps the decision makers in qualifying the components based on performance tests. The Model developed shows the working condition of motor can said to be good since the model fit is good. The reliability performance of the DC brush motor in the working condition is significantly good...|$|E
40|$|Contactless {{information}} retrieval using electromagnetic waves plays {{an increasingly important}} role for scientific and industrial progress. In particular the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) principle, numbered among the imaging techniques, nowadays belongs to the standard-repertoire of civil and military Earth observation. Future SAR systems, whose performance significantly depends on the employed hardware {{as well as the}} data processing, shall map increasingly large areas in shorter and shorter time intervals. The work at hand deals with sensor systems, whose two main parts encompass antenna techniques, as well as the subsequent analog and digital signal processing. Here, the focus lies on digital beamforming techniques, enabling an efficient operation of the SAR sensor. For this, space-time adaptive algorithms are derived, which are suitable to minimize the system noise of the sensor and to suppress spatial interference. These algorithms are simulated using the example of a spaceborne SAR system, where the innovative concept of a large unfoldable reflector in combination with a digital feed array is employed. The purpose of such a radar type is to digitize the electromagnetic signal almost immediately after the receiver, in order to ensure the maximal flexibility of the SAR system and to save costs for expensive analog electronics at the same time. The second emphasis of this work deals with optimization aspects, where amongst others a new method is proposed, which allows to mitigate an inherent problematic of such reflector-feed-array constellations. Since {{in the event of a}} failure of a single or multiple elements of the feed array a blind spot in the field of view is generated, as solution a defocused reflector antenna concept is proposed. Such an antenna concept combines the merit of planar array antennas, namely the preservation of the functionality in case of an antenna element failure, with the advantage of <b>unfurlable</b> reflector <b>antennas,</b> which is the realization of large apertures...|$|R
