25|$|Internet {{and digital}} privacy are viewed {{differently}} from traditional expectations of privacy. Internet privacy is {{primarily concerned with}} protecting <b>user</b> <b>information.</b> Law Professor Jerry Kang explains that the term privacy expresses space, decision, and information. In terms of space, individuals have an expectation that their physical spaces (i.e. homes, cars) not be intruded. Privacy {{within the realm of}} decision is best illustrated by the landmark case Roe v. Wade. Lastly, information privacy is in regards to the collection of <b>user</b> <b>information</b> from a variety of sources, which produces great discussion.|$|E
25|$|Facebook, Inc. v. Power Ventures, Inc. is {{a lawsuit}} brought by Facebook in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that Power Ventures Inc., a {{third-party}} platform, collected <b>user</b> <b>information</b> from Facebook and displayed {{it on their}} own website. Facebook claimed violations of the CAN-SPAM Act, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act ("CFAA"), and the California Comprehensive Computer Data Access and Fraud Act. According to Facebook, Power Ventures Inc. made copies of Facebook’s website during the process of extracting <b>user</b> <b>information.</b> Facebook argued that this process causes both direct and indirect copyright infringement. In addition, Facebook alleged this process constitutes a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"). Finally, Facebook also asserted claims of both state and federal trademark infringement, as well as a claim under California's Unfair Competition Law ("UCL").|$|E
25|$|On July 26, 2016 a new, {{mid-range}} {{model with}} only an on-screen keyboard was introduced, the unusually slim BlackBerry DTEK50, {{powered by the}} latest version of Android (6.0, Marshmallow) and featuring a 5.2-inch full high-definition display. BlackBerry chief security officer David Kleidermacher stressed data security during the launch, indicating that this model included built-in malware protection and encryption of all <b>user</b> <b>information.</b> By then, the BlackBerry Classic, which used the BlackBerry 10 OS, had been discontinued.|$|E
40|$|In {{the task}} of {{adaptive}} information filtering, a system receives a stream of documents but delivers only those that match a person's information need. As the system filters it also refines its knowledge about the <b>user's</b> <b>information</b> needs based on relevance feedback from the user. Delivering a document thus has two e#ects: i) it satisfies the <b>user's</b> <b>information</b> need immediately, and ii) it helps the system better satisfy the user in the future by improving its model of the <b>user's</b> <b>information</b> need. The traditional approach to adaptive information filtering fails to recognize and model this second e#ect...|$|R

40|$|Combining the {{language}} model and inference network, as {{implemented in the}} Indri search engine, is efficient and verified approach. In this retrieval model, the <b>user’s</b> <b>information</b> need is exhibited as Indri’s Structural Query Language. Although the SQL allows expert users to richly represent its information needs but unfortunately, the complicacy of SQLs make them unpopular in the WEB for ordinary ones. Au-tomatically detecting the concepts in a <b>user’s</b> <b>information</b> need and generate a richly structured equivalent query is a good solution. It needs a concept repository {{and a way to}} extracting appropriate concepts from the <b>user’s</b> <b>information</b> need. We utilize Wikipedia as a great, multilingual, free-content encyclopedia for our knowledge base and also some state of the art algorithms for extracting Wikipedia’s concepts from the <b>user’s</b> <b>information</b> need. This process is called “Query Wikification”. Mining Wikipedia concept repository help us to propose a solution that supports usability in multilingual environments, cross-language retrievals, scalability and covering erra-tum, various equivalents and synonyms of a concept.

25|$|Access to Jet {{databases}} {{is done on}} a per user-level. The <b>user</b> <b>information</b> is kept in {{a separate}} system database, and access is controlled on each object in the system (for instance by table or by query). In Jet 4, Microsoft implemented functionality that allows database administrators to set security via the SQL commands CREATE, ADD, ALTER, DROP USER and DROP GROUP. These commands are a subset of ANSI SQL 92 standard, and they also apply to the GRANT/REVOKE commands. When Jet 2 was released, security could also be set programmatically through DAO.|$|E
25|$|On July 14, 2008, Viacom {{compromised}} {{to protect}} YouTube users' personal data in their $1billion copyright lawsuit. Google agreed it will anonymize <b>user</b> <b>information</b> and internet protocol addresses from its YouTube subsidiary before handing the data over to Viacom. The privacy deal also applied to other litigants including the FA Premier League, the Rodgers & Hammerstein {{organization and the}} Scottish Premier League. The deal however did not extend the anonymity to employees, because Viacom wishes to prove that Google staff {{are aware of the}} uploading of illegal material to the site. The parties therefore will further meet on the matter lest the data be made available to the court.|$|E
25|$|In the United States the FISA act (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) {{along with}} the {{amendments}} made to it in 2008 {{can be considered a}} similar bill to that of the Canadian bill C-30. The FISA protects telecommunications companies complicit in providing <b>user</b> <b>information</b> to federal law enforcement authorities. In addition to this the 2008 amendments, which were extended another five years at the end of 2012, allow the NSA (National Security Agency) to conduct electronic surveillance on any US citizen suspected of conversing with any person outside of the USA suspected by the US government of terrorist activities. No warrant is needed for the execution of surveillance over American citizens, which is the central issue privacy and rights’ activists have had with this legislation.|$|E

Among the information stolen were records of two users who subscribed using email addresses {{associated with the}} Malaysian government, three users who subscribed using United States military email addresses and 55 users who LulzSec claimed were administrators of other adult-oriented websites. Following the breach, Facebook locked the accounts of all users who had used the published e-mail addresses, and also blocked new Facebook accounts opened using the leaked e-mail addresses, fearing that users of the site would get hacked after LulzSec encouraged people to try and see if these people used identical user name and password combinations on Facebook as well.|$|E
