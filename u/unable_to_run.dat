5|$|Although Hitler had {{terminated}} his Austrian {{citizenship in}} 1925, {{he did not}} acquire German citizenship for almost seven years. This meant that he was stateless, legally <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for public office, and still faced the risk of deportation. On 25 February 1932, the interior minister of Brunswick, Dietrich Klagges, {{who was a member}} of the NSDAP, appointed Hitler as administrator for the state's delegation to the Reichsrat in Berlin, making Hitler a citizen of Brunswick, and thus of Germany.|$|E

Third fastest was Sergio Pérez for Force India, although he was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> in the last twenty minutes of the session due to brake issues. The Red Bull drivers Kvyat and Ricciardo were fourth and sixth respectively, while Fernando Alonso came within one second of Rosberg's time in ninth.|$|E

5|$|McNary's father helped on {{the family}} farm, then taught school {{for a few years}} before {{returning}} to farming near Salem. When McNary's mother died in 1878, his father moved the family to Salem where he bought a general merchandise store after being <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> the family farm because of declining health. Charles, known as Tot, began his education at a one-room school in Keizer and later attended Central School in Salem, living on North Commercial Street. Hugh McNary died in 1883, making Charlie an orphan at the age of nine.|$|E
5|$|Some winter service vehicles, {{especially}} those {{designed for use}} on footpaths or pedestrian zones, are built on a far smaller chassis using small tractors or custom made vehicles. These vehicles are often multi-purpose, and can be fitted with other equipment such as brushes, lawnmowers or cranes—as these operations are generally <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> during heavy snowfalls, there is generally little overlap between the different uses, reducing {{the size of the}} fleet required by the agency or contractor.|$|E
5|$|The Klondike's {{choice of}} {{programming}} earned it a negative reputation, and Towne Cinema was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> the Klondike profitably. The company sought buyers for the theatre {{as early as}} 1976, asking $600,000. But, despite all of the theatre's problems under Towne Cinema, {{it is unlikely that}} it would have been returned to its original use without the money they poured into its renovation. Their efforts to restore the building are a significant reason why the Princess is a cinema today.|$|E

He was supposed to begin his professional baseball career in the Kentucky–Illinois–Tennessee League that year, but he found himself <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> {{as fast as he}} previously could. Doc Bennett, the manager of a nearby semi-professional team, suggested that Ruffing should try to continue pursuing a baseball career by becoming a pitcher.|$|E
5|$|Brazilian flex {{cars are}} capable of running on just {{hydrated}} ethanol (E100), or just on a blend of gasoline with 20 to 25%anhydrous ethanol, or on any arbitrary combination of both fuels. Pure gasoline is no longer sold in the country because these high ethanol blends are mandatory since 1993. Therefore, all Brazilian automakers have optimized flex vehicles to run with gasoline blends from E20 to E25, so these FFVs are <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> smoothly with pure gasoline {{with the exception of}} two models are specifically built with a flex-fuel engine optimized to operate also with pure gasoline (E0), the Renault Clio Hi-Flex and the Fiat Siena Tetrafuel.|$|E
5|$|When Rovio {{began writing}} new {{versions}} of the game for other devices, new issues came to light. As the team began working on a version for Android systems, they observed {{the large number of}} configurations of device types and {{versions of the}} Android software. The number of combinations of software version, processor speed and even user interfaces was significantly larger than that for the iOS version. Ultimately, the team settled on a minimum set of requirements, even though that left nearly 30 types of Android phones <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> the game, including some newly released phones. It was released on October 15, 2010. One month after the initial release on Android, Rovio Mobile began designing a lite version of the game for these other devices.|$|E

50|$|Allyson Felix {{is known}} as a 200 metres specialist, but two years earlier her string of 200 meter championships was snapped along with her {{hamstring}} in the final. Based on winning the 2014 Diamond League, Felix was qualified to enter the 200 metres here but chose to forego that opportunity to put all her eggs in this basket. Perhaps she was enticed by her narrow loss in this event four years earlier. With world leader Francena McCorory <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> qualify <b>to</b> <b>run</b> here at the American Championships, Felix was the name to beat. The defending champion Christine Ohuruogu, known for her late rush, also made the final.|$|R
5|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2015 season, three practice sessions were held, two 1.5-hour sessions on Friday and another one-hour session before qualifying on Saturday. Kimi Räikkönen and Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari were quickest {{in the first}} free practice session on Friday afternoon, with Räikkönen the only driver to lap the course in less than 1:38. The Mercedes team focused on long runs, running their cars on high fuel loads to examine tyre wear and were therefore down in 15th and 16th places respectively. Vettel's Ferrari showed problems early in the session, but Vettel was able to run without issues towards the end. Jenson Button spun out in turn one on {{the start of his}} first flying lap and was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> again as his team tried to change his car's battery. It was however an uplifting session for McLaren nonetheless, since Button's teammate Fernando Alonso finished in seventh place, just seven-tenths away from Räikkönen's fastest time. After China the week before, Jolyon Palmer once again took part in the first practice session for Lotus.|$|E
5|$|Ruffing {{dropped out}} of school as a child to work in a coal mine in his native Illinois. He played for the mine's company {{baseball}} team as an outfielder and first baseman. After he lost four toes from his left foot in a mining accident, he became <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> in the field, and switched to pitching. He played in minor league baseball in 1923 and 1924 before making his MLB debut with the Red Sox. After struggling with Boston, pitching to a 36–93 win–loss record, the Red Sox traded Ruffing to the Yankees, where he became successful, pitching as the Yankees' ace through 1946. After one season with the White Sox, Ruffing retired from pitching to work in coaching. He served as a bullpen coach for the White Sox, a pitching coach for the New York Mets, and a scout and minor league instructor for the Cleveland Indians.|$|E
5|$|The goal of Lost Coast was to {{demonstrate}} the new high-dynamic-range rendering implemented into the Source game engine. Valve first attempted to implement high-dynamic-range rendering in Source in late 2003. The first method stored textures in RGBA color space, allowing for multisample anti-aliasing and pixel shaders to be used, but this prevented alpha mapping and fog effects from working properly, as well as making textures appear sharp and jagged. The second method involved saving two versions of a texture: one with regular data, {{and the other with}} overbrightening data. However, this technique did not allow for multisample anti-aliasing and consumed twice as much video card memory, making it infeasible. The third method, shown at the E3 convention in 2005, used floating point data to define the RGB color space, allowing for reasonably efficient storage of the high-dynamic-range data. However, this method also did not allow for multisample anti-aliasing, and was only compatible with Nvidia video cards, leaving ATI cards <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> high dynamic range. The fourth and final method compromised between the second and third methods, using overbrightening textures sparingly and allowing ATI cards to render HDR in a different way to the Nvidia ones while nearly producing the same end result.|$|E

Iowa's inability <b>to</b> establish a <b>run</b> game closed up Iowa's potential for play-action passing, which had been Beathard's bread and butter all season. Iowa's halfbacks, their biggest threat all season, were overall <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> garner any significant yardage on the ground.|$|R
