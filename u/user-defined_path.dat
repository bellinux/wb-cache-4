40|$|A domain-specific {{crossover}} with NSGA-II {{algorithm is}} pro-posed for generating the compliant mechanisms. The new-crossover divides a design-domain into sub-domains and ex-changes {{the areas of}} sub-domains between two-parents of GA population. A single objective analysis of minimizing the weight of structure is performed first and topology is named as reference-design. Thereafter, a bi-objective op-timization problem is formulated with primary and helper objectives of minimizing the weight and maximizing the di-versity of structures with respect to reference-design. The diversity is evaluated by comparing the dissimilarities in bit value at each gene position of binary strings of reference-design and GA evolved structure. Motivation behind the use helper-objective and new-crossover is to generate a diverse set of non-dominated NSGA-II solutions which accomplish a task of tracing a <b>user-defined</b> <b>path.</b> Therefore, both op-timization problems are subjected to constraints of allowed deviation at precision points of a prescribed path with a con-straint on stress, and are solved using a local search based NSGA-II procedure. During the optimization, compliant mechanisms can have any support and loading positions with varying input-displacement magnitude within their respec-tive domains. Obtained results are further compared {{with the results of}} another-crossover operator based study which was used to generate compliant mechanisms...|$|E
30|$|SPC {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{novelties}} in Hidost with respect to SL 2013; therefore, an evaluation of its effects on the performance of the system is only fitting. Figure 15 demonstrates that SPC does not affect detection performance, neither positively nor negatively. Results of SL 2013 (no SPC) are virtually identical on PDF to those of Hidost (with SPC) when the same Random Forest classifier is utilized. Effects on SWF are negligible because its rigid logical structure disallows <b>user-defined</b> <b>paths,</b> resulting in minimal necessity for SPC.|$|R
40|$|A {{case study}} on the {{analysis}} of evacuation travel paths in virtual reality (VR) tunnel fire experiments is presented to increase the understanding on evacuation behaviour. A novel method based {{on the study of}} the parametric equations of the occupants’ evacuation travel paths using vector operators inspired by functional analysis theory and the new concept of interaction areas (IAs) is introduced. IAs are presented and calculated in order to represent the distance of an occupant from a reference point (e. g., an emergency exit, the fire source, etc.) over time. The method allows comparisons of travel paths between experimental groups as well as comparisons with reference <b>paths</b> (e. g. <b>user-defined</b> <b>paths,</b> real-world paths, etc.). Results show that a common assumption employed by evacuation models (the use of a hypothetical path based on the shortest distance) may be an over-simplistic approximation of the evacuation paths...|$|R
30|$|Reduced attack surface. Without SPC, every {{distinct}} {{path with}} an occurrence count above a threshold constitutes a feature. An attacker striving to evade detection may {{in that case}} perform a hiding attack by concealing a malicious payload at a custom path different from any in the feature set. For example, a path to a font with a long, randomly generated name is highly unlikely to have been encountered before. A malicious payload inserted there would invisible to the detector {{that does not have}} this particular path in its feature set. In case of SWF, where <b>user-defined</b> <b>paths</b> are disallowed, payloads may be concealed in very deep hierarchies, not encountered in “normal” files. PDF also suffers from this vulnerability. Hiding attacks are cheap to implement and the primary weakness of SL 2013. This avenue for evasion is closed in Hidost with the use of consolidated paths.|$|R
40|$|The present work aims {{to evolve}} the {{multiple}} topologies of path generating compliant mechanisms. The trade-off so-lution’s based topologies are developed by simultaneously minimization of weight and supplied input energy to elastic structures. The functional aspect of these compliant mech-anisms {{is accomplished by}} imposing the constraints on pre-cision points to generate the <b>user-defined</b> <b>path.</b> These hard constraints are designed with some possibility of violation and are based on one user-defined parameter called allow-able deviation (η). The present constraint bi-objective opti-mization formulation ensures the tracing of prescribed path by all feasible compliant mechanism topologies. The sen-sitivity of the evolved topologies is also investigated in this paper {{which is based on}} different η values. The evolutionary algorithm (NSGA-II) is customized in the present work to ef-ficiently deal with the constraint bi-objective, non-linear and discrete problem of compliant mechanisms. The obtained non-dominated solutions after the termination of NSGA-II algorithm are further refined by a binary-variable based lo-cal search method. Overall, this study is expected to provide a platform to the designers and decision makers to under-stand the topological changes and the flexibility to choose a particular design of compliant mechanism as per their re-quirement from the non-dominated set of solutions. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an ongoing project {{of which the}} purpose is designing and developing techniques and algorithms for autonomous off-road vehicles. The focus is {{on some of the}} components necessary to accomplish autonomous navigation, which involves sensing and moving safely along a <b>user-defined</b> <b>path</b> in a dynamic forest environment. The work is part of a long-term vision in the forest industry of developing an unmanned shuttle that transports timber from the felling area to the main roads for further transportation. A new path-tracking algorithm is introduced and demonstrated as superior to standard algorithms, such as Follow the Carrot and Pure Pursuit. This is accomplished by using recorded data from a path-learning phase. By using the recorded steering angle, the curvature of the path is automatically included in the final steering command. Localization is accomplished by a neural network that fuses data from a Real-Time Kinematic Differential GPS/GLONASS, a gyro, and wheel odometry. Test results are presented for path tracking and localization accuracy from runs conducted on a full-sized forest machine. A large part of the work has been design and implementation of a general software platform for research in autonomous vehicles. The developed algorithms and software have been implemented and tested on a full-size forest machine supplied by our industrial partner Komatsu Forest AB. Results from successful field tests with autonomous path tracking, including obstacle avoidance, are presented...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} evolution of a GIS-based corridor route planning methodology called Analytic Minimum Impedance Surface (AMIS). A local State Highway Agency (SHA) requested an analytic methodology that would facilitate choice of a route corridor for a section of a proposed Interstate highway connector in the southeastern U. S. The SHA’s specification demanded a robust, quantitative methodology that would both provide comparative information about pre-selected corridors and/or aid {{in the selection of}} corridors based on <b>user-defined</b> <b>path</b> inputs or endpoint location specifications. Additionally, the methodology was required to structure and incorporate useful input from a range of stakeholders including SHA employees from various divisions with separate but necessary remits, such as Design and Environmental, and other transportation professionals from the public and private sectors. Figure 1 shows an enlargement of the study area and displays current road connections. The problem domain is located in a complex karst landscape possessing a variety of landforms and geologic characteristics. Much of the study area is dissected by a dense network of streams and steep gradients and cliffs are common.

40|$|HyperSlice is a {{new method}} for the {{visualization}} of scalar functions of many variables. With this method the multi-dimensional function is presented in a simple and easy to understand way in which all dimensions are treated identically. The central concept is the representation of a multi-dimensional function as a matrix of orthogonal two-dimensional slices. These two-dimensional slices lend themselves very well to interaction via direct manipulation, due to a one to one relation between screen space and variable space. Several interaction techniques, for navigation, the location of maxima, {{and the use of}} <b>user-defined</b> <b>paths,</b> are presented. 1 Introduction 1. 1 Problem Scalar functions of several variables are often used in science and engineering.

40|$|Lightness {{constancy}} {{refers to}} the ability to estimate an object's lightness (ie, surface reflectance), regardless of variations in the light being reflected from the object—for example, when the illumination changes or the object moves. Buckley et al (1994) observed that binocular cues improve lightness constancy. Here we explored how training improved lightness constancy under binocular, bi-ocular (identical images to each eye), and monocular viewing. Stimuli consisted of a diffusely illuminated Lambertian grey box, containing a single target: a faceted rectangular block that could be presented at a range of depths within the box. Stimuli were presented stereoscopically (to provide full binocular cues), monocularly, and bi-ocularly. In the experiment, participants were asked to select {{one of a number of}} blocks, presented below the box, that was of the same material as the target block. Four groups of participants received differing training regimes. Active training involved moving a block of fixed reflectance within the box along a <b>user-defined</b> <b>path</b> (by pressing keyboard buttons). Passive training was the same as active, except block movements were pre-recorded. One group received both active and passive training. No-training used a static presentation of blocks to indicate depth. We found that stereoscopic presentation produced the best lightness constancy. Training regimes delivered a performance difference for stereoscopic, monocular, and bi-ocular presentations, with passive and active training being equally effective. With some training regimes participants took longer to achieve their best performance...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — A new bi-objective {{optimization}} problem is for-mulated for generating the diverse topologies of compliant mechanisms tracing a <b>user-defined</b> <b>path.</b> Motivation behind {{the present study}} is to generate the compliant mechanisms which perform the same task of tracing a prescribed trajectory near minimum-weight solution. Therefore, the constraint are imposed at each precision point representing a prescribed path for accomplishing the tracing task. An additional constraint on stress is also included for the feasible designs. The study starts with a single objective analysis of minimum-weight of compliant mechanism and the obtained topology is referred as the reference design. Thereafter, a bi-objective {{optimization problem}} is solved by considering the objectives as minimization of weight of structure and maximization of diversity of structure with respect to the reference design. Here, the diversity is evaluated by finding the dissimilarity in the bit value at each gene position of the binary strings of the reference design and a structure evolved from the GA population. A local search based multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) optimization procedure is used in which the NSGA-II is used as a global search and optimization algorithm. A parallel computing is employed in the study for evaluating non-linear geometric FE analysis and also for the NSGA-II operations. After the NSGA-II run, a few solutions are selected from the non-dominated front and the local search is applied on them. With the help of a given optimization procedure, compliant mechanism designs tracing curvilinear and straight line trajectories are evolved and presented in the study. In both examples, compliant mechanisms are designed to have any arbitrary support and loading regions. I...|$|E

40|$|It is {{anticipated}} that the contribution of rotorcraft activities to {{the environmental impact of}} civil aviation will increase in the future. Due to their versatility and robustness, helicopters are often operated in harsh environments with extreme ambient conditions. These severe conditions not only affect the performance of the engine but also affect the aerodynamics of the rotorcraft. This impact is reflected in the fuel burn and pollutants emitted by the rotorcraft during a mission. The aim {{of this paper is to}} introduce an exhaustive methodology to quantify the influence adverse environment conditions have in the mission fuel consumption and the associated emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx). An emergency medical service (EMS) and a search and rescue (SAR) mission are used as case studies to simulate the effects of extreme temperatures, high altitude, and compressor degradation on a representative twin-engine medium (TEM) weight helicopter, the Sikorsky UH- 60 A Black Hawk. A simulation tool for helicopter mission performance analysis developed and validated at Cranfield University was employed. This software comprises different modules that enable the analysis of helicopter flight dynamics, powerplant performance, and exhaust emissions over a <b>user-defined</b> flight <b>path</b> profile. For the validation of the models implemented, extensive comparisons with experimental data are presented throughout for rotorcraft and engine performance as well as NOx emissions. Reductions as high as 12 % and 40 % in mission fuel and NOx emissions, respectively, were observed for the “high and cold” scenario simulated at the SAR role relative to the same mission trajectory under standard conditions...|$|R
30|$|In {{this work}} we {{presented}} a fully automatic, fast and feature-oriented 3 D alignment pipeline for high-quality object modeling from an unchained acquisition of dense range scans. The proposed approach takes as input {{a set of}} range images ordered according to a suitable <b>user-defined</b> acquisition <b>path,</b> then (1) extracts a set of feature points; (2) describes them through information extrapolated from the local surface; (3) matches the set {{with respect to the}} database of feature points associated to any previously aligned range image; (4) identifies the reliable matches and (5) tries to compute a roto-translation matrix out of such correspondences. The multi-view framework allows object alignment under the most reasonable assumption that each new range image must possess an overlap with respect to any other previously aligned range data, thus weakening the requirement of having an overlap between each sequential pair of range images. Several comparisons have been performed to evaluate the performances of each block of the pipeline we introduced with respect to competitor solutions, for a variety of different use scenarios. The pipeline performance has been evaluated on a group of 14 datasets, for a total of 300 highly resoluted range scans. Obtained results show a high degree of robustness and reliability of the technique, and are relevant in terms of improving the usability and the handiness of modern 3 D scanners by allowing interactive (on-the-fly) object alignment and therefore fast modeling. In few cases clusters of correctly aligned views appeared, mostly due to possible inter-object feature similarities. However, the detection of this kind of problem can be rendered automatic or semi-automatic and deferred at an implementation level according to specific application requirements. A major issue that we observed is the increased amount of computational time due to the matching with a database of features. Solutions can be devised by using feature space organization approaches. However, this usually does not impair an interactive usage of the scanner, except for very big datasets. In conclusion, for the greatest part of the considered real life datasets, the proposed method guarantees competitive performance for a robust, fast, accurate and automated object alignment, consequently boosting the usability of high-end 3 D scanners.|$|R
40|$|After some {{introductory}} remarks upon the Advanced Local Energy Planning issues, methodologies and tools developed in last years, {{the integration of}} the space variable into the analysis approach performed with some models of the MARKAL-TIMES family is discussed. Some recent applications performed by the LAME Team are discussed, where a high regionalization of the RES (MATISSE) or new spatial descriptions of the energy trade routes (REACCESS) have been performed. For a local energy planning, where a defined metropolitan area and one of its districts is involved, it is useful to develop specific GIS-integrated modelling tools able to identify (and locate) and to characterize a suitable mix of measures / intervention / technologies and infrastructures {{in the direction of a}} "smart" and sustainable society, for exploring significant mid- and long-term scenarios. The LEP-CN (Local Energy Planning for China) Model, derived from the EDPM-CN (Energy Demand Projection Model) developed in the framework of an EU-CHINA 5 -Year program (EC 2), is presented. This Model is able to assess, in a mid-long term time horizon, the energy consumptions by end-use sector on an urban district scale, by means of a simulation approach and of a geo-referenced characterization of all the buildings in the analyzed area. Construction data related to the building (Floor Area, Number of floors, Volume, Form Factor, Construction Period, Reference Building Type, and so on) and main energy related indicators (per capita Floor Area, number of persons in a single Household, per capita Income, and so on are taken into account. The main technologies adopted by each building for the fulfilment of each Service Demand (Space Heating, Space Cooling, Water Heating, Cooking, Lighting) and the number of electrical appliances (TV, Refrigerators, Washing Machines, Dish Washers, PC, and so on) for each building are also considered. The state of the connections to the district heating and to the natural and city gas networks and the identification of the connecting nodes and parameters describing the "load" of the connection (from a technical/economic point of view) are included. Furthermore, starting from the space heating demand of each building and from the geo-referenced representation of the urban networks, LEP-CN can perform, through an embedded procedure, an analysis on the district heating system; in absence of a local network, it is possible to find (under suitable <b>user-defined</b> constraints) the <b>path</b> that minimizes the total cost and reproduce it in a graphical form on map. Due to the lack of information on suitable Chinese building classifications and considering the limited availability of official and available data, up to twelve reference Building Units have been identified, related to the building dimensions (high rise, medium rise, low rise) and to the construction period, which incorporates the main energy related features. For the purpose of testing the LEP-CN approach an urban zone in Beijing has been identified, where there are low rise buildings belonging to urban villages (Hutong) as well as medium and high rise buildings. The LEP-CN approach resulted suitable for a significant set of urban energy planning exercise...|$|R
