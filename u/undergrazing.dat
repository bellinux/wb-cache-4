40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the changes to}} calcareous grassland plots within protected sites, and whether Tephroseris integrifolia subsp. integrifolia {{can act as a}} useful indicator species for re-visitation studies within vegetation predicted to remain relatively stable. Twenty-two plots located across lowland England and all formerly containing T. integrifolia were re-surveyed following the methodology used in the original survey undertaken in the 1960 s. Pseudo-turnover and between-observer bias were minimised by sampling replicate quadrats at each fixed plot using a single surveyor and at a similar time of year as the original survey. Qualitative details concerning grazing management were obtained for all sites. In contrast to other long-term re-visitation studies, all our study plots were intact and retained diverse, herb-rich vegetation, demonstrating the value of site protection. However, there were clear shifts in vegetation composition, most notably where T. integrifolia was absent, as shown by an increase in Ellenberg fertility and moisture signifying nutrient enrichment, and a decrease in the cover of low-growing, light-demanding specialists, with a change likely to be associated predominantly with grazing management. Whereas in the mid- 20 th century the greatest threat to calcareous grassland was habitat loss, <b>undergrazing</b> or temporary neglect now appears to pose the principal threat. Distinctive species such as T. integrifolia with marked sensitivity to habitat change provide a potentially useful tool for rapid assessment and monitoring of site quality. Focusing monitoring on such species allows non-expert observers to recognise the early stages of habitat degradation, providing, in effect, a “health check” on individual sites and groups of sites...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{documents}} community metabolism on four reef flats at La Reunion Island: (1) two undisturbed reef flats, (2) a reef flat {{damaged by}} the combined effects of nutrient loading and <b>undergrazing</b> (Planch’Alizés), and (3) a reef flat destroyed in 1989 by a hurricane (La Varangue). The undisturbed sites display similar excess productions (E), slightly positive in summer (56 - 59 μM O 2 m- 2 d- 1, gross primary production to respiration ratio (Pg/R) = 1. 11 - 1. 13), and nil in winter. Whatever the season, E is positive at La Varangue (177 - 325 μM O 2 m- 2 d- 1; Pg/R = 1. 18 - 1. 22); data suggest a tendency towards net heterotrophy at Planch’Alizés (E between - 125 and - 71 μM O 2 m- 2 d- 1; Pg /R = 0. 87 - 1); E is higher at La Varangue, and the Pg /R ratio lower at Planch’Alizés, than at the other sites. In winter, Planch’Alizés displays a lower daily net calcification than the other sites (18 and 110 - 182 μM CaCO 3 m- 2 d- 1 respectively); in summer, a significant CaCO 3 dissolution occurs at night at this site (respectively - 16 and 3 to 5 μM CaCO 3 m- 2 h- 1). Therefore, calcification and/or net productivity allow the characterization of the disturbed areas. At Saint-Leu, they reflect the shift in community structure, which occurred after the hurricane. The dominance of massive corals may affect the carbonate budget at Planch’Alizés. However, the negative E values and the night-time CaCO 3 dissolution observed in summer at this site presumably result from an input of exogenous organic matter, and, therefore, mainly reflect anthropogenic disturbance...|$|E
40|$|During {{the period}} of 1937 to 1940 the Department of Agronomy of Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station in {{cooperation}} with the Valentine sub-station conducted pasture studies in Cherry County, Nebraska. The purposes of these studies are: (1) to present an analysis of vegetation in tall and short grass rangelands; (2) to observe the activities of cattle on the range and (3) to study the effect of grazing upon vegetation. These studies consisted of several projects on both sandhill (tall-grass post climax) and hardland (short-grass disclimax) pastures. These two very different types of grassland afford an excellent opportunity for the comparisons of tall and short grass range. Both areas were grazed by high-grade, beef type cattle. There is great diversity in the vegetation in the sandhills, but the hardland region had very uniform vegetation. Neither the rate of stocking nor the type of forage produced had any great effect upon the total hours of grazing or resting; but the cattle grazing on the hardlands (irrespective of rate of stocking) grazed and rested for shorter periods than those herds in the sandhills. Thus the length of the grazing and resting cycles, seems to be effected by the difference in the type of forage upon which cattle are grazing. Probably the most serious factor in the deterioration of the sandhill ranges is the improper distribution of grazing animals over the range area, resulting in extreme overgrazing on parts of the range and <b>undergrazing</b> on other parts. This is also a serious problem in the hardland pastures. The final aim in range research should be to discover means of securing the essential facts for a better range management program. Advisor: A.

40|$|Poor grazing {{distribution}} {{is a major}} problem on rangelands of the western United States. Grazing animals tend to congregate in areas near water, shade, and level terrain. These areas typically become overgrazed, while less preferred areas of pasture remain <b>undergrazed.</b> Solutions to localized overgrazing include cross-fencing and water development; however, most land managers are unwilling to bear the expense associated with these strategies. Most types of supplements, including mineral supplements, have potential to lure cattle into under-utilized areas of range and pasture.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the number oftillers with different levels of defoliation and theircharacteristics on the Brachiaria decumbens cv. Basilisk pasture. Three different areas on the pasture (<b>undergrazed,</b> with proper grazing and overgrazed) and three tiller categories (without defoliation, withdefoliation and without shoot apical meristem) were evaluated. Randomized block design with three repetitions was used. The B. decumbens pasture was managed under the continuous stocking system with cattle, and the grass height was kept at about 25 cm. Thenumber of tillers showing defoliation was higher (1, 333 tillers/m²) for the overgrazed area compared to the area with proper grazing and the <b>undergrazed</b> area. Inverse response pattern was observed for the tillers without defoliation. On the other hand, the number of tillerswithout the shoot apical meristem was higher in the areas with proper grazing (395 tillers/m²). Tillers without defoliation showed a lower pseudoculm length (10. 3 cm) and a smaller number of dead leaves (0. 22) when compared to the other categories. The length of the leafblade did not change for the tiller categories evaluated. The number of grazed leaves was lower for tillers without the shoot apical meristem in relation to the ones showing or not defoliation. Lower leaf area for the tillers that had the shoot apical meristem removed was observed. Tillers without the shoot apical meristem showed a lowerpercentage of green leaf blade (GLB), higher percentages of both live culm (LC) and dead leaf blade (DLB) as well as a lower relation of the GLB/LC and weight comparing to the tillers showing or not defoliation. Those last ones did not differ regarding their morphological composition.

40|$|European {{semi-natural}} calcareous grasslands are species-rich ecosystems, {{considered as}} priority habitats by the European Union (92 / 43 /EEC Directive) and judged worthy of conservation. They are in strong decline in extension and {{are threatened by}} abandonment throughout Europe. It is known that grasslands management (grazing, mowing) acts as driving force in plant community diversity, {{which in turn is}} an important conservation aim of European environmental policies. The area of current pastoral landscape (about 1000 ha) of the North Adriatic (Æiæarija, Croatia) was studied in order: 1 / to understand which factors drive floristic differentiation – environmental features and/or grassland management conditions, 2 / to identify indicator species sets linked to those factors and 3 / to appraise the effects of management type on the coenological and functional composition of indicator species. 73 phytosociological relevés were carried out; for each of them field data (altitude, aspect, slope and land form), productivity measurements and information on grassland management were collected. Redundancy analysis (RDA) identified a productivity-related soil moisture gradient as the environmental driving force of grassland floristic differentiation. Indicator species analysis (ISA) detected the indicator species sets related to environmental features and management type. The results indicate that <b>undergrazing</b> and the lack of periodic mowing are responsible for the higher total variance of floristic data set explained by environmental parameters rather than by management (use/not use). For the same reasons, the variations that emerged from comparison of the functional characteristics of the indicator species of grazing and of mowing (avoidance strategy, life form, and storage organs) proved more important than those observed in comparing used and abandoned grasslands. The management system adopted (grazing or mowing) appears in turn to be conditioned by the soil moisture/productivity gradient...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{evaluate}} the feasibility and constraints of organic farming to increase the sustainability of Mediterranean small ruminant livestock systems. The paper analyzes the factors affecting sustainability of small ruminant livestock systems in the Mediterranean basin, such as seasonal forage availability or suboptimal pasture utilisation due to overgrazing but also the factor of <b>undergrazing.</b> The paper considers how the application of practices of organic farming may contribute to promoting sustainable land use and improving environment conservation, animal welfare, and product quality. Also the prospects of new information-based technologies, like geographic information systems and global positioning systems, to improve sustainability are presented. A model of pasture-based dairy sheep production system is proposed, with special emphasis on the organisation of a farm forage system to meet animal nutritional requirement. Some options for an integrated strategy for the control of parasitic disease in small ruminant production systems are discussed. These {{are based on a}} combination of general prevention methods (i. e. risk control and identification), grazing management (i. e. multifunctional grassland management), nonchemical treatments (i. e. homeopathic herbal preparations) and novel approaches (i. e. biological control and bioactive forages). Comparative effects of phytotherapy and conventional treatment on dairy sheep helminthic disease and on metabolic status and animal welfare are presented. The prospects of organic farming are of particular interest for the less favoured Mediterranean areas, where it may contribute to the safeguard of agricultural functions, like care and preservation of landscape, and safeguarding of rural villages with positive effects on {{the quality of life in}} rural communities. Some activities would be particularly appropriate in natural parks, where small ruminants and other domestic animals interact with wildlife and where biodiversity must be preserved. For positive results a new collaborative decision-making process is required between rural and urban communities, businesses and government. In addition, strong supports from scientific research and the extension services are needed to correct and fully utilize new information technologies to exploit the magnitude and potential of organic farming for enhancement of sustainable small ruminant production systems in the Mediterranean region.

40|$|Summary and Implications •Cows {{outdoors}} from mid February {{to early}} April offered an 80 : 20 grazed grass concentrate diet produced similar milk yield with higher protein yield and content compared to cows offered a 40 : 60 grass silage concentrate diet. •The improvement in animal performance {{is attributed to}} a higher energy, protein and total DM intake. •In the carryover period when both groups were grazing fulltime, the cows with early turnout had higher milk protein concentrations and higher grass DM intakes (1 kg DM/cow/day) •An early grazed sward had a similar grass growth potential as a late grazed sward. •Herbage from early grazed swards have higher grass digestibility (OMD and UFL) value than late grazed swards •A lower daily herbage allowance can be tolerated with early grazed swards to achieve similar milk production performance as from late grazed swards. Up to 5 - 6 kg grass DM of late grazed swards will achieve {{the same level of}} milk production from early grazed swards. •With late turnout allocating high daily herbage allowance with large pre -grazing herbage mass is wasteful and compounds the effects of poor grass utilisation and <b>undergrazing.</b> •Early grazing is recommended when conditions allow even on heavy soil types. •From mid April onwards the optimum-stocking rate on early grazed swards is between 4. 0 - 4. 5 cows/ha. At this stocking rate a balance is found between feeding the cow adequately at pasture and achieving the correct post - grazing residuals. •Grass dry matter intake was significantly higher for the early grazed medium stocked cows in both studies, which clearly shows that the improvements in sward quality with early grazed swards can be converted to higher dairy cow performance. •Cows grazing the early grazed sward at a medium stocking rate had higher milk production performance which persisted in subsequent grazing rotations. This was due to the higher quality herbage available with the lower herbage mass swards. •When modelled to the whole farm system the reduced feed cost and higher performance achieved with early grazing, resulted in each extra day at grass increasing cow profitability by € 2. 70 cow/dayEnd of Project Repor...|$|E

40|$|Floristic and {{vegetation}} studies {{were conducted in}} an experimental area of the Italian Karst at Basovizza/Bazovica included in the Natura 2000 site “Carso Triestino e Goriziano” to assess {{the effects of the}} reintroduction of grazing on plant species and communities. In the area, partially deforested in 2006, cattle, sheep and goats were introduced in the summer of 2007. A monitoring programme for plant populations was performed focusing on four target species typical of the karst dry grasslands: Rock Knapweed Centaurea rupestris, Green-winged Orchid Orchis morio, Toothed Orchid Orchis tridentata and Mountain Pasqueflower Pulsatilla montana. Three exotic invasive species, detrimental to grazing, were also included: Tree of Heaven Ailanthus altissima, Narrow-leaved Ragwort Senecio inaequidens and Common Ragweed Ambrosia artemisiifolia. For each species, the GPS position was taken both for individuals and large groups of plants; a count of the individuals present at each measured point was performed too. In order to verify the process of re-colonization by species of calcareous dry grasslands, phytosociological relevés were carried out in areas previously occupied by Black Pine (Pinus nigra) plantations, woods with Downy Oak (Quercus pubescens) and Hop Hornbeam (Ostrya carpinifolia) and thermophilous scrub of Common Juniper (Juniperus communis), documented from vegetation maps made in 2005. For each vegetation type 6 permanent plots were selected, in which phytosociological relevés were carried out to. The study shows that in the areas of the original karst dry grassland more widely distributed species typical of the habitat remain. In overgrazed areas the grassy turf is discontinuous, segetal terophytic species of the class Stellarietea mediae entering into the gaps. Cover of the Musk Thistle (Carduus nutans) has increased significantly, as spiny species are not palatable to animals. The occasional presence of neophytes such as Daisy Fleabane (Erigeron annuus) and Canadian Horseweed (Conyza canadensis) was also found. In <b>undergrazed</b> areas, however, the natural processes of succession and scrubbing over are taking place. In the areas formerly occupied by pine plantations and woods with Quercus pubescens and Ostrya carpinifolia, Autumn Moor Grass (Sesleria autumnalis) and Rock Tor-grass (Brachypodium rupestre) are still able to become covered by a compact herbaceous sward. An abundant presence of Carduus nutans and the entry of Senecio inaequidens, the latter especially abundant on wood chips derived from tree clearing, were encountered as well as the spread of Ailanthus altissima favoured by the opening up of the scrubland...|$|R
40|$|A {{trial to}} measure the effects of {{establishment}} techniques and fertiliser application on seedling establishment and early root and rhizome development of Caucasian clover (Trifolium ambiguum) was sown in early October 1992, on a low-fertility, depleted, short tussock grassland site at Mesopotamia Station, South Canterbury. Three sowing techniques, broadcasting, sod seeding and strip seeding, each with two rates of fertiliser, 150 or 300 kg/ha molybdic sulphur superphosphate (8 % P, 20 % S), were used. By mid December, 48 % and 38 % establishment had occurred in the strip and sod seeding treatments respectively, but only 10 % in the broadcast. Strip seeding resulted in the earliest taproot and rhizome development of Caucasian clover and the greatest lateral spread of rhizomes. However, all plants strip and sod seeding developed rhizomes after nine months. Plants established by broadcasting were small with few rhizomes in the first season. The higher fertiliser rate improved establishment and growth, particularly in the strip seeding treatment. Strip seeded Caucasian clover established as rapidly as white clover and plants were similar in size after five months. However, Caucasian clover had a larger underground mass {{which could lead to}} greater persistence. A grazing trial was established to observe how two cultivars of Caucasian clover and two seed lines of zig zag clover responded to four diverse grazing treatments. The experiment was located at Lincoln University, latitude 43 º 39 S and longitude 172 º 28 E on a medium to free-draining soil of medium fertility with an annual rainfall of 651 mm. In March 1989 a seed production experiment was established and consisted of Caucasian clover cultivars Alpine and Monaro and zig zag clover seed lines Porters Pass and Kentucky. In spring of 1992 high endophyte ryegrass was direct drilled into this experiment. The first grazing to establish main plot treatments occurred in early October 1993. The experiment design was a randomised block design with two replicates of four treatments. The treatments included two grazing frequencies; rotational grazing and set stocking; and two grazing intensities; hard and lax. Point analysis was used {{to measure the}} botanical composition of the pastures. Only the hexaploid Monaro Caucasian clover was agronomically suitable as a companion for high endophyte ryegrass and white clover under the range of grazing managements. The zig zag clovers showed a classic hay type species inability to persist and contribute to dry matter production under grazing. The diploid Alpine Caucasian clover persisted <b>undergrazing</b> but had a low cover percentage. Monaro Caucasian clover had a mean seasonal cover of between 14 % and 21 % in the grazing treatments, contributing more to pasture cover in the rotationally grazed treatments.
