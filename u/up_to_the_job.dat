5|$|In an {{interview}} held in 2013, Galván said that Nuevo Laredo, {{aside from the}} violence generated by organized crime, was plagued with extortions, armed robberies, car hijackings, and regular thefts. He recognized that restoring public safety was possible, but reiterated {{that it was a}} difficult and long process for all branches of the government. Among the solutions he proposed was the reconstruction of Nuevo Laredo's social fiber, since he believed that that would keep the younger generations and those suffering from poverty away from the lure of organized crime. Galván admitted that the Nuevo Laredo police force was composed entirely of members of the Mexican Armed Forces, the Federal Police, and Tamaulipas state law enforcement and not by municipal police officers, who had all been suspended for investigation and training. However, he said that the military had a role to play, but that he wanted to see civilian forces step <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> in the future.|$|E
25|$|The Government, led by Prime Minister Frederick C. Alderdice, {{called upon}} the British {{government}} to take direct control until Newfoundland could become self-sustaining. The United Kingdom, concerned over Newfoundland's likelihood of defaulting on its loans, asked the government to establish the Newfoundland Royal Commission, headed by a Scottish peer, Lord Amulree. Its report, released in 1933, assessed Newfoundland's political system as institutionally corrupt and its economic future as bleak, recommending the abolition of responsible government, and its replacement by a Commission of the British Government. Acting on the report's recommendations, Alderdice's government voted itself out of existence in December 1933. Appointed as Chair of the Commission of Government in 1934, Anderson found his role as Governor with significantly expanded powers and proved himself <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>job,</b> constantly sending reports back to the Dominions Office and giving advice to the Dominions Secretary {{on how to deal}} with the Commission members.|$|E
25|$|But {{soon the}} Dutch would have {{occasion}} {{to come to}} the aid of the Danes in a conflict with Sweden. In 1654 Charles X Gustav of Sweden ascended the Swedish throne and he embarked on an aggressive policy, in the process harming Dutch interests in several ways. He blockaded the port of Danzig during the Polish part of the Northern Wars, hindering Dutch commerce. In July, 1656 Cornelis de Graeff sent a fleet under Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam of the new Dutch navy. The fleet was dispatched to Danzig which helped persuade the Swedes to lift this blockade. Obdam was the commander-in-chief of the Dutch navy in these years, a political appointment by De Witt, who preferred an officer of the right political color to be in charge, in preference to more competent, but politically undesirable Orangists, when Witte Corneliszoon de With and Michiel de Ruyter (both States-Party men) were unavailable for different reasons. As Obdam was basically a landlubber, this was not an ideal solution, but in this context he proved <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b>|$|E

[...] Older audiences, however, gradually checked {{out of the program}} night by night; seven episodes later, the Late Show with David Letterman had edged above O'Brien for the first time. While Zucker called O'Brien to reiterate that the generational change was expected, other executives were not as pleased. O'Brien and his team were not happy with the lack of promotion in the show's early weeks. Against the wishes of several PR executives, Zucker authorized a press release claiming O'Brien [...] "the New King of Late Night", a move that attracted ridicule. Zucker later regretted the decision, and many at O'Brien's Tonight Show offices were displeased.|$|E

There is no plan, winks Mr. Dawkins, nor any divinity. There is just the 'magic' of the universe unfolding.

2500|$|Haig sent {{copies of}} the {{relevant}} orders and a critique of GHQ's conduct of the battle to his wife, who showed them to Stamfordham (10 November) for the King to see. Robertson was working against French, telling Haig (15 November) that [...] "the first thing is to get you in command". The Prime Minister discussed the matter with the King and Kitchener (both of whom thought French not <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>job,</b> although Kitchener thought the time not right for a change), and, on 23 November, Haig. Asquith then asked Esher to convey to French in person the news that he must resign, {{but that he was}} being offered a peerage and the newly created job of Commander-in-Chief Home Forces. [...] However, French insisted on seeing Asquith again (29 November) at which meeting Asquith told him that he must take the first step and that he was not being [...] "recalled" [...] (sacked). [...] French's official critique of Haig's performance at Loos finally reached the War Office on 1 December. [...] He wrote to Asquith (2 December) suggesting that Kitchener be removed {{to be replaced by a}} civilian Secretary of State to avoid friction with the new job of Commander-in-Chief Home Forces, and writing that he would await Asquith's decision on this point. [...] He returned to France (3 December), but Asquith had been exchanging further letters with Stamfordham and they agreed that French must now be pressed to quit.

Look here, the poor devil is really in want of employment. I won’t ask you much this time: only to hold your tongue; and I shall try to get your brother to take him as chief officer. At this George lays his arms and his head on his desk, so that Cloete feels sorry for him. But altogether Cloete feels more cheerful because he has shaken the ghost a bit into that Stafford.
