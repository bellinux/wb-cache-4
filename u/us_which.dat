5|$|Ayers Rock's {{treatment}} by Australian radio stations during the 1970s {{was related to}} the popularity of AM. Unlike the <b>US,</b> <b>which</b> had a vibrant FM radio scene, in 1976 Australia only had ABC FM and a few community FM stations which primarily played classical music. Commercial AM stations, playing pop and rock music, dominated the local airwaves. The group established their reputation with live performances, exposure in print media, and word of mouth, with minimal Australian radio promotion.|$|E

5|$|Manning {{also worked}} for the BBC; she wrote scripts for {{including}} adaptations of novels by George Eliot, Arnold Bennett and Ada Leverson. She completed her book on Stanley and Emin Pasha, titled The Remarkable Expedition in the UK and The Reluctant Rescue in the <b>US,</b> <b>which</b> was published in 1947, and subsequently reissued in 1985. The book received generally good reviews, but remains comparatively unknown. In 1948, her book of short stories, Growing Up, was published by Heinemann, with the title story a fictionalised account of her affair with Hamish Miles. Manning was to remain with the publisher until 1974.|$|E

5|$|Abu Nuwar's enmity with Glubb Pasha, the Arab Legion's {{powerful}} British {{chief of}} staff, his insistence on establishing Arab command over {{the army and}} his influence with Hussein led the latter to dismiss Glubb Pasha and appoint Abu Nuwar in his place. However, Abu Nuwar's ardent support for the pan-Arabist policies of Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser contributed to Jordan's increasing isolation from the UK and the <b>US,</b> <b>which</b> were major sources of foreign aid to Jordan. At the same time, existing dissatisfaction with Abu Nuwar's leadership by palace officials and veteran Bedouin army units culminated into violent confrontations at the large army barracks in Zarqa between royalist and Arab nationalist units. Two principal accounts emerged regarding the events at Zarqa, with the royalist version holding that the incident was an abortive coup by Abu Nuwar against Hussein, and the dissident version asserting {{that it was a}} staged, American-backed counter-coup by Hussein against the pan-Arabist movement in Jordan. In any case, Abu Nuwar resigned and was allowed to leave Jordan for Syria. He was subsequently sentenced to 15 years in absentia.|$|E
5|$|Before publication, 1.4million {{advanced}} {{orders were}} placed for Half-Blood Prince on Amazon.com, breaking the record {{held by the}} previous novel, Order of the Phoenix, with 1.3million. The initial print run for Half-Blood Prince was a record-breaking 10.8million. Within the first 24hours of release, the book sold 9million copies worldwide, 2million in the UK and about 6.9million in the <b>US,</b> <b>which</b> prompted Scholastic to rush an additional 2.7million copies into print. Within the first nine weeks of publication, 11 million copies of the US edition {{were reported to have}} been sold. The US audiobook, read by Jim Dale, set sales records with 165,000 sold over two days, besting the adaptation of Order of the Phoenix by twenty percent.|$|E
5|$|Following the Spanish–American War in 1898, this {{aggressive}} interpretation {{was used}} to create a U.S. economic empire across the Caribbean, such as with the 1903 treaty with Cuba that was heavily tilted in the U.S.' favor. U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt believed that the U.S. should be the main beneficiary of production in Central America. The U.S. enforced this hegemony with armed interventions in Nicaragua (1912–33), and Haiti (1915–34). The U.S. did not need to use its military might in Guatemala, where a series of dictators were willing to accommodate the economic interests of the U.S. in return for its support for their regimes. Guatemala was among the Central American countries of the period known as a banana republic. From 1890 to 1920, control of Guatemala's resources and its economy shifted away from Britain and Germany to the <b>U.S.,</b> <b>which</b> became Guatemala's dominant trade partner. The Monroe Doctrine continued to be seen as relevant to Guatemala, and {{was used to}} justify the coup in 1954.|$|E

5|$|In 1934 Wodehouse {{moved to}} France for tax reasons; in 1940 {{he was taken}} {{prisoner}} at Le Touquet by the invading Germans and interned for nearly a year. After his release he made six broadcasts from German radio in Berlin to the <b>US,</b> <b>which</b> had not yet entered the war. The talks were comic and apolitical, but his broadcasting over enemy radio prompted anger and strident controversy in Britain, and a threat of prosecution. Wodehouse never returned to England. From 1947 until his death {{he lived in the}} US, taking dual British-American citizenship in 1955. He was a prolific writer throughout his life, publishing more than ninety books, forty plays, two hundred short stories and other writings between 1902 and 1974. He died in 1975, at the age of 93, in Southampton, New York.|$|E
5|$|In North America, a Canadian {{study of}} 27,749 {{children}} in Quebec showed that thiomersal {{was unrelated to}} the increasing trend in pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs). In fact, the study noted that rates of PDDs {{were higher in the}} birth cohorts with no thiomersal when compared to those with medium or high levels of exposure. A study performed in the <b>US</b> <b>which</b> analyzed data from 78,829 children enrolled in HMOs taken from the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) did not show any consistent association between TCVs and neurodevelopmental outcomes, noting different results from data in different HMOs. A study performed in California found that removal of thiomersal from vaccines did not decrease the rates of autism, suggesting that thiomersal could not be the primary cause of autism. A study on children from Denmark, Sweden and California likewise argued against TCVs being causally associated with autism.|$|E
5|$|Issues {{specific}} to his South Coast and Cape Cod–based district, such as maritime policy, {{have been a}} major target of Keating's work. In June 2012, he organized the Federal Fishing Advisory Board, a body to research and address fisheries management concerns between lawmakers and industry stakeholders. In 2012 he and his Massachusetts peers successfully pushed the Commerce Department to issue a federal disaster declaration for fisheries in the northeastern <b>U.S.,</b> <b>which</b> would open up the opportunity for financial aid. In the wake of Hurricane Sandy, he proposed to redirect $111 million of relief funding to fisheries throughout the country, although the proposal was not adopted by the House Rules Committee.|$|E

5|$|Milner and British {{official}} Lionel George Curtis {{were the}} architects of the Round Table movement, a network of organizations promoting closer union between Britain and its self-governing colonies. To this end, Curtis founded the Royal Institute of International Affairs in June 1919 and, with his 1938 book The Commonwealth of God, began advocating for the creation of an imperial federation that eventually reannexes the <b>U.S.,</b> <b>which</b> would be presented to Protestant churches as being the work of the Christian God to elicit their support. The Commonwealth of Nations was created in 1949 but it would only be a free association of independent states rather than the powerful imperial federation imagined by Rhodes, Milner and Curtis.|$|E
5|$|On 6 August, Quwatli {{established}} a long-term {{agreement with the}} USSR, entailing a long-term Soviet loan to fund development works in Syria and the Soviet purchase of {{a large portion of}} Syrian agricultural and textile surpluses. US fears that Syria was approaching a communist takeover had prompted an attempted CIA-sponsored coup to replace the Quwatli government with former president Shishakli. However, the coup plot was foiled by the head of Syrian intelligence, Abdel Hamid al-Sarraj, on 12 August and Syria consequently expelled the US military attaché from Damascus. The <b>US,</b> <b>which</b> denied the coup plot, responded by expelling the Syrian ambassador from Washington and recalling its ambassador from Syria.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet media {{frequently}} covered racial discrimination, financial crises, {{and unemployment}} in the United States, which were viewed as failings of the capitalist system that had been erased by communism. Lynchings of African Americans were seen as an embarrassing skeleton in the closet for the <b>US,</b> <b>which</b> the Soviets used {{as a form of}} rhetorical ammunition when reproached for their own economic and social failings. The phrase grew in usage in the 1960s during the Cold War. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the phrase became widespread as a reference to Russian information-warfare tactics. Its use subsequently became widespread in Russia to criticize any form of U.S. policy.|$|E
