She became a waitress in the town of Arboleda, the most important <b>urban</b> <b>nucleus</b> in the region of Somorrostro. There she met Julián Ruiz Gabiña, union activist and founder of Socialist Youth of Somorrostro. They married in late 1915, two years after the birth of their first child. The young couple participated in the general strike of 1917 and Ruiz returned to jail. During this time, Ibárruri spent nights reading the works of Karl Marx and others found in the library of the Socialist Workers' Centre in Somorrostro.|$|E
25|$|Artefacts {{discovered}} {{in the region of}} Chaves identify the earliest settlement of humans dating back to the Paleolithic. Remnants {{discovered in}} Mairos, Pastoria and São Lourenço, those associated with transient proto-historic settlements and castros, show a human presence in the Alto Tâmega dating to the Chalcolithic. The region has seen persistent human settlement since Roman legions conquered and occupied the fertile valley of the Tâmega River, constructing a nascent outpost and taking over the existing castros in the area. The settlement was located at the convergence of three important Roman roads: the Bracara Augusta, Asturica, and Lamecum that crossed the Roman Province of Gallaecia, linking Rome to the region's natural resources. It was a military centre known for its baths, which lasted until the 16th century. This civilization constructed protective walls to protect the local population; spanned the river with the bridge; promoted the baths (with its warm medicinal waters); exploited local mines and alluvial deposits and other natural resources. Its importance led to the <b>urban</b> <b>nucleus</b> being elevated to the status ofmunicipality in 79 AD, during the reign of the first Flavian Caesar, Titus Flavius Caesar Vespasianus Augustus. Its benefactor consequently influenced its toponymy, becoming known as Aquae Flaviae. Artefacts from the area around the Matriz church indicate that Aquae Flaviae's centre was located in this place, in addition to an ancient headstone showing gladiatorial combat.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{central to}} Lisbon, it is {{normally}} identified {{by a different}} <b>urban</b> <b>nucleus.</b> To the south, running contiguous with the Bairro, is Bica, a zone between the Bica and Alecrim Rivers, and the area of Cata-Que-Farás, which developed {{at the same time}} as the Bairro Alto, but was completely transformed by the 1755 earthquake. In the east is the Chiado, Misericórdia, Largo da Trindade and São Pedro de Alcântara. A connection that existed between Bairro Alto and Chiado from the 16th century, was the medieval wall, identifiable by the Calçada do Combro, Rua do Loreto and Rua Garrett, which was the principal exit gate to the west, through the gates of Santa Catarina (whose opening was in the Largo do Chiado). Immediately around this is the Praça Luís de Camões and the Largo do Chiado, and specifically the iconic Church of Nossa Senhora do Loreto and the Café A Brasileira. To the north, at the end ofRua da Misericórdia is the Largo Trindade Coelho, where the Church of São Roque and Lisbon Misericórdia are located. From here it is the beginning of Rua de São Pedro de Alcântara characterized by structures in a Romantic architectural style and extending to the north until Rua D. Pedro V, defined by the iconic garden/lookout of São Pedro de Alcântara. And still, the Ascensor of Glória connects to the Praça dos Restauradores and Avenida da Liberdade. To the west, immediately near the frontier defined by Rua de O Século and the zone delimited to the south by Rua de São Bento and north by Rua da Escola Politécnica are the Garden of the Prince Royal (...) , the Academy of Sciences building, the Church of Santa Catarina, the Convento dos Paulistas (Convent of São Paulo) and Palácio Pombal [...] (Palace of Pombal).|$|E

40|$|Urbanization is a {{key issue}} when {{studying}} scenarios for sustainable development for the Amazonian region. This paper presents the potential of high-resolution imagery, CBERS/HRC in particular, for the spatial structure identification of <b>urban</b> <b>nuclei</b> in the west of Pará, Brazil. CBERS/HRC and CBERS/CCD imageries were first geocoded and then combined using HIS technique. These fusion images were used to map the general intra-urban features by visual interpretation. Intra-urban zones were extracted based on the shape of land features, identifying: intensity of built areas, presence of vectors of development, access, and communitarian structures. Ancillary data and fieldwork information complemented and validated the urban patterns obtained from the image digital processing. A total of 31 <b>urban</b> <b>nuclei</b> were mapped, and grouped in four principal types: structured, recent, established and dependent on connectivity. These types were defined based on their urbanization level and spatial organization obtained from high-resolution imagery, field observation, and the historical evidences. The methodological procedure proposed in this work can be extended to other areas, depending {{on the availability of}} high-resolution images. This urban characterization contributes to understand the structure and organization of the Amazon territory, and it will be useful for further studies to be developed in the context of Projeto Cenários para Amazônia.

Across-the-board increases in energy prices, combined with the on-going process of employment relocation from the central city to the suburban ring of metropolitan areas, could lead to major, and potentially more energy-conserving spatial reorganizations.

40|$|ABSTRACT In {{view of the}} {{adaptive}} ability of mosquitoes and {{their role in the}} transport of infective agents, entomological surveys undertaken in transitional environments are very important for the determination of the risk they represent for Public Health. Among the principal vectors of the infectious agents involved in the occurrence of important arboviruses, such as dengue, for example, are the Culicidae-insects capable of installing themselves in the <b>urban</b> <b>nuclei,</b> which exist within areas containing vestigial forests. This present study conducted a survey of mosquito species by means of traps to catch their larvae installed in five rural areas within the Atlantic Forest domain and containing its vestigial vegetation in the municipality of Santa Bárbara D'Oeste, São Paulo, Brazil. A total of 13, 241 larvae belonging to six mosquito species were collected on 920 occasions (32. 52 % of positive collections). Aedes albopictus (64. 23 %) and Aedes aegypti (32. 75 %) were the most frequent, followed by Culex quinquefasciatus (1. 32 %), Aedes fluviatilis (1. 04 %), Culex Complex Coronator (0. 40 %) and Toxorhynchites theobaldi (0. 22 %). Three areas were analyzed by means of Simpson's diversity index and the spatial analysis showed that the sites with the greatest abundance of Ae. aegypti presented lower diversity values and were associated with more highly consolidated <b>urban</b> <b>nuclei.</b> The vector of dengue, chikungunya and zika has great infesting ability in urban areas, which means that the early implementation of entomological surveillance and control activities in specific areas - such as transitional ones - is highly important...|$|R
