This paper {{analyzes}} the decision method for selecting components of <b>gripping</b> <b>devices</b> for wafer transfer robots {{from the system}} {{point of view and}} thus provides the basis for type selection and design. Analysis is completed through four steps: First, introduce the role of wafer transfer robot and <b>gripping</b> <b>device</b> in IC manufacture system and analyze the fundamental functions that are essential for wafer gripping; Second, analyze wafer <b>gripping</b> <b>device</b> systematically and divide it into six parts which are called basic elements and provide the implementation methods respectively; Third, analyze and summarize specific requirements to wafer <b>gripping</b> <b>device</b> in wafer transfer process; Finally, analyze and compare the relativity between each basic element and the specific requirement, then give the analysis result in the use of a data table. Through the above analysis of this paper, designers of wafer transfer robot can do analysis and comparison to select suitable components for wafer <b>gripping</b> <b>device,</b> thereby shorten the design circle of robots and improve efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Research from Shogan (2007) and Lim (2008) on the {{executive}} branch proposes that the American presidency has adopted an anti-intellectual approach to leadership, such {{that there is a}} concerted rejection of thoughtful political discourse from the president. This has been reflected by {{what appears to be a}} relative decline in both the linguistic and substantive complexity of presidential rhetoric. Shogan’s (2007) work, while focused on examining whether Republicans are more apt to employ anti-intellectual leadership than Democrats, raises an additional topic worthy of empirical examination: the potential relationship between anti-intellectual leadership and <b>unilateral</b> <b>action</b> from the president. If anti-intellectual leadership is a defiant form of leadership that opts to publicly demonstrate the rejection of external expertise, the usage of anti-intellectual rhetoric from the president might be able to predict the usage of <b>unilateral</b> <b>action.</b> On the other hand, anti-intellectual rhetoric might be used as a straightforward and quick means to explain <b>unilateral</b> <b>action,</b> such that change in the level of <b>unilateral</b> <b>action</b> can predict the usage of simplistic rhetoric. Unfortunately, no one has yet to empirically test whether rhetorical simplicity predicts <b>unilateral</b> <b>action,</b> <b>unilateral</b> <b>action</b> predicts rhetorical simplicity, or there is a multi-directional relationship present. This project makes an initial attempt to remedy this gap in the literature. The project contrasts the monthly average simplicity level of the presidential weekly public address with the monthly number of executive orders emanating from {{the executive}} branch, using information spanning between February 1993 and May 2015.

40|$|Can <b>unilateral</b> <b>action</b> be an {{effective}} response to global climate change? Baylor Johnson worries that a focus on <b>unilateral</b> <b>action</b> by individuals will detract from efforts to secure collective agreements to address the problem. Although Johnson and I agree that individuals have some obligation to reduce their personal emissions, we differ in {{the degree to which}} we see personal reductions as effective in spurring broader change. I argue that 'unilateral reductions' can have communicative value and that they can change the structure of collective action problems, making such problems easier to solve. Since collective action problems are much less tractable where individuals abide by the tenets of traditional game theory and much more tractable where individuals are oriented to cooperate and to trust that others will reciprocate, we need moral norms that promote individual restraint in exploitation of the commons, and we ought ourselves to abide by those norms.

40|$|With {{regard to}} global or {{regional}} environmental problems, do nations that take <b>unilateral</b> <b>actions</b> inspire {{other countries to}} curtail emissions?

40|$|Micro {{assembly}} {{is typically}} characterised by positioning tolerances below a few micro meters. In {{the case of}} the assembly of hybrid micro systems, such as optical glass fibres, micro ball lenses or micro probes for measurement tasks, even positioning accuracies in the sub-micrometer range have to be achieved. In case of positioning devices with less than 6 degrees of freedom, flexibility in terms of adaptation to the orientation of the objects is required. The flexibility of existing gripping systems is often reduced by the design of the utilized end effector. In case of mechanical <b>gripping</b> <b>devices,</b> the achievable precision in the field of micro and precision assembly is strongly defined by the shape of the end effector surfaces. Introducing flexibility, combined with precision into that kind of <b>gripping</b> <b>device</b> has {{to be seen as a}} challenge, most important when talking about gripping micro products in different shapes, size and based on different materials. Using vacuum based <b>gripping</b> <b>devices,</b> an appropriate end effector surface design is required to ensure a defined orientation of the manipulated object. In order to combine precision with flexibility, the precisely defined end effector shape has to be replaced by a solution, allowing the gripping of objects like micro parts, small lenses and other small components well defined and same time being able to adapt to object size, shape and orientation. On behalf of this background the Fraunhofer IPT conducts research on a concept to realize a highly flexible, fast and cost-efficient micro assembly based on conventional assembly systems combined with a six axis fine positioning assembly head. In this context, a concept for the design of a miniaturised tri-point vacuum <b>gripping</b> <b>device</b> with integrated positioning and alignment capabilities is presented...|$|R

When countries play a game of timing in a period before emission and adaptation decisions 9 ̆ 6 to determine who takes the role of the Stackelberg leader 9 ̆ 6 it is shown that a country with this specific property indeed becomes the follower.
