50|$|Use cases {{constitute}} a powerful, <b>user-centric</b> {{tool for the}} software requirements specification process.

This user-centered approach ensure that what has the real business value and the user really want is developed, not those trivial functions speculated from a developer or system (inside) perspective.|$|E
