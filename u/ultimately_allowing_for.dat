40|$|Metasurfaces have {{revolutionized}} photonics due {{to their}} ability to shape phase fronts as requested and to tune beam directionality using nanoscale metallic or dielectric scatterers. Here we reveal inverse metasurfaces showing superior properties compared to their positive counterparts if transmission mode operation is considered. The key advantage of such slot-type metasurfaces is the strong reduction of light in the parallel-polarization state, making the crossed-polarization, being essential for metasurface operation, dominant and highly visible. In the experiment, we show an up to four times improvement in polarization extinction for the individual metasurface element geometry consisting of deep subwavelength nanoboomerangs with feature sizes of the order of 100 nm. As confirmed by simulations, strong plasmonic hybridization yields two spectrally separated plasmonic resonances, <b>ultimately</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>for</b> the desired phase and scattering engineering in transmission.

Understanding these processes is difficult due to the complex mechanical environment in vivo. In this research, we have developed several cell-stretching devices capable of subjecting cell cultures to non-uniform stretch distributions in order to investigate pathological responses of vascular smooth muscle cells to physiologic stretches. 10 T 1 / 2 cells were cyclically stretched with these devices for 24 hours upon silicone membranes, PDMS tubes, and within 3 D PEGDA hydrogels. After stretching, altered cell behaviors were measured, including orientation, proliferation (quantified by BrdU incorporation), and gene expression (quantified by real-time, RT-PCR). Cells demonstrated marked changes in orientation, proliferation, and mRNA expression, which all varied with cellular location in the non-uniform environment. More specifically, increased orientation, increased proliferation, and more dramatically altered mRNA expression were found in regions of high, uniaxial stretch, relative to regions of low, near-equibiaxial stretch. These findings demonstrate the capabilities of graded stretch distributions to produce graded cell responses, indicating potentially localized smooth muscle cell behavior in a diseased artery.

40|$|Prevention of {{infectious}} diseases by vaccination is often limited {{because of the lack}} of safe, effective, and accessible vaccines. Traditional vaccines are expensive and require special conditions for storage, distribution, and administration. Plants have potential for large-scale production of a variety of inexpensive and highly effective recombinant proteins for biomedical and pharmaceutical applications, including subunit vaccines. There are several approaches for the production of vaccine antigens in plants, including transient expression systems based on Agrobacterium delivery of binary vectors or plant viral vectors, stable transgenic plants, and plant cell or tissue cultures. Axenic plant cultures maintained under defined physical and chemical conditions appear to be an attractive production platform when target proteins need to be synthesized in a fully controlled environment. Hairy root cultures meet the criteria for such a system. Hairy root cultures, generated from edible plants and producing target antigens, provide a potential approach for the development of vaccines for oral delivery. With this approach, there are no protein extraction and purification costs and the active biomolecule is protected by the plant cell wall during passage through the upper gastrointestinal tract. This allows for gradual release of antigen at mucosal surfaces in the gut.

40|$|Chronic neuropsychiatric {{diseases}} are increasingly consuming a larger portion of healthcare costs, {{in part due}} to a lack of effective treatment techniques.

Effective treatments must seek to attenuate these network dynamics to establish normal neural communication. However, current treatments lack the spatiotemporal resolution to target networks with such specificity. The 'Injectrode' device developed here is a dual-lumen brain probe that is chronically implanted with wirelessly programmable micropumps for drug delivery on-demand. We establish the functionality of the system for repeated delivery of down to a few nanoliters of drug on-demand in vitro and in vivo, and show its biocompatibility over a 2 -month implantation. This provides the foundation for testing of the system in a disease model, as well as the incorporation of additional features such as a recording or stimulating electrode.

40|$|Despite {{decades of}} intense study, the {{mechanisms}} underlying the extraordinary dynamics of supercooled liquids {{as they approach}} the glass transition remain, at best, mis-characterized, and at worst, misunderstood. A long standing endeavor is to understand the remarkable increase of the viscosity with supercooling. Recently, a new theory of supercooled liquids has been proposed that starts from first principles, using elementary statistical mechanics arguments, to derive a form for the viscosity that contains only a single fitting parameter in its simplest form. In this we demonstrate that this exact same form may be derived from a different starting point, and then critically examine its performance. In the process we find that functional form proposed fits the viscosity data of {{a diverse group of}} 45 liquids exceptionally well over a wide temperature range, and uncover a number of interesting correlations of the single parameter with various thermodynamic quantities, <b>ultimately</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>for</b> the prediction of low temperature viscosity from high temperature data.

40|$|Neuronal–glial {{communication}} {{is essential for}} constructing the orthogonal axon scaffold in the developing Drosophila central nervous system (CNS). Longitudinal glia (LG) guide extending commissural and longitudinal axons while pioneer and commissural neurons maintain glial survival and positioning. However, the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms controlling these processes are not known. Previous studies showed that the midline function of the jing C 2 H 2 -type zinc-finger transcription factor was only partially required for axon scaffold formation in the Drosophila CNS. We therefore screened for gain-of-function enhancers of jing gain of function {{in the eye and}} identified the Drosophila homolog of the disease gene of human α-thalassemia/mental retardation X-linked (ATR-X) as well as other genes with potential roles in gene expression, translation, synaptic transmission, and cell cycle. jing and DATR-X reporter genes are expressed in both CNS neurons and glia, including the LG. Coexpression of jing and DATR-X in embryonic neurons synergistically affects longitudinal connective formation. During embryogenesis, jing and DATR-X have autonomous and nonautonomous roles in the lateral positioning of LG, neurons, and longitudinal axons as shown by cell-specific knockdown of gene expression. jing and DATR-X are also required autonomously for glial survival. jing and DATR-X mutations show synergistic effects during longitudinal axon formation suggesting that they are functionally related.

This complexity supports {{a wide range of}} new computing uses and users, but is not without cost: it has become difficult to maintain the efficiency of contemporary general purpose computing systems. Computing inefficiencies, which include nonoptimal runtimes, excessive energy use, and limits to scalability, are a serious problem that can result in an inability to apply computing to solve the world's most important problems. Beyond the complexity and vast diversity of modern computing platforms and applications, a number of factors make improving general purpose efficiency challenging, including the requirement that multiple levels of the computer system stack be examined, that legacy hardware devices and software may {{stand in the way of}} achieving efficiency, and the need to balance efficiency with reusability, programmability, security, and other goals.

40|$|The atomic-scale {{dynamical}} processes at play during film growth {{cannot be}} resolved by even the most advanced experimental methods. As such, computational methods, and chiefly classical molecular dynamics, are the only available research tools to study these processes. The investigation of key dynamical processes during thin film growth yields {{a deeper understanding of}} the film growth evolution, <b>ultimately</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>for</b> the optimization of experimental parameters and tailoring of film properties. This thesis details the study of fundamental surface dynamics processes, and the role played by primary diffusing species, during TiN film growth, here employed as a model system for transition metal nitrides in general. It is found that Ti adatoms and TiN 2 admolecules are the fastest diffusing species, and the species which most rapidly descend from islands onto the growing film. Thus, they are the main contributors and players in driving the layer-by-layer growth mode. TiN 3 admolecules, in contrast, are essentially stationary and thereby promote multilayer growth. Large-scale growth simulations reveal that tailoring the incident N/Ti ratio and N kinetic energy significantly affects the growth mode and film microstructure. The mechanical properties of ternary transition metal nitride and carbide alloys, investigated using density functional theory, are also discussed herein, in comparison to recent experimental results. By optimizing the valence electron concentration in these compounds, the occupation of shear-compliant d‑t 2 g electronic states can be maximized. The investigation of M 1 M 2 N alloys, where M 1 = Ti or V and M 2 = W or Mo, with different structures demonstrates that this optimization leads to enhanced ductility, and thereby toughness, in transition metal nitride alloys regardless of the degree of ordering on the metal sublattice. Estimations based on the calculation of the mechanical properties of the corresponding M 1 M 2 C transition metal carbide alloys indicate that these materials remain brittle.

Nomenclature for such lesions has included intumescences, excrescences, neoplasms, galls, genetic tumors, enations, and oedemata. Interchangeably using these terms causes confusion as to whether these names refer to the same or different disorders. Two {{of the most commonly}} used names are oedema and intumescence. The objective of this research was to characterize the development of lesions on ornamental sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas ‘Blackie’), tomato (Solanum lycopersicum ‘Maxifort’), interspecific hybrid geranium(Pelargonium· ‘CalienteCoral’), and bat-faced cuphea (Cuphea llavea ‘TinyMice’) to determine similarities and differences in morphology and nomenclature among these physiological disorders. Light microscopy was used to characterize differences in cross-sectional height, width, and area of lesions on each species. Additionally, leaf tissue samples were embedded in paraffin, and 10 -mm cross-sections were stained with Toluidine blue O and observed using light microscopy to identify specific cell layers involved with lesion development. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and digital photography were used to observe the microscopic and macroscopic stages of lesion development, respectively, on each species. The lesions observed on ornamental sweetpotato were significantly greater in height and area than on the other three species, whereas tomato lesions were significantly greater in width. Lesions on ornamental sweetpotato and bat-faced cuphea occurred predominantly on the adaxial surface of the leaf, whereas lesions on geraniumand tomato occurred predominantly on the abaxial surface. With lesions on tomato, ornamental sweetpotato, and bat-faced cuphea, the epidermis was often subjected to the same hypertrophy apparent in the underlying parenchyma cells, <b>ultimately</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>for</b> greater cell expansion. However, in geranium, the epidermis resisted the expansion of the underlying cells, resulting in the eventual tearing of this tissue layer. Previous research indicates that lesion development on geranium is closely related to water status within the plant and may result in a wound response or provide a means of facilitated gas exchange. On the contrary, development of lesions on ornamental sweetpotato and tomato is believed to involve light quality. Based on these results and observations, two disorders occur across these species. The term "intumescence’’ should be used when referring to abnormal lesions on ornamental sweetpotato and tomato, and the term ‘‘oedema’’ should be used when referring to lesions on geranium. The term ‘‘intumescence’’ should also be used when referring to bat-faced cuphea lesions resulting from the morphological and anatomical aspects of these lesions closely resembling development on ornamental sweetpotato and tomato. Future research should investigate the role of light quality regarding development on this species...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} patterns, {{processes}} and causes {{of economic growth}} {{at the level of}} firms and regions. How are growth rates of regional economies distributed and how do these distributions emerge? What are the implications of firm growth processes on the dynamics of regional economies? Which factors external to the firm, but internal to the region drive firm growth and what is the spatial dimension of their growth effects? And how are these factors causally related to each other at the regional level? In seven research papers, these questions are investigated on basis of comprehensive empirical data and innovative statistical approaches, taking especially into account the heterogeneity of firms, industries and space. A research gap on the stochastic characteristics of growth rates at the intermediate level between firms and countries is filled by fitting the Asymmetric Exponential Power (AEP) distribution to regional industry-specific employment data for Germany. Exploiting this additional information residing in the non-normality of the growth rates, the causal structure of economic, research, innovation and educational activities is uncovered within a structural vector autoregression framework, drawing on a unique industry-specific and multi-dimensional regional panel dataset. Introducing a conditional estimation approach of the AEP distribution {{in the context of the}} analysis of Chinese firm data, advantages from both ordinary regression and distributional approaches are combined. The role of firm dynamics for the aggregate economy is investigates by means of an empirically validated simulation models and conceptual work, in which firm dynamics assume a central role in the empirical implementation of the evolutionary perspective of regional resilience. Finally, geocoded micro-data, travel times and a flexible distance decay function approach provide more robust findings on the spatial extent of industrial clusters, unaffected from the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem, <b>ultimately</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>for</b> a more realistic assessment of the heterogeneous and firm-specific impacts of different kinds of agglomerations. The results of this thesis prove empirically the importance of taking into account the firm level dynamics and the heterogeneity across industries and space for the analysis of regional economic growth. Especially the frequency of extreme growth events, both at the level of firms and regions, and their role for regional development stand out. Besides, knowledge-generating activities are an important factor for growth, although their effects strongly depend on the industry and properties of the firm. Industrial clusters, which can take quite different spatial extensions, are not necessarily beneficial for the incumbent firms populating such a cluster.
