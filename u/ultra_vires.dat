5|$|Whether Order 123 was <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> section 3(1) of the UPA or unconstitutional.|$|E
5|$|Whether Order 179 {{was unconstitutional}} and <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> section 24(1)(a) of the SA.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Taw (the appellant) argued, first, {{that section}} 37(1) of the PCA was unconstitutional, and, secondly, that its {{enactment}} was <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> the legislative power of Parliament.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} a quashing order is to {{invalidate}} an <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> decision made by a public body, usually acting under some statutory authority. It is the most commonly sought of the prerogative orders in judicial review proceedings.|$|E
5|$|The case of Ellis v. Dubowski (1921) {{lays down}} the {{principle}} {{that there can be}} no delegation of authority to an absolute body from which no right of appeal exists. In this case, a licensing committee exercising statutory powers to license cinemas to be used for film screenings had imposed a condition in a licence that films had to be certified by the British Board of Film Censors before they could be shown. This was found to be <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> because the Board should not be made the final dictator. Furthermore, the fact that the Board had been given absolute power to prohibit films for reasons which might be private or influenced by trade considerations was sufficient to render the condition <b>ultra</b> <b>vires.</b>|$|E
5|$|As simple <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> {{concerns}} the exact powers conferred upon government ministers and statutory bodies, statutory interpretation {{is arguably the}} most important exercise the courts need to engage in to determine the scope of powers laid out in the statute. Hence, the cases decided are fact-specific and depend upon each court's interpretation of the relevant statute, making success of the judicial review somewhat unpredictable. The UK case of Attorney General v. Fulham Corporation (1921), illustrates this concept. The defendant was a statutory body establishing washhouses and baths for residents who could not afford their own washing facilities. When it subsequently established a laundry service, the defendant was declared to have acted <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> since its statutory purpose was not to carry on a business. Even though the business was carried out at a substantial loss, the statute in question did not give the defendant such a power to do so. Accordingly, the plaintiff was entitled to succeed.|$|E
5|$|Besides the 1874 Supreme Court ruling, a {{critical}} moment came on December 15, 1879, when Judge Lorenzo Sawyer of the Ninth Circuit Court ruled in Orton, 32 F. 457 (C.C.D. Cal. 1879), {{that the federal government}} controlled the railroad land grants, and more importantly, the state could not control <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> acts of corporations.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Olivier Bancoult, {{a native}} Chagossian {{and leader of}} the Chagos Refugees Group, brought a {{judicial}} review claim against the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs for the initial ordinance which led to the Chagossian removal. Bancoult sought a writ of certiorari {{on the grounds that the}} ordinance was <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> and failed the Wednesbury test of reasonableness, as it was irrational.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{a second}} Order in Council, the British Indian Ocean Territory (Constitution) Order 2004, was produced, again {{reinstating}} the off-limits {{nature of the}} Chagos Islands. Bancoult brought a second case, arguing that this Order was again <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> and unreasonable, and that the British government had violated legitimate expectation by passing the second Order after giving {{the impression that the}} Chagossians were free to return home.|$|E
5|$|No {{subsidiary}} legislation made under an Act of Parliament may be {{inconsistent with the}} provisions of any Act. This means that any {{subsidiary legislation}} that was made <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> its parent Act (that is, the Act did not confer power on the agency to make the subsidiary legislation) or is not consistent with any other statute is void {{to the extent of}} the inconsistency.|$|E
5|$|An {{injunction}} is {{an equitable}} private law remedy that restrains a public body from doing {{an act that}} is wrongful or <b>ultra</b> <b>vires.</b> Following law reforms in the United Kingdom in 1977, it became possible for the High Court of England and Wales to grant prerogative orders {{as well as a}} declaration or injunction in the same set of legal proceedings. As these reforms have not been followed in Singapore, the Singapore High Court is not empowered to grant injunctions under Order 53 of the Rules of Court.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the first}} sub-heading, a public {{authority}} {{will be considered}} as having acted illegally {{if there is no}} legal basis for the action carried out or the decision made (simple <b>ultra</b> <b>vires),</b> or, more specifically, if the authority has made an error concerning a jurisdictional or precedent fact. A precedent fact error is made when an authority comes to a conclusion in the absence of facts that must objectively exist, or in the presence of facts that must not exist, before it has the power to act or decide.|$|E
5|$|After {{requiring}} all Social Credit Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) to sign loyalty oaths to it, the Social Credit Board {{proceeded to}} recommend radical legislation regulating banking, taxing banks, and restricting {{freedom of the}} press and access to courts. Most of this legislation was either disallowed by the federal government or ruled <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> (beyond the powers of) the province by the Supreme Court of Canada; these defeats and the advent of World War II made the Social Credit Board increasingly irrelevant. In its later years it became highly anti-Semitic, and it was dissolved by the government of Ernest Manning in 1948.|$|E
5|$|Fettering of {{discretion}} {{by a public}} authority {{is one of the}} grounds of judicial review in Singapore administrative law. It is regarded as a form of illegality. An applicant may challenge a decision by an authority on the basis that it has either rigidly adhered to a policy it has formulated, or has wrongfully delegated the exercise of its statutory powers to another body. If the High Court finds that a decision-maker has fettered its discretion, it may hold the decision to be <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> – beyond the decision-maker's powers – and grant the applicant a suitable remedy such as a quashing order to invalidate the decision.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, the Minister for Information and the Arts made Order No. 405/1995 banning {{materials}} {{published by}} the International Bible Students Association, an organization associated with the Jehovah's Witnesses. In Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. Minister for Information and the Arts (1995), the plaintiffs sought leave to apply for an order of certiorari to quash the order, alleging that it was <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> as it contravened, among other things, Article 15(1) of the Constitution. Presiding over {{the case in the}} High Court, Justice Judith Prakash referred to Yong C.J.'s holding in Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. P.P. (1994) concerning the meaning of public order.|$|E
5|$|The Government Proceedings Act bars the High Court from {{granting}} injunctions {{against the}} Government {{or one of}} its officers. An injunction is an equitable private law remedy that restrains a public authority from doing an act that is wrongful or <b>ultra</b> <b>vires.</b> In place of an injunction, the Court may make a declaration concerning the parties' rights. At common law, there is no general right to claim damages – that is, monetary compensation – if rules of public law have been breached by an authority. In order to obtain damages, an aggrieved person {{must be able to}} establish a private law claim in contract or tort law.|$|E
5|$|The appellants {{contended that}} under Article 15(4) of the Constitution {{restrictions}} {{on the right of}} freedom of religion could be imposed only if public order, public health or morality is affected, and section 24(1)(a) of the SA provides for registered organizations to be dissolved only if they threaten public peace, welfare or good order. The appellants therefore submitted that {{there had to be a}} clear and immediate danger to public order before freedom of religion can be circumscribed. Since the activities of Jehovah's Witnesses posed no such threat, the deregistration order was unconstitutional and <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> the SA.|$|E
5|$|The {{case was}} first {{heard in the}} District Court. The appellants contended {{by way of a}} {{preliminary}} objection that Order 123 was <b>ultra</b> <b>vires,</b> or beyond the powers, of the UPA and contravened Article 15(1) of the Constitution of Singapore, which enshrines the right to freedom of religion. The trial judge dismissed the preliminary objection, holding that Order 123 was valid and constitutional, as the order concerned the public interest and was permitted under s 3(1) of the UPA. Accordingly, the appellants were convicted for possession of the banned publications. They appealed to the High Court against the trial judge's decision.|$|E
5|$|A {{mandatory}} order is {{an order of}} the High Court commanding a public authority to perform a public duty, while a prohibiting order operates to prevent illegal action by an authority from occurring in the first place. A quashing order, the most commonly sought prerogative order, {{has the effect of}} invalidating an <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> decision made by an authority. Obtaining a mandatory, prohibiting or quashing order is a two-stage process, as an applicant must be granted leave by the Court to apply for the order. The Court must find the existence of a proper public law issue and available grounds of review. Leave will be granted provided that an arguable and prima facie case of reasonable suspicion that the authority has acted in breach of administrative law rules is established.|$|E
25|$|A {{decision-maker}} acts in an <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> manner {{when it did}} {{not have}} the power that it purported to have, and therefore there was no basis in law for the impugned action. In Attorney General v. Fulham Corporation (1921), the court held that the Corporation was only empowered by statute to provide washing facilities for the residents to wash their clothes adequately. Hence, a laundry service implemented by the Corporation was <b>ultra</b> <b>vires.</b>|$|E
25|$|It also {{establishes}} {{that any}} {{error of law}} by a public body will result in its decision being <b>ultra</b> <b>vires.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{legitimate}} expectation does not arise {{when it is}} made <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> of the decision-maker's statutory powers, that is, when the decision-maker lacked legal power to make the representation. Courts are reluctant to protect such an expectation that has been created. The rationale is undoubtedly clear and rests on {{the scope of the}} administrative authority's powers. It prevents public authorities from expanding their powers simply by making <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> representations. Secondly, allowing public authorities to be bound by their <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> representations may potentially prevent them from exercising their statutory powers or duties. Also, allowing a public authority to be bound could be unfair to third parties who are affected. However, courts may be obliged to protect {{legitimate expectation}}s arising from representations by unauthorized officers of the public body.|$|E
25|$|There {{were some}} bona fide {{reasons for the}} <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> {{approach}} - specifically to limit the potential for local government to compete with private enterprise.|$|E
25|$|In 1899, Lord Watson {{asserted}} {{during the}} argument in CPR v Bonsecours that neither the federal parliament nor the provincial legislatures could give legislative authority to the other level. Subsequent attempts to dovetail federal and provincial legislation to achieve certain ends met with difficulty, such as an attempt by Saskatchewan to ensure enforcement of a federal statute by enacting a complementary Act declaring that the federal Act would continue in force under provincial authority if it was ruled <b>ultra</b> <b>vires.</b> The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal ruled a federal and provincial Act <b>ultra</b> <b>vires,</b> voiding both as {{an attempt by the}} province to vest powers in parliament unauthorized by the BNA Act.|$|E
25|$|Entering into {{contracts}} for {{the fulfillment of}} other functions within its powers. However a contract between a municipality and another party to do something outside of its charter is <b>ultra</b> <b>vires,</b> and therefore unenforceable as a nullity.|$|E
25|$|However, in English law, the {{decision}} in Anisminic Ltd. v. Foreign Compensation Commission (1968) is seen as having done away with the distinction, even though {{that was not the}} intention of the House of Lords. In R. v. Lord President of the Privy Council, ex parte Page (1992), it was held that since Parliament only confers power on a public authority on the basis that it is to be exercised on the correct legal basis, any misdirection in law will render {{the decision}} <b>ultra</b> <b>vires.</b> Thus, in general, all errors of law are now considered as jurisdictional and <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> in a broad sense of the term, and the High Court can intervene to correct them.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{civil unions}} are solely {{in the provincial}} domain and have no {{relevance}} here. As such, section 2 of the legislation is <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> the federal government. Any legislation protecting freedom of religion with respect to marriage must be done through provincial legislation.|$|E
25|$|In 1532 he {{took part}} in the {{proceedings}} of the convocation which decided that the King's marriage was contrary to divine law, and consequently that the pope's dispensation was <b>ultra</b> <b>vires,</b> and which drew up the articles about religion,' of which the original may be seen, with John Bell's name attached, in the Cotton Library.|$|E
25|$|The {{matter was}} {{addressed}} in 1950 by the Supreme Court, which held <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> a proposed Nova Scotia Act {{which would have}} authorized the inter-delegation of legislative and taxation authority between Parliament and the Nova Scotia legislature. In that decision, Justice Rand explained the distinction between delegation to a subordinate body and that to a legislative body.|$|E
25|$|The term {{procedural}} impropriety {{was used}} by Lord Diplock in the House of Lords decision Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service ("the GHCQ case", 1984) to explain that a public authority could be acting <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> (that is, beyond the power given to it by statute) if it commits a serious procedural error. His Lordship regarded procedural impropriety as one of three broad categories of judicial review, the other two being illegality and irrationality. Procedural impropriety generally encompasses two things: procedural <b>ultra</b> <b>vires,</b> where administrative decisions are challenged because a decision-maker has overlooked or failed to properly observe statutory procedural requirements; and common law rules of natural justice and fairness. United Kingdom administrative law has {{played a significant role}} in helping to shape Singapore law in this area, given the weight accorded to UK cases by the courts in Singapore.|$|E
25|$|In {{considering}} unreasonableness in the Wednesbury sense, {{the court}} is not entitled to substitute its view of how the discretion should be exercised for what was actually done, nor is unreasonableness established if the court merely comes {{to the view that}} such a policy or guideline may not work effectively as another, since {{the court is}} not exercising an appellate function in respect of administrative decisions. The applicant has the burden of proving that the policy or guideline is illegal or <b>ultra</b> <b>vires.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sometimes the {{capacity}} of either natural or artificial persons to either enforce contracts, or have contracts enforced against them is restricted. For instance, very small children may not be held to bargains they have made, {{on the assumption that}} they lack the maturity to understand what they are doing; errant employees or directors may be prevented from contracting for their company, because they have acted <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> (beyond their power). Another example might be people who are mentally incapacitated, either by disability or drunkenness.|$|E
25|$|In {{a fourth}} case, the {{consequences}} of incapacity are more drastic. Although the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 {{made it possible for}} the government or emanations of the state to be sued on contracts {{in the same way as}} a normal individual, where statute confers power on a public body to do certain acts, actions by representatives beyond that power will be <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> and void. The result is the same as it was for companies before reform in 1989, so that whole chains of agreements could be declared as non-existent.|$|E
25|$|In her {{discourse}} on Ex parte Coughlan, Melanie Roberts opined that {{the requirement of}} abuse of power could apply in cases of <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> promises as well. In deciding whether to allow a public body which had made a promise beyond its power to renege on its promise, the court would need to balance the public interest and the private interest, legality and certainty. If the private interest outweighs the public interest then the court should hold {{that it would be}} an abuse of power for the public body to resile from the representation.|$|E
25|$|An {{injunction}} is {{a remedy}} having {{the effect of}} preventing the party to whom it is addressed from executing certain <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> acts. An injunction that is positive in nature may also be granted to compel performance of a particular act. This remedy is not available in Singapore in relation to public law. The Government Proceedings Act prevents the court from imposing injunctions or ordering specific performance in any proceedings against the Government. However, in place of such relief, the court may make an order declaratory of the rights between parties.|$|E
25|$|A 1975 {{report for}} the Australian state of Victoria found that the Dockyards etc. Protection Act 1772 was still {{apparently}} in force, as the sections of the Criminal Damage Act 1971 that repealed the Dockyards Act explicitly applied only to the United Kingdom. However, the offence of arson in royal dockyards is considered obsolete in Victoria, as the provisions have been superseded by the Victorian Crimes Act 1958 and the Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914–1973. New South Wales also retained it, as it was viewed as being <b>ultra</b> <b>vires</b> for the Parliament of New South Wales to amend it.|$|E
