50|$|The Crusader {{was used}} by the British Army as a 6Ã—4 {{tow-truck}} (with EKA <b>underlift</b> equipment) and as a 6x4 tractor unit normally used for towing 35-tonne plant trailers or 30-tonne tank bridge transport trailers. A recovery variant was also in use. The British Army replaced the Crusader in the late 1990s by a Seddon Atkinson tractor unit with a 40-tonne plant trailer and a specialist tank bridge transporter.Many have seen use in the heavy haulage industry due to their incredibly strong chassis.|$|E
50|$|For a long while, it {{was common}} to use 'dollies' to recover vehicles. These were cranes and <b>underlifts</b> as above, but mounted on a two-wheeled axle. They were {{designed}} to be towed behind a suitable towing vehicle. Another portable device was a crane, which clipped on to an articulated tractor unit's fifth wheel coupling. Popular in the seventies and eighties, they were cheap to buy (compared with a purpose-built recovery vehicle) and appealed to fleet operators, who could use them to recover their own vehicles. Total lift dollies were carried by some spectacle lifts to place under the wheels {{at the opposite end}} to the lifted wheels, thereby converting the half lift into a total lift. These are used, for example, when a vehicle has had an accident and both ends are damaged.|$|R
6000|$|I {{have been}} waiting eagerly for this {{invitation}} and I follow Captain Hodgson from the control-platform, stooping low to avoid the bulge of the tanks. We know that Fleury's gas can lift anything, as the world-famous trials of '89 showed, but its almost indefinite powers of expansion necessitate vast tank room. Even in this thin air the lift-shunts are busy taking out one-third of its normal lift, and still [...] "162" [...] must be checked by an occasional downdraw of the rudder or our flight would become a climb to the stars. Captain Purnall prefers an overlifted to an <b>underlifted</b> ship; but no two captains trim ship alike. [...] "When I take the bridge," [...] says Captain Hodgson, [...] "you'll see me shunt forty per cent of the lift out of the gas and run her on the upper rudder. With a swoop upward instead of a swoop downward, as you say. Either way will do. It's only habit. Watch our dip-dial! Tim fetches her down once every thirty knots as regularly as breathing." ...|$|R
