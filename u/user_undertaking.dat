40|$|AbstractIt is {{proposed}} that an optimal strategy for executing a join query in a distributed database {{system may be}} computed in a time which is bounded by a polynomial function {{of the number of}} relations and the size parameters of the network. The solution so unveiled considers both the transmission costs and the processing costs incurred in delivering the required result to the user that issued the query. The query specifies that several relational tables are to be coalesced and presented to the appropriate <b>user.</b> <b>Undertaking</b> this task demands the utilisation of limited system resources, so that a strategy for fulfilling the request that imposes minimal cost to the system should be devised. Both the processor sites, and the communications links that interconnect them, are utilised; an optimal strategy is one that minimises a weighted sum of processing and data transmission costs. An integer linear programming model of this problem was originally proposed in [1]; however, no suggestion was given as to how this model might be efficiently solved. By extending the earlier analysis, the recursive nature of the join computation is revealed. Further investigations then produce a modified relationship amenable to algorithmic solution; the resultant procedure has polynomial time and space requirements...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the differences between a game with a realistic narrative context and one with a more fantastical narrative context, in terms of perceived game relevance and game-specific self-efficacy. Users who played the game with the more realistic narrative exhibited greater perceived relevance and greater game-specific self-efficacy, in comparison with their counterparts. The more realistic narrative may allow for the material being learned to be better incorporated into the underlying narrative, thus increasing the perceived relevance of the game overall. The more realistic context may have yielded an increased game-specific self-efficacy due to the increased feasibility of the actions <b>users</b> <b>undertake</b> in the game. Using Yi & Hwang’s (2003) Technology Acceptance Model, we suggest that the increased game relevance and self-efficacy that result from a more realistic context {{can be used to}} increase the amount of time users spend using the learning game.

40|$|Abstract—Several new browser {{primitives}} {{have been}} pro-posed {{to meet the}} demands of application interactivity while enabling security. To investigate whether applications consistently use these primitives safely in practice, we study the real-world usage of two client-side primitives, namely postMessage and HTML 5 ’s client-side database storage. We examine new purely client-side communication protocols layered on postMessage (Facebook Connect and Google Friend Connect) and several real-world web applications (including Gmail, Buzz, Maps and others) which use client-side storage abstractions. We find that, in practice, these abstractions are used insecurely, which leads to severe vulnerabilities and can increase the attack surface for web applications in unexpected ways. We conclude the paper by offering insights into why these abstractions can potentially be hard to use safely, and propose the economy of liabilities principle for designing future abstractions. The principle recommends that a good design for a primitive should minimize the liability that the <b>user</b> <b>undertakes</b> to ensure application security. I...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{it has become clear}} that {{networked}} information environments need to be closely integrated with the environments in which their <b>users</b> <b>undertake</b> their mainstream tasks and activities. The EDNER project, undertaking a formative evaluation of a major national information environment, provided an opportunity to explore the ways in which information resources were being integrated into learning and teaching within the United Kingdom. In this paper the Director of the EDNER project describes the work that has been carried out and summarises some of the key findings. The paper suggests that integration between different environments, including those delivering information and those supporting learning, is the key requirement. As we move towards ever more complex networked environments, including those driven by complex interactions between "objects" of many different kinds, {{it will be necessary to}} revisit the underlying theories and paradigms which have been developed by researchers and practitioners operating within their own areas of expertise. ...|$|R

The Technology Integration Group (TIG) is evaluating a number of tools designed to make parallel programming easier, including tools for source analysis, program development and execution analysis. The more effective tools will be 'mainstreamed', i. e. turned over to users, integrated into workshops and consulted on by staff. " This provides an update to that status report. The major section ofthis paper describes Tools for Parallel Programming, divided into 12 categories. Each category is summarized in pretty much the same way as in 1989, and then new status and prospects are discussed. The paper concludes with some comments on hybrid program development systems andthe workstation environment.

Is there a difference in the motor and process skills during activities of daily living performance, and in the time taken to complete the activities. Four individuals/participants with hemiplegia were used in a cross over, repeated measures trial. Assessment of Motor and Process Skills of <b>users</b> <b>undertaking</b> making a bed and laying a table ‘Swedish style’, tasks were measured and time taken to complete each task were recorded.

Activities of daily living tasks in the Neater Uni-wheelchair were completed more efficiently with no loss in quality of motor and process skills performance. This suggests that the Neater Uni-wheelchair is a viable alternative to current one arm drive provision. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{literacy}} {{level of}} {{a significant part of}} the Brazilian population is insufficient for a proficient use of computers and for an autonomous access to digital contents as those currently available on the Internet. Although this problem also exists in other developing countries, its features depend on many sociocultural and educational factors that distinguish each country. Thus, most of the studies on digital inclusion of illiterate <b>users</b> <b>undertaken</b> abroad, as is often the case in studies for countries in Asia and Africa, are not totally suited to Brazil’s context, which is mainly characterized by a higher prevalence of functional illiteracy rather than by full illiteracy, and in which multiligualism is marginal. Hence, besides the use of icons as supporters in understanding digital contents, as often proposed for those other countries, we particularize the problem to Brazil by investigating how icons reinforce the reading skills of semi-literate users, a key issue given the literacy level of many Brazilian citizens. Thus, this paper addresses both the use of icons in supporting digital content navigation and their role in scaffolding limited reading skills when accessing digital contents...|$|R
50|$|Information {{asymmetry}} has {{a significant}} negative effect on most insurance environments, where typical considerations include inability to distinguish between users of different (high and low risk) types, i.e., the so-called adverse selection problem, as well as <b>users</b> <b>undertaking</b> actions that adversely affect loss probabilities after the insurance contract is signed, i.e., the so-called moral hazard problem. The challenge due to the interdependent and correlated nature of cyber-risks is particular to cyber-insurance and differentiates traditional insurance scenarios (e.g., car or health insurance) from the former. In a large distributed system such as the Internet, risks span a large set of nodes and are correlated. Thus, user investments in security to counter risks generate positive externalities for other users in the network. The aim of cyber-insurance here is to enable individual users to internalize the externalities in the network so that each user optimally invests in security solutions, thereby alleviating moral hazard and improving network security. In traditional insurance scenarios, the risk span is quite small (sometimes it spans {{only one or two}} entities) and uncorrelated, thus internalizing the externalities generated by user investments in safety, is much easier.|$|R
