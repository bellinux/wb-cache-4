40|$|This paper {{adopts a}} {{communication}} perspective on public electronic forms (e-forms). By doing so we define forms as instruments for communication and, thus, also instruments through which citizens perform different communicative actions towards government agencies. As such instruments, the forms {{might be more}} or less useful. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to explore what features of an e-form that increase the communication quality. We conduct a theoretical synthesis of three existing approaches for designing information systems. The result is a combined theory on key features of an e-form that make the establishment of communication quality more likely. The result consists of four key concepts, each of which give rise to one set of design principles for communication from the issuer of the e-form to the <b>user</b> (<b>citizen),</b> and one set of design principles for communication from the <b>user</b> (<b>citizen)</b> to the recipient of the e-form...|$|E

For many of these citizens, the web interface has become the only method of communication with the public service agency and the primary method of obtaining information about transit services. This model-based, multi-method study analyzes data from more than 450 survey respondents and twenty-four focus group participants, seeks to understand the end <b>user</b> <b>citizen</b> trust experience in their interaction with e-government transit web sites.

40|$|The article {{deals with}} {{features}} of e-governance and e-communication, as {{important elements of}} new management of the public sector. The author points out {{that one of the}} most important principles of new management is customer orientation. This principle ensures a move from the Weberian type of bureaucratic administration, limited to hierarchical procedures, towards a fl exible and <b>user</b> (<b>citizen)</b> friendly public administration. The author considers the results of a study of e-communication of the Slovenian civil service with citizens; he observes the sending of e-mail messages (questions) by citizens to the general e-mail address of an administrative institution. In the study, messages have been sent to the most important institutions of civil service and government institutions. Based on the results of the study, the author concludes that Slovenia has managed to achieve some basic elements necessary for the development of e-governance, and e-communication between citizens and civil service. However, the author concludes that a further reform of civil service is necessary in Slovenia in terms of its informatisation, which will encourage further changes in the administrative culture of civil servants and the increase of their willingness to work in a fl exible working environment...|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{harmonization}} of accounting {{standards in the}} Italian system deserves different level of analysis. In our country, the need to harmonize all the existing accounting standards {{in the public sector}} is well known; in these late years the incentive for their amendment to ensure consistency in the regulatory system has been very strong. At the same time more and more the internal rules need to be aligned to the new European and international binding principles which often require a new concept of work flow in order to support comparative and information analysis. Hence, harmonization needs, on one hand, to take into account all the guidelines that in the latest 15 years have driven the behavioral change in management and accounting within the public sector (with particular reference to the ones stated in the DPR n. 97 / 2003); on the other, it needs to consider the external regulatory reviews which have modified the configuration of accounting tools and documents used for compartmental comparative analysis both at European level (CAFOG model-Classification of the Function of Government e SEC ‘ 95) and worldwide (IAS and IPSAS principles). Widening the perspective, the harmonization of accounting standards must also meet other dynamic and more complex requirements arising both from public governance {{as well as from the}} expectations of the relevant large number of stakeholders. Under this view, the harmonization of the accounting standards should create a unified logic between the accounting system and the accountability system, so to give valuable information to every end <b>user</b> (<b>citizen).</b> In other words, the Italian system should be analyzed not only under the specific perspective of public governance, but also under the complex structure of government, meaning all processes, responsibilities, decision levels and evaluation criteria which take part to the innovation process of public administrations. The set of standards to be defined in the harmonization process should be able to create a transparent, clear and simple network of golden rules, to be easily implemented and capable to increase quality and control in the diversified scenario of public entities...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the state of}} intellectual activity within social work under the conditions of neo-liberalism. It is motivated by concern with the demise of what previously was termed ‘bottom-up’ social work and {{a growing sense of}} despair amongst front line social workers regarding their capacity to engage with <b>users,</b> <b>citizens</b> and communities in ways other than those determined by managerial and regulatory mechanisms. This leads us into a discussion about the possibilities of what it might mean for social workers {{to think of themselves as}} ‘intellectuals’. It considers the different meanings of the term ‘intellectual’ and argues that social work has much to gain from the tradition which has identified new kinds of public sector professionals as ‘transformative intellectuals’...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the widely}} {{recognized}} importance of <b>users,</b> consumers and <b>citizens</b> in sustainability transitions, transition studies offer highly fragmented perspectives {{that make it}} difficult to discern their various roles in sustainable innovation. This paper therefore has two aims: (1) to clarify how <b>users,</b> consumers and <b>citizens</b> have been conceptualized in transition studies literature, and (2) to synthesize a typology of <b>user,</b> consumer and <b>citizen</b> roles. Because expert reviews tend to be highly selective and interpretive, we opted for a systematic literature review and compiled a set of 349 papers that refer <b>user,</b> consumer or <b>citizen</b> in their title or abstract, and also cite one of 100 ‘core publications’ in the transition studies field. To decrease bias and increase reproducibility, we use a systematic software-assisted content analysis that facilitates the disentanglement of multiple perspectives on a phenomenon of interest. It allows deep exploration of large collections of texts through classification of documents, the discovery of recurring themes, the identification of keywords, and the extraction of meaningful contexts in which these appear. A bottom-up thematic document classification (on the level of integral abstracts) reveals four categories of abstracts that correspond with the empirical domains of energy, mobility, food and water. A bottom-up thematic analysis of elementary contexts (on the level of sentences) highlights six significant themes across these empirical domains: transition, stakeholder, user, practice, market, and methodology. We interpret the significance of these themes and how they relate to our research interest. Then, to explore our research interest more in-depth, we use top-down (supervised) methods for exploring the contexts in which <b>user,</b> consumer and <b>citizen</b> appear. We find that though there is some degree of overlap, the terms are used mostly in different contexts and methods, and with different aims. Finally, we synthesize our findings into a typology of <b>user,</b> consumer and <b>citizen</b> roles along two dimensions: resist – produce, and individual – collective...|$|R

Beyond the basic democratic principle that {{people have a right}} to be involved in decisions affecting their livelihoods, values and ways of life, community engagement and participation are seen as ways to reduce conflicts over managing resources, ensure that social strategies and, perhaps most importantly, 'capture' and apply local knowledge (Lockie 2001). Scientific organisations and regulatory agencies are no longer seen as the sole repositories of relevant knowledge and expertise. Government and corporate policies and expenditures are no longer seen as being sufficient to address environmental problems. Resolving the environmental challenges of our time is seen as such a large and complex set of tasks as to require all citizens to be actively involved...|$|R
50|$|Criticism: NITB's {{roll out}} of the e-Office suite across almost all federal {{agencies}} is not only overly ambitious but also likely to fail. It seems {{to put together a}} lot of lofty organizational efficiency goals with a set of delivery or citizen-facing targets. In fact, most of the services NITB has provided have been largely conceptual and not sufficient concrete. The process outlines in the adoption process diagram seems devoid of any user-centric design or value proposition formulation. Instead of creating lots of MVPs (Minimum Viable Products) and taking advantage of an iterative and validated learning the process, the e-Office Suite seems to incorporate all the features and functions that various ministries and divisions may need or use. It seems to focus more on the needs of the bureaucrats and government agencies rather than the needs of the end <b>user</b> (<b>citizens</b> of Pakistan) and what services would they need that a ministry or division can provide.|$|R

Participatory Rural Appraisal or Participatory Reflection and Action (PRA) have been used in such different areas as ”natural resource management, social protection, poverty appraisals, agriculture, health, women’s empowerment, HIV/AIDS … ” (Chambers, 2012, p. 73). A central idea of Participatory Action Research (PAR) is that it is the local communi-ties themselves who inquire into and develop their praxis in order to produce their own understanding and sustainable solutions of their day-to-day prob-lems (Fals-Borda, 2001; Cendales, 2005). Participatory Research involves relevant stakeholders, too. It might take on many different forms as e. g. participatory budgeting in Brazil (Streck, 2006).

Through this review, we argue that the quest for memory is an ethical issue in itself. With the proposed ‘right to be forgotten and erasure’ online in Europe, a number of controversies were raised among the political and public spheres. We looked at the online media to investigate ethical issues raised. We discuss the ethics of the RtbF through five main dilemmas that emerged from both literature and the online media: the hybrid online-offline life reinforces hybrid roles for <b>users</b> (<b>citizens,</b> journalists, teachers, archivists, and so on); what constitutes private and collective memory is blurred; the values by which memory is preserved cannot be left to specific elites; the RtbF has awaken the forgetting and forgiving dilemma and; is settling clashes with other rights.

To engage the citizens, the pilot makes use of Gamification based entities (intelligent wireless sensors) embedded in public hardware, through which innovative games are organized in places of interest (neighbourhood, parks, schools, etc.). Once finished, this pilot will be re-used in other European cities under the context of CIP SMART IP project. Since, the success of a pilot in one city doesn't guarantee its success in the other, an objective socio-economic-organizational reuse assessment becomes critical. To do this assessment, we propose a framework, which uses a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) based scorecard to determine the roadblocks and battlefields that could deter such a transition...|$|R

Individual (“atomic”) services are integrated on semantic level (using semantic description of ex-isting services – either traditional or e-services) into a scenario, realization of which leads to a solution of a problem faced by the end <b>users</b> (<b>citizens</b> or businesses) in a given life event (e. g. how to get a building permit, establish company etc.). Benefits for the end users are twofold: firstly they are provided with higher value-added services – a scenario of services (consisting of a series of services, including their dependencies), not just a single services; the services in the scenario are personalised (i. e. adapted to his/her personal data and/or situation). In case some services in the scenario are available electronically, they can be also executed online, increasing thus ultimate benefits to the end user.

We survey the main methodological properties of these indicators, and uncover the principal stylized facts and trends; at the same time, we highlight their heuristic limits and potential inconsistencies. Finally, we address empirically the issue of the explanation of the indexes scores – i. e. how the supply of the various eServices in each country is affected by political, institutional and socio-economic differences, and is followed by actual usage. The econometric analysis uncovers the importance of broadband penetration and higher education as drivers for most of the types of eServices and <b>users</b> (<b>citizens</b> and businesses). Moreover, a corruption-free and agile public sector shows up to be an important pre-condition for more effective supply and usage. Despite severe data limits and the complexity of the underlying diffusion phenomena, our study of eServices availability and usage across European countries is a first empirical contribution aimed at disentangling broad empirical trends – with their correlates - from unresolved methodological issues. As such, this work appears useful to inform the policy debate and practice, in a phase characterized by a prospective reorientation of public eServices provision. ...|$|R
