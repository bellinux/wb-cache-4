5|$|Risk parity is a {{conceptual}} approach to investing which attempts {{to provide a}} lower risk and lower fee alternative to the traditional portfolio allocation of 60% stocks and 40% bonds which carries 90% of its risk in the stock portion of the portfolio (see illustration). The risk parity approach attempts to equalize risk by allocating funds to {{a wider range of}} categories such as stocks, government bonds, credit-related securities and inflation hedges (including real assets, commodities, real estate and inflation-protected bonds), while maximizing gains through financial leveraging. According to Bob Prince, CIO at Bridgewater Associates, the defining parameters of a traditional risk parity portfolio are <b>uncorrelated</b> assets, low equity risk, and passive management.|$|E
5|$|The company divides its {{investments}} {{into two}} basic categories: (1) Beta investments, whose returns are generated through passive management and standard market risk, and (2) Alpha investments, whose {{goal is to}} generate higher returns that are <b>uncorrelated</b> to the general market and are actively managed. The principle of separating alpha and beta investments was introduced by Dalio in 1990 and gained the recognition of other equity managers beginning in the year 2000. The firm {{is reported to be}} the first hedge fund manager to separate alpha and beta investment strategies and offer dedicated investment funds for each.|$|E
5|$|Risk parity advocates {{assert that}} the unlevered risk parity {{portfolio}} is quite close to the tangency portfolio, as close as can be measured given uncertainties and noise in the data. Theoretical and empirical arguments are made {{in support of this}} contention. One specific set of assumptions that puts the risk parity portfolio on the efficient frontier is that the individual asset classes are <b>uncorrelated</b> and have identical Sharpe ratios. Risk parity critics rarely contest the claim that the risk parity portfolio is near the tangency portfolio but they say that the leveraged investment line is less steep and that the levered risk parity portfolio has slight or no advantage over 60% stocks / 40% bonds, and carries the disadvantage of greater explicit leverage.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that even}} though the {{observations}} may be <b>uncorrelated,</b> the parameters are typically correlated.|$|E
25|$|When {{the data}} errors are <b>uncorrelated,</b> all {{matrices}} M and W are diagonal. Then, take {{the example of}} straight line fitting.|$|E
25|$|In {{microelectronics}} engineering, Monte Carlo {{methods are}} applied to analyze correlated and <b>uncorrelated</b> variations in analog and digital integrated circuits.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{condition}} that the errors are <b>uncorrelated</b> with the predictor variables, LLSQ yields unbiased estimates, but even under that condition NLLSQ estimates are generally biased.|$|E
25|$|A second {{limitation}} is that gene-environment correlation is not detectable {{as a distinct}} effect. Addressing this limit requires incorporating adoption models, or children-of-twins designs, to assess family influences <b>uncorrelated</b> with shared genetic effects.|$|E
25|$|This {{can also}} be derived from the {{additivity}} of variances, since the total (observed) score {{is the sum of}} the predicted score and the error score, where the latter two are <b>uncorrelated.</b>|$|E
25|$|When unit weights {{are used}} (W = I, the {{identity}} matrix), it is {{implied that the}} experimental errors are <b>uncorrelated</b> and all equal: M = σ2I, where σ2 is the a priori variance of an observation.|$|E
25|$|Portfolio diversification: Depending on the securitization, {{hedge funds}} {{as well as}} other {{institutional}} investors tend to like investing in bonds created through securitizations because they may be <b>uncorrelated</b> to their other bonds and securities.|$|E
25|$|Conscientiousness {{significantly}} correlates {{positively with}} right-wing authoritarianism. Although right-wing authoritarianism {{is one of}} the most powerful predictors of prejudice, a large scale meta-analysis found that conscientiousness itself is <b>uncorrelated</b> with general prejudice. Conscientiousness is positively correlated with support for capital punishment.|$|E
25|$|The {{permutations}} {{of factor}} levels comprising a single treatment are so chosen that their responses are <b>uncorrelated</b> and hence each treatment gives a unique piece of information. The {{net effect of}} organizing the experiment in such treatments {{is that the same}} piece of information is gathered in the minimum number of experiments.|$|E
25|$|In {{the output}} stream 0 and 1 are equally likely, as 10 and 01 are equally {{likely in the}} original, both having {{probability}} pqnbsp&=nbsp&qp. This extraction of uniform randomness {{does not require the}} input trials to be independent, only <b>uncorrelated.</b> More generally, it works for any exchangeable sequence of bits: all sequences that are finite rearrangements are equally likely.|$|E
25|$|Pooling many {{mortgages}} with <b>uncorrelated</b> default probabilities {{creates a}} bond with a much lower probability of total default, in which no homeowners {{are able to make}} their payments (see Copula). Although the risk neutral credit spread is theoretically identical between a mortgage ensemble and the average mortgage within it, the chance of catastrophic loss is reduced.|$|E
25|$|The OLS {{estimator}} {{is consistent}} when the regressors are exogenous, and optimal {{in the class}} of linear unbiased estimators when the errors are homoscedastic and serially <b>uncorrelated.</b> Under these conditions, the method of OLS provides minimum-variance mean-unbiased estimation when the errors have finite variances. Under the additional assumption that the errors are normally distributed, OLS is the maximum likelihood estimator.|$|E
25|$|These moment {{conditions}} {{state that}} the regressors should be <b>uncorrelated</b> with the errors. Since xi is a p-vector, the number of moment conditions {{is equal to the}} dimension of the parameter vector β, and thus the system is exactly identified. This is the so-called classical GMM case, when the estimator does not depend on the choice of the weighting matrix.|$|E
25|$|This {{implies that}} in a {{weighted}} sum of variables, the variable with the largest weight will have a disproportionally large weight in the variance of the total. For example, if X and Y are <b>uncorrelated</b> {{and the weight of}} X is two times the weight of Y, then the weight of the variance of X will be four times the weight of the variance of Y.|$|E
25|$|The Pearson {{correlation}} is +1 in {{the case}} of a perfect direct (increasing) linear relationship (correlation), −1 {{in the case}} of a perfect decreasing (inverse) linear relationship (anticorrelation), and some value in the open interval (−1, 1) in all other cases, indicating the degree of linear dependence between the variables. As it approaches zero there is less of a relationship (closer to <b>uncorrelated).</b> The closer the coefficient is to either −1 or 1, the stronger the correlation between the variables.|$|E
25|$|Both the EPQ and Big Five {{approaches}} extensively use self-report questionnaires. The {{factors are}} intended to be orthogonal (<b>uncorrelated),</b> though there are often small positive correlations between factors. The five factor model in particular {{has been criticized for}} losing the orthogonal structure between factors. Hans Eysenck has argued that fewer factors are superior to a larger number of partly related ones. Although these two approaches are comparable because of the use of factor analysis to construct hierarchical taxonomies, they differ in the organization and number of factors.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{from the}} Ising model and repeating this {{iteration}} eventually changes all the couplings. When {{the temperature is}} higher than the critical temperature, the couplings will converge to zero, since the spins at large distances are <b>uncorrelated.</b> But when the temperature is critical, there will be nonzero coefficients linking spins at all orders. The flow can be approximated by only considering the first few terms. This truncated flow will produce better and better approximations to the critical exponents when more terms are included.|$|E
25|$|In 1810, {{after reading}} Gauss's work, Laplace, after proving the central limit theorem, {{used it to}} give a large sample {{justification}} for the method of least square and the normal distribution. In 1822, Gauss was able to state that the least-squares approach to regression analysis is optimal {{in the sense that}} in a linear model where the errors have a mean of zero, are <b>uncorrelated,</b> and have equal variances, the best linear unbiased estimator of the coefficients is the least-squares estimator. This result is known as the Gauss–Markov theorem.|$|E
25|$|The risk-free asset is the (hypothetical) asset {{that pays}} a risk-free rate. In practice, {{short-term}} government securities (such as US treasury bills) {{are used as}} a risk-free asset, because they pay a {{fixed rate of interest}} and have exceptionally low default risk. The risk-free asset has zero variance in returns (hence is risk-free); it is also <b>uncorrelated</b> with any other asset (by definition, since its variance is zero). As a result, when it is combined with any other asset or portfolio of assets, the change in return is linearly related to the change in risk as the proportions in the combination vary.|$|E
25|$|Also, in Taiwan, another contradiction was {{the radio}} call signs {{for the fire}} trucks or rescue vehicles. For reasons to avoid {{unwanted}} attentions and to remain secrecy, all radio call signs for all police vehicles were <b>uncorrelated</b> with the missions of the subject vehicles, unnecessarily including fire trucks, rescue vehicles, and ambulances of fire brigades. When fire police teams were responding to an emergency situation, these confusing call signs inevitably led to chaos and time delay. A successful fire chief, Chao Kang (趙鋼), convinced the police high command to rearrange the radio call sign assignment for all fire vehicles. Chao Kang then was appointed as the Commissioner of Taiwan Provincial Fire Administration, and the Director-General of National Fire Agency from 10 September 2000 to September 2002.|$|E
25|$|NMDA receptors {{are found}} {{throughout}} the post-synaptic membrane and act as a coincidence detector. The NMDA detects both glutamate released by pre-synaptic vesicles and depolarization of the post-synaptic membrane. The NMDA receptor exhibits voltage-dependent block by magnesium ions. Depolarization of the post-synaptic membrane (i.e. backward propagating dendritic spike) causes the magnesium ion {{to be removed from}} the channel, favoring channel opening. NMDA receptor activation thereby allows calcium influx. Neurons that “fire together wire together” refer to strengthening of synaptic connections through NMDA receptors when glutamate release is coincident with post-synaptic depolarization. This form of wiring is known as long term potentiation. Synaptic connection can also be weakened when the activity of neurons is <b>uncorrelated,</b> also known as long term depression.|$|E
25|$|Measuring {{the spin}} of these {{entangled}} particles along anti-parallel directions—i.e., {{along the same}} axis but in opposite directions, the set of all results is perfectly correlated. On the other hand, if measurements are performed along parallel directions they always yield opposite results, and the set of measurements shows perfect anti-correlation. This is {{in accord with the}} above stated probabilities of measuring the same result in these two cases. Finally, measurement at perpendicular directions has a 50% chance of matching, and the total set of measurements is <b>uncorrelated.</b> These basic cases are illustrated in the table below. Columns should be read as examples of pairs of values that could be recorded by Alice and Bob with time increasing going to the right.|$|E
25|$|A {{direct field}} is {{generated}} by audio drivers arranged to encircle the test article. Two different control schemes {{can be used to}} perform a direct field test. One method, known as single-input-single-output or SISO, uses a single drive signal to all acoustic drivers with multiple control microphones averaged to produce the control measurement. This method will produce a set of correlated plane waves that may combine to produce large magnitude variations creating local fluctuations on the test article surface. Magnitude variations as much as +/−12dB can be experienced. The second method, known as MIMO, uses multiple independent drive signals to control multiple independent microphone locations. This method produces a more <b>uncorrelated</b> field that is much more uniform than the SISO field. Magnitude variations in the range of +/-3dB are typical when using MIMO control.|$|E
25|$|Games such as {{the game}} of chicken and hawk-dove game in which players score highest when they choose {{opposite}} strategies, i.e., discoordinate, are called anti-coordination games. They have reaction correspondences (Figure 4) that cross {{in the opposite direction}} to coordination games, with three Nash equilibria, one in each of the top left and bottom right corners, where one player chooses one strategy, the other player chooses the opposite strategy. The third Nash equilibrium is a mixed strategy which lies along the diagonal from the bottom left to top right corners. If the players do not know which one of them is which, then the mixed Nash is an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS), as play is confined to the bottom left to top right diagonal line. Otherwise an <b>uncorrelated</b> asymmetry is said to exist, and the corner Nash equilibria are ESSes.|$|E
25|$|It {{follows from}} {{theory that the}} Kalman filter is the optimal linear filter in cases where a) the model {{perfectly}} matches the real system, b) the entering noise is white (<b>uncorrelated)</b> and c) the covariances of the noise are exactly known. Several methods for the noise covariance estimation have been proposed during past decades, including ALS, mentioned in the section above. After the covariances are estimated, {{it is useful to}} evaluate the performance of the filter; i.e., whether it is possible to improve the state estimation quality. If the Kalman filter works optimally, the innovation sequence (the output prediction error) is a white noise, therefore the whiteness property of the innovations measures filter performance. Several different methods can be used for this purpose. If the noise terms are non-Gaussian distributed, methods for assessing performance of the filter estimate, which use probability inequalities or large-sample theory, are known in the literature.|$|E
25|$|In {{statistic}}s, the Durbin–Watson statistic is a {{test statistic}} used to detect the presence of autocorrelation (a relationship between values separated from each other by a given time lag) in the residuals (prediction errors) from a regression analysis. It is named after James Durbin and Geoffrey Watson. The small sample distribution of this ratio was derived by John von Neumann (von Neumann, 1941). Durbin and Watson (1950, 1951) applied this statistic to the residuals from least squares regressions, and developed bounds tests for the null hypothesis that the errors are serially <b>uncorrelated</b> against the alternative that they follow a first order autoregressive process. Later, John Denis Sargan and Alok Bhargava developed several von Neumann–Durbin–Watson type test statistics for the null hypothesis that the errors on a regression model follow a process with a unit root against the alternative hypothesis that the errors follow a stationary first order autoregression (Sargan and Bhargava, 1983). Note that the distribution of this test statistic {{does not depend on}} the estimated regression coefficients and the variance of the errors.|$|E
25|$|Among the {{investigations}} into post-surgical stereopsis is {{a publication of}} 2005 that reported on a total of 43 adults over 18 years of age who had surgical correction after having lived with from constant-horizontal strabismus for more than 10 years with no previous surgery or stereopsis, with visual acuity of 20/40 or more also in the deviating eye; in this group, stereopsis was present in 80% of exotropes and 31% of esotropes, with the recovery of stereopsis and stereoacuity being <b>uncorrelated</b> {{to the number of}} years the deviation had persisted. A study that was published 2006 included, aside an extensive review of investigations on stereopsis recovery of the last decades, a re-evaluation of all those patients who had had congenital or early-onset strabismus with a large constant horizontal divergence and had undergone strabismus surgery in the years 1997–1999 in a given clinic, excluding those who had a history of neurologic or systemic diseases or with organic retinal diseases. Among the resulting 36 subjects aged 6–30 years, many had regained binocular vision (56% according to an evaluation with Bagolini striated glasses, 39% with Titmus test, 33% with Worth 4-dot test, and 22% with Random dot E test) and 57% had stereoacuity of 200 sec of arc of better, leading to the conclusion that some degrees of stereopsis can be achieved even in cases of infantile or early-childhood strabism. Another study  found that some chronically strabismic adults with good vision could recover fusion and stereopsis by means of surgical alignment.|$|E

It uses [...] "quantitative" [...] {{investment}} {{methods to}} identify new investments while avoiding unrealistic historical models.
