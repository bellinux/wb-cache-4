50|$|Malta's European <b>Union</b> <b>application,</b> {{which was}} put on hold by the {{previous}} Labour government, was reactivated and negotiations were concluded by December 2002. Fenech Adami successfully led the pro-EU movement in the 2003 EU membership referendum campaign, and won the successive election. He signed Malta's Accession Treaty with the European Union on 16 April 2003, and represented Malta in various EU Summits and Commonwealth meetings. In December 2003, he received the European of the Year 2003 Award from the influential Brussels-based newspaper European Voice in recognition of his unfaltering efforts to bring Malta into the European Union. Fenech Adami resigned as Leader of the Nationalist Party in February 2004, resigning his premiership and giving up his parliamentary seat on 23 March 2004, thus becoming the longest serving Prime Minister since Malta's independence.|$|E
5000|$|Agricultural Workers Organization's Secretary-Treasurer Walter Nef {{designated}} {{two types}} of delegates, field delegates (or walking delegates) and stationary delegates, who organized in main wheat belt towns without continuous migration. [...] Field delegates were agricultural workers who recruited new members and acted as representatives of the AWO. Field delegates carried materials such as: <b>union</b> <b>application</b> materials, union membership dues books, dues stamps, and Wobbly literature necessary to recruit agricultural workers. Compensation for field delegates was based on commission per new member so it was an incentive to recruit as many new members as possible. To recruit members to the AWO, field delegates sometimes freight trains in and around harvest areas and demand to see a Red Card, proof of membership to the IWW, from all other riders. If a hobo could not produce a membership card, the field delegates forced the rider to purchase a card or get off the train. By doing so, the AWO hoped to create an [...] "800 mile picket line" [...] along the wheat belt ensuring the IWW controlled all harvest jobs. They were also organizers at the workplace and presented grievances to the ranch foremen and farmers; holding full organizer's responsibilities, delegates {{had the ability to}} call a strike against a farmer if the farmer did not address grievances. Field delegates had direct contact with other agricultural workers and were able to experience the working conditions at the field level; direct communication with both workers and ranch foremen, including farmers, allowed for negotiation of wages and delegates would not accept jobs that paid under the union scale of $3 per day. [...] The delegate system effectively recruited new members and established multiple locals of the AWO, but not many recruits stayed with the union due to the migrant nature.|$|E

In order to assess the overall degree of therapeutic innovation of these drugs, we considered, for each approved agent, its target, the availability of previous treatments {{and the extent of}} its therapeutic effect. The following scores for therapeutic innovation were assigned through a consensus process: ‘A’ (important), ‘B’ (moderate) and ‘C’ (modest). The overall degree of important/moderate therapeutic innovation was 47 % of all therapeutic agents (32 % important; 15 % moderate). Most (80 %) of the EMEA-approved therapeutic agents were for serious diseases. The remaining ones were for risk factors (7 %) or nonserious diseases (13 %) ...|$|R

It has also been pointed out that even though the Activity theoretical framework can beneficially be used in the development of information systems, actual attempts to apply it to concrete projects are only occasional. This study explores the use of Activity Theory in an organisational context where the subject is of marked collective nature, in an information systems development project for the Swedish National Trade Union Confederation (LO). Both implications of the study as regards the specific trade <b>union</b> <b>application,</b> and more general implications of applying Activity Theory to studies of entire organisations and for system development, are discussed...|$|E
40|$|A {{growing problem}} confronting users of {{remotely}} sensed imagery {{is whether the}} use of additional or different imagery to improve decision quality is actually justified by its cost. This paper dis-cusses how to compare these competing factors so that an ac-ceptable trade-off may be made between them. The proposed method is based on probabilistic cost-benefit analysis. The concept of “value of information ” is introduced in a practical case study using remote sensing to verify farmers ’ declarations for a crop subsidy program in the European <b>Union.</b> <b>Application</b> of the method requires that (1) the problem at hand can be represented by a decision tree, (2) the desirability of each de-cision outcome can be expressed numerically, (3) the imagery reveals information about the occurrence of events not under the decision maker’s control, and (4) the probabilities of these events {{and the extent to}} which they are detectable in remotely sensed imagery can be assessed...|$|E

40|$|Protection of the {{appellation}} {{of origin}} under Czech law and international treaties This thesis deals with the topic of {{appellation of origin}}. Appellation of origin is governed by Czech law, European Union law and by international multilateral and bilateral treaties. Appellation of origin is an exceptional measure because it provides an indefinite number of users meeting prescribed conditions with protection. The paper is divided into four chapters. The first chapter deals with history and with theoretical introduction into the topic of appellations of origin. Following three chapters describe the protection in the Czech Republic, European Union and on the international level. There are examples of concrete appellations of origin {{at the end of}} each of these three chapters. The examples are used in order to better demonstrate different ways of possible use of the appellations of origin. The work uses legal enactments as well as administrative and court decisions. Specialized publications and opinions of some of the users are used as well. The core of legal regulations governing appellations of origin in many countries is formed by multilateral international treaties. This applies also in case of the Czech Republic and the European <b>Union.</b> <b>Application</b> for registration of an appellation of origin may be filled [...] ...|$|E

Using inflation data based on harmonized consumer price indices for 1999 - 2007, the first principal component is stationary. This suggests that all EU national inflation rates are driven by a single common stochastic trend. Further analysis suggests that the national degrees of persistence with respect to deviations in inflation from long-run equilibrium are varied...|$|R
