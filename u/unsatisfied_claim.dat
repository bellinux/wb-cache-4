Martinez concerned an illegal immigrant, Victor Manuel Caballero, who was injured during an accident while riding in an uninsured vehicle {{driven by an}} unlicensed person. The <b>Unsatisfied</b> <b>Claim</b> and Judgment Fund, set up to cover injuries by uninsured drivers, refused to compensate him as he wasn't a legal resident. The Court on hearing his case overruled two lower courts and declared Caballero {{to be entitled to}} compensation from the fund, stating that [...] "a person may be a 'resident' even if the intent to remain ultimately is not realized". Previously an individual who had lived five months with relatives was not a resident with respect to the Fund.|$|E

40|$|This diploma thesis {{with the}} titled Creditors' claims in Insolvency {{proceeding}} {{deals with the}} possibility of setting up the claims of creditors in case that the court declared the debtor insolvent and was therefore initiated insolvency proceeding according to the Act no. 182 / 2006 Col., on Insolvency and Its Resolution (Insolvency Act). The introduction of the thesis also pays attention to other possibilities of enforcing and lodging the claims whether in extrajudicial proceedings or in proceedings before the court by filing an action against the debtor or in proceedings before the court or arbitration and subsequent recovery options of enforceable claims. The main aim of this thesis is to present a detailed analysis of the process of submission of claims in insolvency proceedings from the moment of initiation of the proceeding through submission of the claims to the insolvency court to their reviewing and their possible denial (together with adversary disputes) or their finding and final satisfaction. The chapter that describes the different types of claims is also closely related to the process of submitting, reviewing and satisfaction of claims as the type of the claim may determine whole process of its submission and satisfaction in the insolvency proceeding. Last chapters describe the satisfaction of admitted claims depending to the chosen method of the insolvency resolution and the destiny of <b>unsatisfied</b> of <b>claims</b> when the insolvency proceeding is over. At the end of the thesis is a practical example that should illustrate the procedure of filling the Claim submission form, including all elements of formal and content requirements...|$|R
40|$|Large-scale {{consumers}} of {{information such as}} lecturers and researchers have nowadays widely adopted the digital document. These professionals cannot suffice with disaggregate data but instead need full text documents. These documents include the research production of their colleagues and the teaching resources designed {{both within and outside}} their institution – be they commercially published or not. The main source of information for these professionals is the Internet, which has become a victim of its own success. If lecturers and researchers claim to have gained better information accessibility, thanks to the Web, they still must account for the time needed to examine the results obtained. Moreover, many of these net-users still camp with difficulties in information retrieval, where all too often their results are unsuccessful or unsatisfactory. University lecturers and researchers at an Engineering College in Nantes on the West coast of France base this paper on a survey that examines the use of and performance with digital documents. The study was conducted during the year 2003 with about 70 persons from various fields and disciplines including physics, computer science, sociology, etc. This study looks at the lecturer-researcher in the capacity of information seeker and reveals a rather sedentary and autonomous figure, one who first relies on the resources offered by his/her own computer. Even though they are partly <b>unsatisfied,</b> they <b>claim</b> no time to waste on improving their information search skills. New tools bringing relevant, rich, and reliable scientific information and documentation are of interest to them. Certainly, if this would help them capture that which would otherwise have been neglected when only classical search techniques are applied. However, these tools must be simple to use, fast, and available where and when needed. This study is part of a user-centered design approach in the construction of an open archive platform, planned to create institutional repositories that will be managed by librarians in their respective institutions. Using this tool, the authors would be able to store, convert (XML), fully index, perpetuate, valorize, and distribute their digital documents. For those using, managing and/or developing such platforms, {{the results of this study}} could be used in understanding lecturers and researchers behavior and expectations. Likewise, through the use of statistics derived from this study, it is a first step in weighing our convictions and formulating questions on future digital library users.

60|$|First, {{there was}} the subject seldom absent from his mind, the question, what he was to do {{henceforth}} in life; to what occupation he should devote himself, and in what direction he had best seek it. He was far from rich, and every day of indecision and inaction made his inheritance a source of greater anxiety to him. As often {{as he began to}} consider how to increase this inheritance, or to lay it by, so often his misgiving that there was some one with an <b>unsatisfied</b> <b>claim</b> upon his justice, returned; and that alone was a subject to outlast the longest walk. Again, {{there was the}} subject of his relations with his mother, which were now upon an equable and peaceful but never confidential footing, and whom he saw several times a week. Little Dorrit was a leading and a constant subject: for the circumstances of his life, united to those of her own story, presented the little creature to him as the only person between whom and himself there were ties of innocent reliance on one hand, and affectionate protection on the other; ties of compassion, respect, unselfish interest, gratitude, and pity. Thinking of her, and of the possibility of her father's release from prison by the unbarring hand of death--the only change of circumstance he could foresee that might enable him to be such a friend to her as he wished to be, by altering her whole manner of life, smoothing her rough road, and giving her a home--he regarded her, in that perspective, as his adopted daughter, his poor child of the Marshalsea hushed to rest. If there were a last subject in his thoughts, and it lay towards Twickenham, its form was so indefinite that it was little more than the pervading atmosphere in which these other subjects floated before him.|$|E
6000|$|We {{came away}} from Cordova with a pretty good {{conscience}} as to its sights. Upon the whole we were glad they were so few, when once we had made up our minds about the mosque. But now I have found too late {{that we ought to}} have visited the general market in the old square where the tournaments used to take place; we ought to have seen also the Chapel of the Hospital del Cardenal, because {{it was part of the}} mosque of Al-Manssour; we ought to have verified the remains of two baths out of the nine hundred once existing in the Calle del Bagno Alta; and we ought finally to have visited the remnant of a Moorish house in the Plazuela de San Nicolas, with its gallery of jasper columns, now unhappily whitewashed. The Campo Santo has an <b>unsatisfied</b> <b>claim</b> upon my interest because it was the place where the perfervid Christian zealots used to find the martyrdom they sought at the hands of the unwilling Arabs; and where, far earlier, Julius Caesar planted a plane tree after his victory over the forces of Pompeii at Munda. The tree no longer exists, but neither does Caesar, or the thirty thousand enemies whom he slew there, or the sons of Pompeii who commanded them. These were so near beating Casar at first that he ran among his soldiers [...] "asking them whether they were not ashamed to deliver him into the hands of boys." [...] One of the boys escaped, but two days after the fight the head of the elder was brought to Caesar, who was not liked for the triumph he made himself after the event in Rome, where it was thought out of taste to rejoice over the calamity of his fellow-countrymen as if they had been foreign foes; the Romans do not seem to have minded his putting twenty-eight thousand Cordovese to death for their Pompeian politics. If I had remembered all this from my Plutarch, I should certainly have gone to see the place where Caesar planted that plane tree. Perhaps some kind soul will go to see it for me. I myself do not expect to return to Cordova.|$|E
60|$|It {{was from}} Henrietta Stackpole that she learned how Caspar Goodwood {{had come to}} Rome; an event that took place three days after Lord Warburton's departure. This latter fact had been preceded by an {{incident}} of some importance to Isabel--the temporary absence, once again, of Madame Merle, {{who had gone to}} Naples to stay with a friend, the happy possessor of a villa at Posilippo. Madame Merle had ceased to minister to Isabel's happiness, who found herself wondering whether the most discreet of women might not also by chance be the most dangerous. Sometimes, at night, she had strange visions; she seemed to see her husband and her friend--his friend--in dim, indistinguishable combination. It seemed to her that she had not done with her; this lady had something in reserve. Isabel's imagination applied itself actively to this elusive point, but every now and then it was checked by a nameless dread, so that when the charming woman was away from Rome she had almost a consciousness of respite. She had already learned from Miss Stackpole that Caspar Goodwood was in Europe, Henrietta having written to make it known to her immediately after meeting him in Paris. He himself never wrote to Isabel, and though he was in Europe she thought it very possible he might not desire to see her. Their last interview, before her marriage, had had quite the character of a complete rupture; if she remembered rightly he had said he wished to take his last look at her. Since then he had been the most discordant survival of her earlier time--the only one in fact with which a permanent pain was associated. He had left her that morning with a sense of the most superfluous of shocks: it was like a collision between vessels in broad daylight. There had been no mist, no hidden current to excuse it, and she herself had only wished to steer wide. He had bumped against her prow, however, while her hand was on the tiller, and--to complete the metaphor--had given the lighter vessel a strain which still occasionally betrayed itself in a faint creaking. It had been horrid to see him, because he represented the only serious harm that (to her belief) she had ever done in the world: he was the only person with an <b>unsatisfied</b> <b>claim</b> on her. She had made him unhappy, she couldn't help it; and his unhappiness was a grim reality. She had cried with rage, after he had left her, at--she hardly knew what: she tried to think it had been at his want of consideration. He had come to her with his unhappiness when her own bliss was so perfect; he had done his best to darken the brightness of those pure rays. He had not been violent, and yet there had been a violence in the impression. There had been a violence at any rate in something somewhere; perhaps it was only in her own fit of weeping and in that after-sense of the same which had lasted three or four days.|$|E

Nuosekliai atliekama analizė, straipsnio pabaigoje pateikiamos pagrindinės išvados bei rekomendacija. Straipsnyje identifikuojama, kad Europos Sąjungos teisė nereglamentuoja įmonės nemokumo sampratos, tačiau nustato būtinumą visoms Europos Sąjungos (toliau - ES) šalims laikytis universalumo principo. Taip pat yra atskleidžiami bankroto bylos pagal Europos Sąjungos ir Lietuvos Respublikos teisę iškėlimo tikslai, kad bankroto byla negali būti keliama įmonėms, kurios patiria laikinus finansinius sunkumus, o prioritetas turi būti teikiamas įmonės išsaugojimui. Išanalizuojama ir įvertinama įmonės nemokumo samprata ir jos įvertinimo kriterijai Lietuvos Respublikos įmonių bankroto įstatyme ir teismų praktikoje. Šiame straipsnyje remiantis Lietuvos Respublikos įmonių bankroto įstatymu ir atlikta Lietuvos teismų praktikos analize, apibrėžiamas nemokumo kriterijus, kaip savarankiškas bankroto bylos iškėlimo pagrindas ir atsiribojama nuo kitų šiame įstatyme reglamentuojamų trijų kriterijų gilesnės analizės. Taip pat yra apibrėžiama laikinų finansinių sunkumų turinčios įmonės samprata. Atskleidžiama įmonės nemokumo samprata ir taikomi įvertinimo metodai ekonomikos moksle. Gretinami ir įvertinami per ekonomikos mokslo teoriją bei praktiką nemokumas ir jo įvertinimas, įtvirtinti Lietuvos Respublikos teisėje. Atlikus analizę pateikiamos pagrindinės išvados ir rekomendacija inicijuoti Lietuvos Respublikos įmonių bankroto įstatymo pataisą, dėl įmonės nemokumo sąvokos apibrėžimo. Company {{insolvency}} and {{bankruptcy legislation}} {{is based on}} the discipline of economics, under such circumstances the law itself and any act, norms, provisions falling under the law are subject to micro economic problems arising in companies. Under such circumstances law has to serve economy while making reasonable decisions regarding company financial status (solvency). Unfortunately, only recently Lithuanian legal doctrine has given it a thought of using economic analysis of law. In general bankruptcies of companies cause consequences such as – loss of productivity capacity which eventually causes overall loss of national competitiveness, unpaid national taxes to many different government bodies and other institutions, <b>unsatisfied</b> <b>claims</b> of other creditors, also social problems such as growing unemployment, decline in living conditions, unsatisfied and insecure residents about country’s economy, government and their own future. According to Lithuanian Republic Department of Enterprise Bankruptcy Management under the Ministry of Economy conducted study on bankruptcies for the period between January 1 st, 1993 and March 31 st, 2014 total number of declared bankruptcies for companies is 14 912. Significant 70 % of companies that went bankrupt were in business for more than 5 years. All of collected experience in technologies, optimized processes, workplaces etc. is most likely lost with bankruptcies of such developed companies. In the article the economic analysis of law, comparative analysis, systematic analysis, logical analysis, document analysis, analytical-critical analysis, linguistic analysis methods were used to support the answer to legal question of whether insolvency evaluation criteria in Lithuanian Republic Enterprise Bankruptcy Law ensure that bankruptcy procedures would not be initiated for companies with temporary financial issues. Part one of the article states that European Union Law does not regulate company insolvency concept, but does obligate all Union countries to follow principle of universality. Proper evaluation of company’s absolute insolvency and bankruptcy initiation decision are extremely important steps in decision-making process so that bankruptcies would not be initiated to companies, which only have short-term financial difficulties. Although in 2004 Lithuania joined European Union, which does have directly applicable European Council regulation of 2000, May 29 th (EB) Nr. 1346 / 2000 regarding enterprise bankruptcy policy, since then not in any other Act or regulation of the Union have been clearly stated or added regarding regulation (evaluation) of company insolvency, bankruptcy evaluation proceedings, which leaves an open area for each Union country to freely compose their own proceedings within boundaries of principle of universality. Part two of the article is intended to identify the issues of Case law in Lithuanian court system in the area of initiated enterprise bankruptcy proceedings, whereas at bankruptcy initiation proceedings interests of creditors are prioritized and balance of interests of all other involved parties is mostly excluded from bankruptcy initiation evaluation conditions. Even though courts are trying to amend, guide faulty legislation through Case law, but from legislative perspective such actions are not fully legitimate. In part three company insolvency concept in Lithuanian Enterprise bankruptcy law and in Case law is analyzed, compared and evaluated with assistance of economic disciplinary theoretical and practical methods. In Lithuanian Enterprise bankruptcy law there is only a single ratio according to which courts make their verdict regarding proceedings of companies’ insolvency – overdue liabilities to assets ratio. Despite that there is no clear detailed proceeding of solvency evaluation in Lithuanian law whatsoever, in Case law it is stated that case by case basis additional requirements, regulations, proceedings or rules shall be evaluated regardless of current sole indicating company insolvency datum, which is ratio of overdue liabilities to assets. Under such circumstances courts have to look back at Case law which is formulated by subjective opinions of judges from past cases, and that leads to irregular and with discrepancies from economic theories and practices evaluation of companies’ insolvency. As specialists of economic field state that a single ratio of one aspect does not reflect company’s true solvency status, analysis of company insolvency is a complex process of using different financial ratios from company’s financial data. In order to determine company’s financial status economists mostly suggest to use at least ten financial ratio indicators. In order to correct such unsound and unbalanced evaluation of companies’ insolvency, clear regulations have to be stated in Lithuanian Enterprise bankruptcy law for it to have financially and legally correct and just companies’ insolvency evaluation. In the end of the article after all the analysis, in the last part reasoned recommendation is stated to initiate amendment of Lithuanian Enterprise bankruptcy law...|$|R
