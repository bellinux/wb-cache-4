40|$|Detailed element {{analyses}} {{were carried out}} on 12 black and seven <b>yellow</b> <b>glasses</b> from the K/T boundary section at Beloc (Haiti), and of three samples from smectite mantles around black glasses. The results obtained for bulk black and <b>yellow</b> <b>glasses</b> show differences between these, confirming the results of Sigurdsson et al. (1991) and Izett (1991), and {{the results obtained on}} individual spherules and shards are in agreement with bulk data. The present data also demonstrate, for the first time, the existence of <b>yellow</b> <b>glass</b> samples with high CaO but low S contents, which might have formed by fusion of various proportions of carbonates and evaporites or carbonates alone. One of the black glasses was found to have higher than average SiO 2 and K 2 O abundances but lower concentrations of all other major elements. This suggests the existence of a third glass type, named the high Si-K variety (HSi,K) glass...|$|R

50|$|In 1658 Count Ádám Batthyány {{founded a}} glass factory there; the first {{official}} record of the village dates to 1698. The glass works were noted for the manufacture of a beautiful <b>yellow</b> <b>glass</b> resulting from the admixture of sulphur, but the glassmaking enterprise required enormous quantities of firewood, and both Glasshütten bei Schlaining and the nearby village of Günseck were required to supply the factory.|$|R

40|$|The Apollo 15 <b>yellow</b> impact <b>glasses</b> are {{characterized}} by moderate TiO 2 (about 4. 8 %) and high abundances of the large ion lithophile elements (e. g., K, P, Hf, Th, REE). Since the chemistry of these glasses cannot be duplicated by any combination of local components presently known to occur at the Apollo 15 landing site, these <b>yellow</b> <b>glasses</b> seem to be exotic to that area. Chemical and petrologic constraints suggest that these samples were produced by impact melting of an immature mare regolith developed upon an unusual variety of mare basalt. It is speculated that the target basalts were the youngest lava flows known to exist on the moon (i. e., Eratosthenian-age lavas in Oceanus Procellarum and Mare Imbrium). Specific tests are proposed for evaluating this provocative hypothesis...|$|R

40|$|Multispectral {{mapping of}} the Apollo 15 -Apennine region {{has allowed the}} {{identification}} of numerous dark mantle deposits of probable pyroclastic origin. The deposits display a low albedo, appear to mantle and slightly subdue subjacent terrain, are spectrally distinct on the multispectral maps (high in the infrared but low in the ultraviolet) and generally exhibit a weak depolarized 3. 8 cm radar echo. These characteristics are consistent with an origin by pyroclastic eruption. The regional dark mantle deposits are commonly associated with vents along marginal fractures and faults near {{the base of the}} Apennines, thereby emphasizing the role of basin-controlled weaknesses in providing channels for the upward migration of magma generated at depth. The spectral properties of the pyroclastic deposits are incompatible with those of Apollo 15 green glass but the deposits may be composed of material similar to the Apollo 15 brown or <b>yellow</b> <b>glass.</b> If so, the widespread distribution of the deposits suggest that mare basalts genetically related to the brown or <b>yellow</b> <b>glass</b> may occur in the Apollo 15 region. Moreover, pyroclastic volcanic activity has apparently been a more important and widespread process in the Apollo 15 -Apennine region than has previously been thought...|$|R
