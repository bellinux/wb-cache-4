30|$|In 1977, Husain [10] {{initiated}} {{the concept of}} supra-open sets, which is considered as a wider class of some known types of near-open sets. In 1983, Mashhour et al. [11] defined the concept of S-continuity for a single-valued function f:(X,τ)→ (Y,σ). Many topological properties of the above-mentioned concepts {{and others have been}} established in [3, 12]. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present the upper (lower) supra-continuous harmonic multifunction as a generalization of <b>upper</b> (lower) <b>semi-continuous</b> harmonic multifunctions in the sense of Berge [13], the upper (lower) quasi-continuous and the upper (lower) precontinuous harmonic multifunctions defined by Popa [14], and also upper (lower) α-continuous and upper (lower) β-continuous harmonic multifunctions defined by Wine [15]. Moreover, characterization of these new harmonic multifunctions by many their properties has also been established.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the supports {{of a class}} of real-valued maps on C*(X) introduced by Radul. Using this description, a characterization of compact-valued retracts of a given space in terms of functional extenders is obtained. For example, if X⊂ Y, then there exists a continuous compact-valued retraction from Y onto X {{if and only if}} there exists a normed weakly additive extender u C*(X) → C*(Y) with compact supports preserving (resp.,) and weakly preserving (resp.,). Similar characterizations are obtained for <b>upper</b> (resp., lower) <b>semi-continuous</b> compact-valued retractions. These results provide characterizations of (not necessarily compact) absolute extensors for zero-dimensional spaces, as well as absolute extensors for one-dimensional spaces, involving non-linear functional extenders.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} continuous and <b>upper</b> and lower <b>semi-continuous</b> real {{functions in the}} framework of TTE, Type- 2 Theory of Effectivity. First some basic facts about TTE are summarized. For each of the function spaces, we introduce several natural representations based on different intiuitive concepts of "effectivity" and prove their equivalence. Computability of several operations on the function spaces is investigated, among others limits, mappings to open sets, images of compact sets and preimages of open sets, maximum and minimum values. The positive results usually show computability in all arguments, negative results usually express non-continuity. Several of the problems have computable but not extensional solutions. Since computable functions map computable elements to computable elements, many previously known results on computability are obtained as simple corollaries...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we prove the {{following}} fixed point theorem. Consider a non-empty bounded polyhedron P and a function Æ : P → P such {{that for every}} x є P for which Æ (x) ≠ x there exists δ > 0 such that for all y, z є B (x, δ) ∩ P it holds that (Æ(y) -y) 2 (Æ(z) -z) ≤ 0, where B (x, δ) is the ball in Rⁿ centered at x with radius δ. Then Æ has a fixed point, i. e., there exists a point x* є P satisfying Æ (x*) = x*. The condition allows for various discontinuities and irregularities of the function. In case f is a continuous function, the condition is automatically satisfied and thus the Brouwer fixed point theorem is implied by the result. We illustrate that a function that satisfies the condition is not necessarily <b>upper</b> or lower <b>semi-continuous.</b> A game-theoretic application is also discussed. mathematical economics and econometrics;...|$|R
40|$|We {{prove the}} {{existence}} of a subgame-perfect epsilon-equilibrium, for every epsilon > 0, in a class of multi-player games with perfect information, which we call free transition games. The novelty is that a non-trivial class of perfect information games is solved for subgame-perfection, with multiple non-terminating actions, in which the payoff structure is generally not (<b>upper</b> or lower) <b>semi-continuous.</b> Due to the lack of semi-continuity, there is no general rule of comparison between the payoffs that a player can obtain by deviating a large but finite number of times or, respectively, infinitely many times. We introduce new techniques to overcome this difficulty. Our construction relies on an iterative scheme which is independent of E and terminates in polynomial time with the following output: for all possible histories h, a pure action a(1) (h) or in some cases two pure actions a(h) (2) and b(h) (2) for the active player at h. The subgame-perfect epsilon-equilibrium then prescribes for every history h that the active player plays a(h) (1) with probability 1 or respectively plays a(h) (2) with probability 1 - delta(epsilon) and b(h) (2) with probability delta(epsilon) Here, delta(epsilon) is arbitrary {{as long as it is}} positive and small compared to epsilon, so the strategies can be made "almost" pure.
