40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test the {{hypothesis}} that cardiopulmonary baroreflex control of forearm vascular resistance (FVR) during central hypervolemic loading was less sensitive in exercise trained high fit individuals (HF) compared to untrained average fit individuals (AF). Eight AF (age: 24 +/- 1 yr and weight: 78. 9 +/- 1. 7 kg) and eight HF (22 +/- 1 yr 79. 5 +/- 2. 4 kg) voluntarily participated in the investigation. Maximal aerobic power (determined on a treadmill), plasma volume and blood volume (Evans blue dilution method) were significantly greater in the HF than AF (60. 8 +/- 0. 7 vs. 41. 2 +/- 1. 9 ml. kg- 1. min- 1, 3. 96 +/- 0. 17 vs 3. 36 +/- 0. 08 1, and 6. 33 +/- 0. 23 vs 5. 28 +/- 0. 13 1). Baseline heart rate (HR), central venous pressure (CVP), mean arterial pressure (MAP, measured by an intraradial catheter or a Finapres finger cuff), forearm blood flow (FBF, plethysmography), and FVR, calculated from the ratio (MAP-CVP) /FBF, were not different between the HF and the AF. Lower body negative pressure (LBNP, - 5, - 10, - 15, and - 20 torr) and passive leg elevation (LE, 50 cm) combined with lower body positive pressure (LBPP, + 5, + 10, and + 20 torr) were utilized to elicit central hypovolemia and hypervolemia, respectively. Range of CVP (from LBNP to LE+LBPP) was similar in the AF (from - 3. 9 to + 1. 9 mm Hg) and HF (from - 4. 0 to + 2. 2 mm Hg). However, FVR/CVP was significantly less in the HF (- 1. 8 +/- 0. 1 <b>unit.</b> <b>mm</b> Hg- 1) than AF (- 34 +/- 0. 1 <b>unit.</b> <b>mm</b> Hg- 1). The FVR decrease in response to increase in CVP was significantly diminished in the HF (- 1. 46 +/- 0. 45 <b>unit.</b> <b>mm</b> Hg- 1) compared to the AF (- 4. 40 +/- 0. 97 <b>unit.</b> <b>mm</b> Hg- 1), and during LBNP induced unloading the FVR/CVP of the HF (- 2. 01 +/- 0. 49 <b>unit.</b> <b>mm</b> Hg- 1) was less (P < 0. 08) than the AF (- 3. 28 +/- 0. 69 <b>unit.</b> <b>mm</b> Hg- 1). We concluded that the cardiopulmonary baroreceptor mediated FVR reflex response was significantly less sensitive to changes in CVP in individuals who practice exercise training...|$|E

40|$|Background: b-value is the {{parameter}} {{characterizing the}} intensity of the diffusion weighting during image acquisition. Data acquisition is usually performed with low b value (b~ 1000 s/mm 2). Evidence shows that high b-values (b> 2000 s/mm 2) are more sensitive to the slow diffusion compartment (SDC) and maybe more sensitive in detecting white matter (WM) anomalies in schizophrenia. Methods: 12 male patients with schizophrenia (mean age 35 +/- 3 years) and 16 healthy male controls matched for age were scanned with a low b-value (1000 s/mm 2) and a high b-value (4000 s/mm 2) protocol. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) {{is a measure of the}} average diffusion distance of water molecules per time <b>unit</b> (<b>mm</b> 2 /s). ADC maps were generated for all individuals. 8 region of interests (frontal and parietal region bilaterally, centrum semi-ovale bilaterally and anterior and posterior corpus callosum) were manually traced blind to diagnosis. Results: ADC measures acquired with high b-value imaging were more sensitive in detecting differences between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls than low b-value imaging with a gain in significance by a factor of 20 - 100 times despite the lower image Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Increased ADC was identified in patient's WM (p= 0. 00015) with major contributions from left and right centrum semi-ovale and to a lesser extent right parietal region. Conclusions: Our results may be related to the sensitivity of high b-value imaging to the SDC believed to reflect mainly the intra-axonal and myelin bound water pool. High b-value imaging might be more sensitive and specific to WM anomalies in schizophrenia than low b-value imagin...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} force {{applied to a}} 430 micron single fiber, {{delivering}} 60 pulses of 308 nm XeCl laser radiation at 20 Hz, on the ablation depth in porcine aortic tissue under saline has been investigated. Energy densities of 8, 15, 25, 28, 31, 37, and 45 mJ/mm 2 were used. Force was applied by adding weights from 0 to 10 grams to the fiber. The fiber penetration was monitored {{by means of a}} position transducer. At 0 grams, the ablation depth increased linearly with incident energy density, but the fiber did not penetrate the tissue; with any weight added, the fiber penetrated the tissue at energy densities above 15 mJ/mm 2. The fiber did not penetrate during the first several pulses, possibly due to gas trapped under the fiber. After these first pulses, a smooth linear advancement of the fiber began, which lasted until the pulse train stopped. The ablation depth increased with increasing energy densities and weights. This effect was largest above 25 mJ/mm 2 where the ablation efficiencies (<b>unit</b> <b>mm</b> 3 /J), with weights added to the fiber, were substantially larger than values found in 308 nm ablation experiments described in the literature, which were conducted with either a focused laser beam or a fiber without additional force. The results imply that in 308 nm excimer laser angioplasty, force must be applied to the beam delivery catheter for efficient recanalization, and that experiments performed with a focused beam or without actual penetration of the fiber do not represent the situation encountered in excimer laser angioplast...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess intra- and {{interobserver}} {{variability of}} fetal biometry measurements throughout pregnancy. METHODS: A total of 175 scans (of 140 fetuses) were prospectively performed at 14 - 41 weeks of gestation ensuring an even distribution throughout gestation. From among three experienced sonographers, {{a pair of}} observers independently acquired a duplicate set of seven standard measurements for each fetus. Differences between and within observers were expressed in measurement <b>units</b> (<b>mm),</b> {{as a percentage of}} fetal dimensions and as gestational age-specific Z-scores. For all comparisons, Bland-Altman plots were used to quantify limits of agreement. RESULTS: When using measurement <b>units</b> (<b>mm)</b> to express differences, both intra- and interobserver variability increased with gestational age. However, when measurement of variability took into account the increasing fetal size and was expressed as a percentage or Z-score, it remained constant throughout gestation. When expressed as a percentage or Z-score, the 95 % limits of agreement for intraobserver difference for head circumference (HC) were ± 3. 0 % or 0. 67; they were ± 5. 3 % or 0. 90 and ± 6. 6 % or 0. 94 for abdominal circumference (AC) and femur length (FL), respectively. The corresponding values for interobserver differences were ± 4. 9 % or 0. 99 for HC, ± 8. 8 % or 1. 35 for AC and ± 11. 1 % or 1. 43 for FL. CONCLUSIONS: Although intra- and interobserver variability increases with advancing gestation when expressed in millimeters, both are constant {{as a percentage of the}} fetal dimensions or when reported as a Z-score. Thus, measurement variability should be considered when interpreting fetal growth rates...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} Balloon {{expandable}} Micro Stent™ (Applied Vascular Engineering Canada, Inc) were analyzed. This stent {{is unique in}} that it comes premounted on a balloon in non articulated multiples of 4 <b>mm</b> <b>units.</b> The stent is available in 4, 8 and 12 mm lengths. The short stent unit length allows it {{to be used in}} short lesions, tortuous anatomy, and for complex situations such as stent delivery through a deployed stent. 16 lesions in 15 patients (pts) were treated with Micro stent. A one <b>unit</b> (4 <b>mm)</b> stent was used in 3 lesions, a 2 <b>unit</b> (8 <b>mm)</b> stent in 3 lesions and a 3 <b>unit</b> stent (12 <b>mm)</b> stent in 8 lesions respectively. Indication for stent implantation was elective in 15 lesions and for acute closure after balloon angioplasty in 1 lesion. Vessel distribution was 8 LCX (50 %). 5 RCA (31 %) and 3 LAD (19 %). In 8 lesions (50 %) other types of stents (Palmaz-Schatz, Gianturco-Roubin or Wiktor stent) were deployed. The reason for the selection of Micro Stent was failed stent delivery using other type of stents in 9 (56 %). tortuous vessel in 4 lesions and for 3 short lesions. Stent deployment in 8 (50 %) lesions were performed through a previously deployed stent. There was 1 delivery failure due to a failure to pre dilate the lesion. Intracoronary ultrasound was performed to confirm the optimal stent expansion and position. Stent migration was noted in 3 lesions. When stent expansion was optimized, pts received no anticoagulation and either aspirin 325 mg/day or Ticlopidine 500 mg/day for 1 month with aspirin 325 mg for 5 days. 13 patients (87 %) were treated without anticoagulation after stent deployment.
