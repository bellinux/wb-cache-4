5|$|Assuming {{command of}} United States Central Command in 1988, Schwarzkopf was {{called on to}} respond to the Invasion of Kuwait in 1990 by the forces of Iraq <b>under</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein. Initially tasked with {{defending}} Saudi Arabia from Iraqi aggression, Schwarzkopf's command eventually grew to an international force of over 750,000 troops. After diplomatic relations broke down, he planned and led Operation Desert Storm—an extended air campaign followed by a highly successful 100-hour ground offensive—which defeated the Iraqi Army and liberated Kuwait in early 1991. Schwarzkopf was presented with military honors.|$|E
5|$|In late 1990 after Iraqi forces <b>under</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein invaded and {{occupied}} Kuwait, ultimately {{leading to the}} Gulf War, American commentators and Middle East experts {{expressed concern about the}} possible consequences of the Arab street in the region rising up in support of Saddam against their own governments, many of whom (particularly Egypt) had joined the military coalition led by the United States. This did not happen when the actual war began, nor for the hundred days of combat before Iraqi forces retreated and surrendered. A year later, in 1992, David Pollock of the United States Information Agency (USIA) wrote a lengthy paper arguing that those commentators had seriously misunderstood the Arab street and, by extension, all Arab public opinion.|$|E
25|$|<b>Under</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein's regime, 1968 to 2003, in Iraq, Shia Muslims {{were heavily}} arrested, {{tortured}} and killed.|$|E
50|$|Despite having {{mobile phones}} {{in the middle}} east since 1995, Iraqis were only able to use mobile phones after 2003. Mobile phones were banned <b>under</b> <b>Saddam's</b> rule.Currently upwards to 78% of Iraqis own a mobile phone.|$|R
5000|$|On July 2, 2006, Iraq {{national}} security advisor Muwaffaq al-Rubaie announced that Sajida and her daughter Raghad are placed 16th and 17th on the Iraqi government's most wanted list for financing Sunni Muslim insurgents <b>under</b> <b>Saddam's</b> reign.|$|R
50|$|Arba'een's {{performance}} has been banned in some periods, {{the last of}} which was when Saddam Hussein, was president of Iraq. For nearly 30 years <b>under</b> <b>Saddam's</b> regime, it was forbidden to mark Arba'een publicly in Iraq. Following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the observance in April 2003 was broadcast worldwide.|$|R
25|$|Between 16–17 March 1988, the Iraqi {{government}} <b>under</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein {{carried out}} a poison gas attack in the Kurdish town of Halabja in Iraqi Kurdistan. Between 3,200 and 5,000 civilians died instantly, and between 7,000 and 10,000 civilians were injured, and thousands more would die in the following years from complications, diseases, and birth defects caused by the attack.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{situation}} in Iraqi Kurdistan (the three northern governorates with primarily Kurdish populations) is quite different. Due to their better stability, the Kurdish semi-autonomous area enjoys health care superior to that <b>under</b> <b>Saddam.</b> Health workers have not left the provinces for Syria or Jordan, {{as they have in}} sectarian Iraq, and new programs for continuing professional education in major Iraqi Kurdish cities reflect the optimism of the area.|$|E
25|$|The Ba'athist {{government}} of Iraq forcibly displaced and culturally Arabized minorities (Kurds, Yezidis, Assyrians, Shabaks, Armenians, Turkmen, Mandeans), {{in line with}} settler colonialist policies, from the 1960s to the early 2000s, in order to shift the demographics of North Iraq towards Arab domination. The Baath party <b>under</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein engaged in active expulsion of minorities from the mid-1970s onwards. In 1978 and 1979, 600 Kurdish villages were burned down and around 200,000 Kurds were deported to {{the other parts of}} the country.|$|E
25|$|Points of {{interest}} include the National Museum of Iraq whose priceless collection of artifacts was looted during the 2003 invasion, and the iconic Hands of Victory arches. Multiple Iraqi parties are in discussions {{as to whether}} the arches should remain as historical monuments or be dismantled. Thousands of ancient manuscripts in the National Library were destroyed <b>under</b> <b>Saddam's</b> command.|$|R
25|$|Due to {{the current}} demand for these battalions to become active as soon as possible, the first four battalions' officers, non-commissioned officers, and enlisted men are being trained {{simultaneously}} (in separate groups). Notable differences in training between CAATT and former training <b>under</b> <b>Saddam's</b> regime include schooling in human rights, the laws of land warfare, and tolerance in a multi-ethnic team.|$|R

25|$|Al-Douri was {{a senior}} member of the Ba'athist {{government}} <b>under</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein. This was due to the fact that both al-Douri and Hussein came from the same Tikriti tribal background. When the Ba'athists seized power in 1968, he was made interior minister where he oversaw efforts to sideline political rivals to the Ba'ath Party, mainly the Iraqi Communist Party. Al-Douri became the vice chairman of the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council prior to 2003, giving him unprecedented amounts of power and influence within the Iraqi political sphere.|$|E
25|$|Ba'athist Arabization {{campaigns in}} North Iraq were forced {{displacement}} and cultural Arabization of minorities (Kurds, Yezidis, Assyrians, Shabaks, Armenians, Turkmen, Mandeans), {{in line with}} settler colonialist policies, led by the Ba'athist government of Iraq from 1960s to early 2000s, in order to shift the demographics of North Iraq towards Arab domination. The Baath party <b>under</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein engaged into active expulsion of minorities from the mid-1970s onwards. The campaigns {{took place during the}} Iraqi–Kurdish conflict, being largely motivated by the Kurdish-Arab ethnic and political conflict.|$|E
25|$|The {{first trial}} began before the Iraqi Special Tribunal on 19 October 2005. At this trial Saddam and seven other {{defendants}} were tried for {{crimes against humanity}} with regard to events that took place after a failed assassination attempt in Dujail in 1982 {{by members of the}} Islamic Dawa Party (see also human rights abuses in Iraq <b>under</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein). A second and separate trial began on 21 August 2006, trying Saddam and six co-defendants for genocide during the Anfal military campaign against the Kurds of northern Iraq.|$|E
25|$|During {{the years}} of Saddam Hussein's rule of Iraq through the Ba'ath Party, Sistani was {{untouched}} during the violent Ba'athist repression and persecution that killed many clerics including Mohammad Mohammad Sadeq al-Sadr in 1999, for which Saddam denied any involvement. His predecessor, Khoei, sat down with Saddam on state TV. After the death of Grand Ayatollah Khoei in 1992, Sistani emerged as the prominent Shia cleric to guide the Shia people <b>under</b> <b>Saddam's</b> rule, although Sistani's mosque was shut down in 1994 and did not reopen until the US-led 2003 invasion of Iraq.|$|R

25|$|Due to {{the devastation}} of the campaigns of the Iraqi army <b>under</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein and other former Iraqi regimes, the Kurdistan Region's {{infrastructure}} {{was never able to}} modernize. After the 1991 safe haven was established, the Kurdistan Regional Government began projects to reconstruct the Kurdistan Region. Since then, of all the 4,500 villages that were destroyed by Saddam Husseins' regime, 65% have been reconstructed by the KRG. Furthermore, since the removal of the previous regime in 2003, the KRG has been able to scale up its service delivery and infrastructure, which has changed the economic landscape of the region and facilitated a number of investment projects.|$|E
25|$|The Shia {{suffered}} indirect {{and direct}} persecution under post-colonial Iraqi governments since 1932, erupting into full-scale rebellions in 1935 and 1936. Shias were also persecuted during the Ba'ath Party rule, especially <b>under</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein. It {{is said that}} every Shia clerical family of note in Iraq had tales of torture and murder to recount. In 1969 the son of Iraq's highest Shia Ayatollah Muhsin al-Hakim was arrested and allegedly tortured. From 1979–1983 Saddam's regime executed 48 major Shia clerics in Iraq. They included Shia leader Mohammad Baqir al-Sadr and his sister. Tens of thousands of Iranians and Arabs of Iranian origin were expelled in 1979 and 1980 and a further 75,000 in 1989.|$|E
25|$|On 17 September 1980, {{after the}} Islamic Revolution in Iran settled down, Iraq <b>under</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein {{declared}} the previous settlement of border disputes with Iran null and void. Several days later on 22 September, Iraq invaded Iran in the Iran–Iraq War. Lasting until 1988, the brutal war killed {{over one million}} people and critically soured Arab–Iranian relations. The Iranian government officially viewed the conflict not as Arab vs. Iranian but from a religious perspective of Shia versus Sunni, although many in Iran did view the conflict as an Arab versus Iran issue. In Iraq, the conflict was continually presented in a historical context as Arab versus Persian. The impact {{of the war was}} devastating to relations in the region; general Arab support for Iraq and a fear of Shia Muslims led to many disputes between Iran and the other Persian Gulf states. The war was a primary cause for the rise of anti-Arabism within Iran, which had until then been largely insignificant. The war ended with a UN-sponsored cease-fire.|$|E
50|$|Sa'dun Hammadi (22 June 1930 - 14 March 2007; سعدون حمادي) {{was briefly}} Prime Minister of Iraq <b>under</b> President <b>Saddam</b> Hussein from March until September 1991. He succeeded Hussein, who had {{previously}} been prime minister {{in addition to being}} president, but was forced out due to his reformist views.|$|R
50|$|The 9/11 Commission {{stated in}} its report that bin Laden had been {{sponsoring}} anti-Saddam Islamists in Iraqi Kurdistan, and sought to attract them into his Islamic army. Those forces mostly operated in areas not <b>under</b> <b>Saddam's</b> control. Sudanese Islamic leader Hassan al-Turabi, to protect his ties with Iraq, brokered an agreement with Bin Laden to stop supporting activities against Saddam. Bin Laden seemed to honor this agreement for a time, although, he continued to aid Islamic extremists in Kurdistan. In the late 1990s, these extremist groups suffered major defeats by Kurdish forces. In 2001, the extremist groups, with help from Bin Laden, re-formed into an organization called Ansar al-Islam. There are indications that by then the Iraqi regime tolerated and may even have helped Ansar al Islam against the common Kurdish enemy.|$|R

50|$|In 1971, Iraq (now <b>under</b> <b>Saddam's</b> {{effective}} rule) broke {{diplomatic relations}} with Iran after claiming sovereignty rights over the islands of Abu Musa, Greater and Lesser Tunbs in the Persian Gulf following {{the withdrawal of the}} British. As retaliation for Iraq's claims to Khuzestan, Iran became the main patron of Iraq's Kurdish rebels in the early 1970s, giving the Iraqi Kurds bases in Iran and arming the Kurdish groups. In addition to Iraq fomenting separatism in Iran's Khuzestan and Balochistan, both states encouraged separatist activities by Kurdish nationalists in the other state. From March 1974 to March 1975, Iran and Iraq fought border wars over Iran's support of Iraqi Kurds. In 1975, the Iraqis launched an offensive into Iran using tanks, though the Iranians defeated them. Several other attacks took place; however, Iran had the world's fifth most powerful military at the time and easily defeated the Iraqis with its air force. As a result, Iraq decided against continuing the war, choosing instead to make concessions to Tehran to end the Kurdish rebellion.|$|R
