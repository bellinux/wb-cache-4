5|$|Female orangutans have eight-year {{intervals}} between births, {{the longest}} interbirth intervals among the great apes. <b>Unlike</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> primates, male orangutans {{do not seem}} to practice infanticide. This may be because they cannot ensure they will sire a female's next offspring because she does not immediately begin ovulating again after her infant dies.|$|E
5|$|Men's {{football}} {{has been}} included in every Summer Olympic Games except 1896 and 1932. <b>Unlike</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> sports, the men's football tournament at the Olympics is not a top-level tournament, and since 1992, an under-23 tournament with each team allowed three over-age players. Women's football made its Olympic debut in 1996.|$|E

5|$|The {{hardness}} of diamond {{contributes to}} its suitability as a gemstone. Because {{it can only}} be scratched by other diamonds, it maintains its polish extremely well. <b>Unlike</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> gems, it is well-suited to daily wear because of its resistance to scratching—perhaps contributing to its popularity as the preferred gem in engagement or wedding rings, which are often worn every day.|$|E
5|$|<b>Unlike</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> oceanic islands, Inaccessible Island has {{remained}} free from introduced predators, allowing this species to flourish while many other flightless birds, particularly flightless rails, have gone extinct. The species is nevertheless considered vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), {{due to its}} single small population, which would be threatened by the accidental introduction of mammalian predators such as rats or cats.|$|E
5|$|In a {{game against}} the Atlanta Thrashers on December 10, 2003, Miller injured his neck. It would lead him to miss most of the 2003–04 season, {{appearing}} in 35 games and scoring one goal and two assists. The 2004–05 NHL lockout resulted in a cancelled 2004–05 season. <b>Unlike</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> players, Miller did not play in a different league. He returned to play for the 2005–06 season and earned eight assists in 56 games.

According to film professors such as Jamsheed Akrami, <b>unlike</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> contemporary filmmakers Kiarostami has consistently attempted to redefine film by forcing the audience's increased involvement. In recent {{years he has}} also progressively trimmed down {{the size of his}} films, which Akrami believes reduces the film making experience from a collective endeavor to a purer, more basic form of artistic expression.|$|E
5|$|Little {{more than}} a year after her birth, Maria Theresa was joined by a sister, Maria Anna, and another one, named Maria Amalia, was born in 1724. The portraits of the {{imperial}} family show that Maria Theresa resembled Elisabeth Christine and Maria Anna. The Prussian ambassador noted that she had large blue eyes, fair hair with a slight tinge of red, a wide mouth and a notably strong body. <b>Unlike</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> members of the House of Habsburg, neither Maria Theresa's parents nor her grandparents were closely related to each other.|$|E
5|$|Mloukhiyeh is a stew {{made from}} Corchorus. The Corchorus is picked during harvest time, and is either frozen or dried. It is widely {{popular in the}} middle east, as it is {{commonly}} grown in dry climate areas. The stew is cooked with lemon juice and water, and served with cut lemons and rice. The meal can be served with either chicken or lamb however it can be served without either (<b>unlike</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> Palestinian meals).|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the early}} volumes were written by Canadian Leslie McFarlane, who {{authored}} nineteen of the first twenty-five titles and co-authored volume 17 The Secret Warning, between 1927 and 1946. <b>Unlike</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> Syndicate ghostwriters, McFarlane was regarded highly enough by the Syndicate that he was frequently given advances of $25 or $50, and during the Depression, when fees were lowered, he was paid $85 for each Hardy Boys book when other Syndicate ghostwriters were receiving only $75 for their productions. According to McFarlane's family, he despised the series and its characters.|$|E
5|$|The notability {{of there}} being four captains in just five Test matches can better be {{understood}} with context. The captain of a cricket team performs a vital role. <b>Unlike</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> team sports, the captain makes crucial decisions regarding on-field tactics, {{and may also}} have an important say in team selection. Traditionally, captains of international teams are not changed frequently – for example, between 1977 and 1988 (comprising 104 Test matches), only seven different men captained England, yet there were four captains {{in just a few}} weeks in the summer of 1988.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Medieval period, Shrewsbury was a centre for {{the wool}} trade, and used its {{position}} on the River Severn to transport goods across England via the canal system. <b>Unlike</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> towns in this period, Shrewsbury never became a centre for heavy industry. By the early 1900s, the town became focused on transport services and the general service and professional sector, owing to {{its position on}} the A5 road, part of the strategic route to North Wales.|$|E

5|$|<b>Unlike</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> hadrosaurids, Edmontosaurus {{lacked a}} bony crest. It {{may have had}} soft-tissue display {{structures}} in the skull, though: the bones around the nasal openings had deep indentations surrounding the openings, and this pair of recesses are postulated to have held inflatable air sacs, perhaps allowing for both visual and auditory signaling. Edmontosaurus may have been dimorphic, with more robust and more lightly built forms, {{but it has not}} been established if this is related to sexual dimorphism.|$|E
5|$|Bears {{have small}} rounded ears {{so as to}} {{minimise}} heat loss, but neither their hearing or sight are particularly acute. <b>Unlike</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> carnivorans they have colour vision, perhaps to help them distinguish ripe nuts and fruits. They are unique among carnivorans in not having touch-sensitive whiskers on the muzzle; however, they have an excellent sense of smell, better {{than that of the}} dog, or possibly any other mammal. They use smell for signalling to each other (either to warn off rivals or detect mates) and for finding food. Smell is the principal sense used by bears to locate most of their food, and they have excellent memories which helps them to relocate places where they have found food before.|$|E
5|$|Brood parasites {{occur in}} several bee {{families}} including the apid subfamily Nomadinae. Females of these bees lack pollen collecting structures (the scopa) {{and do not}} construct their own nests. They typically enter the nests of pollen collecting species, and lay their eggs in cells provisioned by the host bee. When the cuckoo bee larva hatches it consumes the host larva's pollen ball, and often the host egg also. The Arctic bee species, Bombus hyperboreus, in particular are an aggressive species that attack and enslave other bees of the same subgenus. However, <b>unlike</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> bee brood parasites, they have pollen baskets and often collect pollen.|$|E

5|$|During the 15th {{century the}} economy of Southampton {{improved}} {{as a result of}} the Italian wool trade and the presence of many foreign merchants. The Medieval Merchant's House was acquired by a sequence of established Southampton merchants, but it remained intact as a detached dwelling, <b>unlike</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> properties in the neighbourhood that were combined to form the larger homes that became more fashionable in the late 15th century. In the middle of the 16th century, however, Southampton's economy collapsed once again as trade with Italy declined, taking with it the prosperity of FrenchStreet. A new parlour was installed in the house, and a floor was added halfway across the open hall to produce additional sleeping space.|$|E
5|$|Giant mouse lemurs begin {{foraging}} {{moments before}} the sun disappears, occasionally participate in social activities during {{the last half of}} the night, and return to one of their nests prior to sunrise. Cold temperatures cause them to leave the nest later and return early, sometime during the second half of the night. During the first half of the night, giant mouse lemurs are more likely to rest for an hour or more, usually at the expense of social activities, but not feeding time. Rest periods are longer when temperatures are low. <b>Unlike</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> cheirogaleids, they remain active all year and do not enter daily or seasonal torpor.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{abundant}} stingrays inhabiting Indo-Pacific reefs, the bluespotted ribbontail ray generally spends the day hidden alone inside caves or under coral ledges or other debris (including from shipwrecks), often with only its tail showing. At night, small groups assemble and swim onto shallow sandy flats with the rising tide to feed. <b>Unlike</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> stingrays, this species seldom buries itself in sand. The bluespotted ribbontail ray excavates sand pits in search of molluscs, polychaete worms, shrimps, crabs, and small benthic bony fishes; when prey is located, it is trapped by {{the body of the}} ray and maneuvered into the mouth with the disc. Other fishes, such as goatfish, frequently follow foraging rays, seeking food missed by the ray.|$|E
