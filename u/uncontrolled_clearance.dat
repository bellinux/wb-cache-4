50|$|The {{intense and}} {{long-lasting}} civil war has caused immense damage to this environment, leaving the forests exposed to poaching and <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>clearance,</b> and conservation has obviously become a low priority {{issue for the}} government. Also due to this conflict the area cannot be properly studied by scientists. However the woodland is not threatened by clearance for agriculture or logging as along {{with the effects of}} war there are other factors keeping the population of the region to a minimum; the sandy soil does not sustain agriculture, and the woods and grassland are rife with tsetse fly. Some forest is being cleared on the edge of towns or for strip-mining.|$|E
40|$|In {{hematological}} malignancies {{complex interactions}} {{exist between the}} immune system, microorganisms and malignant cells. On one hand, microorganisms can induce cancer, as illustrated by specific infection-induced lymphoproliferative diseases such as Helicobacter pylori-associated gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. On the other hand, malignant cells create an immunosuppressive environment for their own benefit, but this also results in {{an increased risk of}} infections. Disrupted innate immunity contributes to the neoplastic transformation of blood cells by several mechanisms, including the <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>clearance</b> of microbial and autoantigens resulting in chronic immune stimulation and proliferation, chronic inflammation, and defective immune surveillance and anti-cancer immunity. Restoring dysfunction or enhancing responsiveness of the innate immune system might therefore represent a new angle for the prevention and treatment of hematological malignancies, in particular lymphoid malignancies and associated infections. Recently, {{it has been shown that}} cells of the innate immune system, such as monocytes/macrophages and natural killer cells, harbor features of immunological memory and display enhanced functionality long-term after stimulation with certain microorganisms and vaccines. These functional changes rely on epigenetic reprogramming and have been termed 'trained immunity'. In this review the concept of 'trained immunity' is discussed in the setting of lymphoid malignancies. Amelioration of infectious complications and hematological disease progression can be envisioned to result from the induction of trained immunity, but future studies are required to prove this exciting new hypothesi...|$|E

40|$|The {{diagnosis}} {{of the state and}} quality of the environment in the hydrographical basin of Bistriţa Ardeleană. The evaluation of the state and quality of the environment represents an unavoidable undertaking inside the strategic land management process. The defining of the major water, air and soil pollution sources doubled by the {{diagnosis of}} the qualities of the environmental factors form an explicit framework over the real perspective of sustainable development of the investigated territory. The pollution, the efficient monitoring of the quality indicators of the environmental factors, alongside the effective measures towards the remedy of the signalled malefactions constitute the threesome point of view on the environmental issue. The hydrographical basin of Bistriţa Ardeleană brings together activities that can inflict inequities {{from the point of view}} of the environmental quality, especially in the urban area. Inside the rural area occasionally come to convert industrial activities, the main problems issued here being the defective management of the landfill waste, the <b>uncontrolled</b> wood <b>clearance,</b> the lack of any network of rural waste water collection. An inventory of the main problem category, seconded by the shaping of the main action measures, constitutes the essence of this endeavour...|$|R
