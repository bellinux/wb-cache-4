40|$|A multi-element airfoil system {{includes}} an airfoil element having {{a leading edge}} region and a skin element coupled to the airfoil element. A slat deployment system is coupled to the slat and the skin element, and is capable of deploying and retracting the slat and the skin element. The skin element substantially fills the lateral gap formed between the slat and the airfoil element when the slat is deployed. The system further {{includes an}} <b>uncoupling</b> <b>device</b> and a sensor to remove the skin element from the gap based on a critical angle-of-attack of the airfoil element. The system can alternatively comprise a trailing edge flap, where a skin element substantially fills the lateral gap between the flap and the trailing edge region of the airfoil element. In each case, the skin element fills {{a gap between the}} airfoil element and the deployed flap or slat to reduce airframe noise...|$|E
40|$|Polarisation {{effects in}} the {{microcavity}} parametric oscillator are studied using a simple model in which two chi-three optical parametric oscillators are coupled together. It is found that there are, in general, a number of steady states of the model under continuous pumping. There are both continuous and discontinuous thresholds, at which new steady-states appear as the driving intensity is increased: at the continuous thresholds, the new state has zero output intensity, whereas at the discontinuous threshold it has a finite output intensity. The discontinuous thresholds have no analog in the <b>uncoupled</b> <b>device.</b> The coupling also generates rotations of the linear polarisation of the output compared with the pump, and shifts in the output frequencies as the driving polarisation or intensity is varied. For large ratios {{of the interaction between}} polarisations to the interaction within polarisations, of the order of 5, one of the thresholds has its lowest value when the pump is elliptically polarised. This is consistent with recent experiments in which the maximum output was achieved with an elliptically polarised pump. Comment: 7 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract â€“ T/ 2 soft DFE {{is based}} on idea of {{transforming}} a classical DFE to a cascade of <b>uncoupled</b> linear <b>devices.</b> The crucial component of this cascade is a white filter, which supplies the linear T/ 2 FSE with uncorrelated samples. The adaptive whiting of input sequence is controlled by a stochastic gradient algorithm based on Joint Entropy Maximization (JEM-W) criteria which introduces soft decision properties {{at the very beginning}} of blind equalization. Soft decisions probably smooth the error surface and allow the algorithm to escape from local minima...|$|R
40|$|We extend in {{this paper}} some {{previous}} results concerning the differential-algebraic index of hybrid models of electrical and electronic circuits. Specifically, we present a comprehensive index characterization which holds without passivity requirements, in contrast to previous approaches, and which applies to nonlinear circuits composed of <b>uncoupled,</b> one-port <b>devices.</b> The index conditions, which are {{stated in terms of}} the forest structure of certain digraph minors, do not depend on the specific tree chosen in the formulation of the hybrid equations. Additionally, we show how to include memristors in hybrid circuit models; in this direction, we extend the index analysis to circuits including active memristors, which have been recently used in the design of nonlinear oscillators and chaotic circuits. We also discuss the extension of these results to circuits with controlled sources, making our framework of interest in the analysis of circuits with transistors, amplifiers, and other multiterminal devices...|$|R
