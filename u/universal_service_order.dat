50|$|The {{service order}} process {{utilizes}} the USOC, USO and Field Identifiers (FIDs), to provision, bill and maintain services and equipment. <b>Universal</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Order</b> or USO Codes {{are used by}} telecommunications service providers to collect and structure all the information needed for service activation, including ordering, provisioning, service assurance and billing. USOC codes, also known as rate elements, are used by telecommunications service providers to identify each billable element of a customer’s service. Field Identifiers or FIDs are used by telecommunications service providers to identify a billing preference or attribute of a customer’s account. FIDs define the technical parameters required to provision and bill a customer’s service beyond those described in USOCs.|$|E
50|$|Registered jacks {{replaced}} {{the use of}} protective couplers provided exclusively by the telephone company. The new modular connectors were much smaller and cheaper to produce than the earlier, bulkier connectors {{that were used in}} the Bell System since the 1930s. The Bell System issued specifications for the modular connectors and their wiring as <b>Universal</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Order</b> Codes (USOC), which were the only standards at the time. USOCs are commonly specified to the communications provider by large businesses for a variety of services. Because there are many standardized interface options available to the customer, the customer must specify the type of interface required by RJ/USOC. For a multi-line interface such as the RJ21 (which provided 25 pairs), the customer must denote which position(s) of the interface are to be used. If there are multiple RJ21 connectors, they are numbered sequentially and the customer must advise the communications provider of which one to use.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess the degree to which {{auctioning}} the right to provide <b>universal</b> <b>service</b> is a viable option in developed countries with high teledensity and near ubiquitous fixed line and mobile networks. The paper also aims to provide signposts on the types of issues regulators need to consider and resolve when designing auctioning mechanisms for the competitive provision of <b>universal</b> <b>service.</b> Design/methodology/approach: The paper examines the nature and scope of <b>universal</b> <b>service,</b> the approaches that have been used to identify the costs of <b>universal</b> <b>service</b> provision and the difficulties in using an auction process to allocate the right to provide <b>universal</b> <b>service</b> in countries with near ubiquitous network infrastructure. Australia is used as a case study on the difficulties of using auctions to encourage new entry in <b>universal</b> <b>service</b> areas served by a powerful incumbent. The paper also examines the types of issues regulators need to resolve when designing auction mechanisms for <b>universal</b> <b>service</b> provision. Findings: The paper concludes that for developed countries, it is unclear whether the use of auctions for the provision of <b>universal</b> <b>service</b> will have the desired effect of ensuring a market-based approach to service provision. This is because the risks associated with becoming an alternative <b>universal</b> <b>service</b> provider are likely to outweigh the benefits of doing so. Further, the risks faced by an alternative <b>universal</b> <b>service</b> provider are not borne by the incumbent operator thus further increasing the disincentive to bid for the right to provide <b>universal</b> <b>service.</b> The paper also concludes that the practical design of the <b>universal</b> <b>service</b> rights and obligations which will be attached to a winning bidder's license conditions is an extremely important mechanism by which some of the risks to potential <b>universal</b> <b>service</b> providers can be overcome. Originality/value: The paper stimulates thinking about whether <b>universal</b> <b>service</b> auctions are a viable means of providing <b>universal</b> <b>service</b> in developed countries. In presenting empirical evidence of the difficulties in using auctions to introduce competition in <b>universal</b> <b>service</b> provision, the paper may provide valuable input to the regulatory proceedings associated with introducing <b>universal</b> <b>service</b> contestability arrangements that are currently being conducted in various countries...|$|R

50|$|There is {{consensus}} that the current <b>universal</b> <b>service</b> and intercarrier compensation mechanisms need to be modified to accommodate the new market conditions. For example, the current <b>universal</b> <b>service</b> funding mechanism is assessed only on telecommunications services, and carriers can receive <b>universal</b> <b>service</b> funding only in support of telecommunications services. Thus, if services that had been classified as telecommunications services are re-classified as information services, as recently occurred for high-speed digital subscriber line (“DSL”) <b>services,</b> then the <b>universal</b> <b>service</b> assessment base will decline and carriers that depend on <b>universal</b> <b>service</b> funding may see a decline in support. It therefore may be timely to consider whether the scope of <b>universal</b> <b>service</b> should be expanded to include universal access to a broadband network at affordable rates, not just to basic telephone service.|$|R

40|$|The {{financing}} of <b>universal</b> <b>service</b> {{provision in the}} postal sector has traditionally relied on granting the <b>universal</b> <b>service</b> provider a reserved area. Together with growing electronic substitution, current liberalization policies promoting competitive entry may put the traditional <b>universal</b> <b>service</b> at risk. Hence, there is an increased interest in knowing the cost of <b>universal</b> <b>service</b> provision. The third EC postal directive proposes a calculation approach to separately determine the net cost of a <b>universal</b> <b>service</b> obligation and to compensate the <b>universal</b> <b>service</b> provider (USP). This paper discusses the interaction between <b>universal</b> <b>service</b> costing and financing and shows that the EC approach may result in distorted results. It also quantifies the effects based on a model calibration with Swiss data. The results show that separate costing and financing leads to a considerable under-compensation of the USP {{if there is a}} compensation fund to which every operator contributes. The USP is over-compensated if it is exempt from contributing to the fund (pay or play mechanism). The problem of under- or overcompensation can be resolved by an integrated computation of the net cost that includes the competitive effects of the financing mechanism. Such an integrated approach results in a fair compensation of the USP. Regulation, Post, <b>Universal</b> <b>service</b> obligation, Financing...|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins ""Universal service" means providing residential customers with affordable, nationwide access to basic phone service. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 extended support for <b>universal</b> <b>service</b> to eligible schools, libraries, and rural health care providers. <b>Universal</b> <b>service</b> programs are generally funded by mandatory contributions from telecommunications companies. New technologies, however, are putting this funding source in jeopardy. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has issued many orders designed to implement the act's <b>universal</b> <b>service</b> reforms. The <b>Universal</b> <b>Service</b> Administration Company runs the day-to-day operations of federal <b>universal</b> <b>service</b> programs on FCC's behalf, although FCC retains responsibility for oversight and ensuring compliance with its rules. At the state level, public utility commissions generally regulate rates for local and long-distance phone <b>service</b> and implement <b>universal</b> <b>service</b> programs. Public utility commissions subsidize local phone service from the rates set for urban and business phone service and for "vertical" services, such as caller ID and call waiting. Although the use of digital technologies and internet protocol networks for communications has risen rapidly during the past decade, the providers of these services {{are not required to}} contribute to the <b>universal</b> <b>service</b> fund. As these new voice services gain in popularity, funding for <b>universal</b> <b>service</b> may begin to decline.
