5|$|Leifthrasir {{reached the}} top of sales charts, {{claiming}} the spot Monster Hunter Generations which had held the position for three weeks on end. Sales were strong compared to the original version: selling 43,394 <b>units</b> <b>on</b> PlayStation Vita at #1, 42,263 <b>units</b> <b>on</b> PlayStation 4 at #2, and 9,771 <b>units</b> <b>on</b> PlayStation 3 at #10.

Upon release in Western territories, the Vita version reached #2 on the PSN chart.|$|E
5|$|According to Brian Fallow, the New Zealand Herald Economics editor, {{business}} lobby {{groups such}} as Business New Zealand and the Greenhouse Policy Coalition (representing the energy intensive sector) welcomed {{the introduction of a}} temporary price cap and the principle of basing free allocations of <b>units</b> <b>on</b> the basis of intensity of production.|$|E

5|$|At this time, the ADF had no {{military}} <b>units</b> <b>on</b> operational deployment outside Australia. In 1987, the ADF {{made its first}} operational deployment as part of Operation Morris Dance, in which several warships and a rifle company deployed to the waters off Fiji {{in response to the}} 1987 Fijian coups d'état. While broadly successful, this deployment highlighted the need for the ADF to improve its capability to rapidly respond to unforeseen events.|$|E
5|$|Before the game's release, {{industry}} analyst Michael Pachter estimated that Halo Wars would sell 2 million <b>units.</b> <b>On</b> March 19, 2009, Microsoft {{announced that the}} game had sold 1 million units and that players had spent 118 total years of time in online skirmish matches. According to NPD Group's March sales figures, Halo Wars sold 639,000 copies in the U.S. through March, making it the third best-selling game in the market.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy V {{has sold}} 2.45million <b>units</b> <b>on</b> the Super Famicom (including 2million copies {{during its first}} two months of release), while the Japanese Game Boy Advance version has sold nearly 260,000copies as of December 2007.

5|$|In April 1943, Slim {{requested}} that the 70th Division be released from Eastern Army reserve to relieve other <b>units</b> <b>on</b> the Arakan front, but elements of the division were only slowly redeployed. The 23rd Infantry Brigade arrived in the Arakan area in May. As of June, {{the remainder of the}} division was still part of the army reserve.|$|E
5|$|On 2 November 1914 McNeile {{travelled}} to France {{as part of}} the British Expeditionary Force. Few {{details are}} known about McNeile's wartime service, as his records were destroyed by incendiary bombs during the Second World War. He spent time with a number of Royal Engineer <b>units</b> <b>on</b> the Western Front, including 1st Field Squadron RE, 15th Field Company RE and RE elements of the 33rd Division.|$|E
5|$|On the Roman side, Ammianus attests one vexillatio of equites sagittarii (mounted archers) at Strasbourg. It is {{also likely}} {{that at least one}} {{regiment}} of foot archers took part, probably an auxilium of sagittarii (archers). There were thus probably about 1,000 archers in dedicated <b>units</b> <b>on</b> the Roman side. In addition, a number of ordinary infantry units probably included archers.|$|E

Following the inactivation of the 67th Fighter Wing in November 1950, the wing {{was put in}} charge of a few fighter <b>units</b> <b>on</b> the Atlantic Coast. In 1976, the wing even became responsible for the 147th Fighter Interceptor Group, located in Texas.|$|E
5|$|Passenger trains connect from Suvalki, Hrodno and Lithuania to Warsaw and {{the rest}} of the European {{passenger}} network. Passenger services are provided by two rail service providers, PKP Intercity that provides intercity passengers trains (express, intercity, eurocity, hotel and TLK) and Przewozy Regionalne that operates only regional passenger trains financed by the voivodeship. Passenger trains are mostly run using electrical multiple <b>units</b> (<b>on</b> electrified lines) or rail buses.|$|E
5|$|The National Flag of Portugal {{also serves}} as war flag and ensign, so being flown on {{military}} facilities and naval ships. There are however specific national military flags for specific uses, namely the military colors, the naval jack and the naval pennant. The military colors are occasionally referred as war flag, however they {{are not to be}} flown on military facilities but are only to be carried by the military <b>units</b> <b>on</b> parades.|$|E

5|$|The {{historical}} {{representation of}} Charlie Company's actions, led by its commander, Captain Ralph E. Goranson, was well maintained {{in the opening}} sequence. The sequence and details of the events {{are very close to}} the historical record, including the sea sickness experienced by many of the soldiers as the landing craft moved toward the shoreline, significant casualties among the men as they disembarked from the boats, and difficulty linking up with adjacent <b>units</b> <b>on</b> the shore.|$|E
5|$|A recent {{development}} {{is the use of}} the RDS system of car radios. The ambulance is fitted with a short range FM transmitter, set to RDS code 31, which interrupts the radio of all cars within range, {{in the manner of a}} traffic broadcast, but in such a way that the user of the receiving radio is unable to opt out of the message (as with traffic broadcasts). This feature is built into every RDS radio for use in national emergency broadcast systems, but short range <b>units</b> <b>on</b> emergency vehicles can prove an effective means of alerting traffic to their presence. It is, however, unlikely that this system could replace audible warnings, as it is unable to alert pedestrians, those not using a compatible radio or even have it turned off.|$|E
5|$|All {{functions}} can {{be invoked}} by the mouse. Keys can also invoke the game setup, {{some of the}} menu options and some gameplay functions including scrolling and pausing the game. Players can select single units by clicking, and groups of up to four by shift-clicking or bandboxing. To move units, players can shift the mouse to select <b>units</b> <b>on</b> the main map, move to the unit menu to select an action, {{and then back to}} the main map or minimap to specify the target area; but shortcut keys can eliminate the middle mouse action in this cycle.|$|E

5|$|Allied {{aircraft}} specifically started targeting ZNDH and Luftwaffe {{bases and}} aircraft {{for the first}} time as a result of the Seventh anti-Partisan Offensive, including Operation Rösselsprung in late May 1944. Until then Axis aircraft could fly inland almost at will as long as they remained at low altitude. Partisan <b>units</b> <b>on</b> the ground frequently complained about enemy aircraft attacking them while hundreds of Allied aircraft flew above at higher altitude. This changed during Rösselsprung as Allied fighter-bombers went low en-masse {{for the first time}}, establishing full aerial superiority. Consequently, both the ZNDH and Luftwaffe were forced to limit their operations in clear weather to early morning and late afternoon hours.|$|E
5|$|As {{damage is}} dealt by units within the CO zone, the CO's power meter fills slightly, {{at a rate}} of one bar per five hit points worth of damage inflicted. As the CO power meter is filled, the CO zone grows larger. When the meter is full, the CO can {{activate}} his power which has an effect on the whole battlefield, such as repairing allied units, damaging enemy units, or temporarily altering weather conditions. In addition, the offensive and defensive boosts that normally apply only in the CO zone, also applies to all allied <b>units</b> <b>on</b> the whole battlefield for the turn that the CO power is active. If the CO unit is destroyed, the CO meter empties and the CO returns to the HQ, able to be redeployed with another unit.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{conductors}} {{and engineers}} often {{knew where the}} locals lived or were headed, trains would make non-scheduled stops to disembark passengers to allow them a shorter walk. In the 1960s, the number of round trips was reduced to three per day, allowing the whole service to be operated with a single unit. NSB used steam power for freight trains until 1970, when NSB's last scheduled steam locomotive service hauled a gravel train from Svene to Kongsberg. For a short period during the 1980s, there were also school trains, but as this forced NSB to operate two multiple <b>units</b> <b>on</b> the line, it proved too expensive and was soon afterwards again provided by bus.|$|E
