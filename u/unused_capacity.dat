25|$|As timber {{is a very}} bulky cargo, it {{required}} many ships to carry it from North America to Britain, {{but there was little}} demand for carrying goods on the return voyages. However, there was a market for carrying migrants, so many of the timber ships turned to the migrant trade to fill their <b>unused</b> <b>capacity.</b> Since timber exports tended to peak {{at the same time as}} conflicts in Europe, a great mass of refugees sought cheap passage across the Atlantic. This created an unprecedented influx of new immigrants in North America.|$|E

2500|$|There was, however, one cargo {{that the}} ship-owners {{did not have}} to worry about finding a market for in the sparsely {{populated}} New World: people. [...] Many of the timber ships turned to carrying immigrants for the return voyage from the British Isles to fill this <b>unused</b> <b>capacity.</b> [...] Timber ships would unload their cargo and sell passage to those desiring to emigrate. During the early nineteenth century, with the preferential tariff in full effect, the timber ships were among the oldest and most dilapidated in the British merchant fleet, and travelling as a passenger upon them was extremely unpleasant and dangerous. It was, however, very cheap. [...] Since timber exports would peak at the same time as conflicts in Europe, such as the Napoleonic Wars, a great mass of refugees sought this cheap passage across the Atlantic.|$|E
30|$|As far as Bosnia and Herzegovina is {{concerned}} (Table  3), {{there is a}} statistical significance in capacity utilization and annual employment growth (p <  0.01), inclined negatively. The decrease in annual employment growth can be explained through lag in permanent fill-time workers because of certain negative political movements {{that happened in the}} past few decades (Nastav and Bojnec 2007; Javorcik and Spatareanu 2011). Capacity utilization is indicator of capital use, and it shows <b>unused</b> <b>capacities,</b> unfortunately. Though, it can also be seen as advantage since there is space for increase in future employment of <b>unused</b> <b>capacities.</b> The constant illustrates that there is strong positive overall effect. When compared movements of gross domestic product and foreign direct investments (Fig.  3), we can notice that these two are closely related and interlinked.|$|R
40|$|We {{estimate}} the debt {{capacity of a}} firm as the critical debt ratio that causes a downgrade in creditworthiness. <b>Unused</b> debt <b>capacities</b> depict the temporal access to external debt funds and measure a firm's financial flexibility. Firms with high <b>unused</b> debt <b>capacities</b> realize a larger fraction of their investment opportunity set, borrow more often, and issue higher volumes of debt. Firms that have exhausted their debt capacity issue equity or pay down debt when having a financial surplus. These patterns of actively using and restoring <b>unused</b> debt <b>capacities</b> imply that preserving financial flexibility is of first-order importance in corporate finance...|$|R

Open-loop flow control is used by ATM in its CBR, VBR and UBR services (see traffic contract and congestion control).|$|R
50|$|Any {{assessment}} {{of the effectiveness of}} a transport network includes a calculation of what capacity is used, how it is used, and whether it is used effectively. For instance, overloaded routes may need to be upgraded, or capacity provided by other routes. <b>Unused</b> <b>capacity</b> can represent an opportunity to move more people or goods: as the capacity exists no additional investment is needed.

40|$|The average U. S. {{firm has}} less {{leverage}} than {{one would expect}} based on the trade-off between tax shields and bankruptcy costs. We focus on firms’ financial flexibility and examine whether firms preserve debt capacity to reduce investment distortions in the future. We find that firms with high <b>unused</b> debt <b>capacity</b> invest more in future years than do firms with low <b>unused</b> debt <b>capacity.</b> Furthermore, firms that are reluctant to borrow in unconstrained periods {{are more likely to}} issue debt in periods in which access to capital markets is more constrained...|$|R

30|$|We {{have found}} strong {{evidence}} for two variables: (1) capacity utilization (based on {{comparison of the}} current output with the maximum output possible using the current inputs by a firm) and (2) annual employment growth (the change in full-time employment reported in {{the current fiscal year}} from a previous period). Both of these two variables give negative results (Table  6) and hence can be claimed with certainly that there is space for improvement of <b>unused</b> <b>capacities</b> of the firms, i.e., they have not yet reached their full potential. On the other hand, annual employment growth is lagging, which is consequence of historical postulates and disorderly politics encompassing this region.|$|R
40|$|Metaheuristic for Flexibility Design Matching {{uncertain}} demand with capacities {{is notoriously}} hard. Operations managers can use mix-flexible resources to shift excess demands to <b>unused</b> <b>capacities.</b> To find the optimal configuration of a mix-flexible production network, a flexibility design problem (FDP) is solved. Existing literature on FDPs provides qualitative structural insights, but work on solution methods is rare. We contribute the first metaheuristic which integrates these structural insights and is specifically tailored to solve FDPs. Our genetic algorithm {{is compared to}} commercial solvers on instances of up to 15 demand types, resources, and 500 demand scenarios. Experimental evidence shows that in the realistic case of flexible optimal configurations, it dominates the comparison methods regarding runtime and solution quality. ...|$|R

A reasonable allocation method could lead to efficient utilizations of existing transmission facilities and, at the same time, provide economic signals for guiding future generation planning and load sitting. In this paper, a comprehensive literature survey is made on available methods of transmission fixed cost allocations. The review is conducted from several different aspects including: costs to be allocated, entities to pay the costs, system states to be based on, cost allocations of <b>unused</b> <b>capacities,</b> pricing of counter flow and that of reactive power, and allocation principles and methods. In addition, the characteristics of each method are analyzed and {{compared with those of}} the others. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a setting of two firms and one capacity agent. Each firm serves a primary market, {{and the capacity}} agent sustains a common market to draw demand for capacity from the external firms. The firms can partner with the capacity agent under her contract to serve the common market. When they use the common market mainly as an outlet for their <b>unused</b> <b>capacities,</b> the capacity agent will only specify a variable fee for each capacity unit deployed through her, and prefer to partner with one firm in most circumstances. When the firms adjust capacities to accommodate the businesses created by serving the common market, the capacity agent will specify a lump-sum payment and a variable fee, and {{will be more likely}} to incentivize only one firm to partner with her, when the common market is sufficiently large or the demands in the common and primary markets are strongly correlated. She will always use a fixed fee to extract, while not necessarily all, the profit gains to the firms serving the common market, but will use a variable fee only when partnering with both firms. The key results are robust with respect to market configuration and contract type. Department of Logistics and Maritime Studie...|$|R
40|$|Pre-print; author's draftServices are {{by nature}} perishable.

This paper advances an alternative perspective of <b>unused</b> service <b>capacity.</b> Based on a review of current literature and an exploratory study, this paper employs a theory-in-use methodology to map out a set of capacity strategy propositions. These propositions show a divergence between what literature suggests and what service firms actually practice with regard to reducing the occurrence of <b>unused</b> service <b>capacity.</b> The paper also demonstrates that capacity can be employed as a resource to achieve a series of strategic objectives that serve to improve the performance of the firm.
