They showed films of the Nashville sit-ins organized in 1960 to end segregation at public lunch counters. [...] Birmingham's black radio station, WENN, supported the new plan by telling students {{to arrive at the}} demonstration meeting place with a toothbrush to be used in jail. Flyers were distributed in black schools and neighborhoods that said, [...] "Fight for freedom first then go to school" [...] and [...] "It's <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> free our teachers, our parents, yourself, and our country." ...|$|E
500|$|Other Formula One drivers {{believed}} that Hamilton had gained an advantage. Sébastien Bourdais of Toro Rosso said that [...] "the penalty is really rough {{but in the}} end it's <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> give the position back or not. Pretty straightforward". The view was reiterated by his fellow drivers Nico Rosberg and Jarno Trulli. Trulli {{believed that}} [...] "Hamilton got an advantage by cutting the chicane", saying, [...] "Had he stayed on the road, he wouldn't have had the speed to overtake the Ferrari. In the same way at Monza someone could cut the first chicane, catch a rival's draft, and overtake him under braking at Roggia".|$|E
500|$|Jeff Nelson from People {{found that}} [...] "Wash All Over Me" [...] {{serves as a}} {{reminder}} that [...] "she's still a person". Nelson went on stating that [...] "it's tracks like the aforementioned 'Wash All Over Me' [...] that showcase the megastar's vulnerable, relatable side". Brad Stern, an editor and publisher for MuuMuse, commented that [...] "Wash All Over Me" [...] was [...] "very Confessions-esque", further calling it [...] "a truly curious concoction of sound". In response to a fan of the singer, Stern agreed that it was [...] "fabulous and very emotional", and opined that [...] "the lyrics are much more intriguing than, say, taking shots of Tanqueray like a girl gone wild." [...] Nouses Jack Elliott applauded [...] "Wash All Over Me", describing it as [...] "a lyrically powerful, yet vulnerable ending to the album that could be interpreted as a track celebrating triumph or defeat. It is <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> interpret it as you wish." ...|$|E

500|$|Metalholic said 'I’m back…” [...] I can’t {{think of}} a more {{appropriate}} way to flow into the second track “Tragic Magic.” [...] Ronnie Radke is most definitely back {{and he is not}} afraid to tell you so.' This fairly slow tempo song obviously takes a few jabs at Radke’s former band Escape the Fate, but overall is a solid melodic song, [...] The third track “The Drug in Me is You” was the second single and the band’s first video and might I add a very entertaining video. “The Drug in Me is You,” is a nicely constructed musical performance that is just flat out catchy. [...] To me the song is about something most people can relate to, the battle you have with yourself, with your morality, with your demons. [...] We all know that we can be our own worst enemy and the only person that you truly have to blame in many instances is yourself. [...] “Trying to consume, the drug in me is you and I’m so high on misery can’t you see,” evokes the feeling that you are your own drug, the creator of your misery and if you need to point fingers at someone try looking in the mirror first. [...] “If we are born to die and we all die to live, then what’s the point of living life if life just contradicts?” [...] Questions we all ask when we pick ourselves up off the floor and do the only thing we can do, try again. [...] Life is what you make of it, if you have lost yourself, it is <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> find your way again. [...] I got all profound there for a second, it happens.|$|E
500|$|Owing to the {{combination}} of Pink Floyd's partial breakup and Waters' dominance on the project, The Final Cut is sometimes viewed as a de facto Waters solo album. [...] The personal quality assigned to the lyrics are related to Waters' struggle to reconcile his despair at the changing social face of Britain, and also {{the loss of his}} father during the Second World War. [...] Gilmour's guitar solos on [...] "Your Possible Pasts" [...] and [...] "The Fletcher Memorial Home" [...] are, however, sometimes considered the equal of his best work on The Wall. [...] More recent reviews of the album have weighed its importance alongside the band's breakup. [...] Writing for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine said [...] "with its anger, emphasis on lyrics, and sonic textures, it's clear that it's the album that Waters intended it to be. [...] And it's equally clear that Pink Floyd couldn't have continued in this direction...", [...] Stylus Magazine wrote: [...] "It's about pursuing something greater even when you have all the money that you could ever want. [...] And either failing or succeeding brilliantly. [...] It's <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> decide whether this record is a success or a failure, but I'd go with the former every time." [...] Rachel Mann of The Quietus said [...] "flawed though it is, The Final Cut remains a tremendous album" [...] and [...] "still has something fresh to say". [...] Mike Diver of Drowned in Sound was less generous: [...] "Rays of light are few and far between, and even on paper the track titles – including 'The Gunner's Dream' and 'Paranoid Eyes' – suggest an arduous listen. [...] Q Magazine once compiled a top ten list of depressing records, and this was on it. [...] Enough said, I think." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{his return}} in 1855, Hunt founded the first American {{architectural}} school at his Tenth Street Studio Building (beginning with only four students), co-founded the American Institute of Architects and from 1888 to 1891 {{served as the}} Institute's third president, brought the first apartment building to Manhattan {{in a burst of}} scandal, and set a new ostentatious style of grand houses for the social elite and the eccentric, competitive new millionaires of the Gilded Age. His philosophy of architectural work may be summed up in his quote [...] "The first thing you've got to remember is that it's your client's money you're spending. Your goal is to achieve the best results by following their wishes. If they want you to build a house upside down standing on its chimney, it's <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{had found}} the pig eating his tubers. This {{was not the first}} occurrence. Cutlar was so upset that he took aim and shot the pig, killing it. It turned out that the pig was owned by an Irishman, Charles Griffin, who was {{employed}} by the Hudson's Bay Company to run the sheep ranch. He also owned several pigs that he allowed to roam freely. The two had lived in peace until this incident. Cutlar offered $10 to Griffin to compensate for the pig, but Griffin was unsatisfied with this offer and demanded $100. Following this reply, Cutlar believed he should not {{have to pay for the}} pig because the pig had been trespassing on his land. (A probably apocryphal story claims Cutlar said to Griffin, [...] "It was eating my potatoes." [...] Griffin replied, [...] "It is <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> keep your potatoes out of my pig.") When British authorities threatened to arrest Cutlar, American settlers called for military protection.|$|E
