2500|$|Berry {{recalls the}} artistic {{inspiration}} he obtained from... "the streets of my early childhood, the moorland landscape, pit villages, public houses, chip shops, night town and later avenue life." [...] Lamenting change, he bemoans that, [...] "the old wooden mangle rollers {{were replaced by}} rubber wringers, the iron range grate by little fancy tiled affairs, the elegant, slim paper packets of five Woodbines disappeared..." [...] He felt {{he had been born}} into a tightly cohesive society, but [...] "the values that had held the working class together began to slowly be eroded." [...] He loved a world that was filled with, [...] "a line of shunted coal waggons...wreaths of steam and a smell of gas...youths playing cards {{at the back of the}} old knackers yard...old men cough in the betting shops and huge fat women queue in the Co-op...the chain row and pit-head gear." [...] This was a [...] "place of empty chapels and aborted kilns", [...] "the window cleaner with wild eyes and a mania for gambling", or indeed [...] "an effeminate man who wears a ginger wig...muttering to himself all day, he pushes an old pram with a bird cage in it." [...] Touchingly, he noticed the habits of the people: [...] "at weekends when you are flush and filled with drink or the prospect of drink", and when one might feel [...] "as dry as a lime-burner's clog." [...] He loved [...] "the sunken bricks of his garden path." [...] and even a visit to the gents could become an inspiring revelation: [...] "as I stand piddling in the crazed <b>urinal</b> <b>stall</b> I can see the red and green tail lights of some night plane moving across this area of infinite velvet over the darkened hoop of the world." ...|$|E
50|$|On January 4, 2017, Rogers asked a {{man next}} to his <b>urinal</b> <b>stall</b> to go into another stall for a handjob. After the man declined, Rogers grabbed the man's butt as he was still using the urinal. The man made a quick exit and called the police.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} plan {{shows that the}} <b>urinal</b> <b>stalls</b> were connected to a main drain by a 4-inch pipe. The closet was an earth closet. A brick archway in the wall {{at the back of}} the closet and evidence of brick infill shows where access may have been provided for a pan service.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} {{plans are}} unsigned but were probably {{drawn by the}} Toowoomba City Engineer, Mr Creagh. The <b>urinal</b> <b>stalls</b> were originally connected to the nearby drain; the closet was cleaned by a pan changing service. The whole ensemble was only connected to the sewerage system in 1926. The manhole covers {{at the rear of}} the toilet may date from the time of the sewerage connection. In 1933 plans were made to alter the building but these were not carried out. The building was originally set in a [...] "rockery and garden" [...] which may have been destroyed after the Second World War. Certainly nothing now remains of the original rockery except perhaps the palm trees {{at the rear of the}} toilet.|$|R
5000|$|... 'Luxury' {{portable}} toilets also exist. They {{are typically}} mounted on large [...] "office-like" [...] trailers or made from converted shipping containers. They contain every amenity that a public toilet would have such as running water, flushing toilet, <b>stalls,</b> <b>urinals,</b> mirrors, lighting, and even {{air conditioning and}} hot water in some cases. However, these luxuries come at a price as these trailers typically cost multiple times more than a typical portable toilet to buy or rent. They are commonly found at weddings, high end events/charities, and movie shoots.|$|R
