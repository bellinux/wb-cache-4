40|$|Abstract:- For {{low power}} wind energy or micro-hydel {{applications}} {{of the order of}} 1 - 10 KW, the lowest cost can be achieved if the generator is a simple squirrel cage induction motor used as a self excited induction generator (SEIG). The induction generator output can be rectified to produce a DC Bus from which a single phase inverter can feed the power supply grid. A SEIG requires capacitors to be connected to the three terminals to provide reactive power as it is not directly connected to the power supply grid. The aim of the paper is to check the feasibility of wind power generation with a 2 KW squirrel cage induction motor used as a generator.

40|$|This thesis {{report is}} {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Electronics and Communication Engineering, 2014. Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 41). Power Factor, the ratio between the real power and the apparent power forms a very essential parameter in power system. It is indicative of how effectively the real power of the system has been utilized. With rapid development in power semiconductor devices, the usage of power electronic systems has expanded to new and wide application range that include residential, commercial, aerospace and many others. Power electronic interfaces {{have proved to be}} superior. However, their non‐linear behavior puts a question mark on their high efficiency. The current drawn by the interfaces from the line is distorted resulting in a high Total Harmonic Distortion(THD) and low Power Factor(PF). Individually, a device with harmonic current does not pose much serious problem however when used on a massive scale the <b>utility</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> condition could be deteriorated. Other adverse effects on the power system include increased magnitudes of neutral currents in three‐phase systems, overheating in transformers and induction motors etc. Hence, there is a continuous need for power factor improvement and reduction of line current harmonics. Development of new circuit topologies and control strategies for Power Factor Correction (PFC) and harmonic reduction has become essential. This project aims to develop a circuit for PFC using passive filters. M. M. Emran HassanAfrin SultanaSunjida AktherB. Electrical and Electronic Engineerin...|$|E

They are designed to provide clean and continuous power to the load under essentially any normal or abnormal <b>utility</b> <b>power</b> condition. Among the various UPS topologies such as online UPS, offline UPS and line interactive UPS, online UPS are widely used. In this paper hardware implementation of single phase 50 Hz, online uninterruptable <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> with over voltage, under voltage and phase out protection have been carried. Atmega 32 microcontroller is the heart of the system and controls entire system. By programming the microcontroller using embedded C, SPWM pulses to drive H-bridge are generated. By alternating switching switches of two legs of H-bridge alternating 9 V DC voltage is converted into 9 V Ac voltage. Output of H-bridge is given to step up transformer to step up the voltage to 220 V, 50 Hz. The microcontroller is so programmed that at every instant it checks the voltage that is supplied to the load through sensors. At any instant if it detects that there is over voltage, under voltage or phase out, microcontroller acts to isolate the load from the power source by sending tripping signal to relay. Once relay isolates the load from the <b>power</b> source, microcontroller <b>supplies</b> the load through the charged battery. Battery supplies the load until the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> voltage reaches normal value of voltage...|$|R

The drawback of air source heat pumps is the reduction in efficiency as the outdoor air become colder, resulting in lower heat supply in times when it is most needed. Despite its inverse relationship between efficiency and outdoor temperature, air source heat pumps were installed in 57000 detached houses in Sweden during 2010 alone, which is 3 % of the total detached houses stock. That makes air source heat pumps the most sold heating technology for detached houses in Sweden during 2010, 1. 6 times more than the number of installations of ground source heat pump and 3 times more than the number of connections of detached houses to district heating during the same year.
