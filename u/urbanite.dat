Ilaiyaraaja's sense of visualization for composing music is always to match up with the storyline of the running movie and possibly by doing so, he creates the best experience for the audience to feel the emotions flavored through his musical score. He mastered this art of blending music to the narration, which very few others managed to adapt themselves over a longer time.|$|E

By testing hypotheses on active church membership and several features of social networks through multivariate regression models, we find that the differences {{in the number}} of informal helpers between <b>urbanites</b> and villagers are (partially) explained by the number of network members, the number of friends within the social network and the multifunctionality of relationships. ...|$|R

For now, there are many problems in the city of Tokyo, such as lack of communication with other people, lack of public space and green spaces, and environmental issues. In order to improve these problems, I conducted a review of existing literature/scholarship and a survey of Tokyo <b>urbanites.</b> It asked them their perceptions about public open spaces to understand their desires for design in the {{urban landscape}} in Tokyo. I then applied these results to my design intervention called fuzzy spaces. Fuzzy space allows users to watch and see natural elements and people’s activities which Tokyo <b>urbanites</b> desire and places like an engawa within the structure of the historical Japanese house. I hope to my design thesis project inspires future designs of Tokyo to successfully provide a place for resting and socialization, and serve as a sanctuary for future Tokyo <b>urbanites...</b>|$|R

40|$|Summary. One {{consequence}} of China’s marketisation {{has been the}} emergence of a ‘floating population’—rural Chinese who migrate to China’s cities to work. Many <b>urbanites</b> have negative attitudes towards such migrants. To understand how these negative attitudes might be ameliorated, the paper employs Allport’s influential contact hypothesis to investigate whether urbanite–migrant friendships affect attitudes. More negative attitudes were observed among males and older <b>urbanites.</b> There was no effect of simply knowing a migrant, supporting Allport’s thesis that non-intimate contact is not sufficient to affect attitudes. Friendship alone did not influence attitudes, but interaction effects were detected between having migrant friends and each of age, income and education. Negative attitudes were reduced among <b>urbanites</b> in older, higher-income and higher-education groups if they had a migrant friend. In 1978, a process of economic restructuring was initiated in China to transform the existing planned economy into a socialist market economy. While almost all regions of China have benefited from the reform...|$|R
