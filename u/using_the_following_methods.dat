40|$|Abstract. Scientists {{have nearly}} {{unlimited}} access to research directly at their desktops. Troubling {{to us as}} librarians is the scientist’s ability (or inability!) to effectively access this information. The University Library at CWRU, like most academic libraries, has been faced with declining gate counts and reference transactions. In {{order to ensure that}} our students will know how to use the digital materials that we make available to them, we have implemented a primary initiative to increase our teaching role on campus. We aim to create an information-literate community that knows how to navigate the new digital library. Library instruction to academic departments in the physical sciences is an unusual mix, but one that we have had success with at CWRU. In order to reach this group of information seekers, we have had success by <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>methods</b> to reach our community: • Partnering with other constituencies on campus • Creating new ways to provide instructio...|$|E

It {{consists of}} brief biographies of both authors, {{summary of the}} origin of literary stories - fairy tales for simple librettos written by Z. Sverak, the theoretical implementation of the concept of children's operas and a practical analysis of each opera: Budulinek, Karkulka (Little Red Riding Hood), O dvanacti mesickach (The Twelve Months), Sipkova Ruzenka (Sleeping Beauty). Structural analysis has then been applied - the operas were divided into scenes, each musically analysed in terms of their melodies, harmonies and forms. Next, possible didactically challenging parts have been identified and how to use these rhythm, intonation and language issues for lesson planning have been suggested. In the next part of the thesis, the afore-mentioned issues have been empirically verified <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>methods</b> - observation, practical class-leading and reflexive analysis of video recordings.

At this point, the equation (8 a) is examined. This river section, it is 1000  m long. The water velocity is 17 [*]m/s. The diffusion rate of pollutants E is 360.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to find out}} how co-referential {{relationships}} in Czech texts are developed in terms of the information and constituent structures. The data was processed <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>methods.</b> Firstly I examined the available literature on information and constituent structures with special attention being paid to the formation of coreferential relations. This information was then compared to my own research. With regards to disparities between the approaches, it was necessary to introduce some basic terms that are used within my thesis (Chapter 2). Thereafter, I was able to introduce current approaches to the thesis, including the methodological basis of my work, which is represented by the foreign Centering Theory, because unlike other Czech approaches this theory includes predictions on the frequency of different ways of co-referential relationship development (Chapter 3). Secondly, the knowledge gained from literature was applied to two different types of data: corpus material of Prague Dependency Treebank and material obtained through a questionnaire survey (Chapter 4). The most appropriate methods of developing co-referential chains in the Czech text were determined by challenging the prediction model with the obtained data set.

40|$|Dengue fever {{is one of}} {{the main}} public health {{problems}} in the world. Many mosquitoes have developed resistance to the conventional insecticides used. Thus, the search for vegetable extracts and natural substances as alternative insecticides has increased. In this study, chemometric methods were employed to classify a group of terpenoid and phenylpropanoid compounds with biological activity against the larval of the A. aegypti mosquitoes. The AM 1 (Austin Model 1) method was used to calculate a set of molecular descriptors (properties) for the studied compounds. Then, the descriptors were analyzed <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>methods</b> of pattern recognition: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Clustering Analysis (HCA). The PCA and HCA methods have shown to be very effective for the classification of the study compounds in two groups (active and inactive). The electronic variables EHOMO- 1, EHOMO- 2, ELUMO, ELUMO+ 2, and the structural LogP were used to classify as active and inactive compounds. In most studied compounds, the variables responsible for separating active from inactive compounds were electronic descriptors. Thus, it can be concluded that electronic effects play a fundamental role in the interaction between biological receptor and terpenoid and phenylpropanoid compounds with activity against larval A. aegypti mosquitoes. </div...|$|E
