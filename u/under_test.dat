25|$|Most analog {{multimeters}} of the moving-pointer type are unbuffered, {{and draw}} current from the circuit <b>under</b> <b>test</b> to deflect the meter pointer. The impedance of the meter {{varies depending on}} the basic sensitivity of the meter movement and the range which is selected. For example, a meter with a typical 20,000ohms/volt sensitivity will have an input resistance of two million ohms on the 100-volt range (100 V * 20,000 ohms/volt = 2,000,000 ohms). On every range, at full scale voltage of the range, the full current required to deflect the meter movement is taken from the circuit <b>under</b> <b>test.</b> Lower sensitivity meter movements are acceptable for testing in circuits where source impedances are low compared to the meter impedance, for example, power circuits; these meters are more rugged mechanically. Some measurements in signal circuits require higher sensitivity movements {{so as not to}} load the circuit <b>under</b> <b>test</b> with the meter impedance.|$|E
25|$|Focusing {{the light}} beam {{to a point}} {{on the surface of}} the sample <b>under</b> <b>test,</b> and {{recombining}} the reflected light with the reference will yield an interferogram with sample information corresponding to a single A-scan (Z axis only). Scanning of the sample can be accomplished by either scanning the light on the sample, or by moving the sample <b>under</b> <b>test.</b> A linear scan will yield a two-dimensional data set corresponding to a cross-sectional image (X-Z axes scan), whereas an area scan achieves a three-dimensional data set corresponding to a volumetric image (X-Y-Z axes scan), also called full-field OCT.|$|E
25|$|The CTM is a black-box {{testing method}} and {{supports}} {{any type of}} system <b>under</b> <b>test.</b> This includes (but is not limited to) hardware systems, integrated hardware-software systems, plain software systems, including embedded software, user interfaces, operating systems, parsers, and others (or subsystems of mentioned systems).|$|E

25|$|Thermocouples can {{generally}} {{be used in}} the testing of prototype electrical and mechanical apparatus. For example, switchgear <b>under</b> <b>test</b> for its current carrying capacity may have thermocouples installed and monitored during a heat run test, to confirm that the temperature rise at rated current does not exceed designed limits.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{multimeters}} {{are often}} digital {{due to their}} accuracy, durability and extra features. In a digital multimeter the signal <b>under</b> <b>test</b> is converted to a voltage and an amplifier with electronically controlled gain preconditions the signal. A digital multimeter displays the quantity measured as a number, which eliminates parallax errors.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} types of {{vibration}} testing services conducted by vibration test labs are Sinusoidal and Random. Sine (one-frequency-at-a-time) tests are performed {{to survey the}} structural response of the device <b>under</b> <b>test</b> (DUT). A random (all frequencies at once) test is generally considered to more closely replicate a real world environment, such as road inputs to a moving automobile.|$|E

25|$|Auto-ranging, which selects {{the correct}} range for the {{quantity}} <b>under</b> <b>test</b> {{so that the}} most significant digits are shown. For example, a four-digit multimeter would automatically select an appropriate range to display 1.234 instead of 0.012, or overloading. Auto-ranging meters usually include a facility to hold the meter to a particular range, because a measurement that causes frequent range changes can be distracting to the user.|$|E
25|$|It is {{the extra}} loss {{produced}} {{by the introduction of}} the device <b>under</b> <b>test</b> (DUT) between the 2 reference planes of the measurement. Notice that the extra loss can be introduced by intrinsic loss in the DUT and/or mismatch. In case of extra loss the insertion loss is defined to be positive. The negative of insertion loss expressed in decibels is defined as insertion gain.|$|E
25|$|On December 17, 1967, another LM <b>under</b> <b>test</b> {{failed in}} the Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation ascent stage {{manufacturing}} plant. A window in LM-5 (Apollo 11's LM Eagle) shattered during its initial cabin pressurization test, designed to pressurize the cabin to 39 kilopascals (5.7pounds per square inch) above the external pressure. Both inner and outer windows and the acrylic glass cover of the right-hand window shattered when the pressure reached 35 kPa (5.1pounds per square inch).|$|E

The paranormal challenge was officially terminated by the JREF in 2015. The foundation continues to make grants to non-profit groups that encourage critical thinking, and a fact-based world view.|$|E

25|$|The {{impact of}} the new Allied types, {{especially}} the Nieuport, was of considerable concern to the Fokker pilots; some even took to flying captured Nieuports. Idflieg was sufficiently desperate to order German firms to build Nieuport copies and the Siemens-Schuckert D.I imitation was built in quantity. New D type single-seat biplane fighters, particularly the Fokker D.II and Halberstadt D.II, had been <b>under</b> <b>test</b> since late 1915 and {{the replacement of the}} monoplanes with these types had begun by mid-1916.|$|E
