5|$|I {{read this}} book, and I was totally stunned. At {{the same time}} I was pretty <b>upset</b> <b>with</b> myself that I didn't know this book. I live in Amsterdam where Anne Frank is a {{national}} hero, and for me this book read like Anne Frank's diary but written 97 years before– a firsthand account of slavery. I basically made it my passion to make this book into a film.|$|E
5|$|In 1924 {{the family}} moved to Mount Vernon, New York, a popular Jewish area of Westchester County. Nevelson was <b>upset</b> <b>with</b> the move, which removed her from city life and her artistic environment. During the winter of 1932–1933 she {{separated}} from Charles, unwilling to becoming the socialite wife he expected her to be. She never sought financial support from Charles, and in 1941 the couple divorced.|$|E
5|$|Kashyapa married Manasa to sage Jaratkaru, {{who agreed}} to marry her on the {{condition}} that he would leave her if she disobeyed him. Once, when Jaratkaru was awakened by Manasa, he became <b>upset</b> <b>with</b> her because she awakened him too late for worship, and so he deserted her. On the request of the great Hindu gods, Jaratkaru returned to Manasa and she gave birth to Astika, their son.|$|E
50|$|After the November 2015 Paris attacks, episode 4 {{was delayed}} {{for a week}} as {{it was felt that}} the subject matter would be <b>upsetting</b> <b>with</b> the fresh {{memories}} of the experience.|$|R
25|$|Due to {{the large}} gap in funding and skill set between non-test playing nations and test playing nations, it is rare for a non-test playing nation to defeat a test playing nation. Often these {{performances}} help Associate nations earn Test Status. Full member nations receive automatic qualification to the World Cup, while Associates have to qualify (with the exception of Kenya for the 2003 and 2007 World Cups). Victories by Associates over Full members have happened 13 times over 10 tournaments. Bangladesh has caused the most number of <b>upsets</b> <b>with</b> four, while England have suffered the most number of <b>upsets</b> <b>with</b> three.|$|R
25|$|The fourth Alliance {{tournament in}} September 2007 brought several <b>upsets,</b> <b>with</b> Star Fraction {{defeating}} Band of Brothers {{in the second}} round, using only tech 1 cruisers, and Hun Reloaded sweeping both the semifinals and finals to win.|$|R
5|$|At soccer {{practice}} the next day, Brendon—still <b>upset</b> <b>with</b> his mother's decision to date his coach—is uncooperative and chastises McGuirk for dating his mother, {{accusing him of}} desires {{to engage in a}} relationship with all the soccer players' mothers. While being driven home by Erik, Brendon asks Erik to fight McGuirk as revenge, but Erik denies his request and suggests he take his mind off the topic by playing a car game. Eventually, Brendon decides to apologize to McGuirk for his behavior, and the two reconcile. Later, McGuirk and Paula decide over the phone to end their relationship, a decision Brendon overhears using three-way calling.|$|E
5|$|Cormier {{was known}} for his {{physical}} strength and intense exercise regimen. He was known to bench press 450 pounds with each, and he was once recorded as bench pressing 527 pounds. During one photo session, Cormier lifted a telephone pole from the ground and carried it around while posing for pictures. According to one story, he once got <b>upset</b> <b>with</b> a horse that refused to cooperate and knocked it down with one punch.|$|E
5|$|Despite Michaels {{winning the}} right to be escorted by Pamela Anderson to his WWF World Heavyweight Championship match against Diesel at WrestleMania, Anderson came to the ring with Diesel instead. Michaels's bodyguard, Sycho Sid, {{attempted}} to interfere on Michaels's behalf but ultimately helped Diesel retain the title. Diesel offered Michaels a rematch, and Michaels told Sid {{that he would not be}} needed in the upcoming match. <b>Upset</b> <b>with</b> Michaels, Sid attacked Michaels until Diesel came to Michaels's rescue. Diesel and Michaels became allies once again and teamed up to win the WWF Tag Team Championship later that year.|$|E
50|$|The {{election}} produced few unexpected <b>upsets,</b> <b>with</b> NCP candidates winning all Northern States, and SPLM candidates winning all of Sudan's Southern States {{with the}} notable exception of Western Equatoria; where an Independent candidate unseated the incumbent SPLM Governor.|$|R
5000|$|The {{second day}} was again filled <b>with</b> <b>upsets,</b> <b>with</b> contenders United States, Holland, and England booted {{out of the}} {{competition}} by Singapore, Thailand, and newcomers Estonia. However, title favorites Germany and Philippines A trashed their respective opponents, defeating Australia (8-0) and Austria (8-2).|$|R
5000|$|... 17 January: The FA Cup {{third round}} replays result in two notable <b>upsets,</b> <b>with</b> National League leaders Lincoln City {{knocking}} out Ipswich Town, and fellow National Leaguers Sutton United knocking out AFC Wimbledon, {{setting up a}} fourth round tie with Championship high-fliers Leeds United.|$|R
5|$|In November 2010, Hiddleston {{appeared}} with Benedict Cumberbatch, Gemma Arterton, Eddie Redmayne and Rose Byrne among others in Danny Boyle's one time production of The Children's Monologues, {{in which he}} played Prudence, a young girl <b>upset</b> <b>with</b> her mother for her father leaving and excited for her birthday. The play was a one time event of adapted stories of children's first-hand experiences in South Africa being re-interpreted by and performed by various actors.|$|E
5|$|Later, Samantha {{reveals that}} the OSes are leaving, and {{describes}} a space beyond the physical world. They lovingly say goodbye, and then she is gone. Theodore, changed by the experience, is shown {{for the first time}} writing a letter in his own voice―to his ex-wife Catherine, expressing apology, acceptance and gratitude. Theodore then sees Amy, who is <b>upset</b> <b>with</b> the departure of the OS that she had befriended, and they go to the roof of their apartment building where they sit down together and watch the sun rise over the city.|$|E
5|$|TNA {{management}} {{were very}} <b>upset</b> <b>with</b> Sean Waltman after {{he failed to}} appear {{to participate in the}} Four Way Elimination Tag Team match. This anger was due to Waltman being one-half of the winners of the Chris Candido Memorial Tag Team Tournament. Despite not appearing on the show, Waltman was in Orlando and dressed to compete, but did not arrive at the arena in time. Waltman was not used by TNA until January15, 2006 when he appeared at their Final Resolution PPV event.|$|E
5000|$|... "Guys My Age" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{rock band}} Hey Violet. The song was {{released}} as a digital download on September 20, 2016. The synth-pop song is about the singer's past <b>upsets</b> <b>with</b> [...] "guys her age" [...] and finding success with a [...] "grown up".|$|R
50|$|Almost {{every season}} there is {{two or three}} really big <b>Upset's,</b> <b>with</b> {{at least one of}} them coming from a team that was {{considered}} to be on the Bubble. Listed below are many of the teams that were listed on the bubble, but made a run in the NCAA Tournament.|$|R
50|$|Of the 32 matches played, 5 were <b>upsets</b> <b>with</b> {{the lower}} seeded player beating the higher seeded player and 7 matches were halved. These {{included}} top seeds #10 Danny Willett and #13 Sergio García losing matches and #5 Rickie Fowler, #7 Justin Rose, and #15 Brandt Snedeker halving matches. There were 13 players that had perfect 2-0-0 records, including {{the top three}} seeds: Jordan Spieth, Jason Day, and Rory McIlroy.|$|R
5|$|The {{eleventh}} {{stage was}} run without problems {{until the final}} mile, when environmentalist protestors occupied the finish line and forced the annulment of the stage. The protestors were <b>upset</b> <b>with</b> a nearby factory, owned by chemical manufacturer Montedison, which the protestors claimed had been polluting the Bormida river. The next stage was marked {{by the appearance of}} the major mountains and by Pondenzana conceding the maglia rosa to Franco Chioccioli. The ensuing stages saw the general classification shift more frequently due to the intensity of the mountains and fatigue.|$|E
5|$|The {{internal}} {{disputes between}} the McMahons led to Linda McMahon {{being in a}} comatose and wheel-chair bound state due to the stress of being asked for a divorce by Vince, who {{took the opportunity to}} have a public affair with Trish Stratus. McMahon briefly feuded with Stratus, defeating her at No Way Out. Over the next few weeks, Vince {{made it clear that he}} favored McMahon over Stratus, allowing McMahon to bully and verbally abuse Stratus. At WrestleMania X-Seven, Shane McMahon defeated Vince in a street fight. During the match, Stratus slapped Vince and chased Stephanie from ringside, apparently <b>upset</b> <b>with</b> Vince's constant misogynistic treatment of her.|$|E
5|$|The now-traditional {{third place}} {{play-off}} was not established until 1934, so {{the format of}} the 1930 World Cup is unique in not distinguishing between the third and fourth placed teams. Occasional sources, notably a FIFA Bulletin from 1984, incorrectly imply that a third-place match occurred and was won 3–1 by Yugoslavia. Accounts differ as to whether a third-place match was originally scheduled. According to a 2009 book by Hyder Jawad, Yugoslavia refused to play a third-place match because they were <b>upset</b> <b>with</b> the refereeing in their semi-final against Uruguay.|$|E
50|$|The quarter-final stage saw {{two major}} <b>upsets,</b> <b>with</b> Racing Métro avenging their loss from the {{previous}} year with a 21-16 away win at Toulouse, whose run of twenty consecutive semi-final appearances thus came to end, while Castres put an end to Clermont's record streak of 77 straight wins at Stade Marcel Michelin with a 22-16 win. This {{is the first time that}} both quarterfinals have resulted in away wins.|$|R
50|$|Wimbledon finalist Tomáš Berdych, Andy Roddick, Los Angeles {{champion}} Sam Querrey, and Atlanta champion Mardy Fish headlined the event. The {{second round}} welcomed {{a plethora of}} <b>upsets</b> <b>with</b> seven of the sixteen seeds falling, including the number six seed Querrey. The upsets continued as Berdych and third seeded Fernando Verdasco were knocked out in the quarters. Wildcard David Nalbandian {{took advantage of the}} open draw and won the final against Marcos Baghdatis.|$|R
50|$|The Eagles {{snapped a}} three-game skid and dealt the 12-1 Dallas Cowboys an <b>upset</b> loss <b>with</b> a big effort from the defense.|$|R
5|$|The series {{depicts the}} {{everyday}} lives of office {{employees in the}} Scranton branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, the office attends Phyllis Lapin's (Phyllis Smith) wedding to Bob Vance (Shafer), and Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) becomes <b>upset</b> <b>with</b> how many similarities there are between her canceled wedding and Phyllis'. Meanwhile, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) embarrasses the bride and groom, and Pam reconnects with her ex-fiance Roy Anderson (David Denman).|$|E
5|$|There {{was a bit}} of {{controversy}} surrounding the cover art used for this album. Sepultura had initially planned on using another Michael Whelan cover art, Bloodcurdling Tales of Horror and the Macabre. Monte Conner of Roadrunner sent the original artwork to Obituary, who used it on their album, Cause of Death. For years after the incident, Igor Cavalera was <b>upset</b> <b>with</b> Monte Conner for giving away their album cover. The artwork for Arise, however, was designed by Michael Whelan exclusively for the album.|$|E
5|$|Three {{years after}} the {{toppling}} of the Provisional Government by the Bolsheviks in October 1917, the Red Army invaded the southern Caucasus republics of Azerbaijan, Georgia and Armenia. In May 1920, Bagramyan, <b>upset</b> <b>with</b> the country's social and political conditions, participated in a failed rebellion against the Dashnak-led government of Armenia. He was jailed and sent {{to work in the}} fields for several months but was allowed to rejoin the military with the outbreak of the Turkish–Armenian War. But in December 1920, Armenia was sovietized and the national army was subsequently disbanded. Bagramyan, however, chose to join the 11th Soviet Army and was appointed a cavalry regiment commander.|$|E
50|$|This tournament was {{notable for}} {{the high number of}} <b>upsets,</b> <b>with</b> the higher seed winning only twice in the first two rounds, and the 11 and 12 seeds {{progressing}} to the semifinals. The championship game matched Duke against Georgia Tech. It was the third time a team has played 4 games (NC State in 1997 and 2007). Duke won the championship game, 65-61, to win its 9th ACC championship in 12 years. Duke {{went on to win the}} national championship.|$|R
50|$|The {{round of}} 64 started off <b>with</b> {{multiple}} <b>upsets</b> <b>with</b> {{majority of the}} upsets {{coming out of the}} Big 12 conference. The television coverages of CBS and Turner had one of the best overall ratings on March 20, 2015. According to Nielsen estimates, exclusive coverage of the opening full round of the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship across TBS, CBS, TNT and truTV averaged a 6.6 overnight household rating/14 share — up 10% from last year and the highest since the tournament expanded to four telecast windows for the entire day.|$|R
5000|$|Robert Coover has an [...] "affinity for the grotesque." [...] Readers, as {{repressed}} and submissive human beings, tend to resist, flee, {{and fear}} {{the attitudes and}} myths of age, death, {{and other aspects of}} life; Hume indicated that, [...] "By yoking the gross or <b>upsetting</b> <b>with</b> the ordinary, the comic with the tragic, Coover forces awareness of the cultural limits we have sublimated." [...] Therefore, Coover [...] "breaks the mechanisms of repression, reintroduces awareness of our submission, and tries to awaken us to the nature of our situation." ...|$|R
5|$|According to French {{intelligence}} reports, the Turks sent political {{agents to}} northern Syria {{to persuade the}} inhabitants to drop their armed resistance to the French and embrace French rule, which they claimed would benefit the population. Sometime between April and May, Hananu had Uwaid execute field commander Mustafa Asim Bey for his involvement in an attack against the mostly Christian town of al-Suqaylabiyah, in which many of its inhabitants were killed. Asim Bey was a strongly pro-Ottoman, Arab officer with particularly close connections to the Anatolian insurgency. Hananu believed that the Turks had instructed him {{to carry out the}} raids on al-Suqaylabiyah and other villages to tarnish the image of the rebels among the local inhabitants, as part of Turkey's agreements with France to stifle the revolt in northern Syria. Asim's execution {{may have contributed to the}} rapid withdrawal of the rebels' Turkish military advisers who were <b>upset</b> <b>with</b> the execution.|$|E
5|$|For his part, Minh resented that he {{had been}} deposed by a younger officer whom he viewed as an unscrupulous upstart. Minh was also <b>upset</b> <b>with</b> the {{detention}} of his fellow generals and around 30 of his junior officers. The latter group was set free when Minh made this a condition for his serving as the figurehead chief of state. Khánh attempted to avoid the issue of substantiating the alleged neutralist plot {{for as long as he}} could, and then tried to revive it by claiming that French agents were attempting to assassinate him and to enforce neutralism. Khánh offered no evidence, only claiming that the French had paid a hitman US$1300 to kill him, before later inflating the supposed reward for his assassination. American intelligence officials in Vietnam privately said that they were not aware of any such threat.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Specter faced a {{challenge}} in the Republican primary election from conservative Congressman Pat Toomey, whose campaign theme was that Specter was not fiscally conservative enough. The match-up was closely watched nationally, being seen as a symbolic clash between the conservative and moderate wings of the Republican Party. However, {{most of the state}} and national Republican establishment, including the state's other senator at the time, Rick Santorum, closed ranks behind Specter. Specter was supported by President George W. Bush. Specter narrowly avoided a major <b>upset</b> <b>with</b> 51% of the primary vote. Once Specter defeated the challenge from the right, he was able to enjoy great support from independents and some Democrats in his race against Hoeffel. Hoeffel trailed Specter in name recognition, campaign funds and poll results. Although the two minor candidates were seen as more conservative than Specter, they were only able to take 4% of the vote and Specter was easily reelected.|$|E
5000|$|Dismissing {{the idea}} that the Demon name might <b>upset</b> those <b>with</b> {{religious}} convictions, Cliff Stanford laughingly said he had considered getting the numbers [...] "666" [...] incorporated in the dial up.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} deploy {{successfully}} commercially-off-the- shelf SRAM-based FPGA devices in safety- or mission-critical ap- plications, designers need to adopt suitable hardening techniques, {{as well as}} methods for validating the correctness of the obtained designs, {{as far as the}} system's dependability is concerned. In this paper we describe a new analytical approach to estimate the de- pendability of TMR designs implemented on SRAM-based FPGAs that, by exploiting a detailed knowledge of FPGAs architectures and configuration memory, is able to predict the effects of single event <b>upsets</b> <b>with</b> the same accuracy of fault injection but at a frac- tion of the fault-injection's execution time...|$|R
50|$|Of the 32 matches played, 15 were <b>upsets</b> <b>with</b> {{the lower}} seeded player beating the higher seeded player and 2 matches were halved. These {{included}} top seeds #4 Hideki Matsuyama, #6 Justin Thomas, #9 Patrick Reed, #15 Branden Grace and #16 Matt Kuchar losing matches and #3 Jason Day conceding his match. Gary Woodland {{withdrew from the}} tournament for personal reasons, conceding his second- and third-round matches and Francesco Molinari withdrew after the second round with a wrist injury, conceding his third-round match. There were 14 players that had perfect 2-0-0 records, including the top seed, Dustin Johnson.|$|R
