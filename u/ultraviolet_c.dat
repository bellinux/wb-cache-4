5000|$|<b>Ultraviolet</b> <b>C</b> or (UVC) range, which spans a {{range of}} 100 to 280 nm. The term {{ultraviolet}} refers {{to the fact that}} the radiation is at higher frequency than violet light (and, hence, also invisible to the human eye). Due to absorption by the atmosphere very little reaches Earth's surface. This spectrum of radiation has germicidal properties, as used in germicidal lamps.|$|E
50|$|The Lyman {{limit is}} at the {{wavelength}} of 91.2 nm (912 Å), corresponding to a frequency of 3.29 million GHz and a photon energy of 13.6 eV. LyC energies are mostly in the <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>C</b> portion {{of the electromagnetic spectrum}} (see Lyman series). Although X-rays and gamma-rays will also ionize a hydrogen atom, there are far fewer of them emitted from a star's photosphere - LyC are predominantly UV-C. The photon absorption process leading to the ionization of atomic hydrogen can occur in reverse: an electron and a proton can collide and form atomic hydrogen. If the two particles were traveling slowly (so that kinetic energy can be ignored), then the photon the atom emits upon its creation will theoretically be 13.6 eV (in reality, the energy will be less if the atom is formed in an excited state). At faster speeds, the excess (kinetic) energy is radiated (but momentum must be conserved) as photons of lower wavelength (higher energy). Therefore, photons with energies above 13.6 eV are emitted by the combination of energetic protons and electrons forming atomic hydrogen, and emission from photoionized hydrogen.|$|E

The difference in rate of response, measured as change in plaque thickness, and the difference in time to complete clearance of psoriasis between irradiated and non-irradiated forearm lesions was significantly greater for patients treated using fluorescent lamps with negligible <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>C</b> emission (Wolff Helarium) than for those patients treated with a medium pressure mercury arc lamp (p less than 0. 01) or an array of fluorescent sunlamps (p less than 0. 05).

40|$|ABSTRACT Grape juice {{has been}} widely studied due to the {{presence}} of phenolic compounds and its beneficial effects on human health. <b>Ultraviolet</b> irradiation <b>C</b> (UV-C) can increase the content of phenolic compounds and anthocyanins and contribute to sensory acceptability. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of different doses of <b>ultraviolet</b> irradiation <b>C</b> (UV-C) on ‘Trebbiano’, ‘Niagara Branca’, ‘Isabel’ and ‘Cabernet Sauvignon’ grapes, as well as effect of the storage period. Juices were elaborated and evaluated for physicochemical analyses, and for the sensorial analysis in irradiated samples. In ‘Niagara Branca’ and ‘Trebbiano’ cultivars, storage and irradiation promoted few physicochemical alterations, and sensorially, irradiation reduced the intensity of flavor and color attributes. In juices from ‘Isabel’ and ‘Cabernet Sauvignon’ cultivars, the storage period led to the concentration of sugars and irradiation influenced physicochemical parameters and increased the intensity of aroma attribute at dose of 2 kJ m- 2. Thus, UV-C irradiation contributes little for the improvement of white grape juices; however, it favors some sensory attributes in red grape juice, requiring further studies to elucidate the influence of UV-C irradiation on the phenolic and volatile composition of grape juice...|$|R

At 43 C these strains become sensitive to <b>ultraviolet</b> and mitomycin <b>C,</b> while showing only a slight decrease in recombination proficiency.

40|$|Our {{laboratory}} {{has previously}} demonstrated that ultraviolet B radiation impairs contact hypersensitivity induction in ultraviolet B susceptible mice through a tumor necrosis factor-α-dependent mechanism, involving calcitonin gene related peptide and cutaneous mast cells. This {{study was designed}} to test directly whether mast cells are the source of tumor necrosis factor-α, to account for the ultra-violet B-susceptible phenotype. As dermal mast cells seem to release tumor necrosis factor-α following exposure to ultraviolet B, we investigated whether tumor necrosis factor-α released by mast cells could mediate impairment of contact hypersensitivity {{in a manner similar to}} that found with ultraviolet B radiation treatment. First, we loaded Fcε receptors of mast cells of <b>ultraviolet</b> B-susceptible (<b>C</b> 3 H/HeN), <b>ultraviolet</b> B-resistant (<b>C</b> 3 H/HeJ), and mast-cell deficient (Sl/Sld) mice by intradermal injections of anti-dinitrophenyl immunoglobulin E antibodies. Twenty-four hours later, dinitrophenyl was injected intravenously, and within 30 min oxazolone was painted on injected skin sites. Contact hypersen-sitivity induction was impaired in ultraviolet B-susceptible mice, but not in ultraviolet B-resistant or Sl/Sld mice, and treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor-α antibodies was able to reverse this impairment of contact hypersensitivity. Second, we have found that ultraviolet B radiation did not impair contact hypersensitivity induction when haptens were painted on irradiated skin of mast cell deficient mice. As ultraviolet B radiation impairs contact hypersensitivity induction through a tumor necrosis factor-α-dependent mechanism, we conclude that ultraviolet B radiation triggers the prompt release of tumor necrosis factor-α from dermal mast cells, and that mast cell-derived tumor necrosis factor-α interferes with generation of the hapten-specific signal required for contact hypersensitivity induction. In addition, we are providing data that indicate that tumor necrosis factor-α levels released from mast cells as well as sensitivity of Langerhans cells to tumor necrosis factor-α contribute in defining the phenotypes of resistance versus sensitivity to ultra-violet B radiation...|$|R
