He argued that each was relevant in a certain context—i.e., a set of interrelated conditions within the explicate order—rather than having <b>unlimited</b> <b>scope,</b> <b>and</b> that apparent contradictions stem from attempts to overgeneralize by superposing the theories on one another, implying greater generality or broader relevance than is ultimately warranted. Thus, [...] argued: [...] "... in sufficiently broad contexts such analytic descriptions cease to be adequate ...
