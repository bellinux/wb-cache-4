5|$|A {{concurrent}} <b>use</b> registration, in United States trademark law, is {{a federal}} trademark registration of the same trademark to two or more unrelated parties, with each party having a registration limited to a distinct geographic area. Such a registration is achieved by filing a concurrent <b>use</b> application (or by converting an existing application to a concurrent <b>use</b> application) and then prevailing in a concurrent <b>use</b> proceeding before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board ("TTAB"), which is a judicial body within the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO"). A concurrent <b>use</b> application may be filed {{with respect to a}} trademark which is already registered or otherwise in <b>use</b> by another party, but may be allowed to go forward based on the assertion that the existing <b>use</b> can co-exist with the new registration without causing consumer confusion.|$|E
