5000|$|A <b>folding</b> <b>machine</b> is {{a machine}} used {{primarily}} for the folding of paper. Paper can be folded with either a buckle or a knife; thus, there are generally three types of folding machines: buckle folders, knife folders {{or a combination of}} these two types. Whilst buckle folding is the more popular of the two methods, knife folding is sometimes preferable. <b>Folding</b> <b>machine</b> models vary in sophistication, with [...] machines capable of processing more complex folding jobs and unusual paper forms (in terms of density and size). Organizations required to undertake mass mail-out campaigns often employ <b>folding</b> <b>machines</b> to improve efficiency.|$|R

40|$|To date, {{little is}} known either about the {{physical}} interactions of heat shock protein 10 (Hsp 10) with other proteins within the cell or its involvement in signal transduction pathways. Hsp 10 has been considered mainly as a partner of Hsp 60 in the Hsp 60 / 10 protein <b>folding</b> <b>machine.</b> Only recently, Hsp 10 was reported to interact with proteins involved in deoxyribonucleic acid checkpoint inactivation, termination of M-phase, messenger ribonucleic acid export, import of nuclear proteins, nucleocytoplasmic transport, and pheromone signaling pathways. At the same time, Hsp 10 expression can be up-regulated in cancer cells, because it accumulates as the cell transformation progresses. Recent data suggest that Hsp 10 may be not only {{a component of the}} <b>folding</b> <b>machine</b> but also an active player of the cell signaling network, influencing cell cycle, nucleocytoplasmic transport, and metabolism, with putative roles in the lack of cell differentiation and in the inhibition of apoptosis.

The design need emanated from the strained national electrical grid system that has recently seen industrialists and households in Zimbabwe experiencing major power cuts. The machine enables manufacturers to schedule heavier jobs during periods when power supply is up and lighter jobs during power cut periods hence run their workshops throughout the daily production shifts. The two hydraulic cylinders can be disengaged from the <b>machine?s</b> <b>folding</b> beam so that manual operation can be done through a manual clamping lever system. The folding force at full capacity is 294. 6 KN (29. 46 Ton), total bending length of 1. 8 m and working height of 1 m.
