50|$|After {{setting up}} {{production}} at a disused furniture factory and ramping up production, {{one of the}} blades failed and it was traced to {{a problem in the}} spar. At least some of the problem appeared to stem from spot welding a metal collar on the stringer to the metal spar. The collar was built into the stringer during construction, then slid onto the spar and welded in the proper position.

30|$|Several studies [76, 77, 97, 98] have {{reported}} on mounting tissues <b>using</b> <b>adhesive</b> tape, particularly {{in cases where}} {{it is difficult to}} fix the sample plate in a thaw-mounted manner in MALDI MSI due to size. Attaching fragile tissues <b>using</b> <b>adhesive</b> tape [76] and the CryoJane Tape-Transfer System® [77] can aid in preparing animal samples as well as tissue sections of plant samples. Lee’s group is actively conducting metabolite studies with MALDI-MS of maize seed section [97] and lipid mapping in a single cell of zebrafish embryo [98] by utilizing CryoJane tape in sample preparation. However, Kim et al. [85] recently reported on ToF–SIMS imaging results <b>using</b> <b>adhesive</b> tape. They compared ToF–SIMS images of corn seed tissues acquired using thaw-mounted preparation and 3  M tape mounted method. Unlike the thaw-mounted method, MSI results with undistorted location information of fatty acids and phospholipids present in the corn seed tissue were acquired when the corn seed tissue was mounted <b>using</b> <b>adhesive</b> tape. This was achieved without contamination of the embedding substance gelatin. A follow-up study by Lee’s group [83] described the polymer material in the adhesive tape as acting like insulation between the sample plate and the tissue sample, preventing direct thermal energy from being applied to the sample. These results show that ToF–SIMS imaging of hard plant tissue samples is possible without image distortion and with reduced adhesion properties when the appropriate sample preparation procedure is utilized.|$|R
5000|$|Particle levels must be {{controlled}} to nm sizes, and current trends are approaching 10 nm and smaller for particle control in UPW. While filters {{are used for}} the main loop, components of the UPW system can contribute additional particle contamination into the water, and {{at the point of}} use, additional filtration is recommended. [...] The filters themselves must be constructed of ultraclean and robust materials, which do not contribute organics or cations/anions into the UPW, and must be integrity tested out of the factory to assure reliability and performance. Common materials include nylon, polyethylene, polysulfone, and fluoropolymers. Filters will commonly be constructed of a combination of polymers, and for UPW use are thermally welded without <b>using</b> <b>adhesives</b> or other contaminating additives. [...] The microporous structure of the filter is critical in providing particle control, and this structure can be isotropic or asymmetric. In the former case the pore distribution is uniform through the filter, while in the latter the finer surface provides the particle removal, with the coarser structure giving physical support as well reducing the overall differential pressure.|$|E
50|$|Darken’s {{equations}} can {{be applied}} to almost any scenario involving the diffusion of two different components that have different diffusion coefficients. This holds true except in situations where there is an accompanying volume change in the material because this violates one of Darken’s critical assumptions that atomic volume is constant. More complicated equations than presented must be used in cases where there is convection. One application in which Darken’s equations play an instrumental role is in analyzing the process of diffusion bonding. Diffusion bonding is used widely in manufacturing to connect two materials without <b>using</b> <b>adhesives</b> or welding techniques. Diffusion bonding works because atoms from both materials diffuse into the other material, resulting in a bond that is formed between the two materials. The diffusion of atoms between the two materials is achieved by placing the materials in contact with each other at high pressure and temperature, while not exceeding the melting temperature of either material. Darken’s equations, particularly Darken’s second equation, come into play when determining the diffusion coefficients for the two materials in the diffusion couple. Knowing the diffusion coefficients is necessary for predicting the flux of atoms between the two materials, which can then be used in numerical models of the diffusion bonding process, as, for example, was looked at in the paper by Orhan, Aksoy, and Eroglu when creating a model to determine the amount of time required to create a diffusion bond. In a similar manner, Darken’s equations were used in a paper by Wantabe et al., on the nickel-aluminum system, to verify the interdiffusion coefficients that were calculated for nickel aluminum alloys.|$|E

It {{is very important to}} analyze the stress fields at the vertex for evaluating the reliability in three-dimensional joints. There are several methods for joining two different materials.

In joints <b>using</b> <b>adhesives,</b> the thickness of adhesive will influence on the stress intensity at the vertex. In the present study, we investigate the stress singularity fields using a three-dimensional BEM with the fundamental solution for two-phase materials and eigen analysis by FEM. Using the solution for two-phase materials as the fundamental solution in BEM, displacements and stresses at any points in the domain are determined accurately. The order of stress singularity is deduced from the eigen analysis by FEM. The stress fields at the vertex in three-dimensional joints have a power-law singularity and a logarithmic singularity. The stress intensity factor for power-law singularity is determined using a least square method considering the logarithmic singularity. It was found that the intensity of stress at the vertex reduces with decreasing the thickness of adhesive. ...|$|E
