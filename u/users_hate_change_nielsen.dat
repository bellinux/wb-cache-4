50|$|Kit <b>hates</b> <b>change,</b> {{even though}} {{at one point}} she did long for it to happen, and dislikes being {{dependent}} on charities, which spurs her fascination with Amelia Earhart. The books also depict her as being stubborn and somewhat fussy, as she finds chores around the house to be rather boring and tedious, though eventually she realizes her family's misfortunes and learns to be more supportive and helpful.|$|R
50|$|Pat <b>hates</b> <b>change</b> {{as much as}} ever, {{and finds}} in Silver Bush a refuge where she is {{somewhat}} shielded from it, but changes happen nevertheless.

The play closed on August 25, 2013, after 201 performances on Broadway. [...] "The house expanded {{with each of the}} play's moves, first from McCarter Theatre's proscenium stage to Newhouse Theater's thrust stage, then to the Golden Theatre's proscenium stage.

As she shrank the other followed, till presently Lysbeth saw her expression of rage and <b>hate</b> <b>change</b> to one of terror.

50|$|Eventually, Pteppic re-enters the Kingdom and {{attempts}} to destroy the Great Pyramid, {{with the help of}} all of his newly resurrected ancestors. They are confronted by Dios, who, it turns out, is as old as the kingdom itself, and has advised every pharaoh {{in the history of the}} Kingdom. Dios <b>hates</b> <b>change</b> and thinks Djelibeybi should stay the same. Pteppic succeeds in destroying the Pyramid, returning Djelibeybi to the real world and sending Dios back through time (where he meets the original founder of the Kingdom, thereby restarting the cycle). Pteppic then abdicates, allowing Ptraci (who turns out to be his half-sister) to rule. Ptraci immediately institutes much-needed changes.|$|R

In the 2002 film Abandon, written by Oscar winner Stephen Gaghan, Holmes plays a delusional, homicidal college student named [...] "Katie". Todd McCarthy of Variety and Roger Ebert commended her performance, but other critics savaged it. During the final season of Dawsons Creek, Holmes played the mistress of the public relations flack played by Colin Farrell in Phone Booth, which was both critically and financially successful. She also appeared as Robert Downey, Jr.s nurse in The Singing Detective (2003). Dawsons Creek ended its run in 2003, and Holmes was the only actor to appear in all 128 episodes.

Something dropped away from me. I felt the same subtle <b>change</b> in <b>Nielsen.</b> For one thing he stopped talking, except an {{occasional}} word to the mules.|$|R
40|$|We {{address the}} problem of hate speech {{detection}} in online <b>user</b> comments. <b>Hate</b> speech, defined as an “abusive speech targeting specific group characteristics, such as ethnicity, re-ligion, or gender”, is an important problem plaguing websites that allow users to leave feedback, having a negative impact on their online business and overall user experience. We pro-pose to learn distributed low-dimensional representations of comments using recently proposed neural language models, that can then be fed as inputs to a classification algorithm. Our approach addresses issues of high-dimensionality and sparsity that impact the current state-of-the-art, resulting in highly efficient and effective hate speech detectors. 1...|$|R
50|$|Stephanotis {{are grown}} for their {{strongly}} perfumed, waxy, tubular, usually white flowers. Leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and leathery. Stephanotis {{is a beautiful}} but difficult plant - it <b>hates</b> sudden <b>changes</b> in temperature, needs constant cool conditions in winter and is attractive to scale and mealy bug. The stems of Stephanotis can reach 10 ft or more, but it is usually sold twined around a wire hoop. The heavily scented waxy flowers appear in summer.|$|R

5000|$|At twenty, Guddu Engiineer, {{finds his}} life close to perfect. Two great friends, an {{engineering}} course in progress and acceptance by {{the girl he}} loves. But then one simple choice between love and <b>hate</b> <b>changes</b> it all. To impress upon the lovely Sonia Kashyap, Guddu prepares a list of everything she likes on her birthday. From a Mahendra Dhoni haircut to getting rid of Manucha, the flirt. From gifting her poetry by Rumi to taking the perfect 'DP' over the Allahabad Naini bridge, he is on course to woo Sonia for good. Supporting him all along are his two buddies, ‘Foot- ball’ and ‘Khatri’. However while on this pure and sweet journey, Guddu is also involved in a sinis-ter one - one that would bring him to a crossroads where one path leads to achieving love {{and the other to}} losing it forever. Guddu Engiineer symbolizes the youth, both from India and Pakistan for whom each day is a vote between warmth and loathing. Ultimately the story's moral can be best encompassed with a line from Rumi's poetry which Sonia cherishes: “It's not our task to seek love but the barriers we have built against it." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{genetic makeup}} of a {{population}} reflects its demographic history {{and the effects of}} selection. An expanding population will show less genetic variation than a population of the same, but constant, size. This effect is visible across the genome as a whole. A selective sweep occurs when a positive mutation spreads through a population. Neutral alleles which are strongly linked to this mutation also spread through the population. This process is known as hitchhiking and leads to low genetic variation around the site of the mutation. Classical tests, such as Tajima’s [4], are based on genetic information from a small section of the genome and thus cannot differentiate between the effects of demography and positive selection. Advances in the mapping of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) enable us to differenti-ate between the local action of positive selection and the genome wide effect of demographic <b>changes.</b> <b>Nielsen</b> et al. [2] propose a test for detecting selective sweeps by looking for appropri-ate changes in genetic variation from the background level. Such a test {{has been shown to be}} powerful. However, the level of mutation varies across the genome and without comparing with related populations or subpopulations it may be unclear whether a very low level of variation in a section of the genome indicates the positive selection has occurred or that there is a lo...|$|R

In Hawaii, Nielsen does not use electronic means to track audiences. Recently, only 914 of the printed Nielsen booklets, known as monthly diaries, were completed out of 11,400 diaries.
