5|$|Canids {{are found}} on all continents except Antarctica, having arrived {{independently}} or accompanied human beings over {{extended periods of}} time. Canids vary in size from the 2-m-long (6ft 7 in) gray wolf to the 24-cm-long (9.4in) fennec fox. The body forms of canids are similar, typically having long muzzles, upright ears, teeth adapted for cracking bones and slicing flesh, long legs, and bushy tails. They are mostly social animals, living together in family units or small groups and behaving cooperatively. Typically, only the dominant pair in a group breeds, and a litter of young is reared annually in an <b>underground</b> <b>den.</b> Canids communicate by scent signals and by vocalizations. They are very intelligent. One canid, the domestic dog, long ago entered into a partnership with humans and today {{remains one of the}} most widely kept domestic animals.|$|E
5|$|Mothers {{give birth}} to furred and blind cubs in an <b>underground</b> <b>den</b> near the river shore and fishing sites. Males {{actively}} participate in rearing cubs and family cohesion is strong; older, juvenile siblings also participate in rearing, although in the weeks immediately after birth, they may temporarily leave the group. Pups open their eyes in their fourth week, begin walking in their fifth, {{and are able to}} swim confidently between 12 and 14 weeks old. They are weaned by nine months and begin hunting successfully soon after. The animal reaches sexual maturity at about two years of age and both male and female pups leave the group permanently after two to three years. They then search for new territory to begin a family of their own.|$|E

500|$|The {{birthing}} of {{the litter}} {{of one to}} six (typically two to four) {{takes place in a}} concealed location, such as an <b>underground</b> <b>den,</b> a termite mound, a rock crevice, or in the hollow of a large tree (particularly those of the Commiphora genus). Contrary to older research, litters are of mixed sexes. Young are born in December or January, making the gestation period 90days, with the late mating reports indicating a gestational period of about six to seven weeks. The newborns are blind and toothless and weigh no more than [...] The fur is thin and has been described as gray-brown or nearly white. After about two weeks the cubs' eyes open, they become more active, and their fur darkens to a pearl gray. The cubs do not take solid food until three months old, and do not leave the den until they are 4.5 months old; they are weaned shortly after that. After the first year, the juveniles are independent of their mother. Permanent teeth appear at 18 to 20 months. Physical maturity is reached by about two years of age, but sexual maturity is not attained for another year or two, and the young may stay with their mother until they are fully mature. Lifespan in captivity is up to or past 20 years of age, possibly due to the slow juvenile development.|$|E
2500|$|Fell terriers are bred {{for hunting}} ability and gameness {{rather than to}} a {{standard}} of appearance (breed type). They hunt in packs so must get along well with other dogs. The Fell Terrier was originally developed to hunt the large Fell fox that was believed to cause serious losses for sheep stockmen. The dog needed long legs to follow hunters through heavy snow, and a narrow chest to follow the fox in a stony <b>underground</b> <b>den.</b> [...] In the hunt, a terrier follows the red fox underground into its den, where it either kills the fox, bolts it or holds it until the hunter (terrierman) digs the dog and fox up.|$|E
2500|$|Well-to-do hunters {{of the era}} were {{typically}} accompanied by a pack of hounds and several terriers, often running them both together. The hounds would scent and pursue the quarry and the terriers would [...] "go to ground" [...] or enter into the quarry's burrow and make the kill. Terriers were often the sporting dog of choice for the common man. Early sporting terriers needed to be big enough to tackle the quarry, but not so big as {{to prevent them from}} maneuvering through the quarry's underground lair. As a result, these terriers had to have a very high degree of courage and pluck to face the foe in a tight, dark <b>underground</b> <b>den</b> without the help of human handlers.|$|E

40|$|Nocturnal and siesta resting {{ecology and}} {{behaviour}} of 24 Egyptian mongooses were studied. Mongooses mainly used <b>underground</b> <b>dens</b> (rabbit warrens and badger setts) and thickets in both periods. Tree hollows were occasionally used. Twenty-one individuals used 338 different nocturnal resting sites on 672 occasions. Mean number of resting sites per individual was 16. 1, though resting sites used by each individual increased when sample size did. Mean re-use rate was 1. 99 nights/site. The majority of nocturnal resting sites were only used once, {{and very few}} more than five times. Nocturnal resting sites used two or more times were significantly more often inside than outside home range core areas, whereas resting sites used once were significantly more often outside than inside. Mean distance between consecutive nocturnal resting sites was different among classes of individuals, and annual variations were detected. Eighteen mongooses used 133 different resting sites on 171 occasions during siesta periods. Mean number of different sites used and re-use rate were 7. 4 and 1. 29, respectively. Types of resting sites used during siesta periods changed throughout the year with <b>underground</b> <b>dens</b> predominating in summer. Re-use rates remained constant for the whole year.

It might also be expected to flush foxes from <b>underground</b> <b>dens</b> ("going to earth" [...] like a working terrier), or to act as a lurcher. They tended to be white in colour so as to be more easily seen by the hunter, but they could be any colour.|$|R

50|$|Banded {{mongooses}} live in mixed-sex {{groups of}} 7-40 individuals (average around 20). Groups sleep together {{at night in}} <b>underground</b> <b>dens,</b> often abandoned termite mounds, and change dens frequently (every 2-3 days). When no refuge is available and hard-pressed by predators such as wild dogs, the group will form a compact arrangement in which they lie on each other with heads facing outwards and upwards.There is generally no strict hierarchy in mongoose groups and aggression is low. Sometimes, mongoose may squabble over food. However, typically, the one who claims the food first wins. Most aggression and hierarchical behavior occurs between males when females are in oestrus. Female are usually not aggressive but do live in hierarchies based on age. The older females have earlier estrous periods and have larger litters. When groups get too large, some females are {{forced out of the}} group by either older females or males. These females may form new groups with subordinate males.|$|R

40|$|The {{societies}} of group-living carnivores that neither hunt nor interact cooperatively may arise due to ecological drivers and/or constraints. In {{this study we}} evaluate whether group-living may be intrinsically associated with fossoriality; a link that is well supported in other taxa, but hitherto under-evaluated in the Carnivora. We make two over-arching predictions: i) that fossoriality will be associated with carnivoran sociality; and ii) that this association will be most evident in those species making extended use of subterranean dens. From a meta-analysis of key behavioural, ecological, ontological, and trophic traits, we demonstrate that three quarters of carnivore species exhibit some reliance on <b>underground</b> <b>dens.</b> Congruence between life-history traits and metrics of fossoriality evidenced that: 1) there are phylogenetic, and morphological constraints on wholly fossorial life-histories; 2) fossoriality correlated positively with the extent of offspring altriciality, linked {{to the use of}} natal dens; 3) burrow use increased with latitude; and 4) insectivorous carnivores were more fossorial than predatory carnivores. Corroborating work in the Rodentia, fossorial traits associated strongly with carnivoran group-living tendencies, where species utilising subterranean natal dens are 2. 5 times more likely to form groups than those that do not. Furthermore, using comparative analyses, we evidence support for an evolutionary relationship between diet, fossoriality and sociality. We propose that fossorial dens act as a safe haven, promoting fitness benefits, territorial inheritance and cooperative breeding. We conclude that, among smaller (< 15 kg) den-using carnivores, and especially for omnivorous/ insectivorous species for which food resource dispersion is favorable, continued cohabitation at natal dens can promote cohabitation among adults; that is, philopatric benefits leading to (not necessarily cooperative) spatial groups...|$|R

60|$|Mr. Testator took {{a set of}} {{chambers}} in Lyons Inn when he had {{but very}} scanty furniture for his bedroom, and none for his sitting- room. He had lived some wintry months in this condition, and had found it very bare and cold. One night, past midnight, when he sat writing and still had writing to do that must be done {{before he went to}} bed, he found himself out of coals. He had coals down- stairs, but had never been to his cellar; however the cellar-key was on his mantelshelf, and if he went down and opened the cellar it fitted, he might fairly assume the coals in that cellar to be his. As to his laundress, she lived among the coal-waggons and Thames watermen--for there were Thames watermen at that time--in some unknown rat-hole by the river, down lanes and alleys {{on the other side of}} the Strand. As to any other person to meet him or obstruct him, Lyons Inn was dreaming, drunk, maudlin, moody, betting, brooding over bill-discounting or renewing--asleep or awake, minding its own affairs. Mr. Testator took his coal-scuttle in one hand, his candle and key in the other, and descended to the dismallest <b>underground</b> <b>dens</b> of Lyons Inn, where the late vehicles in the streets became thunderous, and all the water-pipes in the neighbourhood seemed to have Macbeth's Amen sticking in their throats, and to be trying to get it out.

Getting the door open with much trouble, and looking in, he found, no coals, but a confused pile of furniture. Alarmed by this intrusion on another man's property, he locked the door again, found his own cellar, filled his scuttle, and returned up-stairs.|$|R
40|$|Although tree hollows {{seem to be}} key {{structures}} {{for a wide range}} of forest mammals, their importance for Mediterranean forest carnivores remain poorly understood. Here we address this issue, by analysing daily resting site use by 21 radio-collared common genets. Tree hollows were used far more frequently during the wet season (October–April; 73. 1 % of daily locations) than in the dry season (May–September; 47. 6 %). Nests and <b>underground</b> <b>dens</b> were the second and third most frequently used resting sites, respectively, in both wet (17. 5 % and 9. 4 %) and dry (34. 1 % and 18. 3 %) seasons. Each individual reused a large percentage of its resting sites (65. 7 %). Some resting sites (17. 3 %) were used by more than one individual, but simultaneous sharing was exceedingly rare (0. 56 % of daily locations). Hollow use probability during the wet season varied little in relation to environmental variables, though there was a tendency to be higher away from riparian habitats (> 50 m) and to be lower in sites with very high shrub cover (> 80 %). Environmental influences were responsible for more variability in the dry season, when hollow usage was highest in hot days, in days with precipitation, far from riparian habitats, close to sources of human disturbance, in landscapes dominated by continuous forest habitats, and in sites with low shrub cover. Results support the importance of tree hollows for Mediterranean forest carnivores, probably because they provide safe shelter against unfavourable weather, predators and human disturbance. However, results also revealed the importance of riparian trees, which offer support for building nests close to sources of water and food during the dry season. Considering home range size and the average number of hollow-bearing trees used by each genet, we recommend that management of cork and holm oak forests should strive to safeguard at least 4. 6 hollow-bearing trees per 100 ha, while simultaneously maintaining large riparian trees. This will improve the resting habitat for common genets, while presumably favouring also other Mediterranean carnivores...|$|R
