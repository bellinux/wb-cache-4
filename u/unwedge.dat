5000|$|The {{importance}} of the habaki is seen in drawing the katana from the scabbard. It is drawn by grasping the scabbard near the top and pressing the guard with the thumb to emerge the blade just enough to <b>unwedge</b> the habaki from inside the scabbard in a process called [...] (extra2="cutting the koiguchi"). The blade, being freed, can be drawn out very quickly. This is known as [...] (koiguchi o kiru), [...] (nukitsuke), or [...] (extra2="clearing the tanka"). This is obviously an extremely aggressive gesture, since a fatal cut can be given in {{a fraction of a}} second thereafter (see iaid≈ç). It is similar in connotation and effect as drawing back the hammer of a handgun, chambering a round on a pump-action shotgun, or pulling back and releasing the charging handle on other firearms.|$|E
40|$|The Siah Bishe {{pumped storage}} project {{is now under}} construction. The {{investigation}} results, the stability analysis for the power intake shafts and head race tunnels at vicinity of a rock slope are discussed in this study. Power intake shafts and head race tunnels in Siah Bishe dam have a complex geometry. In site investigation was found 3 joint sets in the rock mass. Therefore first of all the structure analyzed for finding underground wedges by <b>Unwedge</b> software. After that overall and local stability of the power intake shafts, the headrace tunnels and slope were analyzed by two conditions (static and pseudo static). Complex geometry of the project due to stability analysis was used 3 D modeling by ABAQUS software. Results show that when a rock slope is closed to a shaft, 2 D modeling is wrong. Especially, there were some other underground spaces, like tunnels.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the engineering geological characteristics of rock {{mass in the}} headrace tunnel, powerhouse, and intake portal of the Kankai Hydroelectric Project. The project area lies in the Lower Siwaliks of east Nepal and consists of alternating sandstone and mudstone beds with frequent siltstone intercalations. The rock mass of the project area was classified according to rock mass rating (RMR) and rock mass quality index (Q) systems. It is of very poor, poor, to fair quality (categories V, IV, and III) in the headrace tunnel; of very poor quality (category V) in the powerhouse; and of fair quality (category III) in the intake portal. The stability analysis of irregularly jointed and fractured rocks of the area was carried out using SWEDGE and <b>UNWEDGE.</b> The analysis gave the safety factor of 0. 45, 0. 64, and 0. 45, respectively for the powerhouse, intake portal, and headrace tunnel. The final safety factors obtained after the installation of support for powerhouse, intake portal, and headrace tunnel were 1. 14, 3. 33, and 4. 53, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose: Dose {{homogeneity}} {{is one of}} {{the objectives}} during computer planning of postoperative radiotherapy of the conserved breast. For three-dimensional (3 -D) optimization of the dose distribution using serial CT scan images, suitable volumes have to be delineated. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop a computer-generated delineation of a plan optimization volume (POV) and an irradiated volume (IV) and to automate their use in a fast dose homogeneity optimization engine. Patients and Methods: Simulation was performed according to our standard procedure which involves the positioning of a lead collar around the palpable breast to facilitate the definition of gantry angle, collimator angle and field aperture for tangential wedged photon beams. In a change to the standard procedure an anterolateral radiograph was taken with its axis orthogonal to the central plane of the two tangential half-beams. Images from a serial CT scan were acquired in treatment position, and the geometric data of the three simulated beams were used by a computer program to generate the POV and IV. For each patient, weights of wedged and <b>unwedged</b> beams were optimized by either human heuristics using only the central slice (2 -D), the whole set of CT slices (3 -D), or by a computer algorithm using the POV, IV and Lung volume with constrained matrix inversion (CMI) as optimization method. The resulting dose distributions were compared. Results: The total planning procedure took, on average, 44 min of which < 7 min were needed for human interactions, compared to about 52 min for the standard planning at Ghent University Hospital, Belgium. The simulation time is increased by 2 - 3 min. The method provides 3 -D information of the dose distribution. Dose homogeneity and minimum dose inside the POV and maximum dose inside the IV were not significantly different for the three optimization techniques. Conclusion: This automated planning method is capable of replacing the contouring of the clinical target volume as well as the trial-and-error procedure of assigning weights of wedged and <b>unwedged</b> beams by an experienced planner...|$|R

The detailed stability analysis of underground powerhouse is done using empirical, analytical and numerical methods. A study has been done to assess the cost optimisation by taking into account the reduction in cost of lining and increase in cost due to increased cost of excavation and rock support. Hydraulic equivalent section has been used in cost optimisation calculations Stability analysis of the underground power house complex of Etalin hydroelectric project consisting of three caverns housing powerhouse, transformer and surge chamber is done and rock support designed. The power house has three caverns located at a depth of 400 m aligned parallel at a spacing of 50 m. The size of powerhouse cavern is 352 m (L) x 23. 5 m (W) x 59. 73 m (H). The total size of transformer cavern is 349. 6 m (L) x 16. 5 m (W) x 24. 3 m (H). Downstream surge chambers of size 165 m (L) x 13 m (W) x 46 m (H) for Dri limb and 110 m (L) x 13 m (W) x 46 m (H) for Tangon limb are provided. The empirical methods include basic rock mass classification methods such as RQD, Q-system, RMR and GSI method based on the field investigation data and geological mapping records.. Rock support design also done suing Q-system. Engineering and mechanical properties of intact rock were recorded from the laboratory tests on rock core samples from drill holes. Rock mass strength and modulus values have been calculated using various empirical relations. The Hoek and Brown rock mass strength parameters were determined using Roclab program. The analytical methods include assessment of stress related problems by calculation of tangential stress using Kirsch&# 146;s analogy, Hoek and Brown practical method. Rock burst impact depth is calculated form Martin and Christiansson. The adequacy of width of rock pillar was verified using Brown and Brady&# 146;s tributary area theory {{and with the help of}} Martin and Maybee&# 146;s study on rock pillars. The numerical methods include <b>Unwedge</b> and Phase 2 programs. <b>Unwedge</b> is used to determine potential wedge failures and spot bolting design for stabilising the wedges. The Phase 2 program has been used to find the principal stress situation, displacemnts, strength factor, volumetric strain, yield zone and rock support design.

40|$|This master thesis "Optimization of {{underground}} caverns for {{the relocation of}} the Sha Tin Sewage Treatment Works? is written {{to look at the}} opportunity to build the new underground facility of Sha Tin Sewage Treatment Works more compact than what is planned at this stage. The preliminary design is seven parallel caverns of 25 m span, built with a 25 m pillar between them, and a minimum overburden of 25 m. During the feasibility study a question was raised; Is it possible to build the facility with 3 caverns of 46 m span instead of the seven 24 m span caverns planned so far. This thesis has been written to look at the opportunity for building those three caverns with 46 m span, and to see how small the pillar between them could be, to make the facility as compact as possible. The preliminary feasibility study {{has been used as a}} background to get an overview of the geological conditions in the proposed area, and these geological parameters have later been used in different analysis methods to look at the feasibility of the project with three caverns instead of seven. The minimum pillar width is found by using the calculation method tributary area learned from the mining industry. Possible unstable wedges have been found using the analytical software <b>UnWedge,</b> and support and stability issues have been looked at with help of the numerical modeling program Phase 2. Through the background studies and the different analysis methods, it is at this stage found that it is feasible to build the facility with 46 m wide caverns, and from analysis it has been concluded that it is possible to build the caverns with only 15 m pillar between them. This is because of the good rock mass in the area, and the assumed favorable horizontal stresses. To be sure of this conclusion it is important to conduct stress measurements in the area before further deciding on the final design. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to estimate the stope dimensions for a future underground mine in Tromsdalen, Verdal. Additionally, the most favourable orientation of the stopes and possible stope layouts will be assessed. Initially, surface mapping was conducted and geotechnical features such as joint orientations, roughness, aperture and weathering were registered. The rock mass quality was assessed using the RMR and Q-system, and the results conclude a rock mass of fair to good quality. The surface mapping of the discontinuities in Tromsdalen founds the basis for evaluation of possible wedge failures in the stopes. The author has completed a small wedge analysis in <b>Unwedge.</b> This concludes that the largest stability issue {{is found in the}} roof of the stopes. Various layout options are assessed against safety, criteria from Verdalskalk AS, and economic viability. It is concluded that longhole drilling or simultaneous blasting of benches are the best options. The stope dimensions were assessed with the help of numerical analyses in Phase^{ 2 }. Two vertical cross-sections through the mine was analysed. The following stope dimensions are evaluated: length 100 - 150 m, width 30 m, height 50 m. The rib and crown pillars were tested for a thickness of 15 m, which is considered unstable. An increase in the pillar thickness is advised, and a 3 D analysis of the problem is recommended to get a more accurate image of the situation. The dimension of the stopes are most likely viable, but the author cannot recommend any final dimensions due to insufficient data. The orientation of the stopes are based on the principle of orienting the longitudinal axis of the stope in close proximity to the bisection line of the largest angle of intersection between the two major joint sets. This results in the most favourable stope orientation being approximately 298 &# 176; NW. The author has also conducted a minor literature study regarding Norwegian underground mines. This was in order to gather information about their mine solutions which {{can be used as a}} basis for comparison in the authors investigation of large-scale underground mining in Tromsdalen. In conclusion, to better assess the stability of the rock mass and decide a final design of the underground mine, stress measurements have to be conducted. The application and knowledge about rock stresses in a mining area is of great importance for the development of the mine design. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{excavation}} of tunnels {{in a rock}} mass changes the existing stress state and initiates deformation processes that, in some cases, can cause instability. Stability investigations, using methodologies capable of verifying both the safety conditions and of representing new scenarios in underground works can be greatly enhanced {{through the use of}} high-resolution 3 D images acquired in combination with ground-based LiDAR. Data from ground-based LiDAR allows the extraction of geological and structural characteristics of the rock mass such as geometries, attitudes, persistence and spacing of joints, even in inaccessible areas. High definition terrestrial laser scanning was adopted in an underground marble quarry, called "Romana", located in the Apuan Alps (Italy), as a support for the geological, geostructural and engineering geological study. Discontinuities were identified and mapped in a deterministic way by using the Leica TruView plug-in which manages laser scanning data and allows representation of the fractures in a georeferenced way either by arcs or by a sequence of aligned points. Given the large quantity of information collected, data were filtered and added to a geodatabase that, after GIS processing and additional in situ engineering geological surveys, was used to create thematic maps illustrating the fracture trends. In this way detailed documentation of the geomechanical and geostructural characteristics of the discontinuities was obtained and subsequently used to model the face stability in different zones of the tunnels. Preliminary analyses were performed by means of numerical modeling in order to calculate approximate stress values around the excavation, and to understand how they change when perturbed. The simulations were carried out using both finite element, (Phase 2; without discontinuities), and distinct element methods (UDEC; including discontinuities derived deterministically from remote sensing data). The calculated stress values were then used to perform a 3 D stability analysis of excavation rock wedges using block theory software, <b>Unwedge.</b> Model results showed that the presence of discontinuities considerably affects both the stress orientation and stress magnitude around the excavation zone, and {{must be taken into account}} to ensure accurate stability analyses. In this context the use of the most recent technologies of remote sensing, together with traditional engineering geological surveys, can provide an important and fundamental contribution. Results of the study to date have been analyzed and discussed with the managers of the underground quarry in order to optimize the planning of future excavations...|$|E
40|$|Chenab basin {{in state}} of Himachal Pradesh has been opened for {{detailed}} study and development of hydropower projects. The government of Himachal Pradesh awarded development of the 260 + 7 MW Sach Khas project to L&T Himachal Hydropower Limited (L&T HHL) on competitive bidding to develop the project on Build, Own, Operate and Transfer (BOOT) basis. It is a dam toe project with underground power house. This work aims to access placement, optimize orientation and perform stability assessment of caverns placed close to toe slope of the valley. To achieve this objective, engineering geological conditions including rock mass properties and stress situation in the Sach Khas project area have been evaluated. Original placement and orientation of the caverns from the background information is assessed. In addition, an alternative orientation is proposed to reduce {{the length of the}} appurtenant tunnel system and minimize the impact of structurally induced instability. The two cases are compared throughout the thesis. An in-depth stability assessment of the underground caverns is carried out, with scope of evaluating possible structurally induced instability and stress induced instabilities for the caverns. The analysis includes analytical, empirical and numerical methods. The analysis detected low cumulative probability for block fall, brittle failure in the cavern roof and tensile fracturing in the cavern walls extending towards slope face due to magnitude and anisotropy in the redistributed stresses. The stress induced instabilities are more extensive than structurally induced instabilities in both cavern alignments due to its placement, orientation, shape and size. Probabilistic <b>Unwedge</b> analysis is done to assess the structurally induced stability problems. Analytical and empirical studies involve Kirsch s equations and Hoek and Brown (1980) methods to assess the redistribution and concentration of stresses in the cavern contour. Spalling potential and depth of brittle failure is estimated based on cavern span, rock mass spalling strength and tangential stresses. The results are compared to estimation of failure depth from numerical analysis using analysis of strength factor with Hoek-Brown brittle parameters in 2 D finite element program, Phase 2. 3 D finite element analysis (RS 3) is carried out for the final selected cavern alignment. Reasonable difference between analytical/empirical and numerical approach is found considering caverns location in low rock cover and near tow slope. Support measures are proposed based on empirical relations, recommendations from the RMR, Q-system and analysis of yielding and deformation from the numerical results. From assessment of engineering geological conditions and in-depth stability analysis, it is considered feasible to obtain a satisfactory level of stability for original alignment, considering the rock mass properties and stress conditions that are most likely to occur. However, the numerical analysis carried out for worst case scenario showed significant stability problems. If such conditions prevail in the area, placing large scale cavern may be challenging regarding stability during construction and long term stability aspects...|$|E
40|$|There {{is a huge}} {{potential}} of underground works in the himalayan region specially in Hydropower. Hydropower {{is one of the}} most economic source of Nepal due to its enormous potentiality in Neplese water resources. Construction of underground structures is not a easy task rather incomplex geology of Nepal. Proper understandings and engineering assessment of Neplese geology is utmost requirement to have optimised, cost effective and safe design of underground structures. This is even more important for underground structure proposed in Mai Hydropower Project. Mai Hydropower Project (MHP), based on run of the river sheme has intalled capacity of 15. 6 MW with 16 m 3 /s of design discharge and Gross head of 121. 6 m. MHP lies in Ilam district of eastern Nepal and dwells in sedimentary units of Siwalik zone according to geological formation of Nepal. The underground structure proposed in Mai Hydropower Project is headrace tunnel of 2147 m in length. The major rocktypes existing in the project area are mudstone, sandstone and siltstone and some minor shear zone has occupied some part of tunnel. To carryout the engineering assessment of MHP headrace tunnel, the entire tunnel has been divided into eight different sections in different rock types with highest and lowest overburden of rockmass. Stability analysis and support optimisation of Headrace tunnel in MHP has been carried out during this thesis work. Preliminary, a semi-analytical, Sakurai's approach has been used to analyse the tunnel stability based on tunnel strain in all the sections selected. Analysis of possible wedge failure has also been carried out using <b>UNWEDGE</b> software. This analysis however, shows that all the wedges that are in sandstone and mudstone sections are stable. And lateron 2 -D numerical modelling program Phase 2 has been used to analyse elasto-plastic behavior of all the sections in detail. Furthermore, hydraulic fracture assessment has been carried out for all the sections applying water head inside the periphery of tunnel. This assessment has been accomplished using phase 2 program and result shows that there is no effect on hydraulic fracturing. As this project is in construction phase and different support system has been finalised by the consultant for different sections of MHP tunnel, the support system defined by the consultant (Sanima Hydro& Engineering (P) Ltd.) has been used in Phase 2 for the evaluation. And finally, support system has been optimised for those sections where the proposed support is insufficient as per the Phase 2 analysis. Preliminary assessment of MHP tunnel shows that two sections, one in Mudstone and other inshear zone have severe squeezing problem and afterwards Phase 2 analysis has also verified that there is maximum displacement occured at these sections. Other six sections have few squeezing problem where the support system defined by the consultant seems sufficient to have minimum support problems. Finally, the overall discussions on stability analysis of MHP headrace tunnel have been presented and some reccomendations have also been proposed for further execution of work. </p...|$|E
