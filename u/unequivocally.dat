5|$|After September 1939, desperate {{efforts were}} made to improve the situation, but with very little result. Germany, for obvious reasons, delayed its deliveries; France was {{hesitant}} to equip an army that would not <b>unequivocally</b> take its side. The one abundant source of readily available weaponry, the Soviet Union, was inaccessible because the Dutch, contrary to most other nations, did not recognise the communist regime. An attempt in 1940 to procure Soviet armour captured by Finland failed.|$|E
5|$|All the {{jewellery}} in the hoard is gold, and all gold {{items in}} the hoard, other than coins, are jewellery. None of the jewellery is <b>unequivocally</b> masculine, although several pieces, like the rings, might have been worn by either gender. There is one body chain, six necklaces, three rings, and nineteen bracelets. The total weight of the gold jewellery is about , and the average metal content of the jewellery pieces is 91.5% gold (about 22 carat), with small proportions in the metal of silver and copper.|$|E
5|$|In August 1844, in {{the midst}} of the campaign, Tyler withdrew from the race. The Democratic Party was by then <b>unequivocally</b> {{committed}} to Texas annexation, and Tyler, assured by Polk's envoys that as President he would effect Texas annexation, urged his supporters to vote Democratic. Polk narrowly defeated Whig Henry Clay in the November election. The victorious Democrats were poised to acquire Texas under President-elect Polk's doctrine of Manifest Destiny, rather than on the pro-slavery agenda of Tyler and Calhoun.|$|E
5|$|The {{differences}} between tantalum and niobium were <b>unequivocally</b> demonstrated in 1864 by Christian Wilhelm Blomstrand and Henri Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville, {{as well as}} Louis J. Troost, who determined the formulas {{of some of the}} compounds in 1865 and finally by Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac in 1866, who all proved that there were only two elements. Articles on ilmenium continued to appear until 1871.|$|E
5|$|As {{the largest}} {{earthquake}} in California since the 1989 Loma Prieta event several years earlier, the mainshock caused a non-destructive tsunami that quickly reached the coast, and eventually Alaska and Hawaii several hours later. The tsunami was significant {{not because of}} its run-up, {{but because of the}} speed with which it reached the coast and for how long the waves persisted. Other strong earthquakes have affected the same area, with some that were clearly associated with the (interplate) Mendocino Fracture Zone, and others (like the two shocks on April 26) were intraplate earthquakes that ruptured within the Gorda Plate, but events that are <b>unequivocally</b> associated with the Cascadia subduction zone are very infrequent.|$|E
5|$|Bradley {{declared}} his candidacy {{early for the}} Republican gubernatorial nomination in 1895, and no real challenger emerged prior to the Republicans' nominating convention. Consequently, Bradley was nominated in a relatively harmonious convention. The major issue of the campaign was whether the country should maintain a monetary system based on the gold standard or allow the coinage of silver {{at a ratio of}} 16 to 1, commonly called the free silver position. At their convention, the Republicans adopted a platform that was <b>unequivocally</b> in favor of the gold standard.|$|E
5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1843 Sam Houston's Texas {{administration}} had returned to negotiations with the Mexican government to consider a rapprochement that would permit Texas self-governance, possibly as a state of Mexico, with Great Britain acting as mediator. Texas officials felt compelled {{by the fact that}} the Tyler administration appeared unequipped to mount an effective campaign for Texas annexation. With the 1844 general election in the United States approaching, the leadership in both the Democratic and Whig parties remained <b>unequivocally</b> anti-Texas. Texas-Mexico treaty options under consideration included an autonomous Texas within Mexico's borders, or an independent republic with the provision that Texas should emancipate its slaves upon recognition.|$|E
5|$|In 1856, Joseph Leidy {{described}} two tyrannosaurid premaxillary teeth from Montana. Although {{there was}} no indication of what the animal looked like, the teeth were large and robust, and Leidy gave them the name Deinodon. Matthew and Brown commented in 1922 that these teeth were indistinguishable from those of Gorgosaurus, but in the absence of skeletal remains of Deinodon, opted not to <b>unequivocally</b> synonymize the two genera, provisionally naming a ?Deinodon libratus. Although Deinodon teeth are very similar to those of Gorgosaurus, tyrannosaurid teeth are extremely uniform, so it cannot be said for certain which animal they belonged to. Deinodon is usually regarded as a nomen dubium today. Additional likely synonyms of G. libratus and/or D. horridus include Laelaps falculus, Laelaps hazenianus, Laelaps incrassatus, and Dryptosaurus kenabekides.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Russian {{president}} Boris Yeltsin disclosed five top-secret memos {{dating from}} {{a few weeks after}} the downing of KAL007 in 1983. The memos contained Soviet communications (from KGB Chief Viktor Chebrikov and Defense Minister Dmitriy Ustinov to General Secretary Yury Andropov) that indicated that they knew the location of KAL007's wreckage while they were simulating a search and harassing the American Navy; they had found the sought-after cockpit voice recorder on October 20, 1983 (50 days after the incident), and had decided to keep this knowledge secret, the reason being that the tapes could not <b>unequivocally</b> support their firmly held view that KAL007's flight to Soviet territory was a deliberately planned intelligence mission.|$|E
5|$|Prior to this burst, astronomers had {{not reached}} {{consensus}} regarding {{how far away}} GRBs occur from Earth. Although the isotropic distribution of bursts suggested {{that they do not}} occur within the disk of the Milky Way, some astronomers supported the idea that they occur within the Milky Way's halo, concluding that the bursts are visibly faint because they are not highly energetic. Others concluded that GRBs occur in other galaxies at cosmological distances and that they can be detected because they are extremely energetic. The distance measurement and the calculations of the burst's total energy release <b>unequivocally</b> supported the latter theory, effectively ending the debate.|$|E
5|$|Ruisdael's {{work from}} c. 1646 {{to the early}} 1650s, when {{he was living in}} Haarlem, is characterised by simple motifs and careful and {{laborious}} study of nature: dunes, woods, and atmospheric effects. By applying heavier paint than his predecessors, Ruisdael gave his foliage a rich quality, conveying a sense of sap flowing through branches and leaves. His accurate rendering of trees was unprecedented at the time: the genera of his trees are the first to be <b>unequivocally</b> recognisable by modern-day botanists. His early sketches introduce motifs that would return in all his work: a sense of spaciousness and luminosity, and an airy atmosphere achieved through pointillist-like touches of chalk. Most of his thirty black chalk sketches that survive date from this period.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} written references {{that have}} survived {{relating to the}} islands were made by Pliny the Elder in his Natural History, where he states that there are 30 Hebudes, and makes a separate reference to Dumna, which Watson (1926) concludes is <b>unequivocally</b> the Outer Hebrides. Writing about 80 years later, in 140-150AD, Ptolemy, drawing on the earlier naval expeditions of Agricola, writes that there are five Ebudes (possibly meaning the Inner Hebrides) and Dumna. Later texts in classical Latin, by writers such as Solinus, use the forms Hebudes and Hæbudes.|$|E
5|$|The {{peace treaty}} of the First Kappel War did not define {{the right of}} {{unhindered}} preaching in the Catholic states. Zwingli interpreted this to mean that preaching should be permitted, but the Five States suppressed any attempts to reform. The Burgrecht cities considered different means of applying pressure to the Five States. Basel and Schaffhausen preferred quiet diplomacy while Zurich wanted armed conflict. Zwingli and Jud <b>unequivocally</b> advocated {{an attack on the}} Five States. Bern took a middle position which eventually prevailed. In May 1531, Zurich reluctantly agreed to impose a food blockade. It failed to have any effect and in October, Bern decided to withdraw the blockade. Zurich urged its continuation and the Burgrecht cities began to quarrel among themselves.|$|E
5|$|Until this burst, astronomers had {{not reached}} a {{consensus}} regarding {{how far away}} GRBs occur from Earth. Some supported the idea that GRBs occur within the Milky Way, but are visibly faint {{because they are not}} highly energetic. Others concluded that GRBs occur in other galaxies at cosmological distances and are extremely energetic. Although the possibility of multiple types of GRBs meant that the two theories were not mutually exclusive, the distance measurement <b>unequivocally</b> placed the source of the GRB outside the Milky Way, effectively ending the debate.|$|E
5|$|Finney {{disagreed}} with the accidental voyaging portion of Sharp's hypothesis. To investigate the problem, he founded the Polynesian Voyaging Society with Herb Kane and Tommy Holmes in 1973, intent on building a voyaging canoe to sail from Hawaii to Tahiti to test whether intentional two-way voyaging throughout Oceania could be replicated. With the help of Mau's navigational knowledge guiding Hōkūle‘a, the Polynesian Voyaging Society demonstrated that intentional voyaging was not only possible, but also the ancestors of the Polynesians could have settled the Pacific on similar voyages using non-instrument wayfinding techniques such as Mau's. Finally, linguistic and archaeological {{evidence suggests that the}} history of the Polynesian people does not originate in the East Pacific but in the West. Recent developments in the field of DNA analysis have <b>unequivocally</b> settled the debate of Polynesian origin. They prove Polynesians share common ancestry with indigenous Taiwanese and East Asians.|$|E
5|$|In the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft {{does not}} make the claim for gender {{equality}} using the same arguments or the same language that late 19th- and 20th century feminists later would. For instance, rather than <b>unequivocally</b> stating that men and women are equal, Wollstonecraft contends that men and women are equal in the eyes of God, which means that they are both subject to the same moral law. For Wollstonecraft, men and women are equal in the most important areas of life. While such an idea may not seem revolutionary to 21st-century readers, its implications were revolutionary during the 18th century. For example, it implied that both men and women—not just women—should be modest and respect the sanctity of marriage. Wollstonecraft's argument exposed the sexual double standard of the late 18th century and demanded that men adhere to the same virtues demanded of women.|$|E
5|$|The Mendocino Fault is seismically active with mostly {{small and}} {{moderate}} earthquakes, but the largest event that was <b>unequivocally</b> {{associated with the}} fault was the M6.9 earthquake on September 1, 1994, at 125.8 W longitude. Aftershocks of that event with corresponding dextral strike-slip focal mechanisms occurred farther {{to the east and}} close to the Mendocino Triple Junction. Another large event (7.3–7.6) occurred on January 31, 1922 (with an aftershock of M7+ the next day) but the sources of these shocks could not be determined with any precision as the first seismographs did not arrive in the area until 1932. Due to their offshore epicenters all of these events caused little damage though were felt across a broad area. Previous Gorda plate events include the July 13 and August 17, 1991, shocks of 6.8 and 7.1 and the M7.3 event on November 10, 1980, west of Arcata.|$|E
5|$|The {{differences}} between tantalum and niobium were demonstrated <b>unequivocally</b> in 1864 by Christian Wilhelm Blomstrand, and Henri Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville, {{as well as}} by Louis J. Troost, who determined the empirical formulas of some of their compounds in 1865. Further confirmation came from the Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac, in 1866, who proved that there were only two elements. These discoveries did not stop scientists from publishing articles about the so-called ilmenium until 1871. De Marignac was the first to produce the metallic form of tantalum in 1864, when he reduced tantalum chloride by heating it in an atmosphere of hydrogen. Early investigators had only been able to produce impure tantalum, and the first relatively pure ductile metal was produced by Werner von Bolton in Charlottenburg in 1903. Wires made with metallic tantalum were used for light bulb filaments until tungsten replaced it in widespread use.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Mikhail Gorbachev {{introduced}} perestroika and its reforms, permitting {{free speech and}} pluralism, Aeroflot had shown considerable growth. In 1950, air transportation only accounted for 1.2 {{percent of the total}} passenger transportation turnover in the Soviet Union, yet, by 1987, air travel accounted for 18.7 of that. It continues growing today. After the Soviet Union broke up, Boris Yeltsin ushered in a new, free market economy. Foreign airlines were permitted to land in Russia and Aeroflot split into several sectors, including today's airline that bears the same name. It became a privatized company, and soon other airlines found their way into the Russian spotlight. Transaero Airlines and S7 (Sibir) Airlines commenced operations in mid-1992. In 1993, Transaero became the first Russian aircraft operator to receive Boeing airplanes. Transaero only operated three Russian built Tu-124 airplanes, the rest of their fleet consists of only Boeing types (747, 777, 767)—modernizing and Westernizing Russian aviation. S7, though originally operating more Soviet-built airplanes, currently fly only Airbus and Boeing types. Aeroflot, too, followed suit. Beginning in 1994, Aeroflot began taking deliveries of Western Airplanes. Aeroflot uses its Airbus and Boeing fleet primarily on Western routes to encourage Western passenger travel. In 2006, Aeroflot joined the global airline alliance SkyTeam, and in 2010, S7 joined a different global alliance, OneWorld. The Soviet aviation industry has <b>unequivocally</b> shifted to adapt more modern and Western philosophies of air travel, although it was the inventive Soviet style of air transportation that helped build Russia, its industries and its widespread global influence into what it is today.|$|E
