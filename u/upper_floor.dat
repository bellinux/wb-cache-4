5|$|The castle {{was damaged}} during World War II, but efforts {{to restore the}} castle began in the {{immediate}} aftermath of the war.

The <b>upper</b> <b>floor</b> and roof were restored in 2002.|$|E

Considerable settlement of the <b>upper</b> <b>floors</b> is evident. Alterations to the building include the removal of some floor structure and the insertion of partitioning to accommodate a cinema and cafeteria.|$|R
5|$|As {{with the}} early days of Sicilian Baroque, the first {{buildings}} of the new neoclassical era were often copies or hybrids of the two styles. The Palazzo Ducezio (Illustration 19) was begun in 1746, and the ground floor with arcades creating play of light and shadow is pure Baroque. However, when a few years later the <b>upper</b> <b>floor</b> was added, despite the use of Baroque broken pediments above the windows, the neoclassical French influence is very pronounced, highlighted by the central curved bay. The Sicilian Baroque was gradually and slowly being superseded by French neoclassicism.|$|E
5|$|Do-Ashiayana Manzil was a {{portable}} wooden house {{used by the}} Mughal emperors during their visits outside their capital. This was a double storied house built with a platform supported over 16 pillars, of 6 yards height. Pillars were 4 cubits in height joined with nuts and bolts which formed the <b>upper</b> <b>floor.</b> This functioned as a sleeping quarter for the king and also for worship and holding Jharokha Darshan, and considered it an emulation of Hindu practice.|$|E
5|$|Sheesh Mahal is flanked {{on either}} side by the Raja Mahal and the Jahangir Mahal. This has royal accommodation, which was built for king Udait Singh. It has now been {{converted}} into a hotel. The interior of this edifice consists of a huge impressive hall with high ceiling, which is the dining hall. Its recent colour scheme renovations are an eyesore. But staying in two of its royal suites on the <b>upper</b> <b>floor,</b> which provide scenic views of the town, gives the guest a feeling of royalty.|$|E
5000|$|The {{design of}} Dallas City Hall {{inspired}} the J. Erik Jonsson Central Library building located {{across the street}} [...] - [...] whereas the <b>upper</b> <b>floors</b> of City Hall are oriented toward Marilla Street, the <b>upper</b> <b>floors</b> of the Central Library are oriented away from Marilla (and, in a form of symmetry, away from City Hall).|$|R
5000|$|The two <b>upper</b> <b>floors,</b> {{divided by}} two thick frames, feature 37 mullioned windows with undecorated stone frames.
