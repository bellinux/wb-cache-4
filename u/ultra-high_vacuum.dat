25|$|The main {{consideration}} with SIMS is {{ensuring that}} the sample is stable under <b>ultra-high</b> <b>vacuum,</b> or pressures less than 10−8 torr. The nature of the <b>ultra-high</b> <b>vacuum</b> is that it ensures the sample remains constant during analysis as well as ensuring the high energy ion beam strikes the sample. <b>Ultra-high</b> <b>vacuum</b> solves {{many of the problems}} that need to be considered during sample preparation. When preparing the sample for analysis, another thing that should be considered is the thickness of the film. Typically, if a thin monolayer can be deposited onto the surface of a noble metal, analysis should be successful. If the film thickness is too large, which is common in real world analysis, the problem can be solved by methods such as depositing a perforated silver foil over a nickel grid onto the film surface. This yields similar results to thin films deposited directly onto a noble metal.|$|E

As such for higher voltage TEMs a third vacuum system may operate, with the gun isolated from the main chamber either by gate valves or a differential pumping aperture – a small hole that prevents the diffusion of gas molecules into the higher vacuum gun area faster than they can be pumped out. For these very low pressures, either an ion pump or a getter material is used.|$|R

40|$|To {{minimize}} the pulse-to-pulse variation, the LCLS FEL must operate at saturation, i. e. 10 {{orders of magnitude}} brighter spectral brilliance than 3 rd-generation light sources. At this intensity, <b>ultra-high</b> <b>vacuums</b> and windowless transport are required. Many of the experiments, however, {{will need to be}} conducted at a much lower intensity thereby requiring a reliable means to reduce the x-ray intensity by many orders of magnitude without increasing the pulse-to-pulse variation. In this report we consider a possible solution for controlled attenuation of the LCLS x-ray radiation. We suggest using for this purpose a windowless gas-filled cell with the differential pumping. Although this scheme is easily realizable in principle, it has to be demonstrated that the attenuator can be made short enough to be practical and that the gas loads delivered to the vacuum line of sight (LOS) are acceptable. We are not going to present a final, optimized design. Instead, we will provide a preliminary analysis showing that the whole concept is robust and is worth further study. The spatial structure of the LCLS x-ray pulse at the location of the attenuator is shown in Fig. 1. The central high-intensity component, due to the FEL, has a FWHM of {approx} 100 {micro}m. A second component, due to the undulator's broad band spontaneous radiation is seen as a much lower intensity ''halo'' with a FWHM of 1 mm. We discuss two versions of the attenuation cell. The first is directed towards a controlled attenuation of the FEL up to the 4 orders of magnitude in the intensity, with the spontaneous radiation halo being eliminated by collimators. In the second version, the spontaneous radiation is not sacrificed but the FEL component (as well as the first harmonic of the spontaneous radiation) gets attenuated by a more modest factor up to 100. We will make all the estimates assuming that the gas used in the attenuator is Xenon and that the energy of the FEL is 8. 25 keV. At lower FEL energies the problems associated with the attenuator become much easier and reformulation of our results for the case of other gases is straightforward...|$|R

2500|$|There {{are several}} {{advantages}} to using helium atoms {{as compared with}} x-rays, neutrons, and electrons to probe a surface and study its structures and phonon dynamics. [...] As mentioned previously, the lightweight helium atoms at thermal energies do not penetrate into {{the bulk of the}} material being studied. [...] This means that in addition to being strictly surface-sensitive they are truly non-destructive to the sample. [...] Their de Broglie wavelength is also on the order of the interatomic spacing of materials, making them ideal probing particles. [...] Since they are neutral, helium atoms are insensitive to surface charges. [...] As a noble gas, the helium atoms are chemically inert. [...] When used at thermal energies, as is the usual scenario, the helium atomic beam is an inert probe (chemically, electrically, magnetically, and mechanically). [...] It is therefore capable of studying the surface structure and dynamics {{of a wide variety of}} materials, including those with reactive or metastable surfaces. [...] A helium atom beam can even probe surfaces in the presence of electromagnetic fields and during <b>ultra-high</b> <b>vacuum</b> surface processing without interfering with the ongoing process. [...] Because of this, helium atoms can be useful to make measurements of sputtering or annealing, and adsorbate layer depositions. [...] Finally, because the thermal helium atom has no rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom and no available electronic transitions, only the translational kinetic energy of the incident and scattered beam need be analyzed in order to extract information about the surface.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{investigate}} thermal behaviour of a thin-walled deployable composite boom (DCB) in a space environment using ground thermal-vacuum test and FEA methods. Thermal tests simulating a space environment include three key conditions, namely <b>ultra-high</b> level of <b>vacuum</b> (lower than 10 - 5 Pa), heat sink (- 180 ℃) that is realized using black panels with the liquid-nitrogen cooling system and thermal loading that is achieved through infrared lamps. The thermal tests of the DCB under seven typical heat fluxes were conducted to characterize heat transfer mechanisms and to obtain temperature fields. The basic heat transfer methods for the DCB in a space environment were surface radiation, cavity radiation and heat conduction. These led to significant temperature difference and gradient occurring on the irradiated and shadowed parts of the DCB at nighttime and daytime. FE models were established to predict temperature fields and thermally induced deformation. Good correlation was achieved between experimental and numerical results...|$|R
30|$|The {{electron}} {{field emission}} has potential to overcome thermionic emission related problems [1 – 4] for merits such as room-temperature operation, low power consumption, and quick response capability. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) possess unique electrical, chemical, and mechanical {{as well as}} structural properties and are regarded as the most promising field emission material with low emission fields and good vacuum behaviors [5 – 14]. The “cold” cathode operation could help to reduce the outgassings, benefiting greatly the <b>ultra-high</b> vacuum/extreme-high <b>vacuum</b> (UHV/XHV) measurement. Many investigations have been conducted to employ the CNT field emission in ionization gauge applications. Murakami et al. presented a Bayard-Alpert type CNT field emission gauge and tested in 10 − 6 to 10 − 4  Torr range [15]. In 2004, Dong and Myneni developed an extractor type field emission gauge based on the MWNTs grown on Ni alloy. The gauge presented excellent measurement linearity from 10 − 10 to 10 − 6  Torr with the sensitivity of about 3  Torr− 1 [16, 17]. Huang et al. replaced thermionic filament of the Bayard-Alpert gauge (BAG) by a line-type CNT cathode, and the gauge performances were studied from 10 − 4 to 10 − 7  Torr with the sensitivity of 3.6  Torr− 1 [18]. Suto et al. developed the CNT electron source by screen printing and studied its ionization gauge application [19].The gauge responded linearly from 10 − 8 to 10 − 4  Torr with the sensitivity of 13  Torr− 1, close to the commercial gauge sensitivity. New gauge designs and structural modulations were also attempted. Sheng et al. constructed a saddle field gauge with a simple ring anode. The gauge was tested from 10 − 5 to 10 − 3  Pa with improved sensitivity of 1.7  Pa− 1 [20]. A simple triode type of CNT ionization gauge was investigated by several groups, {{but there were no}} UHV/XHV measurement results [21 – 25].|$|R

Process of plasma generation in the Vacuum Vessel requires an <b>ultra-high</b> quality of <b>vacuum.</b> To meet those requirements the Vacuum Vessel and adjacent diagnostic systems are exposed to elevated temperature after its assembly to outgas all volatile surface contaminants. The baking temperature peaks at 240 °C for up to 24 hours. On the other side most of diagnostic instruments and detectors adjacent to the Vacuum Vessel, which {{are exposed to the}} same conditions, require much lower temperature during measurement and slightly higher temperature in a stand-by mode. The strictest conditions are defined for liquid scintillators, which require the working temperature around 20 °C and the temperature of destruction several degrees higher. In order to keep diagnostic instruments within required temperature range, a heat shield with a heat removal is necessary. The temperature range is often ± 2 °C or even more narrow in time and space allotted for detectors. Due to space limitations only a thin multilayer solution, including vacuum layers, can be considered. Preliminary calculations indicate that to meet the above defined requirements, only a water jacket as the heat shield can be efficient enough to keep detectors at the required temperature level and within defined range. An additional multilayer vacuum insulation can significantly decrease the cooling demand for the water jacket cooling system. The aim of proposed paper is to find an optimal structure of the insulation thermal shield, based on the water jacket solution by using the CFD simulation in ANSYS Fluent software. Moreover an extended Parametric Analysis is carried out and discussed. The Surface-to-Surface (S 2 S) model is applied to simulate heat transfer by radiation.
