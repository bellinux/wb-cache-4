40|$|Este trabajo profundiza y desarrolla las tesis propuestas en el artículo de 2010 "El derecho a la vida conyugal en la sociedad contemporánea" (publicado en ARBOR), contestando a 10 objeciones, lo cual da lugar a incorporar materiales tomados de la historia reciente de las instituciones matrimoniales y de los hallazgos de la etnografía. This paper ensues {{from the}} debate {{raised by a}} {{previous}} article, «The right to wedded life in contemporary society», 2010, included as a chapter of the Doctoral Dissertation on Juridical Science, «Idea Iuris Logica», 2015, which was a compilation Thesis, whose concluding section was a set of 48 propositions, five of which were given over {{to the right to}} marry, viz. : (1) {{it is one of the}} most essential human rights; (2) it is partly a freedom right but also a welfare right; (3) as an associative right it implies the power not just to start a joint life but also to remain therein and not to be forcibly ousted without due reason; (4) a suitable legal implementation calls for the existence of several cohabitation contracts or covenants of different degrees of mutual commitment and duration, with the possibility of a life-long <b>or</b> <b>perpetual</b> <b>bond</b> for those who choose it; and (5) the current lgislation both in Spain and elsewhere is quite unsatisfactory. Those propositions aroused a heated controversy, ten main objections being levelled at my claims. They broach such issues as same-sex marriage, the clash between an undisturbed wedded life and the rights of children, the purportedly necessary anarchy presiding over any two-membered society, which would entail a permanent right to abandon the partner without cause (repudiation), the significance of marriage as against friendship or togetherness in general and the suspiciousness of perennial commitments. Now I thoroughly go into all ten objections and shore up my assertions with further reasons. Then I canvass historical experience, namely the soviet attempt at demolishing family relations in the period 1917 - 1935, which was doomed to fail; I consider ethnographic evidence, and last I examine the polemics brought about by the UN Human-rights Council Resolution 29 / 22, passed on 2015 - 07 - 02, for the protection of the family. My conclusion is that the West has now chosen the disastrous path blazed out by the Bolsheviks 90 years ago. N...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a valuation {{model for a}} <b>perpetual</b> convertible <b>bond</b> when the price dynamics of the underlying share are governed by continuous-time Markovian regime-switching models. We suppose that the appreciation rate and the volatility of the underlying share are modulated by a continuous-time, finite-state, observable Markov chain. The states of this chain are interpreted as the states of an economy. Here the valuation problem of the <b>perpetual</b> convertible <b>bond</b> {{can be viewed as}} that of valuing a <b>perpetual</b> stock loan, <b>or</b> a <b>perpetual</b> American option with time-dependent strike price. With the presence of the regime-switching effect, the market in the model is, in general, incomplete. To provide a convenient method to determine a price kernel for valuation, we employ the regime-switching Esscher transform introduced in Elliott, Chan and Siu (2005) [4]. We then adopt the differential equation approach in Guo and Zhang (2004) [7] to solve the optimal stopping problem associated with the valuation of the <b>perpetual</b> convertible <b>bond.</b> Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the practical implementation of the proposed model. © 2009 Academic Publications. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

This paper proposes a measure of corporate vulnerability, the Corporate Vulnerability Index (CVI) and analyses whether it can explain the probability and severity of recessions. The CVI is constructed as the default probability for the entire corporate sector, using the model of corporate debt by Anderson, Sundaresan, and Tychon (1996). The CVI is {{shown to be a}} significant predictor of the probability of a recession 4 to 6 quarters ahead, even controlling for other leading indicators. An increase in the CVI is also associated with an increase in the probability of a more severe and lengthy recession 3 to 6 quarters ahead.
