30|$|Aromatic {{oxidation}} requires {{large amounts}} of heat {{to be removed from}} the reaction zone to maintain the temperature and keep the overall process under control. An <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>reaction</b> would cause a severe reduction of yields (complete combustion would be favored) as well as the loss of catalyst life [23]. Furthermore, it is a self-amplifying problem, i.e., an increase in temperature causes more combustion reactions that would further increase the temperature. Proper reactor design and heat management are therefore key aspects in industrial processes. Reaction at near-isothermal conditions is preferred to maintain optimal catalyst efficiency and product selectivity. Multitubular reactors and fluidized beds with heat exchange internals have been widely used for this purpose; after all, these configurations are suitable to minimize the temperature gradients across the catalyst bed.|$|E

The shift to higher space-time yields, higher temperatures, and a confined reaction volume comprises new risks, such as runaway reactions, decomposition, and incomplete conversion of reactants. Simplified spreadsheet calculations enable an estimation of the expected temperature profiles, conversion rates, and consequences of potential malfunction based on the reaction kinetics. The analysis illustrates that the range of optimal reaction conditions is almost congruent with the danger of an <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>reaction.</b> The risk of a spontaneous reaction with hot spots can be presumed if strong exothermic reactions are carried out in micro-designed reactors.

40|$|Autoinflammatory syndroms {{comprise}} {{a group of}} diseases characterized by <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>reactions</b> of the innate immune system. Currently, four monogenic autoinflammatory disorders are described: (i) cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS), (ii) familial mediterranean fever (FMF), (iii) TNF receptor-associated syndrome (TRAPS) and (iv) Hyper-IgD yndrom (HIDS). Clinically, these disorders are characterized by recurrent inflammatory reactions, associated by fever attacks, exanthema, serositis, myalgia/myositis and others. The chronic inflammatory reaction might lead to the deposit of amyloid. This work describes the following new aspects of the clinical picture of autoinflammatory diseases: (i) environmental factors influences the phenotypical outcome of FMF, (ii) oligosymptomatic courses of TRAPS might hamper the early diagnosis of this threatening disease and (iii) an uncommon phenotype-genotype correlation. As a new diagnostical tool for the primary diagnosis of autoinflammatory disorders as well as the inflammation monitoring S- 100 molecules are introduced. Aspects of measuring the correct body temperature – a hallmark in the diagnosis of autoinflammtory disordes – are discussed.

Proper management of the hazards can reduce, but not eliminate, the possibility of undesirable changes.

40|$|International audienceThe origin(s) and role(s) {{of metal}} soaps in paints are a {{worldwide}} concern today. These hybrid compounds, containing both fatty acid chains and metals {{associated with a}} carboxylate function, are increasingly identified in paints. As reviewed {{in the first part}} of this work, the presence of metal soaps in paints is differently interpreted in scientific publications: metal soaps are sometimes considered to play a positive role as anchor points, during paint drying processes; they can also be considered as responsible for many degradation processes (protrusions, efflorescences, darkening, etc.). Their origins are also interpreted in various ways. In some paintings (in particular from the twentieth century), they have sometimes introduced on purpose, as additives, to modify the physical properties of the painting materials. In older paintings, metal soaps are usually thought to result from an <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>reaction</b> of oil with lead-based pigments, in particular lead white, red lead, and lead tin yellow. In the second part of this work, the review of historical recipes of lead-based paint shows an important number of recipes based on controlled mixing of oil with lead driers. In the third part, the experimental reproduction of such traditional recipes using walnut oil and litharge (PbO) shows that lead soaps can be formed, both in about one hour at ∼ 100 °C, or in about one month at room temperature. It shows as well that after a few years, litharge is no longer detected in the paint medium, while different lead carbonates are. Finally, the micro-infrared spectroscopy and micro-X-ray diffraction re-analysis of protrusions from a nine-year model painting shows together with lead soaps, the presence of Pb 5 (CO 3) 3 (OH) 2 O (‘synthetic plumbonacrite’), an unusual phase recently observed in a protrusion from a painting by Vincent Van Gogh. This work highlights (i) the multiple origins and roles of metal soaps in paints and (ii) the importance of combining the analysis of fragments from historical paintings with the analysis and reproduction of historical recipes. In particular, we show that the components detected today in historical paintings may severely differ from those originally used or prepared by the painter, complicating the assessment of the painter's intentions. More than the presence of metal soaps, the key questions to be tackled should be about their origins and (re) mobilization...|$|E

40|$|A new {{divergent}} methodology {{to prepare}} a variety of dendritic polymers containing dimethylsilyl-linked- 3, 5 -dihydroxybenzyl alcohol units in the backbone is reported. This simple and versatile synthetic route {{is based on the}} acid-base hydrolytic chemistry of 3, 5 -dihydroxybenzyl alcohol (DHBA) and dimethyldiaminosilane Me 2 Si(NMe 2) 2. Controlled sequential addition of reactants was used to prepare dendrimer generations 1 [...] 5. The dendritic growth was found to be dictated by a preferential attack of the benzylic hydroxyl group of DHBA on the aminosilane, as no traces of residual benzylic OH groups were observed using 1 H NMR spectroscopy. By a continuation of this divergent route, these dendrimers were functionalized with a variety of terminal units, including trimethylsilyl, n-octanoate, organic dye disperse red 1, and hydroxypropyldiphenylphosphine. <b>Uncontrolled</b> <b>reaction</b> protocols using the same reacting partners were also investigated to prepare the corresponding hyperbranched polymers. Resulting macromolecules showed structural fragments ranging from that of dendrimer generation 1 to that of dendrimer generation 2 in their MALDI-TOF mass spectra. Addition of more reactants did not seem to increase the size of these hyperbranched polymers. Determination of some of the structure-property relationships in these dendrimers was carried out to obtain a better understanding of their potential applications. Hydrolytic stability of the dendrimers was examined using dendrimer generations 1 [...] 3 solvated in wet DMSO. Their resistance towards hydrolysis was found to increase with an increase in generation number. Intrinsic viscosities were determined for dendrimer generations 1 [...] 5. A non-linear relationship was found between the generation number and the intrinsic viscosity, as it reached a maximum for dendrimer generation 4, followed by a decrease. 3, 5 -dihydroxybenzyl alcohol based dendrimers were found to self-assemble via hydrogen bonding between terminally situated hydroxyl groups. This phenomenon was found to be dependent on their concentration in solution, and a critical aggregation concentration was determined at 3. 7 mg mL- 1 for dendrimer generations 1 [...] 3. Higher generation dendrimers showed aggregate formation at low concentrations as the number of peripheral OH groups was significantly increased. By functionalizing dendrimers and hyperbranched polymers with hydroxypropyldiphenylphosphine ligands, followed by coordination with [Rh(COD) Cl], we were able to synthesize metallodendrimers and organometallic hyperbranched polymers, in which active organometallic fragments are present at the periphery. Their catalytic activity was assessed in hydrogenation of 1 -decene. Conversion rates of decene into decane for metallodendrimers were found to be dependent on the time of reaction and the generation number. Maximum conversion rates were found after 5 h reaction time in each case...|$|E
40|$|Matrix {{acidizing}} {{is used in}} carbonate formations {{to create}} wormholes that connect the formation to the wellbore. Hydrochloric acid, organic acids, or mixtures of these acids are typically used in matrix acidizing treatments of carbonate reservoirs. However, {{the use of these}} acids in deep wells has some major drawbacks including high and <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>reaction</b> rate and corrosion to well tubulars, especially those made of chrome-based tubulars (Cr- 13 and duplex steel), and these problems become severe at high temperatures. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) and its based fluids have a major drawback in stimulating shallow (low fracture gradient) formations as they may cause face dissolution (formation surface washout) if injected at low rates. The objective of stimulation of sandstone reservoirs is to remove the damage caused to the production zone during drilling or completion operations. Many problems may occur during sandstone acidizing with Hydrochloric/Hydrofluoric acids (HCl/HF) mud acid. Among those problems: decomposition of clays in HCl acids, precipitation of fluosilicates, the presence of carbonate can cause the precipitation of calcium fluorides, silica-gel filming, colloidal silica-gel precipitation, and mixing between various stages of the treatment. To overcome problems associated with strong acids, chelating agents were introduced and used in the field. However, major concerns with most of these chemicals are their limited dissolving power and negative environmental impact. Glutamic acid diacetic acid (GLDA) a newly developed environmentally friendly chelate was examined as stand-alone stimulation fluid in deep oil and gas wells. In this study we used GLDA to stimulate carbonate cores (calcite and dolomite). GLDA was also used to stimulate and remove the damage from different sandstone cores containing different compositions of clay minerals. Carbonate cores (calcite and dolomite) of 6 and 20 in. length and 1. 5 in. diameter were used in the coreflood experiments. Coreflood experiments were run at temperatures ranging from 180 to 300 oF. Ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA), hydroxyl ethylethylene diaminetriacetic acid (HEDTA), and GLDA were used to stimulate and remove the damage from different sandstone cores at high temperatures. X-ray Computed Topography (CT) scans were used to determine the effectiveness of these fluids in stimulation calcite and dolomite cores and removing the damage from sandstone cores. The sandstone cores used in this study contain from 1 to 18 wt percent illite (swellable and migratable clay mineral). GLDA was found to be highly effective in creating wormholes over a wide range of pH (1. 7 - 13) in calcite cores. Increasing temperature enhanced the reaction rate, more calcite was dissolved, and larger wormholes were formed for different pH with smaller volumes of GLDA solutions. GLDA has a prolonged activity and leads to a decreased surface spending resulting in face dissolution and therefore acts deeper in the formation. In addition, GLDA was very effective in creating wormholes in the dolomite core as it is a good chelate for magnesium. Coreflood experiments showed that at high pH values (pH = 11) GLDA, HEDTA, and EDTA were almost the same in increasing the permeability of both Berea and Bandera sandstone cores. GLDA, HEDTA, and EDTA were compatible with Bandera sandstone cores which contains 10 wt percent Illite. The weight loss from the core was highest in case of HEDTA and lowest in case of GLDA at pH 11. At low pH values (pH = 4) 0. 6 M GLDA performed better than 0. 6 M HEDTA in the coreflood experiments. The permeability ratio (final/initial) for Bandera sandstone cores was 2 in the case of GLDA and 1. 2 in the case of HEDTA at pH of 4 and 300 oF. At high pH HEDTA was the best chelating agent to stimulate different sandstone cores, and at low pH GLDA was the best one. For Berea sandstone cores EDTA at high pH of 11 was the best in increasing the permeability of the core at 300 oF. The low pH GLDA based fluid has been especially designed for high temperature oil well stimulation in carbonate and sandstone rock. Extensive studies have proved that GLDA effectively created wormholes in carbonate cores, is gentle to most types of casing including Cr-based tubular, has a high thermal stability and gives no unwanted interactions with carbonate or sandstone formations. These unique properties ensure that it can be safely used under extreme conditions for which the current technologies do not give optimal results. Furthermore, this stimulation fluid contributes to a sustainable future as it based on readily biodegradable GLDA that is made from natural and renewable raw material...|$|E
