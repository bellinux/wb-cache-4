40|$|The US Department of Energy, Carlsbad Area Office (DOE-CAO) has {{completed}} a voluntary release assessment sampling program at selected Solid Waste Management Units (SWMUs) at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). This Voluntary Release Assessment/Corrective Action (RA/CA) report has {{been prepared for}} final submittal to the Environmental protection Agency (EPA) Region 6, Hazardous Waste Management Division and the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) Hazardous and Radioactive Materials Bureau to describe the results of voluntary release assessment sampling and proposed corrective actions at the SWMU sites. The Voluntary RA/CA Program {{is intended to be}} the first phase in implementing the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Facility Investigation (RFI) and corrective action process at the WIPP. Data generated as part of this sampling program are intended to update the RCRA Facility Assessment (RFA) for the WIPP (Assessment of Solid Waste Management Units at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant), NMED/DOE/AIP 94 / 1. This Final Voluntary RA/CA Report documents the results of release assessment sampling at 11 SWMUs identified in the RFA. With this submittal, DOE formally requests a No Further Action determination for these SWMUs. Additionally, this report provides information to support DOE`s request for No Further Action at the Brinderson and Construction landfill SWMUs, and to support DOE`s request for approval of proposed corrective actions at three other SWMUs (the Badger <b>Unit</b> <b>Drill</b> Pad, the Cotton Baby Drill Pad, and the DOE- 1 Drill Pad). This information is provided to document the results of the Voluntary RA/CA activities submitted to the EPA and NMED in August 1995...|$|E
40|$|This field manual {{provides}} guidance for Armywide uniformity {{in the conduct}} of drill and ceremonies. It includes methods of instructing drill, teaching techniques, individual and <b>unit</b> <b>drill,</b> manual of arms for infantry weapons, and various other aspects of basic drill instruction. This manual is designed for use by soldiers of all military occupational skills, to include the new soldier in the initial entry training environment. Since exact procedures covering all situations or eventualities pertaining to drill and ceremonies cannot be foreseen, commanders may find it necessary to adjust the procedures to local conditions. However, with the view toward maintaining consistency throughout the Army, the procedures prescribed herein should be adhered to as closely as possible. Personnel preparing to give drill instruction must be thoroughly familiar with Chapters 1 through 5 before attempting to teach material in Chapters 6 and 7. For ease in distinguishing a preparatory command from a command of execution, the commands of execution are printed in BOLD CAP letters and preparatory commands are printed in Bold Italic letters. Reference to positions and movements are printed in italics. A reference diagram for symbols used in illustrations appears in Appendix B. AR 670 - 1 should be used as a reference for the proper wearing of uniforms and insignia. Users of this manual are encouraged to submit recommendations to improve the publication. Comments should be keyed to the page, paragraph, and line(s) of the text where a change is recommended. Reasons should be provided for each comment to insure understanding and complete evaluation.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present the}} {{development}} of an innovative device (Stem Cell Harvesting Manipulator) to get a donor’s hematopoietic stem cells for bone marrow transplantation with minimal puncture. In this paper, we report {{the development of}} a prototype of the manipulator with Flexible <b>Drilling</b> <b>Unit.</b> The manipulator is inserted into the medullary space from the iliac crest and aspirates the cells while an end-mill on the tip of the Flexible <b>Drilling</b> <b>Unit</b> <b>drills</b> through cancellous bone to create a curved path. We found that the manipulator could be inserted into the pig iliac bone 131 mm by 32. 1 mm/min. Moreover, the number of harvested nucleated cells per puncture is 6. 04 times more than the Aspiration Method. The Aspiration Method, however, could harvest much (3. 73 times) denser graft than our method. Further consideration regarding whether or not this device can harvest viable hematopoietic stem cells should be considere...|$|R

It officially came into existence on 30 April 1860 and was numbered as the 40th Middlesex Rifle Volunteer Corps. It was included in the 3rd Administrative Battalion of Middlesex RVCs. The <b>unit</b> <b>drilled</b> in the precincts of Gray's Inn and the headquarters (HQ) was established first at Field Court and then at South Square at Gray's Inn.|$|R
