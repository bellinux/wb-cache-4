5|$|Underwater {{camouflage}} is the set {{of methods}} of achieving crypsis—avoidance of observation—that allows otherwise visible aquatic organisms to remain <b>unnoticed</b> <b>by</b> other organisms such as predators or prey.|$|E
5|$|Burnett's subversive {{activities}} {{did not go}} <b>unnoticed</b> <b>by</b> {{his colleagues}} in Congress. He was absent when the body reconvened December 2, 1861. The following day, Indiana representative W. McKee Dunn introduced a resolution to expel Burnett from Congress. The resolution passed easily, removing Burnett from the seat he had occupied continuously since 1855.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of Heavy Metal and American Pop, Warner Bros. became excited about the second version of Hey Good Lookin, forming a {{specialty}} division for the film's distribution. The film opened in New York City on October 1, 1982, and was released in Los Angeles in January 1983. Although it went largely <b>unnoticed</b> <b>by</b> the American public, it received respectable business in foreign markets.|$|E
50|$|Except {{for a few}} Latin and Greek loan-words, these {{differences}} are <b>unnoticed</b> even <b>by</b> native speakers; the words have been entirely adopted into the Hungarian lexicon. There are {{an increasing number of}} English loan-words, especially in technical fields.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Woodward and Linda {{looked at}} her, but Charley did not, and her blunder passed <b>by</b> <b>unnoticed.</b>|$|R
60|$|Twenty minutes later, Prince Blank stepped hurriedly {{across the}} platform, <b>unnoticed</b> save <b>by</b> {{half a dozen}} obsequious officials, and entered the {{compartment}} reserved for him. The obsequious officials bowed. Prince Blank, in military fashion, raised his hand. The 6.40 steamed out slowly.|$|R
5|$|The Sermons, a {{political}} treatise composed {{in the guise}} of sermons, went almost <b>unnoticed</b> <b>by</b> contemporaries. In the Sermons, Skarga discusses what he sees as the problems of the ailing Commonwealth: lack of patriotism, internal quarrels, tolerance of heretics, the king's relative powerlessness, perverse laws (a critique of the nobility's Golden Freedoms), and immorality. Another notable aspect of the book is its focus on the desperate plight of the serfs (the peasants).|$|E
5|$|The demands made on Beatrice {{during her}} mother's reign were high. Despite {{suffering}} from rheumatism, Beatrice {{was forced to}} endure her mother's love of cold weather. Beatrice's piano playing suffered as her rheumatism got gradually worse, eliminating an enjoyment in which she excelled; however, this did not change her willingness to cater to her mother's needs. Her effort did not go <b>unnoticed</b> <b>by</b> the British public.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect that}} seamounts have on fish populations {{has not gone}} <b>unnoticed</b> <b>by</b> the {{commercial}} fishing industry. Seamounts were first extensively fished {{in the second half}} of the 20th century, due to poor management practices and increased fishing pressure seriously depleting stock numbers on the typical fishing ground, the continental shelf. Seamounts have been the site of targeted fishing since that time.|$|E
50|$|Shortly after noon, a coal car {{filled with}} hay for the mules caught fire {{from one of}} the wall lanterns.Initially <b>unnoticed</b> and, <b>by</b> some accounts, ignored by the workers, efforts to move the fire only spread the blaze to the timbers {{supporting}} the mine.|$|R

50|$|Music {{rehearsal}} {{spaces are}} concerned with talent development. As most commercially operated spaces are small, localised and not networked, their overall economic significance goes <b>unnoticed,</b> over-shadowed <b>by</b> the larger economic force of the corporate live and recorded music sectors. The value of the physical space to music-making can often be overlooked in favour of the creative process.|$|R
5|$|A {{drawback}} to {{the device was}} found on 7 March 1948, when the firebox crown sheet of Princess Alexandra, a Coronation Pacific of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, failed while hauling a passenger train from Glasgow to London. Enquiries established that both water gauges were defective and on a journey earlier that day {{one or both of}} the fusible plugs had melted, but this had gone <b>unnoticed</b> <b>by</b> the engine crew because of the strong draught carrying the escaping steam away from them.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{companies}} want to retain creative {{control over their}} intellectual properties and are wary of fan-created works, like fan fiction. However, because machinima provides free marketing, they have avoided a response demanding strict copyright enforcement. In 2003, Linden Lab was praised for changing license terms to allow users to retain ownership of works created in its virtual world Second Life. Rooster Teeth initially tried to release Red vs. Blue <b>unnoticed</b> <b>by</b> Halos owners because they feared that any communication would force them to end the project. However, Microsoft, Bungie's parent company at the time, contacted the group shortly after episode 2, and allowed them to continue without paying licensing fees.|$|E
5|$|In {{northern}} France, men {{and resources}} were being marshalled {{in preparation for}} the large British-French Somme Offensive. The build-up in the Somme did not go <b>unnoticed</b> <b>by</b> the German Supreme Army Command. The German Second Army, which was holding the sector north of the Somme, had observed preparations for an offensive since the end of February 1916. Short of resources due to operations at Verdun, the Germans could only mount local operations in an effort to divert British resources from the Somme.|$|E
5000|$|... "Jones the Rhythm", {{the second}} and the last single, was {{released}} {{at the end of}} the year, but passed <b>unnoticed,</b> overshadowed <b>by</b> the success of the first single and the release of the Island Life compilation. It suffered from lack of promotion, as no music video was produced for it and it has never been performed live.|$|R

50|$|Periodic {{inspection}} {{is especially}} important for cords that may be used in place for a long time, for instance behind furniture, where damage may go <b>unnoticed</b> and <b>by</b> chance conditions are right for a fire or electrical shock incident to occur (e.g. some dust or paper falls near the arcing wire, or a liquid spill occurs and flows to the exposed wire).|$|R
5|$|Nova rooted for the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball and the Leones del Escogido of the Dominican Professional Baseball League as a child. He played {{baseball}} as a shortstop and outfielder, {{but was not}} highly regarded as a prospect. He went <b>unnoticed</b> <b>by</b> scouts until he experienced a growth spurt {{at the age of}} 15. Local scouts asked Nova to pitch in a game against older players, and he continued to train as a pitcher.|$|E
5|$|The threats {{faced by}} seabirds {{have not gone}} <b>unnoticed</b> <b>by</b> {{scientists}} or the conservation movement. As early as 1903, U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt was convinced {{of the need to}} declare Pelican Island in Florida a National Wildlife Refuge to protect the bird colonies (including the nesting brown pelicans), and in 1909 he protected the Farallon Islands. Today many important seabird colonies are given some measure of protection, from Heron Island in Australia to Triangle Island in British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|Tourette's {{is defined}} {{as part of a}} {{spectrum}} of tic disorders, which includes provisional, transient and persistent (chronic) tics. While the exact cause is unknown, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. There are no specific tests for diagnosing Tourette's; it is not always correctly identified because most cases are mild and the severity of tics decreases for most children as they pass through adolescence. Extreme Tourette's in adulthood, though sensationalized in the media, is a rarity; tics are often <b>unnoticed</b> <b>by</b> casual observers.|$|E
60|$|The {{cases of}} those who are {{unprepared}} at a recitation, ought, by no means, to be passed <b>by,</b> <b>unnoticed,</b> although it would be unwise to spend much time in examining each, in detail.|$|R
50|$|She {{arrives on}} her first day as the ER is {{undergoing}} major renovations and is {{for the most part}} <b>unnoticed,</b> except <b>by</b> Dr. Michael Gallant, who guides her through the rough start in the hospital, and Dr. Greg Pratt, who flirts a little bit with her. Neela is very intelligent but sometimes stumbles in her doctor-patient communications skills. This proves disastrous when she informs the wrong woman of her grandson's death.|$|R
50|$|It is this provincial, often unappreciated and <b>unnoticed</b> architecture, <b>by</b> nationally unknown architects {{still being}} {{produced}} today {{which continues to}} give many English market towns their unique atmosphere and character, the architecture of Aylesbury demonstrates this admirably Aylesbury retains some buildings from the medieval, Stuart, Georgian and Victorian periods, {{as well as the}} 20th century. Ceely House, Ardenham House, the Union Workhouse and The County Gaol are among the most notable buildings in the town.|$|R
5|$|Around 52 {{minutes and}} 47 seconds into the film, when Shatner {{is talking about}} the other Original Series actors disliking him, he shifts in his chair and a sound evocative of {{flatulence}} is audible. This sound, apparently <b>unnoticed</b> <b>by</b> the filmmakers, was first mentioned in the media by Adam Buckman in the New York Post on October 10, 2001. Buckman wrote that he played the sound for more than six colleagues who all agreed that it came from Shatner. This scene became a popular subject of flatulence humor among Star Trek fans and on morning zoo radio programs. Reviewers identified as many as six other similar noises in Mind Meld, between the 52-minute mark and the end.|$|E
5|$|On 5 October, an operationally unnamed {{subtropical}} storm {{which had}} gone <b>unnoticed</b> <b>by</b> the NHC was absorbed by a temperate frontal low, which {{was moving to}} the southeast over the Azores. The low pressure system gained a more concentrated circulation and lost its frontal structure after absorbing the subtropical storm. The developing system became a subtropical storm itself early on 8 October 580miles (930km) southeast of Lajes in the Azores. However, the NHC decided not to name the system Vince at the time, because the water temperature was too low for normal development for a tropical cyclone. The storm gradually gained the tropical characteristics of symmetry and a warm inner core and became a tropical storm the next day. Its transformation to a tropical system occurred over water cooler than 24°C (75°F), much colder than the 26.5°C (80°F) usually required for tropical development.|$|E
5|$|The aphid {{that was}} the central source of the damage in France was first noted {{following}} the growing of the European vine Vitis vinifera by French colonists in Florida, in the 16th century. These plantations were a failure, and later experiments with related species of vine also failed, although the reason for these failures {{appears to have been}} a mystery to the French colonists. It is known today that it was a species of North American grape phylloxera that caused these early vineyards to fail; the venom injected by the Phylloxera causes a disease that is quickly fatal to the European varieties of vine. The aphids initially went <b>unnoticed</b> <b>by</b> the colonists, despite their great numbers, and the pressure to successfully start a vineyard in America at the time.|$|E
50|$|Days {{before the}} May 16 attack in Casablanca, el-Mejjati is {{believed}} to have fled to Spain. Arguments that he had dressed as a woman to travel <b>unnoticed</b> were rebuffed <b>by</b> his wife who pointed out he stood 6'4".|$|R

50|$|De Vrij's strong {{development}} at Feyenoord {{did not pass}} <b>by</b> <b>unnoticed,</b> as he quickly received his first invitation for a national youth team. On 21 November 2007, the Netherlands U16 won the friendly match against Ukraine U16 (1-0), with De Vrij's first appearance in the starting line-up.|$|R
5|$|The large, mostly {{spontaneous}} gatherings at Truman's whistle-stop {{events were}} an important {{sign of a}} change in momentum in the campaign, but this shift went virtually <b>unnoticed</b> <b>by</b> the national press corps. It continued reporting Republican Thomas Dewey's apparent impending victory as a certainty. One reason for the press's inaccurate projection was that polls were conducted primarily by telephone, but many people, including much of Truman's populist base, did not yet own a telephone. This skewed the data to indicate a stronger support base for Dewey than existed. An unintended and undetected projection error {{may have contributed to the}} perception of Truman's bleak chances. The three major polling organizations stopped polling well before the November 2 election date—Roper in September, and Crossley and Gallup in October—thus failing to measure the period when Truman appears to have surged past Dewey.|$|E
5|$|After {{he wrote}} the pilot, he {{approached}} actors for the main characters. Christopher Eccleston was Davies' first choice {{for the role of}} Stuart Jones; Eccleston declined because of his age and suggested his friend Aidan Gillen instead. The roles of Vince Tyler and Nathan Maloney were quickly given to Craig Kelly and Charlie Hunnam, and the secondary character Alexander Perry, originally written for the television producer Phil Collinson during his brief acting career, was portrayed by Antony Cotton, who later played the gay character Sean Tully in Coronation Street. The series was allocated a £3,000,000 budget, and was produced by Red Productions, owned by his friend and former colleague Nicola Shindler, and filmed by Cracker and Hillsborough director Charles McDougall and The Grand director Sarah Hardin on location in Manchester. The eight 40-minute episodes emulated experiences from his social life and includes an episode where the minor character Phil Delaney (Jason Merrells) dies of a cocaine overdose, <b>unnoticed</b> <b>by</b> his social circle.|$|E
5|$|Baroš joined Premier League side Portsmouth on {{loan from}} Lyon in January 2008 {{until the end of}} the season, with the option of making the move {{permanent}} at the end of the loan. Baroš played a significant role in the club winning the 2008 FA Cup. He won Portsmouth's match-winning penalty kick in the quarter-final at Manchester United and assisted Nwankwo Kanu's deciding goal in the semi final match against West Bromwich Albion with a suspected handball that went <b>unnoticed</b> <b>by</b> both the referee and his assistant. The final match of Baroš' loan spell was the 2008 FA Cup Final victory over Cardiff City at Wembley Stadium, where he appeared as an 87th-minute substitute for Kanu. By the end of the season, Baroš had played 16 matches for Portsmouth, including seven as a substitute, although he failed to score. He was one of a number of Portsmouth players to be absent at the team parade after the club won the FA Cup, leading to speculation he could have played his last game for the club. At the end of the season, Baroš returned to Lyon.|$|E
40|$|Current {{philosophical}} {{studies of}} the implications of a "minimalist" theory of truth reveal how problems otherwise <b>unnoticed</b> are arisen <b>by</b> the issue of true or false. As catalyzer of linguistic problems, this issue appears even today as a dark mirror wherein language reflects its profound enigmas and unavoidable uncertainties...|$|R
50|$|Later, in the mid-90s, {{the series}} {{had a brief}} afterlife airing {{overnights}} on the now defunct Network One (N1). The episodes were five minutes in length, including end credits. Many of which were expansions of their two-minute counterparts from Fox Kids. Some combined two two-minute shorts to make a five-minute double episode with bridges either at the beginning, middle or end of each story, or a combination thereof. Due to {{the limited number of}} indie and low-powered stations that carried Network One, the series aired nearly <b>unnoticed</b> except <b>by</b> night owls.|$|R
50|$|Problems {{occur if}} {{a change in}} the system state happens <b>unnoticed</b> (initiated <b>by</b> the system, or by another person, such as the user who was {{previously}} using the machine), or if after some time the user forgets about the state change. Another typical problem is a sudden change of state that interrupts a user's activity, such as focus stealing. In such a situation it can easily happen that the user does some operations with the old state in mind, while the brain has not yet fully processed the signals indicating the state change.|$|R
