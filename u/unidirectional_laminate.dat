40|$|A {{review of}} some {{approximate}} analytical models for damaged, {{fiber reinforced composite}} materials is presented. Using the classical shear lag stress displacement assumption, solutions are presented for a <b>unidirectional</b> <b>laminate</b> containing a notch, a rectangular cut-out, and a circular hole.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The article {{investigates the}} damping of {{unidirectional}} glass fiber composites {{with a single}} or two interleaved viscoelastic layers. The experimental damping characteristics are derived from flexural vibrations of cantilever beams {{as a function of}} the fiber orientation. The experimental results are analyzed considering the modeling developed in a previous article, Berthelot, J. -M. Damping Analysis of Orthotropic Composites with Interleaved Viscoelastic Layers Modelling, Journal of Composite Materials (in press). The analysis considers the variations of Young’s modulus and damping of viscoelastic layers with the frequency. Finally, the article presents the effects of Young’s modulus and the damping of a viscoelastic layer interleaved in the middle plane of <b>unidirectional</b> <b>laminate.</b> The results are also reported for the case of external viscoelastic layers.

40|$|Abstract. A {{cumulative}} damage model, which {{is able to}} consider the influence of in plane bi-axial stresses and mean stresses on the fatigue behavior of <b>unidirectional</b> <b>laminates,</b> {{was used to evaluate}} the fatigue lives of multidirectional laminates under cyclic shear loadings, with the least requirement for the S-N curves of <b>unidirectional</b> <b>laminates</b> corresponding to the three in-plane on-axis stress components separately. An Iosipescu-type of fixture, which had been previously used for the static shear strength tests of <b>unidirectional</b> <b>laminates</b> or metal materials, was proved useful for the shear fatigue tests of multidirectional laminates. Together with finite element stress analysis, {{cumulative damage}} modes and their distribution regions on T 300 /QY 8911 shear fatigue specimens were reasonably simulated and the predicted lives agree well with the test results...|$|R

40|$|Different angle {{brackets}} for anchoring solid wooden panels were tested {{to learn about}} their response and basic mechanical properties on the acting load in two perpendicular directions. Namely, previous tests showed two distinct cases of panel deformation. In one case the panel mainly rotates around its compressed corner. In the other case the panel slips along foundation and deforms into parallelogram shape. Based on this knowledge, the tests were designed to simulate these two cases of deformation.

In order to study the fatigue behavior, stiffness degradation has been studied as well as the strength degradation and a driftnet model has been proposed for each of them.

40|$|The {{stiffness}} {{of a flat}} specimen, made of graphite epoxy (T 300 / 934), was measured during reverse fatigue loading. Laminates of basic layup, unidirectional cross-ply and angle-ply, as well as multidirectional (isotropic) layup, were tested. It was found that all the laminates exhibit rapid stiffness degradation on the last (third) fatigue stage. Except for the 0 -deg <b>unidirectional</b> <b>laminate,</b> the last stage starts at about 70 to 80 percent of the fatigue life, regardless of the load level and the final mode of failure (tension or compression). It is shown that, for this material, stiffness degradation {{is a result of}} crack accumulation, mainly along the fibers, even for the fiber dominated laminates. This general phenomenon can serve to predict usable safe life of laminates under fatigue loading...|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} has been {{estimated}} the compressive strength of a unidirectional lamina of a carbon/epoxy composite material, using the cross-ply and angle-ply laminates. Over the years various methods {{have been developed to}} deduce compressive properties of composite materials reinforced with long fibres. Each of these methods is characterized by a specific way of applying load to the specimen. The method chosen to perform the compression tests is the Wyoming Combined Loading Compression (CLC) Test Method, described in ASTM D 6641 / D 6641 M- 09. This method presents many advantages, especially: the load application on the specimen (end load combined with shear load), the reproducibility of measurements and the experimental equipment quite simplified. Six different laminates were tested in compressive tests. They were realized by the same unidirectional prepreg, but with different stacking sequences: two cross-ply [0 / 90]ns, two angle-ply [0 / 90 /± 45]ns and two <b>unidirectional</b> <b>laminates</b> [0]ns and [90]ns. The estimate of the compressive strength of the <b>unidirectional</b> <b>laminates</b> at 0 °, was done by an indirect analytical method, developed from the classical lamination theory, and which uses a multiplicative parameter known as Back-out Factor (BF). The BF is determined by using the experimental values obtained from compression tests...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study to determine}} the effects of thermal cycling on residual mechanical properties of a graphite/polyimide composite has been conducted. Interlaminar shear, flexure and compression strengths were measured at room temperature and 316 C on unidirectional and quasi-isotropic laminates subjected to 150 and 500 thermal cycles between - 156 C and 316 C. Thermal cycling produced transverse microcracks and delaminations in the laminates. The linear density of the microcracks (35 /cm) was about the same after 150 and 500 cycles. Although the crack density did not change from 150 to 500 cycles, crack growth did occur with intralamina cracks growing into adjacent lamina. The matrix controlled properties of the quasi-isotropic laminate at both room temperature and 316 C were significantly reduced by thermal cycling. However, the properties of the <b>unidirectional</b> <b>laminate</b> were significantly reduced only at 316 C...|$|E

INTRODUCTION Nonlinear elastic moduli are important physical properties in conventional materials. They provide information about the interatomic bonding forces in crystalline solids. Nonlinear properties are also important in the nondestructive determination of applied and residual stress (strain) and several investigations have also established a possible relationship between nonlinear elastic properties and ultimate strength in aluminum and carbon steel [1, 2]. Conventional mechanical testing does not have sufficient sensitivity to measure the nonlinearity in the mechanical behavior in most materia [...] ...|$|E
