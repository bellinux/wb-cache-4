5|$|Skeptics of New World Order {{conspiracy}} theories accuse its proponents of indulging in the furtive fallacy, {{a belief that}} significant facts of history are necessarily sinister; conspiracism, a world view that centrally places {{conspiracy theories}} in the <b>unfolding</b> <b>of</b> history, rather than social and economic forces; and fusion paranoia, a promiscuous absorption of fears from any source whatsoever.|$|E
5|$|Earlier in 2017 Puw {{completed}} his first chamber opera Y Tŵr {{based on the}} play by the Welsh playwright, Gwenlyn Parry and to libretto by Gwyneth Glyn. The opera in three acts explores the relationship and emotions between two characters during three specific periods in their lives, during youth, middle age and finally, old age. The composer's use of atonal musical language, octatonic scales and the occasional tonal passage are directly linked with the various emotions of the characters and the <b>unfolding</b> <b>of</b> the drama.|$|E

5|$|The {{mechanism}} for <b>unfolding</b> <b>of</b> globular proteins is necessarily general, but somewhat {{dependent on the}} amino acid sequence. Long sequences of alternating glycine and alanine {{have been shown to}} inhibit substrate unfolding, decreasing the efficiency of proteasomal degradation; this results in the release of partially degraded byproducts, possibly due to the decoupling of the ATP hydrolysis and unfolding steps. Such glycine-alanine repeats are also found in nature, for example in silk fibroin; in particular, certain Epstein–Barr virus gene products bearing this sequence can stall the proteasome, helping the virus propagate by preventing antigen presentation on the major histocompatibility complex.|$|E
5|$|In 1844, the Scottish {{publisher}} Robert Chambers anonymously {{published an}} extremely controversial but widely read book entitled Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation. This book proposed an evolutionary scenario for {{the origins of}} the Solar System and of life on Earth. It claimed that the fossil record showed a progressive ascent of animals, with current animals branching off a main line that leads progressively to humanity. It implied that the transmutations lead to the <b>unfolding</b> <b>of</b> a preordained plan that had been woven into the laws that governed the universe. In this sense it was less completely materialistic than the ideas of radicals like Grant, but its implication that humans were only the last step in the ascent of animal life incensed many conservative thinkers. The high profile of the public debate over Vestiges, with its depiction of evolution as a progressive process, would greatly influence the perception of Darwin's theory a decade later.|$|E
