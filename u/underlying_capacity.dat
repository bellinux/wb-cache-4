Because transcultural competence, as defined in the MLA Report (2007), shares much of its <b>underlying</b> <b>capacities</b> with reading ability, in principle, reading instruction could {{play a significant role}} in fostering transcultural competence.

Recent controversy over evolution of extreme sexual size dimorphism (SSD) in spiders centres {{on the relationship}} between size and locomotor capacity in males. Advantages for large males running over horizontal surfaces and small males climbing vertically have been proposed. Models have implicitly treated running and climbing as functionally distinct activities and failed to consider the possibility that they reflect common <b>underlying</b> <b>capacities.</b> Findings We examine the relationship between maximum climbing and running {{performance in}} males of three spider species. Maximum running and climbing speeds were positively related in two orb-web spiders with high SSD (Argiope keyserlingi and Nephila plumipes), indicating that for these species assays of running and climbing largely reveal the same <b>underlying</b> <b>capacities.</b> Running and climbing speeds were not related in a jumping spider with low SSD (Jacksonoides queenslandica). We found no evidence of a performance trade-off between these activities. Conclusions In the web-spiders A. keyserlingi and N. plumipes good runners were also good climbers. This indicates that climbing and running largely represent a single locomotor performance characteristic in these spiders, but {{this was not the case}} for the jumping spider J. queenslandica. There was no evidence of a trade-off between maximum running and climbing speeds in these spiders. We highlight the need to establish the relationship between apparently disparate locomotor activities when testing alternative hypotheses that yield predictions about different locomotor activities. Analysis of slopes suggests greater potential for an evolutionary response on performance in the horizontal compared to vertical context in these spiders. </p...|$|R
30|$|As Greenspan (1997) states, affective {{signals are}} the primary {{concepts}} we use to experience the world, and they emerge prior to the sensorimotor patterns presented by Piaget (1962). Moreover, he showed that intellect, academic abilities, consciousness, and morality are rooted in our earliest emotional experiences (Greenspan and Shanker 2004). The crux of this approach to language development is that language skills evolve from a sequence of affective transformations, which make the child initially self-regulate and get interested in the world, and subsequently, following a series of further transformations, {{take part in the}} social interactions, become involved in shared attention, recognize social, communicative patterns, figure out other people’s intentions, imitate complex actions, form a sense of ‘self’, and create meaningful symbols (Greenspan and Lewis 2005).

We argue that grief functions as a hard-to-fake signal of <b>underlying</b> <b>capacities</b> to form strong social bonds. If so, those who grieve more intensively than others should be perceived as higher quality social partners. We tested this hypothesis in 4 studies. High grievers were rated as nicer, more loyal, and more trustworthy than low grievers. High grievers were also expected to cooperate in a prisoner’s dilemma more than low grievers. Last, high grievers were chosen as a trusted social partner more than another individual who expressed sadness for lost material items, indicating that grief may be a specific display of distress that is particularly informative to potential social partners. These results support a signaling theory of grief and are discussed in that context...|$|R

Here, we provide electrophysiological measures in humans of the initial selection and sustained attention processes that facilitate attentional tracking. Each measure was modulated by the number of objects the subject was tracking and was highly sensitive to each individual’s specific tracking capacity. Consequently, these measures provide strong neurophysiological predictors of an individual’s attentional tracking capacity.

These assignments are established through employee profiles which provide information on the competencies possessed by a certain employee, or job profiles which detail out the competency requirements of a certain job.

In multipath environments, {{such as those}} found in sensor networks, traditional internet routing solutions cannot be employed.

In this paper we propose the use of network coding over a multipath braided mesh topology that exploits both the low-cost mesh-topology construction, such as those obtained by diffusion algorithms, and the capacity-achieving capability of linear network coding. We implement our proposed algorithm using the ns- 2 network simulator, and demonstrate that it achieves the best energy efficiency of existing methods. Moreover, our solution easily adapts to changing conditions in the network and {{it can be used to}} adjust reliability on demand...|$|E

It is likely, however, that many adults who believe that they are unmusical are neurologically normal. We could call these adults “false ” amusics. Acquisition of musical competence has multiple personal, social, and environmental precursors.

In this work, we first derive an innovative formulation of the problem over acyclic overlay networks with arbitrary <b>underlay</b> <b>capacity</b> constraints. Then, based on the formulation, we develop a distributed algorithm to achieve the maximum broadcast rate and every user only maintains one queue per-neighbor. Due to its lightweight nature, our algorithm scales very well with the network size and remains robust against high system dynamics. Finally, by conducting simulations we validate the optimality of our algorithm under different network capacity models. Simulation results further indicate that the convergence time of our algorithm grows linearly with the network size, which suggests an interesting direction for future investigation...|$|R

An aggregate utility, which is assumed {{to depend on the}} users' rates, is used as performance metric. It is not assumed that the utility function is concave, allowing for more realistic utility models of applications with limited scalability. Due to the structure of the <b>underlying</b> <b>capacity</b> region, a two step approach is necessary. First, an optimal rate vector is determined. Second, the optimal parameter setup is derived from the optimal rate vector. Two methods for computing an optimal rate vector are proposed. First, based on the differential manifold structure offered by the boundary of the MIMO BC capacity region, a gradient projection method on the boundary is developed. Being a local algorithm, the method converges to a rate vector which is not guaranteed to be a globally optimal solution. Second, the monotonic structure of the rate space problem is exploited to compute a globally optimal rate vector with an outer approximation algorithm. While the second method yields the global optimum, the first method is shown to provide an attractive tradeoff between utility performance and computational complexity.|$|E
40|$|A {{centralized}} wireless {{system is}} considered that {{is serving a}} fixed set of users with time varying channel capacities. An opportunistic scheduling rule in this context selects a user (or users) to serve based on the current channel state and user queues. Unless the user traffic is symmetric and/or the <b>underlying</b> <b>capacity</b> region a polymatroid, little is known concerning how performance optimal schedulers should tradeoff "maximizing current service rate" (being opportunistic) versus "balancing unequal queues" (enhancing user-diversity to enable future high service rate opportunities). By contrast with currently proposed opportunistic schedulers, e. g., MaxWeight and Exp Rule, a radial sum-rate monotone (RSM) scheduler de-emphasizes queue-balancing in favor of greedily maximizing the system service rate as the queue-lengths are scaled up linearly. In this paper it is shown that an RSM opportunistic scheduler, p-Log Rule, is not only throughput-optimal, but also maximizes the asymptotic exponential decay rate of the sum-queue distribution for a two-queue system. The result complements existing optimality results for opportunistic scheduling and point to RSM schedulers as a good design choice given the need for robustness in wireless systems with both heterogeneity and high degree of uncertainty.
