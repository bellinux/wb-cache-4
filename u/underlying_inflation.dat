40|$|This paper {{explores the}} concept of <b>underlying</b> <b>inflation</b> and the {{properties}} of various measures of <b>underlying</b> <b>inflation</b> in the Australian context. <b>Underlying</b> <b>inflation</b> measures are routinely calculated and monitored by central banks in many countries, including the Reserve Bank of Australia. Alternative measurement concepts are explored, {{and a range of}} measures that have been calculated for Australia are discussed and evaluated on the basis of statistical criteria. These criteria capture the intuition that a good measure of <b>underlying</b> <b>inflation</b> should be less volatile than CPI (or headline) inflation, be unbiased with respect to CPI inflation, and capture the ‘trend’ in CPI inflation so that, on average, CPI inflation will tend to adjust towards the measure of <b>underlying</b> <b>inflation.</b> In the Australian context, statistical measures of <b>underlying</b> <b>inflation,</b> such as the trimmed mean or weighted median, perform fairly satisfactorily against these criteria. The performance of these measures can be further improved by seasonally adjusting prices at the CPI component level. Although <b>underlying</b> <b>inflation</b> measures have become less necessary in the past decade as inflation itself has become less volatile, these findings suggest that <b>underlying</b> <b>inflation</b> measures can still add value to the analysis of inflationary trends. underlying inflation; core inflation; trimmed mean; weighted median; volatility-weighted measures...|$|E

40|$|Many {{central banks}} often focus on <b>underlying</b> {{measures}} of <b>inflation</b> when assessing inflation trends. This paper compares {{the accuracy of}} <b>underlying</b> measures of <b>inflation</b> relative to the headline rates by using Australia data. It is found that the underlying measures did have smaller errors in predicting the long-term trend in inflation than the quarterly headline rate due to the volatility in the headline rate. As compared to the year-ended headline rate, the statistical test results, however, support only the measure of market prices excluding volatile items, not the others. There is some weak evidence of the weighted median measure outperforming the headline rate in the sub-period after 1993. With respect to directional accuracy, the test statistics cannot reject the null hypothesis of an equal probability correctly predicting the moving direction of the inflation trend, though the headline rates have a higher probability. ...|$|R

40|$|Inflation {{targeting}} {{central banks}} usually base their objectives on headline inflation, {{which is often}} affected by price movements of specific components whose behavior {{makes it difficult to}} extract clear signals about the inflationary outlook relevant for the monetary policy horizon. For this reason, several measures of <b>underlying</b> (core) <b>inflation</b> have been proposed with the purpose of removing this “noise”. This paper presents some alternatives calculated for the Chilean economy: three different measures that trim CPI components according to criteria of price changes and volatility, and two measures that re-weight the components according to historical volatility. In general terms, we find that the measures trimming away items with extreme price changes or high volatility are informative about the inflationary outlook given that they are unbiased with respect to the seasonally adjusted CPI and superior to other measures in tracking the headline inflation trend. ...|$|R

40|$|In these {{comments}} I {{will begin with}} a discussion of how central banks typically use measures of core or <b>underlying</b> <b>inflation</b> 1, and then discuss the specific methodology that Francesco Ravazzolo and Shaun Vahey propose. 2 How do central banks use measures of <b>underlying</b> <b>inflation?</b> There is significant ‘noise ’ in headline inflation. Good measures of <b>underlying</b> <b>inflation</b> are ones that help to abstract from this noise and give a better read of the ‘signal’. Understanding the current pace of inflation is important for central banks {{as a starting point for}} forecasts. In Brischetto and Richards (2006), we argue that good measures of <b>underlying</b> <b>inflation</b> are likely to have some short-term predictive power for inflation. I would stress that this is not about the predictability of inflation in two or three years: central banks use their economic models to forecast inflation at that horizon. Rather, tests of near-term predictability provide an indication of which measures of inflation have less noise and relatively more signal.

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the development}} in inflation in Denmark {{during the last}} century. New annual input-output based time-series data for the underlying domestic inflation in Denmark 1903 - 2002 is constructed by stripping the development in the private consumption deflator for price increases caused by the direct and indirect content of imports, indirect taxes and gross rents. The analysis {{seems to suggest that}} an input-output based <b>underlying</b> <b>inflation</b> measure paints a fundamentally different picture of the inflationary development than the private consumption deflator in periods with large structural movements in the relative prices or periods with high inflation volatility. The most marked example is the period 1973 - 1986 characterised by large increases in indirect taxes and gross rents as well as a high and volatile element of imported inflation due to large oil price movements as well as large and frequent devaluations of the Danish krone. A low level of input-output based <b>underlying</b> <b>inflation</b> does not necessary imply a low future level of inflation. The input-output based measure of underlying domestic inflation reflects the development in wages and gross profit per produced unit in domestic goods and services delivered for private consumption. A temporary drop in the level of <b>underlying</b> <b>inflation,</b> e. g. around the second oil-price shock, may therefore partly reflect a temporary squeeze of profit margins that later gets restored. An input-output based <b>underlying</b> <b>inflation</b> measure may however provide insights into the inflation process that can not be easily uncovered from other economic indicators. An inputoutput based measure of the <b>underlying</b> <b>inflation</b> can be a useful supplement to other types of information (e. g. the development in wages, output gap etc.) in relation to both an interpretation of the historical inflation development and as an input into a broad assessment of the current inflationary environment.

But these discussions take for granted our ability to measure the objects of interest, namely, aggregate price inflation and the level of output. Unfortu-nately, the measurement of aggregate inflation as a monetary phenomenon is difficult, as nonmonetary events, such as sector-specific shocks and measure-ment errors, can temporarily produce noise in the price data that substantially affects the aggregate price indices at higher frequencies.
