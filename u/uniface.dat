50|$|Some <b>unifaces</b> are {{characterized}} by systematic edge retouch, which was used to thin, straighten, sharpen, and smooth an artifact's edge, and were usually created with a specific purpose in mind. These formalized <b>unifaces</b> were often intended for woodworking, cutting, chopping, or hide-working purposes, and generally fall into easily classifiable types. While the following discussion does not cover some specialized types of <b>unifaces,</b> it does include the most common types.|$|R
40|$|Eldon <b>unifaces</b> are unifacially flaked stone tool {{artifacts}} that {{are unique to}} the Canadian Plains of the early-Middle Period (7, 500 - 4, 500 ya). They are unique because cortex covers the ventral side. The artifacts also have a suit of traits such as being thinned (or {{an attempt was made}} to thin), unifically flaked, and there is a preference for them to be made from large quartzite cobbles. Further morphological traits indicate that there are four related types of these tools: Classic, Corner, Side, and Amorphous; the first two are the focus of this thesis. Design theory and Châine Opératoire are used to study how the artifacts were made and used. Other geographic regions are sought for similar artifact forms: Manitoba, Eastern Woodlands /Maritimes, and British Columbia. It is the cobble spall tools from British Columbia that has the most striking similarity in morphology and manufacturing strategy. There are also important differences like in how Eldon <b>unifaces</b> are more heterogeneous and circumscribed to a shorter period of time than the British Columbia artifacts. A morphological and usewear analysis is undertaken to ascertain the function of Classic and Corner Eldon <b>unifaces.</b> The morphological analysis indicates that the tools were likely used to process medium to hard materials; however, the literature is rife with contraditctions on how to relate morphology with function. This questioned the reliability of a morphological approach to function and indicated that it needed to be supported by a usewear approach. The usewear analysis supported the inferences of the tools working medium to hard materials and also indicated how the tools were used (motion). Further, the usewear and morphological analyses also indicated that the Eldon <b>unifaces</b> were likely hafted...|$|R

25|$|They were {{typically}} {{made from a}} rounded stone, a block or lithic flake, using a hammer to remove flakes {{from both sides of}} the item. This hammer can be hard made of stone or of wood or antler. The latter two, softer hammers can produce more delicate results. However, a hand axe's technological aspect can reflect more differences. For example, <b>uniface</b> tools have only been worked on one side and partial bifaces retain a high proportion of the natural cortex of the tool stone, often making them easy to confuse with chopping tools. Further, simple bifaces may have been created from a suitable tool stone, but they rarely show evidence of retouching.|$|E
500|$|In September 1835, Thomas Sully {{received}} from Patterson {{a set of}} British coins and medals to help guide him while creating the Seated Liberty design. Sully sent Patterson three rough sketches {{near the beginning of}} October, and those were given to Gobrecht, who in turn set about making a copper engraving of the design. Gobrecht completed the engraving on October 14, and Patterson presented prints created from it to several government officials in an effort to gain their approval. President Jackson, Treasury Secretary Levi Woodbury, {{and the rest of the}} cabinet all approved of the design. On October 17, while Jackson and his cabinet were reviewing the design, Woodbury wrote Patterson giving permission to proceed with creating dies for the new coins based on the prints. In January 1836, die trials were conducted in soft metal. These pieces were then circulated among the public for suggestions. Patterson then authorized production of a steel obverse die; the reverse could not yet be created because Peale had yet to complete his design to Patterson's satisfaction. While Peale continued his work, Gobrecht began work on a design for a gold dollar, which occupied much of his time at the Mint. On April 9, Patterson wrote a letter to the Treasury secretary in which he included several of Peale's drawings; Patterson viewed one of the designs as the best created to date. Despite the director's approval of the design, he instructed Peale to continue until Patterson was satisfied. This was evidently achieved, because Patterson had Gobrecht to begin work on a reverse die in June. In August, Patterson sent a <b>uniface</b> striking of the reverse die to President Jackson, who approved designs for both sides of the coin ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{majority}} of the lithics found at Rudd Creek Pueblo were flaked stone and unretouched, while formal tools that had been carefully produced into an intentional tool, were rare. There were 698 flaked stone artifacts recovered, of which more than 80% were made of high quality silicates (including chert, chalcedony, petrified wood, and quartzite). [...] The {{majority of}} these flakes {{have been identified as}} simple flakes and are thought {{to be the result of}} percussion reduction, or the product of producing flakes by direct impact. As for formal tools, only a small number were recovered during excavation. Six <b>unifaces,</b> five bifaces, eleven saws/denticulates, and eleven projectile points were found and are similar to the tools documented at other Tularosa phase sites. [...] One room (Unit 6) yielded an unusual cache of stone tools in a closed floor pit. The cache consisted of a biface, three projectile points, and one red stone bead. The purpose of the cache is not known, but it has been interpreted that Rudd Creek Pueblo occupants might have gathered the tools from an adjacent area and kept them for ceremonial uses or out of curiosity. The large number of flaked stone in combination with few formal tools suggests that residents of the pueblo focused primarily on quick tool production and used stone flakes more often that formal tools.|$|R
40|$|In April 1996, the Center for Archaeological Research of The University of Texas at San Antonio was {{contracted}} by {{the city}} of New Braunfels to perform monitoring and testing to determine the impact of planned construction on cultural resources in Landa Park. The work was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 1682. The planned development called {{for the construction of a}} golf cart bam, and subsurface excavations for one electrical line and two waterlines to supply the bam with power and water. Shovel testing was performed on the proposed site of the golf cart bam and along transects for the utility lines. Monitoring was also conducted when the utility transects were trenched. The testing and monitoring operations uncovered various prehistoric and historic artifacts, including platform and nonplatform flakes, mussel shell, fire-cracked rock, glass, nails, and wire. The prehistoric material also included bifaces, <b>unifaces,</b> diagnostic projectile points (Scottsbluff, Hoxie, Montell, and Marcos), two Clear Fork tools, and one grooved grinding stone of ferruginous sandstone. In addition, a burned rock featurepossibly a large hearth-was discovered along one of the utility transects. Geological observations confirmed the contextual integrity of the artifacts. This new data expands the site boundaries of a previously recorded site, 41 CM 175, along the flanking edge of the T 1 terrace. The results of the testing and monitoring concluded that there is a long history of human occupation in the project area-starting from the Late Paleoindian period, through the Archaic, and into the Historic-and that cultural materials exist in good geological as well as archaeological contexts. The site, 41 CM 175, is recommended as eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places...|$|R

40|$|This report {{documents}} excavations at the Elsinore site (CA-RIV- 2798 /H) {{which is}} located {{at the mouth of the}} outlet channel on the northeast side of Lake Elsinore, Riverside County, California. Lake Elsinore is one of the only natural lakes in southern California, and {{is located at the}} eastern base of the Peninsular Range at the terminus of the San Jacinto River. Following the methodological approach of behavioral archaeology, this report explains how changes in lake level affected the lives of the people that lived on its shores. Identifying changes in site structure in relationship to the natural environment provides one of the keys to the interpretation of the lacustrine adaptations that took place over the past 8, 000 years. One of the most important aspects of the site is that it holds cultural remains representing the entire prehistory of the region in a stratified context. A total of 138. 45 m 3 of fill was excavated from 27 units in deposits nearly three meters deep. Excavations revealed a large flaked stone assemblage including bifaces, <b>unifaces,</b> projectile points, flake tools, and 19 crescents; a variety of ground stone artifacts are present as well. Distributional covariation of artifact and ecofact classes serves as the basis for intrasite comparisons and the overall interpretation of the site. The interpretation addresses issues such as site function, activity areas, and the effect of differing lake levels on the inhabitants. The presence of a stable lake during a time of climatic instability was probably the main factor that drew people to its shores. Initially these people were organized as small bands that moved throughout the area as resources became available in different environmental zones. However, during the early to middle Holocene transition we see a change in settlement structure associated with a social organizational shift to a family based society. Although investigations revealed a late Holocene occupation at the site, the structure of the site at this time is fundamentally different from the earlier periods and failed to produce data necessary to allow for comparable discussion of social change during the late Holocene...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the results of}} investigations undertaken to assess the archaeological resources at the Spring Lake Site, 41 HY 160, {{on the campus of}} Texas State University-San Marcos in Hays County, Texas. The Spring Lake Site, 41 HY 160, was recorded in the 1980 s at the Aquarena Center, then a privately owned water park. In 1994 Texas State University-San Marcos purchased the Aquarena Center with the intention of converting it into an educational and research facility focused on rivers and springs in Texas. Eventually the University founded the River Systems Institute and it is now housed at the Texas River Center in the restored Hotel at the San Marcos Springs. In preparation for the construction planning for the Texas River Center, an archaeological testing project was undertaken in January 2001 and this report {{describes the}} results of that investigation. The primary goal of this project was to determine if intact and well-preserved archaeological materials were contained in the area planned for eventually construction. An extensive geological coring effort extracted 22 cores from over 9 meters of alluvial sediments in the San Marcos River ﬂoodplain. These cores extended from the Hotel to beyond the football stadium. Five depositional units (A-E from older to younger) were identiﬁed, which dated from the Late Pleistocene to the Late Holocene, and all of these depositional units either contained preserved archaeological materials or were contemporary with know archaeological occupations in the immediate vicinity of Spring Lake. A single ﬂake was recovered from geological Core E in Depostional Unit A channel gravels. Radiocarbon dates conﬁrm sediment accumulation spanning the last ~ 12, 000 radiocarbon years. Archaeological test units recovered a wide range of lithic tools, faunal remains, burned rock features and ﬂ oral remains that have been identiﬁed as Middle and Late Archaic, and Late Prehistoric in age. Five intact burned rock features were excavated and documented. The careful excavation and archaeomagnetic analysis of burned rock from the cooking features demonstrates the presence of burned rock cooking pits and scattered burned rock hearths. These features were clearly constructed and used as cooking facilities by prehistoric inhabitants. The prehistoric inhabitants also actively hunted a number of large animals that consisted of bison, antelope and deer, and a variety of small species such as rabbits, turtle, ﬁ sh, rodents, and snakes. The more limited ﬂoral remains demonstrate the use of cheno-ams for food, and oak, juniper and bald cypress for ﬁrewood. Better preserved plant remains were recovered from Depositional Unit A in the geological Core D and these demonstrate the potential for well preserved archaeological ﬂoral remains is great in the deeper portions of the site. A great diversity of chipped stone artifacts (projectile points, preforms and other bifaces, scrapers and other <b>unifaces,</b> groundstone tools) provide the most abundant evidence of technological activities, and production and procurement strategies at the site. The wealth of evidence and the secure geological context of these materials, clearly demonstrates that the potential for the recovery of signiﬁcant archaeological materials at the Spring Lake Site, 41 HY 160, is great and it is recommended that any impacts of planned constructionon archaeological resources be mitigated. All recovered materials are curated at the Archaeological Curation Facility, Texas State University...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} concerns {{itself with}} the identification of prehistoric cultural remains as represented at the multicomponent Beaches site, DeAk- 1, Bonavista Bay. Several cultural traditions are known for this area and the Beaches site produced evidence of Maritime Archaic, Dorset and Beothuck groups. A chronological framework for these occupations is attempted {{on the basis of}} radiocarbon dating, stratigraphic position, and comparisons to other sites and cultural sequences. The interpretation of spatial arrangements of artifacts and habitation features is offered in an attempt to reconstruct their settlement patterns. Inferences on their subsistence activities is based on ethnographic data, the limited faunal remains, and reconstruction of the regional resource potential. [...] Occupational evidence at this coastal site occurred in two stratigraphically distinct layers. Cultural Layer 1 contained lithic artifacts attributed to Maritime Archaic, Dorset and Beothuck groups all in a single three inch occupation layer. Cultural Layer 2 was bottommost and clearly distinct with artifacts pertaining entirely to the Maritime Archaic tradition. [...] This lower Archaic component is characterized by chipped stone biface forms - bipointed, ovate, lanceolate and stemmed. Scrapers are present in the large retouched flakes but a formal flake end scraper category has not been identified. The ground stone industry - celts, a single ground slate point and abrader, is not present in large amounts. A blade-core industry is unique and definitely part of this Archaic component. Three radiocarbon dates, 1740 B. C., 1890 B. C., and 2950 B. C. indicate the early temporal position of their occupation. [...] The upper Archaic component reflects cultural continuity through these Archaic groups with identical chipped stone forms occurring. Temporal and stylistic variations are seen in the greater variety of stemmed points, flake <b>unifaces,</b> and the presence of flake end scrapers. The ground stone industry is well established although ground slate points were not found. The blade-core industry is also present in this later Archaic component although examples tend to be cruder. A guess-date of 1500 B. C. may validly indicate the initial Archaic occupation in this stratum. It may have terminated just prior to Dorset intrusion into Newfoundland and Bonavista Bay. [...] The Dorset occupation was probably initiated during the early centuries B. C. This early population movement is postulated {{on the basis of a}} few artifacts considered time-sensitive. The main Dorset occupation however occurred during the first half of the first millennium A. D. A date of A. D. 300 from a Dorset hearth supports this interpretation. [...] An influx of Indian groups is seen towards the termination of the Dorset period. These groups represent the initial Beothuck population in Newfoundland. The Beaches site provided only six corner-notched points which we can ascribe with certainty to these people. As a further reflection of our inadequate knowledge of Beothuck prehistory, these cannot be assigned to any temporal position in the Beothuck development. [...] The reconstruction of subsistence-settlement patterns reveals a basic coastal-interior adaptation for all cultural groups. A spring to fall coastal occupation for specialized sea mammal exploitation is postulated. Interior subsistence is based on the large congregating winter herds and a deep interior penetration and interior settlement was necessary. This was probably facilitated by the large river systems in the Bonavista Bay area. This regional distribution of abundant coastal resources among the many islands and reaches plus interior caribou herds provided the establishment of similar settlement patterns for the various cultural occupations in Bonavista Bay...|$|R
