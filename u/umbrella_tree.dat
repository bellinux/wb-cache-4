5|$|The Swan Coastal Plain {{north of}} Perth {{has become an}} {{important}} feeding area. There, cockatoos also forage in the Gnangara pine plantations, where they feed on the seeds of Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) and maritime pine (Pinus pinaster). Carnaby's black cockatoos have come to depend on these plantations since the early 20th century. Almost two-thirds of the Carnaby's black cockatoos in the Perth–Peel Coastal Plain roost in the Gnangara-Pinjar pine plantation. Other non-native plants that the birds also consume include Erodium species, doublegee (Emex australis) seeds, {{the fruit of the}} <b>umbrella</b> <b>tree</b> (Schefflera actinophylla), seeds of liquidambar (Liquidambar styraciflua), sunflower (Helianthus annuus), jacaranda (Jacaranda mimosifolia), almond (Prunus amygdalus), onion grass (Romulea rosea), white cedar (Melia azedarach), and hibiscus flowers.|$|E
2500|$|The Palm house, {{maintained}} at 70°F, is housed under the dome, and contains {{a variety of}} tropical trees and palms, including the Chinese fan palm (Livistona chinensis), the fishtail palm (Caryota mitis), the <b>umbrella</b> <b>tree</b> (Schefflera actinophylla) and the Canary Island date palm (Phoenix canariensis). When a tree reaches {{the top of the}} dome it must be cut down, as they cannot be pruned to height. The Tropical house, 70°F, contains fruiting plants and trees such as the common fig, calamondin orange and bloodleaf banana, and tropical flowering plants such as the pink powderpuff (Calliandra brevipes) and peace lily (Spathiphyllum). The Cactus house, 62°F, is lined in tufa rock and holds a variety of cacti and succulents, including jellybeans (Sedum pachyphyllum), the silver dollar cactus (Opuntia robusta), [...] "old man" [...] cactus (Cephalocereus senilis) and jade plant (Crassula ovata). The Fernery is sunken to provide cooler conditions and more humidity. Ferns such as the alsophila can be found here, as well as a small waterfall located in the center. The Show house changes its display many times throughout the year and is also used for the conservatory's many flower shows and special events. The perennial gardens are located outside {{to the north of the}} vestibule.|$|E

40|$|The {{spatial pattern}} of {{outbreaks}} of pink wax scale, Ceroplastes rubens Maskell, within and among <b>umbrella</b> <b>trees,</b> Schefflera actinophylla (Endl.), in southeastern Queensland was investigated. Pink wax scale was common on S. actinophylla, with approximately 84 % of trees positive for scale and 14 % of bees recording outbreak densities exceeding 0. 4 adults per leaflet. Highly aggregated distributions of C. rubens occur within and among <b>umbrella</b> <b>trees.</b> Clumped distributions within trees appear {{to result from}} variable birth and death rates and limited movement of first instar crawlers. The patchy distribution of pink wax scale among trees is probably a consequence of variation in dispersal success of scale, host and environmental suitability for establishment and rates of biological control. Pink wax scale was more prevalent on trees in roadside positions and in exposed situations, indicating that such trees are more suitable and/or susceptible to scale colonisation...|$|R

40|$|The {{degree and}} {{distribution}} of parasitisation in relation to densities of pink wax scale, Ceroplastes rubens Maskell, on <b>umbrella</b> <b>trees,</b> Schefflera actinophylla (Endl.), in south-eastern Queensland were investigated to determine whether scale outbreaks could be attributed, in part, to low levels of parasitisation. Rates of parasitisation were independent of or inversely dependent on host density, and highly variable, especially at low densities. The absence of density dependent parasitisation may occur as a result of: (i) non-aggregation by parasitoids; (ii) aggregation by parasitoids where parasitisation is limited by intrinsic or extrinsic factors; and/or (iii) high rates of hyperparasitisation...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} some of {{the factors}} that may lead to outbreaks of pink wax scale, Ceroplastes rubens Maskell, on <b>umbrella</b> <b>trees,</b> Schefflera actinophylla (Endl.). Estimates of birth and death rates of pink wax scale were high and variable within and among trees; variation in these rates was not related to scale density. Adult fecundity correlated significantly but weakly with adult test length; mean fecundity was 292 eggs per female with a range of 5 - 1178. Adult test length and its variance decreased weakly with increasing density. Field experiments showed that mortality of C. rubens is greatest during the first 24 hours after hatching when approximately half disappear. The rate of loss decreases over time with 0. 3 % of initial motile first-instar nymphs surviving to maturity. Rates of loss varied significantly between trees, indicating that some trees are more suitable for scale colonisation and survival...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} impact of random noise (queueing delay) on the {{performance}} of a multicast session. With a simple analytical model, we analyze the throughput degradation within a multicast (one-to-many) tree under TCP-like congestion and flow control. We use the (max,plus) formalism together with methods based on stochastic comparison (association and convex ordering) and on the theory of extremes (Lai and Robbins' notion of maximal characteristics) to prove various properties of the throughput. We first prove that the throughput obtained from Golestani's deterministic model [1] is systematically optimistic. In presence of light tailed random noise, we show that the throughput decreases like the inverse of the logarithm of the number of receivers. We find analytically an upper and a lower bound for the throughput degradation. Within these bounds, we characterize the degradation which is obtained for various tree topologies. In particular, we observe that a class of trees commonly found in IP multicast sessions [9] (which we call <b>umbrella</b> <b>trees)</b> is significantly more sensitive to network noise than other topologies.

Some species abundant along the public walking tracks, often noticed and photographed by tourists, are as follows. The bright orange seasonally fruiting, small shrubs of chain fruits Alyxia ruscifolia and hairy red pittosporum Pittosporum rubiginosum occur commonly along the tracks. Many vine species grow up to the canopy, including the well known and conspicuous wait-a-while or rattan palm-vines Calamus australis and more related spp.. Many epiphytes grow on the trees’ branches and trunks, including the often noticed ferns, the birds-nest ferns Asplenium australasicum, basket ferns Drynaria rigidula and elkhorn ferns Platycerium hillii; large epiphyte and hemiepiphyte trees and shrubs, including commonly the many strangler figs Ficus spp., <b>umbrella</b> <b>trees</b> Schefflera actinophylla and the cape jitta Fagraea berteroana. Locally abundant and conspicuous large trees include the Daintree penda Lindsayomyrtus racemoides with wet season purple new foliage growth, abundant cauliflorous trees that have flowers and fruits on the trunk, for example, the cluster figs species Ficus spp. and the yellow mahogany trees Dysoxylum parasiticum. Further locally abundant species of trees include the Australian native nutmeg trees Myristica globosa, the several lady apples or lilly pillies species Syzygium spp. and lining the Mossman River and the creeks’ banks the golden penda trees Xanthostemon chrysanthus.|$|R
