5|$|El 18 is a {{modification}} of the Swiss Re 460. The class was originally built in 119 units from 1992 to 1995 for the Swiss State Railways, where it was given the brand Lok 2000. It {{was part of a}} project to create a series of new intercity locomotives and cars. Bern–Lötschberg–Simplon-Bahn received eight units in 1994 (as Re 465), the Finnish State Railways received 46 units between the years 1995-2003 (as Sr2) and the Kowloon–Canton Railway Corporation received 2 units in 1997. The units are designed to haul heavy passenger trains along existing curved railways at high speeds. It is designed as a <b>universal</b> <b>locomotive,</b> so it is also suitable for freight trains.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, West German federal railway Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB) sought to replace its ageing {{electric}} locomotive fleet {{with a single}} type. In the previous decade, DB introduced its first universal locomotives with three-phase asynchronous induction motors and two bogies with two powered axles each, the DB Class 120, which had been successful. In 1991, DB requested bids for about 1000 more universal locomotives with an improved design and increased power, the planned DB Class 121. The railway industry began developing new locomotives, but in October 1992, DB cancelled the tender due to {{the high price of}} the offers and the changed situation. In 1994, Deutsche Bundesbahn merged with the former East German Deutsche Reichsbahn, creating Deutsche Bahn, bringing over 600 modern DR Class 243 locomotives into the joint locomotive fleet. In addition, the merger coincided with a railway reform, dividing the rolling stock of Deutsche Bahn between its regional passenger, long-distance passenger and freight business areas, making the <b>universal</b> <b>locomotive</b> plans obsolete. From late 1993, the business areas of Deutsche Bahn and their predecessors called new bids for electric locomotives tailored for their specific needs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{competitors}} for the DB Class 121 {{included two}} of the forerunners of Bombardier Transportation: German locomotive manufacturer AEG Schienenfahrzeuge, a part of AEG which was controlled by Daimler-Benz at the time; and ABB Henschel, a German locomotive manufacturing branch of Swedish-Swiss company ABB. Components of both the AEG and ABB concepts were built into the prototypes of the DB Class 120 for trials from late 1991. AEG followed up its development effort by building an experimental <b>universal</b> <b>locomotive,</b> the 12X. This locomotive can be considered the predecessor of the TRAXX family. The 12X was delivered in June 1994 and, although owned by AEG, was designated Class 128 by DB. The 12X featured several innovations compared to the Class 120, including water-cooled inverters based on GTO thyristors, a new final drive concept with pivot axle bearings on both sides, and a new bogie concept with a short wheelbase of [...] The locomotive also had a modular design, allowing the derivation of different versions for different operational needs, and thus it formed AEG's basis {{to compete for the}} new orders of Deutsche Bahn's business areas. [...] Meanwhile, ABB developed its own design of a modular electric locomotive platform, the Eco2000 concept. ABB's concept included a version of its Flexifloat high-speed bogie family with a wheelbase of and biodegradable ester cooled inverters with GTO thyristors and an also ester cooled main transformer, which can be considered the origin of the inverters and transformer of the first generation of TRAXX locomotives.|$|E
50|$|Locomotives {{similar in}} design to the DFH2 type but built to meter gauge {{and used as}} <b>universal</b> <b>{{locomotives}}.</b> The locomotives were used on the Kunming metre gauge railway, including passenger services.|$|R
5000|$|While the GE 750 {{demonstrator}} {{was still}} testing GE built two XP24 demonstrators, numbers 751 and 752 in 1959. These units {{became the first}} U25Bs. The GE U25B became the first widely sold domestic market GE <b>Universal</b> Series <b>locomotive.</b> North American <b>Universal</b> Series <b>locomotives</b> are often called [...] "U-Boats" [...] by railfans and model railroaders.|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of the locomotive was initiated {{in anticipation of a}} major tender for <b>universal</b> <b>locomotives</b> by German railways, but moved towards a modular design when the railways moved towards tendering different types of locomotives for different services. The 12X was the basis of a locomotive class for medium-weight freight trains, the DBAG Class 145, the further {{development of}} which ultimately led to Bombardier's TRAXX modular locomotive product platform.|$|R

50|$|The {{design was}} {{intended}} to be the first truly <b>universal</b> <b>locomotive,</b> capable of pulling fast passenger trains as well as heavy freight trains. While the electric equipment exceeded expectations, the mechanical part suffered from its lightweight construction necessitated by the heavy electronics of the time.|$|E
50|$|The SJ Class Rc is {{the most}} used {{electric}} locomotive in Sweden. Rc is a <b>universal</b> <b>locomotive</b> used both in freight and passenger trains. The largest operator is Green Cargo, although SJ, Veolia Transport, Tågåkeriet, Hector Rail and the Swedish Transport Administration operate it as well.|$|E
50|$|From the <b>universal</b> <b>locomotive,</b> kkStB Class 73 with an {{operating}} weight of 55.1 tons, 436 pieces were ordered. Thanks to its capacity of 700 PS they could transport {{in the plane}} 1,650 tons with 30 km/h, on a slope of 10 ‰ a weight of 580t with 15 km/h and on a slope of 25 ‰ 220t, also with 15 km/h. They were mainly used for freight traffic.|$|E

5000|$|Due to the {{termination}} of locomotive production at the factory in Martin, the Czechoslovak Ministry of Transport requested the expedited delivery of four-axle locomotives with a power output of [...] for shunting and light freight service. ČKD modified the T 448.0 design {{to meet the needs}} of the ČSD. This resulted in a lightweight <b>universal</b> <b>locomotive,</b> Class T 466.2, which conceptually and dimensionally was identical to the T 448.0.|$|E
5000|$|The {{electrification}} of the Dovre Line in {{the late}} 1960s forced NSB to buy a more powerful <b>universal</b> <b>locomotive</b> than the El 13. Based on the Swiss Ae 6/6 and NSB El 13, both developed in the 1950s, the El 14 introduced three-axle boogies in Norway while the power was increased to [...] and the weight reduced to 105 t; remaining more powerful than its successors El 16 and El 17.|$|E
5000|$|Locomotive {{manufacturers}} {{responded to}} the changed situation {{by focusing on the}} modularity of their designs, allowing the derivation of different types of locomotives by removing or rearranging the components of a <b>universal</b> <b>locomotive.</b> After the cancellation of the DB Class 121 order, AEG continued its development effort under the informal project name [...] "12x", and decided to produce a prototype on its own. The decision was also motivated by further elements of the 1994 railway reform, which led to rail operators issuing tenders for complete vehicles rather than let manufacturers compete at the level of components, and the creation of an independent authority for vehicle approval. [...] AEG spent 40 million Deutsche Mark (DM) on the 12x development programme, the construction of the locomotive itself cost another 8 million DM. [...] AEG painted the experimental <b>universal</b> <b>locomotive</b> in the red and white company colours, named it 12X (with capital X), and held its rollout ceremony on 30 June 1994. [...] Although owned by AEG, the 12X was designated 128 001 by DB.|$|E
50|$|The ÖBB Class 1043 is a {{class of}} thyristor-controlled <b>universal</b> {{electric}} <b>locomotives</b> operated initially by the Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB). The ten {{members of the class}} were derived from the Class Rc operated by the Swedish State Railways (SJ).|$|R

50|$|The DR Class 243 is a <b>universal</b> {{electric}} <b>locomotive</b> of the Deutsche Reichsbahn {{which is}} used for general rail service. Deutsche Bahn lists the locomotive as Class 143. The locomotives of class 143/243 still belong to the most successful class of German electric locomotives.|$|R
50|$|The Class 112 {{locomotives}} {{became an}} unexpected symbol of German reunification {{because they were}} the first locomotive class to be used by both the Deutsche Reichsbahn and the Deutsche Bundesbahn. DR and DB each ordered 45 slightly improved locomotives of Class 112.1 from AEG, who had taken over LEW Hennigsdorf as they had owned the factory in 1946. The decision for DB to order Class 112.1 locomotives was mainly to support the factory at Hennigsdorf as DB would have preferred a 200 km/h <b>universal</b> <b>locomotive</b> such as the Class 120.|$|E
50|$|The P 6 was {{conceived}} as a so-called <b>universal</b> <b>locomotive.</b> The first vehicle was manufactured in 1902 at Düsseldorf by the firm of Hohenzollern. This engine {{has a number of}} features that are characteristic of its designer, Robert Garbe: a narrow chimney located well forward and the unusual position of the boiler. As a result, and in spite of the relatively small, 1,600 mm diameter, driving wheels (on the prototype they were only 1,500 mm), the locomotives were authorised to travel at up to 90 km/h, a speed which could not be attained in practice due to its poor riding qualities.|$|E
50|$|This {{locomotive}} {{came into}} existence during the 1950s when the Dk, Ds and Dg locos were upgraded to motors of the same type as in Da. Many of the engines also lost their gangway connections. In this rebuilding the difference between passenger and freight locos disappeared, since they now were capable of 100 km/h. The Du became a <b>universal</b> <b>locomotive,</b> though {{in the end it}} was mainly used for freight trains. It disappeared from service in 1977, with the dismantle of the wooden locos, while the steel units were rebuilt to Du2. 244 of the D units have had the Du designation.|$|E
50|$|Pesa Gama is {{a family}} of diesel and {{electric}} locomotives built from 2012 by Pesa SA company. Initially, only two units have been built - {{the first was a}} <b>universal</b> electric <b>locomotive</b> with an additional diesel engine, the second was built with only a diesel powered engine. There are currently 16 locomotives in service, in 3 different versions.|$|R
50|$|The 5400-series Red Flag-class (붉은기, Pulg'ŭn'gi) is a {{class of}} <b>universal</b> {{mainline}} electric <b>locomotives</b> built by the Kim Chong-t'ae Electric Locomotive Works for the Korean State Railway.|$|R
50|$|The 424 was a <b>universal</b> {{main line}} <b>locomotive.</b> It {{was used to}} haul heavy freight trains, {{stopping}} trains and express trains. The 424 locomotives are well known abroad as well.|$|R
50|$|This {{series is}} {{originally}} {{based on the}} license of the Swedish company ASEA. It was produced {{in order to be}} used as a <b>universal</b> <b>locomotive,</b> for both passenger and freight traffic. There was a need to have a powerful electric locomotive to pull freight. At that time, this was mainly on the mainline tracks, which were electrified, and prepared for 160 km/h. Originally, it had diode voltage selector. A later, modernised series, the 3xx subseries, include thyristor voltage selector, and an on-board computer. Later 3xx series have an onboard look-behind-camera for video surveillance of the sides and also new livery.|$|E
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1990s SNCB had a requirement to renew its mainline locomotive fleet: it required fast high power passenger locomotives for intercity trains on lines between Ostend, Brussels, Liege and Eupen, as well as needing replacements for SNCB diesel locomotive classes 52, 53 and 54 which dated to the 1950s and were used on freight trains for the steel industry on the Maas-Athus line and into Luxembourg. These requirements led to the decision to acquire a <b>universal</b> <b>locomotive</b> design. The design specifications included a minimum top speed of 200 km/h and capability to operate under 3kV DC and 25kV AC electrification.|$|E
50|$|DB Class 120 was {{the first}} {{locomotive}} class of West German federal railway Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB) with three-phase asynchronous AC induction motors, and also the first implementation {{of the concept of}} the <b>universal</b> <b>locomotive,</b> which is suited for freight, passenger and express service alike. DB received the five prototypes from 1979, and all Germany-based locomotive manufacturers were involved in the delivery of the 60 series locomotives from 1987. In 1991, DB requested bids for an initial 500 universal locomotives with an improved design and a continuous power increased from , the planned DB Class 121. Former East German state railways Deutsche Reichsbahn also considered purchasing 200 units.|$|E
50|$|By 1956 General Electric had {{launched}} their first <b>Universal</b> Series road <b>locomotives</b> primarily as export units. The U25B followed in 1961 and rapidly propelled GE into {{second place in}} the locomotive market, behind EMD.|$|R
50|$|The GE <b>Universal</b> Series <b>{{locomotives}}</b> were {{diesel locomotives}} originally launched by GE in early 1956. The latest variant in the Universal Series {{was built in}} 2005. Initially, there were nine U-series models: U4B, U6B, U9B, U9C, U12B, U12C, U18B, U18C and UD18B. They were designed to be readily adaptable to different track gauges for export markets and very reliable. The U5B and U8B appeared later, being first built for RFFSA, Brazil in 1961.|$|R
