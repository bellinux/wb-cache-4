2500|$|The closest {{railway station}} {{to the campus}} is Canterbury West which is, as of 2009, served by Southeastern High Speed trains, {{connecting}} Canterbury with London St Pancras International [...] in 56 minutes. These services stop at Ashford International en route, thus providing a direct connection to Eurostar services to France and Belgium. Standard Southeastern services also connect Canterbury West and Canterbury East Stations with London Victoria and Charing Cross. Both of the Canterbury stations can be accessed by the <b>UniBus</b> service. The nearest international air services are provided from the London airports, Gatwick and Heathrow, with direct National Express coach services to both from Canterbury bus station. The campus is also served by two coach services (Route 007) to/from London each day, with further services operating from Canterbury bus station ...|$|E

50|$|Later Q-Bus based {{systems such}} as the LSI-11/23, /73, and /83 are based upon chip sets {{designed}} in house by Digital Equipment Corporation. Later PDP-11 <b>Unibus</b> systems were designed to use similar Q-Bus processor cards, using a <b>Unibus</b> adapter to support existing <b>Unibus</b> peripherals, sometimes with a special memory bus for improved speed.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Unibus</b> {{made the}} PDP-11 {{suitable}} for custom peripherals. One of the predecessors of Alcatel-Lucent, the Bell Telephone Manufacturing Company, developed the BTMC DPS-1500 packet-switching (X.25) network and used PDP-11s {{in the regional}} and national network management system, with the <b>Unibus</b> directly connected to the DPS-1500 hardware.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Unibus</b> was the {{earliest}} of several computer bus and backplane designs used with PDP-11 and early VAX systems manufactured by the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) of Maynard, Massachusetts. The <b>Unibus</b> was developed around 1969 by Gordon Bell and student Harold McFarland while at Carnegie Mellon University.|$|E

50|$|The VAX-11/780 {{uses the}} <b>Unibus</b> and Massbus for I/O. <b>Unibus</b> {{is used for}} {{attaching}} peripherals and Massbus for disk and tape drives. Both buses are provided by adapters that interface the bus to the SBI. All systems come with one <b>Unibus</b> as standard, with up to four supported. Massbus is optional, with up to four supported. The VAX-11/780 also supports Computer Interconnect (CI), a proprietary network to attach disk drives and potentially share them with other VAX computers. Later, this feature was used to connect VAX computers in a VMScluster.|$|E
50|$|The LSI-11 (PDP-11/03), {{introduced}} in February 1975 {{is the first}} PDP-11 model produced using large-scale integration; the entire CPU is contained on four LSI chips made by Western Digital (the MCP-1600 chip set; a fifth chip {{can be added to}} extend the instruction set, as pictured on the right). It uses a bus which is a close variant of the <b>Unibus</b> called the LSI Bus or Q-Bus; it differs from the <b>Unibus</b> primarily in that addresses and data are multiplexed onto a shared set of wires rather than having separate sets of wires. It also differs slightly in how it addresses I/O devices and it eventually allowed a 22-bit physical address (whereas the <b>Unibus</b> only allows an 18-bit physical address) and block-mode operations for significantly improved bandwidth (which the <b>Unibus</b> does not support).|$|E

50|$|In August 1970 several River Heights {{residents}} opposed a jointly managed <b>Unibus</b> {{shuttle service}} for University of Manitoba students. Riding <b>Unibus</b> would save students from paying the regular adult fare, instead {{they would pay}} $20 for six months' use. However, residents were upset that the routes would depreciate housing where the buses traversed and that the service was only available to University students.|$|E

Up to 20 nodes (devices) can be connected to a single <b>Unibus</b> segment; additional segments can be connected via a bus repeater.|$|E

Adapters were available from Digital and from third parties that allow Q-bus devices to be connected to Unibus-based computers and vice versa. A number of I/O devices were available in either <b>Unibus</b> or Q-bus flavors; some of these devices have minor differences while many others were essentially identical.|$|E

50|$|By {{encoding}} {{control signals}} serially {{they could be}} AC-coupled (with a transformer)to prevent ground loop problems and EMI issues between the controller and the drives, which could be connected by long cables, even to different floors in a building. The same serial interconnect was used for tape and solid state storage devices to the storage subsystem controllers. Large VAX systems primarily used the Hierarchical Storage Controller (HSC) series but <b>Unibus</b> and BI Bus controllers to SDI were built as well. The UDA50 for the <b>Unibus</b> was the first controller shipped with the SDI interface.|$|E
50|$|Higher-performance {{members of}} the PDP-11 family, {{starting}} with the PDP-11/45 <b>Unibus</b> and 11/83 Q-bus systems, departed from the single-bus approach. Instead, memory was interfaced by dedicated circuitry and space in the CPU cabinet, while the <b>Unibus</b> continued {{to be used for}} I/O only. In the PDP-11/70, this was taken a step further, {{with the addition of a}} dedicated interface between disks and tapes and memory, via the Massbus. Although input/output devices continued to be mapped into memory addresses, some additional programming was necessary to set up the added bus interfaces.|$|E
50|$|The FTR {{scheme was}} largely unpopular {{with people in}} York {{for a number of}} reasons, such as {{problems}} with ticketing, pricing, being late and the vehicles being excessively long. Protests were especially heated among students and the York University Student Union was engaged in negotiations with First York to introduce student discounts. The university later discussed contracts with York Pullman. York Pullman began the <b>UniBus</b> service between the university and the station. Due to competition from the <b>UniBus</b> (now owned by Transdev York) the price of the ticket for students on route 4 dropped significantly.|$|E
50|$|Early {{models of}} the PDP-11 had no {{dedicated}} bus for input/output, but only a system bus called the <b>Unibus,</b> as input and output devices were mapped to memory addresses.|$|E
50|$|The Digital Equipment Corporation {{minicomputer}} <b>Unibus</b> systems used terminator {{cards with}} 178 Ω pullup resistors on the multi-drop address and data lines, and 383 Ω on the single-drop signal lines.|$|E
50|$|The Q-bus {{is a less}} {{expensive}} version of <b>Unibus</b> using multiplexing so that address and data signals share the same wires. This allows both a physically smaller and less-expensive implementation of essentially the same functionality.|$|E
50|$|The 16-bit (<b>Unibus)</b> {{controller}} {{was known}} as the RK11; it allowed the connection of up to eight RK05 drives. Seeks could be overlapped among the drives but only one drive at a time could transfer data.|$|E
5000|$|The {{number of}} scooter {{manufacturers}} and designs increased after World War I. The Skootamota, the Kenilworth, and the Reynolds Runabout debuted in 1919, with Gloucestershire Aircraft Company following with its <b>Unibus</b> in 1920. [...] The Skootamota was noted for being practical, popular, and economical, the Kenilworth for its electric lights, and the Reynolds Runabout for its advanced specifications, including front suspension, a two-speed gearbox, leg shields, and a seat sprung with leaf springs and coil springs. [...] The <b>Unibus</b> {{also had a}} two-speed gearbox, {{but it is more}} notable for its full bodywork, similar to that which would appear of second- and third-generation scooters.|$|E
50|$|Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) further {{reduced cost}} for mass-produced minicomputers, and mapped {{peripherals}} into the memory bus, {{so that the}} input and output devices appeared to be memory locations. This was implemented in the <b>Unibus</b> of the PDP-11 around 1969.|$|E
50|$|The {{reputation}} of first-generation scooters was damaged by {{a glut of}} unstable machines with flexible frames, and more substantial examples like the Reynolds Runabout and the <b>Unibus</b> were too expensive to be competitive. The first generation had ended by the mid-1920s.|$|E
