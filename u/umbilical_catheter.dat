40|$|Neonatal sepsis is an {{important}} cause of death and morbidity in newborns and is diagnosed by isolation of organism in blood culture. In several reports,reliablity of blood cultures were done from umbi lical catheters,have been demonstrated. The objective {{of the present study}} was to determine,wether an inde welling <b>umbilical</b> <b>catheter,</b> could be an alternative site for blood culture. In a prospective study over 6 months during 2006, 141 paired blood cultures from 134 infant,were done simultaneously from peripheral site and <b>umbilical</b> <b>catheter</b> (mostly U. V. C),during the first four days of life. Majority of these infants were preterm and admitted to NICU for special care. these infants had indwelling umbilical line and had indication of sepsis workup. A total of 141 pairs of blood cultures were obtained from 134 infants. In 16 infants blood culture pairs were positive for one organism in both peripheral vein and umbilical site. 71. 6 % of total cultures (n= 11) pairs were negative in boths site. A total of 22 pairs were positive in one site only,with 5 positive from peripheral vein only and the other 17 from umblical site. Two pairs were positve in boths site with two different organism. In over all 16 infant (11 %) of blood were considered to be contaminated. Contamination rate were 2. 4 % and 9. 2 % for peripheral and <b>umbilical</b> <b>catheter</b> site. Contamination rate increased after 48 hours of age in <b>umbilical</b> <b>catheter.</b> The result showed that after 2 days contamination rate for blood culture taken from catheter line increased and specifity decreased. We recommended that blood culture via umblical catheter in first 2 days in sick neonates with indwelling catheter can be a alternate site of blood culture sampelling. </p...|$|E
40|$|Introduction The {{use of an}} {{umbilical}} catheterization is a usual {{practice in}} neonatal units. The insertion of the catheter has potential complications. Case Presentation Here, we report on our observation of a seven-day-old female newborn admitted for an abdominal distention and vomiting bile. Initially, diagnosis was midgut volvulus, for which an operation was performed. During the surgery, no intestinal malrotation, mesenteric defect or atresia was observed. Postoperative diagnosis was abdominal wall hematoma and rand ligament and ileus, as well as, sub-capsular liver hematoma. The patient had been hospitalized at birth at a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). With the appearance of icterus {{on the first day}} of life, at the NICU tried to insert the <b>umbilical</b> <b>catheter</b> that had been filed. Conclusions The complication found in the patient was the result of an aggressive act (the <b>umbilical</b> <b>catheter</b> insertion). This intervention should not be carried out unless there are clear indications, and if so, it should be done with much care...|$|E

40|$|Objective: An <b>umbilical</b> {{arterial}} <b>catheter</b> {{is often}} used to monitor blood pressure and take frequent blood samples in the very low birth weight newborn infant requiring neonatal intensive care. Incorrect placement of the <b>umbilical</b> arterial <b>catheter</b> increases catheter complications, and adjustment of catheter position after radiograph increases infant handling and infection risk. Current methods overestimate insertion length in very low birth weight babies. We suggest a new formula for calculating insertion length that is more appropriate for today's neonatal intensive care population. The <b>Umbilical</b> Arterial <b>Catheter</b> Calculation Study, Australian Perinatal Trials Register PT 0398, was set up to investigate this technical change. Our hypothesis was that the new formula would improve the siting of <b>umbilical</b> arterial <b>catheters</b> in very low birth weight infants. Design: Randomized control trial. Setting: Tertiary referral neonatal intensive care unit. Patients: All infants < 1500 g who were free from major cardiovascular malformations and who received an <b>umbilical</b> arterial <b>catheter</b> for clinical reasons were eligible for the study. Interventions: Infants were randomized to current practice, using a nomogram derived from Dunn (control), or to the new formula: insertional length (cm) = (4 x birth weight [kg]) + 7. Primary outcome was correct catheter position (T 6 - 10) on initial radiograph. Measurements and Main Results: Seventy-four randomized infants had catheters successfully inserted. There {{were no significant differences between}} the groups in birth weight, gestational age, or gender. There was a significant increase in correctly sited catheters (p =. 003) with the new formula. Overinsertion of the <b>umbilical</b> arterial <b>catheter</b> was significantly less likely (p <. 0001). Underinsertion was not significantly increased. <b>Umbilical</b> arterial <b>catheter</b> manipulation after radiograph was decreased from 50 % to 5 % (p =. 007).

40|$|Total {{parenteral}} alimentation (TPA) {{was delivered}} to 80 infants via indwelling umbilical artery and to 9 via indwelling <b>umbilical</b> venous <b>catheters.</b> The primary indication for catheter placement and maintenance was monitoring of arterial blood gases (<b>umbilical</b> venous <b>catheter</b> tip in left atrium) {{in a group of}} sick neonates requiring increased inspired oxygen or assisted ventilation. Results were compared with those from 23 infants who had tunnelled jugular catheters for a variety of chronic medical and surgical problems preventing gastric or intestinal feeding. A mean weight gain was achieved in both groups. Mortality and morbidity rates were similar in both groups. The most common complications were infection and thrombotic phenomena. Metabolic complications were few. It is concluded that infusing TPA solutions via indwelling <b>umbilical</b> <b>catheters</b> presents no greater risk than infusion via tunnelled jugular catheters, and provides a method for supplying adequate caloric intake for growth during the acute stage of illness...|$|R
40|$|Two neonates, a girl born at 40 2 / 7 weeks {{weighing}} 4165 g {{and a boy}} born at 37 6 / 7 weeks weighing 4040 g, received umbilical venous catheters to help manage hypoglycaemia. The catheter was ineffective or {{only effective}} when high doses of glucose were used, due to what later appeared to be arterial positioning of the catheter. Both patients recovered without consequences. Persistent hypoglycaemia is a common problem in newborns and can cause severe neurological sequelae. A relatively uncommon cause is malpositioning of the <b>umbilical</b> <b>catheter.</b> Positioning in an artery leads to direct infusion of glucose into the pancreas, which causes hyperinsulinaemia {{and can lead to}} potentially dangerous nonketotic hypoglycaemia.

40|$|Background: “Less {{invasive}} surfactant therapy” (LIST), or tracheal instillation of surfactant {{through a}} small catheter in spontaneously breathing infants, is gaining popularity. Different catheters are currently used for this purpose: a nasogastric tube inserted with (LISA) or without (Take Care) Magill’s forceps, a 13 cm 16 G adult angiocath (MIST), a 30 cm F 4 angiography catheter (Stockholm). We developed a specific device by combining a F 5 <b>umbilical</b> <b>catheter</b> and an intubation stylet (Liege). We aimed to compare those 5 devices using INSURE as a reference. Methods: 20 neonatologists from 4 institutions supporting different surfactant instillation policies intubated 2 manikin heads with the 5 catheters and an endotracheal tube in a predetermined random sequence. Water was flushed trough the catheter. Video review provided times between laryngoscope (T 1) or catheter insertion (T 2) in the mouth and water flowing from the trachea. Participants gave an ease of use score (range: 1 - 9) for each catheter. Results: Procedural times were longer with the Take Care method and shorter with the Liège device (Table). Failure rates were higher for LIST procedures than for INSURE. Take Care and LISA were rated as more difficult, while Liège, Stockholm and INSURE were considered easier. Conclusions: LIST procedures remain difficult, even on a manikin. The choice of catheter is important. A device combining the rigidity of a stylet with the soft distal end of an <b>umbilical</b> <b>catheter</b> is associated with procedures of shorter duration and is considered easier by neonatologists.

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} whether peripheral arterial catheter management {{is more effective}} than umbilical arterial management in very preterm neonates. Methods: Thirty-eight very preterm neonates born in Fukushima Medical University Hospital between October 2008 and March 2010 were evaluated. A peripheral arterial catheter was inserted in 19 neonates (peripheral group) and an umbilical arterial catheter in the remaining 19 neonates (umbilical group). Results: The median gestational ages of the peripheral and umbilical groups were 195 and 185 days, respectively (p= 0. 04). The systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) was significantly higher in the peripheral group than in the umbilical group (p= 0. 03 and p= 0. 001). There was a significant relationship between BP at cannulation and urinary output after cannulation for 24 h in the peripheral group (r_s= 0. 49, p= 0. 03); however, no such significant relationship was found in the umbilical group. Conclusions: We considered that peripheral artery catheters provide a well-functioning route for continuous BP monitoring, even in very preterm neonates. Because <b>umbilical</b> <b>catheter</b> placement might affect urinary output, we speculated that peripheral arterial catheter placement would be a more effective management strategy than umbilical arterial catheter placement in very preterm neonates.

40|$|Background: Placement of endotracheal tubes (ETTs) and <b>umbilical</b> <b>catheters</b> (UCs) is {{essential}} in very preterm infant care. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the effect of an educational initiative to optimize correct placement of ETTs and UCs in very preterm infants. Methods: A pre–post study design, evaluating optimal radiological position of ETTs and UCs in the first 72 h of life in infants < 32 weeks gestational age (GA) was performed. Baseline data was obtained from a preceding 34 -month period. The study intervention consisted of information from the pre-intervention audit, surface anatomy images of the newborn for optimal UC positioning, and weight-based calculations to estimate insertion depths for endotracheal intubation. A prospective evaluation of radiological placement of ETTs and UCs was then conducted over a 12 -month period. Results: During the study period, 211 infants had at least one of the three procedures performed. One hundred and fifty-seven infants were included in the pre-education group, and 54 in the post-education group. All three procedures were performed in 50. 3 % (79 / 157) in the pre-education group, and 55. 6 % (30 / 54) in the post-education group.

40|$|Although {{umbilical}} venous catheterization is {{a routine}} procedure in premature newborns, it {{is associated with}} various, potentially life threatening, complications. We present {{a case of a}} premature baby diagnosed with a hepatic parenchymal liquid collection as a complication of umbilical vein catheterization in our Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. The child was born in the 25 th gestational week (GW) and was doing well until the 12 th day of life when his general condition deteriorated. He appeared anxious and his oxygen saturation (SaO 2) decreased. There was slight abdominal distension and tenderness over the abdominal wall, with weak bowel movements, and a palpable liver. Abdominal ultrasound (US) showed an enlarged liver with a well-defined hypoechoic area, with inhomogeneous echogenicity. Such findings were suggestive of fluid extravasation to the liver through a malpositioned umbilical venous catheter. The <b>umbilical</b> <b>catheter</b> was withdrawn, antimicrobial treatment initiated, and eventual complete regression of the collection was seen eleven days after extravasation. Rapid, unexplained clinical deterioration of a newborn with an umbilical vein catheter should always raise the suspicion of a complication due to catheterization. Such a catheter should be carefully revised and, if there is any doubt, removed. Timely diagnosis and adequate treatment is essential, and potentially life-saving...|$|E
40|$|This study {{compares the}} methods of Dunn and Shukla in {{determining}} the appropriate insertion length of umbilical catheters. In July 2007, we changed our policy for <b>umbilical</b> <b>catheter</b> insertions from the method of Dunn to the method of Shukla. We report our percentage of inaccurate placement of umbilical-vein catheters (UVCs) and umbilical-artery catheters (UACs) {{before and after the}} change of policy. In the Dunn-group, 41 % (28 / 69) of UVCs were placed directly in the correct position against 24 % (20 / 84) in the Shukla-group. The position of the catheter-tip of UVCs in the Dunn-group and the Shukla-group was too high in 57 % (39 / 69) and 75 % (63 / 84) of neonates, respectively. UACs in the Dunn-group were placed directly in the correct position in 63 % (24 / 38) compared to the 87 % (39 / 45) of cases in Shukla-group. The position of the catheter-tip of UACs in the Dunn-group and the Shukla-group was too high in 34 % (13 / 38) and 13 % (6 / 45) of neonates, respectively. In conclusion, the Dunn-method is more accurate than the Shukla-method in predicting the insertion length for UVCs, whereas the Shukla-method is more accurate for UACs...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{evaluate}} {{the accuracy of}} the simultaneous analysis of three radiographic anatomical landmarks – diaphragm, cardiac silhouette, and vertebral bodies – in determining the position of the <b>umbilical</b> venous <b>catheter</b> distal end using echocardiography as a reference standard. MethodThis was a cross-sectional, observational study, with the prospective inclusion of data from all neonates born in a public reference hospital, between April 2012 and September 2013, submitted to <b>umbilical</b> venous <b>catheter</b> insertion as part of their medical care. The position of the catheter distal end, determined by the simultaneous analysis of three radiographic anatomical landmarks, was compared with the anatomical position obtained by echocardiography; sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy were calculated. ResultsOf the 162 newborns assessed by echocardiography, only 44 (27. 16 %) had the catheter in optimal position, in the thoracic portion of the inferior vena cava or at the junction of the inferior vena cava with the right atrium. The catheters were located in the left atrium and interatrial septum in 54 (33. 33 %) newborns, in the right atrium in 26 (16. 05 %), intra-hepatic in 37 (22. 84 %), and intra-aortic in-one newborn (0. 62 %). The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the radiography to detect the catheter in the target area were 56 %, 71 %, and 67. 28 %, respectively. ConclusionAnteroposterior radiography of the chest alone is not able to safely define the <b>umbilical</b> venous <b>catheter</b> position.

40|$|Aim: Cardiac rhythm {{abnormalities}} {{associated with}} <b>umbilical</b> venous <b>catheters</b> in newborns {{are limited to}} anecdotal case reports. The present study intended to evaluate association between <b>umbilical</b> venous <b>catheter,</b> arrhythmic potential, and changes in heart rate variability. Material and Method: The study consisted of two groups; 26 preterm newborns with a <b>umbilical</b> venous <b>catheter</b> (group 1), and 26 control group without (group 2). The following parameters were recorded prospectively: gender, gestation at birth, birth weight, and clinical assessment scores (SNAP-II and SNAPPE-II). Holter recordings were fitted in all newborns. The heart rate variability study was performed by utilizing time-domain and frequency-domain analyses. Results: The study population consisted of group 1 (30. 63 ± 2. 67 weeks of gestation) and group 2 (31. 60 ± 2. 45 weeks of gestation). There was no statistical {{difference between the two}} groups for gestational age, birth weight, SNAP-II and SNAPPE- II scores. When compared for arrhythmia there was no statistical difference in any parameters between the two study groups. Premature atrial contraction was noted in 11 babies (42. 3 %) in group 1 and in 7 babies (26. 9 %) in group 2. Premature ventricular contraction was noted in 3 babies (11. 5 %) in group 1 and in one baby in group 2. Sinus tachycardia detected in 3 patients in only the group 1. None of the heart rate variability parameters were found to be statistically different between the two groups. Conclusions: Our study reassuringly demonstrated that <b>umbilical</b> venous <b>catheter</b> does not have any significant effect on arrhythmia or heart rate variability in preterm newborns.
