40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the choice between}} two rights-preserving issue methods of seasoned equity offers in the UK {{as well as the}} factors determining the offer price and stock market announcement reactions. Firstly, equity issues in the UK are <b>underwritten</b> for different reasons than in other countries. Only severely financially distressed companies choose not to <b>underwrite</b> their share offer. Second, the average announcement reaction to non-underwritten issues is much more negative than to <b>underwritten</b> issues. This contrasts sharply with the results found in other countries, such as the US. Third, <b>underwritten</b> rights issues experience a negative announcement return whereas the share price reaction to <b>underwritten</b> open offers is positive. The choice of issue method and the subsequent announcement reaction are explained by directors' and institutional investors' interests, growth opportunities, stock market uncertainty and liquidity in the market for rights. ...|$|R
5|$|More than 930,000policyholders in South Florida lost {{coverage}} after 11insurance companies went bankrupt, {{caused by}} more than 600,000insurance claims filed. This led the Florida Legislature to create new entities, such as the Joint <b>Underwriting</b> Association, the Florida Windstorm <b>Underwriting</b> Association, and the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, {{in an effort to}} restore adequate insurance capacity. Stricter building codes were created in Florida in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew. A survey by Tim Marshall and Richard Herzog of the Haag Engineer Company in Carrollton, Texas, highlighted several construction issues. On the roof of some homes, the concrete tiles were glued to felt paper, which could easily be ripped by straight line winds. At houses with shingled roofs, it was found that some of the shingles were stapled perpendicular to the long axis, also allowing them to be torn away. After the tiles or shingles were peeled off, the plywood and prefabricated trusses were exposed to the weather. Eventually, the plywood and the trusses suffered structural failure, leading to roof collapses.|$|E

5|$|The {{developments}} in Uruguay were closely watched by the Empire of Brazil, which had vital {{interests in the}} Río de la Plata Basin. After Rosas fell in 1852, Brazil became the dominant regional power. Its foreign policy included the covert <b>underwriting</b> of opposition parties in Uruguay and Argentina, preventing strong governments that might threaten Brazil's strategic position in the area. Brazilian banking and commercial firms also had ventures in the area, furthering ties within the region. In Uruguay, the bank run by Irineu Evangelista de Sousa (Baron and later Viscount of Mauá) became so heavily involved in commercial enterprises that the economy depended on this source of continued capital flow.|$|E

5|$|UBS, through Swiss Bank Corporation, traces {{its history}} to 1854 when six private banking firms in Basel, Switzerland pooled their {{resources}} {{to form the}} Bankverein, a consortium that acted as an <b>underwriting</b> syndicate for its member banks. In 1871, the Bankverein coordinated with the German Frankfurter Bankverein to form the Basler Bankverein, a joint-stock company replacing the original Bankverein consortium. After the new bank started with an initial commitment of CHF 30million and CHF 6million of share capital, it soon experienced growing pains when heavy losses in Germany caused it to suspend its dividend until 1879. Following the years 1885 and 1886, when the bank merged with the Zürcher Bankverein and acquired the Basler Depositenbank and the Schweizerische Unionbank, it {{changed its name to}} Schweizerischer Bankverein. The English name of the bank was originally Swiss Bankverein, but was changed to Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC) in 1917.|$|E
5|$|MIGA's inaugural {{investment}} guarantees {{were issued}} in 1990 to cover $1.04billion ($1.83billion in 2012dollars) worth of foreign direct investment(FDI) comprising four individual projects. The agency also issued its first reinsurance contracts signed {{in collaboration with}} Export Development Canada and the United States' Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC). That same year, MIGA held a conference in Ghana to promote investment. The agency joined the Berne Union, an international community of export credit and investment insurance providers in 1994. In 1997, MIGA issued the inaugural contract under its Cooperative <b>Underwriting</b> Program to support an energy project in Indonesia. In collaboration with the European Union Investment Trust Fund for Bosnia and Herzegovina, the agency set up a fund for investment guarantees amounting to $12million ($17million in 2012dollars). The agency also established the West Bank and Gaza Investment Guarantee Trust Fund with a capacity of $20million ($29million in 2012dollars). In 1998 the Council of Governors of MIGA adopted a resolution establishing a general capital increase of $850million ($1.2billion in 2012dollars), and transferring a grant of $150million ($212million in 2012dollars) from the IBRD. MIGA exceeded $1billion ($1.4billion in 2012 dollars) in investment guarantees within a single {{year for the first}} time in 1999.

25|$|Medical <b>underwriting</b> is {{a health}} {{insurance}} term {{referring to the}} use of medical or health information in the evaluation of an applicant for coverage, typically for life or health insurance. As part of the <b>underwriting</b> process, an individual's health information may be used in making two decisions: whether to offer or deny coverage and what premium rate to set for the policy. The two most common methods of medical <b>underwriting</b> are known as moratorium <b>underwriting,</b> a relatively simple process, and full medical <b>underwriting,</b> a more indepth analysis of a client's health information. The use of medical <b>underwriting</b> may be restricted by law in certain insurance markets. If allowed, the criteria used should be objective, clearly related to the likely cost of providing coverage, practical to administer, consistent with applicable law, and designed to protect the long-term viability of the insurance system.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the pricing characteristics of {{initial public offerings}} <b>underwritten</b> by commercial banks. Assuming IPO underpricing {{is directly related to}} ex ante uncertainty, if the market rationally perceives these commercial banks to have a conflict of interest, these securities should have more underpricing than non-commercial bank <b>underwritten</b> initial public offerings (all else being equal). On the other hand, if the market believes that commercial bank involvement signals firm quality, less underpricing should be observed. This topic has recently gained in importance {{with the passage of the}} Financial Services Reform Act in November 1999. We find that the underpricing of commercial bank <b>underwritten</b> initial public offerings in which the firm had a previous banking relationship with the underwriter is significantly less than those <b>underwritten</b> by investment banks.

25|$|The {{shift toward}} riskier {{mortgages}} and private label MBS distribution occurred as financial institutions sought to maintain earnings levels {{that had been}} elevated during 2001–2003 by an unprecedented refinancing boom due to historically low interest rates. Earnings depended on volume, so maintaining elevated earnings levels necessitated expanding the borrower pool using lower <b>underwriting</b> standards and new products that the GSEs would not (initially) securitize. Thus, the shift away from GSE securitization to private-label securitization (PLS) also corresponded with a shift in mortgage product type, from traditional, amortizing, fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) to nontraditional, structurally riskier, nonamortizing, adjustable-rate mortgages (ARM's), and in {{the start of a}} sharp deterioration in mortgage <b>underwriting</b> standards. The growth of PLS, however, forced the GSEs to lower their <b>underwriting</b> standards in an attempt to reclaim lost market share to please their private shareholders. Shareholder pressure pushed the GSEs into competition with PLS for market share, and the GSEs loosened their guarantee business <b>underwriting</b> standards in order to compete. In contrast, the wholly public FHA/Ginnie Mae maintained their <b>underwriting</b> standards and instead ceded market share.|$|E
