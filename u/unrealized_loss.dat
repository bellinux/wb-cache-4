5000|$|A {{wash sale}} (not to be {{confused}} with a wash trade) is a sale of a security (stock, bonds, options) at a loss and repurchase of the same or substantially identical security shortly before or after. [...] The regulations around wash sales are to protect against an investor who holds an <b>unrealized</b> <b>loss</b> and wishes to make it claimable as a tax deduction within the current tax year. The security is then repurchased in the hope that it will recover its previous value, which would only become taxable in some future tax year. A wash sale can take place {{at any time during the}} year. In the UK, a similar practice which specifically takes place at the end of a calendar year is known as bed and breakfasting. In a bed-and-breakfasting transaction, a position is sold on the last trading day of the year (typically late in the trading session) to establish a tax loss. The same position is then repurchased early on the first session of the new trading year, to restore the position (albeit at a lower cost basis). The term, therefore, derives its name from the late sale and early morning repurchase.|$|E

Reducing the role of minority shareholders implies also lower demand for timely loss recognition.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays on investor behavior and asset pricing. In the first chapter, I investigate the asset pricing implications of a newly-documented refinement of the disposition effect, characterized by investors being more likely to sell a security when the magnitude of their gains or losses on it increases. Motivated by behavioral evidence found among individual traders, I focus on the pricing implications of such behavior in this chapter. I find that stocks with both large unrealized gains and large <b>unrealized</b> <b>losses,</b> aggregated across investors, outperform others in the following month (monthly alpha = 0. 5 - 1 %, Sharpe ratio = 1. 6). This supports the conjecture that these stocks experience higher selling pressure, leading to lower current prices and higher future returns. This effect cannot be explained by momentum, reversal, volatility, or other known return predictors, and it also subsumes the previously-documented capital gains overhang effect. Moreover, my findings dispute {{the view that the}} disposition effect drives momentum; by isolating the disposition effect from gains versus that from losses, I find the loss side has a return prediction opposite to momentum. Overall, this study provides new evidence that investors' tendencies can aggregate to affect equilibrium price dynamics; it also challenges the current understanding of the disposition effect and sheds light on the pattern, source, and pricing implications of this behavior. The second chapter extends the study of the V-shaped disposition effect - the tendency to sell relatively big winners and big losers - to the trading behavior of mutual fund managers. We find that a 1 % increase in the magnitude of <b>unrealized</b> gains (<b>losses)</b> is associated with a 4. 2 % (1. 6 %) higher probability of selling. We link this trading behavior to equilibrium price dynamics by constructing <b>unrealized</b> gains and <b>losses</b> measures directly from mutual fund holdings. (In comparison, measures for <b>unrealized</b> gains and <b>losses</b> in chapter one are approximated by past prices and trading volumes.) We find that, consistent with the relative magnitude found in the selling behavior regressions, a 1 % increase in the magnitude of gain (loss) overhang predicts a 1. 4 (. 9) basis ppoints increase in future one-month returns. A trading strategy based on this effect can generate a monthly return of 0. 5 % controlling common return predictors, and the Sharpe ratio is around 1. 4. An overhang variable capturing the V-shaped disposition effect strongly dominates the monotonic capital gains overhang measure of previous literature in predictive return regressions. Funds with higher turnover, shorter holding period, higher expense ratios, and higher management fees are significantly more likely to manifest a V-shaped disposition effect. The third chapter studies how the recourse feature of mortgage loan has impact on borrowers' strategic default incentives and on mortgage bond market. It provides a theoretical model which builds on the structural credit risk framework by Leland (1994), and explicitly analyzes borrowers' strategic default incentives under different foreclosure laws. The key results are, while possible recourse makes the payoff in strategic default less attractive, it helps deter strategic default when house price goes down. I also examine the case when cash flow problems interact with default incentives and show that recourse can help reduce default incentives, make debt value immune to liquidity shock, and has little impact on house equity value...|$|R

40|$|Investors in {{depreciable}} assets {{used in a}} trade or business claim depreciation deductions following investment, and upon sale or other disposition of their assets are taxed on gain or loss equal to differences between amounts realized and adjusted basis. The taxation of these realized gains and losses is asymmetric: losses are deductible against ordinary income, whereas {{a portion of the}} gain on sales of personal property, and virtually all gains on sales of real property, are taxed at more favorable capital gain tax rates. Evidence from U. S. tax returns in 2012 indicates that the aggregate annual magnitude of the tax saving due to the asymmetric taxation of these gains and losses is relatively modest, roughly between $ 800 million and $ 1. 71 billion. This paper considers the policy basis of this asymmetric tax treatment, noting that depreciation rules together with the elective nature of sale and realization implies that the tax system inefficiently discourages sales of depreciable business assets on which taxpayers have unrealized gains. In order to maintain efficient reallocation of used assets it is necessary to tax realized gains rather lightly. Taxpayers with <b>unrealized</b> <b>losses</b> on depreciable property have the option of retaining or discarding the property, in the first case claiming subsequent depreciation deductions against ordinary income and in the second claiming an immediate ordinary loss. The availability of these options implies that limiting the tax rate applicable to deductions for losses on sales of {{depreciable assets}} again would also inefficiently discourage asset sales. Consequently, the elective nature of asset sales implies that an efficient system imposes asymmetric taxes on gains and losses from sales of depreciable assets...|$|R

In Chapter 2, I perform empirical tests focused on one aspect of investor usefulness of accounting information: risk-relevance.

The {{results indicate that the}} volatilities of <b>unrealized</b> gains and <b>losses</b> on available-for-sale (AFS) securities and cash-flow hedges, typically deemed beyond managers' control, are negatively associated with risk, while volatilities of OTTI losses, over which managers have relatively more control, are positively associated with risk. The results are consistent with investors perceiving the volatility of non-OTTI AFS <b>unrealized</b> gains and <b>losses</b> as relatively less important, less risky, or less risk-relevant, than the volatility of OTTI losses, and perceiving the volatility of OTTI losses as an informative signal about risk. In Chapter 3, I find that Tier 1 Capital including more components of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), as stipulated by Basel III, is no more volatile than pre-Basel-III Tier 1 Capital, and that the volatilities of the AOCI components new to Tier 1 Capital are not positively associated with risk.

The revised IAS 1 requires that all changes in equity, excluding changes in equity arising from transactions with owners, should be recognized in comprehensive income statement. Revised IAS 1 requires companies to report total comprehensive income that is a sum of net income and other comprehensive income. Total comprehensive income includes all <b>unrealized</b> gains and <b>losses</b> recognized under IFRS. Before the amendment, some of the <b>unrealized</b> gains and <b>losses</b> were shown in a statement of changes in equity but not in the income statement. We hope to answer the question whether inclusion of the components of other comprehensive income provides investors with useful information. We investigate if stock prices have an association with the components of other comprehensive income. We investigate how effective are attempts of IASB to increase the relevance of accounting information about corporate income.

In this study, we use data from annual reports and year-end reports for companies listed on the Large and Mid Cap segment at NASDAQ OMX Stockholm and that covers the years 2009 to 2011. We use two regression models to test value relevance of components of other comprehensive income. We have found some evidence that the share price statistically relates to such component of comprehensive income as the change of the fair value of cash flow hedges. This can also be interpreted as that the change of the fair value of cash flow hedges has some value relevance.
