5|$|Re-rated as a 42-gun frigate in February 1817, Aigle {{underwent}} {{repairs and}} alterations at Woolwich from March 1817. In accordance with Surveyor of the Navy, Robert Seppings' designs, in January 1820, Aigle had her square transom removed and a circular stern fitted. This gave her improved {{protection in the}} rear and allowed a better field of fire. She was subsequently laid <b>up</b> <b>then</b> repaired and cut down to a 24-gun corvette between March and July 1831. Recommissioned in August 1841 under Lord Clarence Paget, she {{was sent to the}} Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|The Persian {{force was}} {{primarily}} based around 200 triremes. It {{is not clear}} whether there were additional transport ships. The standard complement of a trireme was 200 men, including 14 marines. In the second Persian invasion of Greece, each Persian ship had carried thirty extra marines, and this was probably also true in the first invasion when the whole invasion force was apparently carried in triremes. Furthermore, the Chian ships at the Battle of Lade also carried 40 marines each. This suggests that a trireme could probably carry a maximum of 4045 soldierstriremes seem to have been easily destabilised by extra weight. If the Persian force at Naxos was similarly made <b>up,</b> <b>then</b> it would have contained somewhere in the region of 8,000 to 9,000 soldiers (in addition to many unarmed rowers).|$|E
5|$|The {{scene when}} Walter {{approaches}} Gus' house {{with plans to}} kill him ends with an extremely high crane shot of Walter standing alone {{in the middle of}} the street. MacLaren wanted that shot to be extremely effective because she believed it conveyed Walter's helplessness, insignificance and lack of experience. Although the normal crane used for such overhead shots in Breaking Bad was only 30 feet tall, MacLaren rented a 180-foot-tall crane specifically for that shot. Since the crew had only about four hours to shoot before losing the night-time hours, the crane shot was the first one they filmed. It was shot by camera operators Andrew Voegeli, with dolly grip David Jaxx Nagro and gaffer Steven Litecky. Later, for the scene when Walter meets with Mike at a bar, MacLaren backlit Walter as he entered so only his silhouette would be visible when he entered. When the shots of Mike punching Walter was originally filmed, the staging involved Mike standing <b>up,</b> <b>then</b> Walter standing <b>up,</b> <b>then</b> Mike suddenly punching him. Vince Gilligan edited the scene to have Mike simply punch Walter instead to make the action faster and more surprising. The scene was arranged by stunt coordinator Al Goto, and actors Bryan Cranston and Jonathan Banks performed the stunts themselves. Mike kicks Walter several times after he falls, and Goto placed a large sandbag against Cranston's torso for Banks to kick during those scenes.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{recognizing}} Dr. Fell in {{the surveillance}} tape, Pazzi accesses the ViCAP database of wanted fugitives. He then learns of Verger's US$3 million personal bounty on Lecter. Blinded by greed, Pazzi ignores Starling's warnings {{and attempts to}} capture Lecter alone. He recruits a pickpocket to obtain Lecter's fingerprint to show Verger as proof. The pickpocket, mortally wounded by Lecter, manages to get the print and gives it to Pazzi. Lecter baits Pazzi into an isolated room of the Palazzo Vecchio, ties him <b>up,</b> <b>then</b> disembowels and hangs him. Lecter then heads back to the United States.|$|E
5|$|When Kosovo {{was under}} the {{administration}} of the United Nations, the UN flag was flown in Kosovo. However, the flag used by the Kosovar Albanian population was the Albanian flag. The Albanian flag was also used on public buildings, even though it was against UN regulations. Regulations stated only the UN flag and other authorised flags, like those of cities, could fly on public buildings. If the Albanian flag did have to go <b>up,</b> <b>then</b> the Serbian flag must go up too, according to UN regulations. However, this was never done in practice and the flag of Albania was ever-present in Kosovo during the UNMIK period.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the chief}} {{measures}} by which Ranavalona maintained order within her realm was through the traditional practice of trial by the ordeal of tangena. A poison was extracted from the nut of the native tangena (Tanghinia venenifera) shrub and ingested, with the outcome determining innocence or guilt. If nobles or freemen were compelled to undergo the ordeal, the poison was typically administered to the accused only after dog and rooster stand-ins had already died from the poison's effects, while {{among members of the}} slave class (andevo), the ordeal required them to immediately ingest the poison themselves. The accused would be fed the poison along with three pieces of chicken skin: if all three pieces of skin were vomited <b>up</b> <b>then</b> innocence was declared, but death or a failure to regurgitate all three pieces of skin indicated guilt. According to 19th-century Malagasy historian Raombana, {{in the eyes of the}} greater populace, the tangena ordeal was believed to represent a sort of celestial justice in which the public placed their unquestioning faith, even to the point of accepting a verdict of guilt in a case of innocence as a just but unknowable divine mystery.|$|E

25|$|Starting circa 1972, on the PLATO system, emoticons {{and other}} {{decorative}} graphics were produced as ASCII art, particularly with overprinting: typing a character, backing <b>up,</b> <b>then</b> typing another character.

This developed into a sophisticated set, particularly in combination with superscript and subscript.|$|E

25|$|David Webster, {{a critic}} of the megadrought theory, says that much of the {{evidence}} provided by Gill comes from the northern Yucatán and not {{the southern part of the}} peninsula, where Classic Maya civilization flourished.

That Gill suggests that all water in the region would have dried up and destroyed Maya civilization is a stretch, according to Webster.|$|E
