40|$|Urban fringes {{represent}} {{very complex}} landscapes {{because of their}} proximity and mutual dependency with cities and rural areas. These landscapes may be considered as transition entities characterized by fuzzy boundaries.

Thus, urban fringes assume a key-role in modern landscape analysis, planning and management. Landscape analysis of these interfaces, as this study shows, can be effectively supported by GIS spatial modelling. The Settlement Density Index (SDI), developed through GIS spatial analysis techniques, expresses punctually the territorial gradients generated {{by the presence of}} settlements and allows the identification of the urban fringes in the two periods under invest-tigation.

40|$|Abstract [...] - The {{cities are}} growing in all {{directions}} resulting in <b>urban</b> <b>sprawl</b> and it is governed by geographic and socio-economic factors such as population growth, policy and economic development. <b>Uncontrolled</b> momentum of <b>urban</b> <b>sprawl</b> and land use change raises many issues which might have {{both positive and negative}} impacts. This sprawl can be effectively monitored using remotely sensed data from different dates by digital analysis of the imagery using change detection techniques. The present attempt aims to examine the change in demography, landuse /landcover (LU/LC) over a time point and assesses the pattern of sprawl through Geoinformatic technique in the fringe area of Madurai city. The geographical a real extend of Madurai fringe is 120. 95 sq. km. It consist of 24 villages out of it 15 villages with 6 urban centers falls in the northern part and 9 including 3 urban centers falls in the southern part and it holds the total population of about 3, 02, 270 persons (Census, 2001). The spatio-temporal study of LU/LC is carried out for two time points 1997 and 2007. The data source used for analysis is IRS LISS pan merged (NRSC) and Geoeye imageries (Google Earth). The analysis mainly focused the demographic changes along with landuse / landcover changes. The degree of impact on fringe areas is inferred from the analysis. The trend of sprawl is notably high in the urban centers than in the revenue villages in both the sides of the fringe of Madurai city.

40|$|This work, {{that is part}} of {{a current}} research, is aimed to tackle the problem of <b>uncontrolled</b> city growth. <b>Urban</b> <b>sprawl</b> has {{recently}} become a critical issue not only from the spatial point of view, but also for overcrowding. The main objective {{of this study is to}} point out the need for a proper planning of the largest urban areas in the world by means of a strategic project. Also, the need for a functional organization of the so-called slums is worth considering. Slums are usually left out from the well-organized urban system. Although they can easily be identified within the city, they are not formally recognized from the perspective of soil occupation and the related social issues. In the light of this, planners are increasingly given important responsibilities as well as a set of different tasks. In fact, besides the multi-disciplinary approach, they should deepen the correlation between space and the population. The explosion of megacities, along with the prospect of further settlements in the world, involve a mixture of people, cultures, religions, education, interests, and technologies which undermine the traditional planning methodologies. In fact, this situation affects the functional integration and the development of a participatory process. This current research will provide new methods and new models so as to analyze the phenomenon, both large-scale and the small-scale aspects. ...|$|R

While these lands are often high agronomical potential, they are most often permanently lost. To better understand the dynamics of consumption of these agricultural lands by artificial surfaces and to have spatial tools to argue the risk of permanent loss of agronomical potential heritage, the Regional Direction of Food, Agriculture and Forestry of Languedoc-Roussillon has commissioned a study from research institutions: INRA for the agronomical theme and Cemagref for the spatial information and analysis. In order to quantify and qualify agricultural land changes, a methodology intended to build a system of spatial and spatialized indicators is being developed.

A concept about planning one large-scale greenbelt surrounding the central city is proposed by the local government, {{which is expected to}} both control urban sprawl and improve environments. The objective of this research is to analyze the existing land use/cover pattern within the proposed greenbelt zone, and evaluate the land potential for greenbelt development. The results show that the current landscape pattern provides considerable potential for greenbelt development. Totally, all the undeveloped land resources occupied more than 60 %, while the developed builtup areas occupied less than 40 %. All these undeveloped land resources might be available for green space development if with strict control for transforming into built-ups in the future. In addition, the major transportation routes passing the greenbelt are found as the important factor for large built-ups increase. These transportation routes are suggested as the major axes to formulate a wedgebased greenbelt pattern design, which might efficiently regulate and control the rapid large-scale built-ups development. However, various existing built-up lands developed without regular pattern, and go against the greenbelt requirement. How to regulate existing land uses, increase land use efficiency, freeze built-ups development, and release some developed lands would be the key for successful greenbelt development...|$|E

This paper analyzes spatiotemporal trends in urban development of four municipalities in Goa, India. Landscape metrics were conducted based on urban land use classification. In the last decade, Goa has experienced rapid urbanization, which has been closely linked to their paralleled expansion in the tourism industry corresponding to the largest sector of the state's economy. Tourism development and policy in Goa largely focus on coastal regions, leading to a decline in tourist activity further inland. This has accelerated urban development and put pressure on the coastal landscapes. Current planning policies implemented by the state suggests that proper attention is given to mitigation of anthropogenic activity, however the dynamics of the urban sprawl continue to be uncontrolled and sporadic. Thus, sustainable development is crucial to the continued welfare of the state, and particularly within the reach of economic drivers such as tourism in Goa. The methods and techniques adopted in this paper, combine spatial metrics along with urban footprints, to obtain a complex understanding of the impacts urban development has on potentially vulnerable coastal stretches. The increase of urban areas has been predominantly found along the existing historical urban areas of Goa and the implementation of landscape metrics has allowed to shape an objective vision of the consequences of Goa's urbanization processes along its vulnerable coastal stretches...|$|E

Even though, the storm-water pollution from impervious surfaces (building sites, roads, parking lots, etc.) is increasing due to <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>urban</b> <b>sprawl</b> and high frequency hydrological events, the treatment of storm-water pollution is almost negligible, unlike in developed countries such as Australia and United States (Roy et al. 2008). Secondly, the population density has grown to nearly 900 persons/km 2 in the study area, with {{more than half of the}} population residing in rural areas, where wastwater collection is usually difficult and not cost-effective. Therefore, decentralized treatment of household sewage is necessary in rural areas for local water quality management (Ichinari et al. 2008). In addition, unreasonable sluice regulation has proven to be a potential cause of increase in water pollution. Especially in pre-flood season, most dams and sluices in Ying River basin are opened to discharge stored water for flood control. The sudden release of accumulated pollutant concentrations in tributaries greatly destroys the water environment of lower trunk stream. Dam removal can help in providing an effective means for restoring river habitat in the developed areas (Foley et al. 2015). However, it cannot be applied to developing areas with rising demand for power and water. Therefore, considering the fact that water pollution level and seasonal variation pattern is different in the basin, scientific joint operation of water projects ameliorating the influence of upstream water on the downstream water quality and tributary water on the mainstream water quality could be provided as an effective solution for Ying River basin management.|$|E

As a matter of fact, forest expansion is the only natural process that may counteract the consumption of the ecosystem capital and ecosystems services of rural lands due to <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>urban</b> <b>sprawl.</b> The paper addresses this topic in the paradigmatic case study of the countryside of Rome (Italy), characterized by counter dynamics of forest expansion and suburbanization. Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA) is applied to classify the forest landscape structure twice (1974 and 2008) according to seven categories (core, islet, perforation, edge, loop, bridge, branch) with different potential functional role as elements of a green infrastructure. Main findings are: (i) forest cover increased from 11 % to 16 % between 1974 and 2008; forest land uptake exceeds 4 % of total study area, but shows a slower pace than the growth of built-up areas (10 %); (ii) forest expansion has been to a large extent achieved by “sprawling” of islets (1. 6 % of the study area) along the stream network; (iii) more compact forest expansion has taken place on 0. 2 % of the study area in the form of additions to existing core areas or creation of new ones and (iv) the establishment of a network of protected areas nearby Rome has played a key role for the conservation and further expansion of core areas; yet, local loss of 1974 core areas stocks in a few protected areas indicates need of further law enforcement to ensure effective protection of the natural capital from degradation processes or even land conversion into built-up areas. Results calls for future in-depth investigations on the quality of newly created or maintained forest resource stocks associated to different spatial pattern structures. Integrated spatial planning strategies are outlined for the conservation of ecosystem capital and ecosystems services provided by forests, as major components of Rome’s green infrastructure.

It is difficult {{not to look at}} the past while striving for perfection, as history teaches about what once was considered as success and failure in the process of urban development. The image of the ideal city is shaped by the care of the needs of current users and future generations. Ideal city is one that boldly puts the steps towards the future, opening up for new opportunities created by the development of science and technology. It opposes the often negative phenomena, which in the future can worsen, leading among other things to the loss of relationships within the society. In view of these risks, questions arise about tomorrow, about the fate of social spaces and public areas. Will the man of the future benefit from them? Will he replace them with virtual world? It seems that without the knowledge of the past and that is the experience of the builders of the cities of foregone eras and the directions of development of former trends it is impossible to shape the present, guided by one primary purpose - to serve the modern man, realizing his basic needs important for living and those which can be defined as more than basic, associated with personal preferences and ambitions. The future we want to know focuses on the experience of the past while trying to create local conditions today. Today is suspended between what has already happened and what will happen. Today is also a time to reflect on what is good and worthy of follow-up, and what constitutes a threat. Today triggers the need to seek remedies to all of the negative phenomena leading to <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>urban</b> <b>sprawl,</b> deepening of the spatial chaos, increasing suburbanization and mental anonymity of both the residents and space. The city in-between {{is the city}} standing at the threshold of modernity, creating a vision of the future on the canvas of not always positive experience that have taken place in the past...|$|E
40|$|Istanbul {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{metropolis}} of the world, standing upon two continents, but its modern history, which is linked to planning exercise, can be traced back the beginning of the last century. In fact, the industrialization was the most attractive factor for people without job, living in the underdeveloped rural regions of the country, bringing serious problems to the city: urban sprawl, unemployment, insufficient infrastructures and public services and, over all, the illegal settlements called gegekondu (built-in-a-night houses), located in the outskirts of the urban area. In general, the growth goes over forward three branches, which are population, land use and transportation network, but it is possible to recognize in the linear form the influence of mobility factors: ferry, railways and highways. The current structure of the metropolitan area of Istanbul clearly shows the relationship between the mobility system and an <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>urban</b> <b>sprawl.</b> Starting from 1950 public investments have been oriented towards the construction of urban highways as an answer to the increasing exodus of rural population and to the related occupation of urban soils. In this sense, many authors underline how the proposed solutions and the reasons of the problems paradoxically tend to coincide. On the other hand, planning tools which have been used in the past have proved ineffective and have produced a largely illegal and ungovernable city. In fact, it is possible to describe the evolution of city planning as a result of the difficult to apply planning and development tools successfully experienced in the European countries but not adequately conceived with regards to the local social and economic structure of Istanbul. In particular, polycentrism, which has been largely evocated in planning tools – think of Sir Patrick Abercrombie’s proposals, at the middle of the Fifties, or of Luigi Piccinato’s plan of the metropolitan area (1969) – has constantly exceeded by the diffusion of illegal settlements. It probably means that changes are faster than the duration required for the processes which are used in planning and transportation organization. Also the new tools, as strategic plan and urban project, seem to show their limits. A larger integration between still sectoral urban policies can contribute to the definition of innovative approaches. An example is given by the pilot project “Street are Ours, One Day a Month”: the slogan “moving people is more important than moving cars” clearly shows the “communicative” dimension of the initiative, aimed at the experimentation of innovative forms of alternative mobility in the framework of a broader involvement of inhabitants in planning choices. In this sense, the pilot project is oriented towards a reinforcement of the meanings related to the concept of proximity, involving not only mobility issues, but also those of community and local identity...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{increasing}} <b>urban</b> <b>sprawl</b> in {{most cities}} {{in developing countries}} continues to attract attention of national and international agencies but the efforts had not achieved much result at checking the sprawl. There is the need therefore to re-evaluate these efforts and make necessary suggestions that would reverse the trend. This study investigates the problems of <b>urban</b> <b>sprawl</b> in Nigeria. It utilizes published and unpublished materials as well as sundry informal investigations (i. e. observations) of the stakeholders {{in the development and}} management of <b>urban</b> <b>sprawl</b> in Nigerian cities. The paper presents the urbanization trends in Nigeria and discusses the characteristic features of <b>urban</b> <b>sprawl</b> in its cities as well as identifies the various factors responsible for the <b>urban</b> <b>sprawl.</b> It evaluates strategies adopted so far at curtailing the sprawl. A major limitation of the various strategies adopted is the inadequate involvement of the people (developers) at checking the sprawl. The paper therefore suggests a people-oriented strategy in checking <b>urban</b> <b>sprawl</b> in Nigerian cities; which is expected to be facilitated by the government planning officials...|$|R
40|$|Recently {{a number}} of studies have focused on <b>urban</b> <b>sprawl</b> in the Iranian cities and the {{negative}} impacts of such development pattern. Although in a general view the phrase “urban sprawl” is used for fast and sometimes uncontrolled urbanizations, but there are dissimilarities between the <b>urban</b> <b>sprawl</b> in the western societies with the so-called Iranian <b>urban</b> <b>sprawl.</b> This paper discusses these differences as part of five main aspects that are mentioned in the internationally recognized <b>urban</b> <b>sprawl</b> definitions. Suburban sprawl, single-use developments/zoning, disconnected street network, low accessibility of the new developments, and commercial strip development are the aspects that are descriptively discussed as the main differences between the two types of sprawl. The main point of the discussion is that due to the wide range of similarities, which are briefly introduced, the type of the fast outward urban growth that is observed in the periphery of the Iranian cities can be defined as a part of the universal <b>urban</b> <b>sprawl</b> trend. Finally a definition is suggested for explaining <b>urban</b> <b>sprawl</b> in Iran...|$|R
40|$|<b>Urban</b> <b>sprawl</b> is the {{outgrowth}} {{along the}} periphery of cities and along highways. Although an accurate definition of <b>urban</b> <b>sprawl</b> may be debated, a consensus is that <b>urban</b> <b>sprawl</b> is characterized by an unplanned and uneven pattern of growth, driven by multitude of processes and leading to inefficient resource utilization. Urbanization in India has never been as rapid {{as it is in}} recent times. As {{one of the fastest growing}} economies in the world, India faces stiff challenges in managing the <b>urban</b> <b>sprawl,</b> while ensuring effective delivery of basic services in urban areas. The urban areas contribute significantly to the national economy (more than 50...|$|R
