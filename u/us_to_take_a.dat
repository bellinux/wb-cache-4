5|$|The {{effects of}} the winter {{came at a time}} of heavy {{government}} spending with 15per cent of the GDP being spent on the armed forces and large expenditure on the new National Health Service and post-war reconstruction. This made the currency less stable and, coupled with the emergence of the dollar as the currency of choice for foreign reserves, led the government to slash the Bretton Woods official exchange rate from $4.03 to $2.80. This was a major event in Britain's decline from superpower status. With the country struggling to feed its people at home and those it was responsible for in war-torn Europe, it also caused the <b>US</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> greater interest in Europe and push through the Marshall Plan for assistance to Britain and the continent. In addition, the winter is cited as the reason for the emigration of thousands of British people, particularly to Australia. The winter as a whole was less cold than the winter of 1963 but more snow was recorded.|$|E

25|$|Looking {{for ways}} around the deadlock, Henry Tizard sent Archibald Vivian Hill to the <b>US</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> survey of US {{technical}} capability {{in order to}} better assess what technologies the US would be willing to exchange. This effort was the start on the path that led to the famous Tizard Mission in late August 1940. Ironically, by the time the Mission was being planned, the Norden had been removed from the list of items to be discussed, and Roosevelt personally noted this was due largely to political reasons. Ultimately, although Tizard was unable to convince the US to release the design, he was able to request information about its external dimensions and details on the mounting system so it could be easily added to British bombers if it were released in the future.|$|E

We specify and estimate a five-simultaneous-equation model with two retirement equations, two separate leisure equations, and an equation for joint leisure.

30|$|For {{our purpose}} of {{attempting}} to integrate the study of social, economic and political institutions, in this section, we characterize the output as development in its broadest sense: an index capturing weighted growth in social, economic and political variables defined each period by social, economic and political institutions. Taking such a broad view allows <b>us</b> <b>to</b> elaborate on how steering institutions influence a society’s development and how they respond to social feedback. In other words, it permits <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> integrated view of institutional influence on society.

30|$|These two opposites, but concomitant, spatial {{dynamics}} have led <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> {{interest in the}} factors that determine the location of logistics activities. These spatial issues question urban policies and underline a partial knowledge of the logistics sectors. Indeed, {{one of the major}} issues for the planning of logistics facilities is a good understanding of logistics as an industry sector. The great heterogeneity of logistics services and their corresponding facilities is rarely taken into account in the academic literature, or by public policymakers. The visibility of specific sectors, such as parcel industry or e-commerce, hides other sides of the logistics sector and could lead to a misrepresentation of what services are provided and how to plan for the location of their services.|$|R

40|$|We {{generate}} an original dataset on bribe payments at two competing ports in Southern Africa that allows <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> unusually {{close look at}} the relationship between bureaucratic organization, bribe-setting behavior and the costs corruption imposes on users of public services. We find that the way bureaucracies are organized can generate different opportunities for bureaucrats to engage in "collusive" or "coercive" types of corruption. We then observe how firms adjust their shipping and sourcing strategies in response to different types of corruption. "Collusive" corruption is cost-reducing for firms, increasing usage of the corrupt port, while "coercive" corruption is cost-increasing, reducing demand for port services. Our findings therefore suggest that firms respond to the opportunities and challenges created by different types of corruption, organizing production in a way that increases or decreases demand for the public service. ...|$|R
