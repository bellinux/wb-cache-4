40|$|AbstractGlobal {{petroleum}} exploration {{is currently}} undergoing a strategic shift from conventional to <b>unconventional</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> resources. Unconventional hydrocarbons in tight reservoirs show characteristics distinct {{from those of}} conventional hydrocarbon sources hosted in structural and stratigraphic traps. The characteristic features include the following: a hydrocarbon source and reservoir coexist; porosity and permeability are ultra-low; nano-pore throats are widely distributed; hydrocarbon-bearing reservoir bodies are continuously distributed; there is no obvious trap boundary; buoyancy and hydrodynamics have only a minor effect, and Darcy's law does not apply; phase separation is poor; there is no uniform oil–gas–water interface or pressure system; and oil or gas saturation varies. Examples of <b>unconventional</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> accumulations are the Mesozoic tight sandstone oil province and the Upper Paleozoic tight sandstone gas province in the Ordos Basin, north-central China. Generally, continuous hydrocarbon accumulation over a large area is a distinguishing characteristic of <b>unconventional</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> sources.

40|$|The {{extraction}} of <b>unconventional</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> particularly through hydraulic fracturing (‘fracking’), has generated both support and opposition {{in many countries}} around the globe.

One putative solution – ‘landfarming’ – is a disposal process that involves spreading oil and gas waste on to land and mixing it with topsoil to allow bioremediation of the hydrocarbons. This paper examines the case of landfarming in New Zealand where the practice has proved controversial due to its association with fracking, fears about the contamination of agricultural land and potential danger to milk supplies. Drawing upon Gieryn’s notion of cultural cartography and boundary work as well as the literature on the politics of scale it analyses the struggles for epistemic authority regarding the safety of landfarming. The case has wider implications in terms of the management of waste from non-conventional hydrocarbons as well as other environmental issues in which the politics of scale figure in contested knowledge claims...|$|R

Abstract Increasing demand for alternative energy sources leads to an interest in <b>unconventional</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> e. g. natural shale gas. Based on initial evaluation, the Early Silurian graptolite shales are studied as prospective shale gas sources in the Baltic region. This paper addresses the occurrence, generation potential and the volume of unconventional gas in place. New organic geochemistry data and vitrinite like macerals reflectance meas-urements, incorporated with well logs and core data were used to reveal the potential for shale gas. The Early Silurian shales are organically rich, type II, oil–prone marine sediments. The organic matter content ranges from 0. 7 up to 19. 2 %. Hydrocarbon generation potential ranges from 7 up to 113 kg HC/t rock, and the Hydrogen Index ranges from 136 up to 571 mg HC/g TOC. Maturity of the organic matter increases southwestwards from 0. 6 up to 1. 94 % (R o). The Early Silurian shales in Western Lithuania generated large amounts of hydrocarbons with an estimated volume of expelled hydrocarbons of about 13. 75 × 106 kg.

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been {{increasing}} focus on the economic and other benefits {{of the development of}} “unconventional” sources of oil—resources that cannot be produced using traditional production techniques—partly due to the increased scarcity of conventional oil reserves. This paper compares and contrasts unconventional oil resources in Canada and Argentina. Canada has deposits of bitumen known as oil sands/tar sands. Bitumen is “a thick, sticky form of crude oil that is so heavy and viscous that it will not flow unless it is heated or diluted with lighter hydrocarbons” (Government of Alberta 2009), and when mixed with sand and clay, is known as the oil sands. In Argentina there are shale oil formations, which is crude oil found in low-permeability rock formations. The <b>unconventional</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> in Canada (the oil sands) and Argentina (shale oil) are significant resources for both countries, especially when compared with their conventional reserves. Though the institutional structure is different in both countries—Canada’s oil and gas and transportation companies are privately-owned, whereas in Argentina, they are partially government owned—the rhetoric of the discussions seems to be similar in both countries: many are in favor of development due to the significance of the economic benefits. However, in both countries, the development of transport infrastructure has been hindered by different factors, on environmental grounds, notably with regard to concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions (in Canada) and lacking sufficient planning capabilities and institutional framework for long-term investments such as railroads (in Argentina) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{large-scale}} {{extraction of}} <b>unconventional</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> in the United States {{has led to}} fears of methane contamination of shallow groundwaters. Differentiating between the deep gas released during extraction (shale gas, coal bed methane and underground coal gasification) and natural shallow-sourced methane is imperative for the monitoring and managing of environmental risks related to the extraction process. Here, for the first time, we present measurements of the major gas, and stable and noble gas isotope composition of coal bed methane (CBM) from central Scotland and coal mine methane (CMM) from central England, UK. The molecular (C 1 /(C 2 +C 3) = 21 to 120) and stable isotope compositions (δ 13 CCH 4 = - 39. 5 to - 51. 1 ‰; δDCH 4 = - 163 to - 238 ‰) indicate a thermogenic origin for the methane. They are distinct from the majority of shallow-sourced gases in UK. Both sample suites exhibit high He concentrations (338 to 2980 ppmv) that are considerably above atmospheric and groundwater levels. Simple modelling shows that these high 4 He concentrations cannot be solely derived from in situ production since coal deposition, and hence the majority {{is derived from the}} surrounding crust. The Scottish CBM contains a resolvable mantle He, Ne and Ar contribution that may originate from melts in the deep crust, demonstrating the UK coals have acted as a store for deep volatiles for 10 s of millions of years.

40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} of the exploration and exploitation of <b>unconventional</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> requires innovative skills to allow a better characterization of natural fracture networks and fracability of the rocks at depth. Within this context, we bring into focus a multi-azimuth inversion methodology to give clues about the "sweet spots" characterization through the Barnett Shales formation. To achieve our goal we used an isotropic model-based stratigraphic seismic inversion, considering a series of azimuthal sectors to build partial seismic stacks required as input of the workflow. The initial seismic survey was recorded over a surface of approximately 100 square miles to image the Barnett Shales formation, of about 150 ft thickness only and localized in a transition zone between {{the oil and gas}} window. A preliminary processing task was to define limits of azimuthal and incidence angle sectors to build several multi-azimuth post-stack and pre-stack seismic datasets. Two exploration wells with a set of log data are available in the interest area helping in the model a priori building and in the well-to-seismic calibration, both crucial steps to apply the inversion workflow. We first perform full post-stack and pre-stack usual inversion to help in finding sets of best inversion parameters, then we do the multi-azimuth post-stack and pre-stack inversion workflow using the same previous sets of parameters for each azimuthal sector. Consequently a series of acoustic impedance, P- and S-wave elastic impedance cubes are computed for each azimuthal sector. Another aspect of the study is the quantification of azimuthal variations using an ellipse fitting algorithm giving, for each bin of the interest volume, the ratio (between major and minor axes) and tilt (i. e. azimuth from the East) of the ellipse. Results showed up to 10 % of anisotropy for impedances in the Barnett Shales. We go a step further computing geomechanical features like Poisson's ratio and brittleness coefficient within the Barnett Shales and we quantified their azimuthal variations. Some areas present lower Poisson's ratio and higher brittleness than other parts. It may suggest that the latter are "sweet spots" that could be more easily stimulated by induced fracturing...|$|R

40|$|Currently in Russia and {{the world}} due to the {{depletion}} of old highly productive deposits, the role of hard-to-recover and <b>unconventional</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> is increasing. Thanks to scientific and technical progress, it became possible to involve in the development very low permeable reservoirs and even synthesize oil and gas in-situ. Today, wells serve {{not only for the}} production of hydrocarbons, but also are important elements of stimulation technology, through which the technogenic effect on the formation is carried out in order to intensify inflows. In this context, the reservoir itself can be considered as a raw material for the application of stimulation technologies, and the set of wells through which it is technologically affected is a plant or a fabric whose intermediate product is the stimulated zone of the formation and the final product is reservoir hydrocarbons. Well-established methods for studying hydrocarbon deposits are limited to the definition of standard geological parameters, which are commonly used for reserves calculations (net pay, porosity, permeability, oil and gas saturation coefficient, area), but they are clearly insufficient to characterize the development possibilities using modern stimulation technologies. To study objects that are promising for the production of hydrocarbons, it is necessary to develop fundamentally new approaches that make it possible to assess the availability of resources depending on the technologies used, and to improve the methods for forecasting and evaluating the properties of the stimulated zone of the formation. «In-situ reservoir fabric» is a collective term that combines a combination of technologies, research and methodological approaches aimed at creating and evaluating a stimulated zone of the formation by applying modern methods of technogenic impact on objects containing hard-to-recover and «unconventional» hydrocarbons in order to intensify inflows from them hydrocarbons.

40|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{challenges}} facing the energy industry, from decreased access to sovereign reserves, to declining fields, innovation challenges, increased regulation and new energy policies. These challenges pose a threat to the basic industry structure. Oil & gas companies espouse four common industry-wide strategies of Portfolio Management, Operational Efficiency, Financial Management and Sustainability-of which the first three are core operating strategies of oil & gas companies. The companies have derived their profitability, growth, and shareholder returns based on the superior execution of these strategies. Though talk about Sustainability is a business imperative, it is no longer a differentiating factor and is not integrated with the core strategies. The current challenges facing the energy industry, however, necessitate that the companies integrate sustainability, innovation and management of technology strategies with their core strategies of portfolio management, operational efficiency and financial management. In this thesis, we propose two distinct strategic options: Total Life Cycle Management and Management of Technology. Environmental management and organizational efficiency are an integral component of both the strategic options. Through Total Life Cycle Management, the companies address challenges of continued access to easier to develop and produce reserves and legacy fields, efficiencies, costs and hosts expectations. The key components of Total Life Cycle Management constitute Portfolio Management with enhanced relational strategies with the hosts, Operational Efficiency with continuous business process innovations, Sustainability with focus on long-term energy needs of the hosts and Financial Management with focused capital allocation to build scale and synergies in a region. Management of Technology strategies address the innovation challenges to tap the next big reserves in ultra deep water, arctic, <b>unconventional</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> etc. These strategies will provide differentiation on capabilities to better identify, develop, and deploy technologies. Key components of the Management of Technology strategy include R&D strategy, innovation fronts, organizational efficiency and operational performance. Companies can position themselves either as a cost- and efficiency-driven company, or as a technology-driven company-or both provided they have different organizations managing the two distinct options.

40|$|The fossil {{resource}} base is vast and can supply the world’s energy demand {{for quite some}} time in terms of potential amounts available in the subsurface. However, when regarding the increasing energy requirements for production of these resources, feasible amounts may very well be {{only a fraction of the}} total. The analyzed data by the IEA indicates that gas requirements and other inputs are increasing for the production of conventional oil and gas; energy requirements for coal production are stagnating. For processing of fossil fuels, energy inputs were decreasing over time. Case studies on unconventional oil production show that a larger amount of energy is required than for the production of conventional oil, due to the lower physical quality of the <b>unconventional</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> These resources can be upgraded to higher quality products that are comparable with conventional products, although at an energy cost. These upgrading and retorting processes make up the largest part of upstream energy requirement for unconventional resources, although they mainly consist of internally provided bitumen or kerogen. Case studies on unconventional gas also show an increase in energy requirements compared to conventional gas. These changes mainly occur due to the decreasing reservoir quality and the need for unconventional methods as hydraulic fracturing. The energy requirements for conventional and unconventional fossil resource production are incorporated in the TIMER model using an input output energy approach. The effects of the interdependent fossil resource production systems are analyzed by looking at the global primary energy use and CO 2 emissions towards 2100. Baseline scenario results show that the changes made induce 13 % higher annual primary energy use in 2100 than projected in the original model. Corresponding annual CO 2 emissions are projected to be 13. 5 % higher in 2100. These results add more pressure on efforts to sequestrate emissions. Mitigation scenarios are simulated by imposing a carbon tax on CO 2 emissions, either on direct emissions only, or on both direct and indirect emissions that result from upstream energy losses. The relative differences in energy use and emissions between the original and enhanced model are smaller than in the baseline scenario due to substitution effects, but only when the carbon tax incorporated upstream energy losses. Imposing only a direct carbon tax leaves annual CO 2 emissions at a level of 15 % higher towards 2100 compared to the original model. This indicates that it would be beneficial to incorporate fuel life cycle losses, when designing effective mitigation strategies...|$|R
