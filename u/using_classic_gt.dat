40|$|This was {{the most}} {{challenging}} yet rewarding academic endeavor that I have completed to date. Its planning, development, and implementation were possible only {{with the help of}} many kind and committed individuals. I am also deeply grateful for the funding I received from the U. S. National Security Education Program. I want to begin by thanking my primary advisor Professor Fredline M'Cormack Hale, who inspired me from start to finish. Despite her personal and professional commitments, she made time to help me develop and realize this project and introduced me to 'bigger ' thinking and new ideas that helped to give this thesis shape. I am also extremely thankful for my secondary advisor, Professor Edislav Manetovic. He spent precious time supporting my effort to work through ideas and helped me to relinquish the fear of thinking for myself. I also extend my gratitude to Dr. Markus Hahne. He introduced me to the idea of <b>using</b> <b>classic</b> <b>GT,</b> which I believe helped me to see things that may not have otherwise been visible. He was extremely generous with his time before and during my trip to Nairobi and provided me with a wealth of information about Somali culture. I am als...|$|E
40|$|The authors’ {{main purpose}} {{of the book is}} to provide {{practical}} guidance for novice researchers <b>using</b> <b>classic</b> grounded theory (<b>GT)</b> while remaining as true as possible to Glaser’s and Strauss’ thoughts.

40|$|The Grounded Theory Perspective III: Theoretical Coding, Barney G. Glaser (Sociology Press, 2005). Not {{intended}} for a beginner, this book further defi nes, describes, and explicates the <b>classic</b> grounded theory (<b>GT)</b> method. Perspective III lays out various facets of theoretical coding as Glaser meticulously distinguishes <b>classic</b> <b>GT</b> from other subsequent methods. Developed {{many years after}} Glaser’s <b>classic</b> <b>GT,</b> these methods, particularly as described by Strauss and Corbin, adopt the grounded theory name and engender ongoing confusion about the very premises of grounded theory. Glaser distinguishes between <b>classic</b> <b>GT</b> and the adscititious methods in his writings, referring to remodeled grounded theory and its offshoots as Qualitative Data Analysis (QDA) models...|$|R
40|$|The author {{reduces the}} {{research}} rationale of <b>classic</b> grounded theory (<b>GT)</b> methodology and the consequential <b>classic</b> <b>GT</b> research procedures and stages {{down to their}} essential elements. This reduction {{makes it possible to}} compare <b>classic</b> <b>GT</b> to other research methodologies {{in a manner that is}} simpler and yet concise. This methodological analysis and synthesis has been conducted while applying and after having applied the <b>classic</b> <b>GT</b> methodology in practice in a major project. The fundamental differences between <b>classic</b> <b>GT</b> versus other adaptations of GT, as well as other qualitative-inductive research approaches, are mainly explained by the very different approaches in solving the problem of many equally justifiable interpretations of the same data, and by the consequential differences in research procedures, and how they are applied. Comprehension of methodological differences in details will always be relevant. However, an uncomplicated and still concise explanation of the differences between these methodologies is necessary. “Grounded theory” (GT) is used as a common label in the literature for very different research approaches. This simpler approach of comparing the methodologies will be helpful for researchers, who might want to consider several options when deciding which research methodology to use, and who need quickly to understand some of the most essential methodological elements...|$|R

40|$|After {{having read}} Antoinette McCallin’s paper on {{literature}} use in GT I find myself asking the following question. Is McCallin’s way of applying the literature letting the research area emerge in a literature search an important modification {{on how to}} use the literature in <b>classic</b> <b>GT</b> according to Glaser? McCallin shows how her way to a one core variable grounded theory went over a literature review in the beginning of her research. But this literature review was actually a general literature search for a problem area to explore since McCallin tells us that she did not have a finite area of research before screening the literature. Eventually, through a literature search she decided that she wanted to study interprofessional practice in health care. After having found this problem area McCallin did what is not recommended in <b>classic</b> <b>GT</b> – she began studying the scientific literature on interprofessional practice. However, the area was almost unexplored. In my opinion McCallin did not start her GT until she found the specific research area she wanted to explore. But this area was not found through a specific scientific literature search but by generally exploring {{what was going on in}} the health care scene in her part of the world. Then she could have been preconceived by too early reading the scientific literature, but the area was scientifically a virgin land to her luck...|$|R

Health care providers {{must take into}} consideration that culture impacts health care seeking behaviors. The theory of Caring with Honor is emerging through the <b>classic</b> <b>GT</b> method. A team of investigators within the VA health care system gathered data from 19 health care professionals via one-on-one interviews. The emerging theory, Caring with Honor, represents an amplifying process whereby health care professionals engage with Veterans {{through a process of}} enculturating, witnessing, connecting, honoring, and caring with purpose...|$|R

40|$|Barney Glaser (2013) No preconceptions – The {{grounded}} theory dictum. Mill Valley, CA: Sociology Press Given that the dictum of no preconception {{is not new}} in GT, why did Glaser focus his attention so much on it to write a whole book on this topic? The dictum has been declared over and over again, for example in the chapter on Generating Theory in the seminal work of Glaser and Strauss (1967) and the chapters on Reading the Literature and Forcing the Data in Glaser’s (1998) book entitled “Doing {{grounded theory}}. ” It might be reasonable, then, for a reader to ask why this book is needed and whether the dictum should not just be followed. The answer is that not allowing preconceptions to influence research {{is one of the}} greatest challenges and maybe even “the most difficult procedure of all” (Glaser, 2013, p. 133). Therefore, it is important to take it seriously; expanding on the issue is commendable and a welcomed contribution to the literature on <b>classic</b> <b>GT.</b> ...|$|R
