2500|$|The Laugaland field near Akureyri was {{the first}} {{geothermal}} source commercially developed. [...] The Ytri-Tjarnir field followed. To obtain sufficient water flow, additional fields were developed at Botn in 1980, Glerárdalur [...] SW of the town in 1981, and Þelamörk [...] north of the town in 1992. Water temperature is generally [...] but can drop to [...] during hot summer days. The cost of geothermal production is, at 32 mill/kwh, higher than the Icelandic national average of 11, but slightly less {{than the cost of}} imported heating oil. There is diminishing excess capacity but there are known and <b>untapped</b> <b>resources</b> near the town.

Sir Alec Bedser died in hospital in Woking on 4 April 2010 {{after a short}} illness. Among those {{to pay tribute to}} the more famous of the two brothers was former Prime Minister, well-known cricket lover and lifelong Surrey supporter John Major, who said: [...] "Alec Bedser {{was one of the greatest}} medium-fast bowlers of all time.

[...] For three months following the death of Arthur McIntyre on 26 December 2009, Bedser was the oldest surviving England Test cricketer.
