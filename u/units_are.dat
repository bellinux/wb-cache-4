5|$|The command {{structure}} is hierarchical, with divisions and brigades controlling groups of units. Major <b>units</b> <b>are</b> regiment- or battalion-sized, and minor <b>units</b> <b>are</b> company-sized units (or platoons).

5|$|Military <b>units</b> <b>are</b> {{produced}} at specific buildings {{relevant to their}} area. All sea <b>units</b> <b>are</b> created at the docks. Walls and towers are defensive fortifications (Age of Empires {{was one of the}} first real-time strategy games to include walls strong enough to form a feasible means of defense). Farms are used to produce food. Granaries, storage pits, and the Town Center are used to store resources deposited by the villagers.|$|E

5|$|The International System of Units (Système {{international}} d'unités or SI) is {{the current}} international standard metric system and is also the system most widely used around the world.

5|$|The SI base <b>units</b> <b>are</b> the {{building}} blocks of the system and all other <b>units</b> <b>are</b> derived from them. When Maxwell first introduced the concept of a coherent system, he identified three quantities that could be used as base units: mass, length and time. Giorgi later identified the need for an electrical base unit. Theoretically any one of electric current, potential difference, electrical resistance, electrical charge or a number of other quantities could have provided the base unit, with the remaining units then being defined by the laws of physics. In the event, the unit of electric current was chosen for SI. Another three base units (for temperature, substance and luminous intensity) were added later.|$|E

5|$|The terpenoids, {{sometimes}} referred to as isoprenoids, are organic chemicals similar to terpenes, derived from five-carbon isoprene units. There are over 10,000 known types of terpenoids. Most are multicyclic structures which differ from one another in both functional groups, and in basic carbon skeletons. Monoterpenoids, continuing 2 isoprene <b>units,</b> <b>are</b> volatile essential oils such as citronella, limonene, menthol, camphor, and pinene. Diterpenoids, 4 isoprene <b>units,</b> <b>are</b> widely distributed in latex and resins, and can be quite toxic. Diterpenes are responsible for making Rhododendron leaves poisonous. Plant steroids and sterols are also produced from terpenoid precursors, including vitamin D, glycosides (such as digitalis) and saponins (which lyse red blood cells of herbivores).|$|E
