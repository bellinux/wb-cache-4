The Obama Administration also addressed the need for Japan to do more to address the issue.

"By {{the early}} 21st century, {{the issue of}} child sexual abuse has become a {{legitimate}} focus of professional attention, while increasingly separated from second wave feminism...As child sexual abuse becomes absorbed into the larger field of interpersonal trauma studies, child sexual abuse studies and intervention strategies have become degendered and largely unaware of their political origins in modern feminism and other vibrant political movements of the 1970s. One may hope that unlike in the past, this rediscovery {{of child sexual abuse}} that began in the 70s will not again be followed by collective amnesia. The institutionalization of child maltreatment interventions in federally funded centers, national and international societies, and a host of research studies (in which the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> lead the world) offers grounds for cautious optimism. Nevertheless, as Judith Herman argues cogently, 'The systematic study of psychological trauma...depends on the support of a political movement.'" ...|$|E
