Typically polypropylene or EPDM rubber or silicone rubber is used as an absorber.

The technology has been extensively monitored by these government agencies, and Natural Resources Canada developed the feasibility tool RETScreen™ to model the energy savings from transpired solar collectors. Since that time, several thousand transpired solar collector systems have been installed in a variety of commercial, industrial, institutional, agricultural, and process applications in countries around the world. The technology was originally used primarily in industrial applications such as manufacturing and assembly plants where there were high ventilation requirements, stratified ceiling heat, and often negative pressure in the building. With the increasing drive to install renewable energy systems on buildings, transpired solar collectors are now used across the entire building stock because of high energy production (up to 750 peak thermal Watts/square metre), high solar conversion (up to 90%) and lower capital costs when compared against solar photovoltaic and solar water heating.|$|E

5000|$|The main {{use of this}} {{technology}} is in residential buildings where the demand for hot water has a large impact on energy bills. This generally means a situation with a large family, or {{a situation in which}} the hot water demand is excessive due to frequent laundry washing. Commercial applications include laundromats, car washes, military laundry facilities and eating establishments. The technology can also be used for space heating if the building is located off-grid or if utility power is subject to frequent outages. Solar water heating systems are most likely to be cost effective for facilities with water heating systems that are expensive to operate, or with operations such as laundries or kitchens that require large quantities of hot water. <b>Unglazed</b> liquid <b>collectors</b> are commonly used to heat water for swimming pools but can also be applied to large scale water pre-heating. When loads are large relative to available collector area the bulk of the water heating can be done at low temperature, lower than at swimming pool temperatures where <b>unglazed</b> <b>collectors</b> are well established in the marketplace as the right choice. Because these collectors need not withstand high temperatures, they can use less expensive materials such as plastic or rubber. Many <b>unglazed</b> <b>collectors</b> are made of polypropylene and must be drained fully to avoid freeze damage when air temperatures drop below 44F on clear nights. A smaller but growing percentage of <b>unglazed</b> <b>collectors</b> are flexible meaning they can withstand water freezing solid inside their absorber. The freeze concern only need be the water filled piping and collector manifolds in a hard freeze condition. Unglazed solar hot water systems should be installed to [...] "drainback" [...] to a storage tank whenever solar radiation is insufficient. There are no thermal shock concerns with unglazed systems. Commonly used in swimming pool heating since solar energy's early beginnings, <b>unglazed</b> solar <b>collectors</b> heat swimming pool water directly without the need for antifreeze or heat exchangers. Hot water solar systems require heat exchangers due to contamination possibilities and in the case of <b>unglazed</b> <b>collectors,</b> the pressure difference between the solar working fluid (water) and the load (pressurized cold city water). Large scale unglazed solar hot water heaters like the one at the Minoru Aquatic Center in Richmond BC [...] operate at lower temperatures than evacuated tube or boxed and glazed collector systems so they require larger more expensive heat exchangers but all other components including vented storage tanks and uninsulated plastic PVC piping reduce costs of this alternative dramatically compared to the higher temperature collector types.

50|$|For a given {{absorber}} area, evacuated tubes {{can therefore}} maintain their efficiency {{over a wide}} range of ambient temperatures and heating requirements. In most climates, flat-plate collectors will generally be more cost-effective than evacuated tubes. When employed in arrays and considered instead on a per square metre basis, the efficient but costly evacuated tube collectors can have a net benefit in winter and summer. They are well-suited to cold ambient temperatures and work well in situations of consistently low sunshine, providing heat more consistently than flat plate collectors per square metre. Heating of water by a medium to low amount (i.e. Tm-Ta) is much more efficiently performed by flat plate collectors. Domestic hot water frequently falls into this medium category.

40|$|Solar energy can be {{utilized}} to heat {{water with the}} use of flat plate collectors. Effort is made to reduce the cost of solar water heating technology {{in order to make it}} economically competitive to conventional energy. An absorber material is tested on component level and performance related aspects are studied. The material has a lower price than the polymer materials currently used in glazed collectors, and therefore it has the potential to lower the cost of solar flat plate collectors. The performance related aspects are tested on a partially glazed, natural circulating flat plate collector, referred to as the Duo-Collector. The aim of letting the collector be partially glazed is to prevent the heat carrier from boiling. Samples cut from an extruded absorber sheet were exposed to 140 degrees Celsius and 150 degrees Celsius for different periods of time. These were used to map the mechanical properties of the material. The samples exposed to 150 degrees Celsius were used to map dimensional and optical changes. The results from the material-related studies on component level show that no failure occurs for any of the ageing periods which were realized in the time frame of the present work. The extruded absorber sheet has a sufficiently high absorptance and dimensional stability. These findings have strengthened the material's position as a candidate for use in solar thermal applications. The performance of the Duo-Collector has been simulated with MATLAB. It is found that the system is suitable as a method for preventing the fluid in the collector from boiling. The efficiency of such a system was also investigated. For low operating temperatures the efficiency of a Duo-Collector is approximately equal to the efficiency of a fully glazed or an <b>unglazed</b> <b>collector.</b> The efficiency of all the collectors decrease with increasing operating temperatures, and the efficiency of the Duo-Collector is between that of a fully glazed and that of an <b>unglazed</b> <b>collector</b> for all operating temperatures above approximately 10 degrees Celsius.

The goal {{of this paper is}} to obtain the (pair of) efficiency curves of a hybrid PV/T collector with a sheet-and-tube design and to evaluate the effect of a non-uniform temperature distribution on the surface of the solar cell on its electrical power output. A 3 -dimensional numerical model is developed to estimate the performance of such a collector. The model allows various design parameters of the PV/T to be varied so that the influence of each of these parameters can be studied on the overall system performance both at steady-state and at varying atmospheric conditions. The main parameters considered are the number of glass covers, ranging from an <b>unglazed</b> <b>collector</b> configuration to a double-glazed collector configuration, and the width-to-pipe diameter (W/D) ratio. The results show that, while the thermal efficiency increases with the additional glazing, the electrical efficiency deteriorates due to the higher temperature of the fluid and due to increased optical losses, as expected. The dynamic performance of the PV/T collector and system are also investigated. Results from the dynamic model and also from a simplified quasi-steady state model are reported. The results show that in the case of highly fluctuating incident radiation, e. g. from clouds, the quasi-steady solution can deviate by up to 20 % from the dynamic solution in the evaluation of the thermal energy output in the case of low incident radiation with large fluctuations. am 201...|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} a novel {{building}} integrated photovoltaic/thermal (BIPVT) solar collector was developed, tested, modelled and optimised both experimentally and theoretically. Experimental testing found that glazing the prototype collector improved the maximum thermal efficiency by approximately 25 % and decreased heat loss, {{by a factor}} of two, relative to an <b>unglazed</b> <b>collector.</b> Additionally, the spectral absorptance of a photovoltaic (PV) cell and several coloured absorber samples were characterised. The experimental data was subsequently used in the development and validation of an optimisation model for BIPVT style collectors. Numerical optimisation showed that the collector thermal efficiency could be improved by maximising the geometric fin efficiency, reducing the thermal resistance between the PV cells and the absorber, and by increasing the transmittance-absorptance product of the PV cells and/or the absorber. The results showed that low cost materials, such as mild steel, could be used without significantly affecting the BIPVTs thermal efficiency. It was also shown that there was potential to develop coloured BIPVT collectors with acceptable thermal efficiencies. Finally, the model showed that potentially the air space in an attic could be used rather than traditional insulating materials. Subsequent computational and experimental fluid dynamics studies found that the heat transfer coefficients in a scale-model attic would result in R-values similar to mineral wool type insulation and therefore may provide sufficient insulation of a BIPVT in a cold roof building. In these studies the validity of an existing correlation for natural convection in an attic-shaped enclosure was extended to Grashof numbers in the range 10 ^ 7 to 10 ^ 9 from its previous range, 2. 9 x 10 ^ 6 to 9 x 10 ^ 6. The use of a single vertically mounted baffle was also found to reduce the natural convection heat transfer coefficients in attic-shaped enclosures.

The investigated system revealed a temperature increase of 3 K which equals 9 % lower electricity consumption. The yearly additional PV yield was determined to 4 % by reference measurement of uncooled conventional PV panels. Additionally, system simulations in TRNSYS are presented...|$|R
50|$|Higher {{temperatures}} are also possible with transpired collectors {{which can be}} configured to heat the air twice to increase the temperature rise making it suitable for space heating of larger buildings. In a 2-stage system, the first stage is the typical <b>unglazed</b> transpired <b>collector</b> and the second stage has glazing covering the transpired collector. The glazing allows all of that heated air from the first stage to be directed through {{a second set of}} transpired collectors for a second stage of solar heating.|$|R
