25|$|Tijuana {{is located}} at , just south of San Diego. The city is divided into nine {{administrative}} boroughs, which are in turn divided into neighborhoods. These boroughs offer administrative services such as urban planning, civil registry, inspection, verification, public works and community development, served by a delegate. As Tijuana ranks higher in the Mexican <b>urban</b> <b>hierarchy</b> than San Diego does in the American <b>urban</b> <b>hierarchy,</b> Tijuana contains many foreign consulates including those of China, Korea, Finland, the United States, Germany, Spain, Honduras, France, Austria, Gambia, the United Kingdom, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Israel, Canada, and the Czech Republic. Tijuana does not receive competition from a larger urban center as San Diego does from Los Angeles. However, with Mexicali growing rapidly, a possible canal project planned and Silicon Border development under way, Tijuana will soon face similar competition.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{documents}} {{the evolution of}} rank orders for cities {{at the top of}} national <b>urban</b> <b>hierarchies</b> (top 10 cities, where possible). Ranks for the year 2000 are compared with 1950 for 74 nations and with 1900 for 52 nations, covering 375 and 288 cities respectively. Rank correlations with the year 2000 are calculated for both years. The rank order of cities in Europe shows significantly less variation over time than those for the New World and developing nations, consistent with the view that <b>urban</b> <b>hierarchies</b> harden as they mature. Changes in rank at the very top (rank 1) are rare. Where they occur, such changes can often be traced to political events that alter the direction of trade or the city's role as central place. The results provide evidence both for and against locational fundamentals and cumulative causation arguments. The entrenched advantages of the first big cities to emerge are undeniable; but 'fundamentals' can be undermined by political events and by technological change. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{municipality}} {{is limited}} to the north with Campos Gerais and Santana da Vargem, on south with the municipality of Varginha, Elói Mendes and Paraguaçu,on east with Nepomuceno e Carmo da Cachoeira and west with Campos Gerais. It's located at about 290 kilometers away from Belo Horizonte, the state's capital. According to the map of <b>urban</b> <b>hierarchy</b> produced by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, Três Pontas is classified as a B zone center, that means the city has a restricted influence, only over the smaller cities around it. The city is under influence of Varginha that, on the other hand, is under influence of Belo Horizonte.|$|E
25|$|The {{choice of}} stadium {{locations}} was drafted from an original list of 14 cities. FIFA and CFO monitored the progress {{and quality of}} preparations, culminating in the former providing final checks of the grounds weeks before the tournament commenced. Montpellier was the surprise inclusion from the final list of cities because of its low <b>urban</b> <b>hierarchy</b> in comparison to Strasbourg, who boasted a better hierarchy and success from its local football team, having {{been taken over by}} a consortium. Montpellier however was considered ambitious by the selecting panel to host World Cup matches. The local city and regional authories in particular had invested heavily into football the previous two decades and were able to measure economic effects, in terms of jobs as early as in 1997. Some of the venues used for this tournament were also used for the previous World Cup in France in 1938. The Stade Vélodrome in Marseille, the Stade Municipal in Toulouse, the Gerland in Lyon, the Parc Lescure in Bordeaux and the Parc des Princes in Paris received the honor of hosting World Cup matches once again in 1998 as they had all done in 1938.|$|E

40|$|Modern urban landscapes are {{characterized}} by the progressive separation of the location of jobs, houses and amenities, which inexorably leads to the increase of urban travel and transit. This is the beginning point for some recent research programs in regional economics (Krugman, 1991; Glaeser, 1992; Henderson, 1997; Gabaix, 1999; Dobkins et Ioannides, 2000) which adopt {{a new line of}} reasoning based on the study of the commuting trips that characterise contemporary urban life. Different aspects of these trips, such as the volume, the pathways and the travel modes of the commuters, are examined with regard to mass transport, local public services and the increasing diversification of rural and urban amenities. This allows one to explore some original aspects of the recent transformations in both modern cities organisation and regional <b>urban</b> <b>hierarchies</b> and, by the way, identify institutional and policy responses to new urban problems such as traffic congestion or residential segregation (Brueckner, Thisse and Zenou, 2002; Mauer and Ott, 1999). However, instead of trying to define a general households' residential model, it seems then more appropriate to investigate the relationship between a given urban organisation and its regional macro-economic environment (Gabaix, 1999; Axtell and Florida, 2000). This point of view defend the hypothesis of a principle of structural dependence involving the action of long-term macroeconomic effects on the puzzling geometry of an urban economy (Marsili and Zhang, 1998; Simpson, 2000). By studying the case of La Reunion, this paper aims to study how insularity affects the locational choices of firms and households and their impact on regional <b>urban</b> <b>hierarchies...</b>|$|R

Similarly, governments, transport ministries and supply chain actors should strengthen discussions about the negative externalities of traffic concentration in an ever smaller number of port gateways.|$|R

40|$|Summary. The {{progress}} {{of political and}} economic integration among European countries is inducing the progressive emergence of a European urban system. National urban systems are restructuring and adapting themselves to this new international and economic context. The location of the largest multinational firms is taken as revealing a major step in the process of the integration of European cities into supra-national networks. A survey of the location of 3000 establishments belonging to the 300 largest European firms provides interesting results about the factors making European cities attractive for such activities. It may be inferred from these results that they confirm a new trend called `metropolisation', which is reinforcing the top of the national <b>urban</b> <b>hierarchies,</b> as demonstrated in other studies...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} general new {{economic}} geography model with multiple industries and regions, full labor and capital mobility, land use in production and consumption, and a dynamic adjustment process in which consumers maximize utility and firms respond to nonzero profits. All industries use intermediate inputs as well as land, labor, and capital. Systems of cities form endogenously within this framework, including asymmetrical <b>urban</b> <b>hierarchies</b> and cities of different sizes and industry compositions. Each urban area has a bid-rent gradient and zones with land uses and densities as in the von Thünen model. The equilibrium depends not only on initial conditions but also on speeds of adjustment. The model is a prototype for empirical implementation, as illustrated with a simulation {{of the effects of}} transportation cost reductions. Copyright 2000 Blackwell Publishers...|$|R
5000|$|Rosser {{suggested}} {{applications in}} political economy {{such as the}} emergence of the European Union out of the conscious actions of the leaders of its constituent nation states (1992), or the appearance of a higher level in an <b>urban</b> <b>hierarchy</b> during economic development (1994). It has been applied to the emergence of higher levels in an ecological hierarchy (Rosser, Folke, Günther, Isomäki, Perrings, and Puu, 1994), and {{it can be argued that}} the final stage of such a development for combined ecologic-economic systems would be the noosphere of Vladimir I.

50|$|While {{the pattern}} of <b>urban</b> <b>hierarchy</b> tends {{to conform to the}} power law, it is not universal. Especially at the country level, we observe {{significant}} deviations from the theoretical distribution. Countries with a primate city, a city that dominates in population size and, usually, economically, have a deficit of intermediate size cities. Examples of primate cities include Paris in France, London in the United Kingdom, and Tokyo in Japan. The history of these countries play a large role in the persistence of their primate city. Particularly, the concentration of political power in one city early on has a large degree of path dependency.|$|E
5000|$|The {{imperial}} era {{of urban}} planning {{was marked by}} an attempt to extend imperial authority uniformly across China by creating an economic and political <b>urban</b> <b>hierarchy.</b> In the Han, this integration was imagined as the resurrection of an idealized memory of {{the golden age of}} the Zhou dynasty. Each province was divided into prefectures and each prefecture into counties. The network of imperial administrative cities was overlaid on an existing network of unwalled villages and townships. One county therefore ruled over several townships and many more villages. At the apex of this administrative hierarchy was a new creation, the imperial capital.|$|E

40|$|Universities' {{contributions}} to urban development frequently {{focus on their}} micro- or macro-scale effects, ignoring the meso-scale effects they have on inter-territorial relationships. Although universities are seen as {{an essential part of}} the recipe for successful urban development, there is a lacuna to understanding how they make places and shape <b>urban</b> <b>hierarchies,</b> and this article addresses this question. This article focuses on one university-urban development process, the creation and embedding of highly skilled graduates, to explore what the aggregate effects of universities on places are; it develops a set of indicators to measure graduate attraction and retention as well as the overall composite place effect. The article develops a typology based on these three indicator sets, and tests this using a data set developed from a Polish social media website. It finds that these indicators are a good way of measuring the effects of human capital creation and mobility at the urban scale. The article concludes by arguing that a greater focus is required in studying the roles that universities play in fostering through-flow in places, changing these places' nature as nodes within wider <b>urban</b> systems and <b>hierarchies,</b> in the context of university-regional development...|$|R
