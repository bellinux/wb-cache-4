The original MacPaint was programmed as a single-document interface. The palette positions and sizes were <b>unalterable,</b> as was the document window.

5|$|Thus Mu'tazilism became closely {{identified}} with the new regime of al-Mu'tasim, and adherence to Mu'tazilism was transformed into an intensely political issue, since to question it was to oppose {{the authority of the}} Caliph as the God-sanctioned imām. While Mu'tazilism found broad support, it was also passionately opposed by traditionalists, who held that the Quran's authority was absolute and <b>unalterable</b> as the literal word of God, as well as providing a vehicle for criticism by those who disliked the new regime and its elites. In the event, the active repression of the traditionalists was without success, and even proved counterproductive: the beating and imprisonment {{of one of the most}} resolute opponents of Mu'tazilism, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, in 834, only helped to spread his fame. By the time al-Mutawakkil abandoned Mu'tazilism and returned to traditional orthodoxy in 848, the strict and conservative Hanbali school had emerged as the leading school of jurisprudence (fiqh) in Sunni Islam.|$|E

With agreement among the Fathers, though, the authority of interpretation grows, and full patristic consensus is very strong. With canon law (which tends to be highly rigorous and very strict, especially with clergy) an <b>unalterable</b> validity also does not apply, since canons deal with living on earth, where conditions are always changing and each case is subject to almost infinite variation from the next. Even when and where they were once used with full strictness, their application was not absolute, and was carried out for individuals under the pastoral care of their bishop, who {{had the authority to}} decide when individual discipline had been satisfied.

25|$|Nimzowitsch's chess theories, {{when first}} propounded, flew {{in the face}} of widely held orthodoxies enunciated by the {{dominant}} theorist of the era, Siegbert Tarrasch, and his disciples. Tarrasch's rigid generalizations drew on the earlier work of Wilhelm Steinitz, and were upheld by Tarrasch's sharp tongue when dismissing the opinions of doubters. While the greatest players of the time, among them Alekhine, Emanuel Lasker and Capablanca, clearly did not allow their play to be hobbled by blind adherence to general concepts that the center had to be controlled by pawns, that development had to happen in support of this control, that rooks always belong on open files, that wing openings were unsound—core ideas of Tarrasch's chess philosophy as popularly understood—beginners were taught to think of these generalizations as <b>unalterable</b> principles.|$|E
25|$|According to Jains, the {{universe}} has a firm and an <b>unalterable</b> shape which is measured in the Jain texts {{by means of a}} unit called Rajju which is supposed to be very large. The Digambara sect of Jainism postulates that {{the universe}} is fourteen Rajju high and extends seven Rajjus from north to south. Its breadth is seven Rajjus at the bottom and decreases gradually till the middle where it is one Rajju. The width then increases gradually till it is five Rajju and again decreases till it is one Rajju. The apex of the universe is one Rajju long, one Rajju wide and eight Rajju high. The total space of the world is thus 343 cubic Rajju. The svetambara view differs slightly and postulates that there is constant increase and decrease in the breadth and the space is 239 cubic Rajju.|$|E
25|$|Portugal {{was brought}} low {{during the final}} years of the reign of Philip III, as the Spanish {{officials}} often flagrantly violated the conditions granted by Philip I, which were the original contract and <b>unalterable</b> constitution of Portugal while it was subject to the monarchs of Castile. Lisbon, the once great cosmopolitan city, was reduced to the rank of a provincial city with no influence among the higher Spanish nobility who governed from Madrid, their conservative and fundamentalist Catholic capital. Lisbon lost much of its population and its importance to the world economy as its mercantile activity shrank. With economic decline, unemployment and crime increased greatly, adding to the misery of the common people. The Spanish authorities were obliged to introduce a kind of auxiliary police force, the Quadrilheiros, whose members patrolled the streets to control street crime, fights, sorcery and gaming.|$|E
25|$|The amendment's proponents {{argued that}} the fixing of a time limit and the {{extending}} of it were powers committed exclusively to Congress under the political question doctrine and that in any event Congress had power to extend. It was argued that inasmuch as the fixing of a reasonable time was within Congress' power and that Congress could fix the time either in advance or at some later point, based upon its evaluation {{of the social and}} other bases of the necessities of the amendment, Congress did not do violence to the Constitution when, once having fixed the time, it subsequently extended the time. Proponents recognized that if the time limit was fixed in the text of the amendment Congress could not alter it because the time limit as well as the substantive provisions of the proposal had been subject to ratification by a number of States, making it <b>unalterable</b> by Congress except through the amending process again. Opponents argued that Congress, having by a two-thirds vote sent the amendment and its authorizing resolution to the states, had put the matter beyond changing by passage of a simple resolution, that states had either acted upon the entire package or at least that they had or could have acted affirmatively upon the promise of Congress that if the amendment had not been ratified within the prescribed period it would expire and their assent would not be compelled for longer than they had intended.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} Benjamin {{returned}} to the East Coast, the Republican candidate, Lincoln, had been elected president, and there was talk, in Louisiana and elsewhere, of secession from the Union. The New Orleans Picayune reported that Benjamin favored secession {{only in the last}} resort. [...] On December 23, 1860, another Louisiana periodical, the Delta, printed a letter from Benjamin dated the eighth stating that, as the people of the North were of <b>unalterable</b> hostility to their Southern brethren, the latter should depart from the government common to them. He also signed a joint letter from Southern congressmen to their constituents, urging the formation of a confederation of the seceding states. According to a letter reportedly written by Benjamin during the crisis, he saw secession as a means of obtaining more favorable terms in a reformed Union.|$|E

The president of the Council owed his position to both his party and to the Emperor and these could sometimes come into conflict. 19th-century abolitionist leader and historian Joaquim Nabuco said that the [...] "President of the Council in Brazil was no Russian Chancellor, Sovereign's creature, nor a British Prime Minister, made only by {{the trust of the}} [...] Commons: the delegation of the Crown was to him as necessary and important as the delegation of the Chamber, and, to exert with safety his functions, he had to dominate the caprice, the oscillations and ambitions of the Parliament, as well as to preserve always <b>unalterable</b> the favor, the good will of the emperor." ...|$|E
500|$|Hall wrote The Well of Loneliness {{in part to}} popularise {{the ideas}} of sexologists such as Richard von Krafft-Ebing and Havelock Ellis, who {{regarded}} homosexuality as an inborn and <b>unalterable</b> trait: congenital sexual inversion. In Krafft-Ebing's Psychopathia Sexualis (1886), the first book Stephen finds in her father's study, inversion {{is described as a}} degenerative disorder common in families with histories of mental illness. Exposure to these ideas leads Stephen to describe herself and other inverts as [...] "hideously maimed and ugly". Later texts such as Sexual Inversion (1896) by Havelock Ellis– who contributed a foreword to The Well– described inversion simply as a difference, not as a defect. By 1901 Krafft-Ebing had adopted a similar view. Hall championed their ideas over those of the psychoanalysts, who saw homosexuality as a form of arrested psychological development, and some of whom believed it could be changed.|$|E
500|$|Counsel for the Government held a {{different}} view. It was {{noted that the}} Peerage Act 1963 explicitly repealed the portions of the Articles of Union relating to elections of representative peers, and that no parliamentary commentators had raised doubts as to the validity of those repeals. As Article XXII had been, or at least purportedly, repealed, there was nothing specific in the Treaty that the bill transgressed. It was further asserted by the Government that Article XXII could be repealed because {{it had not been}} entrenched. Examples of entrenched provisions are numerous: England and Scotland were united [...] "forever", the Court of Session was to remain [...] "in all time coming within Scotland as it is now constituted", and the establishment of the Church of Scotland was [...] "effectually and unalterably secured". Article XXII, however, did not include any words of entrenchment, making it [...] "fundamental or <b>unalterable</b> in all time coming".|$|E
500|$|Evolutionary thought, the {{conception}} that species change over time, has roots in antiquity - in {{the ideas of}} the ancient Greeks, Romans, and Chinese as well as in medieval Islamic science. With the beginnings of modern biological taxonomy in the late 17th century, two opposed ideas influenced Western biological thinking: [...] essentialism, the belief that every species has essential characteristics that are <b>unalterable,</b> a concept which had developed from medieval Aristotelian metaphysics, and that fit well with natural theology; and [...] the development of the new anti-Aristotelian approach to modern science: as the Enlightenment progressed, evolutionary cosmology and the mechanical philosophy spread from the physical sciences to natural history. Naturalists began to focus on the variability of species; the emergence of paleontology with the concept of extinction further undermined static views of nature. In the early 19th century Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744 – 1829) proposed his theory of the transmutation of species, the first fully formed theory of evolution.|$|E
500|$|The {{first two}} {{decisions}} to interpret § 8 construed {{it not to}} apply to the crimes charged. In United States v. Bevans (1818), the Court held that the § 8 of the Act did not extend to a murder committed on a navy vessel within state waters. In United States v. Palmer (1818), the Court held that the § 8 of the Act did not extend to piracy by U.S. citizen defendants, in the employ of a South American government at war with Spain, committed against Spanish ships and citizens. President John Quincy Adams was a harsh critic of the decision in Palmer. He wrote in his diary that the Court had [...] "cast away the jurisdiction which a law of congress had given, that its [...] "reasoning [...] a sample of judicial logic—disingenuous, false, and hollow," [...] and that it gave him [...] "an early disgust for the practice of law, and led me to the <b>unalterable</b> determination never to accept judicial office." ...|$|E
500|$|By late 1944, {{both the}} Red Army and the Western Allies were {{advancing}} into Germany. Recognising {{the strength and}} determination of the Red Army, Hitler decided to use his remaining mobile reserves against the American and British troops, which he perceived as far weaker. On 16 December, he launched the Ardennes Offensive to incite disunity among the Western Allies and perhaps convince them to join his fight against the Soviets. The offensive failed after some temporary successes. With much of Germany in ruins in January 1945, Hitler spoke on the radio: [...] "However grave as the crisis may be at this moment, it will, despite everything, be mastered by our <b>unalterable</b> will." [...] Hitler's hope to negotiate peace with the United States and Britain was encouraged {{by the death of}} Franklin D. Roosevelt on 12 April 1945, but contrary to his expectations, this caused no rift among the Allies. Acting on his view that Germany's military failures meant it had forfeited its right to survive as a nation, Hitler ordered the destruction of all German industrial infrastructure before it could fall into Allied hands. Minister for Armaments Albert Speer was entrusted with executing this scorched earth policy, but he secretly disobeyed the order.|$|E
500|$|Russia's Empress Catherine and Prussia's King FrederickII {{provoked}} {{a conflict between}} members of the Sejm and the King over civil rights for religious minorities, such as Protestants and Greek Orthodox whose positions, which were guaranteed equal with the Catholic majority by the Warsaw Confederation of 1573, had worsened considerably. Catherine and Frederick declared {{their support for the}} szlachta and their [...] "liberties", and by October 1767 Russian troops had assembled outside Warsaw in support of the conservative Radom Confederation. The King and his adherents {{had little choice but to}} acquiesce to Russian demands. During the Repnin Sejm (named after the unofficially presiding Russian ambassador Nicholas Repnin) the King accepted the five [...] "eternal and invariable principles" [...] which Catherine had vowed to [...] "protect for all time to come in the name of Poland's liberties": the election of kings, the right of liberum veto, the right to renounce allegiance to and raise rebellion against the king (rokosz), the szlachta exclusive right to hold office and land, and landowners' power over their peasants. Thus all the privileges ("Golden Freedoms") of the nobility that had made the Commonwealth ungovernable were guaranteed as <b>unalterable</b> in the Cardinal Laws. The Cardinal Laws and the rights of [...] "religious dissenters" [...] passed by the Repnin Sejm were personally guaranteed by Empress Catherine.

2500|$|Empedocles, {{like the}} Ionian {{philosophers}} and the atomists, continued {{the tradition of}} tragic thought which tried to find {{the basis of the}} relationship of the one and many.

Yet, each one had his peculiar way of describing this relation of Divine and mortal thought and thus of the relation of the One and the Many. In order to account for change in the world, in accordance with the ontological requirements of the Eleatics, they viewed changes as the result of mixture and separation of <b>unalterable</b> fundamental realities.

Henry Wilson's History of The Rise and Fall of the Slave Power in America (1872–1877) is the foremost representative of this moral interpretation, which argued that Northerners had fought to preserve the union against the aggressive designs of [...] "slave power". Later, in his seven-volume History of the United States from the Compromise of 1850 to the Civil War, (1893–1900), James Ford Rhodes identified slavery as the central—and virtually only—cause of the Civil War.
