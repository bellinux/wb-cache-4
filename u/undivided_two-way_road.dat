40|$|AbstractTwo {{or three}} lane <b>two-way</b> <b>undivided</b> <b>roads</b> are a {{ubiquitous}} presence in any city in India {{and they are}} typically mixed traffic roads with vehicles of widely varying static and dynamic characteristics and with poor or no lane discipline. Hence multi-class speed flow equations are more relevant to these types of facilities rather than single class flow speed models. In addition, the available research for the operation {{of these types of}} facilities in India is very limited. Hence this paper aims to study the traffic flow in a three-lane <b>two-way</b> <b>undivided</b> <b>road</b> in the city of Chennai through developing multi-class speed-flow relationships using both linear and Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) models. It has been found from the study that models with total volume perform the same irrespective of units used being vehicles or PCU and models with class-wise (with and without direction) consistently perform better than total volume models. It was also found that linear models work better than other models for all vehicle classes modelling 2 -wheeler speeds and two-wheelers, cars and LCVs have the greatest influence on the speeds of almost all the category of vehicles and the stream. One of the other important conclusions from the study is that an optimum use of class-wise and class& direction-wise models can offer models of better fit than two individual class and class-direction models...|$|R

40|$|Driver {{behaviour}} {{and high}} speed are constantly advised {{as the greatest}} causes of road accidents, as annually referred from ACI-ISTAT statistics (Automobile Club of Italy and National Institute of Statistics). Therefore {{it is necessary to}} deepen our knowledge on these two accident factors in order to formulate objectively quantitative evaluations on road safety. It’ll be possible to realize rigid measures to obtain a reduction in the accident rate without penalizing more transport acts. These quantitative evaluations will affect road design in the future. Accidents caused from skidding between wheels and pavement are very frequent with low traffic flow: possible consequences are bumps against other vehicles or obstacles to the margins of the road (e. g. crash barrier, retaining or gallery walls) and run off road. Accidents due to hazardous maneuvers (overtaking), and accidents on crossing start when traffic flow increases (medium flow). In high flow conditions accidents caused by sudden vehicles deceleration (stop and go) or by poor visibility conditions. Therefore it’s reasonable to give some responsibility to road environment (e. g. road layout, road width, visibility distances, pavement state, road sign). Accident survey has been developed collecting ACI-ISTAT statistics integrated with ANAS (Italian Roads Organization) traffic data. It must be pointed out that certain roads sections have a higher accident rate. It is possible to define true speed for a single vehicle reasonably for an <b>undivided</b> and <b>two-way</b> country <b>road</b> with low traffic conditions and control of geometric road characteristics. By the knowledge of speed and a direct study on accident reports compiled by Traffic Police, it has been possible to explain high accident rate due to road geometry...|$|R
30|$|The {{probability}} of a crash is reduced when driving on intersections or junctions. The coefficient of <b>two-way</b> <b>roads</b> variable has a positive sign, showing that the {{probability of}} a crash increases in these areas. It should be noticed that generally, this type of crash occurs on <b>two-way</b> <b>roads,</b> so the presence of this variable in the model is interesting. Further processing of modeling data clarifies that sometimes drivers who are under the influence of alcohols or drugs, drive in opposite direction on a one-way road. In these situations, the mentioned variable shows the significant effects of <b>two-way</b> <b>roads</b> on head-on crashes rather than one-way roads.|$|R

In order to make {{full advantage of the}} existing lanes, the <b>two-way</b> <b>road</b> lane has to be reallocated to play the best role in managing congestion. On the other hand, an effective tradable credit scheme can help to reduce the traffic demand and improve fairness for all travelers. So as to alleviate the commute congestion in urban transportation network, a discrete bilevel programming model is established in this paper. In the bilevel model, the government at the upper level reallocates lanes on the <b>two-way</b> <b>road</b> to minimize the total system cost. The traveler at the lower level chooses the optimal route on the basis of both travel time and credit charging for the lanes involved. A numerical experiment is conducted to examine the efficiency of the proposed method...|$|R

40|$|International audienceCooperative {{maneuver}} among autonomous {{and conventional}} vehicles {{can be considered}} one of the next steps for obtaining a safer and more comfortable driving. Some examples of these maneuvers are: Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), intelligent intersection management or automatic overtaking maneuvering, among others. One of the most important aims of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) is to use roads without substantial modifications of the current infrastructure. The overtaking maneuver demands special attentions, in particular when it is carried out on <b>two-way</b> <b>roads.</b> For this reason, a fuzzy decision system based on fuzzy logic able to execute an autonomous overtaking in <b>two-way</b> <b>roads</b> has been implemented in this paper. The experiments are focused on the longitudinal control when an autonomous vehicle is overtaking to other. Moreover, different cases have been considered using an oncoming vehicle from the other direction on a <b>two-way</b> <b>road.</b> Several trials with three real vehicles communicated via a wireless network were carried out, showing a good behavior...|$|R
