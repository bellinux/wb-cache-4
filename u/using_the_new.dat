5|$|Another $500,000 {{study was}} ordered in 2003 by the legislature, {{creating}} a new commerce corridor to link Lewis County {{in the south to}} the Canada–US border in the north. However the study showed that a highway existing north of I-90 was not economically feasible. The study proposed a toll road only for trucks, since the presence of passenger cars would discourage truck drivers from <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> alternate route. The highway was estimated to cost between $13.5 and $19 billion.|$|E
5|$|By 1962, {{both the}} United States and the Soviet Union had flown two solo spaceflights in the Space Race. There was a {{widespread}} perception, however, that the United States was falling behind; its two missions had been suborbital and had {{lasted only a}} few minutes. The Soviet missions had both orbited the Earth, and the second, Vostok 2, had remained in orbit for a full day. <b>Using</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> high-powered Atlas booster, the coming orbital Mercury missions were expected to reduce {{the gap between the}} two countries.|$|E

In 1936 Hubble produced a classification of galactic morphology that is used to this day.|$|E

5|$|On 10 May 1940, German forces invaded neutral Belgium {{without a}} formal {{declaration}} of war.

He refused to address the Belgian parliament beforehand, as Albert I had famously done at the outbreak of World War I. The speed of the German advance, <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> Blitzkrieg approach, soon pushed the Belgian army westwards despite British and French support.

5|$|The County Divisions, {{including}} the Norfolk County Division, were around 10,000 men strong and assigned {{to defend the}} coast of threatened sections of the country, undertaking defensive tasks {{including the}} manning of coastal artillery. These divisions were largely static, lacking mobility and also divisional assets such as artillery, engineers and reconnaissance forces. <b>Using</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> formations in this manner allowed the pre-war regular infantry divisions to undertake training and form an all-important reserve {{that could be used}} to counter-attack any possible German landing.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{economic}} realities of the conversion to sound, were the artistic considerations. Early sound films were often noted for being too verbose. In 1930, Carl Laemmle criticized the wall-to-wall banter of sound pictures, and director Ernst Lubitsch wondered what the camera was intended for if characters were going to narrate all the onscreen action. The film industry also withstood competition from the home radio, and often characters in films {{went to great lengths}} to belittle the medium. The film industry was not above <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> medium to broadcast commercials for its projects however, and occasionally turned radio stars into short feature performers to take advantage of their built-in following.|$|E
5|$|As the Henry Hudson Parkway {{replaced}} Riverside Drive in the mid-1930s, NY9A {{was moved}} onto it, eventually <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> parkway {{to where it}} crossed US9 (Broadway) in the Bronx. Here, NY9A exited the parkway and ran concurrent with US9 to the split in Yonkers. The Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel connecting Manhattan's Battery Park to Brooklyn was completed in 1950. By 1960, {{an extension of the}} West Side Elevated Highway south to the Manhattan tunnel portal became part of NY27A, which had ended in Brooklyn prior to the construction of the tunnel. On January1, 1970, NY27A was truncated on its western end to eastern Nassau County while NY27 was extended northward over NY27A's former routing through the Battery Tunnel and the West Side Elevated Highway.|$|E
5|$|Back at the Eppes house, Charlie and Don {{discuss what}} went wrong. Alan is {{confident}} that the math is correct. Don tells Charlie that if Charlie ran his model on Don, the model will not show Don at his apartment. Instead, it would zone in on his office, where {{he spends most of}} his time. Charlie then realizes that he needs to modify his model to identify two hot zones, one where the suspect possibly resides and one where he possibly works. <b>Using</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> equation and a list of potential suspects who work in the new hot zone, Don, Terry, and David confront the suspect and find his latest victim. After Don kills the suspect in a hostage situation, he calls Charlie down to the crime scene to tell Charlie that the suspect lived in the original hot zone but moved three weeks earlier. This revelation proves that Charlie's models are correct.|$|E

5|$|By 1862, navies across Europe {{had adopted}} ironclads. Britain and France each had sixteen either {{completed}} or under construction, though the British vessels were larger. Austria, Italy, Russia, and Spain were also building ironclads. However, the first battles <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> ironclad ships involved neither Britain nor France, and involved ships markedly {{different from the}} broadside-firing, masted designs of Gloire and Warrior. The use of ironclads by {{both sides in the}} American Civil War, and the clash of the Italian and Austrian fleets at the Battle of Lissa, had an important influence on the development of ironclad design.|$|E
5|$|Despite this, and at Godley's urging, {{a further}} attack was planned for 12 October, this time <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Zealand Division and the Australian 3rd Division. By now {{the ground was}} a sea of mud {{and a lack of}} {{preparation}} on the part of Godley's corps headquarters hampered the preliminary movements of the attacking divisions and supporting artillery. Godley's plans for the attack were overly ambitious and beyond the scale of previous operations that had been mounted earlier in the month in better weather and ground conditions and with more time to prepare. The operation on 12 October proved to be a failure with limited gains and heavy losses in the attacking divisions. After the battle, Godley downplayed the losses in the New Zealand Division (which amounted to around 2,900 casualties) and overstated the gains made in official correspondence to Allen, and a friend, Clive Wigram, who was the assistant private secretary to King George V.|$|E
5|$|In February 2009, Telltale Games {{renamed the}} game from its initial release title of Sam & Max: Season One to Sam & Max Save the World.

5|$|In the 1920s, {{off-peak}} {{there was}} a train every 4–5minutes from Wembley Park to Baker Street. There were generally two services per hour from both Watford and Uxbridge that ran non-stop from Wembley Park and stopping services started from Rayners Lane, Wembley Park, and Neasden, although most did not stop at Marlborough Road and St John's Wood Road. Off-peak, stations north of Moor Park were generally served by Marylebone trains. During the peak trains approached Baker Street every 2.5–3minutes, half running through to Moorgate, Liverpool Street or Aldgate. On the inner circle a train from Hammersmith ran through Baker Street every 6minutes, and Kensington (Addison Road) services terminated at Edgware Road. Maintaining a frequency of ten trains {{an hour on the}} circle was proving difficult and the solution chosen was for the District to extend its Putney to Kensington High Street service around the circle to Edgware Road, <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> platforms, and the Met to provide all the inner circle trains at a frequency of eight trains an hour.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the painted}} {{production}} of Verrocchio's workshop {{was done by}} his employees. According to Vasari, Leonardo collaborated with Verrocchio on his The Baptism of Christ, painting the young angel holding Jesus' robe {{in a manner that}} was so far superior to his master's that Verrocchio put down his brush and never painted again, although this is believed to be apocryphal. Close examination reveals areas that have been painted or touched-up over the tempera <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> technique of oil paint; the landscape, the rocks seen through the brown mountain stream and much of the figure of Jesus bearing witness to the hand of Leonardo. Leonardo may have been the model for two works by Verrocchio: the bronze statue of David in the Bargello and the Archangel Raphael in Tobias and the Angel.|$|E
5|$|The {{team from}} the University of Mainz were {{planning}} to study the electrodeposition of hassium atoms <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> TASCA facility at the GSI. Their aim was to use the reaction 226Ra(48Ca,4n)270Hs. In addition, scientists at the GSI were hoping to utilize TASCA to study the synthesis and properties of the hassium(II) compound hassocene, Hs(C5H5)2, using the reaction 226Ra(48Ca,xn). This compound {{is analogous to the}} lighter ferrocene, ruthenocene, and osmocene, and is expected to have the two cyclopentadienyl rings in an eclipsed conformation like ruthenocene and osmocene and not in a staggered conformation like ferrocene. Hassocene was chosen because it has hassium in the low formal oxidation state of +2 (although the bonding between the metal and the rings is mostly covalent in metallocenes) rather than the high +8 state which had previously been investigated, and relativistic effects were expected to be stronger in the lower oxidation state. Many metals in the periodic table form metallocenes, so that trends could be more easily determined, and the highly symmetric structure of hassocene and its low number of atoms also make relativistic calculations easier. Hassocene should be a stable and highly volatile compound.|$|E
