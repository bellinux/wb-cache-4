5|$|ZnO has wide direct {{band gap}} (3.37 eV or 375nm at room temperature). Therefore, its most common {{potential}} applications are in laser diodes and light emitting diodes (LEDs). Some optoelectronic applications of ZnO overlap with that of GaN, which has a similar bandgap (~3.4 eV at room temperature). Compared to GaN, ZnO has a larger exciton binding energy (~60 meV, 2.4 times of the room-temperature thermal energy), which results in bright room-temperature emission from ZnO. ZnO can be combined with GaN for LED-applications. For instance as transparent conducting oxide layer and ZnO nanostructures provide better light outcoupling. Other properties of ZnO favorable for electronic applications include its stability to high-energy radiation and its possibility to be patterned by wet chemical etching. Radiation resistance makes ZnO a suitable candidate for space applications. ZnO is the most promising candidate {{in the field of}} random lasers to produce an electronically pumped <b>UV</b> <b>laser</b> source.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The gain {{characteristics}} of AlGaN-delta-GaN quantum wells (QWs) with varying delta-GaN positions and AlGaN QW compositions are analyzed. The use of optimized AlGaN-delta-GaN QWs resulted in 7 -times increase in material gain over that of conve-ntional AlGaN QWs for gain media emitting at 240 nm. By employing asymmetric AlGaN-delta-GaN QWs, the optimized optical gain can be achievable for AlGaN-delta-GaN QW structure with realistic design applicable for mid- and deep-ultraviolet (<b>UV)</b> <b>lasers.</b> The threshold properties and differential gains are also studied for optimized AlGaN-delta-GaN QWs <b>UV</b> <b>lasers.</b> Index Terms: III-Nitride, AlGaN-delta-GaN quantum wells (QWs), deep <b>UV</b> (<b>UV)</b> <b>lasers,</b> optical gain, laser diodes. 1...|$|R

25|$|These output {{energies}} {{are still}} {{less than the}} 422MJ of input energy required to charge the system's capacitors that power the laser amplifiers. The net wall-plug efficiency of NIF (<b>UV</b> <b>laser</b> energy out divided by the energy required to pump the lasers from an external source) is less than one percent, and the total wall-to-fusion efficiency is under 10% at its maximum performance. An economical fusion reactor would require that the fusion output be at least {{an order of magnitude}} more than this input. Commercial laser fusion systems would use the much more efficient diode-pumped solid state lasers, where wall-plug efficiencies of 10 percent have been demonstrated, and efficiencies 16-18 percent are expected with advanced concepts under development.|$|E
25|$|Further {{upgrades}} to {{the simulation}} programs, accounting for these effects, predicted a new design that would reach ignition. This new system {{emerged as the}} 20-beam 200kJ Nova laser concept. During the initial construction phase, Nuckolls found an error in his calculations, and an October 1979 review chaired by John Foster Jr. of TRW confirmed {{that there was no}} way Nova would reach ignition. The Nova design was then modified into a smaller 10-beam design that added frequency conversion to 351nm light, which would increase coupling efficiency. In operation, Nova was able to deliver about 30kJ of <b>UV</b> <b>laser</b> energy, about half of what was initially expected, primarily due to limits set by optical damage to the final focusing optics. Even at those levels, it was clear that the predictions for fusion production were still wrong; even at the limited powers available, fusion yields were far below predictions.|$|E
