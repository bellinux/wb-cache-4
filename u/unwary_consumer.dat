50|$|Hidden fees {{can be a}} way for {{companies}} to trick the <b>unwary</b> <b>consumer</b> into paying excess fees (for example tax, shipping fees, insurance etc.) on a product that was advertised at a specific price {{as a way to}} increase profit without raising the price on the actual item.|$|E
5000|$|Thirdly, Satyam Infoway was {{required}} to prove that a likelihood of confusion {{in the minds of}} consumers would inevitably be a result due to the use of a similar domain name by Sifynet Solutions, and further, that such confusion would cause injury to the public and definite loss to Satyam Infoway. The standard applied by the court to assess likelihood of confusion was that of an <b>unwary</b> <b>consumer</b> of [...] "average intelligence and imperfect recollection". The court expressed the opinion that in the field of internet services, the difference in the nature of services offered by businesses may not be of much consequence due to the method of operation on the internet. The court discussed this facet at length and explained that the accessibility of domain names to a wide spectrum of users underscores the point that similarity in domain names would lead to confusion and also receipt of unsought for services.|$|E
40|$|With {{concern about}} {{secondary}} smoke, dust mites, formaldehyde emissions and bioaerosols, {{the public has}} {{become more aware of}} indoor air quality problems. Heating, air conditioning and ventilation units as well as associated ductwork can be the sources of mold, fungi and other microbial pollutants as well as particulates of dust, secondary smoke and pieces of dead dust mites. Along with the public’s concern has been the development of businesses directly associated with indoor air quality. Some of these businesses are reputable and supply effective indoor air quality services; others, on the other hand, offer little more than technical jargon and will take advantage of the <b>unwary</b> <b>consumer.</b> Duct cleaning has been an area that has been attracted by both reputable and unscrupulous businesses...|$|E
50|$|Weighted {{sterling}} or weighted silver {{refers to}} {{items such as}} cutlery, candlesticks, candy dishes, salt and pepper shakers, and trophies that instead of being made of solid silver, are in fact a cored composite of other materials. Wax, plaster, copper, or lead {{is used in the}} base to give the item strength, stability, and heft. Encapsulating items with a silver skin on the visible exterior greatly reduces cost. Manufacturers of such composite items are required by law to label them as “Weighted Sterling Silver” to ensure <b>unwary</b> <b>consumers</b> are not misled into believing the items are sterling silver.|$|R
40|$|The Recording Industry of America (RIAA) {{has made}} {{headlines}} 1 and garnered {{a fair amount}} of criticism in recent years, both for the first jury trial against an individual copyright infringer and for its litigation tactics. In the midst of the RIAA‘s aggressive litigation, issues related to proof have come to the forefront, particularly regarding the use of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to determine the identity of alleged copyright infringers. Additionally, the RIAA and other organizations have sought to hold individuals owning unsecured wireless routers liable for any illegal file-sharing that takes place through the individual‘s router. The RIAA, in their vigilant defense of copyrighted material, has gone too far and legislative action is needed to provide protection for <b>unwary</b> <b>consumers</b> from the aggressive tactics of the RIAA...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: In India egg {{is being}} {{promoted}} as complete food by the National Egg Co-cordination Committee (NECC) and being {{included in the}} free mid-day meal provided to school students in rural areas. The objective {{of the present study}} is to determine the prevalence and antibiotic resistance of Salmonellaon the shell and in the contents of eggs of commercial samples from the retail outlets of Kottayam, South India. Materials and Methods: Six hundred samples of eggs (150 each from commercial layer hens, non-commercial layerhens, duck and Japanese quail) were analysed for the prevalence of Salmonella as per United States Food and DrugAdministration Bacteriological analytical manual and the confirmed and serotyped strains were analysed for antibioticresistance by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Results: Five different serotypes such as S. weltevreden, S. worthington, S. dublin, S. bareilly and S. typhimurium were encounteredin the eggs of commercial layer hens, while backyard raised layen hen eggs had only S. bareilly and S. dublin. Japanese quail eggs showed prevalence of S. worthington, S. typhimurium and S. bareilly. S. enteritidis was encounteredonly in the duck eggs where the only other serotype was S. infantis. Conclusion: S. enteritidis prevalence was relativelyless when compared to reports from other countries. More than 50 % of duck eggs had Salmonella contamination inthe contents which pose threat to <b>unwary</b> <b>consumers.</b> Resistance to tetracycline, oxytetracycline and nalidixic acid wererelatively high among Salmonella isolates from eggs of commercial layer hens.
