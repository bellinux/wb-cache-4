40|$|When a <b>universal</b> <b>personal</b> <b>telecommunications</b> (UPT) user {{visits a}} mobile network, both {{terminal}} mobility and personal mobility are involved {{and it may}} take a long time for UPT call delivery to the UPT user because it is required to retrieve both the terminal mobility related data in mobile network and the UPT user related data in UPT database. If the UPT database also manages location and status information of the MT on which the UPT user has registered, incoming call delivery to the UPT user can be improved in a situation. Mobility management schemes for UPT users roaming in a mobile network are analyzed. The performance is evaluated in terms of signaling cost and the number of node accesses during an InCall registration...|$|E
40|$|Personal {{mobility}} {{is one of}} {{the goals}} of <b>Universal</b> <b>Personal</b> <b>Telecommunications</b> (UPT) being specified for future deployment. Most current efforts focus on telephony, with SS 7 signaling. However, many of the same goals can be accomplished for multimedia services, by using existing Internet protocols. We describe a multimedia call/conference setup protocol that provides personal videophone addresses, independent of the workstation a called party might be using at the time. The system is set up to use the existing Internet email address as a videophone address. Location and call handling information is kept at the subscriber's home site for improved access and privacy. 1 Introduction The use of multimedia has progressed from stand-alone applications, to point-to-point, mostly local applications such as video-on-demand or LAN-based video conferencing.

40|$|In the Personal Communication Networks (PCN), and the <b>Universal</b> <b>Personal</b> <b>Telecommunications</b> (UPT) {{services}} and possibly other services {{offered by the}} Advanced Intelligent Networks (AIN), customer records for call routing and other signaling functions can be distributed and replicated at multiple sites to improve access delay and system availability. We observe that these applications can tolerate data inconsistency among replicated records {{for a short period}} of time because the main consequence of accessing obsolete data is a small probability of call misroute. By exploiting this observation, we propose the Primary-Writer Protocol (PWP) as the concurrency control and commitment protocol for updating the replicated databases. The fraction of calls misrouted under the PWP is analyzed. Our results reveal that the fraction of calls misrouted under the PWP is very small for the expected customer behavior in the PCN (wireless networks), and the UPT and other AIN services.

40|$|This work {{looks into}} the {{monopoly}} associated with some telecommunication regulatory agencies inability to mandate the implementation of Mobile Number Portability (MNP) {{and its effects on}} subscribers who cannot retain their directory numbers when switching over to another service provider for reason best known to them. Many operators have claimed that Mobile Number Portability (MNP) is unnecessary and is an unwarranted expense, using assertions that the sector is highly competitive. Some mobile operators have gone to considerable trouble to make MNP difficult and have discouraged customers from exercising this right. They have suggested alternatives such as <b>personal</b> numbering and <b>Universal</b> <b>Personal</b> Telephony (UPT). However, these are not substitutes for MNP, but are expensive, value-added services. MNP should therefore strongly be encouraged by governments and Regulatory Agencies to recognize that Mobile Number Portability (MNP) {{is an essential part of}} the competitive framework and should be made legally binding on all operators and service providers.

40|$|Walking is now {{promoted}} {{as an alternative}} transport mode to polluting cars and as a successful means to improve health and longevity. Intelligent transport systems navigation ser- vices are now directly targeting travelers due to smartphones and their embedded sensors. However, {{after a decade of}} research, no <b>universal</b> <b>personal</b> navigation system has been successfully introduced and adopted to improve personalmobility. An analysis of the underlying reasons is conducted, looking at the engineering, human, ethical, and legal challenges. First, contrary to adopting classical mechanization equations linked to solid state physics, location technologies must address complex personal dynamics using connected objects. Second, human factors are often not suf- ficiently considered while designing new technologies. The needs and abilities of travelers are not systematically addressed from a user-centered perspective. Finally, people want to benefit from location-based services without sharing personal location data to uncontrolled third bodies. Europe is a pioneer in the protection of individuals from personal identification through data processing since location data has been recognized as personal data, but the challenges to enforce the regulation are numerous. The recommen- dation of ?privacy by design and default? is an interesting key to conceive the <b>universal</b> <b>personal</b> navigation solution.

40|$|Transport of information, i. e. communication, {{is playing}} an {{important}} role in modern information society. Therefore various new communication services and networks are being created. This thesis investigates in detail the communication service <b>Universal</b> <b>Personal</b> Telecommunication (UPT). UPT serves as a first step for realising <b>universal,</b> <b>personal</b> mobility for its users. Based upon this, an enhanced UPT service, called UPT+, is described and a prototype is developed. The prototype is based upon the architecture of Intelligent Networks and Common Channel Signalling System No. 7 (CCSS-# 7). It is formally specified using SDL. The prototype is implemented in C++ by means of two different code generators. Performance of both implementations is evaluated by extensive measurements. Suitable procedures for measurement and statistical evaluation of processing times are developed. Sheppard's correction is applied in evaluating measured data. Robust estimators are used in evaluating error bounds on the variances of the measured processing times. It is shown that a pure object-oriented implementation is working a little bit more slowly in most of the cases as compared to a conventional procedural implementation. The measured values are used in an existing analytical modelling of the network of Deutsche Telekom AG. It is shown that former theses severely underestimated the influence of the variance due to consideration of only a few different classes of processing times...|$|R
50|$|Being able to dial {{telephone}} numbers the way customers {{have come to}} expect is considered crucial for the convergence of classic telephone service (PSTN) and Internet telephony (Voice over IP, VoIP), and for the development of new IP multimedia services. The problem of a single <b>universal</b> <b>personal</b> identifier for multiple communication services can be solved with different approaches. One simple approach is the Electronic Number Mapping System (ENUM), developed by the IETF, using existing E.164 telephone numbers, protocols and infrastructure to indirectly access different services available under a single personal identifier. ENUM also permits connecting the IP world to the telephone system in a seamless manner.|$|R

In February 2006, this monopoly became a duopoly when a new telephone company and Internet service provider (ISP), du, was established to offer mobile services across the UAE and Internet and TV services to some free zone areas.

Earlier du provided triple play services to free zone areas under the name Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Company (EITC), which is still its legal name.|$|R

Previously proposed profile replication algorithms for improving the performance of such MMTs are either thresholdbased or off-line. In contrast to an off-line algorithm that assumes perfect knowledge of user calling and mobility statistics, we propose in this paper on-line replication algorithms that decides whether to distribute new replicas or delete existing replicas after serving each request, all based on the input sequence seen so far.

40|$|To provide <b>universal</b> <b>personal</b> communications, the {{next-generation}} PCNs {{will need}} to support {{a wide range of}} services requiring high bit rates. Transmitting high-speed data over wireless channels, however, is a difficult task. Recently, a new technique, known as multicode modulation, has been proposed to transmit high-speed data over wireless links. In this method, the high-rate information bits are serial-to-parallel converted to low-rate bit streams. Then the low-rate bits are modulated by direct sequence spread spectrum on a single carrier. The objective {{of this paper is to}} propose a low-complexity receiver structure for multicode modulation which uses Fast Walsh Transform (FWT). In addition, we will demonstrate that the use of coding in multicode modulation can significantly improve the system performance.
