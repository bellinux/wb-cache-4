5|$|Several {{short-lived}} {{buildings were}} later constructed {{on top of}} the motte. The first of these {{around the turn of the}} 19th century was a banqueting house constructed by Lord Stafford. In 1808 Marquess of Landsdowne built a mansion in a Gothic style {{on top of the}} motte <b>using</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the stone remains of the old keep; it became known as Landsdowne Castle, providing famous views across the town. Landsdowne Castle was pulled down in either 1815 or 1818, and most of the motte was subsequently flattened.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{marriage}} and children, Walter Jones reportedly had a wandering eye. On April 18, he met Sharon Kinne when {{she bought a}} Ford Thunderbird from his dealership <b>using</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the insurance payout from her husband's death, and the two began an affair shortly thereafter. Kinne viewed him as a prospect for a second husband, but Jones was uninterested in leaving his wife despite the rockiness of their relationship. When he declined {{to go on a}} trip to Washington with her in May, Kinne reluctantly went with her brother instead. Although the couple reunited on May 25, shortly after Kinne returned to Missouri, the relationship was quickly set on the rocks when Kinne told Jones that she was pregnant and he was the father of the baby. Jones, instead of responding with what Kinne expected to be an agreement to divorce his wife, ended the affair.|$|E

5|$|Stafford {{moved from}} New York to California in November 1946, {{continuing}} to host Chesterfield Supper Club from Hollywood. In 1948, she restricted her appearances {{on the show}} to Tuesdays, and Peggy Lee hosted the Thursday broadcasts. Stafford left the show when it was expanded to 30 minutes, making her final appearance on September 2, 1949. She returned to the program in 1954; it ended its run on NBC Radio the following year. During her time with Chesterfield Supper Club, Stafford revisited some of the folk music she had enjoyed as a child. Weston, her conductor on the programme, suggested <b>using</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the folk music for the show. With her renewed interest in folk tunes came an interest in folklore; Stafford established a contest to award a prize to the best collection of American folklore submitted by a college student. The annual Jo Stafford Prize for American Folklore was handled by the American Folklore Society, with the first prize of $250 awarded in 1949.|$|E
5|$|The SABRE engine design aims {{to avoid}} the {{historic}} weight-performance issue by <b>using</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the liquid hydrogen fuel to cool helium within a closed-cycle precooler, which quickly reduces {{the temperature of the}} air at the inlet. The air is then used for combustion in a similar manner to a conventional jet engine; once the helium has left the pre-cooler, it is further heated by the products of the pre-burner, giving it enough energy to drive the turbine and the liquid hydrogen pump. As a consequence of the air being cooled at all speeds, the jet can be built of light alloys and the weight is roughly halved. Additionally, more fuel can be burnt at high speeds. Beyond Mach5.5, the air would normally become unusably hot despite the cooling; accordingly, the air inlet is closed upon attaining this speed and the engine instead is solely fed via on-board liquid oxygen and hydrogen fuel, as in a traditional rocket.|$|E
