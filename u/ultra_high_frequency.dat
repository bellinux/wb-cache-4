The reader’s architecture is proposed and the design details of its RF frond-end are presented. The read range is formulated through calculating the time-averaging power absorbed by the tag and the signal-noise-ratio (SNR) of the demodulation, and accordingly RFID systems can be classified into tag-determining and reader-determining ones. It is concluded that the gain of the reader antenna, the phase noise of the local oscillation (LO) and the receive-transmit isolation coefficient dominate the demodulation output noise of the reader, and consequently the reader-determining maximum operational distance. A prototype reader working at the frequency of 915 MHz was built with off-the-shelf components and was evaluated with a commercial tag in an indoor environment. The measured results show that this RFID system is of tag-determining and has a read range of 8. 4 meters, which are in good agreement with the calculated results. 1...|$|R
40|$|Highly {{textured}} aluminum {{films have}} been grown on mono-crystalline lithiumtantalate (LiTaO 3) using ultra thin titanium films as adhesion layers for pure aluminum. Texture measurements {{by means of}} EBSD (Electron Backscatter Diffraction) show that {{the thickness of the}} intermediate titanium layer significantly influences texture and grain structure of the overlying 400 nm aluminum film. Increasing the thickness of the titanium layer from 0 nm to 20 nm leads to a change of aluminums texture from unoriented polycrystalline over highly oriented in single direction to highly oriented in twin structure. Highly textured or epitaxial thin aluminum films on piezoelectric single-crystalline substrates like LiTaO 3 have attracted much interest due to their high stress durability at <b>ultra</b> <b>high</b> <b>frequencies</b> since these films improve the performance of surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices significantly [1].

40|$|Abstract: Partial {{discharge}} (PD) diagnosis {{for large}} power transformers {{as one of}} the most powerful tools to evaluate insulating quality and characteristics should be carried out as permanent monitoring or onsite measurements with adequate sensitivity. This allows conditioned based maintenance strategies, serves asset appraisements and permits continuous risk assessment. Online/onsite electric PD measuring procedures according to the IEC 60270 standard so far show a limited reachable sensitivity e. g. caused by corona. Since PD also appear as source of mechanical waves in the ultra-sonic range and electromagnetic waves up to the UHF (<b>ultra</b> <b>high</b> <b>frequencies)</b> range additional acoustic or electromagnetic measurements are possible and helpful in online/onsite measurements. Comparative investigations with the acoustic and the UHF method revealed a very moderate damping of the UHF signals in oil and in the solid insulations in contrast to resulting attenuation of the acoustic signals. Thus a significantly higher sensitivity especially for hidden PD defects could be reached with the UHF method. Sensitive electromagnetic UHF PD measurements help to identify and localize faults which are not detectable with acoustic single impulses by simple averaging of the acoustic signals. Furthermore broad-band investigations of UHF spectra revealed cavity resonances which possibly make up the basis for advantageous narrow-band measurements...|$|R

A scanned laser beam detected the bulk and surface acoustic waves at the opposite surface of the thin silicon plate. Distinct amplitude patterns exhibiting the expected symmetry for Silicon were observed that alter in predictable ways as the acoustic focal point was moved throughout the plate. Predictions of the acoustic wave fields generated by the acoustic lens within and at the surface of the Silicon are being investigated through the angular spectrum of plane waves approach.
