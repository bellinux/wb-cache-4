5|$|On 4 November 2010, Qantas Flight 32, {{en route}} from Singapore Changi Airport to Sydney Airport, {{suffered}} an <b>uncontained</b> engine failure, resulting {{in a series of}} related problems, and forcing the flight to make an emergency landing. The plane safely returned to Singapore. There were no injuries to the passengers, crew or people on the ground despite debris falling onto the Indonesian island of Batam. The A380 was damaged sufficiently for the event to be classified as an accident. Qantas subsequently grounded all of its A380s that day subject to an internal investigation taken in conjunction with the engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce plc. A380s powered by Engine Alliance GP7000 were unaffected but operators of Rolls-Royce Trent 900-powered A380s were affected. Investigators determined that an oil leak, caused by a defective oil supply pipe, led to an engine fire and subsequent <b>uncontained</b> engine failure. Repairs cost an estimated 139 million (~US$145M). As other Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines also showed problems with the same oil leak, Rolls-Royce ordered many engines to be changed, including about half of the engines in the Qantas A380 fleet. During the airplane's repair, cracks were discovered in wing structural fittings which also resulted in mandatory inspections of all A380s and subsequent design changes.|$|E
5|$|The Board {{determined}} that the probable cause of this accident was the inadequate consideration given to human factors limitations in the inspection and quality control procedures used by United Airlines' engine overhaul facility. These resulted in the failure to detect a fatigue crack originating from a previously undetected metallurgical defect located in a critical area of the titanium-alloy stage 1 fan disk that was manufactured by General Electric Aircraft Engines. The <b>uncontained</b> {{manner in which the}} engine failed resulted in high-speed metal fragments being hurled from the engine; these fragments penetrated the hydraulic lines of all three independent hydraulic systems on board the aircraft, which rapidly lost their hydraulic fluid. The subsequent catastrophic disintegration of the disk resulted in the liberation of debris in a pattern of distribution and with energy levels that exceeded the level of protection provided by design features of the hydraulic systems that operate the DC-10's flight controls; the flight crew lost its ability to operate nearly all of them. Despite these losses, the crew was able to attain and then maintain limited control by using the throttles to adjust thrust to the remaining wing-mounted engines. By using each engine independently, the crew made rough steering adjustments, and by using the engines together they were able to roughly adjust altitude. The crew guided the crippled jet to Sioux Gateway Airport and lined it up for landing on one of the runways. Without the use of flaps and slats, they were unable to slow down for landing, and were forced to attempt landing at a very high ground speed. The aircraft also landed at an extremely high rate of descent due to the inability to flare (reduce the rate of descent before touchdown by increasing pitch). As a result, upon touchdown the aircraft broke apart, rolled over and caught fire. The largest section came to rest in a cornfield next to the runway. Despite the ferocity of the accident, 185 (62.5%) passengers and crew survived owing to a variety of factors including the relatively controlled manner of the crash and the early notification of emergency services.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Damage {{containment}} is {{an important}} technique for building self-healing database systems that can survive malicious attacks or operational mistakes. However, existing damage containment techniques are reactive and very limited in containing damage due to a relatively long detection latency. In this pa-per, we present an innovative multiphase damage containment approach which has one containing phase to proactively contain the damage with agility, and one or more later <b>uncontaining</b> phases to <b>uncontain</b> the objects that could be mistakenly contained during the first phase. Our approach can ensure that no damage caused by a malicious transaction will spread to any new update after the transaction is detected, although some availability can be temporarily lost. Our approach can contain multiple malicious transactions simul-taneously without delaying the containing phase of any newly detected attack. Our approach is practical, effective, efficient, and, to a large extent, assessment independent...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} applies a psycho-social {{approach to}} explore how SENCOs think about children with learning difficulties in mathematics, their feelings when performing mathematics tasks, and their own experiences of mathematics learning. Four SENCOs from different schools were interviewed twice. These participants were interviewed using a Free Association Narrative Interviewing (FANI) method, {{and were asked to}} complete a mathematics task. The mathematics task provided an experiential element through which participants communicated more unconscious or ‘unpolished’ feelings. This is a qualitative, exploratory piece of research. It comes from a psycho-social ontology, insofar as the participants are theorised in terms of psychoanalytic and societal concepts, and a psycho-social epistemology, in that knowledge of participants is gained through an interaction between a defended subject and researcher. As the researcher I understand people as psychologically defended against anxiety (Klein, 1952). Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis, while keeping in mind the ‘whole’ person. Thought was given to the researcher-participant relationship, to the narrative and to the ‘unspoken’ parts of the narrative which were interpreted using psychoanalytic frameworks. A reflective research diary and psycho-social supervision were used in order to enhance the understanding of the subjective researcher experience of dynamics underlying the interview process. A number of themes emerged from the data: Participants tended to attribute the causes of the children’s learning difficulties to within child difficulties or to teaching or parenting; participants’ negative feelings around mathematics were associated with rivalry, disempowerment and vulnerability, and shame at feeling unable to do something; the participants’ experiences of learning mathematics as a child appeared to {{have a profound effect on}} participants and how they approached mathematics tasks, and <b>uncontaining</b> school experiences of mathematics left a lasting impression. Limitations of the research and implications for teachers, SENCOs and EPs are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Therapists seeing refugee populations often {{struggle}} with the traditional boundaries of psychotherapy and conventional wisdom’s about therapeutic goals and practice. The social, political and cultural context of the therapeutic work throws up dilemmas and constraints {{that need to be}} better understood in working with these marginalized clients, particularly those in <b>uncontaining</b> environments such as South Africa. Although many refugees experience serious mental health problems and adjustment difficulties, the context in which treatment is offered impacts on the type of psychotherapeutic intervention and therapist stance that is optimal or possible. This study discusses presenting strengths, dilemmas and possible guiding therapeutic principles that arose from in-depth semi-structured interviews with 8 interviewees (4 psychotherapists and 4 refugee clients) concerning their experiences of conducting and being in medium term psychotherapy, looking at similarities and differences in observations. In accordance with the literature, this study found that the main descriptions of psychological distress discussed by the refugee clients included those caused by past trauma and those that were a response to current experiences. The prevalence of these symptoms stresses the importance of psychological intervention. The strengths of psychotherapy noted by refugee clients included: the preparation for psychotherapy through psycho-social workshops, attaining of both emotional and general support, the psych-social approach used by many of the therapists and the importance of foundational elements of psychotherapy, such as the relationship. This research project found that experiencing a containing therapeutic space was possible due to what refugees coined ‘the professionalism of the therapists’. Therapists raised such issues such as having {{to step out of the}} conventional therapist role, having to deal with the impact of the horror stories described by refugees, struggles to identify appropriate therapeutic approaches, difficulties in assisting refugees to establish sustainable support networks and not meeting refugees’ expectations that they will be ‘fully healed’ through therapy. Possible guiding therapeutic principles, such as working within the supportive framework of a two phased integrative framework, are also discussed. The study found that ideally speaking, therapists and refugee clients are more supported if therapy is offered as part of a multidimensional and multidisciplinary approach...|$|R

25|$|Southwest Airlines Flight 3472 was a {{regularly}} scheduled passenger flight operating from New Orleans International Airport, LA to Orlando International Airport, FL. On 27 August 2016, the Boeing 737-7H4 (WL), with 99 passengers and 5 crew, 12 minutes after departure from New Orleans, was climbing through 31,000 feet and heading east over the Gulf of Mexico when the aircraft's number one CFM International CFM56-7 engine suffered an <b>uncontained</b> engine failure. Debris {{from the engine}} punctured {{the left side of}} the fuselage causing a loss of cabin pressure and damaged the wing and empennage. Oxygen masks were deployed to passengers while the crew initiated an emergency descent to 10,000 feet. The aircraft then diverted to Pensacola International Airport for a safe landing on runway 17 about 20 minutes later without further incident. While the aircraft sustained substantial damage, there were no injuries.|$|E
25|$|Qantas Flight 32 was a Qantas {{scheduled}} passenger {{flight that}} suffered an <b>uncontained</b> engine failure on 4 November 2010 {{and made an}} emergency landing at Singapore Changi Airport. The failure {{was the first of}} its kind for the Airbus A380, the world's largest passenger aircraft. It marked the first aviation occurrence involving an Airbus A380. On inspection it was found that a turbine disc in the aircraft's No.2 Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engine (on the port side nearest the fuselage) had disintegrated. In addition to destruction of the engine, this caused damage to the nacelle, wing, fuel system, landing gear, flight controls, the controls for engine No.1 and a fire in the left inner wing fuel tank that self-extinguished. The failure was determined to have been caused by the breaking of a stub oil pipe which had been manufactured improperly.|$|E
25|$|Gardermoen has had {{considerable}} problems with fog and freezing rain, and has several times had a complete close-down. This {{was also a}} problem at Fornebu, and reported to be at Hurum as well. On average there is super cooled rain three times per month during the winter. The use of deicing fluids is restricted since the area underneath the airport contains the Tandrum Delta, one of the country's largest <b>uncontained</b> quaternary aquifers (underground water systems). On 14 December 1998, a combination of freezing fog and supercooled rain caused glaze at Gardermoen. At least twenty aircraft engines were damaged by ice during take-off, and five aircraft needed to make precautionary landings with only one working engine. On 18 January 2006, an Infratek deicing system was set up, that uses infrared heat in large hangar tents. It was hoped that it could reduce chemical deicers by 90%, but the technique has proved unsuccessful.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the other}} {{multi-engined}} jet aircraft in existence, when the Il-22 was being designed, either had the engines in a nacelle (singly or in pairs) directly attached to {{the underside of the}} wing or were buried in the wing itself. Clustering them in a nacelle offered several advantages over individual nacelles as it reduced overall drag and minimized interference drag, but had the major operational disadvantage that an <b>uncontained</b> fire in one engine could disable its neighbor as well and the early jet engines were not reliable, so this was a significant risk. Ilyushin chose to put the TR-1 engines ahead and below the wing leading edge on short horizontal pylons. This gave them the beneficial effect of acting as anti-flutter weights and proved to be more efficient aerodynamically than underwing nacelles. This also facilitated engine changes and maintenance by making them more accessible to the ground crews.|$|E

2500|$|In May 2010, The NTSB {{warned that}} the {{low-pressure}} turbine rotor disks could fail. Four <b>uncontained</b> failures of CF6-45/50 engines in the preceding two years prompted it to issue an [...] "urgent" [...] recommendation to increase inspections of the engines on U.S. aircraft : none of the four incidents of rotor disk imbalance and subsequent failure resulted in an accident, but parts of the engine did penetrate the engine housing in each case ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{investigation}} {{determined that}} the cause of the accident was a fatigue fracture leading to the <b>uncontained</b> failure of the 2nd stage disk of the low-pressure compressor of engine number four. [...] This resulted in an in-flight fire and damage to adjacent areas of the right wing and flaps to the extent that flight could not be sustained. The fatigue fracture formed due to the operation of the engine beyond its manufacturer’s assigned lifespan without assessment and lifespan enhancement by the manufacturer.|$|E
2500|$|Engine {{failures}} may {{be described}} as [...] "contained" [...] or [...] "uncontained". A contained engine failure {{is one in which}} components might separate inside the engine but either remain within the engine’s cases or exit the engine through the tail pipe. Engine enclosures are not designed to contain broken turbines, rather the turbines are designed not to break. An <b>uncontained</b> engine failure is more serious because pieces often exit the sides of the engine, posing potential danger to the aircraft structure and those within the plane.|$|E
2500|$|The NTSB also {{investigated}} {{whether the}} fuel/air mixture in the CWT {{could have been}} ignited by lightning strike, meteor strike, auto-ignition or hot surface ignition, a fire migrating to the CWT from another fuel tank via the vent system, an <b>uncontained</b> engine failure, a turbine burst in the air conditioning packs beneath the CWT, a malfunctioning CWT jettison/override pump, a malfunctioning CWT scavenger pump, or static electricity. After analysis the investigation determined that these potential sources were [...] "very unlikely" [...] {{to have been the}} source of ignition.|$|E

2500|$|In July 2014 {{there was}} an <b>uncontained</b> failure [...] of a fan rotor while the {{aircraft}} was preparing for take-off. The parts passed through a fuel tank and caused a fire, grounding the F-35 fleet. During high g-force maneuvering three weeks before flight, there was excessive rubbing at the seal between the fan blisk and the fan stator causing the failure. The engine [...] "flex" [...] generated a temperature of over 1,000°C (1,900°F) in materials designed to fail at 540°C (1,000°F). Micro cracks appeared in third-stage fan blades, according to program manager Christopher Bogdan, causing blades to separate from the disk. The failed blades punctured the fuel cell and hot air mixing with jet fuel caused the fire. As a short term fix, each aircraft is flown on a specific flight profile to allow the rotor seal to wear a mating groove in the stator to prevent excessive rubbing.|$|E
2500|$|The Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board (ARAIB) {{determined}} that a fire developed {{on or near the}} pallets containing dangerous goods but no physical evidence of the cause of the fire was found. The fire rapidly escalated to become large and <b>uncontained.</b> Without the data from the black boxes, the board was unable to determine exactly what took place in the cockpit during the fire or what happened with the aircraft after the last radio communication, but it was unlikely that the crew {{would have been able to}} extinguish the fire nor safely land the plane in the time that they had. It was not determined to exactly what extent the aircraft had been damaged or whether it had disintegrated prior to impact, but there was evidence of cargo containers striking the wings in flight, suggesting that at the very least the fire had caused some portions of the fuselage to separate from the aircraft in midair.|$|E

2500|$|The Lightning {{had several}} {{distinctive}} design features, {{the principal of}} these being the twin engine arrangement, notched delta wing, and low-mounted tailplane. The vertically stacked and longitudinally staggered engines were the solution devised by Petter to meet the conflicting requirements of minimizing frontal area, providing undisturbed engine airflow across a wide speed range, and packaging two engines to provide sufficient thrust to meet performance goals. The unusual over/under configuration allowed for the thrust of two engines, with the drag equivalent to only 1.5 engines mounted side-by-side, a reduction in drag of 25% over more conventional twin engine installations. The engines were fed by a single nose inlet (with inlet cone), with the flow split vertically aft of the cockpit, and the nozzles tightly stacked, effectively tucking one engine behind the cockpit. The result was a low frontal area, an efficient inlet, and excellent single-engine handling with no problems of asymmetrical thrust. However, because the engines were close together, an <b>uncontained</b> failure of one engine was likely to damage the other engine. If desired, an engine could be shut down in flight and the remaining engine run at a more efficient power setting which increased range or endurance; although this was rarely done operationally because {{there would be no}} hydraulic power if the remaining engine failed [...]|$|E
2500|$|... was sunk on 10 December 1941, {{from what}} was {{believed}} to have been hits by six aerial launched torpedoes and a 500kg bomb. However, an extensive 2007 survey by divers of the wreck of Prince of Wales determined definitively that there had been only 4 torpedo hits. Three of these four hits had struck the hull outside the area protected by the SPS. In the case of the fourth, the SPS holding bulkhead appeared intact abreast the area where the hull was hit. The conclusion of the subsequent 2009 paper and analysis was that the primary cause of the sinking was <b>uncontained</b> flooding along [...] "B" [...] propeller shaft. The propeller shaft external shaft bracket failed, and the movement of the unsupported shaft then tore up the bulkheads {{all the way from the}} external propeller shaft gland through to B Engine Room itself. This allowed flooding into the primary machinery spaces. The damage and flooding was exacerbated by poor damage control and the premature abandonment of the after magazines and a telephone communications switchboard. [...] "B" [...] propeller shaft had been stopped, and then restarted several minutes after being struck by a torpedo. Subsequent inquiries into her loss at the time identified the need for a number of design improvements, which were implemented to a lesser or greater degree on the other four ships of the class. Ventilation and the watertightness of the ventilation system were improved, while internal passageways within the machinery spaces were redesigned and the communications system made more robust. Improved propeller shaft glands and shaft locking gear were introduced. Some of the supposed failures of the ship were nevertheless predicated on the assumption that a torpedo had hit and defeated the SPS at or about frame 206 at the same time as the hit that damaged B propeller shaft. The 2007 survey's [...] video footage evidence showed however that the hull is basically intact in this area. The inability to survey the wreck during the war no doubt frustrated efforts to arrive at a definitive cause for the loss of Prince of Wales and, subsequently, that somewhat flawed analysis has led to a number of incorrect theories regarding the reasons for the sinking being inadvertently disseminated over the years.|$|E
