5|$|The {{mechanism}} for <b>unfolding</b> of globular proteins is necessarily general, but somewhat {{dependent on the}} amino acid sequence. Long sequences of alternating glycine and alanine {{have been shown to}} inhibit substrate <b>unfolding,</b> decreasing the efficiency of proteasomal degradation; this results in the release of partially degraded byproducts, possibly due to the decoupling of the ATP hydrolysis and <b>unfolding</b> steps. Such glycine-alanine repeats are also found in nature, for example in silk fibroin; in particular, certain Epstein–Barr virus gene products bearing this sequence can stall the proteasome, helping the virus propagate by preventing antigen presentation on the major histocompatibility complex.|$|E

40|$|Structure-based {{calculations}} of pK a values and electrostatic free energies of proteins assume that electrostatic {{effects in the}} <b>unfolded</b> state are negligible. In light of experimental evidence showing that this assumption is invalid for many proteins, and with increasing awareness that the <b>unfolded</b> state is more structured and compact than previously thought, a detailed examination of electrostatic effects in <b>unfolded</b> proteins is warranted. Here we address this issue with structure-based {{calculations of}} electrostatic interactions in <b>unfolded</b> staphylococcal nuclease. The approach involves the generation of ensembles of structures representing the <b>unfolded</b> state, and calculation of Coulomb energies to Boltzmann weight the <b>unfolded</b> state ensembles. Four different structural models of the <b>unfolded</b> state were tested. Experimental proton binding data measured with a variant of nuclease that is <b>unfolded</b> under native conditions were used to establish {{the validity of the}} calculations. These calculations suggest that weak Coulomb interactions are an unavoidable property of <b>unfolded</b> proteins. At neutral pH, the interactions are too weak to organize the <b>unfolded</b> state; however, at extreme pH values, where the protein has a significant net charge, the combined action {{of a large number of}} weak repulsive interactions can lead to the expansion of the <b>unfolded</b> state. The calculated pK a values of ionizable groups in the <b>unfolded</b> state are similar but not identical to the values in small peptides in water. These studies suggest that the accuracy of structure-based calculations of electrostatic contributions to stability cannot be improved unless electrostatic effects in the <b>unfolded</b> state are calculated explicitly...|$|R

40|$|For {{over fifty}} years, the <b>unfolded</b> state of {{proteins}} had been {{thought to be}} featureless and random. Experiments by Tanford and Flory confirmed that <b>unfolded</b> proteins possessed the same dimensions as those predicted of a random flight chain in good solvent. In the late eighties and early nineties, however, researchers began to notice structural trends in <b>unfolded</b> proteins. Some experiments showed that the <b>unfolded</b> state was {{very similar to the}} native state, while others indicated a conformational preference for the polyproline II helix in <b>unfolded</b> proteins. As a result, a paradox developed. How can <b>unfolded</b> proteins be both random and nonrandom at the same time? Current experiments and most theoretical simulations cannot characterize the <b>unfolded</b> state in high detail, so we have used the simplified hard sphere model of Richards to address this question. By modeling proteins as hard spheres, we can not only determine what interactions are important in the <b>unfolded</b> state of proteins, but we can address the paradox directly by investigating whether nonrandom behavior is in conflict with random coil statistics. Our simulations identify hundreds of disfavored conformations in short peptides, each of which proves that <b>unfolded</b> proteins are not at all random. Some interactions are important for the folded state of proteins as well. For example, we find that an α-helix cannot be followed directly by a β-strand because of steric considerations. The interactions outlined here limit the conformational possibilities of an <b>unfolded</b> protein far beyond what would be expected for a random coil. For a 100 -residue protein, we find that approximately 9 orders of magnitude of conformational freedom are lost because of iii local chain organization alone. Furthermore, we show that the existence of this organization is compatible with random coil statistics. Although our simulations cannot settle the controversy surrounding the <b>unfolded</b> state, we can conclude that new methods of characterizing the <b>unfolded</b> state are needed. Since <b>unfolded</b> proteins are not random coils, the methods developed for describing random coils cannot adequately describe the complexities of this diverse structural ensemble. ...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The <b>unfolded</b> protein {{response}} is {{triggered by the}} accumulation of misfolded proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum. Previous {{studies suggest that the}} <b>unfolded</b> protein {{response is}} activated in some cancer cell lines and involved in tumor development. The role of the <b>unfolded</b> protein response during leukemogenesis is unknown thus far. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Here, we assessed the induction of key effectors of the <b>unfolded</b> protein response in leukemic cells at diagnosis of 105 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients comprising all subtypes. We determined the formation of the spliced variant of the X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP 1) mRNA, as well as expression levels of calreticulin, GRP 78, and CHOP mRNA. RESULTS: The formation of the spliced variant of XBP 1 s was detectable in 16. 2 % (17 of 105) of AML patients. Consistent with activated <b>unfolded</b> protein response, this group also had significantly increased expression of calreticulin, GRP 78, and CHOP. AML patients with activated <b>unfolded</b> protein response had lower WBC counts, lactate dehydrogenase levels, and more frequently, secondary AML. The incidence of fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT 3) mutations was significantly lower in patients with activated <b>unfolded</b> protein response. In addition, an association was observed between activated <b>unfolded</b> protein response and deletion of chromosome 7. Finally, the clinical course of AML patients with activated <b>unfolded</b> protein response was more favorable with lower relapse rate (P = 0. 0182) and better overall (P = 0. 041) and disease-free survival (P = 0. 022). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the <b>unfolded</b> protein response is activated in a considerable subset of AML patients. AML patients with activated <b>unfolded</b> protein response present specific clinical characteristics and a more favorable course of the disease...|$|R

40|$|AbstractUnderstanding {{the role}} of electrostatics in protein {{stability}} requires knowledge of these interactions in both the folded and <b>unfolded</b> states. Electrostatic interactions can be probed experimentally by characterizing ionization equilibria of titrating groups, parameterized as pKa values. However, pKa values of the <b>unfolded</b> state are rarely accessible under native conditions, where the <b>unfolded</b> state has a very low population. Here, we report pKa values under nondenaturing conditions for two <b>unfolded</b> fragments of the protein G B 1 domain that mimic the <b>unfolded</b> state of the intact protein. pKa values were determined for carboxyl groups by monitoring their pH-dependent 13 C chemical shifts. Monte Carlo simulations using a Gaussian chain model provide corrections for changes in electrostatic interactions that arise from fragmentation of the protein. Most pKa values for the <b>unfolded</b> state agree well with model values, but some residues show significant perturbations that can be rationalized by local electrostatic interactions. The pH-dependent stability was calculated from the experimental pKa values of the folded and <b>unfolded</b> states and compared to experimental stability data. The use of experimental pKa values for the <b>unfolded</b> state results in significantly improved agreement with experimental data, as compared to calculations based on model data alone...|$|R

The availability of accurate pKa values for the folded state of HEWL and separate measurements of mutant-induced effects on the folded state pKa values, allows us to estimate the pKa values of seven acidic residues in the <b>unfolded</b> state of HEWL. Asp- 48 and Asp- 66 display pKa values of 2. 9 and 3. 1 in our analysis, thus representing the most depressed <b>unfolded</b> state pKa values observed to date. We observe a strong correlation between the folded state pKa values and the <b>unfolded</b> state pKa values of HEWL, thus suggesting that the <b>unfolded</b> state of HEWL possesses a large degree of native state characteristics...|$|R

In contrast, calnexin dissolves the oligomers, rendering <b>unfolded</b> VSVG ts 045 more mobile, and hence prevents poisoning of the ER...|$|R

5|$|The 19S {{particle}} in eukaryotes {{consists of}} 19 individual proteins and is divisible into two subassemblies, a 9-subunit base that binds {{directly to the}} α ring of the 20S core particle, and a 10-subunit lid. Six of the nine base proteins are ATPase subunits from the AAA Family, and an evolutionary homolog of these ATPases exists in archaea, called PAN (Proteasome-Activating Nucleotidase). The association of the 19S and 20S particles requires the binding of ATP to the 19S ATPase subunits, and ATP hydrolysis {{is required for the}} assembled complex to degrade folded and ubiquitinated proteins. Note that only the step of substrate <b>unfolding</b> requires energy from ATP hydrolysis, while ATP-binding alone can support all the other steps required for protein degradation (e.g., complex assembly, gate opening, translocation, and proteolysis). In fact, ATP binding to the ATPases by itself supports the rapid degradation of unfolded proteins. However, while ATP hydrolysis is required for <b>unfolding</b> only, it is not yet clear whether this energy may be used in the coupling of some of these steps.|$|E

40|$|The <b>unfolded</b> state {{ensemble}} of proteins {{has been described}} as a structurally featureless state. While this approach is supported by the fact that many <b>unfolded</b> proteins follow the scaling law behavior of a random coil, there is evidence that the <b>unfolded</b> states of various proteins are stabilized by native or non-native interactions. Recently, the existence of extensive non-native structure was reported for a repeat protein, which resulted in a scaling law exponent that is significantly smaller than that of a random polymer [Cortajarena et al., J. Mol. Biol. 382 (1), 203 – 212 (2008) ]. It was concluded that the high compactness of this protein stems from a significant fraction of interacting PPII helical segments in the <b>unfolded</b> state. In this study, we aim at providing possible molecular understanding of this anomalous compactness of the <b>unfolded</b> state and to investigate its origin. Using a hierarchy of computational models, we ask whether in general the <b>unfolded</b> state of a repeat protein is likely to be intrinsically more compact than the <b>unfolded</b> state of globular proteins, or whether this phenomenon depends mostly on the occurrence of a specific sequence that promotes PPII conformations. Our results suggest that the formation of the PPII conformation is indeed essential, yet the recurring sequence of repeat proteins promotes the interactions between these PPII segments and the formation of non-native interactions in the <b>unfolded</b> state...|$|R

40|$|Research on {{polypeptide}} <b>unfolded</b> {{states has}} received much more {{attention in the}} last decade or so than it has in the past. <b>Unfolded</b> states are thought to be implicated in various misfolding diseases and likely play crucial roles in protein folding equilibria and folding rates. Structural characterization of <b>unfolded</b> states has proven to be much more difficult than the now well established practice of determining the structures of folded proteins. This is largely because many core assumptions underlying folded structure determination methods are invalid for <b>unfolded</b> states. This has led to a dearth of knowledge concerning the nature of <b>unfolded</b> state conformational distributions. While many aspects of <b>unfolded</b> state structure are not well known, there does exist a significant body of work stretching back half a century that has been focused on structural characterization of marginally stable polypeptide systems. This body of work represents an extensive collection of experimental data and biophysical models associated with describing helix-coil equilibria in polypeptide systems.
