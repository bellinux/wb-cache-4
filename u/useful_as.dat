5|$|Among brachiopods {{only the}} lingulids have been fished commercially, and {{only on a}} very small scale. Brachiopods seldom settle on {{artificial}} surfaces, probably because they are vulnerable to pollution.

5|$|As a metal, {{titanium}} {{is recognized}} for its high strength-to-weight ratio. It {{is a strong}} metal with low density that is quite ductile (especially in an oxygen-free environment), lustrous, and metallic-white in color. The relatively high melting point (more than 1,650°C or 3,000°F) makes it <b>useful</b> <b>as</b> a refractory metal. It is paramagnetic and has fairly low electrical and thermal conductivity.|$|E

5|$|However {{effective}} dazzle camouflage {{may have}} been in World War I, it became less <b>useful</b> <b>as</b> rangefinders and especially aircraft became more advanced, and, {{by the time it was}} put to use again in World War II, radar further reduced its effectiveness.

5|$|Most enzyme {{kinetics}} studies concentrate on this initial, approximately linear part of enzyme reactions. However, {{it is also}} possible to measure the complete reaction curve and fit this data to a non-linear rate equation. This way of measuring enzyme reactions is called progress-curve analysis. This approach is <b>useful</b> <b>as</b> an alternative to rapid kinetics when the initial rate is too fast to measure accurately.|$|E

Because beryllium is expensive (many {{times more than}} titanium), hard to shape due to its brittleness, and toxic if mishandled, beryllium tweeters are limited to high-end home, pro audio, and public address applications.

A proposed dive profile is necessary for effective dive planning, both for estimating the required breathing gas composition and quantities, for planning decompression, and for choosing suitable diving equipment and other logistical aspects.|$|E
5|$|Another {{problem with}} the NIF lasers is that the flashtubes create a {{significant}} amount of heat, which warms the laser glass enough to cause it to deform. This requires a lengthy cooling-off period between shots, on the order of 12 hours. In practice, NIF manages a shot rate of less than one shot per day. To be <b>useful</b> <b>as</b> a power plant, about a dozen shots would have to take place every second, well beyond the capabilities of the NIF lasers.|$|E
