5|$|With the {{nomination}} undecided, Weed maneuvered for New York {{to send an}} <b>uncommitted</b> delegation to the 1848 Whig National Convention in Philadelphia, hoping to be a kingmaker in position to place former governor Seward on the ticket, or to get him high national office. He persuaded Fillmore to support an <b>uncommitted</b> ticket, {{though he did not}} tell the Buffaloan of his hopes for Seward. Weed was an influential editor, and Fillmore tended to cooperate with him for the greater good of the Whig Party. But Weed had sterner opponents, including Governor Young, who disliked Seward {{and did not want to}} see him gain high office.|$|E
5|$|As Nixon {{prepared}} for the August 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, he discussed possible running mates with his staff. Among these were Ronald Reagan, the conservative Governor of California, and the more liberal Mayor of New York City, John Lindsay. Nixon felt that these high-profile names could split the party, and looked for a less divisive figure. He did not indicate a preferred choice, and Agnew's name was not raised at this stage. Agnew was intending {{to go to the}} convention with his Maryland delegation as a favorite son, <b>uncommitted</b> to any of the main candidates.|$|E
5|$|David French {{wrote that}} the {{follow-up}} formations landing in Normandy were on average two days behind schedule and that had the 33rd Armoured Brigade, the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division and the 7th Armoured Division's infantry brigade landed on time, XXX Corps {{might have been able}} to secure Villers-Bocage, before the arrival of substantial German forces. Other historians wrote that substantial British forces remained <b>uncommitted</b> during the battle. Mungo Melvin wrote that although the 7th Armoured Division changed its organisation to a flexible combined arms structure, which was not done by the other British armoured divisions until after Operation Goodwood, neither the 131st Infantry Brigade nor the balanced divisional reserve of an armoured regiment and an infantry battalion were employed well.|$|E
5|$|It was {{customary}} in {{mid-19th century}} America {{for a candidate}} for high office not to appear to seek it. Thus, Fillmore remained at the comptroller's office in Albany, and made no speeches; the 1848 campaign was conducted in the newspapers and with addresses made by surrogates at rallies. The Democrats nominated Michigan Senator Lewis Cass for president, with General William O. Butler his running mate, {{but it would be}} a three-way fight as the Free Soil Party, opposed to the spread of slavery, chose former president Van Buren. There was a crisis among the Whigs when Taylor also accepted the presidential nomination of a group of dissident South Carolina Democrats. Fearing that Taylor would be an party apostate like Tyler, Weed in late August scheduled a rally in Albany aimed at electing an <b>uncommitted</b> slate of presidential electors, but Fillmore interceded with the editor, assuring him that Taylor was loyal to the party.|$|E
5|$|Minsk was liberated by the Soviet 1st and 3rd Belorussian Fronts on 3 July, but Model still {{hoped to}} re-establish {{the front to}} the west of the city, with the aid of {{divisions}} from Army Groups North and North Ukraine. However, German strength was unequal to the task, and he had been driven out of Vilnius and Baranovichi by 8 July. At the same time, the 1st Ukrainian Front (now commanded by Ivan Konev) and the 1st Belorussian Front's left wing (which had been <b>uncommitted</b> thus far) opened up a fresh offensive against Army Group North Ukraine. In this battle, the First Panzer Army managed to hold the line east of Lvov using Model's defensive tactics, but was forced to retreat when the Fourth Panzer Army, weakened by the steady flow of units to Army Group Centre, was unable to stem the Soviet penetrations of its front. Model stopped the Red Army's advance just short of Warsaw by 3 August, setting up a continuous front from south of Shaulyay to the right boundary on the Vistula near Pulawy.|$|E
5|$|The Clinton {{campaign}} had counted on winning the nomination by Super Tuesday and was unprepared financially and logistically for a prolonged effort; lagging in Internet fundraising as Clinton began loaning money to her campaign. There was continuous turmoil within the campaign staff {{and she made}} several top-level personnel changes. Obama won the next eleven February contests across the country, often by large margins and took a significant pledged delegate lead over Clinton. On March 4, Clinton broke the string of losses by winning in Ohio among other places, where her criticism of NAFTA, a major legacy of her husband's presidency, helped {{in a state where}} the trade agreement was unpopular. Throughout the campaign, Obama dominated caucuses, for which the Clinton campaign largely ignored preparation. Obama did well in primaries where African Americans or younger, college-educated, or more affluent voters were heavily represented; Clinton did well in primaries where Hispanics or older, non-college-educated, or working-class white voters predominated. Behind in delegates, Clinton's best hope of winning the nomination came in persuading <b>uncommitted,</b> party-appointed superdelegates.|$|E
5|$|Hannibal {{stood with}} his men in the weak center and held them to a {{controlled}} retreat. The crescent of Hispanic and Gallic troops buckled inwards as they gradually withdrew. Knowing {{the superiority of the}} Roman infantry, Hannibal had instructed his infantry to withdraw deliberately, creating an even tighter semicircle around the attacking Roman forces. By doing so, he had turned the strength of the Roman infantry into a weakness. While the front ranks were gradually advancing, the bulk of the Roman troops began to lose their cohesion, as they began crowding themselves into the growing gap. Soon they were compacted together so closely that they had little space to wield their weapons. In pressing so far forward in their desire to destroy the retreating and seemingly collapsing line of Hispanic and Gallic troops, the Romans had ignored (possibly due to the dust) the African troops that stood <b>uncommitted</b> on the projecting ends of this now-reversed crescent. This also gave the Carthaginian cavalry time to drive the Roman cavalry off on both flanks and attack the Roman center in the rear. The Roman infantry, now stripped of protection on both its flanks, formed a wedge that drove deeper and deeper into the Carthaginian semicircle, driving itself into an alley formed by the African infantry on the wings. At this decisive point, Hannibal ordered his African infantry to turn inwards and advance against the Roman flanks, creating an encirclement in one of the earliest known examples of a pincer movement.|$|E
5|$|Republicans were {{generally}} successful {{in state and}} local elections around the country in 1899, and McKinley was optimistic about his chances at re-election in 1900. McKinley's popularity in his first term assured him of renomination for a second. The only question about the Republican ticket concerned the vice presidential nomination; McKinley needed a new running mate as Hobart had died in late 1899. McKinley initially favored Elihu Root, who had succeeded Alger as Secretary of War, but McKinley decided that Root was doing too good a job at the War Department to move him. He considered other prominent candidates, including Allison and Cornelius N. Bliss, but none were as popular as the Republican party's rising star, Theodore Roosevelt. After a stint as Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Roosevelt had resigned and raised a cavalry regiment; they fought bravely in Cuba, and Roosevelt returned home covered in glory. Elected governor of New York on a reform platform in 1898, Roosevelt had his eye on the presidency. Many supporters recommended him to McKinley for the second spot on the ticket, and Roosevelt believed it would be an excellent stepping stone to the presidency in 1904. McKinley remained <b>uncommitted</b> in public, but Hanna was firmly opposed to the New York governor. The Ohio senator considered the New Yorker overly impulsive; his stance was undermined by the efforts of political boss and New York Senator Thomas C. Platt, who, disliking Roosevelt's reform agenda, sought to sideline the governor by making him vice president.|$|E
25|$|The North Carolina primary {{was also}} run on March 15, 2016, and also {{alongside}} the primaries of the Republican, Democratic, and Constitution parties. Gary Johnson won against competing candidates with 42% {{of the primary}} vote, overcoming 35% of the electorate who remained <b>uncommitted</b> to any candidate, and far ahead of third-place finisher John David Hale with 6%. Most urban counties showed majority support for Johnson, particularly in the state's largest city, Charlotte, and its capital, Raleigh, while <b>uncommitted</b> votes mostly came from rural counties across the state. Many counties were tied between Johnson and the <b>uncommitted</b> vote, {{but a number of}} counties in the east recorded ties between Johnson and other candidates such as John David Hale and Joy Waymire, albeit {{with a small amount of}} votes. In Gates County, a four-way tie was recorded when Gary Johnson, Cecil Ince, and Derrick Michael Reid recorded one vote each, with an additional <b>uncommitted</b> voter accounted for. Tyrrell was the only county in the entire state where Johnson did not win or tie; instead Hale tied with an <b>uncommitted</b> voter, with one vote each.|$|E

25|$|Nine {{other states}} have small numbers of <b>uncommitted</b> delegates.|$|E
25|$|Secured delegates: These columns do not {{list the}} 117 unbound RNC delegates {{that are not}} a part of the primary {{election}} process. Five candidates secured delegates, they are listed in a candidates' column when they are allocated to him or when they after or at their election have pledge to him. Huntsman's (the fifth candidate) two New Hampshire delegates are listed as <b>uncommitted.</b> These are numbers that the candidates have actually secured for themselves, not projected counts or counts after a candidate has suspended his campaign and released his candidates. The <b>uncommitted</b> column (last) lists both elected delegates that are still <b>uncommitted</b> and unallocated delegates.|$|E
25|$|N.B: The grey {{counties}} in Michigan denote that the counties are <b>uncommitted</b> for either candidate.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of Hillary Clinton's {{suspending}} her campaign early on June 7, 2008, the superdelegate count was 246½ for her, and 478 for Barack Obama, with 99 still <b>uncommitted</b> of the 823½ total then existing.|$|E
25|$|As {{the first}} state with {{non-binding}} caucuses Wyoming elected delegates in the week of March 5. At the county conventions one delegate was elected as <b>uncommitted,</b> while eight delegates was committed to Romney, two to Santorum and one to Paul.|$|E
25|$|Kabila had {{declared}} himself a Marxist and {{an admirer of}} Mao Zedong. He had been waging armed rebellion in eastern Zaire {{for more than three}} decades, though Che Guevara in his account of {{the early years of the}} conflict portrayed him as an <b>uncommitted</b> and uninspiring leader.|$|E
25|$|In {{an effort}} to bolster command {{and control of the}} {{northern}} shoulder, Eisenhower appointed Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery, commander of the 21st Army Group, commander of all troops north of the German advance on 20 December. This was done in part because Montgomery controlled an <b>uncommitted</b> reserve, the British XXX Corps.|$|E
25|$|It {{is thought}} that through a {{combination}} of biochemical and biophysical stimuli, the <b>uncommitted</b> stem cells of the embryo will undergo differentiation into certain cell lineages. However the exact mechanism and signalling pathways are still unclear. Studies have shown that embryonic stem cells are more mechanosensitive than their differentiated counterparts.|$|E
25|$|CNN's poll {{conducted}} after the debate found that 54% {{of those surveyed}} thought that Obama had won and 30% felt McCain had won. In CBS's poll of <b>uncommitted</b> voters, 40% felt Obama had won, 26% thought McCain had won, and 34% {{said it was a}} tie. Times Mark Halperin graded Obama's performance a B+ and McCain's performance a B.|$|E
25|$|Each state's {{two members}} of the Republican National Committee, and the party chairs of each U.S. state and the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Northern Mariana Islands are the only {{automatic}} delegates to the party's national convention. These superdelegates while officially <b>uncommitted,</b> may also publicly endorse a candidate.|$|E
25|$|The Missouri primary ran on March 15, 2016, {{alongside}} {{those of}} the Republican, Democratic, and Constitution parties. 40% of the electorate voted to stand <b>uncommitted</b> to any candidate. Austin Petersen, running in his home state, finished second with 29% of the statewide vote, which was double that of Steve Kerbel from Colorado, who finished third with 14%. Petersen comfortably won the support of voters in the state's capital, Jefferson City, and its surrounding counties, but fell heavily behind the <b>uncommitted</b> vote in the state's two largest cities, Kansas City and St. Louis. Kerbel won three counties around Springfield, while Marc Allan Feldman, Cecil Ince, and Rhett Smith all won a sprawl of counties across the state; {{in most of these}} counties, however, only a single vote was cast. No votes were cast for Libertarian Party candidates in the northwestern counties of Harrison, Holt, Mercer, and Worth.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{research}} suggests the social component of ritual. For instance, {{findings suggest that}} ritual performance indicates group commitment and prevents the <b>uncommitted</b> from gaining membership benefits. Ritual may aid in emphasizing moral values that serve as group norms and regulate societies. It may also strengthen commitment to moral convictions and likelihood of upholding these social expectations. Thus, performance of rituals may foster social group stability.|$|E
25|$|Among eight major {{candidates}} for the nomination Dodd, even with later states where {{he was on the}} ballot after withdrawal, won last place by popular vote in primary (after Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, John Edwards, Bill Richardson, Dennis Kucinich, Joe Biden and Mike Gravel, also including <b>uncommitted</b> delegates and scattering votes). He won a total of 25,252 votes in delegates primaries and 9,940 in penalized contests.|$|E
25|$|While officially <b>uncommitted</b> {{until the}} convention, the superdelegates may {{publicly}} endorse or {{commit to a}} candidate at any time. The presidential candidates compete heavily for these commitments. News organizations survey the superdelegates periodically throughout the election season and try to calculate how many have committed {{to each of the}} candidates. The media often include these superdelegate estimates in their reporting on the race, leading to differing delegate counts from various news sources.|$|E
25|$|Unlike Rupert, Cromwell had {{roughly half}} of his wing <b>uncommitted,</b> as only {{the front line of}} Cromwell's wing had taken part in the defeat of Langdale. He sent only four {{divisions}} (roughly two regiments) after Langdale, and turned his reserves against the left flank and rear of the Royalist centre. At about the same time, Okey's dragoons mounted their horses and charged from the Sulby Hedges against {{the right wing of the}} Royalist infantry, as did some of Ireton's regiments which had partly rallied.|$|E
25|$|With {{the centre}} engaged, Archelaus {{extended}} his right wing in an outflanking maneuver. Hortensius attempted to counter, but, {{in doing so}} left his unit vulnerable to a counterattack. In response to this vulnerability, Archelaus' cavalry launched a successful cavalry charge and engaged and surrounded Hortensius' troops. Sulla, who had up until this point remained <b>uncommitted</b> in battle, moved quickly to alleviate the pressure on Hortensius' troops. Archelaus, recognizing Sulla's maneuver by the dust rising from the ground, recalled some of his cavalry and instead ordered them to attack the weakened Roman right flank.|$|E
25|$|The {{rest of the}} {{recently}} expanded Politburo (Rykov, Mikhail Tomsky, Bukharin) was at first <b>uncommitted,</b> but eventually joined the troika. Stalin's power of patronage {{in his capacity as}} general secretary clearly played a role, but Trotsky and his supporters later concluded that a more fundamental reason was the process of slow bureaucratization of the Soviet regime once the extreme conditions of the Civil War were over. Much of the Bolshevik elite wanted 'normalcy,' while Trotsky was personally and politically personified as representing a turbulent revolutionary period that they would much rather leave behind.|$|E
25|$|The Illinois primary {{required}} {{voters to}} select individual delegates, not presidential candidates. Most Illinois delegation members were <b>uncommitted</b> and were controlled or influenced by Chicago Mayor and Cook County Democratic Party chairman Richard J. Daley. The delegation was challenged by McGovern supporters {{arguing that the}} results of the primary did not create a diverse enough delegation in terms of women and minorities. The credentials committee, headed by Patricia Roberts Harris, rejected the entire elected delegation, including elected women and minorities, and seated an unelected delegation led by Chicago Alderman William S. Singer and civil rights activist Jesse Jackson that pledged to McGovern.|$|E
25|$|Rebuffed by Congress, Wilson {{announced}} on April 30, 1980, Statehood Day in Louisiana, {{that he would}} challenge Leach in the 1980 nonpartisan blanket primary. A Shreveport Journal poll showed Wilson with a slim lead {{at the time in}} a potential re-run of a race against Leach. There was, however, a large bloc of <b>uncommitted</b> voters. Wilson said that he expected to raise and spend $500,000 for the second race because national Republicans had again targeted the Fourth District as one of 35 in the nation where the GOP stood a chance of winning a Democratic seat.|$|E
25|$|The {{international}} community considers Israeli settlements {{a violation of}} the Fourth Geneva Convention's prohibition on the transfer of an occupying power's civilian population into occupied territory and are as such illegal under international humanitarian law. Israel disputes that the Fourth Geneva Convention applies to the Palestinian territories as they had not been legally held by a sovereign prior to Israel taking control of them. Only the U.K. and Pakistan officially recognised the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan's annexation of the West Bank with all other members of the UN remaining <b>uncommitted.</b> This view has been rejected by the International Court of Justice and the International Committee of the Red Cross.|$|E
25|$|As {{yet there}} are no {{universities}} within Wiltshire, except that Bath Spa University has a centre at Corsham Court in Corsham, and Oxford Brookes University maintains a minor campus in Swindon (almost 50km from Oxford). Outline plans for a projected University of Swindon or University of Wiltshire were announced by the Borough of Swindon in November 2008, but the scheme remains <b>uncommitted.</b> Swindon therefore remains the UK's largest centre of population without its own university. The closest university to Wiltshire's county town of Trowbridge is the University of Bath. Wiltshire is therefore {{one of the few}} remaining English counties without a university or university college.|$|E
25|$|CNN's poll {{conducted}} after the debate found that 58% {{of those surveyed}} thought that Obama had won and 31% felt McCain had won. In CBS's poll of <b>uncommitted</b> voters, 53% felt Obama had won and 22% thought McCain had won, Obama's largest margin of victory of the three debates. A Politico poll of undecided voters, conducted over a 15-minute period following {{the completion of the}} presidential debate, showed that 49% felt Obama won, while 46% believed McCain won the debate. Among respondents not identified with either major political party, McCain was judged the night’s winner, 51-42 percent. Obama’s most important lead may have come among Hispanic voters, who said he bested McCain by a 50-36 percent margin.|$|E
25|$|In June 1594 the Portuguese and Lascarins (now 15,000 strong) marched {{out from}} Sitawaka. Their first stop was Attanagalla. After three days they reached Menikkadawara, but the monsoon rains delayed them there for {{fourteen}} days. Then they advanced towards Galbodagama (which {{stood at the}} site of the current-day Polgahawela railway station), burning and destroying the countryside of Seven Korale. The prince of Seven Korale, <b>uncommitted</b> thus far, became a Christian and declared his allegiance to the Portuguese. Leaving Seven Korale, the army camped in the vicinity of Balana Pass, gateway to the Kingdom of Kandy, to await the princess and the force from Mannar. Once these had arrived, Sousa advanced toward the pass.|$|E
25|$|Heightened brain {{plasticity}} in infants impacts later language development. Recent {{studies show that}} even brief exposure to a language in infancy changes how the brain processes a second-language acquisition. Participants in the studies who had transient language exposure as an infant or were multilingual showed greater brain activation in non-verbal working memory patterns, compared to monolingual speakers. The measure of <b>uncommitted</b> neural circuitry in infants can be accounted for {{in the perception of}} nonnative language at early stages of language acquisition. Research has shown that infants who show proficiency in nonnative phonetic perception at 7 months have slower language development than those who show proficiency in native phonetic perception. This research supports the Native Language Magnet/Neural Commitment Theory originally proposed by Patricia K. Kuhl.|$|E
25|$|Brown's name began {{appearing}} on primary ballots in May {{and he won}} in Maryland, Nevada, and {{his home state of}} California. He missed the deadline in Oregon, but he ran as a write-in candidate and finished in third behind Jimmy Carter and Senator Frank Church of Idaho. Brown is often credited with winning the New Jersey and Rhode Island primaries, but in reality, <b>uncommitted</b> slates of delegates that Brown advocated in those states finished first. With support from Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards, Brown won a majority of delegates at the Louisiana delegate selection convention; thus Louisiana was the only southern state to not support Southerners Carter or Alabama Governor George Wallace. Despite this success, he was unable to stall Carter's momentum, and his rival was nominated on the first ballot at the 1976 Democratic National Convention. Brown finished third with roughly 300 delegate votes, narrowly behind Congressman Morris Udall and Carter.|$|E
25|$|In {{the middle}} of March the {{district}} auditor, Brian Singleton, {{sent a letter to}} every councillor warning them of the legal dangers of delaying setting a rate. At a special council meeting called by the Conservative group on 22 March 1985, the Labour chair of the Finance Committee Harry Rutherford proposed an £83m budget which included <b>uncommitted</b> growth of only £300,000 instead of the £4.2m wanted by the Leader; he attracted the support of the opposition Conservative and Alliance councillors together with 12 other Labour rebels and the budget was passed. The chief whip of the Labour group Stephen Byers said that the auditor would have to check the budget was legal. Four of the thirteen Labour rebels were suspended from the party for terms between six and twelve months, and the others were reprimanded and required to give a written undertaking to observe group policy in future.|$|E
