5|$|In December 2014, USB-IF {{submitted}} USB3.1, <b>USB</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Delivery</b> 2.0 and USB Type-C specifications to the IEC (TC 100– Audio, {{video and}} multimedia systems and equipment) {{for inclusion in}} the international standard IEC 62680 Universal Serial Bus interfaces for data and power, which is currently based on USB 2.0.|$|E
5|$|The {{upcoming}} <b>USB</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Delivery</b> Specification revision3.0 defines {{new power}} rules based on supplied wattage. Programmable power supply protocol allows granular control over VBUS power in 10mV steps to facilitate constant current or constant voltage charging. Revision 3.0 also adds extended configuration messages, fast role swap, and deprecates the BFSK protocol.|$|E
5|$|As of <b>USB</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Delivery</b> Specification revision2.0, version1.2, the six fixed power {{profiles}} {{for power}} sources have been deprecated. USB PD Power Rules replace power profiles, defining four normative voltage levels at 5V, 9V, 15V, and 20V. Instead of six fixed profiles, power supplies may support any maximum source output power from 0.5W to 100W.|$|E

5|$|The <b>USB</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Delivery</b> Specification revision2.0 (USB PD rev. 2) {{has been}} {{released}} {{as part of the}} USB3.1 suite. It covers the Type-C cable and connector with four power/ground pairs and a separate configuration channel, which now hosts a DC coupled low-frequency BMC-coded data channel that reduces the possibilities for RF interference. Power Delivery protocols have been updated to facilitate Type-C features such as cable ID function, Alternate Mode negotiation, increased VBUS currents, and VCONN-powered accessories.|$|E
5|$|Full-featured USB3.1 Type-C cables are {{electronically}} marked cables {{that contain}} {{a full set}} of wires and a chip with an ID function based on the configuration data channel and vendor-defined messages (VDMs) from the <b>USB</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Delivery</b> 2.0 specification. USB Type-C devices also support power currents of 1.5A and 3.0A over the 5V power bus in addition to baseline 900mA; devices can either negotiate increased USB current through the configuration line or they can support the full Power Delivery specification using both BMC-coded configuration line and legacy BFSK-coded VBUS line.|$|E
5|$|In July 2012, the USB Promoters Group {{announced}} the finalization of the <b>USB</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Delivery</b> (PD) Specification (USB PD rev. 1), an extension that specifies using certified PD aware USB cables with standard USB Type-A and Type-B connectors to deliver increased power (more than 7.5W) to devices with larger power demand. Devices can request higher currents and supply voltages from compliant hosts up to 2A at 5V (for a power consumption {{of up to}} 10W), and optionally up to 3A or 5A at either 12V (36W or 60W) or 20V (60W or 100W). In all cases, both host-to-device and device-to-host configurations are supported.|$|E
5000|$|The iPhone 3G and 3GS are {{compatible}} with the same dock, sold separately, but not the first generation model's dock.

500|$|The Alternate Mode reconfigures {{the four}} SuperSpeed {{differential}} pairs present in USB-C {{to carry the}} three HDMI TMDS channels and the clock signal. The two Sideband Use pins (SBU1 and SBU2) are used to carry the HDMI Ethernet and Audio Return Channel and the Hot Plug Detect functionality (HEAC+/Utility pin and HEAC−/HPD pin). As {{there are not enough}} reconfigurable pins remaining in USB-C to accommodate the DDC clock (SCL), DDC data (SDA), and CEC – these three signals are bridged between the HDMI source and sink via the <b>USB</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Delivery</b> 2.0 (USB-PD) protocol, and are carried over the USB-C Configuration Channel (CC) wire. This is possible because the cable is [...] electronically marked (i.e., it contains a USB-PD node) that serves to tunnel the DDC and CEC from the source over the Configuration Channel to the node in the cable, these USB-PD messages are received and relayed to the HDMI sink as regenerated DDC (SCL and SDA signals), or CEC signals.|$|E

40|$|Abstract— 3 -D {{integrated}} circuits promise high bandwidth, low latency, low device power, {{and a small}} form factor. Increased device density and asymmetrical packaging, however, renders the design of 3 -D <b>power</b> <b>delivery</b> a challenge. We investigate in this paper various methods to improve 3 -D <b>power</b> <b>delivery.</b> We analyze the impact of through-silicon via (TSV) size and spacing, of controlled collapse chip connection (C 4) spacing, and of dedicated <b>power</b> <b>delivery</b> TSVs. In addition to considering typical cylindrical or square metal-filled TSVs (core TSVs), we also investigate using coaxial TSVs for <b>power</b> <b>delivery</b> resulting in reduced routing blockages and added coupling capacitance. Our 3 -D evaluation system is composed of a quad-core chip multipro-cessor, a memory die, and an accelerator engine, and it is evaluated using representative SPEC benchmark traces. This is the first detailed architectural-level analysis for 3 -D <b>power</b> <b>delivery.</b> Our findings provide clear guidelines for 3 -D <b>power</b> <b>delivery</b> design.
