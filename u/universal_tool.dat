6000|$|In {{considering}} the thought {{and work of}} Karl Marx, the reader must {{bear in mind the}} epoch in which that work commenced. The intellectual world was then under the sway of an organized mass of ideas known as the Science of Political Economy, a mass of ideas that has now not so much been examined and refuted as slipped away imperceptibly from its hold upon the minds of men. In the beginning, in the hands of Adam Smith--whose richly suggestive book is now all too little read--political economy was a broad-minded and sane inquiry into the statecraft of trade based upon current assumptions of private ownership and personal motives, but from him it passed to men of perhaps, in some cases, quite equal intellectual energy but inferior vision and range. The history of Political Economy is indeed {{one of the most striking}} instances of the mischief wrought by intellectual minds devoid of vision, in the entire history of human thought. Special definition, technicality, are the stigmata of second-rate intellectual men; they cannot work with the <b>universal</b> <b>tool,</b> they cannot appeal to the general mind. They must abstract and separate. On such men fell the giant's robe of Adam Smith, and they wore it after their manner. Their arid atmospheres are intolerant of clouds, an outline that is not harsh is abominable to them. They criticized their master's vagueness and must needs mend it. They sought to give political economy a precision and conviction such a subject will not stand. They took such words as [...] "value," [...] an incurably and necessarily vague word, [...] "rent," [...] the name of the specific relation of landlord and tenant, and [...] "capital," [...] and sought to define them with relentless exactness and use them with inevitable effect. So doing they departed more and more from reality. They developed a literature more abundant, more difficult and less real than all the exercises of the schoolmen put together. To use common words in uncommon meanings is to sow a jungle of misunderstanding. It was only to be expected that the bulk of this economic literature resolves upon analysis into a ponderous, intricate, often astonishingly able and foolish wrangling about terminology.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the quick-and-easy undernutrition screening tools, ie, Short Nutritional Assessment Questionnaire and Malnutrition <b>Universal</b> Screening <b>Tool,</b> in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with respect to their accuracy in detecting undernutrition measured by a low-fat free mass index (FFMI; calculated as kg/m(2)), and secondly, to assess their association with postoperative adverse outcomes. Between February 2008 and December 2009, a single-center observational cohort study was performed (n= 325). A low FFMI was set at ≤ 14. 6 in women and ≤ 16. 7 in men measured using bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy. To compare the accuracy of the Malnutrition <b>Universal</b> Screening <b>Tool</b> and Short Nutritional Assessment Questionnaire in detecting low FFMI sensitivity, specificity, and other accuracy test characteristics were calculated. The associations between the Malnutrition <b>Universal</b> Screening <b>Tool</b> and Short Nutritional Assessment Questionnaire and adverse outcomes were analyzed using logistic regression analyses with odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) presented. Sensitivity and receiver operator characteristic-based area under the curve to detect low FFMI were 59 % and 19 %, and 0. 71 (95 % CI: 0. 60 to 0. 82) and 0. 56 (95 % CI: 0. 44 to 0. 68) for the Malnutrition <b>Universal</b> Screening <b>Tool</b> and Short Nutritional Assessment Questionnaire, respectively. Accuracy of the Malnutrition <b>Universal</b> Screening <b>Tool</b> improved when age and sex were added to the nutritional screening process (sensitivity 74 %, area under the curve: 0. 72 [95 % CI: 0. 62 to 0. 82]). This modified version of the Malnutrition <b>Universal</b> Screening <b>Tool,</b> but not the original Malnutrition <b>Universal</b> Screening <b>Tool</b> or Short Nutritional Assessment Questionnaire, was associated with prolonged intensive care unit and hospital stay (odds ratio: 2. 1, 95 % CI: 1. 3 to 3. 4; odds ratio: 1. 6, 95 % CI: 1. 0 to 2. 7). The accuracy to detect a low FFMI was considerably higher for the Malnutrition <b>Universal</b> Screening <b>Tool</b> than for the Short Nutritional Assessment Questionnaire, although still marginal.

50|$|Yet the {{timekeeping}} {{device with}} such accuracy would eventually also allow {{the determination of}} longitude accurately, making the device a fundamental key to the modern age. Following Harrison, the marine timekeeper was reinvented yet again by John Arnold who while basing his design on Harrison's most important principles, {{at the same time}} simplified it enough for him to produce equally accurate but far less costly marine chronometers in quantity from around 1783. Nonetheless, for many years even {{towards the end of the}} 18th century, chronometers were expensive rarities, as their adoption and use proceeded slowly due to the precision manufacturing necessary and hence high expense. The expiry of Arnold's patents at the end of the 1790s enabled many other watchmakers including Thomas Earnshaw to produce chronometers in greater quantities at less cost even than those of Arnold. By the early 19th century, navigation at sea without one was considered unwise to unthinkable. Using a chronometer to aid navigation simply saved lives and ships—the insurance industry, self-interest, and common sense did the rest in making the device a <b>universal</b> <b>tool</b> of maritime trade.|$|E
50|$|Amira is an {{extendable}} {{software system}} for scientific visualization, data analysis, and presentation of 3D and 4D data. It {{is being used}} by several thousand researchers and engineers in academia and industry around the world.Its flexible user interface and modular architecture make it a <b>universal</b> <b>tool</b> for processing and analysis of data from various modalities; e.g. micro-CT, PET, Ultrasound. Its ever-expanding functionality has made it a versatile data analysis and visualization solution, applicable to and being used in many fields, such as microscopy in biology and materials science, molecular biology, quantum physics, astrophysics, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), finite element modeling (FEM), non-destructive testing (NDT), and many more. One of the key features, besides data visualization, is Amira’s set of tools for image segmentation and geometry reconstruction. This allows the user to mark (or segment) structures and regions of interest in 3D image volumes using automatic, semi-automatic, and manual tools. The segmentation can then {{be used for a}} variety of subsequent tasks, such as volumetric analysis, density analysis, shape analysis, or the generation of 3D computer models for visualization, numerical simulations, or rapid prototyping or 3D printing, to name a few. Other key Amira features are multi-planar and volume visualization, image registration, filament tracing, cell separation and analysis, tetrahedral mesh generation, fiber-tracking from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, skeletonization, spatial graph analysis, and stereoscopic rendering of 3D data over multiple displays including CAVEs (Cave automatic virtual environments).As a commercial product Amira requires the purchase of a license or an academic subscription.
