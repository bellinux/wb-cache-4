40|$|Conference Theme: Bridges and Structures Sustainability - Seeking Intelligent SolutionsBecause of the {{convenience}} in construction and quality control, the precast segmental method has been increasingly used {{not only in}} bridge decks, but also in bridge piers. For example, this is {{being used in the}} bridge piers of the approaches in the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge currently <b>under</b> construction. As <b>ship</b> collision with bridge piers {{is one of the most}} frequent accidents that may lead to bridge failure, attention has been drawn to the safety of precast concrete segmental bridge piers <b>under</b> <b>ship</b> impact. A numerical study was carried out to analyse the structural behaviour of typical bridge piers <b>under</b> <b>ship</b> impact. Two different designs of bridge pier were considered, namely the cast-in-place reinforced concrete and post-tensioned precast concrete segmental versions. Finite element analyses of the bridge piers <b>under</b> <b>ship</b> impact were conducted taking into account the joints, prestressing tendons, material nonlinearity, etc. The effects of location of ship impact were examined. Results of impact force and the displacement at pier top end were examined. In the light of the numerical results, the design impact loads prescribed by the Chinese bridge design code, Eurocode and AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications were evaluated.

This Bill would have provided the government with the power to remove any ship in the territorial waters of Australia (s 4), to use reasonable force to do so (s 5), to provide that any person who was on the ship may be forcibly returned to the <b>ship</b> (<b>s</b> 6), that no civil or criminal proceedings may be taken against the Australian government or any of its officers for removing the ship or returning people to it (s 7), that no court proceedings are available to prevent the ship from being removed and from people being returned to it (s 8), and that no asylum applications may be made by people on board the <b>ship</b> (<b>s</b> 9). The bill was intended to enter into force at 9:00 Australian Eastern Standard Time, 29 August 2001 (s 2); thus making the bill retroactive. It also attempted to ensure actions taken prior to legislation passage to remove ship and return people to it would have been treated as legal.|$|R
