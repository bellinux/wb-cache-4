25|$|The {{simplest}} {{numeral system}} is the <b>unary</b> numeral system, in which every natural number is represented by a corresponding number of symbols. If the symbol / is chosen, for example, then the number seven would be represented by ///////. Tally marks represent one such system still in common use. The <b>unary</b> system is only useful for small numbers, although it {{plays an important role}} in theoretical computer science. Elias gamma coding, which is commonly used in data compression, expresses arbitrary-sized numbers by using <b>unary</b> to indicate the length of a binary numeral.|$|E
25|$|In C++ and PHP, <b>unary</b> prefix & {{before a}} formal {{parameter}} of a function denotes pass-by-reference.|$|E
25|$|The {{function}} that takes m to Ackermann(m,m) is a <b>unary</b> total recursive {{function that}} is not primitive recursive.|$|E
25|$|The {{signature}} is that {{of fields}} (0, 1, +, −, ×) together with a <b>unary</b> function ∂, the derivation.|$|E
25|$|In some {{versions}} of BASIC, <b>unary</b> suffix & denotes a variable is of type long, or 32 bits in length.|$|E
25|$|Composition {{alone does}} not allow to {{generate}} a nullary function from the corresponding <b>unary</b> constant function, this is the technical reason why nullary functions are excluded from clones in Post's classification. If we lift the restriction, we get more clones. Namely, each clone C in Post's lattice which contains at least one constant function corresponds to two clones under the less restrictive definition: C, and C together with all nullary functions whose <b>unary</b> versions are in C.|$|E
25|$|A Boolean algebra is any {{set with}} binary {{operations}} ∧ and ∨ and a <b>unary</b> operation ¬ thereon satisfying the Boolean laws.|$|E
25|$|The {{formal logic}} that emerged {{early in the}} 20th century also requires, at minimum, <b>unary</b> {{negation}} and quantified variables ranging over some universe of discourse.|$|E
25|$|The <b>unary</b> return {{operation}} takes a value from a plain type (a) {{and puts it}} into a container using the constructor, creating a monadic value (with type Ma).|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} a {{countable}} number of independent <b>unary</b> relations is complete, {{but has no}} atomic models. It is also {{an example of a}} theory that is superstable but not totally transcendental.|$|E
25|$|Lambek (1961) took Melzak's ternary {{model and}} {{atomized}} {{it down to}} the two <b>unary</b> instructions—X+, X- if possible else jump—exactly the same two that Minsky (1961) had come up with.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory with}} a {{countable}} number of <b>unary</b> relations P'i with model the positive integers where P'i(n) is interpreted as saying n is divisible by the nth prime is superstable but not totally transcendental.|$|E
25|$|A <b>unary</b> {{operation}} always commutes with itself, {{but this}} is not necessarily the case for a binary (or higher arity) operation. A binary (or higher arity) operation that commutes with itself is called medial or entropic.|$|E
25|$|The set {{of logical}} validities in any first-order {{signature}} with equality and either: a relation symbol of arity {{no less than}} 2, or two <b>unary</b> function symbols, or one function symbol of arity no less than 2, established by Trakhtenbrot in 1953.|$|E
25|$|A sort of {{variables}} that range over sets of individuals. If S is a variable {{of this sort}} and t is a first-order term then the expression t ∈ S (also written S(t), or St to save parentheses) is an atomic formula. Sets of individuals can also be viewed as <b>unary</b> relations on the domain.|$|E
25|$|Instead {{of showing}} that the Boolean laws are satisfied, we can instead {{postulate}} a set X, two binary operations on X, and one <b>unary</b> operation, and require that those operations satisfy the laws of Boolean algebra. The elements of X need not be bit vectors or subsets but can be anything at all. This leads to the more general abstract definition.|$|E
25|$|Tally-marks: To {{keep track}} of their flocks, their sacks of grain and their money the ancients used tallying: accumulating stones or marks {{scratched}} on sticks, or making discrete symbols in clay. Through the Babylonian and Egyptian use of marks and symbols, eventually Roman numerals and the abacus evolved (Dilson, p.16–41). Tally marks appear prominently in <b>unary</b> numeral system arithmetic used in Turing machine and Post–Turing machine computations.|$|E
25|$|When {{a single}} logical {{connective}} or Boolean operator is functionally complete by itself, {{it is called}} a Sheffer function or sometimes a sole sufficient operator. There are no <b>unary</b> operators with this property. NAND and NOR , which are dual to each other, {{are the only two}} binary Sheffer functions. These were discovered, but not published, by Charles Sanders Peirce around 1880, and rediscovered independently and published by Henry M. Sheffer in 1913.|$|E
25|$|Monadic second-order logic (MSO) is a {{restriction}} of second-order logic {{in which only}} quantification over <b>unary</b> relations (i.e.: sets) are allowed. Quantification over functions, owing to the equivalence to relations as described above, is thus also not allowed. The second-order logic without these restrictions is sometimes called full second-order logic to distinguish it from the monadic version. Monadic second-order logic is particularly used {{in the context of}} Courcelle's theorem, an algorithmic meta-theorem in graph theory.|$|E
25|$|There are systems {{weaker than}} full first-order logic {{for which the}} logical {{consequence}} relation is decidable. These include propositional logic and monadic predicate logic, which is first-order logic restricted to <b>unary</b> predicate symbols and no function symbols. Other logics with no function symbols which are decidable are the guarded fragment of first-order logic, as well as two-variable logic. The Bernays–Schönfinkel class of first-order formulas is also decidable. Decidable subsets of first-order logic are also studied {{in the framework of}} description logics.|$|E
25|$|The <b>unary</b> {{notation}} can be abbreviated {{by introducing}} different symbols for certain new values. Very commonly, {{these values are}} powers of 10; so for instance, if / stands for one, − for ten and + for 100, then the number 304 can be compactly represented as +++ //// and the number 123 as + − − /// without any need for zero. This is called sign-value notation. The ancient Egyptian numeral system was of this type, and the Roman numeral system was a modification of this idea.|$|E
25|$|The class L is {{the class}} of sets whose {{construction}} is influenced by A, where A may be a (presumably non-constructible) set or a proper class. The definition of this class uses DefA (X), {{which is the same}} as Def (X) except instead of evaluating the truth of formulas Φ in the model (X,∈), one uses the model (X,∈,A) where A is a <b>unary</b> predicate. The intended interpretation of A(y) is y∈A. Then the definition of L is exactly that of L only with Def replaced by DefA.|$|E
25|$|While we {{have not}} shown the Venn {{diagrams}} for the constants 0 and 1, they are trivial, being respectively a white box and a dark box, neither one containing a circle. However we could put a circle for x in those boxes, in which case each would denote a function of one argument, x, which returns the same value independently of x, called a constant function. As far as their outputs are concerned, constants and constant functions are indistinguishable; {{the difference is that}} a constant takes no arguments, called a zeroary or nullary operation, while a constant function takes one argument, which it ignores, and is a <b>unary</b> operation.|$|E
25|$|One might {{attempt to}} reduce the second-order theory of the real numbers, with full second-order semantics, to the first-order theory in the {{following}} way. First expand the domain from the set of all real numbers to a two-sorted domain, with the second sort containing all sets of real numbers. Add a new binary predicate to the language: the membership relation. Then sentences that were second-order become first-order, with the formerly second-order quantifiers ranging over the second sort instead. This reduction can be attempted in a one-sorted theory by adding <b>unary</b> predicates that tell whether an element is a number or a set, and taking the domain to be the union of the set of real numbers and the power set of the real numbers.|$|E
25|$|Both {{universal}} algebra {{and model}} theory study classes of (structures or) algebras that {{are defined by}} a signature {{and a set of}} axioms. In the case of model theory these axioms have the form of first-order sentences. The formalism of universal algebra is much more restrictive; essentially it only allows first-order sentences that have the form of universally quantified equations between terms, e.g. xy(x+y=y+x). One consequence is that the choice of a signature is more significant in universal algebra than it is in model theory. For example, the class of groups, in the signature consisting of the binary function symbol × and the constant symbol 1, is an elementary class, {{but it is not a}} variety. Universal algebra solves this problem by adding a <b>unary</b> function symbol −1.|$|E
25|$|In {{mathematical}} logic, {{very often}} symbols {{are not allowed}} to be nullary, so that constant symbols must be treated separately rather than as nullary function symbols. They form a set Sconst disjoint from Sfunc, on which the arity function ar is not defined. However, this only serves to complicate matters, especially in proofs by induction over the structure of a formula, where an additional case must be considered. Any nullary relation symbol, which is also not allowed under such a definition, can be emulated by a <b>unary</b> relation symbol together with a sentence expressing that its value is the same for all elements. This translation fails only for empty structures (which are often excluded by convention). If nullary symbols are allowed, then every formula of propositional logic is also a formula of first-order logic.|$|E
25|$|The {{prototype}} therefore has two operations {{taking no}} arguments, called zeroary or nullary operations, namely zero and one. It has four <b>unary</b> operations, {{two of which}} are constant operations, another is the identity, and the most commonly used one, called negation, returns the opposite of its argument: 1 if 0, 0 if 1. It has sixteen binary operations; again two of these are constant, another returns its first argument, yet another returns its second, one is called conjunction and returns 1 if both arguments are 1 and otherwise 0, another is called disjunction and returns 0 if both arguments are 0 and otherwise 1, and so on. The number of (n+1)-ary operations in the prototype is the square of the number of n-ary operations, so there are 162 = 256 ternary operations, 2562 = 65,536 quaternary operations, and so on.|$|E
25|$|Now {{what is an}} atom? Conventionally an atom {{is either}} a {{constant}} (0 or 1) or a variable x'i where 0 ≤ i < n. For the proof technique here it is convenient to define atoms instead to be n-ary operations n'f'i, which although treated here as atoms nevertheless mean the same as ordinary terms of the exact form n'f'i(x0,...,x'n-1) (exact in that the variables must listed in the order shown without repetition or omission). This is not a restriction because atoms of this form include all the ordinary atoms, namely the constants 0 and 1, which arise here as the n-ary operations n'f0 and n'f−1 for each n (abbreviating 22n−1 to −1), and the variables x0,...,x'n-1 {{as can be seen}} from the truth tables where x0 appears as both the <b>unary</b> operation 1f2 and the binary operation 2f10 while x1 appears as 2f12.|$|E
25|$|Given a lattice with {{a bottom}} element 0 {{and a top}} element 1, a pair x,y of {{elements}} is called complementary when x∧y= 0 and x∨y= 1, and we then say that y is a complement of x and vice versa. Any element x of a distributive lattice with top and bottom can have at most one complement. When every element of a lattice has a complement the lattice is called complemented. It follows that in a complemented distributive lattice, the complement of an element always exists and is unique, making complement a <b>unary</b> operation. Furthermore, every complemented distributive lattice forms a Boolean algebra, and conversely every Boolean algebra forms a complemented distributive lattice. This provides an alternative definition of a Boolean algebra, namely as any complemented distributive lattice. Each of these three properties can be axiomatized with finitely many equations, whence these equations taken together constitute a finite axiomatization of the equational theory of Boolean algebras.|$|E
500|$|The sum a + b can be {{interpreted}} as a binary operation that combines a and b, in an algebraic sense, or it can {{be interpreted}} as the addition of b more units to a. Under the latter interpretation, the parts of a sum [...] play asymmetric roles, and the operation [...] is viewed as applying the <b>unary</b> operation +b to a. Instead of calling both a and b addends, it is more appropriate to call a the augend in this case, since a plays a passive role. The <b>unary</b> view is also useful when discussing subtraction, because each <b>unary</b> addition operation has an inverse <b>unary</b> subtraction operation, and vice versa.|$|E
500|$|This law {{was first}} {{identified}} in Brahmagupta's Brahmasphutasiddhanta in 628AD, although {{he wrote it}} as three separate laws, depending on whether a is negative, positive, or zero itself, and he used words rather than algebraic symbols. Later Indian mathematicians refined the concept; around the year 830, Mahavira wrote, [...] "zero becomes the same as what is added to it", corresponding to the <b>unary</b> statement [...] In the 12thcentury, Bhaskara wrote, [...] "In the addition of cipher, or subtraction of it, the quantity, positive or negative, remains the same", corresponding to the <b>unary</b> statement [...]|$|E
500|$|The Peano axioms {{can also}} be {{understood}} using category theory. Let C be a category with terminal object 1C, and define the category of pointed <b>unary</b> systems, US1(C) as follows: ...|$|E
500|$|The Peano axioms {{define the}} arithmetical {{properties}} of natural numbers, usually {{represented as a}} set N or [...] The non-logical symbols for the axioms consist of a constant symbol 0 and a <b>unary</b> function symbol S.|$|E
500|$|The SQL {{standard}} {{contains an}} extension F571 [...] "Truth value tests" [...] that introduces three additional logical <b>unary</b> operators (six in fact, if we count their negation, {{which is part}} of their syntax), also using postfix notation. They have the following truth tables: ...|$|E
500|$|Again, {{there are}} minor {{variations}} upon this definition in the literature. Taken literally, the above definition is {{an application of}} the Recursion Theorem on the partially ordered set N2. On the other hand, some sources prefer to use a restricted Recursion Theorem that applies only to the set of natural numbers. One then considers a to be temporarily [...] "fixed", applies recursion on b to define a function [...] "a+", and pastes these <b>unary</b> operations for all a together to form the full binary operation.|$|E
500|$|Fields {{can also}} be defined in different, but {{equivalent}} ways. One can alternatively define a field by four binary operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide), and their required properties. Division by zero is, by definition, excluded. In order to avoid existential quantifiers, fields can be defined by two binary operations (addition and multiplication), two <b>unary</b> operations (yielding the additive and multiplicative inverses, respectively), and two nullary operations (the constants [...] and [...] ). These operations are then subject to the conditions above. This approach avoids existential quantifiers, which is important in constructive mathematics and computing.|$|E
