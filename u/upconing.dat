In addition, overwash by tsunamis and tropical storms has corrupted lenses in the Maldives and several Pacific islands. Vertical wells can cause salt <b>upconing</b> into the lens, and overextraction will reduce freshwater pressure resulting in lateral intrusion by seawater. Because the porosity of the surface soil results in virtually zero runoff, lenses are easily polluted by fecal waste, burials, and chemical spills.

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the {{quantification}} of saltwater <b>upconing</b> below horizontal wells in freshwater lenses using analytical solutions as a computationally fast alternative to numerical simulations. Comparisons between analytical calculations and numerical simulations are presented regarding three aspects: (1) cyclic pumping; (2) dispersion; and (3) finite horizontal wells in a finite domain (a freshwater lens). Various hydrogeological conditions and pumping regimes within a dry half year are considered. The {{results show that the}} influence of elastic and phreatic storage (which are not taken into account in the analytical solutions) on the <b>upconing</b> of the interface is minimal. Furthermore, the analytical calculations based on the interface approach compare well with numerical simulations as long as the dimensionless interface <b>upconing</b> is below 1 / 3, which is in line with previous studies on steady pumping. Superimposing an analytical solution for mixing by dispersion below the well over an analytical solution based on the interface approach is appropriate in case the vertical flow velocity around the interface is nearly constant but should not be used for estimating the salinity of the pumped groundwater. The analytical calculations of interface <b>upconing</b> below a finite horizontal well compare well with the numerical simulations in case the distance between the horizontal well and the initial interface does not vary significantly along the well and in case the natural fluctuation of the freshwater lens is small. In order to maintain a low level of salinity in the well during a dry half year, the dimensionless analytically calculated interface <b>upconing</b> should stay below 0. 25. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{saltwater}} <b>upconing</b> {{caused by}} the preferential groundwater discharge of boils is a key proce ss in the salinization of Dutch deep polders. The factors controlling <b>upconing</b> by boil discharge and boil water salinities are poorly constrained and have not been previously documented. We addressed this knowl- edge gap by investigating <b>upconing</b> mechanisms using field measurements and numerical simulation s of simplified situations. Boils occur as conduits in the upper aquitard connecting the underlying aquifer {{to the surface and}} allowing groundwater to discharge at rates up to 100 m 3 d? 1 with Cl concentrations up to 5 gL? 1. Boils are found as isolated features or clustered in small areas of 20 – 100 m 2. Field observations show that preferential flow through boils creates localized and narrow saltwate r <b>upconing</b> spikes, caus- ing the elevated boil water salinities. Modeling results indicate that boil water in Dutch polders com- prises mixtures of groundwater {{from a wide range of}} depths and salinities with larger contributions from shallower and less saline groundwater than from the deeper and more saline water. Similar to pre- vious numerical studies of pumping-in duced <b>upconing,</b> the numerical results show that the most impor- tant factors controlling the boil salinity in Dutch polders are boil discharge, the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer, the depth of the transition zone and the salinit y (or density) contrast within the aquifer. When boils are clustered, natural saltwater <b>upconing</b> is a function of the total discharge of a boil cluster, whereas the boil-to-boil salinity variations within a cluster are determined by the discharge of individual boils and their position relative to neighboring boils. Regional lateral flow significantly mod- ifies flow patterns by dividing the groundwater flow system into a local boil system overlying the regio- nal flow system. Despite this, regional flow has only a minor effect on the relative contribu tions of saline and fresh groundwater to boil discharge and thus on boil salinity as well...|$|E

To fulfill this potential, gold-free growth in predetermined positions should be achieved. Ga-assisted growth of GaAs nanowires {{in the form}} of array {{has been shown to be}} challenging and difficult to reproduce. In this work, we provide some of the key elements for obtaining a high yield of GaAs nanowires on patterned Si in a reproducible way: contact angle and pinning of the Ga droplet inside the apertures achieved by the modification of the surface properties of the nanoscale areas exposed to growth. As an example, an amorphous silicon layer between the crystalline substrate and the oxide mask results in a contact angle around 90 °, leading to a high yield of vertical nanowires. Another example for tuning the contact angle is anticipated, native oxide with controlled thickness.

Fresh groundwater (FGW) samples (n = 36) are characterized by Ca 2 + > Na+ > Mg 2 + > K+ and HCO 3 − > Cl− > SO 4 2 − > NO 3 −. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient matrices, factor analysis data, values of the C-ratio (av. = 0. 89) and CAI {{and values of the}} molar ratios of Ca 2 +/HCO 3 −, Ca 2 +/SO 4 2 −, Mg 2 +/HCO 3 − and Mg 2 +/SO 4 2 − indicate that the ionic load in the FGW is derived essentially from carbonic acid-aided weathering of carbonates and aluminosilicates, saline/sea water trapped in the aquifer sediments (now admixed with the groundwater) and ion exchange reactions. Values of the CAI and Na+/Cl− molar ratio suggest that the part of the Ca 2 + (±Mg 2 +) content in 23 FGW samples is derived from clay minerals of the aquifer matrix, and part of the Na+ content in 20, 12, and 3 FGW samples is derived, respectively, from alkali feldspar weathering, clay minerals of the aquifer matrix and rain water and/or halite.

40|$|Saltwater, or brine, {{underlies}} {{fresh water}} in many aquifers, with a transition zone separating them. Pumping fresh water by wells located above the transition zone produces <b>upconing</b> of the latter, eventually salinizing the pumped water, forcing shut-off. The salinity of the pumped water {{depends on the}} pumping rate, on {{the location of the}} well's screen, on the fresh water flow regime, and on the difference in density between fresh and salt water, expressed as a dimensionless factor called density difference factor (DDF). Following the well's shut-off, the upconed saltwater mound undergoes decay, tending to return to the pre-pumping regime. In this paper, the upconing-decay processes in an axially symmetrical system are investigated to discover how they are affected by the DDF and by the dispersivities. The code FEAS-Brine, developed for the simulation of coupled density-dependent flow and salt transport, is used. In this code, the flow equation is solved by the Galer:wqkin finite element method (FEM), while the advective-dispersive salt transport equation is solved in the Eulerian-Lagrangian framework. This code does not suffer from the instability constraint on the Peclet number {{in the vicinity of the}} pumping well, where advection dominates the salt transport. Simulation results show that <b>upconing</b> is very sensitive to the DDF, which, in our work, is in the range from 0 (for ideal tracer) to 0. 2 (for brine). It is shown that for the DDF of 0. 025 (for seawater), local <b>upconing</b> occurs only for low iso-salinity surfaces, while those of high salt concentration, practically, do not shift toward the pumping well. For an ideal tracer, all iso-salinity surfaces rise toward the pumping well. For brine, however, only iso-salinity surfaces of very low salinity upcone towards the pumping well. The decay process is lengthy; it takes a long time for the upconed saltwater to migrate back to the original horizontal transition zone prior to pumping. However, the wider transition zone caused by hydrodynamic dispersion can never return to the initial one. This indicates that once a pumping well is abandoned because of high salinity, it can be reused for groundwater utilization only after a long time...|$|E

Sipadan Island, the renowned and only oceanic island in Malaysia, had experienced in the over-extraction of its groundwater {{for more than ten}} years to cater for freshwater demand associated with tourism activities. This paper discusses the output of modelling of seawater intrusion into the island’s aquifer using SEAWAT- 2000. The findings indicated that the island’s coastal aquifer has been encroached by seawater.

40|$|The Quaternary {{deposits}} {{found in}} the Alnarp valley in southwestern Sweden have had the greatest influence on chloride values in shallow groundwater. This is mostly due {{to the presence of}} high permeability sands that enable efficient groundwater extraction, which leads to <b>upconing</b> and saltwater intrusion either because the piezometric levels are near the sea level or the extraction occurs near the ocean. Highly saline fossil water has been found deep in the Scanian bedrock. The predominant hypothesis is that this fossil water was formed by a combination of sea transgression over the land during the Mesozoic era and tectonic movement, which pushed the seawater deep underground. Meanwhile bedrock with low permeability has conserved the fossil water. Weathering of the Danian limestone bedrock increases the chloride content in groundwater due to ion exchange processes. However, in this case ion exchange in the bedrock only contributes a small portion of chloride to the groundwater in comparison to fossil water. Depth is a contributing factor to high chloride concentrations found in groundwater due to the presence of fossil water, which is seldom refreshed, and therefore remains saline. The calcium:sodium ratio is much higher in the deep groundwater compared with seawater. The potassium:sodium ratio is on the other hand, much lower.

These alternatives include: 1) making withdrawls from the Upper Floridan aquifer, only 2) optimizing pumping schedules, 3) controlling vertical migration of the plume by manipulating aquifer pressures, and 4) selective pumping in areas outside the plume to control horizontal migration.

40|$|C. E. Jacob {{received}} patents in 1965 for {{a single}} location well doublet that would produce fresh water overlying salt-water without <b>upconing</b> of the heavier salt-water and pollution of the fresh water zone. No known evaluation of the concept or development of design criteria has been accomplished. In this study, a finite difference radial flow model was developed to determine groundwater velocities and salt concentration {{as a function of}} time and space. This model was verified and is available for evaluating design criteria for Jacob's single location well doublet. Initial runs with the model indicate that the concept has potential, particularly in aquifers with clay lenses in the salt-water zone. Additional runs with the model will be needed to fully establish the design criteria necessary for Jacob's single location well doublet...|$|E
30|$|The {{mining lease}} area of Surka [District Bhavnagar, Gujarat (India)] is located within 6 – 12 km {{horizontal}} distance of sea shore of Gulf of Cambay. Whenever, {{there will be}} onset of lignite extraction, there will be always a threat of sea water intrusion into the mining lease area due to its close proximity to seashore. This article describes the prediction of sea water intrusion into the lease area of whole mining block using Ghyben-Herzberg relation between fresh and saline water, Remote Sensing, Ground Truth verification, Electrical Resistivity Survey and groundwater table monitored during the year 2004. As per the Ghyben-Herzberg relation, results show that {{there will not be}} sea water intrusion. If there is excess pumping of water then also the basement rock below the lignite seam will put hindrance to any possible <b>upconing</b> of saline water interface.|$|E
40|$|Many {{coastal regions}} in the world {{experience}} an intensive salt water intrusion in aquifers due to natural and anthropogenic causes. The salinisation of these groundwater systems {{can lead to a}} severe deterioration of the quality of existing fresh groundwater resources. In this paper, the characteristics of variable-density groundwater flow and the concept of an interface between fresh and saline groundwater are introduced. Problems associated with these groundwater resources are discussed, such as <b>upconing</b> of saline groundwater caused by excessive overpumping and salt water intrusion caused by global mean sea level rise. Possible human activities to compensate and control the salinisation of coastal aquifers are presented. Most countermeasures appear to be expensive, laborious and should be taken in time. Finally, the effect of lowering piezometric heads on the salinisation of the subsoil is illustrated in a Dutch aquifer system...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{numerical}} {{model for the}} axisymmetric subsurface flow during steady air venting and/or sparging from underground wells along the same vertical axis is presented. A common observation that for steady air injection or extraction, motion of the groundwater is negligible is first justified theoretically. Thus in the two-phase problem, only air is moving, while water remains stationary. Nevertheless there can be significant changes in water saturation because the capillary pressure varies nonlinearly with the air saturation. For pure air venting, the effects of <b>upconing</b> of the water table are studied. For pure air sparging, the role of air compressibility ignored by earlier authors is reassessed, and issues of design interest such as the radius of influence and discharge rates are examined. Comparisons with published measurements are discussed. Physical implications of concurrent venting and sparging are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Formation of a freshwater-sea water {{transition}} zone in a basal aquifer under pumping stresses was studied by sand-box experiments and by comparing experimental data with results from other theoretical and field investigations. <b>Upconing</b> height for different pumping rates and well penetration depths were {{measured in the}} laboratory. These experimental data were then compared with theoretical values computed {{with or without the}} sharp interface assumption. Dispersivity of laboratory sand was determined by matching the observed thickness of the {{transition zone}} with the theoretical value. The thickness of the transition zone was found to increase as the pumping rate and/or the partial well penetration depth increased. The results of the laboratory experiments were compatible with the values predicted by theoretical equations. Office of Water Policy, U. S.
