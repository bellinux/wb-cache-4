5000|$|At {{the end of}} Dextre's {{arms are}} ORU/Tool Changeout Mechanisms (OTCM). The OTCM has {{built-in}} grasping jaws, a retractable socket drive, a monochrome TV camera, lights, and an <b>umbilical</b> <b>connector</b> that can provide power, data, and video to/from a payload.|$|E
50|$|The Gemini 10 device used by Michael Collins {{received}} its nitrogen gas propellant {{from inside the}} spacecraft, through a hose bundled with the astronaut's <b>umbilical</b> <b>connector.</b> Collins successfully used it to {{move back and forth}} between the Gemini and the Agena Target Vehicle.|$|E
50|$|DubaiSat-1 has a {{hexagonal}} {{body with}} three deployable solar panels. The frame includes spacecraft adaptors, six longerons, , an inner ring that provides rigidity {{and stability of}} the satellite's camera, inner rods and three decks. Three spacecraft adaptors connect with shear brackets and mechanically couple the satellite and separation adaptor of the launch vehicle, the Dnepr Rocket. Each one of the spacecraft adaptors has separation sensors to monitor the separation condition between the satellite and the launch vehicle. The <b>umbilical</b> <b>connector</b> attaches on the lower surface of the bottom deck with its mounting support bracket.|$|E

The tips {{of some of}} {{the rockets}} are white (and the rockets are shorter in length, and they are attached to the launcher via <b>umbilical</b> <b>connectors)</b> because they have a different type of warhead and fuze.|$|R
50|$|In the 1950s, Cannon {{developed}} the D-subminiature connector for the military/aerospace market, {{and the company}} became an international supplier of connectors and interconnection systems with <b>umbilical</b> <b>connectors</b> {{designed to meet the}} specialized needs of guided missiles ranging from small rockets to multistage vehicles. To date, ITT Interconnect Solutions’ (ICS) connectors have been used on every free world space mission.|$|R
50|$|The rocket was {{provided}} with ejecting <b>umbilical</b> <b>connectors,</b> although their precise deployment evolved. Initially these 'Stotz plugs' travelled as Meillerwagen accessories, stowed on the lifting frame {{along with their}} cables. Later, the Stotz plugs were stowed in the cable box, and a ten metre cable mast was stowed on the lifting frame for ultimate erection on the launch table at the launch site.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{no obvious}} {{reason for the}} {{malfunction}} {{could be found in}} the cameras themselves, investigation next shifted to the electrical umbilical on the payload fairing. This <b>umbilical</b> <b>connector</b> would normally be attached on the ground to permit testing of the Ranger's subsystems and only a thin hinged door covered it during launch. One of the pins on the connector was [...] "hot" [...] and could easily be bridged, transferring a voltage to the adjacent pins and activating the TV camera system during launch. As for the cause of it, one possibility was electrostatic discharge, the other was a shock wave of some sort.|$|E
50|$|Shortly after Ranger 6's mission concluded, {{a review}} board was convened {{to resolve the}} cause of the TV camera failure. This was {{determined}} quickly; the inadvertent activation of the camera telemetry system during ascent had been caused by an electrical short that crippled the power supply for the cameras. But why it had happened was as yet a mystery, especially as telemetry data sent back from the probe could only provide a limited amount of information. On February 14, 1964, JPL released a report noting that an internal command switch could have activated prematurely or that arcing had occurred in the <b>umbilical</b> <b>connector</b> on the payload fairing. However, {{there was no evidence of}} the latter happening or any obvious way that it could occur and several modifications were proposed to the camera system and/or the payload fairing.|$|E
40|$|In technique, voice {{circuits}} connecting crew's cabin {{to launch}} station through <b>umbilical</b> <b>connector</b> disconnect automatically unused, or deadened portion of circuits immediately after vehicle is launched, eliminating possibility that unused wiring interferes with voice communications inside vehicle or need for manual cutoff switch {{and its associated}} wiring. Technique is applied to other types of electrical actuation circuits, also launch of mapped vehicles, such as balloons, submarines, test sleds, and test chambers-all requiring assistance of ground crew...|$|E

40|$|The Flight Support System (FSS) which {{contains}} twelve mechanisms (six different types) {{which are used}} for retention and positioning of a Multimission Modular Spacecraft (MMS) within the Space Shuttle's cargo bay during launch, retrieval, and servicing missions is described. Retention latches were designed to provide the capability for structural support of the MMS during launch and retrieval, and during servicing operations the mechanisms on the Positioning Platform provide the capability for positioning the MMS in virtually any orientation necessary for the work to be performed. In addition, there are mechanisms for matching and demating <b>umbilical</b> <b>connectors</b> and a mechanism for locking the Positioning Platform during maneuvers. Each Mechanism is driven by a Common Drive Unit. Manual overrides were provided for those mechanisms that would present a safety hazard for the crew, if they should fail...|$|R
40|$|Referred {{to as the}} "lifeline for any space launch vehicle" by NASA Space Launch Initiative Program Manager Warren Wiley, an {{umbilical}} is a {{large device}} that transports power, communications, instrument readings, and fluids such as propellants, pressurization gases, and coolants from one source to another. Numerous launch vehicles, planetary systems, and rovers require umbilical "mating". This process is a driving factor for dependable and affordable space access. With future-generation space vehicles in mind, NASA recently designed a smart, automated method for quickly and reliably mating and demating electrical and fluid <b>umbilical</b> <b>connectors.</b> The new <b>umbilical</b> concept is expected to replace NASA s traditional umbilical systems that release at vehicle lift-off (T- 0). The idea is to increase safety by automatically performing hazardous tasks, thus reducing potential failure modes and the time and labor hours necessary to prepare for launch. The new system will {{also be used as}} a test bed for quick disconnect development and for advance control and leak detection. It incorporates concepts such as a secondary mate plate, robotic machine vision, and compliant motor motion control, and is destined to advance usage of automated umbilicals in a variety of aerospace and commercial applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} a {{comprehensive}} study which defined an Extravehicular Life Support System Thermal Control System (TCS) are presented. The design of the prototype hardware and a detail summary of the prototype TCS fabrication and test effort are given. Several heat rejection subsystems, water management subsystems, humidity control subsystems, pressure control schemes and temperature control schemes were evaluated. Alternative integrated TCS systems were studied, and an optimum system was selected based on quantitative weighing of weight, volume, cost, complexity and other factors. The selected subsystem contains a sublimator for heat rejection, bubble expansion tank for water management, a slurper and rotary separator for humidity control, and a pump, a temperature control valve, a gas separator and a vehicle <b>umbilical</b> <b>connector</b> for water transport. The prototype hardware complied with program objectives...|$|E
40|$|Four space projects' {{activities}} are summarized. Design {{work on the}} Mars Penetrator Project, {{in cooperation with the}} NASA Ames Research Center, is being continued. Efforts are focused on the drilling mechanism which must penetrate the martian subsurface soil to collect and retrieve an uncontaminated sample. The new design consists of a rotary-percussive drill mechanism. This mechanism is optimum for dry drilling, necessary to avoid contamination of the soil sample, in many different soil types. The need for a small, relatively inexpensive device to study the chemical structure of this martian soil was also established. The egg design was chosen for its low cost compared to other systems and potential for a large number of eggs to be deployed on the martian surface. The design process included analysis of the dynamics of reentry, dissipation of heat during reentry, impact with the surface, access to undisturbed soil samples, and ability to gather samples from the soil at three depths. The egg consists of the reentry systems, soil probe lifting system, soil probe package, gas chromatograph, transmitter, and battery power supply. The egg must function only once, but is designed to withstand one martian year. The Mars Mole is designed as a rover-based device which penetrates the martian soil to a depth of up to 10 m, obtains a sample of soil, and returns it to the surface for analysis. The mole was designed to meet the following specifications: (1) weight less than 10 kg; (2) size less than 20 x 20 x 30 cm; (3) power less than 100 W; (4) ability to obtain a sample of at least 5 cc; (5) ability to penetrate fine, loose sand; and (6) need to obtain at least one sample. The space station <b>umbilical</b> <b>connector</b> project is a device which provides the translational motion of the connectors on the Space Station Freedom to allow engagement for power and data transfer. The design is capable of delivering a 20 lb force within the necessary tolerances and will operate reliably in the space environment...|$|E
40|$|An amine-based {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) and water vapor sorbent in pressure-swing regenerable beds has been {{developed}} by Hamilton Sundstrand and baselined for the Orion Atmosphere Revitalization System (ARS). In three previous years at this conference, reports were presented on extensive Johnson Space Center (JSC) testing of this technology. That testing was performed in a sea-level pressure environment with both simulated and real human metabolic loads, and in both open and closed-loop configurations. The Orion ARS is designed to also support space-suited operations in a depressurized cabin, so {{the next step in}} developmental testing at JSC was to test the ARS technology in a typical closed space suit-loop environment with low-pressure oxygen inside the process loop and vacuum outside the loop. This was the first instance of low-pressure, high-oxygen, closed-loop testing of the Orion ARS technology, and it was conducted with simulated human metabolic loads in March 2009. The test investigated pressure drops and flow balancing through two different styles of prototype suit <b>umbilical</b> <b>connectors.</b> General swing-bed performance was tested with both umbilical configurations, as well as with a short jumper line installed in place of the umbilicals. Other interesting results include observations on the thermal effects of swing-bed operation in a vacuum environment and a recommendation of cycle time to maintain acceptable suit atmospheric CO 2 and moisture levels...|$|R

In two previous years at this conference, reports were presented on extensive Johnson Space Center (JSC) testing of this technology in a sea-level pressure environment with simulated human metabolic loads. Another paper at this year s conference discusses similar testing with real human metabolic loads, including some closed-loop testing with emergency breathing masks. The Orion ARS is designed to also support extravehicular activity operations from a depressurized cabin. The next step in developmental testing at JSC was, therefore, to test this ARS technology in a typical closed space suit loop environment with low-pressure pure oxygen inside the process loop and vacuum outside the loop. This was the first instance of low-pressure oxygen loop testing of a new Orion ARS technology, and was conducted with simulated human metabolic loads in December 2008.

40|$|Performance of the Tethered Satellite System (TSS) Deployer {{during the}} STS- 46 mission (July and August 1992) is {{analyzed}} {{in terms of}} hardware operation at the component and system level. Although only a limited deployment of the satellite was achieved (256 meters vs 20 kilometers planned), the mission served to verify the basic capability of the Deployer to release, control and retrieve a tethered satellite. - Deployer operational flexibility that was demonstrated during the flight is also addressed. Martin Marietta was the prime contractor {{for the development of}} the Deployer, under management of the NASA George C. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). The satellite was provided by Alenia, Torino, Italy under contract to the Agencia Spaziale Italiana (ASI). Proper operation of the avionics components and the majority of mechanisms was observed during the flight. System operations driven by control laws for the deployment and retrieval of the satellite were also successful for the limited deployment distance. Anomalies included separation problems for one of the two <b>umbilical</b> <b>connectors</b> between the Deployer and satellite, tether jamming (at initial Satellite fly-away and at a deployment distance of 224 meters), and a mechanical interference which prevented tether deployment beyond 256 meters. The Deployer was used in several off-nominal conditions to respond to these anomalies, which ultimately enabled a successful satellite retrieval and preservation of hardware integrity for a future re-flight. The paper begins with an introduction defining the significance of the TSS- 1 mission. The body of the paper is divided into four major sections: (1) Description of Deployer System and Components, (2) Deployer Components/Systems Demonstrating Successful Operation, (3) Hardware Anomalies and Operational Responses, and (4) Design Modifications for the TSS- 1 R Re-flight Mission. Conclusions from the TSS- 1 mission, including lessons learned are presented at the end of the manuscript...|$|R
5000|$|MIL-DTL-83538, (formerly MIL-C-83538) {{describes}} connectors and accessories, electrical, circular, <b>umbilical.</b> The <b>connector</b> assembly {{provides the}} necessary connections {{required to meet}} a MIL-STD-1760, Class I electrical interface between stores and their associated launchers using a [...] "blind mating" [...] mechanism. The connector assembly consists of a receptacle installed on the launcher, a receptacle installed on the store, and a buffer plug installed between the two receptacles. This specification also includes the required mounting adapters and nut, accessory adapter, cable bushing, and protective covers. This connector assembly provides the transfer of MIL-STD-1760 interface class I electrical signals and power between an aircraft (or ground vehicle) mounted launcher and an associated store. This connector is military unique because {{it is intended to}} be used on rail and eject launchers where engagement/disengagement of the launcher receptacle (with attached buffer plug) to the store receptacle will be via a blindmate mechanical mechanism; whereas no known commercially equivalent substitute is available. The insert arrangement is 25-20 of MIL-STD-1560.|$|R
5000|$|Hughes {{developed}} a TOW missile with a wireless data link in 1989, {{referred to as}} TOW-2N, but this weapon was not adopted {{for use by the}} U.S. military. Raytheon continued to develop improvements to the TOW line, but its FOTT (Follow-On To TOW) program was canceled in 1998, and its TOW-FF (TOW-Fire and Forget) program was cut short on 30 November 2001 because of funding limitations. In 2001 and 2002, Raytheon and the U.S. Army worked together on an extended range TOW 2B variant, initially referred to as TOW-2B (ER), but now called TOW-2B Aero which has a special nose cap that increases range to 4.5 km. Although this missile has been in production since 2004, no U.S. Army designation has yet been assigned. Wireless versions of the TOW-2A, TOW-2B and TOW-2B Aero have been developed that uses a [...] "stealthy" [...] one way radio link, identified with the suffix [...] "RF." [...] These missiles require no special alterations to the launcher, since the RF transmitter is encased along with the missile and uses the standard <b>umbilical</b> data <b>connector.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{cable reel}} {{assembly}} is described which is particularly adapted for, {{but not limited}} to, a system for providing electrical connection of power and data signals between an orbiter vehicle, such as a space shuttle, and a recovered satellite. The assembly is comprised of two mutually opposing ring type structures having 180 deg relative rotation {{with one of the}} structures being held in fixed position while the other structure is rotatable. Motor controlled berthing latches and <b>umbilical</b> cable <b>connectors</b> for the satellite are located {{on the rim of the}} rotatable ring structure. The electrical cable assembly is fed in two sections from the orbiter vehicle into the outer rim portion of the fixed ring structure where they are directed inwardly and attached to two concentrically coiled metal bands whose respective ends are secured to inner and outer post members of circular sets of guide pins located on opposing circular plate members, one rotatable and one fixed. The cable sections are fed out as three output cable sections through openings in the central portion of the circular plate of the rotatable ring structure where they are directed to the latches and connectors located on its rim...|$|R
5000|$|A thick [...] "umbilical" [...] cable {{connects the}} base unit {{to the head}} unit, {{supplying}} both power, and communications for the subwoofer. The umbilical connects via a multi-pin connector, which is a possible cause of the TAM's one major fault - the [...] "speaker buzz". Inspections of units that received a repair by Apple due to the speaker buzz found an extra resistor/s had been installed in the <b>umbilical.</b> Ensuring the <b>connectors</b> are free of dust/dirt has also been known to resolve the [...] "buzz", though the buzz ultimately only affected {{a small percentage of}} machines. An Apple Engineer noted that the thick umbilical was intended to power a higher end CPU, however that option was ultimately curtailed, though the diameter of the umbilical remained.|$|R
40|$|An {{umbilical}} {{system design}} is described that incorporates all the features specified for a power system to payload interconnect capability. A proof-of-concept {{prototype of the}} umbilical system was built to determine experimentally the suitability of the threading characteristics of the ram mechanism and to verify freedom from cross threading. It is concluded that Berthing systems that utilize remote manipulator systems (RMS) can be simplified by using RMS targets, closed circuit TV cameras, tie into the RMS control system, and grapple-fixture and end-effector-like capture and secure mechanisms. To effect a remotely controlled umbilical interconnect in proximity with a manned spacecraft and to provide for extravehicular activity backup and maintenance capabilities, 18 different mechanisms {{are found to be}} necessary. The weight impact of proving for maintenance capability in a large multiple <b>connector</b> <b>umbilical</b> system was found to be in the order of + 60 percent...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this project}} are to develop connectors (quick disconnects and umbilical systems) that can be repetitively and reliably mated and de-mated during Lunar surface extra-vehicular activities. These standardized interfaces will be required for structural integrity and commodities transfer between linked surface elements. QD's fittings are needed for EVA spacesuit Primary Life Support Systems as well as liquid cooled garment circulation and suit heat rejection. <b>Umbilical</b> electro-mechanical systems (<b>connectors)</b> are needed between discrete surface systems for transfer of air, power, fluid (water), and data must be capable of being operated by extra vehicular astronaut crew members and/or robotic assistants. There exists an urgent need to prevent electro-statically charged dust and debris from clogging and degrading the interface seals and causing leakage and spills of hazardous commodities, contaminating the flowstream, and degrading the mechanisms needed for umbilical connection. Other challenges include modularity, standardization, autonomous operation, and lifetime sealing issues...|$|R
40|$|An animal {{exposure}} test {{system has been}} designed and fabricated {{for the purpose of}} collecting physiological and environmental (temperature) data from animal subjects exposed to combustion gases in large scale fire tests. The AETS consists of an open wire mesh, two-compartment cage, one containing an exercise wheel for small rodents, and the other containing one rat instrumented externally for electrocardiogram and respiration. The ECG and respiration sensors are located in a belt placed around the torso of the subject, electrode wires forming an <b>umbilical</b> to a <b>connector</b> {{in the top of the}} compartment. A cable extends from the connector to the power supply and signal conditioning electronics. These are connected to a dual-beam oscilloscope for real time monitoring and a magnetic tape recorder having three or more channels. Endpoints observed are bradycardia, cardiac arrhythmias, changes in respiratory pattern, respiratory arrest and cardiac arrest. The ECG record also appears to be a good method of monitoring animal activity as indicated by an increase in EMG noise superimposed on the record during increased activity of the torso musculature. Examples of the recordings are presented and discussed as to their significance regarding toxicity of fire gases...|$|R
50|$|Two 6.5 hour spacewalks were {{conducted}} by three astronauts to test hardware and tools {{to be used in}} the assembly of the International Space Station starting in late 1998. EVA-1 on flight day five consisted of Crewmembers Leroy Chiao (EV1) and Dan Barry (EV2). After taking a few minutes to acclimate themselves in the payload bay, first-time spacewalkers Chiao and Barry attached a portable work platform to the end of the robot arm, operated by Pilot Brent Jett and Mission Specialist Koichi Wakata. Jett used the arm to grapple various pieces of hardware designed to hold large modular components, mimicking the way equipment boxes and avionics gear will be moved back and forth in assembling the Space Station. Chiao and Barry unfolded a cable tray diagonally across the forward portion of the cargo bay housing simulated electrical and fluid lines similar to those which would later connect modules and nodes of the Space Station. The rigid umbilical, as it is known, was tested for its ease of handling and the ability of the astronauts to hook up the lines to connectors on the side of Endeavour's bay. While Chiao unraveled various lengths of cable from a caddy device, Barry spent time practicing the hookup of the various cables in the rigid <b>umbilical</b> to <b>connectors</b> in the bay, testing his ability to manipulate tiny bolts and screws in weightlessness. He reported that most tasks could be accomplished with little difficulty. Barry and Chiao then traded places, as Barry mounted the portable work platform to evaluate its worth. The first EVA lasted 6 hours, 9 minutes. EVA-2 on Flight Day 7 consisted of Leroy Chiao (EV1) and Winston Scott (EV2), lasting 6 hours, 53 minutes. Chiao and Scott worked with utility boxes, slidewires and a portable work stanchion affixed to Endeavour's robot arm to gather additional data on methods and procedures which would be incorporated in the techniques used to assemble the International Space Station. Late in the spacewalk, Scott climbed into foot restraints on the OAST-Flyer satellite platform for a thermal evaluation exercise. Endeavour was maneuvered to the coldest position possible, with its payload bay facing out toward deep space and allowing temperatures to dip to about 104 degrees below zero at the point where Scott was positioned to test the ability of his spacesuit to repel the bitter cold temperature of space.|$|R
