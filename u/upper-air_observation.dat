40|$|Oceanic {{emissions}} of halogenated very short-lived substances (VSLS) {{are expected to}} contribute significantly to the stratospheric halogen loading and therefore to ozone depletion. The amount of VSLS transported into the stratosphere is estimated based on in-situ observations around the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) and on modeling studies which mostly use prescribed global emission scenarios to reproduce observed atmospheric concentrations. In addition to upper-air VSLS measurements, direct observations of oceanic VSLS emissions are available along ship cruise tracks. Here we use such in-situ observations of VSLS emissions from the West Pacific and tropical Atlantic together with an atmospheric Lagrangian transport model to estimate the direct contribution of bromoform (CHBr 3), and dibromomethane (CH 2 Br 2) to the stratospheric bromine loading {{as well as their}} ozone depletion potential. Our emission-based estimates of VSLS profiles are compared to <b>upper-air</b> <b>observations</b> and thus link observed oceanic emissions and in situ TTL measurements. This comparison determines how VSLS emissions and transport in the cruise track regions contribute to global upper-air VSLS estimates. The West Pacific emission-based profiles and the global <b>upper-air</b> <b>observations</b> of CHBr 3 show a relatively good agreement indicating that emissions from the West Pacific provide an average contribution to the global CHBr 3 budget. The tropical Atlantic, although also being a CHBr 3 source region, is of less importance for global upper-air CHBr 3 estimates as revealed by the small emission-based abundances in the TTL. Western Pacific CH 2 Br 2 emission-based estimates are considerably smaller than <b>upper-air</b> <b>observations</b> {{as a result of the}} relatively low sea-to-air flux found in the West Pacific. Together, CHBr 3 and CH 2 Br 2 emissions from the West Pacific are projected to contribute to the stratospheric bromine budget with 0. 4 pptv Br on average and 2. 3 pptv Br for cases of maximum emissions through product and source gas injection. These relatively low estimates reveal that the tropical West Pacific, although characterized by strong convective transport, might overall contribute less VSLS to the stratospheric bromine budget than other regions as a result of only low CH 2 Br 2 and moderate CHBr 3 oceanic emissions...|$|R

We also find that when large-scale advection and subsidence are included in the simulation, the values for turbulent kinetic energy are lower than without these large-scale forcings.

Upper-and low-level circulation fields were derived for seasonal means and SALLJ composites during the warm and cold seasons. The Bonner criterion 1 was applied for sites in central Bolivia and downstream near northern Paraguay, to determine the spatial and temporal characteristics of the SALLJ. On the circulation characteristics, SALLJ composites during the warm season show the enhanced low-level meridional moisture transport coming from equatorial South America {{as well as an}} upper-level wave train emanating from the west Pacific propagating toward South America. The intensification of the warm season SALLJ follows the establishment of an upper-level ridge over southern Brazil and a trough over most of Argentina. The circulation anomalies at upper and lower levels suggest that the intensification of the SALLJ would lead to an intensification of the South Atlantic convergence zone (SACZ) later on and to the penetration of cold fronts with an area of enhanced convection ahead at the exit region of the SALLJ. Regarding the time variability, the SALLJ seems to occur all year long, bringing tropical moist air masses from the Amazon into southern Brazil-northern Argentina more frequently in the warm season, and bringing tropical maritime air, which is less humid than the tropical air masses coming from the subtropical Atlantic high, more frequently during the cold season. SALLJs are detected mostly during the warm season to the north of similar to 20 degreesS, while to the south the SALLJs seem to occur all year long. The diurnal cycle shows that SALLJs are more frequent and intense between 0600 and 1200 UTC for the warm season north of 20 degreesS, while at the region downstream the maximum is detected between 0000 and 0600 UTC during the cold season. At interannual time scales, even though there is a weak tendency for stronger and more frequent warm season SALLJ episodes in years with anomalously warm surface waters in the tropical Pacific, it cannot be affirmed with a large degree of certainty that there is a strong relationship between the occurrence of El Nino events and the number and/or intensity of SALLJ episodes.

The observations show systematic association between the composite moisture, temperature, and wind differences. Studies of longwave sensitivity using a two stream model show that the moisture field dominates the longwave radiative cooling; hence, dry midlevels enhance cooling of the atmosphere.

The initial state of the atmosphere was analyzed from synoptic surface and <b>upper-air</b> <b>observations</b> in the eastern United States. The computations were made for a finite difference grid with 1200 grid points, using a 15 -min. time step. The vertical coordinate was defined by 12 grid points over each of 100 grid points in the horizontal plane. The average spacing of the horizontal grid points was 160 km. The separation of the vertical grid points expanded from 50 m. near the ground to 450 m. at the uppermost level. The model boundary layer was subdivided into a 50 -m. deep, surface contact layer and a 1950 -m. deep, transition layer. Stability-dependent, constant-flux profile formulas were applied within the surface contact layer. These were used in conjunction with semi-empirical formulas to derive boundary conditions applicable {{at the base of the}} transition layer. Observed data were used to prescribe the horizontal pressure gradient force at the upper boundar...|$|R
40|$|A {{sounding}} climatology of {{a variety}} of parameters commonly used to forecast deep, moist convection using <b>upper-air</b> <b>observations</b> is developed. The data set includes 0000 and 1200 UTC rawinsonde data (approximately 3629 soundings) from Laughlin AFB, TX from April-September 1995 - 2004. Cloud-to-ground lightning data, surface observations and severe weather reports from the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) SeverePlot 2 Program were used to categorize soundings as representative of conditions for no convection, light convection, convection within vicinity, moderate severe convection, or severe convection. Indices, including convective available potential energy (CAPE) and mean layer CAPE (MLCAPE), along with sounding parameters and combinations of such as 0 - 2 and 0 - 6 km bulk shear, 700 - 500 mb lapse rate, lifted condensation level (LCL) and mean layer LCL (MLLCL) heights, are examined in an attempt to distinguish between moderate and severe convection. The results show that the 0 - 6 km bulk shear along with the MLCAPE and LCL height indicate some discrimination between the moderate and severe categories. The best discrimination comes from the significant severe parameter (defined by calculating the product of the 0 - 6 km bulk shear and MLCAPE), and the 0 - 6 km bulk shear versus the MLCAPE, and the 700 - 500 mb lapse rate.

40|$|The RS 2 - 91 {{rawinsonde}} system {{replaced the}} RS 2 - 80 rawinsonde system on January 1, 1995 for <b>upper-air</b> <b>observations</b> at Syowa Station, Antarctica. In {{order to determine}} the properties of RS 2 - 91 and RS 2 - 80,a total of 45 flights were carried out with the two types of link radiosondes at Syowa Station, from December 1994 to September 1995. The RS 2 - 80 rawinsonde consists of a rod thermistor painted in white, a carbon hygristor and a baroswitch aneroid capsule for measuring temperature, humidity and pressure, respectively. The RS 2 - 91 rawinsonde consists of a rod thermistor coated with vacuum-evaporated aluminum, a thin capacitor film and a capacitive aneroid capsule, respectively. The solar radiation correction is applied for air temperature measurements with both the RS 2 - 91 and RS 2 - 80. The differences of temperatures measured at standard pressure levels were within approximately ± 1. 5 ℃ in the stratosphere during this period. The characteristic tendencies are as follows. In the stratosphere in the daytime, the temperatures measured by RS 2 - 91 were lower than those measured by RS 2 - 80 in the winter, under low temperature conditions (below - 80 ℃). In the fall (approximately - 50 ℃), however, those measured by RS 2 - 91 were higher than those measured by RS 2 - 80...|$|R
