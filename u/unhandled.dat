25|$|Post-mortem {{debugging}} is debugging of {{the program}} after it has already crashed. Related techniques often include various tracing techniques (for example,) and/or analysis of memory dump (or core dump) of the crashed process. The dump of the process could be obtained automatically by the system (for example, when process has terminated due to an <b>unhandled</b> exception), or by a programmer-inserted instruction, or manually by the interactive user.|$|E
25|$|The special {{values such as}} {{infinity}} and NaN {{ensure that}} the floating-point arithmetic is algebraically completed, such that every floating-point operation produces a well-defined result and will not—by default—throw a machine interrupt or trap. Moreover, the choices of special values returned in exceptional cases were designed to give the correct answer in many cases, e.g. continued fractions such as R(z) := 7 − 3/(z − 2 − 1/(z − 7 + 10/(z − 2 − 2/(z − 3)))) will give the correct answer in all inputs under IEEE-754 arithmetic as the potential divide by zero in e.g. R(3)=4.6 is correctly handled as +infinity and so can be safely ignored. As noted by Kahan, the <b>unhandled</b> trap consecutive to a floating-point to 16-bit integer conversion overflow that caused the loss of an Ariane 5 rocket {{would not have happened}} under the default IEEE 754 floating-point policy.|$|E
25|$|Windows {{specific}} compiler {{support is}} also needed for Structured Exception Handling (SEH). This system serves two purposes: {{it provides a}} substrate on which language-specific exception handling can be implemented, and it is how the kernel notifies applications of exceptional conditions such as dereferencing an invalid pointer or stack overflow. The Microsoft/Borland C++ compilers {{had the ability to}} use this system {{as soon as it was}} introduced in Windows 95 and NT, however the actual implementation was undocumented and had to be reverse engineered for the Wine project and free compilers. SEH is based on pushing exception handler frames onto the stack, then adding them to a linked list stored in thread local storage (the first field of the thread environment block). When an exception is thrown, the kernel and base libraries unwind the stack running handlers and filters as they are encountered. Eventually, every exception <b>unhandled</b> by the application will be dealt with by the default backstop handler, which pops up the Windows common crash dialog.|$|E

[...] The only exception to this rule is where dead game may be used in the conduct of a water test at a field trial. [...] The reason this exception exists it to acknowledge the fact that game will not necessarily be shot over water, although for dogs to qualify for titles in field trials will be required to demonstrate their ability to retrieve from water.|$|E
60|$|Is {{it out of}} the {{question}} that we should entertain some scruple about mixing our own flavour, as of the too cheap and insistent nutmeg, with that of every great writer and every great subject?--especially when our flavour is all we have to give, the matter or knowledge having been already given by somebody else. What if we were only like the Spanish wine-skins which impress the innocent stranger with the notion that the Spanish grape has naturally a taste of leather? One could wish that even the greatest minds should leave some themes <b>unhandled,</b> or at least leave us no more than a paragraph or two on them to show how well they did in not being more lengthy.|$|E
6000|$|This {{portrait}} is {{from the}} pen of friendship; yet, if we consider all the circumstances of Dryden's life, we cannot deem it much exaggerated. For about forty years, his character, personal and literary, was the object of assault by every subaltern scribbler, titled or untitled, laureated or pilloried. [...] "My morals," [...] he himself has said, [...] "have been sufficiently aspersed; that only sort of reputation, which ought to be dear to every honest man, and is to me." [...] In such an assault, no weapon would remain <b>unhandled,</b> no charge, true or false, unurged; and what qualities we do not there find excepted against, must surely be admitted to pass to the credit of Dryden. His change of political opinion, {{from the time he}} entered life under the protection of a favourite of Cromwell, might have argued instability, if he had changed a second time, when the current of power and popular opinion set against the doctrines of the Reformation. As it is, we must hold Dryden to have acted from conviction, since personal interest, had that been the ruling motive of his political conduct, would have operated as strongly in 1688 as in 1660. The change of his religion we have elsewhere discussed; and endeavoured to show that, although Dryden was unfortunate in adopting the more corrupted form of our religion, yet, considered relatively, it was a fortunate and laudable conviction which led him from the mazes of scepticism to become a catholic of the communion of Rome.[57] It would be vain to maintain, that in his early career he was free from the follies and vices of a dissolute period; but the absence of every positive charge, and the silence of numerous accusers, may be admitted to prove, that he partook in them more from general example than inclination, and with a moderate, rather than voracious or undistinguishing appetite. It must be admitted, that he sacrificed to the Belial or Asmodeus of the age, in his writings; and that he formed his taste upon the licentious and gay society with which he mingled. But we have the testimony of one who knew him well, that, however loose his comedies, the temper of the author was modest;[58] his indelicacy was like the forced impudence of a bashful man; and Rochester has accordingly upbraided him, that his licentiousness was neither natural nor seductive. Dryden had unfortunately conformed enough to the taste of his age, to attempt that [...] "nice mode of wit," [...] as it is termed by the said noble author, whose name has become inseparably connected with it; but it sate awkwardly upon his natural modesty, and in general sounds impertinent, as well as disgusting. The clumsy phraseology of Burnet, in passing censure on the immorality of the stage, after the Restoration, terms [...] "Dryden, the greatest master of dramatic poesy, a monster of immodesty and of impurity of all sorts." [...] The expression called forth the animated defence of Granville, Lord Lansdowne, our author's noble friend. [...] "All who knew him," [...] said Lansdowne, [...] "can testify this was not his character. He was so much a stranger to immodesty, that modesty in too great a degree was his failing: he hurt his fortune by it, he complained of it, and never could overcome it. He was," [...] adds he, [...] "esteemed, courted, and admired, by all the great men of the age in which he lived, who would certainly not have received into friendship a monster abandoned to all sorts of vice and impurity. His writings will do immortal honour to his name and country, and his poems last as long, if I may have leave to say it, as the Bishop's sermons, supposing them to be equally excellent in their kind."[59] ...|$|E

5000|$|When {{a program}} error occurs in Windows, the system {{searches}} {{for a program}} error handler. A program error handler deals with errors as they arise during the running of a program. If the system does not find a program error handler, the system verifies that the program is not currently being debugged and considers the error to be <b>unhandled.</b> The system then processes <b>unhandled</b> errors by looking in the registry for a program error debugger for which Dr. Watson is the default. A third-party debugger {{can also be used}} in place of Dr. Watson. The Watcom C Compiler includes a similar crash-analysis tool named [...] "Dr. Watcom".|$|E

50|$|An <b>unhandled</b> {{arithmetic}} overflow in {{the engine}} steering software was {{the primary cause of}} the crash of the 1996 maiden flight of the Ariane 5 rocket. The software had been considered bug-free since it had been used in many previous flights, but those used smaller rockets which generated lower acceleration than Ariane 5.|$|E
5000|$|Exceptions {{are raised}} in the code via the throw (...) procedure. Try {{statements}} allow the program to bail out of any nested block, {{and serve as a}} better replacement for intra-procedure gotos (which are still supported under Pascaline). Since <b>unhandled</b> exceptions generate errors by default, the throw (...) procedure can serve as a general purpose error flagging system.|$|E

50|$|Jazelle mode is entered via the BXJ instructions. A {{hardware}} {{implementation of}} Jazelle will only cover {{a subset of}} JVM bytecodes. For <b>unhandled</b> bytecodes—or if overridden by the operating system—the hardware will invoke the software JVM.

50|$|Rarer, but not {{uncommon}} {{even in the}} modern world, is the practice of leaving young horses completely <b>unhandled</b> until they {{are old enough to}} be ridden, usually between the age of two and four, and completing all ground training as well as training for riding at the same time. However, waiting until a horse is full grown to begin training is often far riskier for humans and requires considerably more skill to avoid injury.|$|E
50|$|Most crashes are {{the result}} of {{executing}} invalid machine instructions. Typical causes include incorrect address values in the program counter, buffer overflow, overwriting a portion of the affected program code due to an earlier bug, accessing invalid memory addresses, using an illegal opcode or triggering an <b>unhandled</b> exception. The original software bug that started this chain of events is typically considered to be the cause of the crash, which is discovered through the process of debugging. The original bug can be far removed from the code that actually crashed.|$|E
50|$|On Linux and Solaris platforms, if {{the native}} code {{registers}} {{itself as a}} signal handler, it could intercept signals intended for the JVM. A chain of responsibility {{can be used to}} allow native code to better inter-operate with the JVM. On Windows platforms, Structured Exception Handling (SEH) may be employed to wrap native code in SEH try/catch blocks so as to capture machine (CPU/FPU) generated software interrupts (such as NULL pointer access violations and divide-by-zero operations), and to handle these situations before the interrupt is propagated back up into the JVM (i.e. Java side code), in all likelihood resulting in an <b>unhandled</b> exception.|$|E
5000|$|These restarts, if <b>unhandled</b> by code, can be {{presented}} to users (as part of a user interface, that of a debugger for example), so that the user can select and invoke one of the available restarts. Since the condition handler is called {{in the context of}} the error (without unwinding the stack), full error recovery is possible in many cases, where other exception handling systems would have already terminated the current routine. The debugger itself can also be customized or replaced using the [...] dynamic variable. Code found within unwind-protect forms such as finalizers will also be executed as appropriate despite the exception.|$|E
5000|$|In Linux, a [...] "panic" [...] is an {{unrecoverable}} {{system error}} detected by the kernel, {{as opposed to}} similar errors detected by user space code. It is possible for kernel code to indicate such a condition by calling the [...] function located in the header file sys/system.h. However, most panics {{are the result of}} <b>unhandled</b> processor exceptions in kernel code, such as references to invalid memory addresses. These are typically indicative of a bug somewhere in the call chain leading to the panic. They can also indicate a failure of hardware, such as a failed RAM cell or errors in arithmetic functions in the processor caused by a processor bug, overheating/damaged processor, or a soft error.|$|E
5000|$|... svchost.exe (Service Host, or SvcHost) is {{a system}} process that hosts {{multiple}} Windows services in the Windows NT family of operating systems. Svchost is essential {{in the implementation of}} so-called shared service processes, where a number of services can share a process in order to reduce resource consumption. Grouping multiple services into a single process conserves computing resources, and this consideration was of particular concern to NT designers because creating Windows processes takes more time and consumes more memory than in other operating systems, e.g. in the Unix family. However, if one of the services causes an <b>unhandled</b> exception, the entire process may crash. In addition, identifying component services can be more difficult for end users. Problems with various hosted services, particularly with Windows Update, get reported by users (and headlined by the press) as involving svchost.|$|E
5000|$|In Haskell {{and other}} {{functional}} programming languages, {{it is common}} to use a data type that is just as big as it needs to be to express any possible result. For example, we could write a division function that returned the type , and a [...] function returning [...] The first is an option type, which has only one failure value, [...] The second case is a tagged union: a result is either some string with a descriptive error message, or a successfully read character. Haskell's type inference system helps ensure that callers deal with possible errors. Since the error conditions become explicit in the function type, looking at its signature immediately tells the programmer how to treat errors. In addition, tagged unions and option types form monads when endowed with appropriate functions: this may be used to keep the code tidy by automatically propagating <b>unhandled</b> error conditions.|$|E
