40|$|Peeling {{is one of}} {{the first}} {{operations}} in the manufacture of whole peeled and diced tomatoes, and the peelability of processing tomatoes is significantly affected by the presence of various tomato defects, in particular yellow eye and blossom-end rot. Tomato maturity also impacts both the percentage of peeled fruit and yield. Immature fruits are typically <b>undercolored</b> and small in size. Sunburned regions on the tomato surface are difficult to peel as well. In this study, we determined the impact of 24 selected tomato defects on tomato peelability and yield of whole peeled tomatoes. There are potential advantages to sorting to remove selected tomato defects early in the process...|$|R

5000|$|Trapping {{towards a}} rich black (a black with a support screen of another color {{added to it}} {{to give it a}} ‘deeper’ look and making it more opaque - often called [...] "undercolor"), will follow the same rules as {{trapping}} to a ‘normal’ black. However, a stay-away should be created for the supporting color to prevent misregistration from revealing the <b>undercolor</b> {{at the edges of the}} rich black object. In short, a stay-away pushes the <b>undercolor</b> away from the edge of the rich black, and is usually created with a single color black stroke, set to [...] "knock-out".|$|E

5000|$|Color is an {{important}} feature of most living organisms. In the wild, color has great significance affecting the survival and reproductive success of the species. The environmental constraints which lead to the specific colors of birds and animals are very strong and individuals of novel colors tend not to survive. Under domestication, mankind has transformed all the species involved which have thus been freed from environmental pressures to a large extent. Early color variants were mostly selected for utility reasons or religious practices. In more recent centuries color varieties have been created purely for ornament and pleasure, fashion playing a surprisingly large part in their development. A bewildering array of colors and patterns can now {{be found in the}} domestic fowl. In the last decades white plumage color has become essential for the efficient processing of broilers and most types of meat-type poultry. Slaughterhouses and meat processing plants require poultry with a white or very light <b>undercolor</b> to produce carcasses without the typical [...] "hair", which colored chickens have, that necessitates singeing after plucking.|$|E
5000|$|Since 1959 it {{had been}} {{reported}} that recessive white c allele in homocygosis significantly reduces body growth rate and body size in a magnitude of 4-10%. This was later confirmed in meat-type chickens by the researches of Fox and Smyth, and in egg-type breeds {{by the research of}} Mèrat and coworkers. This is a serious drawback to the poultry meat-type production which remains unsolved to the present day. A white or very light <b>undercolor</b> is essential for the efficient processing of broilers and decrepit layers in slaughterhouses and meat processing plants, however White Plymouth Rock, a typical [...] "recessive white" [...] breed, continues to be used as the female side of most commercial broiler crosses, while White Cornish continues to be used as the male side. As a result, most modern broiler chickens are homozygous c/c.It is of importance to the meat breeding industry to know the magnitude of the depression in growth rate caused by the recessive white genotype in the commercial stocks.Also, several other pigment dilution genes, have been reported to depress growth rate. The experimental results of Fox and Smyth in 1985 also proved that c (recessive white) and I (dominant white) do not act in additive manner in influencing growth rate, and more importantly, the depression observed for [...] "recessive white" [...] was not enhanced by the presence of [...] "dominant white" [...] (I). As part of the future strategy of the genetic work on the parent stocks of the male side It would not be necessary to eliminate segregating [...] "dominant white" [...] from recessive white lines, but it would be economically advantageous to remove [...] "recessive white" [...] from the male lines.|$|E
40|$|Most {{present day}} color scanners, with red, green, and blue filters, are non-colorimetric. This means that their outputs cannot be linearly {{transformed}} into CIE tristimulus values for arbitrary input materials. On the other hand, by restricting oneself {{to a single}} class of inputs such as photographic, lithographic, or xerographic materials, very accurate scanner calibrations are possible. In this paper, we conjecture that such accurate calibrations can be achieved if the input document is made with only "three colorants", i. e., has only three independent degrees of freedom. The validity of the above conjecture is tested experimentally using a CMYK (four colorant) printer. Usually in CMYK printing, {{there are only three}} fundamental degrees of freedom. Even though four colorants are used, the amounts of these colorants are inter-related through the method used for <b>undercolor</b> removal (UCR). The fourth degree of freedom is re-introduced when the method of <b>undercolor</b> removal is varied. To tes [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Members of {{the graphic}} arts {{industries}} are slowly {{becoming aware of}} <b>undercolor</b> reduction techniques used {{in the attempt to}} help stabilize high speed wet printing. <b>Undercolor</b> removal is a color correction method which follows this line of thought as it reduces the amount of ink coverage by the process-color inks and increases ink coverage of the black printer in the darker neutral areas of a reproduction. The advantages realized by this technique are carried even further with gray-component replacement (GCR). GCR removes the process color inks that make up a dark tone and replaces them with black ink in both neutral and color regions of a reproduction. This separation method provides technical and cost benefits to the printer. An investigation of this reproduction technique forms the basis of this research project. A comparison was made between the quality performance of gray-component replacement techniques and the traditional four-color reproduction method. It was found through visual subjective testing, while not all the tone reproduction criteria favored the traditional four-color reproduction method, color and print contrast were affected by the use of gray-component replacement...|$|E
40|$|When {{typesetting}} a color {{book the}} goal is to produce a separate printer plate for each of the colors. The process of splitting the printed output into separate plates is called color separation. There are two color separation methods commonly used. Custom color separation selects colors from a standard pallet. A different plate is created for each color in the book. Process color separation separates the colors into the subtractive color components cyan, magenta and yellow, and creates a separate black plate by a process called <b>undercolor</b> removal. These four plates are used by a printing press to mix the colors on paper when the book is printed. Color separation is a more involved process than simply assigning RGB values to a desktop color printer. This article addresses the issues of professional color separation, and demonstrates how T E X with a suitable dvi driver can be used to produce quality custom and process color books...|$|E
40|$|A type {{of black}} printer that only existed in theory {{is now being}} applied in the {{printing}} industry. The process which makes use of this black printer is known as gray-component replacement. Developed from {{the extension of the}} <b>undercolor</b> removal process, the use of gray-component replacement in printing halftone reproductions is said to result in numerous technical and cost benefits. When used to the maximum, the process eliminates one of the three process color inks in a given unit area and prints black ink from highlight to shadow. A problem can result from the use of this process as it applies a greater amount of an opaque black ink in combination with selectively transparent colored inks. Where this black ink overprints {{one or more of the}} three colored inks there will be an increase in unwanted absorption and a decrease in the wanted absorption. The result of such overprinting will be the alteration of the reflectance curve of the reproduction as compared to the original with the result being a shift in hue. An experiment was performed to demonstrate the principles. Several tint patches were printed with the only difference between each patch being the location of black ink overprinting within the tint. It could be seen by visual analysis that a hue shift did occur. Sample tint patches were analyzed by means of a spectrophotometer to objectively describe the visual results...|$|E

40|$|Due to some {{inherent}} advantages, rotated dot screens are {{the most}} common halftoning method. The color re-production of rotated dot schemes is more robust with respect to mis-registration errors than color reproduc-tion using other halftoning schemes (e. g., dot-on-dot or dot-off-dot). In order to achieve good overall print qual-ity, however, the angles between the different color sepa-rations have to be precisely controlled, or moiré will occur. This precise control of the screen angles is gener-ally not possible in digital systems with their inherent discrete resolution. At the high resolutions commonly used in offset printing (e. g., ≥ 2400 × 2400 dpi), the dis-crete nature of the screen is normally not a critical is-sue. The problem persists, however, at resolutions commonly found in xerographic printers. Because moiré is a strong function of the relative screen angles, especially of the c,m,k separations, many approaches have been explored for mitigating moiré pat-terns via halftone screen and screen angle design. How-ever, as will be shown in this paper, moiré is also a strong function of the geometry of the individual halftone dot, specifically the dot area coverage of the halftone dot. It is this dependence that is described and exploited in this paper. More specifically, a method is described that reduces the c,m,k moiré by using a variable <b>undercolor</b> removal (UCR) and gray component replacement (GCR) scheme for a given halftone screen. Preliminary work was published in a conference proceeding. 10 This article is a more detailed and complete description of the work. Modeling Moiré In Color Printing The effect of moiré in color printing has long been known and has led to the common color layout of using cyan and magenta at plus and minus 15 °, black, or key, at 45 ° and yellow at 0 °. In this scenario, cyan, magenta and black use the identical screen frequencies. In this way, the interaction, or moiré, between cyan and ma-genta has identical frequency and orientation as the black separation. The result is a zero frequency moir...|$|E
