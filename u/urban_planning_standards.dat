To make this, the Master Plans of many municipalities are examined. Therefore, the housing needs outlined in the municipal Plans are compared with the trends in population growth.

Moreover, a quantitative analysis of <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> <b>standards</b> is taken into account.

The {{concept of}} {{sustainability}} or green architecture {{is not considered}} a new term, it is rather a concept embodied by the traditional architecture {{in different parts of}} the world since old ages via spontaneous and experimental compatibility.

Rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems {{have the potential to}} be an important contributor to urban water self-sufficiency. The goal {{of this study was to}} select an environmentally optimal RWH strategy in newly constructed residential buildings linked to rainwater demand for laundry under Mediterranean climatic conditions, without accounting for water from the mains. Methods: Different strategies were environmentally assessed for the design and use of RWH infrastructures in residential apartment blocks in Mediterranean climates. The harvested rainwater was used for laundry in all strategies. These strategies accounted for (i) tank location (i. e., tank distributed over the roof and underground tank), (ii) building height considering the number of stories (i. e., 6, 9, 12, and 15), and (iii) distribution strategy (i. e., shared laundry, supply to the nearest apartments, and distribution throughout the building). The RWH systems consisted of the catchment, storage, and distribution stages, and the structural and hydraulic calculations were based on Mediterranean conditions. The quantification of the environmental performance of each strategy (e. g., CO₂eq. emissions) was performed in accordance with the life cycle assessment methodology. Results and discussion: According to the environmental assessment, the tank location and distribution strategy chosen were the most important variables in the optimization of RWH systems. Roof tank strategies present fewer impacts than their underground tank equivalents because they enhance energy and material savings, and their reinforcement requirements can be accounted for within the safety factors of the building structure without the tank. Among roof tanks and depending on the height, a distribution strategy that concentrates demand in a laundry room was the preferable option, resulting in reductions from 25 to 54 % in most of the selected impact categories compared to distribution throughout the building. Conclusions: These results may set new <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> <b>standards</b> for the design and construction of buildings from the perspective of sustainable water management. In this sense, a behavioral change regarding demand should be promoted in compact, dense urban settlements...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (PhD) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2013. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The 21 st Century is {{witnessing}} the concurrence of neoliberal globalisation and widespread informalisation. To this extent, {{the informal sector}} or economy {{is perceived as a}} permanent ‘feature of modern capitalist development’ (Chen 2007 : 2). Its expansion, particularly in developing countries, has far reaching implications for employment generation, occupational or livelihood diversification, urban form dynamics, urban planning, as well as the general economic outcome. The historical evolutionary truth of the informal origin of most businesses coupled with the reality of informal-formal sector continuum gives credence to the critical imperative of multi-path development regime that does not consider the informal sector as a dead end. Consequently, the research explored the policy implications of the spatial and structural relationships between the informal and formal business sectors in urban Nigeria. The study region is viewed from the prism of Enugu, the major administrative centre in the southeast region of the country. Here, spatial-structural causalities at the city level are conjectured as surrogates of the globalisation-induced transformations occurring in the country from 1990 to 2010 (Andranovich & Riposa 1993). The research sought to: one, examine the extent relationships between the distribution structures of two economic segments in the city; and two, explore the changes in inter-sectoral linkages and the urban business landscape mediated by the global-local economic changes. To guide the study, two research hypotheses were formulated, viz. : (1) to prove whether or not some significant spatial/structural relationships exist between the distribution of informal and formal business units in the study area; and (2) to verify if the observed changes in the spatial and structural relationships between the two segments are accounted for by the same sets of physical, economic, and socio-cultural variables. The study made use of primary and secondary data, which were collected via mixed research methods. The proportional stratified sampling was used where necessary. The primary data were collected through casual observation/recognisance, photographic and questionnaire surveys, and semi-structured personal interviews; while the secondary data were sourced from literature review, maps and databanks of local governments and Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS). The data analytical procedure involved data reduction and hypotheses testing. The former technique consists of sectoral aggregation (the segmentation by coherent attribute-sectors) and spatial aggregation (translation from quantitative into spatial dimensions) (Wang & Vom Hofe 2007), while the latter required the use of Spatial Statistics Analysis toolsets of the ArGIS software and the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the SPSS package. The Spatial Statistics Analysis (the Spatial Autocorrelation or Moran’s I index) and PCA results permitted the rejection of the two null hypotheses respectively. The Moran’s I index is 0. 16 with a Z score of 159. 78 at a significant level of. 01 and critical value of 2. 58, revealing a highly clustered spatial association (or dependence) between the informal and formal business distribution in the study area. Based on the eigenvalues of 10 selected variables, the PCA extracted three major determinants of the observed spatial-structural causalities, namely: socio-economic and cultural traits or business ethos, client base and market control, and physical environment/business transaction mode. The findings challenges the received model of Nigeria retail hierarchy, and among the key recommendations for guaranteeing stronger informal-formal sector linkages that are generative of sustainable endogenous development are: (i) the reinstatement of the import substitution programme; (ii) implementation of the innovative Cluster Concept of Industrial Development Strategy (CCIDS) of 2007; and (iii) adoption of <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> <b>standards</b> that are pro-informal sector.

Hier word ruimetelik-struktureleoorsaaklikhedegebruik as maatstawwe vir die transformasieswatdeurglobalisasieveroorsaak is, en wattussen 1990 en 2010 in die land plaasgvind het (Andranovich&Riposa 1993). Daar is in die navorsinggepoog om eerstens die omvang van verwantskappetussen die verspreidingstrukture van die twee ekonomiesesegmente van die stad vas te stel, en tweedens, om die veranderings in inter-sektorieseskakels en die stedelike sake landskapwatdeur die globaale-plaaslikeekonomieseveranderingsbemiddel is, te bestudeer. Twee navorsinghipoteses is geformaliseer, naamlik (1) om te bewys of daarbetekenisvolleruimtelike/struktureleverwantskappebestaantussen die verspreiding van informele en formeleeenhede in die studie- gebied, en (2) om te bevestig of die veranderings in die ruimtelike en struktureleverwantskappetussen die twee besigheidsegmentetoegeskryfkan word aandieselfdestelfisiese, ekonomiese en sosio-kultureleveranderlikes. In die studie is daargebruikgemaak van primêre en sekondêre data watdeurmiddel van gemengdenavorsingmetodesversamel is. Die proporsioneelgestratifiseerdesteekproefmetode is, waarnodig, gebruik. Die primêre data is deurterloopseobservasie, fotografiese- en vraelysopnames, en semi-gestruktureerde persoonlike onderhoudeversamel, terwyl die sekondêre data verkry is uit ’n oorsig van die letterkunde, landkaarte, en die databanke van plaaslikeowerhede en die binnelandsebelastingsdiens.
