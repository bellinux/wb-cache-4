2500|$|A {{definition}} of entropy based {{entirely on the}} relation of adiabatic accessibility between equilibrium states was given by [...] E.H.Lieb and J. Yngvason in 1999. This approach has several predecessors, including the pioneering work of Constantin Carathéodory from 1909 and the monograph by R. Giles. In the setting of Lieb and Yngvason one starts by picking, for a <b>unit</b> <b>amount</b> of the substance under consideration, two reference states [...] and [...] such that the latter is adiabatically accessible from the former but not vice versa. Defining the [...] entropies of the reference states to be 0 and 1 respectively the entropy of a state [...] {{is defined as the}} largest number [...] such that [...] is adiabatically accessible from a composite state consisting of an amount [...] in the state [...] and a complementary amount, , in the state [...] A simple but important result within this setting is that entropy is uniquely determined, apart from a choice of unit and an additive constant for each chemical element, by the following properties: It is monotonic with respect to the relation of adiabatic accessibility, additive on composite systems, and extensive under scaling.|$|E

50|$|Metal {{carbonyl}} clusters {{have several}} properties {{that suggest that}} they may prove as useful catalysts. The absence of large bulk phases leads to a high surface-to-volume ratio, which is advantageous in any catalyst application as this maximizes the reaction rate per <b>unit</b> <b>amount</b> of catalyst material, which also minimizes cost. Although surface metal sites in heterogeneous catalysts are coordinatively unsaturated, most synthetic clusters are not. In general, {{as the number of}} atoms in a metal particle decrease, their coordination number decreases, and significantly so in particles having less than 100 atoms. This is illustrated by the figure at right, which shows dispersion (ratio of undercoordinated surface atoms to total atoms) versus number of metal atoms per particle for ideal icosahedral metal clusters.|$|E
