40|$|Abstract: This paper {{synthetically}} analyzed essential {{features of}} various support methods in engineering geological soft rock, proposed a scheme that organically combines active support(like anchor bolt support) with passive support (like <b>U-shaped</b> steel <b>bracket</b> support), analyzed fundamentals of this combined support scheme, and forecasted support {{effect of this}} support scheme. It provides roadway support design with fresh ideas. <b>U-shaped</b> steel <b>bracket</b> can be translated into special anchor plate {{with the help of}} a section of simple steel channel beam, so effect of anchor bolt can be ensured; <b>U-shaped</b> steel <b>bracket,</b> this extremely long curved beam,will be divided into several sections of short beams, so its bearing ability will be several times improved. Cost of this combined support scheme is low, its process is simple and its application prospect is wide. 1 Engineering geological features of soft rock At present, soft rock that scholars are talking about is the “engineering soft rock”, that is, the engineering rock which will have a significant plastic deformation under the actions of engineering forces. Engineering soft rock is divided into four categories: expansive soft rock (or low-pressure soft rock), high-stress soft rock, fractured soft rock and composite soft rock...|$|R

40|$|Modeling the {{thermomechanical}} {{behavior of}} the bonded sands used for steel sand casting is of great importance for the prediction of distortions and pattern allowances. In this study, distortions created by mechanical interactions between the casting and sand mold are measured from two experimental setups and then predicted by finite element stress analyses. The casting geometries involve a hollow cylinder for the first experiment and <b>U-shaped</b> <b>bracket</b> for the second. The temporal evolutions of 1) the cylinder’s inner diameter and 2) the gap opening between the bracket legs are measured in situ utilizing LVDTs (Linear Variable Differential Transformers) connected to quartz rods. The considerable distortions measured during the cylinder and bracket experiments are mainly caused by core expansion and core restraint, respectively. For the simulations, a one-way temperature-displacement coupling is adopted, in which temperatures are predicted using commercial casting simulation software and then used as inputs for the finite element stress analyses. The steel is modeled as an elasto-visco-plastic material, whereas the Drucker Prager Cap model is employed for the bonded sand. It is found that sand dilation (i. e., the volumetric expansion of a granular media due to a shear force) must be considered for the cylinder experiments. Otherwise, the inner diameter expansion observed during solidification is far under-predicted. For the bracket, a crack plane must {{be included in the}} stress simulation model. If not, the outer mold restrains the bracket legs from being pushed outward and distortions are under-predicted. By matching the predicted displacements with the measurements, a constitutive dataset for bonded sands is developed, whose predictive capability is then demonstrated through a case study...|$|E

50|$|All Stoner 63/63A barrels are gas {{nitrided}} {{and have}} a quick-detach capability and can be removed {{in a matter of}} seconds in field conditions by simply pushing down a latch located on top of the weapon in front of the feed cover and pulling the barrel forward (with the bolt retracted). The chamber portion of the barrel rests on a <b>U-shaped</b> barrel <b>bracket</b> attached to the gas cylinder. The barrel is firmly locked in position by means of a spring-loaded latch (with two nested coil springs) which drives a steel pin into a hole in the barrel socket. All barrels have a gas block to which a bayonet lug and front sight assembly are mounted. The barrels are equipped with a bird cage type flash suppressor with six oval ports. The AR and standard machine gun barrels also have a carrying handle that can be snapped into one of three positions or removed altogether. The black-painted wooden handles are attached to a steel rod via roll pin. With a few exceptions, all the barrels used in the Stoner 63/63A have a six-groove right-hand rifling with a twist rate of 1:12-inch (305 mm), designed to stabilize the lightweight 55-grain M193 projectile, which was standard at the time. At the Army's request, Cadillac Gage submitted for testing rifles, carbines, and light machine guns, with 1:9-inch (230 mm) twist barrels, respectively designated XM22E2, XM23E2, and XM207E2. The different twist was to test the 68-grain XM287 and XM288 bullets. After NWM obtained a license to produce the Stoner 63A, some barrels were manufactured with a 1:8-inch (200 mm) in rifling pitch to be used with heavier experimental bullets. None of these were ever produced in significant numbers.|$|R
40|$|Space trusses are a {{valuable}} structural form for architects and structural engineers due mainly to their efficiency in providing large unobstructed areas, associated with faster erection speeds and low maintenance cost. Most space trusses {{are made of}} steel and aluminium whilst a few are of timber. Interest is now shifting from the traditional use of timber in plane trusses of relatively short span, to new structural forms for medium to long spans. In adopting such systems in timber for non-traditional roofing applications, the challenge lies in developing structurally sound, visually neat and economically reproducible connectors for 3 -dimensional configurations of timber members. The research aimed at developing a new connector for double and triple-layer space grids in timber, intended for medium-span lightweight roofing applications. The origins of the connector date back to 1995, {{when it was first}} proposed by Zingoni as the 14 FTC-U Timber Space-Truss Connector, and subsequently tested under laboratory conditions over the three years that followed. Unlike connectors for timber space grids proposed by earlier investigators, or the proprietary connector systems that are available for constructions in steel and aluminium, the 14 FTC-U connector features a central core of wood {{in the form of a}} cuboctahedron or its variants, upon whose faces are attached <b>U-shaped</b> metal <b>brackets</b> that take the timber members. Thus the connector unit is predominantly wood, giving it considerable aesthetic advantages over its all-metal counterparts. While promising, the structural performance of the original connector was not adequate for practical application, hence a programme of further development was embarked upon. As reported in the thesis, the improvements of the connector have culminated in a structurally viable unit that has been successfully employed in a prototype double-layer timber grid...|$|R
