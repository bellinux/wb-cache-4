25|$|The {{shift toward}} riskier {{mortgages}} and private label MBS distribution occurred as financial institutions sought to maintain earnings levels {{that had been}} elevated during 2001–2003 by an unprecedented refinancing boom due to historically low interest rates. Earnings depended on volume, so maintaining elevated earnings levels necessitated expanding the borrower pool using lower <b>underwriting</b> <b>standards</b> and new products that the GSEs would not (initially) securitize. Thus, the shift away from GSE securitization to private-label securitization (PLS) also corresponded with a shift in mortgage product type, from traditional, amortizing, fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) to nontraditional, structurally riskier, nonamortizing, adjustable-rate mortgages (ARM's), and in {{the start of a}} sharp deterioration in mortgage <b>underwriting</b> <b>standards.</b> The growth of PLS, however, forced the GSEs to lower their <b>underwriting</b> <b>standards</b> in an attempt to reclaim lost market share to please their private shareholders. Shareholder pressure pushed the GSEs into competition with PLS for market share, and the GSEs loosened their guarantee business <b>underwriting</b> <b>standards</b> in order to compete. In contrast, the wholly public FHA/Ginnie Mae maintained their <b>underwriting</b> <b>standards</b> and instead ceded market share.|$|E

25|$|As {{mortgage}} originators {{began to}} distribute {{more and more}} of their loans through private label MBSs, GSEs lost the ability to monitor and control mortgage originators.

In addition, off–balance sheet treatment for securitizations coupled with guarantees from the issuer are said to make the securitizing firm's leverage less transparent, thereby facilitating risky capital structures and allowing credit risk underpricing. Off–balance sheet securitizations are believed to have played a large role in the high leverage ratio of US financial institutions before the financial crisis.|$|E

However, existing loan underwriting practices provide no incentive for building owners to make their buildings more energy efficient. In this paper, we develop a commercial-mortgage valuation, or underwriting, strategy that accounts for the energy risk of individual office buildings, this energy risk being a function of both the relative energy efficiency of the building and the characteristics of its location. Our method extends <b>standard</b> <b>underwriting</b> practices, which account for the expected dynamics of interest rates and office building prices over time, by including the expected dynamics of the electricity and gas prices as well as quantity dynamics appropriate to the location of the building. This allows lenders to explicitly take into account the effect of energy use and various alternative efficiency measures when underwriting commercial mortgages...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{undertake}} a systematic process of verification of consumer accounts of alleged genetic discrimination. Methods: Verification of incidents reported in life insurance and other contexts that {{met the criteria}} of genetic discrimination, {{and the impact of}} fear of such treatment, was determined, with consent, through interview, document analysis and where appropriate, direct contact with the third party involved. The process comprised obtaining evidence that the alleged incident was accurately reported and determining whether the decision or action seemed to be justifiable and/or ethical. Results: Reported incidents of genetic discrimination were verified in life insurance access, underwriting and coercion (9), applications for worker 2 ̆ 7 s compensation (1) and early release from prison (1) and in two cases of fear of discrimination impacting on access to genetic testing. Relevant conditions were inherited cancer susceptibility (8), Huntington disease (3), hereditary hemochromatosis (1), and polycystic kidney disease (1). In two cases, the reversal of an adverse <b>underwriting</b> decision to <b>standard</b> rate after intervention with insurers by genetics health professionals was verified. The mismatch between consumer and third party accounts in three life insurance incidents involved miscommunication or lack of information provision by financial advisers. Conclusion: These first cases of verified genetic discrimination make it essential for policies and guidelines to be developed and implemented to ensure appropriate use of genetic test results in insurance underwriting, to promote education and training in the financial industry, and to provide support for consumers and health professionals undertaking challenges of adverse decisions...|$|R
40|$|EXTENDED ABSTRACT The {{far-reaching}} {{impact of}} Web on society is widely recognised and acknowledged. The interdisciplinary {{study of this}} impact has crystallised {{in the field of}} study known as Web Science. However, defining an agreed, shared understanding of what constitutes Web Science requires complex negotiation and translations of understandings across component disciplines, national cultures and educational traditions. Some individual institutions have already established particular curricula, and discussions in the Web Science Curriculum Workshop series have marked the territory to some extent. This paper reports on a process being adopted across a consortium of partners to systematically create a shared understanding of what constitutes Web Science. It records and critiques the processes instantiated to agree a common curriculum, and presents a framework for future discussion and development. The need to study the Web in its complexity, development and impact {{led to the creation of}} Web Science. Web Science is inherently interdisciplinary. Its goal is to: a) understand the Web growth mechanisms; b) create approaches that allow new powerful and more beneficial mechanisms to occur. Teaching Web Science is a unique experience since the emerging discipline is a combination of two essential features. On one hand, the analysis of microscopic laws extrapolated to the macroscopic realm generates observed behaviour. On the other hand languages and algorithms on the Web are built in order to produce novel desired computer behaviour that should be put in context. Finding a suitable curriculum that is different from the study of language, algorithms, interaction patterns and business processes is thus an important and challenging task for the simple reason that we believe that the future of sociotechnical systems will be in their innovative power (inventing new ways to solve problems), rather than their capacity to optimize current practices. The Web Science Curriculum Development (WSCD) Project focuses European expertise in this interdisciplinary endeavour with the ultimate aim of designing a joint masters program for Web Science between the partner universities. The process of curriculum definition is being addressed using a negotiation process which mirrors the web science and engineering approach described by Berners-Lee (figure 1 below). The process starts on the engineering side (right). From the technical design point of view the consortium is creating an open repository of shared educational artefacts using EdShare [1] (based on EPrints) to collect or reference the whole range of educational resources being used in our various programmes. Socially, these resources will be annotated against a curriculum categorization [2] which in itself is subject to negotiation and change, currently via a wiki. This last process is represented by complexity and collaboration at the bottom of the diagram. The resources necessarily extend beyond artefacts used in the lecture and seminar room encompassing artefacts associated with the administrative and organisational processes which are necessary to assure the comparability of the educational resources and <b>underwrite</b> the quality <b>standards</b> of the associated awards. Figure 1 : Web Science and Engineering Approach (e. g. See [URL] From the social point of view the contributions will be discussed and peer reviewed by members of the consortium. Our intention is that by sharing the individual components of the teaching and educational process and quality assuring them by peer review we will provide concrete examples of our understanding of the discipline. However, as Berners-Lee observes, it is in the move from the micro to the macro that the magic (complexity) is involved. The challenge for our consortium, once our community repository is adequately populated, is to involve the wider community in the contribution, discussion and annotation that will lead to the evolution of a negotiated and agreed but evolving curriculum for Web Science. Others have worked on using community approaches to developing curriculum. For example, in the Computer Science community there is a repository of existing syllabi [3] that enables designers of new courses to understand how others have approached the problem, and the Information Science community is using a wiki [4] to enable the whole community to contribute to the dynamic development of the curriculum. What makes this project unique is that rather than taking a top down structured approach to curriculum definition it takes a bottom up approach, using the actual teaching materials as the basis on which to iteratively negotiate and refine the definition of the curriculum...|$|R
2500|$|As a Government Sponsored Enterprise, or GSE, Fannie Mae is {{compelled}} {{by law to}} provide liquidity to mortgage originators in all economic conditions. It must legally ignore adverse market conditions which appear to be unprofitable. If there are loans available for purchase that meet its predetermined <b>underwriting</b> <b>standards,</b> it must purchase them if no other buyers are available. Due to the size, scale, {{and scope of the}} United States single-family residential and commercial residential markets, market participants viewed Fannie Mae corporate debt as having a very high probability of being repaid. Fannie Mae is able to borrow very inexpensively in the debt markets as a consequence of market perception. There usually exists a large difference between the rate it can borrow at and the rate it can 'lend' at. This was called [...] "The big, fat gap" [...] by Alan Greenspan. By August 2008, Fannie Mae's mortgage portfolio was in excess of $700 billion.|$|E

5000|$|In {{separate}} {{testimony to}} Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, officers of Clayton Holdings—the largest residential loan due diligence and securitization surveillance {{company in the}} United States and Europe—testified that Clayton's review of over 900,000 mortgages issued from January 2006 to June 2007 revealed that scarcely 54% of the loans met their originators’ <b>underwriting</b> <b>standards.</b> The analysis (conducted on behalf of 23 investment and commercial banks, including 7 [...] "too big to fail" [...] banks) additionally showed that 28% of the sampled loans {{did not meet the}} minimal standards of any issuer.

50|$|However, {{the credit}} crisis of 2007-2008 has exposed a {{potential}} {{flaw in the}} securitization process - loan originators retain no residual risk for the loans they make, but collect substantial fees on loan issuance and securitization, which doesn't encourage improvement of <b>underwriting</b> <b>standards.</b>|$|E
5000|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} that the riskiest, worst performing mortgages were funded through the [...] "shadow banking system" [...] and that competition from the shadow banking system may have pressured more traditional institutions to lower their own <b>underwriting</b> <b>standards</b> and originate riskier loans.|$|E
50|$|Following {{example of}} Countrywide Financial, the largest U.S. {{mortgage}} lender, many lenders adopt automated loan approvals that critics argued were not subjected to appropriate review and documentation according to good mortgage <b>underwriting</b> <b>standards.</b> In 2007, 40% of all subprime loans resulted from automated underwriting.Mortgage fraud by borrowers increases.|$|E
50|$|Critics have {{suggested}} that the complexity inherent in securitization can limit investors' ability to monitor risk, and that competitive securitization markets with multiple securitizers may be particularly prone to sharp declines in <b>underwriting</b> <b>standards.</b> Private, competitive mortgage securitization {{played an important role in}} the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis.|$|E
5000|$|The {{underwriting}} {{cycle is}} {{the tendency of}} property and casualty insurance premiums, profits, and availability of coverage to rise and fall with some regularity over time. A cycle begins when insurers tighten their <b>underwriting</b> <b>standards</b> and sharply raise premiums {{after a period of}} severe underwriting losses or negative stocks to capital (e.g., investment losses). Stricter standards and higher premium rates lead to an increase in profits and accumulation of capital. The increase in underwriting capacity increases competition, which in turn drives premium rates down and relaxes <b>underwriting</b> <b>standards,</b> thereby causing underwriting losses and setting the stage for the cycle to begin again. For example, Lloyd's Franchise Performance Director Rolf Tolle stated in 2007 that [...] "mitigating the insurance cycle was the [...] "biggest challenge" [...] facing managing agents in the next few years".|$|E
50|$|A contrarian {{view is that}} Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac {{led the way to}} relaxed <b>underwriting</b> <b>standards,</b> {{starting}} in 1995, by advocating the use of easy-to-qualify automated underwriting and appraisal systems, by designing the no-downpayment products issued by lenders, by the promotion of thousands of small mortgage brokers, and by their close relationship to subprime loan aggregators such as Countrywide.|$|E
50|$|Another {{narrative}} {{about the}} origin {{has been focused on}} the respective parts played by the public monetary policy (in the US notably) and by the practices of private financial institutions. In the U.S., mortgage funding was unusually decentralised, opaque, and competitive, and it is believed that competition between lenders for revenue and market share contributed to declining <b>underwriting</b> <b>standards</b> and risky lending.|$|E
50|$|As {{mortgage}} originators {{began to}} distribute {{more and more}} of their loans through private label MBS, GSEs lost the ability to monitor and control mortgage originators. Competition between the GSEs and private securitizers for loans further undermined GSEs power and strengthened mortgage originators.
