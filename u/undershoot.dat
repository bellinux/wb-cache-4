25|$|If a kernel is non-negative, such {{as for a}} Gaussian kernel, {{then the}} value of the {{filtered}} signal will be a convex combination of the input values (the coefficients (the kernel) integrate to 1, and are non-negative), and will thus fall between the minimum and maximum of the input signal – it will not <b>undershoot</b> or overshoot. If, on the other hand, the kernel assumes negative values, such as the sinc function, then {{the value of the}} filtered signal will instead be an affine combination of the input values, and may fall outside of the minimum and maximum of the input signal, resulting in <b>undershoot</b> and overshoot, as in the Gibbs phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|In signal processing, the Gibbs {{phenomenon}} is undesirable because it causes artifacts, namely clipping from the overshoot and <b>undershoot,</b> and ringing {{artifacts from the}} oscillations.

This article is {{an introduction to}} a special issue aimed at analyzing the factors of the <b>undershooting.</b> The articles in this issue explore the following hypotheses: {{the impact of a}} series of counter-inflationary shocks; a biased forecasting system; a faulty decision-making system; and the role of inflation expectations.

25|$|The {{change in}} the MR signal from {{neuronal}} activity is called the hemodynamic response (HDR). It lags the neuronal events triggering it {{by a couple of}} seconds, since it takes a while for the vascular system to respond to the brain's need for glucose. From this point it typically rises to a peak at about 5seconds after the stimulus. If the neurons keep firing, say from a continuous stimulus, the peak spreads to a flat plateau while the neurons stay active. After activity stops, the BOLD signal falls below the original level, the baseline, a phenomenon called the <b>undershoot.</b> Over time the signal recovers to the baseline. There is some evidence that continuous metabolic requirements in a brain region contribute to the <b>undershoot.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{course of}} the action {{potential}} {{can be divided into}} five parts: the rising phase, the peak phase, the falling phase, the <b>undershoot</b> phase, and the refractory period. During the rising phase the membrane potential depolarizes (becomes more positive). The point at which depolarization stops is called the peak phase. At this stage, the membrane potential reaches a maximum. Subsequent to this, there is a falling phase. During this stage the membrane potential becomes more negative, returning towards resting potential. The <b>undershoot,</b> or afterhyperpolarization, phase is the period during which the membrane potential temporarily becomes more negatively charged than when at rest (hyperpolarized). Finally, the time during which a subsequent action potential is impossible or difficult to fire is called the refractory period, which may overlap with the other phases.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{primarily}} concerned with assessing the bias of the CNB’s predictions in re-lation to <b>undershooting</b> of the inflation target. We conclude that the inflation prediction error has decreased over time. We further point out that GDP growth and interest rates were, respectively, {{above and below the}} forecast most of the time, even in a situation of systematic <b>undershooting</b> of the target. Thus, the <b>undershooting</b> cannot be explained with the help of standard demand mechanisms. Positive supply impulses were admittedly underestimated in the past. According to our findings, about half of the apparent target <b>undershooting</b> in 2003 was due to errors in the predictions of exogenous factors (foreign interest rates, GDP, and inflation). As follows from the distribution of the inflation pre-diction errors across separate price segments, overpredictions of inflation during most of the period under review were due to mistakes in the prediction of food prices and core CPI ex food, while prediction errors in energy prices mostly fostered convergence to the target. The prediction errors in regulated prices acted in both directions. 1...|$|R
25|$|The {{overshoot}} and <b>undershoot</b> can {{be understood}} thus: kernels are generally normalized to have integral 1, so they result in a mapping of constant functions to constant functions – otherwise they have gain. The value of a convolution at a point is a linear combination of the input signal, with coefficients (weights) {{the values of the}} kernel.|$|E
25|$|In {{electrical}} engineering, {{a multiple}} of τ is called the settling time, i.e. the time necessary to ensure the signal is within a fixed departure from final value, typically within 10%. The term overshoot refers to the extent the maximum response exceeds final value, and <b>undershoot</b> refers to the extent the response falls below final value for times following the maximum response.|$|E
25|$|The {{phenomenon}} of oscillation about the final value is called ringing. The overshoot is the maximum swing above final value, and clearly increases with μ. Likewise, the <b>undershoot</b> is the minimum swing below final value, again increasing with μ. The settling {{time is the}} time for departures from final value to sink below some specified level, say 10% of final value.|$|E
30|$|The {{novelty of}} our {{proposed}} PowerNap algorithm {{stems from the}} following differences between SleepWell and PowerNap. Firstly, we give weighted fair share from the very beginning, i.e., we estimate traffic loads of all APs in a distributed manner and distribute the transmission intervals to the contending APs according to this weighted estimation. Secondly, to avoid transmission overlapping, we use <b>undershooting,</b> e.g., the least traffic load estimation; the estimation process involves one hop neighborhood information exploitation only. Thirdly, the <b>undershooting</b> again helps PowerNap to reduce transmission overlapping among the APs unlike SleepWell and thus promotes fairness; and fourthly, the unused portions (created due to <b>undershooting)</b> of transmission rounds are also distributed in a weighted manner, and thus, it maintains good level of network throughput. Finally, we also address the existing hidden terminal problems in our algorithm.|$|R

Though {{it is unlikely that}} after the neighborhood assistance for fair share calculation, there would still be situations where APs will spill into the next beacon interval. But if the network is dense and the previous step fails to include every AP in the domain, such a spilling will occur. Thus, using an <b>undershooting</b> parameter to scale down the fair share would be a better idea; otherwise, the convergence of a steady state is unlikely to happen any time soon.|$|R
25|$|The raised voltage opened {{many more}} {{potassium}} channels than usual, {{and some of}} these do not close right away when the membrane returns to its normal resting voltage. In addition, further potassium channels open in response to the influx of calcium ions during the action potential. The potassium permeability of the membrane is transiently unusually high, driving the membrane voltage Vm even closer to the potassium equilibrium voltage EK. Hence, there is an <b>undershoot</b> or hyperpolarization, termed an afterhyperpolarization in technical language, that persists until the membrane potassium permeability returns to its usual value.|$|E
25|$|Taking {{a longer}} {{expansion}} – cutting {{at a higher}} frequency – corresponds in the frequency domain to widening the brick-wall, which in the time domain corresponds to narrowing the sinc function and increasing its height by the same factor, leaving the integrals between corresponding points unchanged. This is a general feature of the Fourier transform: widening in one domain corresponds to narrowing and increasing height in the other. This results in the oscillations in sinc being narrower and taller and, in the filtered function (after convolution), yields oscillations that are narrower and thus have less area, but does not reduce the magnitude: cutting off at any finite frequency results in a sinc function, however narrow, with the same tail integrals. This explains {{the persistence of the}} overshoot and <b>undershoot.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between the new monetary control procedures, implemented by the Federal Reserve Board in October 1979, and the subsequent increase in exchange rate variability for the United States. It shows that, {{in the context of a}} stochastic, rational expectations model,exchange rate variability minimizing monetary policy is identical to the policy which, in a deterministic, perfect foresight model, would place the economy on the borderline between exchange rate overshooting and <b>undershooting.</b> The model is estimated for the United States since generalized floating began in 1973. The new monetary control procedures have had two opposite effects. Monetary policy has become less accommodative, increasing exchange rate variability through overshooting. On the other hand,systematic deviations from uncovered interest rate parity, which can be attributed to exchange risk, have also increased. These increase exchange rate variability through <b>undershooting.</b> It is shown that the latter dominate the former, providing an explanation of increased exchange rate variability consistent with <b>undershooting,</b> not with overshooting. ...|$|R
