2500|$|In the 13th century Saint Thomas Aquinas {{addressed}} the Christologocal attribution of the nativity: Should it {{be attributed to}} the person (the Word) or only to the assumed human nature of that person. Aquinas treated nativity in 8 separate articles in Summa Theologica each posing a separate question, e.g.: [...] "Does Nativity regard the nature rather than the Person?", [...] "Should a temporal Nativity be attributed to Christ?" [...] "Should the Blessed Virgin be called Christ's Mother?", [...] "Should the Blessed Virgin be called the Mother of God?", [...] "Are there two filiations in Christ?", etc. To deal with this issue, Aquinas distinguishes between the person born and the nature in which the birth takes place. Aquinas thus resolved the question by arguing that in the hypostatic union Christ has two natures, one received from the Father from eternity, the other from his mother in time. This approach also resolved the Mariological problem of Mary receiving the title of Theotokos for <b>under</b> <b>this</b> <b>scenario</b> she is the [...] "Mother of God".|$|E

30|$|Live fuel loads {{decreased}} due to {{the removal}} of the shrubby midstory layer. Fine fuels increased but probably are not highly flammable since they were mostly hardwood leaves and twigs that were partially consumed by the fire before falling to the ground. Such fuels tend to lie flat, which decreases their potential for burning, especially in protected sites on which fire behavior is constrained by high humidity. Since periodic fires in the B treatment reduce the rate of fuel accumulation, relative to M, the potential for high-intensity fire is reduced compared to that treatment (Waldrop et al. 2010). Consumption of 10 hr fuels by fire was offset by new additions from top-killed shrubs and saplings, which explains why there was little to no reduction in fuel volumes <b>under</b> <b>this</b> treatment <b>scenario.</b>|$|R
2500|$|... "Deterioration, Then Limited Improvement" [...] {{is judged}} most likely by the IC. The {{infectious}} disease threat—particularly from HIV/AIDS—worsens {{during the first}} half of our time frame, but decreases fitfully after that, owing to better prevention and control efforts, new drugs and vaccines, and socioeconomic improvements. In the next decade, <b>under</b> <b>this</b> <b>scenario,</b> negative demographic and social conditions in developing countries, such as continued urbanization and poor health care capacity, remain conducive to the spread of infectious diseases; persistent poverty sustains the least developed countries as reservoirs of infection; and microbial resistance continues to increase faster than the pace of new drug and vaccine development. More positive demographic changes such as reduced fertility and aging populations; gradual socioeconomic improvement in most countries; medical advances; expanded international surveillance and response systems; and improvements in national health care capacities take hold in all but the least developed countries. Barring the appearance of a deadly and highly infectious new disease, a catastrophic upward lurch by HIV/AIDS, or the release of a highly contagious biological agent capable of rapid and widescale secondary spread, these developments produce at least limited gains against the overall infectious disease threat. The remaining virulent diseases, led by HIV/AIDS and TB, continue to take a significant toll.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is likely}} {{that he was not}} Merneptah's {{intended}} heir. Some scholars such as Kenneth Kitchen and Jürgen von Beckerath believe that Amenmesse usurped the throne from Seti-Merneptah, Merneptah's son and crown prince who should have been next in line to the royal succession. It is unclear how this would have happened. Kitchen has written that Amenmesse may have taken advantage of a momentary weakness of Seti-Merneptah or seized power while the crown prince was away in Asia. Seti-Merneptah was most likely the same man as king Seti II, whose reign was traditionally thought to have followed upon Amenmesse's reign. The cartouches of Seti II's tomb in Upper Egypt were deliberately erased and then repainted, suggesting that Seti's rule in Upper Egypt was temporarily interrupted by agents of his half-brother. Confusion generally clouds Amenmesse's reign and location within the Egyptian 19th Dynasty. However, an increasing number of Egyptologists today such as Rolf Krauss and Aidan Dodson maintain that Seti II was in fact the immediate successor of Merneptah [...] "without any intervening rule by Amenmesse." [...] <b>Under</b> <b>this</b> <b>scenario,</b> Amenmesse did not succeed Merneptah on the throne of Egypt and was rather a rival king who usurped power sometime during Years 2 to 4 of Seti II's reign in Upper Egypt and Nubia where his authority is monumentally attested. Amenmesse was documented in power at Thebes during his third and fourth year (and perhaps earlier in Nubia) where Seti II's Year 3 and Year 4 are noticeably unaccounted for. The treatment of Amenmesse as a rival king also best explains the pattern of destruction to Seti II's tomb which was initially ransacked and later restored again by Seti II's officials. This implies that the respective reigns of Amenmesse and Seti II were parallel to one another; Seti II must have initially controlled Thebes in his first and second years during which time his tomb was excavated and partly decorated. Then Seti was ousted from power in Upper Egypt by Amenmesse whose agents desecrated Seti II's tomb. Seti would finally defeat his rival Amenmesse and return to Thebes in triumph whereupon he ordered the restoration of his damaged tomb.|$|E

Second, these subsidies increase over time.

Communication is unreliable in {{the sense}} that the broadcast channel from one agent to its neighbors can drop the event-triggered packets of information, where the transmitting agent is unaware that the packet was not received and the receiving agents have no knowledge of the transmitted packet. Additionally, packets that successfully arrive at their destination may suffer from time-varying communication delays. In this paper, we consider directed graphs, and we also relax the consistency on the packet dropouts and the delays. Relaxing consistency means that the delays and dropouts for a packet broadcast by one agent can be different for each receiving node.
