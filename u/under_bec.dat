We first analyse a convention styled after the OECD's 'Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions', which requires signatory countries to proceed against firms that have bribed public officials of any foreign country. We then study the {{case in which the}} convention requires signatory countries to proceed against firms that have bribed public officials of signatory countries only. We argue that the second type of convention is more likely to ensure the enforcement of penalties.

40|$|This article {{offers an}} {{explanation}} of why firms ’ downsizing pat-terns may vary substantially in magnitude and timing, taking the form of one-time massive cuts, waves of layoffs, or zero layoff policies. The key element of this theory is that workers ’ expectations about their job security affect their on-the-job performance. In a situation where firms face adverse shocks, the productivity effect of job insecu-rity forces firms to balance laying off redundant workers and maintain-ing survivors ’ commitment. The cost of ensuring commitment differs between firms with different characteristics and determines whether workers are laid off all at once or in stages. However, if firms have pri-vate information about their future profits, they may not lay off any workers and raise wages in order to signal a bright future, boosting workers ’ confidence. ∗The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from DGES and FEDER <b>under</b> <b>BEC</b> 2003 - 00412 and Barcelona Economics (CREA).

40|$|Belief {{propagation}} or {{message passing}} on binary erasure channels (BEC) {{is a low}} complexity decoding algorithm that allows the recovery of message symbols based on bipartite graph prunning process. Recently, array XOR codes have attracted attention for storage systems due to their burst error recovery performance and easy arithmetic based on Exclusive OR (XOR) -only logic operations. Array BP-XOR codes are a subclass of array XOR codes that can be decoded using BP <b>under</b> <b>BEC.</b> Requiring the capability of BP-decodability in addition to Maximum Distance Separability (MDS) constraint on the code construction process is observed to put an upper bound on the maximum achievable code block length, {{which leads to the}} code construction process to become a harder problem. In this study, we introduce asymptotically MDS array BP-XOR codes that are alternative to exact MDS array BP-XOR codes {{to pave the way for}} easier code constructions while keeping the decoding complexity low with an asymptotically vanishing coding overhead. We finally provide and analyze a simple code construction method that is based on discrete geometry to fulfill the requirements of the class of asymptotically MDS array BP-XOR codes.

40|$|We {{consider}} the following allocation problem: A fixed number of public facilities must be located on a line. Society is composed of $N$ agents, who must be allocated to one and {{only one of these}} facilities. Agents have single peaked preferences over the possible location of the facilities they are assigned to, and do not care about the location of the rest of facilities. There is no congestion. In this context, we observe that if a public decision is a Condorcet winner, then it satisfies nice properties of internal and external stability. Though in many contexts and for some preference profiles there may be no Condorcet winners, we study the extent to which stability can be made compatible with the requirement of choosing Condorcet winners whenever they exist.
