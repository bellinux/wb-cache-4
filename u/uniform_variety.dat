40|$|There is {{a general}} {{perception}} that modern agroecosystems have a negative biodiversity impact. The adverse implications are a reflection of modern varieties being bred from a narrow circle of parental genetic material and of {{the high level of}} genetic uniformity of the varieties. Existing literature suggests that the adoption of low-diversity agroecosystems is favoured because of possibilities of exploiting scale economies from the use of standard tools and knowledge. This trajectory of development is subsequently globalised because of path dependency and lock-in effects. The paper sheds a novel insight on this issue by historically examining the breeding of genetically <b>uniform</b> <b>varieties.</b> Institutional factors, like intellectual property rights, that reinforce the bias towards genetic uniformity are also examined.

40|$|International audienceThe diet of Pomatoschistus microps {{has been}} studied using both gut content and stable isotope analyses. In the Roscoff Aber Bay (Brittany, France), this fish is {{commonly}} found on sandy muddy intertidal flats. Gut content analyses were also interpreted using trophic indices. Owing to the large diversity of prey consumed, these indices emphasised the opportunistic feeding behaviour of P. microps. Here, this species fed mainly on endofauna with meiofauna being of high relative importance. The main biotic components of its trophic habitat, characterized by C- 13 and N- 15, provided evidence of a major trophic pathway based on drift Enteromorpha sp. Trophic positions estimated by both diet analyses and isotopic analyses led to similar results. In this bay, P. microps is a first-order predator with a low degree of omnivory.

In this work, we propose an information-theoretic approach to geographic language variation using a corpus based on Twitter. We test our models with tens of concepts and their associated keywords detected in Spanish tweets geolocated in Spain. We employ dialectometric measures (cosine similarity and Jensen-Shannon divergence) to quantify the linguistic distance on the lexical level between cells created in a uniform grid over the map. This can be done for a single concept or in the general case taking into account an average of the considered variants. The latter permits an analysis of the dialects that naturally emerge from the data. Interestingly, our results reveal the existence of two dialect macrovarieties. The first group includes a region-specific speech spoken in small towns and rural areas whereas the second cluster encompasses cities that tend to use a more <b>uniform</b> <b>variety.</b> Since the results obtained with the two different metrics qualitatively agree, our work suggests that social media corpora can be efficiently used for dialectometric analyses.

40|$|In {{the long}} process of {{normalization}} undergone by the English language in the early modern period the printing press is generally considered {{to have been a}} highly influential contributing factor. Most of the early presses were set up in Westminster-London and they printed mainly books in the vernacular at comparatively affordable prices. By so doing, they added to the recognition and diffusion of the incipient national standard based on the mixed language of the capital. Albert Baugh and Thomas Cable summarize the linguistic impact of the printing press in the following terms “ A powerful force thus existed for promoting a standard, uniform language, and the means were now available for spreading that language throughout the territory in which it was understood. ” (1978 : 200) The early printers, however, were not linguistic reformers and the study of the texts they pro-duced shows them on the whole not to be above their most enlightened contemporaries as far as variation in language is concerned (Scragg 1974, Gómez Soliño 1984, 1985, 1986). Early Modern Standard English was far from being a <b>uniform</b> <b>variety</b> and, though to a lesser degree than manuscripts, the printed books of that period are not exempt from variant spellings, often phonologically motivated and thus ultimately dialectal in origin (Wyld 1920, Dobson 1955) ...|$|E
40|$|Published online: 05 October 2011 Multi-environment trials (METs) in West Africa have {{demonstrated}} the existence of genotype×environment interactions (G×E), which complicate the selection of superior cultivars and the best testing sites for identifying superior and stable genotypes. Two powerful statistical tools available for MET analysis are the additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) and the genotype main effect+G×E (known as GGE) biplot. The objective {{of the present study}} was to compare their effectiveness in identifying maize mega-environments and stable and superior maize cultivars with good adaptation to West Africa. Twelve extra-early maturing maize cultivars were evaluated at 17 locations in four countries in West Africa from 2006 to 2009. The effects of genotype (G), environments (E) and G×E were significant (P< 0 01) for grain yield. Differences between E accounted for 0 75 of the total variation in the sum of squares for grain yield, whereas the G effects accounted for 0 03 and G×E for 0 22. The GGE biplot explained 0 74 of total variations in the sum of squares for grain yield and revealed three mega-environments and seven cultivar groups. The AMMI graph explained 0 13 and revealed four groups each of environments and cultivars. The two procedures provided similar results in terms of stability and performance of the cultivars. Both methods identified the cultivars 2004 TZEE-W Pop STR C 4 and TZEE-W Pop STR C 4 as superior across environments. Cultivar 2004 TZEE-W Pop STR C 4 was the most stable. The GGE biplot was more versatile and flexible, and provided a better understanding of G×E than the AMMI graph.

40|$|Drumhead Quarry, {{situated}} a few kilometres north-east of Denny in the Central Belt of Scotland, is one {{of several}} quarries in the Falkirk area which exploited the Cowie Rock, a pale-coloured sandstone in the Upper Limestone Formation (Clackmannan Group). The quarry supplied building stone from the very early 18 th century, working fairly consistently until the late 19 th century. Historical evidence indicates that the stone was primarily used locally in the Falkirk and Stirling areas, until the opening of the Union Canal in 1822 which then allowed the sandstone to be shipped to Glasgow, Linlithgow and Edinburgh, mainly for use as paving stone. Drumhead sandstone was the first ever shipment along the Union Canal in 1822, landing in Edinburgh. The quarry was worked under several different operators throughout the 19 th century and often shared the same operator as Thorneydyke Quarry (located c. 600 m to the north) {{in the latter half of}} the 1800 s. It was not uncommon for the quarry to be operated by local builders and architects, who were most likely to use the stone they were extracting from their own quarry as the main source of building material for their designed and built structures. Drumhead Quarry exposes thick-bedded sandstone with some bedding lamination and wide joint spacing, well-suited to extracting large blocks. The possibility that a unit of limestone - the Calmy Limestone - encroaches near to the quarry‘s east and north boundaries (and might limit the prospects for future expansion) has been recently tested by drilling boreholes. Limestone was not encountered in the drilling exercise, but units of mudstone and shale interbedded with sandstone to the east of the quarry indicate a change in the depositional environment of the sedimentary rocks in this area, and suggest the limestone might be nearby. A borehole to the north of the quarry encountered only sandstone in the bedrock, hence extending the quarry in this direction would appear to offer the best prospect of encountering good reserves of sandstone. Samples of Drumhead sandstone are quartz-rich, well compacted, and have a strong natural mineral cement resulting in a strongly cohesive (difficult to disaggregate) stone. The stone is therefore of good quality and likely to be durable. It has the potential to be a versatile building stone, suited to a range of uses including rubble walling, high quality ashlar and carving. There are two main varieties of the sandstone: a buff variety with faint-to-strong bedding lamination, and an off-white, freestone (<b>uniform)</b> <b>variety.</b> All of these factors will enhance the commercial viability of the stone. The two varieties of Drumhead stone should provide a good substitute for a number of sandstones that were formerly sourced and used widely in the Central Belt, but are now unavailable.

The germplasm was collected from Punjab and N. W. F. Province of Pakistan in 1994 and evaluated for morpho-physiological traits under field conditions at Tsukuba, Japan during 1995 and 1996. Thirty-five phenotypic traits were recorded for all accessions from seedling emergence till crop harvest. A considerable level of genetic variation was observed among all tested accessions for various traits. However, most of the germplasm collections from Pakistan shared similar morphology with one another when compared with the leafy vegetable cultivars from Japan. Seedling characteristics showed less variation, while the largest variation was found for flowering and maturity stage characters. Generally, low correlation was observed among different traits, however, some of the related characters were significantly correlated with each other. The results indicated that oilseed mustard in Pakistan has narrow genetic base and experiencing high level of genetic erosion perhaps due to selection for similar traits, replacement by new <b>uniform</b> <b>varieties</b> and socio-economic changes in agriculture.

40|$|Awareness of {{the need}} for {{biodiversity}} conservation is now universally accepted, but most often recent conservation activities have focused on wild species. Crop species and the diversity between and within them has significant socioeconomic as well as heritage value. The bulk of genetic diversity in domesticated species is located in traditional varieties maintained by traditional farming systems. These traditional varieties, commonly referred to as landraces, are severely threatened by genetic extinction primarily due to their replacement by modern genetically <b>uniform</b> <b>varieties.</b> The conservation of landrace diversity has been hindered in part by the lack of an accepted definition to define the entity universally recognized as landraces. Without a definition {{it would be impossible to}} prepare an inventory and without an inventory changes in landrace constituency could not be recognized over time. Therefore, based on a literature review, workshop discussion and interviews with key informants, common characteristics of landraces were identified, such as: historical origin, high genetic diversity, local genetic adaptation, recognizable identity, lack of formal genetic improvement, and whether associated with traditional farming systems. However, although these characteristics are commonly present they are not always all present for any individual landrace; several crop-specific exceptions were noted relating to crop propagation method (sexual or asexual), breeding system (self-fertilized or cross-fertilized species), length of formal crop improvement, seed management (selection or random propagation) and use. This paper discusses the characteristics that generally constitute a landrace, reviews the exceptions to these characteristics and provides a working definition of a landrace. The working definition proposed is as follows: `a landrace is a dynamic population(s) of a cultivated plant that has historical origin, distinct identity and lacks formal crop improvement, as well as often being genetically diverse, locally adapted and associated with traditional farming systems...|$|R
40|$|Analysis of viral and {{bacterial}} pathogenesis {{has revealed}} common {{themes in the}} ways in which plants and animals respond to pathogenic agents. Pathogenic bacteria use macromolecule delivery systems (types III and IV) to deliver microbial avirulence proteins and transfer DNA-protein complexes directly into plant cells. The molecular events that constitute critical steps of plant-pathogen interactions seem to involve ligand-receptor mechanisms for pathogen recognition and the induction of signal transduction pathways in the plant that lead to defense responses. Unraveling the molecular basis of disease resistance pathways has laid a foundation for the rational design of crop protection strategies. Since the onset of civilization, plant dis-eases have had catastrophic effects on crops and the well-being of human popu-lations. For example, the fungus Phytoph-thora infestans caused the epidemic that triggered the Irish potato famine of the 1840 s. Infectious plant diseases continue to cause human suffering and enormous economic losses. An increasing human population and decreasing amounts of land available for agriculture make all ap-proaches to securing the world food supply critical. Protection of crops from disease can substantially improve agricultural pro-duction. Although pesticides have suc-cessfully controlled disease, their contin-ued and increasing use will have harmful effects on our health and the environ-ment. Use of high-yield crop varieties can also improve productivity, but carries a risk—such genetically <b>uniform</b> <b>varieties</b> cultivated over enormous areas are suscep-tible to devastating epidemics. Thoughtful application of the plant’s own defense mechanisms, combined with understand-ing of the complex ecology of real-world disease processes, can lead to more effec-tive protection against plant pathogens.

The procedure lifts functorially to the generated varieties and leads, under specified sufficient conditions, to a categorical equivalence between these varieties. When these conditions are satisfied, a very tight algebraic relationship exists between the base variety and the enriched variety. Moreover varieties arising as duplicates of a common base variety are automatically categorically equivalent to each other. Two further product representation constructions are also presented; these {{are in the same}} spirit as our main theorem and extend the scope of our analysis. Our catalogue of applications selects varieties for which product representations have previously been obtained one by one, or which are new.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to use a soybean crop model to estimate the difference in net return between variable–rate and uniform–rate management for soybean plant population and variety selection decisions. The CROPGRO–Soybean model was calibrated to fit three seasons of historical yield data in 77 grids within a 20 –ha field infested with soybean cyst nematodes (SCN) in central Iowa. Procedures were developed to compute the net return and break–even cost for variable plant population density and variety selection for SCN management using 34 years of historical weather data. Implementing the best population (VRX) for each year produced higher net returns compared to using the 34 –year average optimum rate (VRA) or using uniform management (UM). Achieving maximum possible net return under VRX may not be possible on a yearly basis due to uncertainties in weather condition. Risk–averse farmers, however, may opt to use the realistic 34 –year average optimum rate (VRA) that provides favorable net return over the long term. Procedures were also developed to determine gross profit and break–even costs for switching SCN–resistant and susceptible varieties within an SCN–infested field. Using an SCN–resistant variety across the entire field resulted in significant net returns over that of a susceptible variety, and there appeared to be no economic advantage for variable variety selection compared to planting a <b>uniform</b> resistant <b>variety</b> across the field...|$|R
40|$|Like {{the data}} {{migration}} research community, {{the field of}} multiple service integration is confronted with legacy systems. Despite of the new interfaces providing <b>uniform</b> access to <b>variety</b> of information (e. g. WWW, Gopher), plenty of information is still accessed using interactive services with textual interfaces. The lucky case are interfaces based on DEC's VT 100 or IBM's 3270 standards. To allow access to interactive services, the straight forward solution was the introduction of special URI-Schemes (telnet, rlogin and tn 3270). Nevertheless is the user forced to fight a new interface almost every time he hits an interactive session. We introduce a translation server to allow easier access to interactive sessions. Keywords: Multiple service integration, legacy systems, World Wide Web (WWW), interactive session, textual interface, translation server. Open Questions: More examples of legacy systems with textual interfaces? How much can be covered using translation servers? How to define [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|However, in general, {{most large}} police {{departments}} provide officers with {{two types of}} uniforms for wear, tactical (also called [...] "Class B"), and traditional (or [...] "Class A"). Tactical uniforms - similar in material and cut to the U.S. Army's former battle dress uniform - are generally worn while on patrol, or performing physically intense duties, while traditional-style uniforms are more often used for station assignments, high profile events, and ceremonial functions. [...] In addition to these two basic <b>uniform</b> types, a <b>variety</b> of specialized clothing may be deployed as necessary, including jumpsuits (sometimes called [...] "Class C") and - {{in the case of}} police pipe bands - highland dress. Many police departments restrict the use of tactical uniforms to tactical units, such as SWAT teams, or for special assignments, such as riot control, in order to present a less militarized appearance in day-to-day operations.|$|R
