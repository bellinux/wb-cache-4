5|$|By late 1943, Miller {{has been}} based at RAF South Cerny in Gloucestershire. One night, he was pulled over by his {{commanding}} officer, whom he detested, for not wearing his <b>uniform</b> <b>cap.</b> An altercation resulted, and Miller posed {{as though he were}} about to punch his officer. The result was that Miller was charged with insubordination and sentenced to a three-week disciplinary course with hard labour, from 18 October to 9 November. In mid-November he was posted to Ouston near Newcastle upon Tyne where he was trained in the use of radar using Anson and Oxford aircraft. During his stay there, Miller was thrown on his back during a wrestling match, sustaining an injury that caused him recurring problems in later years, diminishing his ability to bowl.|$|E

60|$|The Corporal, a smart {{figure of}} a man of thirty, perhaps a thought under the middle size, but very neatly made,--a sunburnt Corporal with a brown peaked beard,--faced about at the moment, {{addressing}} voluble words of instruction to the squad in hand. Nothing was amiss or awry about the Corporal. A lithe and nimble Corporal, quite complete, from the sparkling dark eyes under his knowing <b>uniform</b> <b>cap</b> to his sparkling white gaiters. The very image and presentment of a Corporal of his country's army, {{in the line of}} his shoulders, the line of his waist, the broadest line of his Bloomer trousers, and their narrowest line at the calf of his leg.|$|E
60|$|Neither Jacinta nor Austin {{seemed to}} hear her. They were both {{watching}} Macallister, and he, at least, clearly intended to accost the clerics. He was now dressed immaculately in blue uniform, {{and in that}} condition he was a big, handsome man, {{but he was also}} a North British Calvinist, so far as he had any religious views at all, and accordingly not one who could reasonably be expected to do homage to a dignitary of Rome. Still, the little fleshy priest was a friend of his, and when the latter presented him he bent one knee a trifle and gravely took off his <b>uniform</b> <b>cap.</b> The ecclesiastic raised two fingers and spoke in Latin. Macallister smiled at him reassuringly.|$|E

Their badge is oval with an eagle on top, in contrast to the shield worn by police officers. School Safety vehicles are either dark blue with white decals or white with light blue decals.|$|R

The three fellows who had been skylarking when I came in were now talking {{together}} very soberly, and the long-necked chap {{was going on with}} his writing still. He seemed to me the most dangerous of the lot. I saw him side-face and his lips were set very tight. I had never looked at mankind in that light before. When one's young human nature shocks one. But what startled me most was to see the door I had come through open slowly and give passage to a head in a <b>uniform</b> <b>cap</b> with a Board of Trade badge. It was that blamed old doorkeeper from the hall. He had run me to earth and meant to dig me out too. He walked up the office smirking craftily, cap in hand.|$|E

"I {{pushed down}} some of the parapet where I had been sitting, dropped my cap on the edge outside, so as to make it appear that I had fallen over, and then picking up the man's turban, ran {{to the other end of}} the {{platform}} and scrambled down to the ledge. Then I began to wave my arms about--I had nothing on above the waist--and in a moment I saw a face with a <b>uniform</b> <b>cap</b> peer out through the jungle, and a hand was waved. I made signs to him to make his way to the foot of the perpendicular wall of rock beneath me. I then unwound the turban, whose length was, I knew, amply sufficient to reach to the bottom, and then looked round for something to write on. I had my pencil still in my trousers pocket, but not a scrap of paper.|$|E

5|$|In the First World War, firing and {{observation}} positions were hand-painted in disruptive patterns by artists known as camoufleurs, and they sometimes varied their patterns seasonally. Uniforms were largely {{of a single}} colour, such as the British khaki; but snow camouflage clothes came into use in some armies by 1917. For example, Austro-Hungarian troops on the Italian front used skis and wore snow camouflage smocks and overtrousers over their uniforms, and improvised white cloths over their <b>uniform</b> <b>caps.</b>|$|R

50|$|Airline pilot uniform shirts {{generally}} include cloth flattened tubular epaulettes having cloth or bullion braid stripes, attached by {{shoulder straps}} {{integral to the}} shirts. The rank of the wearer is designated {{by the number of}} stripes: Traditionally four for captain, three for first officer (copilot), two for second officer (flight engineer). However, rank insignia are airline specific. For example, at some airlines, two stripes denote junior first officer and one stripe second officer (cruise or relief pilot). Airline captains' <b>uniform</b> <b>caps</b> usually will have a braid pattern on the bill.|$|R
