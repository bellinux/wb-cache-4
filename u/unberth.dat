25|$|Flight day 3 saw {{the docking}} of Endeavour to the Pressurized Mating Adapter (PMA) 2 on the ISS. The docking {{occurred}} on 18 May 2011 at 10:14 UTC. After the shuttle docked, the six astronauts of STS-134 joined the Expedition 27 crew {{on board the}} ISS. The joint crews completed a series of leak checks and opened the hatches at 11:38 UTC. Once the hatches were open, the joint crew held a welcome ceremony and completed a safety briefing. The first task for the joint crew was to <b>unberth</b> the Express Logistics Carrier (ELC) 3, and attach it to its final location on the ISS's Port 3 (P3) truss segment. Express Logistics Carrier 3 {{was removed from the}} payload bay of Endeavour by the SRMS and handed off to the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS), also known as Canadarm2. The ELC 3 was finally installed at 16:18 UTC. Kelly began to transfer oxygen from space shuttle Endeavour to the ISS. Mike Fincke and Drew Feustel transferred the two Extravehicular Mobility Units (EMU) to the ISS's Quest Airlock in preparation for their use during the mission's four spacewalks.|$|E
2500|$|On 24 February 2016, the Suez Canal Authority officially {{opened the}} new side channel. This side channel, {{located at the}} {{northern}} side of the east extension of the Suez Canal, serves the East Terminal for berthing and unberthing vessels from the terminal. [...] As the East Container Terminal {{is located on the}} Canal itself, before the construction of the new side channel {{it was not possible to}} berth or <b>unberth</b> vessels at the terminal while the convoy was running.|$|E
50|$|After midday, Reisman and Sellers used Canadarm2 to <b>unberth</b> the OBSS {{from the}} sill of Atlantis cargo bay {{and handed it}} off to the shuttle's robotic arm, {{operated}} by Ham and Antonelli.|$|E
40|$|Shipmasters {{may have}} to perform <b>unberthing</b> without tugboat {{assistance}} when a tsunami warning is issued. Keeping this in mind, we studied emergency <b>unberthing</b> without tug assistance by conducting numerical simulations and full-mission ship maneuvering simulator (SMS) experiments. A panamax class medium-sized bulker and a pure car carrier (PCC) were used as test ships. In the experiments, we established the limitations of basic shiphandling techniques such as stern kick out, backing, and accelerating turn in windy conditions using a mathematical modeling group (MMG) -type mathematical maneuvering model. On {{the basis of the}} results, we produced a shiphandling scenario and evaluated it using SMS experiments. We concluded that <b>unberthing</b> without tug assistance in 5 m/s onshore winds is possible. Furthermore, the use of thrusters can greatly reduce the time required for <b>unberthing...</b>|$|R

50|$|Maneuvering a ship {{through the}} shallow water to berth / <b>unberth</b> in a port {{requires}} teamwork which involves, apart from the port pilot, the ship's captain (jointly responsible), ship's crew, port tugs, and shore linesmen. Since the pilot is on board the ship, he controls the tugs and linesmen through a radio and the ship directly. The ship's captain ensures his crew carry out the pilot's orders.|$|E

50|$|NASA {{announced}} on 1 June {{its intention to}} <b>unberth</b> Cygnus a month ahead of schedule. In preparation for unberthing, Cygnus was grappled by Canadarm2 on 2 June. Early on 4 June, the bolts securing Cygnus to the station were retracted, and Canadarm2 unberthed the spacecraft at 11:05 UTC. Crew members aboard the station maneuvered Cygnus to its release attitude, and at 13:10 UTC the vehicle was released from Canadarm2. One minute later, Cygnus began carrying {{out a series of}} departure burns to move it away from the ISS.|$|E

2500|$|On flight day 11 the MPLM Leonardos hatches {{were closed}} at 07:38 UTC (03:38 EDT) and the MPLM was <b>unberthed</b> from the nadir or earth facing port of the Harmony node at 20:24 UTC (16:24 EDT). It {{was placed in}} a low hover, about [...] above shuttle Discoverys payload bay. This was done because the MPLM was <b>unberthed</b> from Harmony later than planned. The delay in <b>unberthing</b> was caused by a set of bolts on the Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM) getting stuck due to a broken pin. The crew will finish putting Leonardo in the payload bay on flight day 12, prior to the docked late inspection. The crews {{conducted}} some transfer operations between the ISS and shuttle mid-deck, which brings the overall transfer operations to ninety-four percent complete for the mission.|$|R
50|$|In {{preparation}} for <b>unberthing,</b> REBR and i-Ball reentry data recorders were installed and activated, and the hatch was closed on September 11.|$|R
50|$|On 22 October the Canadarm2 {{was used}} to <b>unberth</b> the Cygnus {{spacecraft}} from the nadir port of the Harmony module at 10:04 UTC. The spacecraft was then maneuvered to a release position below the station, where it {{was released from the}} RMS at 11:31 UTC. It then performed a series of separation maneuvers away from the station. The spacecraft fired its main engine to de-orbit itself on 23 October at 17:41 UTC, with reentry and burning up in the atmosphere over the southern Pacific Ocean occurring at 18:16 UTC.|$|E
5000|$|On flight day 5, {{the crew}} {{focused on the}} {{addition}} of the MRM-1 module to the space station. Commander Ken Ham and pilot Tony Antonelli maneuvered Atlantis robotic arm to <b>unberth</b> MRM-1 from the shuttle's payload bay at 09:49 UTC, and handed it off to the station's Canadarm2 at 10:14 UTC. Mission Specialists Garrett Reisman and Piers Sellers, working from inside the station's Cupola, then maneuvered the Canadarm2 arm to deliver MRM-1 to its new position, the Earth-facing port of the Zarya service module. The docking occurred at 12:20 UTC when the shuttle-station stack was flying above Argentina. Following the successful docking, Sellers reported to Mission Control that, during the docking, he did not see the expected [...] "capture 1" [...] confirmation signal appear on his laptop, to which CAPCOM Steve Swanson replied [...] "And station, that error's expected. The reason you didn't get 'contact 1' is because Garrett did too good of a job flying. He went right down the middle and got a hole in one." ...|$|E

50|$|The port {{itself is}} an open water port and the Cape Lambert wharf is exposed to strong cross {{currents}} due up to over 5 metres of tidal movement. Six RA Star 3200 tugs are used by the facility to assist vessels in berthing and <b>unberthing</b> operations.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, ships can berth and <b>unberth</b> {{under their}} own power with {{increasing}} ships maneuvering capability and high power engines. So, propeller jets causes erosion near quay walls and around the piers and this causes serious damages to harbor structures. For this reason, to obtain the jet velocity distribution besides the pile and quay walls becomes very important problem for the designers. In this study, the circular jet was used to simulate the propeller jet and the velocity distributions of a submerged circular jet flow around a pile in an equilibrium scour hole were investigated experimentally.

40|$|The study {{evaluated}} the training effectiveness of an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) for the Remote Manipulator System (RMS). The study examined how well individuals learn the training content and skills from the RMS ITS {{and to what}} extent the content and skills learned using the ITS transfer to RMS task performance in the SES, a high fidelity simulator. Three astronauts completed 8 2 -hour ITS sessions addressing movement in three coordinate systems, grapple, ungrapple, berth, and <b>unberth</b> procedures, and singularities and reach limits. Their performance was also observed in an SES training session. Performance data were collected using multiple measures: ITS task performance, transfer performance on the SES, a conceptual knowledge test, an opinion survey completed by astronauts, and comments and observations from astronauts and trainers. Results indicated the RMS ITS to be moderately effective and provided evidence of the efficacy of ITS's, in general. Comments and suggestions are provided relating to how the ITS could be improved and to enable decision makers to judge the effectiveness of the RMS ITS...|$|E
