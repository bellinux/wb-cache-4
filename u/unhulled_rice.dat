The objectives ofstudy were (i) to describe the channel of rice marketing, (ii) to analyze thecomponents of cost and marketing margin in each agent of marketing link, and (iii) toidentify the characteristics and problems in each agent of marketing link. The methodof Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) was used in this study using Snow Ball Pointwhere the farmers were placed as a start point. Primary data were collected from 50 farmers, 20 traders, 4 village rice mills, and 10 rice consumers. Secondary data werecollected from Agriculture office, Institutions for Agricultural Research, and others. The results informed that, in North Sumatra there were found two channels of ricemarketing. First, farmers sell direct <b>unhulled</b> <b>rice</b> to collecting merchant thencollecting merchant sells them to large merchant (kilang). In kilang, <b>unhulled</b> <b>rice</b> isprocessed to become hulled rice then sold them to wholesalers and retailer to be soldto consumers. Second, farmers sell <b>unhulled</b> <b>rice</b> to local rice mill. In rice mill,unhulled rice is processed to become hulled rice then sold them to retailer to be soldto consumers. In the first channel, the most marketing margin happened at kilangequal to Rp. 216,- with net benefit margin of Rp. 89,-/kg. In the secondary channel themost marketing margin and net benefit margin happened at the village rice mill equalto Rp. 210,- and Rp. 85,-/kg respectively.

In Exp. 1, the effect of 24 cereals vs. a common reference diet containing white rice on feed preference in pigs was studied. Pigs were offered free choice between the reference diet and a diet with the cereal under study for 4 d. Barley, corn (2 sources), wheat, cassava meal, biscuit meal, rye, sorghum, and 1 source of oats were tested at inclusion rates of 300 and 600 g-kg- 1. Shortgrain rice (whole, brown, or extruded white), long-grain white rice (raw and cooked), extruded barley, extruded corn, extruded wheat, oats (2 sources), thick rolled oats, cooked oats, and naked oats (raw, extruded, or micronized) were tested at inclusion rates of 150, 300, and 600 g-kg- 1. Relative preference of cereals (% of total feed intake) was affected by type of cereal and by rate of inclusion. The diets containing extruded rice (150 g·kg- 1), extruded naked oats (150, 300, and 600 g·kg- 1), or naked oats (150 and 300 g·kg- 1) were preferred (P < 0. 05) by pigs to the reference diet. However, the reference diet was preferred (P < 0. 05) to the diets containing 150, 300, and 600 g·kg- 1 of cooked long-grain rice, oats, or cooked oats, 300 and 600 g·kg- 1 of extruded wheat, wheat, corn, sorghum, or <b>unhulled</b> short-grain <b>rice,</b> and 600 g·kg- 1 of thick rolled oats, extruded corn, rye, extruded barley, micronized naked oats, barley, cassava, or biscuit meal. Extrusion improved (P < 0. 05) preference values for corn and naked oats by pigs, but {{had no effect on}} barley, rice, or wheat. In Exp. 2, the preferences of pigs for oats and barley were studied using mash and pelleted diets. Diet form did not affect preference in oats diets. However, for barley, greater preference values were obtained when measured in pelleted form compared with mash form. Additionally, direct 2 -way choices were also performed between oats and barley diets and between diets presented in mash and pelleted forms. Pigs preferred barley to oats, and preferred diets presented in pelleted form to those presented in mash form. In conclusion, cereal type, inclusion rate, and diet form affected feed preference in pigs. Using cereals with greater preference values may contribute to the formulation of more palatable feeds, which enhance feed intake of piglets at critical stages such as weaning time...|$|R

Farmers and traders prefer to sell wet grain rather than dried grain of <b>unhulled</b> <b>rice</b> due to less attractive incentive {{for them to do}} drying. The study was conducted in Subang District, West Java, during March-June 2011 using survey method to analyze the financial feasibility of rice dryers. The respondents interviewed were 15 rice millers who have either sun-drying floor or mechanical dryer, or both. The main collected data were the investment cost, operational cost, maintenance cost, and the revenue of the dryers. The data were analyzed by using shortterm and long-term financial analyses to assess the profitability and feasibility of some drying technologies. The results showed that there were at least three drying technologies in the study area, namely sun-drying floor, flatbed dryer using gas fuel (gas dryer), and flatbed dryer using rice husk fuel (husk dryer). Under the mean capacity, the short-run MBCR of technological change from sun dryer to gas dryer was 1. 29, while from sun dryer to husk dryer was 1. 45. The long-run analysis showed that the IRRs were 44. 44 % for sun dryer, 233. 47 % for gas dryer, and 260. 49 % for husk dryer.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Fogera Woreda, South Gondar Zone of the Amhara National Regional State with the objectives of on-farm evaluation of urea treated straw and rice bran supplementation on milk yield and composition of Fogera cows. The area has high potential for rice production and is native origin of Fogera cattle breed. Despite the high production potentials, improvements in utilization system for feeding rice straw to livestock are not properly addressed. As a result, assessment of the potentials, opportunities and effects of urea treated rice straw and rice bran on milk yield and composition was required to serve as a basis for the better development of these feeds as potential feed resources for milk production. To address these issues, a single-visit-multiple-subject survey was carried out and 120 rural households who were individually interviewed with structured and semi structured questionnaires. Twenty Fogera cows used for the feeding trial were blocked on weight and milk yield bases having an initial mean body weight of 259. 75 ± 33. 8 and milk yield of 1. 23 ± 0. 26. The treatments were grazing + untreated rice straw(T 1), grazing +urea treated rice straw (T 2), grazing +urea treated rice straw + rice bran (T 3), and grazing +urea treated rice straw + formulated concentrate mix (T 4). The survey result in the study area revealed that 44, 223 tons of <b>unhulled</b> <b>rice</b> grain, 38, 603 tons of rice straw dry matter, and 4, 422 tons of rice bran, respectively were produced in 2008. And the on farm feed supplementation has resulted in a mean milk yield of 1. 2 kg/cow/day in T 1, and 2. 36, 2. 48, and 2. 63 kg/cow/day in T 2, T 3, and T 4, respectively. The partial budget analysis indicated a daily income of 4. 20, 6. 82, 6. 50, and 6. 59 ETB, where, T 1 was lesser by a net profit of 2. 62, 2. 30, and 2. 39 over T 2, T 3, and T 4 respectively. This indicates that supplementary feeding of urea treated straw and rice bran had significant contribution to the development of dairy business in the study area.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of the present study}} are : (1) to identify levels of interest among stakeholders in the gabah (<b>unhulled</b> <b>rice</b> grain) production network in Karawang Regency, West Java, (2) to formulate determining factors {{in the development of a}} community participation network in the gabah production, (3) to devise an archetypal network which has the potential to increase farmers' income in the region. Among the important findings of the study were as follows. The relationships amongst stakeholders are affected by several factors, including common needs, trust, sense of communal togetherness, similarities in task and functions among public and private institutions. These relationships act as a structure for a community participation network in the gabah business in Karawang Regency. Using TOWS, the present study examine the external and internal environment of the network to produce 4 strategies to enable the development of a community participation network, as follows: (1) empowerment of Farmers Community Cooperatives, (2) application of post-harvest technology, (3) creation of a central market, (4) improvement of farmers/competencies and empowerment of the Village Unit Cooperative. To determine the development priority, a QSPM (quantitative strategic planning matrix) is utilised to obtain a total of highest AS (attractive scores). The matrix indicates that the Farmers Community Cooperative has the highest score of 6, 22 in case of strategy, therefore it should be prioritised. The present study suggests that the community participation network in the gabah business should develop a strategy to empower the Farmers Labour Cooperatives (KKT) by focussing on stakeholders that has very strong relationship in the gabah bussiness to KKT. The Farmers Labour Cooperatives (KKT) could be an instrument for the farmers to provide a value-added gabah business. The Karawang Local Government, through its Agricultural Regional Office, could act as a server for the network, providing technical information on agribusiness for the KKT and the Poktan. The above suggestion underlines the importance of the acquirement of collective means of production, credit facilities for farmers, legitimation of the KKT as corporate bodies, and debt management. Last but not least, it is suggested that a further study be conducted on the feasibility of the development of e-farmers and ecommerce based on the existing community participation network. ...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objects in}} this survey were {{to find out whether}} the Japanese mice, Mus molossinus Temminck and Schlegel, live out in the several environments all the year, and whether they have a {{breeding}} season in such different habitats as house, straw stack, cultivated field and waste land. For this reseach the capture of the mice, confirmation of their nest holes, examination on the reproductive status and feeding habit were all carried out in Fukuoka District between June 1955 and April 1960 (Figs. 1 - 5). The trapping for capture of the mice was all done with break-back traps and cage traps baited with a dumpling made of wheat and buckwheat flours or a piece of cheese. The methods I have used for information on the reproductive status were the examination of implantation scars, corpora lutea, presence or absence of embryos and stage of oestrus cycle as determined by vaginal smears regarding the female, on the other hand, spermatozoa in smears of epididymides regarding the male. The results are shown in Tables 1 - 8 {{on the basis of the}} examination on 929 mice (females 402; males 403; young and subadults 124) and on nest holes from all kinds of environments : The mice living in the house take groceries as the food, and breed from spring to autumn. But it is clear that very little breeding occurs in winter. In the farm-house, compost and straw stacks adjoining farm-gardens or grass- and weed-grown areas mice were known to have moved from inside to field owing to the feeding. Such the first movement from inside to field occurred in spring, early summer and fall, and the reverse movement was in winter and rainy season. However the mice dwelling in the urban premises are confined to houses all the year. The food of the mice dwelling in the straw stacks is <b>unhulled</b> <b>rice</b> in winter. Straw stacks in this country are built in the end of November after harvest and these are removed by June of the following year. There is, therefore, the breeding season during winter and spring of the following year. At the beginning of winter the mice living in the fields migrate into straw stacks for the winter season. During autumn the mice are found both around straw stacks adjoining the farm-garden and at considerable distances away from farm-garden. The latter probably lives quite independently in the fields. Since the food has been eaten out at the beginning of spring, they moved from straw stacks to the cultivated field. At the end of spring (the rice planting season) mass of the mice in the straw stacks and the other places spread into the dry slopes of hillacks, high banks of paddy fields and farm-gardens. Most mice living in cultivated field live mainly in the farm-garden and marginal banks of paddy fields in summer. They are living on crops, weed seeds and blades. They can live without the shelters such as houses, compost and straw stacks in winter. They live in burrows in the ground at all seasons. Although they seem to have breeding season all the year round, the rates of fecundity in spring and autumn are higher than in the other seasons. The mice living in the waste land live in burrows in the ground under the weed-grown areas and banks, and they are living largely on weed seeds and blades all the year. They seem to have restricted breeding seasons in spring and autumn. 著者は 1955 年 6 月から 1960 年 4 月まで福岡市およびその近郊において環境を異にする 9 地区 11 カ所を選び(第 1 ～ 5 図),日本産野棲ハツカネズミの棲息場所とその繁殖について検討してみた. 調査の方法としては本種の捕獲,巣孔の確認,食性および生殖状態の吟味などを行なつた. 以下その結果を要約してみたい(第 1 ～ 8 表). まず家屋内に棲息している木種は食品を餌として周年ここに棲み,春夏秋によく繁殖している. 家屋付近に野菜畑や草場があれば時に採餌のため屋外にでて活動する. 一般に藁積は 11 月下旬につくられ,翌年の 5 月下旬には取り除かれる. したがつて藁積に棲む本種は初冬から晩春にみられる. 藁積では主に籾を餌として冬および春ともに繁殖する. 野菜畑を近くにひかえた藁積には本種が多数棲みつき,春には藁積から採餌のため畑にでて活動する. 時に本種は野菜畑から遠く離れたところに棲むこともある. 耕地では作物が畑に繁茂している間は作物を餌としてここに周年穴居するが,付近に家屋や堆肥,藁積があれば,これに移り棲むことがある. とくに梅雨季,冬季においてこのような現象が観察された. また水田地においては夏は土手に棲む. 耕地でも繁殖状態にあるものは周年みられるが,とくに春と秋とに多い. 原野に棲む本種は雑草の茎葉,種実を餌として周年土中に穴居または雑草中に棲息する. その繁殖ははつきり春秋に限られる. 要するに人間社会から離れた孤立地区に棲息する原始生活型の本種は雑草の茎葉と種実を餌として土中に穴居し,その繁殖現象には春と秋の明瞭な 2 つの繁殖季節を留めている. これに反し,一般に人間の生活領域に入つてきている本種は餌や棲息場所を人間に依存し,周年にわたつて繁殖可能となり,明確な繁殖季節を認めがたい. このことは環境としての棲息場所が本種の繁殖現象にいかに大きな影響を与えているかを充分に物語るものである...|$|E
