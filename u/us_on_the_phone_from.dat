40|$|Can we {{guess who}} is calling <b>us</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> before picking up, and does {{local sidereal time}} (LST) affect how often we guess right? Reviews of {{anomalous}} cognition {{studies have shown that}} effect sizes are highest around 13. 30 LST (Spottiswoode, 1997). A post-hoc analysis of telephone telepathy data of Sheldrake (2003) also showed a peak at that time. LST (peak or non-peak) was an independent variable in our prospective telephone telepathy study. Six women who indicated they often experienced telephone telepathy were selected to participate. Each participant chose four close friends or relatives to act as callers. All completed a total of 36 trials; six sessions of six trials each, three sessions at peak time (between 8. 00 and 9. 00 local time) and three at non-peak time (between 17. 30 and 18. 30 local time). One of the experimenters was at the participant’s home during the sessions. The experimenter made sure no irregular communication was going on and logged times of the calls and responses of the participant. At a different location another experimenter used a dice to select a caller about five minutes before the scheduled trial. Then he or she contacted the caller who was asked to call the participant in five minutes and to concentrate his or her thoughts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> participant for the last two minutes before the call was made. When <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> rang at <b>the</b> participant’s home, the participant guessed who she thought was calling before picking up. Analyses show a significant over-all scoring rate of 29. 4 % (p =. 05). Almost all of this effec...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{overview}} of virtual reference {{efforts in the}} library community {{with a focus on}} those that may apply to future IAMSLIC initiatives. Reference services are under constant review and are impacted by ever changing resource delivery methods, e. g. delivery to us in the library. What has relatively recently occurred is an innovation in how we deliver the information we have gathered to the end user or patron who may no longer have to be standing in front of <b>us</b> or <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b> Whether or not IAMSLIC decides to offer a form of virtual reference would not only mean evaluating all the variables any library should consider but a number of questions unique to our organization some of which I will raise in the following discussion. The scope of this paper is only an overview but the references and web page sites I have gathered should expose the reader to the complexity of offering virtual reference service. For clarification purposes I should define some of the terminology that is being used in the discussion of “virtual, ” “online, ” “electronic, ” “e-mail, ” “chat, ” or “ 24 / 7 ” reference service. Virtual, online, and electronic reference can cover the others but the literature...|$|R
