It seeks to acknowledge the state-of-the-art concerning the solutions found {{in the context of}} the information organization systems to value the investment in the use of subject terms in local catalogs at the creation/merger of <b>union</b> <b>catalogs.</b> We conclude that, in the absence of a model that can be applied uniformly to all projects, different solutions should be the result of a collective planning effort to implement an adequate set of measures. It is proposed a recommendation to the networks that will promote the creation of integrated <b>union</b> <b>catalogs</b> in Portugal...|$|R

As of 2007, Northern Regional Library Facility is home to 4.7 million volumes, while SRLF is home to 5.7 million.|$|E
25|$|Kees’s worldview {{and writing}} were shaped by his Jazz Age childhood, and his early {{adulthood}} during the Great Depression. By {{the time he}} {{graduated from high school}} in 1931, he rejected entering the family business and, while at Doane College, decided to become a novelist. It was for this reason that he transferred to the University of Missouri, which had a writing program, and then to the University of Nebraska, where he was mentored by the founding editor of graduating Prairie Schooner, Lowery C. Wimberley. By the time Kees graduated in 1935, he had already written and published short stories in that journal as well as other literary magazine such as Horizon and Rocky Mountain Review. While working for the Federal Writers' Project in Lincoln, Nebraska, and after having suffered the rejection of several novels, Kees turned to writing poetry—and, for a time, engaged in union organizing and considered himself a communist. In 1937, Kees moved to Denver to earn a degree in library science at the University of Denver, which included working as a librarian at the Denver Public Library. He then became director of the Bibliographical Center of Research for the Rocky Mountain Region, which was used as a model for a national <b>union</b> <b>catalog.</b> That same year he married Ann Swan.|$|E

In current conditions of restricted finance and distance from metropolitan countries, consultation and cooperation in serials acquisitions together with <b>union</b> <b>catalogs</b> of serials would be of great value. Modern copying methods make this practical. <b>Union</b> <b>catalogs</b> of monographs would also be valuable.

40|$|This {{study of}} {{resource}} sharing among public libraries {{was made possible}} by six library systems in northern Illincis. With the organizaticn of the library systems and development of interlibrary scan services and other cccperative activities, the problem of extending resource sharing among member libraries and between library systems arose. Several library systems have initiated <b>union</b> <b>catalogs</b> and a prinary consideration of this study has been the status and utility of those <b>union</b> <b>catalogs.</b> The study indicates that unicn catalogs for library systems will not be of much practical value in interlibrary loan services and that money and effort can be better expended in other directicns. The direction with the greatest potential is automated centralized processing and catalcging. The catalcging performed by the Library of Congress and available in its catalcg cards and Machine-Readable Catalcging (MARC) magnetic tapes is a means tc avoid unnecessary catalcging duplication and provides a convenient tool for automated processing.

Since other committees share an _interest in the subject, the Bibliography Committee asked the Board on Resources of America ~ Libraries and the Division of Cataloging and Classifi-cation to co-sponsor the programs and to help Mr. Esterquest and the Bibliography Committee plan the meetings, to be called an Institute on Regional Library Centers.
