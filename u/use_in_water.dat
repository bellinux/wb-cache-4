2500|$|Swim fins, {{also known}} as fins, or flippers, are blade-shaped {{extensions}} worn on feet or hands for <b>use</b> <b>in</b> <b>water.</b> They aid movement in aquatic sports such as swimming, surfing, and underwater diving. Swim fins are typically made of rubber or plastic. Benjamin Franklin invented wooden swim fins in 1717. His original design consisted of [...] and [...] palettes. Contrary to today's version of rubberized swim fins worn on the feet, Franklin's swim fins were originally intended for use on a person's hands. Shaped like lily pads or an artist's paint palette, they helped attain greater speed with each stroke. Franklin has since been posthumously honored by being inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame.|$|E
2500|$|Side {{products}} from this process include ferrophosphorus, a crude form of Fe2P, resulting from iron impurities in the mineral precursors. The silicate slag {{is a useful}} construction material. The fluoride is sometimes recovered for <b>use</b> <b>in</b> <b>water</b> fluoridation. More problematic is a [...] "mud" [...] containing significant amounts of white phosphorus. Production of white phosphorus is conducted in large facilities {{in part because it}} is energy intensive. The white phosphorus is transported in molten form. Some major accidents have occurred during transportation; train derailments at Brownston, Nebraska and Miamisburg, Ohio led to large fires. The worst incident in recent times was an environmental contamination in 1968 when the sea was polluted from spillage and/or inadequately treated sewage from a white phosphorus plant at Placentia Bay, Newfoundland.|$|E
2500|$|The Niagara Falls, New York, water {{treatment}} plant first used chlorine dioxide for drinking {{water treatment}} in 1944 for phenol destruction. Chlorine dioxide was introduced as a drinking water disinfectant {{on a large scale}} in 1956, when Brussels, Belgium, changed from chlorine to chlorine dioxide. Its most common <b>use</b> <b>in</b> <b>water</b> treatment is as a pre-oxidant prior to chlorination of drinking water to destroy natural water impurities that would otherwise produce trihalomethanes on exposure to free chlorine. Trihalomethanes are suspect carcinogenic disinfection by-products associated with chlorination of naturally occurring organics in the raw water. [...] Chlorine dioxide is also superior to chlorine when operating above pH 7, in the presence of ammonia and amines and/or for the control of biofilms in water distribution systems. Chlorine dioxide is used in many industrial water treatment applications as a biocide including cooling towers, process water, and food processing.|$|E
