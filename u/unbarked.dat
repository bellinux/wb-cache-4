60|$|One man slowly {{moving on}} towards Chalons {{was the only}} visible figure in the landscape. Cain might have looked as lonely and avoided. With an old {{sheepskin}} knapsack at his back, and a rough, <b>unbarked</b> stick cut out of some wood in his hand; miry, footsore, his shoes and gaiters trodden out, his hair and beard untrimmed; the cloak he carried over his shoulder, and the clothes he wore, sodden with wet; limping along in pain and difficulty; {{he looked as if}} the clouds were hurrying from him, as if the wail of the wind and the shuddering of the grass were directed against him, as if the low mysterious plashing of the water murmured at him, as if the fitful autumn night were disturbed by him.|$|E
40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{ecological study}} {{with a special}} emphasis on Non-timber forest products (NTFPs) was conducted between 2014 and 2015 on both anks of Lokame River in Lokame forest. The {{results showed that the}} Lokame natural forest has a very rich and diversified in NTFPs. Data collected over a total area of 2 ha identified 20 families and 25 different plant species producing NTFPs and 914 individuals, of which 39 % are food, 38 % for different uses, 14 % for aphrodisiacs and 9 % as medicinal. A comparison of data by region reveals that the left bank region is richer and more diversified than that of the right bank. Fruit is the most used organ (75 %) followed by bark (60 %) and leaves (50 %). The <b>unbarking</b> is the most important collection technique for the entire study area with a frequency of 70 %. The <b>unbarking</b> is followed by cutting down, collection, picking-up, thinning-out and uprooting. The collection by <b>unbarking,</b> uprooting and cutting down is destructive, henceforth these methods are not sustainable. The proportions of NTFPs collection are alarming for the conservation of Lokame forest area. It is therefore necessary to: (1) strengthen knowledge on NTFPs and sustainable management techniques associated with their exploitation, (2) develop and implement the NTFP-specific institutional and regulatory framework, (3) carry out economic diagnosis and control of the traceability of NTFP sectors, (4) strengthen institutional and human capacities {{for the development of the}} NTFP sector, and last (5) create a conducive environment in order to invest in the NTFP sector. Thus, Lokame natural forest will continue to play its role of biodiversity conservation and sustained production of natural resources...|$|R

60|$|The axes of the wood-cutters resounded {{among the}} gullies and ravines of Ungava, and awakened the {{numerous}} {{echoes of the}} mountains. The encampment no longer presented a green spot, watered by a tiny rill, but was strewn with logs in all stages of formation, and chips innumerable. The frameworks of the dwelling-houses began {{to rise from the}} earth, presenting, in their unfinished condition, a bristling, uncomfortable appearance, suggesting thoughts in the beholder's mind highly disparaging to art, and deeply sympathetic with outraged nature. The tents still stood, and the campfire burned, but the superior proportions of the rising fort threw these entirely into the shade. A rude wharf of <b>unbarked</b> logs ran from the beach into the river. It had been begun and finished in a couple of days, for the convenience of Gaspard while visiting his nets, as he sometimes did before the water left them. Everything, in short, bore evidence of the most bustling activity and persevering energy; and in a few weeks from the time of their first landing, the dwelling-houses were sufficiently weather-tight to be habitable, and the other portions of the establishment in an advanced condition.|$|E
60|$|They led us--three of {{them and}} all fresh and pretty--into a room {{furnished}} with a golden-brown bearskin. The tokonoma, recess aforementioned, held one scroll-picture of bats wheeling in the twilight, a bamboo flower-holder, and yellow flowers. The ceiling was of panelled wood, {{with the exception of}} one strip at the side nearest the window, and this was made of plaited shavings of cedar-wood, marked off from the rest of the ceiling by a wine-brown bamboo so polished that it might have been lacquered. A touch of the hand sent one side of the room flying back, and we entered a really large room with another tokonoma framed on one side by eight or ten feet of an unknown wood, bearing the same grain as a Penang lawyer, and above by a stick of <b>unbarked</b> tree set there purely because it was curiously mottled. In this second tokonoma was a pearl-grey vase, and that was all. Two sides of the room were of oiled paper, and the joints of the beams were covered by the brazen images of crabs, half life-size. Save for the sill of the tokonoma, which was black lacquer, every inch of wood in the place was natural grain without flaw. Outside was the garden, fringed with a hedge of dwarf-pines and adorned with a tiny pond, water-smoothed stones sunk in the soil, and a blossoming cherry tree.|$|E
60|$|In {{the morning}} {{the other side of}} the picture was {{revealed}} in the colours of the sunlight. There was never a cloud in the sky that rested on the snow-line of the horizon as a sapphire on white velvet. Hills of pure white, or speckled and furred with woods, rose up above the solid white levels of the fields, and the sun rioted over their embroideries till the eyes ached. Here and there on the exposed slopes the day's warmth--the thermometer was nearly forty degrees--and the night's cold had made a bald and shining crust upon the snow; but the most part was soft powdered stuff, ready to catch the light on a thousand crystals and multiply it sevenfold. Through this magnificence, and thinking nothing of it, a wood-sledge drawn by two shaggy red steers, the <b>unbarked</b> logs diamond-dusted with snow, shouldered down the road in a cloud of frosty breath. It is the mark of inexperience in this section of the country to confound a sleigh which you use for riding with the sledge that is devoted to heavy work; and it is, I believe, a still greater sign of worthlessness to think that oxen are driven, as they are in most places, by scientific twisting of the tail. The driver with red mittens on his hands, felt overstockings that come up to his knees, and, perhaps, a silvery-gray coon-skin coat on his back, walks beside, crying, 'Gee, haw!' even as is written in American stories. And the speech of the driver explains many things in regard to the dialect story, which at its best is an infliction to many. Now that I have heard the long, unhurried drawl of Vermont, my wonder is, not that the New England tales should be printed in what, for the sake of argument, we will call English and its type, but rather that they should not have appeared in Swedish or Russian. Our alphabet is too limited. This part of the country belongs by laws unknown to the United States, but which obtain all the world over, to the New England story and the ladies who write it. You feel this in the air as soon as you see the white-painted wooden houses left out in the snow, the austere schoolhouse, and the people--the men of the farms, the women who work as hard as they with, it may be, less enjoyment of life--the other houses, well painted and quaintly roofed, that belong to Judge This, Lawyer That, and Banker Such an one; all powers in the metropolis of six thousand folk over by the railway station. More acutely still, do you realise the atmosphere when you read in the local paper announcements of 'chicken suppers' and 'church sociables' to be given by such and such a denomination, sandwiched between paragraphs of genial and friendly interest, showing that the countryside live (and without slaying each other) on terms of terrifying intimacy.|$|E
60|$|Let us {{return to}} the new towns. Three times within one year did fortune come {{knocking}} {{to the door of}} a man I know. Once at Seattle, when that town was a gray blur after a fire; once at Tacoma, in the days when the steam-tram ran off the rails twice a week; and once at Spokane Falls. But in the roar of the land-boom he did not hear her, and she went away leaving him only a tenderness akin to weakness for all new towns, and a desire, mercifully limited by lack of money, to gamble in every one of them. Of all the excitements that life offers there are few to be compared with the whirl of a red-hot boom; also it is strictly moral, because you do fairly earn your 'unearned increment' by labour and perspiration and sitting up far into the night--by working like a fiend, as all pioneers must do. And consider all that is in it! The headlong stampede to the new place; the money dashed down like counters for merest daily bread; the arrival of the piled cars whence the raw material of a city--men, lumber, and shingle--are shot on to the not yet nailed platform; the slashing out and pegging down of roads across the blank face of the wilderness; the heaving up amid shouts and yells of the city's one electric light--a raw sizzling arc atop of an <b>unbarked</b> pine pole; the sweating, jostling mob at the sale of town-lots; the roar of 'Let the woman have it!' that stops all bidding when the one other woman in the place puts her price on a plot; the packed real-estate offices; the real-estate agents themselves, lost novelists of prodigious imagination; the gorgeous pink and blue map of the town, hung up in the bar-room, with every railroad from Portland to Portland meeting in its heart; the misspelled curse against 'this dam hole in the ground' scrawled on the flank of a strayed freight-car by some man who had lost his money and gone away; the conferences at street corners of syndicates six hours established by men not twenty-five years old; the outspoken contempt for the next town, also 'on the boom,' and, therefore, utterly vile; the unceasing tramp of heavy feet on the board pavement, where stranger sometimes turns on stranger in an agony of conviction, and, shaking him by the shoulder, shouts in his ear, 'By G--d! Isn't it grand? Isn't it glorious? 'and last, the sleep of utterly worn-out men, three in each room of the shanty hotel: 'All meals two dollars. All drinks thirty-five cents. No washing done here. The manager not responsible for anything.' Does the bald catalogue of these recitals leave you cold? It is possible; but it is also possible after three days in a new town to set the full half of a truck-load of archbishops fighting for corner lots as they never fought for mitre or crozier. There is a contagion in a boom as irresistible as that of a panic in a theatre.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} varying length of {{pulpwood}} {{is discussed in}} relation to place of conversion, loading, length of lorry, stacking space at roadside, method of skidding, and the preparation of loads after crosscutting at stump. The conclusion is reached that for Scottish upland conditions pulpwood should be prepared in 10 - to 12 -feet lengths in two stages, the feller preparing loads for skidding and the horse or tractor roughly piling the <b>unbarked</b> pulpwood at roadside for mecha-nical loading on to long-distance transport. For the Fort William mill a standard length of io feet, with tolerance down to 8 feet, will be adopted. Mechanization is not envisaged for some years beyond chain saw, tractor-mounted double-drum winch, and lorry- or tractor-mounted crane with hydraulic grab, while the horse will play its part in skidding {{for at least the}} next five years.

40|$|This licentiate {{thesis is}} a monography complemented with one {{published}} article: “Interactive Design – {{the desire for}} autonomous upright mobility: A longitudinal case study, Technology and Disability 19 (2007) 213 - 224 ”. My {{hope is that the}} combination of the monographic part (with its phenomenological tone, personified and situated), and the more <b>unbarked</b> “Technology and Disability” article (with its orientation towards the general rather than the personal aspects) will contribute to dialogues on different scientifical approaches. The overall purpose of this thesis is to develop new knowledge on child development under the conditions of SMA II. As I use a life-world phenomenological approach my first quest is to highlight and make explicit what appeared in Hanna’s life-world and how these experiences have contributed to her overall development. I also want to put forward how Hanna’s motility and mobility were supported, guided by what she expressed and strived for, in order to promote a healthy physical, psychological and social development. A special focus is on independent locomotion and how this was accomplished for Hanna. By using technology in a new way it was possible to enhance Hanna’s access to the world through the medium of her lived body, thus changing her life-world by widening her life-world horizon.

40|$|We {{studied the}} initial process of reading, {{with a focus}} on typography, whether it is {{possible}} to increase childrens lust to read in the age six to seven years old, by adjusting the typography and graphic design.   We conduct this study through qualitative and quantitative studies, mainly interviews with a main focus on children in this particular age were used. In addition to the interviews a questioniare were sent out to a selection of students. The study also contained an interview with a pedagogue as well as studies of the current and existing textbooks and teaching aids that is used on the school we are looking into. During the study we consulted educated pedagogues to get an understanding of the children and their learning {{and to be able to}} approach them in a suitable way. The theories we have been using were mainly from a typographic point of view. Other areas we explored were theories about reading processes. This study showed that every child needs a method that is suitable for them and that the material provided today is typographically inconsistent. The childrens and teachers needs and wishes in typography did not correspond with the current teaching aids design.   From this study the followning points were made about how to design a textbook for children in the first grade: • The typeface should be a sans serif. • The point size should be bigger than 12 points. • Text should be aligned to the left. • Sentences should be short without becoming abstract. • To maintain focus on the text the layout should be simple and <b>unbarked.</b> • The format should be designed after the pourpose of the publication, for example when it is a complement to the textbook, the format should be of such character that it is easy for the children to bring home. • There should be a typographical consistency through all of the materials provided to the children...|$|E
30|$|The {{pretreatment}} liquids (PLs) used in {{this study}} were produced from corn cobs (PL 1), sugarcane bagasse (PL 2), raw cassava stems (Manihot esculenta) (PL 3), chipped wood of Norway spruce (Picea abies) (PL 4), European white birch (Betula pubescens) (PL 5), and hybrid aspen (Populus tremula × P. tremuloides) (PL 6). The pretreatment of corn cobs, bagasse, spruce and birch was performed by SEKAB E-Technology using a 30 -l pretreatment reactor in the Biorefinery Demo Plant in Örnsköldsvik, Sweden. Corn cobs were treated in a continuous mode with addition of 0.54  % (w/w) of H 2 SO 4, at a temperature of 186  °C (corresponding to 11  bar over-pressure) and with a residence time of 6.4  min. The bagasse was pretreated at a temperature of 188  °C (14  bar over-pressure), after being impregnated with SO 2 (0.3  kg SO 2 /h), corresponding to around 0.6  % SO 2 /kg of sugarcane bagasse (DW, dry weight). The residence time in the reactor was 10  min, and the resulting pH was 2.1. <b>Unbarked</b> spruce wood chips were treated a temperature of 204  °C, (18  bar over-pressure) with an addition of 1.2 – 1.3  kg SO 2 /h, corresponding to 1  % SO 2 /kg of spruce wood chips (DW). The residence time in the reactor was 7 – 8  min, and the resulting pH was 1.4 – 1.5. Birch wood was pretreated at 190  °C (16  bar over-pressure) with a SO 2 addition of 0.7  kg/h, corresponding to approximately 0.5  % SO 2 /kg birch wood chips (DW). The residence time was 7  min and the resulting pH was 1.8. Milled aspen and raw cassava stem samples were pretreated in laboratory scale reactors, aspen in a microwave reactor (Biotage Initiator 2.0, Biotage, Uppsala, Sweden) and cassava stems in a stainless steel reactor equipped with an internal thermocouple and a PID module for controlling the temperature. The aspen pretreatment in the microwave system was performed at 165  °C for 10  min with an addition of H 2 SO 4 that resulted in a final concentration of 1  % (w/w) of the total weight of the reaction mixture. Raw cassava stems were pretreated at 170  °C for 20  min in a 1  % (w/w) aqueous solution of H 2 SO 4 that was added to the biomass at a liquid-to-solids ratio of 9 : 1. After pretreatments, all of the resulting pretreated materials were cooled and stored at 4  °C until further use.|$|E
