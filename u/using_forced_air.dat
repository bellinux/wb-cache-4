Air temperature at different process stages affected both process times and system thermal demands. Operating conditions for each stage, which provided the best system global performance, were chosen, aiming energy consumption reduction without damaging product final quality, once each stage minimum requirements were taken into account.

40|$|A new chiller-less {{data center}} liquid cooling system {{utilizing}} the outside air environment {{has been shown}} to achieve up to 90 % reduction in cooling energy compared to traditional chiller based data center cooling systems. The system removes heat from Volume servers inside a Sealed Rack and transports the heat using a liquid loop to an Outdoor Heat Exchanger which rejects the heat to the outdoor ambient environment.

40|$|Feasibility {{study of}} a passive {{aeration}} reactor equipped with vertical pipes for compost stabilization of cow manure Pilot-scale composting was carried out with cow manure to evaluate the performances of two passive aeration systems: a conventional passive aeration system equipped with horizon-tal pipes and an unusual passive aeration method based on air delivery by means of vertical pipes. The effects of both types of passive aeration apparatus were investigated {{in order to determine}} the degree of composting rate by continuously monitoring temperature, moisture content, organic matter, electrical conductivity, pH and C/N ratio in the piles. Tem-peratures in the range of thermophily (55 – 65 °C) were reached in all runs within 1 – 2 days then lasting for about 1 week, a span long enough for pathogen abatement. Results suggest that passive aeration carried out by vertical pipes is more effective for air delivery into compost piles than con-ventional passive aeration of air adduction with horizontal pipes. The variation in the number of vertical pipes was revealed to be an important parameter for the control of com-posting rate and temperature. Composting rates estimated from the heat balance equation were substantially in agree-ment with those computed through the conversion ratio of total organic matter decrement. The conversion ratios and composting rates obtained in this study using passive aeration with vertical pipes were well aligned with those found <b>using</b> <b>forced</b> <b>air</b> delivery systems...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIncreased {{interest}} in microwave puffing {{is due to}} its ability to obtain low-fat healthy foods and ready-to-eat products that emulate deep fried foods. Determination of optimal conditions for this complicated process has been difficult and as a result, although several patents exist {{on the concept of}} microwave puffing, we are yet to see any large scale commercial use of it. A fundamental physics based computational modeling approach integrated with relevant experimentation, as used in this work, is an ideal framework to understand and optimize microwave puffing. Coupled porous media transport and large deformation model, describing complex physical phenomena occurring during the process such as electromagnetic heating, heat and moisture transport, evaporation and structural changes, was formulated and solved. Temperature (using infrared camera and fiber optic probes), moisture and volume measurements were performed in potato samples to validate the model. The effect of various processing and operating conditions on the puffed potato quality was studied. It was found that infrared addition to microwave puffing leads to a better quality product. Hot air can be used with microwaves to reduce the final moisture content; although the change is not as significant compared to addition of infrared. Heating of sample <b>using</b> <b>forced</b> <b>air</b> convection may lead to decreased volume products. An initial moisture content near 1. 4 db may be optimum for puffing. Relative humidity of the surroundings had no effect on the puffing characteristics.

40|$|The {{construction}} and operating {{characteristics of a}} microwave (MW) electrodeless UV lamp are described. Instead of using a MW oven or a MW cavity to excite a plasma discharge in a glass bulb, in this work the optical radiation emitted by the gaseous plasma discharge is produced by the near field of a coaxial cable dipole antenna placed inside the recess of the quartz bulb. Experimental results are reported, which were obtained by applying MW power up to 700 W in continuous wave regime to an Ar-Hg filled cylindrical bulb, and 160 W to a XeBr 2 filled spherical bulb at 2. 45 GHz. The UV emission from a 6 W Ar-Hg lamp is compared with a commercial lamp, demonstrating {{the advantages of the}} new method in terms of efficiency.

The article focuses on the advantages of the non-cavity activation method of the UV lamp, taking into account industrial applications. In fact, the coaxial antenna excitation method is characterized by extreme simplicity, due to the absence of resonant metal enclosures.

Titanium (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V) alloy is an alpha, beta alloy which is solution treated at a temperature of 950 ºC to attain beta phase. This beta phase is maintained by quenching and subsequent aging to increase strength. Thermal cycling process was carried out for Ti- 6 Al- 4 V specimens <b>using</b> <b>forced</b> <b>air</b> cooling. Heat treated titanium alloy specimen was used to carry out various tests before and after thermal cycling, The test, like tensile properties, co-efficient of thermal expansion, Microstructure, Compression test, Vickers Hardness was examined by the following test.

The FSIS has proposed that by following these guidelines, allowable growth of Clostridium perfringens {{is limited to}} a 1 -log 10 multiplication during cooling after cooking of ready-to-eat meat products. Numerous small meat processors have difficulties complying with these performance standards. Several attempts, mainly focused on microbiological aspects, have been made to develop predictive models for growth of C. perfringens within the range of cooling temperatures of the guidelines. Conversely, studies dealing with heat transfer models to predict cooling rates in meat products, do not address microbial growth. Integration of heat transfer relationships with C. perfringens growth relationships during cooling of meat products has been very limited. ^ The objective of the current study was to integrate a heat transfer model and a C. perfringens growth model into a user-friendly computer program for accurate prediction of cooling rates and potential growth of the microorganism during cooling of cooked boneless ham. ^ The heat transfer component was developed in Matlabo® 6. 5 using finite element analysis to model two-dimensional axisymmetric transient heat conduction.

The cell was operated by self-aspiration or forced air. The air flow rate was measured using a McMillan meter (self-aspiration) and a mass flow meter (forced air). The bubble size was measured by a photographic technique developed at McGill. From repeat experiments, the average relative standard deviation on Jg was ca. 2 % and on db was ca. 13 %. No effect of location on bubble size was found. In self-aspiration mode Jg increased with impeller speed due to increased suction and decreased with increasing frother concentration and solids content. The effect of frother was attributed to increased recirculation of air as the bubble size was reduced. The effect of solids appears related to sedimentation. Bubble size increased with increasing impeller speed, which was attributed to the increase in Jg. Solids did not affect the bubble size. Bubble size decreased with frother most notably at low concentration then remained almost constant at high frother concentration. The critical coalescence concentration appeared to be close to 5 ppm for the present conditions. The bubble surface area flux Sb increased approximately linearly with impeller speed up to ca. 40 s- 1. <b>Using</b> <b>forced</b> <b>air</b> the bubble size behaved as expected: it decreased with increasing impeller speed (due to higher shear) and decreasing Jg.

However, {{very little is}} known about the influence of sanitation on responses of stored-product insects to structural heat treatments. The impact of sanitation on responses of life stages of the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, an economically important pest in flour mills, were investigated during three 24 h structural heat treatments of the Kansas State University pilot flour mill. Two sanitation levels, dusting of wheat flour (~ 0. 5 g) and 2 -cm deep flour (~ 43 g), were created in 25 plastic bioassay boxes each holding 50 eggs, 50 young larvae, 50 old larvae, 50 pupae, and 50 adults of T. castaneum in separate compartments. Five boxes were placed on each of five floors of the pilot mill during 13 - 14 May 2009, 25 - 26 August 2009, and 7 - 8 May 2010 heat treatments <b>using</b> <b>forced</b> <b>air</b> gas heaters. During the August 2009 and May 2010 heat treatments, 100 eggs or 100 adults of T. castaneum were exposed inside each 20 cm diameter by 15 cm high PVC ring placed only on first and third floors and holding 0. 1 (15 g), 0. 2 (38 g), 1 (109 g), 3 (388 g), 6 (937 g), or 10 (1645 g) cm deep wheat flour. Among the mill floors, first floor had lower maximum temperature. The first floor rests on a thick concrete foundation, did not get heated from both sides unlike other floors, and had poor air movement resulting in cold pockets (temperatures < 50 oC). Mortality of life stages was lower on first floor than other floors and adults were less susceptible than other life stages especially on first floor. In general, both these tests have shown that the mortality of T. castaneum life stages were influenced by how quickly temperatures reached 50 oC, how long temperatures were held above 50 oC, and the maximum temperature. Protective effects of sanitation were evident only if temperatures did not reach 50 oC. However, removal of flour accumulations is essential to improve heat treatment effectiveness against all T. castaneum life stages during a 24 h treatment...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Washington State UniversityThe {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to develop radio frequency (RF) treatments for pest control in dried fruits. The dielectric properties of five dried fruits were determined at RF and microwave (MW) frequencies and temperatures to determine if differential heating might be possible. Results showed that RF treatment is feasible for insect disinfection due to the higher penetration depth (22. 9 - 103. 7 cm) in dried fruits at 27 and 40 MHz when compared to that (1. 3 - 4 cm) at MW 915 and 1800 MHz. A computer model that solves Maxwell's electromagnetic and Fourier's heat transfer equations was developed using finite element-based commercial software, COMSOL, to investigate temperature distributions in three horizontal layers: the top, middle, and bottom layers, of raisins packed in rectangular containers (25. 5 x 15. 0 x 10. 0 m 3) during RF heating. Simulated and experimental results showed overheating at the edges and corners of the samples. Temperatures in the middle layer were higher compared to the top and bottom layers. The simulation model was further used to investigate the effect of sample shape, electrode configuration, and a combination treatment of RF with forced air at 60 ºC on the heating uniformity of raisins. An RF treatment protocol to control insect in raisins was developed based upon the appropriate electrode configuration and treatment condition with forced air at 60 ºC. The heating uniformity was improved throughout the bulk samples in containers with shapes that have less sharp edges and corners. The process time required to disinfest the raisins (3 kg bulk packaged) was reduced from 361 min <b>using</b> <b>forced</b> <b>air</b> at 60 ºC to 21. 5 min using RF-forced air at 60 ºC. The quality of the RF-forced air treated samples showed slight differences when compared to the control, while significant changes in moisture and color occurred for raisins treated with forced air (60 ºC) alone. This research provides {{a better understanding of the}} behavior of lower moisture fruits during RF heating and new information on how product and electrode configurations affect heating uniformity.
