5|$|A {{predominantly}} saprophytic species, Morchella rufobrunnea fruit bodies grow singly or {{in clusters}} in disturbed soil or woodchips used in landscaping. Large numbers can appear {{the year after}} wood mulch has been spread on the ground. Typical disturbed habitats include fire pits, near compost piles, logging roads, and dirt basements. Fruiting usually occurs in the spring, although fruit bodies {{can be found in}} these habitats most of the year. Other preferred habitats include steep slopes and plateaus, and old-growth conifer forests. In Cyprus, the fungus is frequently reported from coastal, <b>urban</b> <b>and</b> <b>suburban</b> areas under olive trees (Olea europaea).|$|E

40|$|AN ABSTRACT OF THE THESIS OF CHARLES ALAN PAYNE II, for the Masters of Arts {{degree in}} Criminology and Criminal Justice, {{presented}} on April 29, 2016, at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. TITLE: DOES SOCIAL LEARNING THEORY PREDICT DELINQUNECY DIFFERENTLY ACROSS <b>URBAN,</b> RURAL, <b>AND</b> <b>SUBURBAN</b> AREAS? MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. GEORGE BURRUSS The {{purpose of this}} study is to examine whether social learning theory predicts delinquency differently across <b>urban,</b> rural, <b>and</b> <b>suburban</b> areas. The lack of research in this area is problematic because while there are known differences between <b>urban,</b> rural, <b>and</b> <b>suburban</b> offending patterns, there is a lack of evidence to suggest why these patterns occur. The results of the study show that differential association, definitions, and differential reinforcement were significant across all three geographic locations. However, when analyzed by geographic location, differential reinforcement was only significant in suburban areas. In fact, differential reinforcement was the strongest predictor of delinquency in suburban areas, when differential association was the strongest in <b>urban</b> <b>and</b> rural...|$|R
