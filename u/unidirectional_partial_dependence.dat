We consider models which are split into k subgroups and consider various classes of dependence information either within the subgroups or between the subgroups.

Our paper adds to various recent approaches to obtain reliable and usable risk bounds resp. estimates of the model risk by including <b>partial</b> <b>dependence</b> information additional to {{the information on the}} marginals.

40|$|This article {{presents}} Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots, {{a tool for}} vi-sualizing the model estimated by any supervised learning algorithm. Classical <b>partial</b> <b>dependence</b> plots (PDPs) help visualize the average partial relationship between the predicted response and one or more features. In the presence of substantial interac-tion effects, the partial response relationship can be heterogeneous. Thus, an average curve, such as the PDP, can obfuscate {{the complexity of the}} modeled relationship. Accordingly, ICE plots refine the <b>partial</b> <b>dependence</b> plot by graphing the functional relationship between the predicted response and the feature for individual observations. Specifically, ICE plots highlight the variation in the fitted values across the range of a covariate, suggesting where and to what extent heterogeneities might exist. In ad-dition to providing a plotting suite for exploratory analysis, we include a visual test for additive structure in the data generating model. Through simulated examples and real data sets, we demonstrate how ICE plots can shed light on estimated models in ways PDPs cannot. Procedures outlined are available in the R package ICEbox. ...|$|R

Proteins translated from endogenous poliovirus RNA in preincubated extracts from virus-infected HeLa cells are poorly cleaved.

The main strengths of the employed machine learning algorithms are their very high predictive power and their ability to deal with heterogeneous data sources and potentially collinear factors. This opens the door for future incorporation of new variables as features for which, a priori, there is no substantive theory underlying their association with crime, but might be found to have a strong predictive power. The model interpretation techniques available for tree-based ensemble models (feature importance rankings, <b>partial</b> <b>dependence</b> plots) make the models more transparent and offer insights in terms of the predictive power of each feature. On the weaknesses side, as for any supervised learning technique, the presented models can be used for prediction, but not for inferring a causal effect between the features and the dependent variable.|$|R

The coding schemes that achieve this region are based on rate-splitting and superposition coding. In this paper, we develop a multicoding scheme {{to achieve the same}} rate region. A key advantage of the multicoding nature of the proposed coding scheme is that it can be naturally extended to more general settings, such as when encoders have state information or can overhear each other. In particular, we extend our coding scheme to characterize the capacity region of the state-dependent deterministic Z-interference channel when noncausal state information is available at the interfering transmitter. We specialize our results to the case of the linear deterministic model with on/off interference which models a wireless system where a cognitive transmitter is noncausally aware of the times it interferes with a primary transmission. For this special case, we provide an explicit expression for the capacity region and discuss some interesting properties of the optimal strategy.

40|$|This work {{introduces}} {{methods and}} associated software for enhancing the interpretability of fitted models, {{with emphasis on}} classification and regression trees. We begin in Chapter 1 by describing novel techniques for growing classification and regression trees designed to induce visually interpretable trees. This is achieved by penalizing splits that extend the subset of features used in a particular branch of the tree. After a brief motivation, we summarize existing methods and introduce new ones, providing illustrative examples throughout. Using a number of real classification and regression datasets, we find that these procedures can offer more interpretable fits than the CART methodology with very modest increases in out-of-sample loss. ^ These techniques are implemented in the R package itree, described in Chapter 2. In addition to the procedures introduced in Chapter 1, itree implements a method for visualizing the out-of-sample risk {{as well as the}} usual classification and regression tree methodologies. Chapter 2 presents illustrative examples and demonstrates itree 2 ̆ 7 s usage for aspects of the software that are novel or unique to itree. ^ Whereas Chapters 1 and 2 relate to tree-based methods, Chapter 3 describes Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots, a methodology for visualizing the model estimated by any supervised learning algorithm.

40|$|Abstract. The naive Bayesian {{classifier}} is {{a simple}} and effective classification method, which assumes a Bayesian network in which each attribute has the class label as its only one parent. But this assumption is not obviously hold in many real world domains. Tree-Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN) is a state-of-the-art extension of the naive Bayes, which can express <b>partial</b> <b>dependence</b> relations among attributes. In this paper, we analyze the implementations of two different TAN classifiers and their tree structures. Experiments show how different dependence relations impact on accuracy of TAN classifiers. We present a kind of semi-lazy TAN classifier, which builds a TAN {{identical to the original}} TAN at training time, but adjusts the dependence relations for a new test instance at classification time. Our extensive experimental results show that this kind of semi-lazy classifier delivers lower error than the original TAN and is more efficient than Superparent TAN. ...|$|R
