40|$|Abstractâ€”This work {{introduces}} a hand exoskeleton that allows {{full range of}} motion and can exert bi-directional forces on the finger phalanges. The link lengths {{and structure of the}} proposed mechanism have been emerged as a result of kinematics-based optimization criteria. It is an under-actuated mechanism allowing 4 DOF/finger with one active degree. The selection of the actuator has been based on human hand capabilities to accomplish common daily life activities. An initial <b>un-actuated</b> finger prototype has been developed to analyze the mechanism functionality and to confirm the optimization results. Results have demonstrated that the device covers the complete operational range of motion of a human hand.

40|$|Acoustic {{perturbations}} {{emitted from}} a two dimensional compressible cavity flow are analysed and controlled using direct numerical simulations (DNS) and an output feedback law which expresses the actuation (a synthetic jet) velocity {{as a function}} of wall pressure fluctuation sensors. To get the feedback control law, a non-linear reduced-order model (ROM) is first built from <b>un-actuated</b> flow fields and flow forced with a large frequency bandwidth actuation. The control law is then determined by a Linear Quadratic Regulator algorithm. The control law implemented in the DNS provides a significant and global noise reduction (up to 10 dB). The actuation law remains efficient for long times, greater than the temporal window of observation used to design the ROM. Actuation of moderate amplitudes generate some non-linear effects but perturbations continue to be damped. ...|$|E
40|$|As haptic {{interactions}} begin leaving research {{areas for}} commercial applications, accurate user interactions with virtual objects take new precedence. A common, low-cost haptic interface device is the PHANTOM Omni. This device has {{six degrees of}} freedom for positioning, allowing the user to position and orientate the device anywhere in its workspace. One downside to the PHANTOM is that it only has motors for controlling the position of the device, meaning the orientation of the device does not affect the interactions felt by the user through the haptic code. However, it is possible to incorporate these <b>un-actuated</b> joints to affect the force the user experiences, giving a feeling similar to bending a rod. Two methods are explored: a simple spatial analysis technique using Bezier curves and a more general virtual manipulator synchronization method using a null-space filter to determine device movement...|$|E
40|$|Results of a {{wind tunnel}} test {{campaign}} to assess technologies for improvement of helicopter fuselage and rotor system drag are described in this paper. The work done {{was part of the}} EU funded Clean Sky CARD project (Contribution to Analysis of Rotor-hub Drag reduction). Wind tunnel tests of an accurate 1 / 4 scale, Airbus Helicopters H 155 were performed in a variety of advance ratios, pitch angles and side-slip angles to simulate cruise and approach conditions. 1 / 3 rd of the rotor diameter was represented in the model, and the rotor was otherwise rigid and <b>un-actuated</b> (fixed blade pitch around the azimuth). Rotor system forces and moments were measured independently of the fuselage forces and moments, thus allowing the various contributions to the total drag to be evaluated. The paper describes elements of the model design and data analysis for drag and power evaluation, and presents sample results...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a portable, assistive, soft robotic glove designed to augment hand rehabilitation {{for individuals with}} functional grasp pathologies. The robotic glove utilizes soft actuators consisting of molded elastomeric chambers with fiber reinforcements that induce specific bending, twisting and extending trajectories under fluid pressurization. These soft actuators were mechanically programmed to match and support the range of motion of individual fingers. They demonstrated the ability to generate significant force when pressurized and exhibited low impedance when <b>un-actuated.</b> To operate the soft robotic glove, a control hardware system was designed and included fluidic pressure sensors {{in line with the}} hydraulic actuators and a closed-loop controller to regulate the pressure. Demonstrations with the complete system were performed to evaluate the ability of the soft robotic glove to carry out gross and precise functional grasping. Compared to existing devices, the soft robotic glove has the potential to increase user freedom and independence through its portable waist belt pack and open palm design...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn {{investigation}} on {{the viability of}} pulsed jets as active vortex generator devices was conducted. The devices were installed and tested on an adverse pressure gradient turbulent boundary layer designed to simulate the suction side of a conventional aircraft wing. Both co-rotating and counter-rotating jet geometries were used. The duty cycle and frequency of pulsation were varied and their effects were investigated by measuring the skin friction gains at a predefined location (the location of the minimum skin friction for the <b>un-actuated</b> situation) on the adverse pressure gradient turbulent boundary layer. Pulsing the jets proved {{to be successful in}} increasing the wall skin friction and therefore potentially delaying separation. The improvements in wall shear stress were approximately proportional to the duty cycle. The frequency of jet pulsation was found to be important for attaining optimal gains, however no clear relationship between frequency and shear stress gain was observed. Phase averaged wall shear stress measurements far downstream of actuation indicate that quasi-steady structures are introduced by the vortex generators when actuating with a sufficiently high pulse frequency. In this situation interactions between successive structures produced by the jets were likely to be occurring...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFlow {{around a}} cavity is {{characterized}} by a self-sustained mechanism in which the shear layer impinges on the downstream edge of the cavity resulting in a feedback mechanism. Direct numerical simulations of the flow at low Reynolds number has been carried out to get pressure and velocity fluctuations, for the case of <b>un-actuated</b> and multi frequency actuation. A reduced order model for the isentropic compressible equations based on themethod of proper orthogonal decomposition has been constructed. The model has been extended to include the effect of control. The reduced order dynamical system shows a divergence in time integration. A method of calibration based on theminimization of a linear functional of error, to the sensitivity of the modes, is proposed. The calibrated low order model is used to design a feedback control of cavity flows based on an observer design. For the experimental implementation of the controller, a state estimate based on the observed pressure measurements is obtained through a linear stochastic estimation. Finally the obtained control is introduced into the Direct Numerical Simulation to obtain a decrease in spectra of the cavity acoustic mode...|$|E
40|$|As haptic devices {{become more}} common, the afford-ability, complexity, {{and size of}} the device are all factors in {{considering}} appropriate applications. A popular haptic device is the PHANTOM Omni, a six degree of freedom (6 DOF) positioning manipulator with 3 DOF force feedback. To increase the usability of the class of under actuated devices that include the common PHANTOM Omni, an impedance requiring full 6 DOF force feedback control law for under actuated devices based on a virtual mechanism (VM) was developed. The goal of this control law is to mask the <b>un-actuated</b> joints of a physical robot manipulator (RM) using force feedback on the actuated joints. The control theory includes using a VM as a constraint for the RM. Weighted matrices and the pseudo inverse Jacobian control law place the VM as to minimize the error between the current RM position and somewhere on the path of the VM. A pseudo inverse Jacobian control law is used to generate a force to send to user of the RM. The theory is tested using the PHANTOM Omni with six cases where the importance of the position error and orientation error for the manipulator are varied...|$|E

40|$|Based {{on screw}} {{theory and the}} {{principle}} of one- leg driving by an independent motor, a methodology for the structural synthesis of fully-decoupled three-rotational and one-translational (3 R 1 T) parallel mechanisms is proposed by analysing {{the characteristics of the}} input-output relationships for fully-decoupled parallel mechanisms. Firstly, the desired forms for both the direct and the inverse Jacobian matrices of fully-decoupled parallel mechanisms are constructed by virtue of screw theory; this is in order to satisfy the demand that these two Jacobian matrices should be non-zero diagonal matrices. Secondly, the effective screw, the actuated screw and the mobile <b>un-actuated</b> screws of each limb are established via reciprocal screw theory, while all the possible topology structures fulfilling the requirements are obtained, based on different connectivities for each limb. Finally, the desired fully-decoupled parallel mechanisms can be synthesized using the structural synthesis rule, while the structural synthesis of fully-decoupled 3 R 1 T parallel mechanisms can be obtained by exploiting the above-mentioned methodology. Moreover, the Jacobian matrix of a synthesized 3 R 1 T parallel mechanism is deduced to demonstrate the decoupling feature of the parallel mechanism, which also validates the correctness of the methodology for the type synthesis of fully-decoupled 3 R 1 T parallel mechanisms. The contents of this paper provide a reference and possess significant theoretical meanings for the synthesis and development of the 3 R 1 T fully-decoupled parallel mechanisms. Motors are mounted one per leg, with each one of them actuating a one Degree-of-freedom (DoF) of the fully-decoupled parallel mechanism through a one-to-one velocity relationship...|$|E
