We develop a practical simplification algorithm that enables “Unhiding ” various redundancies in a unified framework. Based on time stamping literals in the binary implication graph, the algorithm applies various binary clause based simplifications, including techniques that, when run repeatedly until fixpoint, can be too costly. <b>Unhiding</b> can also be applied during search, taking learnt clauses into account.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} the Indented Pixel Tree Browser—an interactive tool for exploring, annotating, and comparing huge hierarchical structures on {{different levels of}} granularity. We exploit the indented visual metaphor to map tree structures to one-dimensional zigzag curves to primarily achieve an overview representation for the entire hierarchy. We focus on space-efficiency and simultaneous uncovering of tree-specific phenomena. Each displayed plot can be filtered for substructures that are mapped to a larger space and hence, <b>unhide</b> more finegranular substructures that are hidden in the compressed overview. By representing tree structures side-by-side, the viewer can easily compare them visually and detect similar patterns and also anomalies. In our approach, we follow the information seeking mantra: overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand. More interactive features such as expanding and collapsing of nodes, applying different color codings, or distorting the tree horizontally as well as vertically support a viewer when exploring huge hierarchical data sets. The usefulness of our interactive browsing tool is demonstrated in a case study for the NCBI taxonomy that contains 324, 276 species and organisms that are hierarchically organized. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{construct}} explicit Lagrangian formulation for the massive spin- 2 supermultiplets with N = k supersymmetries k = 1, 2, 3, 4. Such multiplets contain 2 k particles with spin- 3 / 2, so there must exist N = 2 k local supersymmetries {{in the full}} nonlinear theories spontaneously broken so that only N = k global supersymmetries remain unbroken. In this paper we <b>unhide</b> these hidden supersymmetries by using gauge invariant formulation for massive high spin particles. Such formulation, operating with the right set of physical degrees of freedom {{from the very beginning}} and having non- singular massless limit, turns out to be very well suited for construction of massive supermultiplets from the well known massless ones. For all four cases considered we have managed to show that the massless limit of the supertransformations for N = k massive supermultiplet could be uplifted to N = 2 k supersymmetry. This, in turn, allows one to investigate which extended supergravity models such massive multiplets could arise from. Our results show a clear connection of possible models with the five-dimensional extended supergravities...|$|R
