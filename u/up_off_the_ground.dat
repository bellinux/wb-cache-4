5|$|The quail is a {{small to}} medium-sized, cryptically {{coloured}} bird. In its natural environment, it is found in bushy places, in rough grassland, among agricultural crops, and in other places with dense cover. It feeds on seeds, insects, and other small invertebrates. Being a largely ground-dwelling, gregarious bird, domestication of the quail was not difficult, although many of its wild instincts are retained in captivity. It was known to the Egyptians long {{before the arrival of}} chickens and was depicted in hieroglyphs from 2575 BC. It migrated across Egypt in vast flocks and the birds could sometimes be picked <b>up</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> by hand. These were the common quail (Coturnix coturnix), but modern domesticated flocks are mostly of Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) which was probably domesticated as early as the 11th century AD in Japan. They were originally kept as songbirds, and they are thought to have been regularly used in song contests.|$|E
5|$|The flood made {{national}} news. The {{most familiar}} footage is possibly {{of the fire}} that started on April 19 in downtown Grand Forks, surrounded by floodwaters, where eleven buildings and sixty apartments were destroyed. The Grand Forks Herald building was totally destroyed in the fire, along with 120 years of archives. Firefighters {{were not able to}} begin extinguishing the fire immediately as they had to evacuate nearly forty people in one of the nearby apartment complexes who had defied the evacuation order. Additionally, their tankers were unable to reach the buildings due to the height of the floodwater and the water pressure from the hoses and fire hydrants was too weak to extinguish the flames. The National Guard placed the fire trucks on several tractor-trailers to prevent them from flooding, which allowed the firefighters to assist in extinguishing the fire. Also, two aircraft rescue and firefighting trucks from the Grand Forks International Airport were brought in to fight the fire because their engines were higher <b>up</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> and thus did not get clogged by the flood waters. The firefighters received assistance several hours after the fire started by a fire-bombing plane that dropped retardant and helicopters who made sixty drops totaling 120,000 gallons of water. Three of the firefighters were treated for hypothermia after treading through the cold temperatures of the flood water. The fire was later determined to have been caused by an electrical problem that had resulted from the large amounts of floodwater.|$|E

500|$|Unlike the Browns, the Braves were contenders {{all the way}} to the end of the 1948 season. In a {{game against}} the Philadelphia Phillies on 3 September, and with the Braves tied for the NL lead, Heath hit a two-run home run and the Braves went on to win the game, 3–1, and stayed in first place for the {{remainder}} of the regular season. With the Braves up five games in the NL standings and four games remaining on their regular season schedule, the Braves had a match-up with the Brooklyn Dodgers on 29 September but according to teammate Clint Conatser, Heath asked Braves manager Billy Southworth for the night off but his request was denied. During the game, Heath attempted to score from second base and slid towards home plate to try and beat the tag by Dodgers catcher Roy Campanella. As he slid, his foot got caught in the dirt which caused his ankle to twist. [...] "I began to slide about five feet from the plate. Funny thing, I generally get my spikes <b>up</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> but this time I didn't. I looked at my foot, which was twisted all the way around, and honestly I thought it would come right off", Heath said the next day from a local hospital. After playing in the majors for parts of 12 years, he would be forced to miss the World Series as it was later diagnosed he fractured his ankle. He called the broken ankle [...] "the biggest disappointment of my life." [...] A widely published newspaper photograph of the play showed Heath sliding toward the plate, mouth open in shock, with his leg bent mid-ankle with the lower ankle rotated ninety degrees to the upper ankle. He was quoted asking himself [...] "Why did I slide?" [...] when he was carried off the field on a stretcher and later put in an ambulance. In 1964, Heath said: ...|$|E
5000|$|... 1. In normal, {{unimpeded}} walking, TN activation {{during the}} transition from stance to swing should decrease as the foot begins to leave <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> In this case, increased TN stimulation would suggest scuffing of {{the bottom of the}} foot along <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>The</b> reflexive response will bring the foot <b>up,</b> pulling it <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> EMG responses to stimulation, again, help to explain how this is accomplished.|$|R
50|$|Descriptive norms depict what happens, while injunctive norms {{describe}} what should happen. Cialdini, Reno, and Kallgren (1990) define a descriptive norm as people's perceptions {{of what is}} commonly done in specific situations; it signifies what most people do, without assigning judgment. The absence of trash on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> in a parking lot, for example, transmits the descriptive norm that most people there do not litter. An Injunctive norm, on the other hand, transmits group approval about a particular behavior; it dictates how an individual should behave. Watching another person pick <b>up</b> trash <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and throw it out, a group member may {{pick up on the}} injunctive norm that he ought to not litter.|$|R

2500|$|Illegal {{equipment}}: Using {{equipment that}} does not meet regulations, either by size (length, width) or number (two sticks) or other guidelines (e.g. a goaltender's facemask {{can no longer be}} the [...] "Jason Voorhees"-style form-fit mask, a skater may not have a stick with a curve exceeding 3/4" [...] (19mm), nor may they play with a goaltender's stick. A goaltender may play with a regular player's stick.). If a player (non-goaltender) brakes a stick, it is mandatory to drop the stick immediately and play without it until getting a replacement from the bench. Otherwise this penalty will be assessed to the offending player (some game summaries call this [...] "playing with a broken stick"). In addition, in the NHL a player may not pick a broken stick <b>up</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> after it has been dropped (they can only receive a stick from another player or from the bench; goaltenders may not go to the bench but must have a stick carried out to them). This rule is generally not enforced in amateur leagues except for broken sticks or egregiously out-of-spec equipment, as the cost of acquiring gear that meets NHL specifications since a 2005 (and further in 2013) rule change is prohibitive, especially for goalies. Goaltenders will now receive a two-game suspension for the use of oversized equipment. Their teams will also be fined $25,000 and the trainer will be docked $10,000.|$|E

50|$|Some of {{the effects}} that {{concussion}} can cause to an individuals mind set can vary, depending on the circumstances and {{the severity of the}} impact. The common signs of concussion can be; blank look, slow to get <b>up</b> <b>off</b> of <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> unsteady on their feet, grabbing their head, confused in where they are or what they are doing, and obviously if they are unconscious. These are the things that a spectator, coach and medical assistant will notice in a player. Sometimes concussion can go unrecognised, so from a players point there can be these symptoms; continual headaches, dizziness, visual problems, feeling of fatigue and drowsiness. These all can occur post game, so a player needs to have knowledge of what these signs could mean.|$|R

60|$|Get clearly {{into your}} mind {{the nature of}} those two conditions. When a leaf is to be spread wide, like the Burdock, it is {{supported}} by a framework of extending ribs like a Gothic roof. The supporting function of these is geometrical; every one is constructed like the girders of a bridge, or beams of a floor, with all manner of science in the distribution of their substance in the section, for narrow and deep strength; and the shafts are mostly hollow. But when the extending space of a leaf is to be enriched with fulness of folds, and become beautiful in wrinkles, this may be done either by pure undulation as of a liquid current along the leaf edge, or by sharp 'drawing'--or 'gathering' I believe ladies would call it--and stitching of the edges together. And this stitching together, if to be done very strongly, is done round a bit of stick, as a sail is reefed round a mast; and this bit of stick needs to be compactly, not geometrically strong; its function is essentially that of starch,--not to hold the leaf <b>up</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> against gravity; but to stick the edges out, stiffly, in a crimped frill. And in beautiful work of {113} this kind, which we are meant to study, the stays of the leaf--or stay-bones--are finished off very sharply and exquisitely at the points; and indeed so much so, that they prick our fingers when we touch them; for they are not at all meant to be touched, but admired.|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to picking <b>up</b> objects <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> {{to use as}} weapons, Anne can find and use various other armaments including key cards and diskettes. In situations requiring button input (such as keypads), Anne will extend out one of her fingers. In keeping with the [...] "hyper realistic" [...] vision of the game, firearms have no cross-hairs, causing the player to first align the gun by adjusting Anne's wrist and then manually move her arm to aim at dinosaurs. Due to the non-traditional nature of the controls, inexperienced players may {{find it difficult to}} fire their weapons. Anne can carry up to two weapons at a time. Weapons have been made to incorporate realistic recoil, as if being held with two hands. Once each firearm is empty, it serves little use except as a club when swung. Empty weapons cannot be reloaded, and must be discarded and another one found. Hints and keypad codes appear in unexpected places on walls, often in a level or two before they are needed.|$|R
