25|$|Natural gums are {{vegetable}} exudates {{that are}} released {{as the result}} of damage to the plant such as that resulting from the attack of an insect or a natural or artificial cut. These exudates contain heterogeneous polysaccharides formed of different sugars and usually containing <b>uronic</b> acids. They form viscous colloidal solutions. There are different species that produce gums. The most important of these species belong to the leguminosae. They are widely used in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, food and textile sectors. They also have interesting therapeutic properties; for example gum arabic is antitussive and anti-inflammatory. The most well known gums are tragacanth (Astragalus gummifer), gum arabic (Acacia senegal) and guar gum (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba).|$|E
2500|$|Natural saccharides are {{generally}} built of simple carbohydrates called monosaccharides with general formula (CH2O)n where n is three or more. A typical monosaccharide has the structure H–(CHOH)x(C=O)–(CHOH)y–H, that is, an aldehyde or ketone with many hydroxyl groups added, usually {{one on each}} carbon atom that {{is not part of}} the aldehyde or ketone functional group. Examples of monosaccharides are glucose, fructose, and glyceraldehydes. However, some biological substances commonly called [...] "monosaccharides" [...] do not conform to this formula (e.g. <b>uronic</b> acids and deoxy-sugars such as fucose) and there are many chemicals that do conform to this formula but are not considered to be monosaccharides (e.g. formaldehyde CH2O and inositol (CH2O)6).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Uronic</b> acids (...) are a {{class of}} sugar acids with both {{carbonyl}} and carboxylic acid functional groups. They are sugars in which the terminal carbon's hydroxyl group has been oxidized to a carboxylic acid. Oxidation of the terminal aldehyde instead yields an aldonic acid, while oxidation of both the terminal hydroxyl group and the aldehyde yields an aldaric acid. The names of <b>uronic</b> acids are generally based on their parent sugars, for example, the <b>uronic</b> acid analog of glucose is glucuronic acid. <b>Uronic</b> acids derived from hexoses are known as hexuronic acids and <b>uronic</b> acids derived from pentoses are known as penturonic acids.|$|E
50|$|Hyaluronic acid {{is derived}} from hyalos (Greek for vitreous) and <b>uronic</b> acid because it was first {{isolated}} from the vitreous humour and possesses a high <b>uronic</b> acid content.|$|E
50|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of isomerases, {{specifically}} those intramolecular oxidoreductases interconverting aldoses and ketoses. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-glucuronate aldose-ketose-isomerase. Other names in common use include <b>uronic</b> isomerase, uronate isomerase, D-glucuronate isomerase, <b>uronic</b> acid isomerase, and D-glucuronate ketol-isomerase. This enzyme participates in pentose and glucuronate interconversions.|$|E

50|$|N-Acetyltalosaminuronic acid is a <b>uronic</b> acid. It is a {{component}} of pseudopeptidoglycan, a structural polymer found in the cell walls in some types of Archaea.|$|E
50|$|D-Galacturonic acid is a sugar acid, an {{oxidized}} form of D-galactose. It is {{the main}} component of pectin, in which it exists as the polymer polygalacturonic acid. In its open form, it has an aldehyde group at C1 and a carboxylic acid group at C6. Other oxidized forms of D-galactose are D-galactonic acid (carboxylic group at C1) and meso-galactaric acid (mucic acid) (carboxylic groups at C1 and C6). It is also a <b>uronic</b> acid or hexuronic acid. Naturally occurring <b>uronic</b> acids are D-glucuronic acid, D-galacturonic acid, L-iduronic acid and D-mannuronic acid.|$|E
50|$|Keratan sulfates have a {{variable}} sulfate content and, {{unlike many other}} GAGs, do not contain <b>uronic</b> acid. They {{are present in the}} cornea, cartilage, bones, and the horns of animals.|$|E
50|$|Pectins are {{a family}} of complex polysaccharides that contain 1,4-linked α-D-galactosyl <b>uronic</b> acid residues. They are present in most primary cell walls and in the non-woody parts of {{terrestrial}} plants.|$|E
50|$|It {{is used in}} biochemistry, {{since it}} has 20-26% content of protein, 32-36% of which are crude proteins. The plant also {{contains}} glucose (10-16%), rhamnose (36-40%), <b>uronic</b> acids (27-29%), and xylose (10-13%).|$|E
5000|$|There is no internationally {{accepted}} molecular {{standard for}} the composition of heparin, {{as it is a}} complex polymer of GAG units and <b>uronic</b> acids (including D-glucuronic acid, L-iduronic acid, and D-glucosamine). Position of N-acetyl, N-sulfate, and O-sulfate groups in these <b>uronic</b> acids can vary, as can the branching patterns of the chain. This generates an extraordinary amount of variability between molecules of heparin. [...] Current USP standards for heparin limit levels of contamination with dermatan, chondroitin, and over-sulfonated chondroitin sulfate, as well as galactosamine levels in the sample, as determined by HPLC, H-NMR, and Strong Anion Exchange Chromatography.|$|E
50|$|The gum {{contains}} 5.4% ash, 0.98% N, 1.49% methoxyl, and by calculation, 32.2% <b>uronic</b> acid. The sugar composition after hydrolysis: 9.0% 4-0-methylglucuronic acid, 23.2% glucuronic acid, 56% galactose, 10% arabinose, and 2% rhamnose.|$|E
50|$|Aprotinin can be {{labelled}} with fluorescein isothiocyanate.

It also produces crude enzyme when its mixed with linoleic acid which is widely used to fight influenza.|$|E
5000|$|Glucuronic acid (from Ancient Greek γλυκύς [...] "sweet" [...] + οὖρον [...] "urine") is a <b>uronic</b> acid {{that was}} first {{isolated}} from urine (hence the name). It {{is found in}} many gums such as gum arabic (c. 18%) and xanthan, and {{is important for the}} metabolism of microorganisms, plants and animals.|$|E
50|$|Another type of {{cellular}} glycan is the glycosaminoglycans. These comprise 2-aminosugars linked in an alternating fashion with <b>uronic</b> acids, and include polymers such as heparin, heparan sulfate, chondroitin, keratan, and dermatan. Some glycosaminoglycans are found {{attached to the}} cell surface, where they are linked through a single xylosyl residue to a protein (forming a glycoprotein).|$|E
50|$|Heparin {{was first}} {{isolated}} from dog liver by medical student Jay McClean in 1916. Jorpes discovered {{the structure of}} the heparin polysaccharide in 1935, identifying that it is a highly sulfonated polymer of glycosaminoglycoglycan (GAG) and <b>uronic</b> acid. Around that time, heparin began {{to be used in the}} prophylaxis and treatment of post-operative thrombosis.|$|E
50|$|Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) or mucopolysaccharides {{are long}} {{unbranched}} polysaccharides {{consisting of a}} repeating disaccharide unit. The repeating unit (except for keratan) consists of an amino sugar (N-acetylglucosamine or N-acetylgalactosamine) along with a <b>uronic</b> sugar (glucuronic acid or iduronic acid) or galactose. Glycosaminoglycans are highly polar and attract water. They are therefore useful to the body as a lubricant or as a shock absorber.|$|E
5000|$|An aldonic acid is any of {{a family}} of sugar acids {{obtained}} by oxidation of the aldehyde functional group of an aldose to form a carboxylic acid functional group. [...] Thus, their general chemical formula is HOOC-(CHOH)n-CH2OH. Oxidation of the terminal hydroxyl group instead of the terminal aldehyde yields a <b>uronic</b> acid, while oxidation of both terminal ends yields an aldaric acid.|$|E
50|$|Chondroitin sulfate {{proteoglycans}} {{are composed}} of a core protein and a sugar side chain. The core protein is generally a glycoprotein, and the side chains are glycosaminoglycan (GAG) sugar chains attached through a covalent bond. The GAG side chains are of different lengths depending on the CSPG. Each GAG chain consists of a linear pattern of alternating monosaccharide units: <b>uronic</b> acid and either N-acetylglucosamine or N-acetylgalactosamine.|$|E
50|$|An aldaric acid is an aldose {{in which}} both the {{hydroxyl}} function of the terminal carbon and the aldehyde function of the first carbon have been fully oxidized to carboxylic acid functions. (Oxidation of just the aldehyde yields an aldonic acid while oxidation of just the terminal hydroxyl group yields an <b>uronic</b> acid.) Aldaric acids cannot form cyclic hemiacetals like unoxidized sugars, but they can sometimes form lactones.|$|E
50|$|Idose is a hexose, a six carbon monosaccharide. It has an {{aldehyde}} {{group and}} is an aldose. It is not found in nature, but its <b>uronic</b> acid, iduronic acid, is important. It is a component of dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate, which are glycosaminoglycans. The first and third hydroxyls point the opposite way from the second and fourth. It is made by aldol condensation of D- and L-glyceraldehyde. L-Idose is a C-5 epimer of D-glucose.|$|E
50|$|Normal urine {{contains}} chelating agents, such as citrate, that {{inhibit the}} nucleation, growth, and aggregation of calcium-containing crystals. Other endogenous inhibitors include calgranulin (an S-100 calcium binding protein), Tamm-Horsfall protein, glycosaminoglycans, uropontin (a form of osteopontin), nephrocalcin (an acidic glycoprotein), prothrombin F1 peptide, and bikunin (<b>uronic</b> acid-rich protein). The biochemical mechanisms of action of these substances {{have not yet}} been thoroughly elucidated. However, when these substances fall below their normal proportions, stones can form from an aggregation of crystals.|$|E
50|$|Winchester {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} congenital connective tissue disease described in 1969, of which the main characteristics are short stature, marked contractures of joints, opacities in the cornea, a coarse face, dissolution of the carpal and tarsal bones (in the hands and feet, respectively) and osteoporosis. Appearances resemble rheumatoid arthritis. Increased <b>uronic</b> acid is demonstrated in cultured fibroblasts from the skin {{and to a lesser}} degree in both parents. Despite initial tests not showing increased mucopolysaccharide excretion, the disease was regarded as a mucopolysaccharidosis.|$|E
50|$|Chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate, which {{comprise}} CSGAGs, are differentiated {{from each}} other {{by the presence of}} GlcA and IdoA epimers respectively. Similar to the production of HSGAGs, C-5 uronyl epimerase converts d-GlcA to l-IdoA to synthesize dermatan sulfate. Three sulfation events of the CSGAG chains occur: 4-O and/or 6-O sulfation of GalNAc and 2-O sulfation of <b>uronic</b> acid. Four isoforms of the 4-O GalNAc sulfotransferases (C4ST-1, C4ST-2, C4ST-3, and D4ST-1) and three isoforms of the GalNAc 6-O sulfotransferases (C6ST, C6ST-2, and GalNAc4S-6ST) are responsible for the sulfation of GalNAc.|$|E
5000|$|L-Iduronic acid (IdoA) is {{the major}} <b>uronic</b> acid {{component}} of the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) dermatan sulfate, and heparin. It is also present in heparan sulfate although here in a minor amount relative to its carbon-5 epimer glucuronic acid. [...] IdoA is a hexapyranose sugar. Most hexapyranoses are stable {{in one of two}} chair conformations 1C4 or 4C1. L-iduronate is different and adopts more than one solution conformation, with an equilibrium existing between three low-energy conformers. These are the 1C4 and 4C1 chair forms and an additional 2S0 skew-boat conformation.|$|E
50|$|Considering {{the animal}} source of {{pharmaceutical}} heparin, {{the numbers of}} potential impurities are relatively large compared with a wholly synthetic therapeutic agent. The range of possible biological contaminants includes viruses, bacterial endotoxins, transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) agents, lipids, proteins, and DNA. During the preparation of pharmaceutical-grade heparin from animal tissues, impurities such as solvents, heavy metals, and extraneous cations can be introduced. However, the methods employed to minimize the occurrence and to identify and/or eliminate these contaminants are well established and listed in guidelines and pharmacopoeias. The major challenge {{in the analysis of}} heparin impurities is the detection and identification of structurally related impurities. The most prevalent impurity in heparin is dermatan sulfate (DS), also known as chondroitin sulfate B. The building-block of DS is a disaccharide composed of 1,3-linked N-acetyl galactosamine (GalN) and a <b>uronic</b> acid residue, connected via 1,4 linkages to form the polymer. DS is composed of three possible <b>uronic</b> acid (GlcA, IdoA or IdoA2S) and four possible hexosamine (GalNAc, Gal- NAc4S, GalNAc6S, or GalNAc4S6S) building-blocks. The presence of iduronic acid in DS distinguishes it from chrondroitin sulfate A and C and likens it to heparin and HS. DS has a lower negative charge density overall compared to heparin. A common natural contaminant, DSis present at levels of 1-7% in heparin API, but has no proven biological activity that influences the anticoagulation effect of heparin.|$|E
50|$|With {{regards to}} HSGAGs, a multimeric enzyme encoded by EXT1 and EXT2 of the EXT family of genes, {{transfers}} both GlcNAc and GlcA for HSGAG chain elongation. While elongating, the HSGAG is dynamically modified, first by N-deacetylase, N-sulfotransferase (NDST1), {{which is a}} bifunctional enzyme that cleaves the N-acetyl group from GlcNAc and subsequently sulfates the N-position. Next, C-5 uronyl epimerase coverts d-GlcA to l-IdoA followed by 2-O sulfation of the <b>uronic</b> acid sugar by 2-O sulfotransferase (Heparan sulfate 2-O-sulfotransferase). Finally, the 6-O and 3-O positions of GlcNAc moities are sulfated by 6-O (Heparan sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase) and 3-O (3-OST) sulfotransferases.|$|E

5000|$|Proteoglycans are {{proteins}} that are heavily glycosylated. The basic proteoglycan unit {{consists of a}} [...] "core protein" [...] {{with one or more}} covalently attached glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chain(s). The point of attachment is a serine (Ser) residue to which the glycosaminoglycan is joined through a tetrasaccharide bridge (e.g. chondroitin sulfate-GlcA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-PROTEIN). The Ser residue is generally in the sequence -Ser-Gly-X-Gly- (where X can be any amino acid residue but proline), although not every protein with this sequence has an attached glycosaminoglycan. The chains are long, linear carbohydrate polymers that are negatively charged under physiological conditions due to the occurrence of sulfate and <b>uronic</b> acid groups. Proteoglycans occur in the connective tissue.|$|E
