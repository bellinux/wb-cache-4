500|$|Prosecutors {{agreed that}} Cisneros was guilty {{under the law}} of the parties - that she was guilty of the crime of murder even though she did not commit the crime directly. However, {{prosecutors}} failed to word her charge appropriately, suggesting that Cisneros [...] "directly" [...] hired Puentes Pizaña and Olivarez to murder Fischer instead of working through intermediaries. On February 14, a state appeals court in Corpus Christi ordered Cisneros released on a US$50,000 bond, about one-sixth of the original bond posted for her trial. The order stated that the prosecution did not agree to the bail, but the document stated they had failed to file the appropriate paperwork within the mandatory ten days. On February 22, a judge ordered her released from prison. She was <b>unavailable</b> <b>for</b> <b>comment,</b> and it was not known if she returned to Brownsville. Fischer's family denounced the ruling and said the appeals court [...] "seemed to have lost sight" [...] that their son was killed. Brownsville prosecutors said even if there was not enough evidence to convict Cisneros for capital murder, she could still be convicted of ordinary murder, since the appeal was approved because there was no direct evidence linking Cisneros with a murder-for-hire charge. The reversal was upheld by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in November 1996.|$|E

When the Associated Press asked Tony Bradlee about the affair, she responded: [...] "I knew nothing about it when Mary was alive. I have no further comment." [...] She also told The Washington Post: [...] "The National Enquirer quoted my words out of context to make it appear as though I corroborated their story." [...] Angleton acknowledged that Meyer had been a [...] "cherished friend" [...] to him and his wife and that he had assisted her family after her death in a [...] "purely private capacity", but refused to say whether there had been a diary. According to the Post, an unidentified source said that Meyer's diary was found, primarily discussing art along with a vague reference to an unnamed friend, then destroyed in keeping with her wishes.|$|E
