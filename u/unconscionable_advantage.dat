40|$|Comparative Law {{means not}} only {{travelling}} in space, but travelling in time as well. It’s {{the essence of}} legal evolution: Law undergoes changes in different countries at different times. The story of inequality of exchange serves as a good example. Inequality in exchange as a legal figure of the old Roman laesio enormis {{has long been a}} popular topic for comparative studies. However, the comparison was mostly limited to the French, German and English legal systems, even though they form model solutions for their legal families. In the historical perspective, it meant tracing the legal evolution of laesio enormis and the unfair <b>advantage</b> (<b>unconscionable</b> contract) until the implementation of the German BGB in 1900 only. But it is not how the whole story goes. This paper aims at showing how Comparative Law has served to shape the legal consequences of unfair advantage in the 20 th century. Its modern “legal geography” is a perspective of so called “derived legal systems”: the Swiss, the Polish, the Italian and the Dutch. Each of them marks a new stage in the legal evolution of the institution of unfair advantage. The path of development starts from the Swiss Code of Obligations of 1911 and proceeds gradually towards the soft law of the 21 st century. Its main feature is the striving for more flexibility meaning favour of private autonomy and certainty of contractual relations...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} a mixed {{approach to the}} theme of the instrumentality of law by both analysing the goal of a legal transformation and the techniques adapted to achieve it. The correct recognition of a certain practical necessity has lead the Swiss Federal Tribunal to an intriguing judgement “Fussballclub Lohn-Fall” of 1997. The legal remedies provided for cases of unfair advantage have been then creatively modified praeter legem. The adaptation was strongly influenced by foreign legal patterns. The Swiss Code of Obligations of 1911 provides a norm in art. 21 on unfair <b>advantage</b> (<b>unconscionable</b> contract), prescribing that if one party takes unjustified advantage over the weaknesses of another in order to receive an excessive benefit, such a contract is avoidable. Its wording has been shaped over a hundred years ago and still remains intact. However, {{over the course of the}} 20 th century the necessity for a more efficient protection has arisen. The legal doctrine and jurisprudence were constantly pointing out the incompleteness of the remedies provided by art. 21 of the Code of Obligations. In the “Fussballclub Lohn-Fall” (BGE 123 III 292) the Swiss Federal Tribunal finally introduced the possibility to modify the contract. Its decision has been described as “a sign of the zeitgeist, spirit of the time”. It was the Swiss legal doctrine that has imposed the new measure under the influence of the German “quantitative Teilnichtigkeit” (quantitative partial nullity). The historical heritage of the Roman laesio enormis has also played its role...|$|R
50|$|Unconscionability is {{determined}} by examining {{the circumstances of the}} parties when the contract was made, such as their bargaining power, age, and mental capacity. Other issues might include lack of choice, superior knowledge, and other obligations or circumstances surrounding the bargaining process. Unconscionable conduct is also found in acts of fraud and deceit, where the deliberate misrepresentation of fact deprives someone of a valuable possession. When a party takes <b>unconscionable</b> <b>advantage</b> of another, the action may be treated as criminal fraud or the civil action of deceit.|$|E

I am {{not sure}} whether it is {{possible}} to classify all of the cases in which the courts have been or should be prepared to disregard the separate legal personality of a company neatly into cases of either concealment or evasion. They may simply be examples of the principle that the individuals who operate limited companies {{should not be allowed to}} take <b>unconscionable</b> <b>advantage</b> of the people with whom they do business. But what the cases do have in common is that the separate legal personality is being disregarded in order to obtain a remedy against someone other than the company in respect of a liability which would otherwise be that of the company alone (if it existed at all). In the converse case, where it is sought to convert the personal liability of the owner or controller into a liability of the company, it is usually more appropriate to rely upon the concepts of agency and of the [...] "directing mind".93. What we have in this case is a desire to disregard the separate legal personality of the companies in order to impose upon the companies a liability which can only be that of the husband personally. This is not a liability under the general law, for example for breach of contract. It is a very specific statutory power to order one spouse to transfer property to which he is legally entitled to the other spouse. The argument is that that is a power which can, because the husband owns and controls these companies, be exercised against the companies themselves. I find it difficult to understand how that can be done unless the company is a mere nominee holding the property on trust for the husband, as we have found to be the case with the properties in issue here. I would be surprised if that were not often the case.|$|E
30|$|Intentional {{islanding}} is {{the process}} of intentionally splitting the grid into separate controllable islands [10]. Deliberate islanding is primarily implemented for averting cascading and blackouts- the two perils to the security of power system. Intentional islanding negates the losses of inadvertent islanding. Intentional islanding may be employed to enhance the voltage profiles and decrease power losses, improve the overall efficiency of the system by controlling the congestion of distribution and transmission system. Therefore, intentional islanding operation can be a viable option if enforced through a proper envelope of research. Various researchers are working on the issues related to intentional islanding in order to eliminate its shortcomings making it practically applicable [11]. Islanding in the correct time and in the correct manner has inspired many works. After proper islanding, the frequency and voltages should be within the prescribed limit to avoid further blackouts [12]. Moreover, intentional islanding will {{have a significant effect on}} the electricity prices in the dynamic market [13]. During intentional islanding, several islands will have their own price and the producers can take <b>unconscionable</b> <b>advantage</b> by spiking the prices. Hence these practices should be properly checked. However, they may also give choice to customers whether to buy electricity or not under this condition [13].|$|E
