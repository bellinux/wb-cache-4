The facility is located approximately 800 km north of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, on the northeast edge of the uranium rich Athabasca Basin. The closest community is Wollaston Lake, about 40 kilometers by lake or air. Rabbit Lake was the first Canadian mine to offer a seven-days-in/seven-days-out commuter system of staffing.Access is provided by Highway 905. Production at Rabbit Lake was suspended in April 2016.|$|E
5000|$|Sellersville {{was founded}} in the early 18th century. It was {{centered}} on a major road known as Bethlehem Pike that connected Philadelphia to Bethlehem {{and the rest of}} what was then far Western Pennsylvania. The town was very small and was called Sellers Tavern. Its most notable feature was a large inn. The present Washington House in Sellersville, however, was not Sellers Tavern. The town grew slowly over the years until the Industrial Revolution. In the 1860s the North Pennsylvania Railroad was built, running parallel to Bethlehem Pike: this stimulated the growth of light textile industries and brought a wave of population growth. The East Branch of the Perkiomen Creek runs through the town which connects it to an adjacent town of Perkasie. This creek was dammed in the early 20th century creating a small body of water known as Lake Lenape. Along the length of the lake a park was built on Perkasie and Sellersville lands. In the 1920s and 1930s this park housed a carousel, a roller coaster and several other amusements. The railroad brought hundreds of people from Philadelphia in the summer time, and it became a well known vacation spot for blue collar city workers. The town was also home to the Radium Company of America, which was the largest <b>uranium</b> <b>milling</b> <b>facility</b> in the world at the time. A business operating under the name of the United States Gauge Company originated in Sellersville in 1904 and allegedly became a prominent manufacturer of gauges for military use, many of which were coated with radium-based paint for nighttime luminesence. The company later became instrumental in the production of nuclear weapons, leaving behind a legacy of industrial and radioactive contamination that has been well-hidden by local, county, state, and federal government agencies for decades. [...] Today the town is still relatively small, sandwiched in between a ridge line and the larger town of Perkasie. The center of town still runs along Bethlehem Pike which is now called Old Route 309. The Washington House has recently been restored to become an upscale restaurant. Next door to the restaurant was a livery stable, which was converted into a theater (later a movie theater) in 1894. It has since been restored, and reopened in 2001 as Sellersville Theater 1894- a popular live music venue. The creek is still dammed but only the carousel in Perkasie remains of the amusements. The textile industry has long moved out of the area and Sellersville has become mainly a residential town for people working in the many urban centers that are only a short commute away. Grand View Hospital, Bucks County’s first hospital, has provided residents of Bucks and Montgomery counties with comprehensive healthcare services since 1913. The town is surrounded on three sides by open country and spread out housing developments. The local firehouse provides various activities throughout the year, including a carnival in the summer. The Holiday House Pool and Recreation Center becomes a hotspot for people to escape the heat during the summer as well. There are various business along Main Street one of which is the Washington House. This strip of businesses along Main Street provide some jobs as well, but largely the town remains a residential area. There is a Sellersville Museum off of Main Street which displays different exhibits every month.|$|E

40|$|The MILDOS Computer Code {{estimates}} impacts from radioactive {{emissions from}} <b>uranium</b> <b>milling</b> <b>facilities.</b> These impacts {{are presented as}} dose commitments to individuals and the regional population within an 80 km radius of the facility. Only airborne releases of radioactive materials are considered: releases to surface water and to groundwater are not addressed in MILDOS. This code is multi-purposed {{and can be used}} to evaluate population doses for NEPA assessments, maximum individual doses for predictive 40 CFR 190 compliance evaluations, or maximum offsite air concentrations for predictive evaluations of 10 CFR 20 compliance. Emissions of radioactive materials from fixed point source locations and from area sources are modeled using a sector-averaged Gaussian plume dispersion model, which utilizes user-provided wind frequency data. Mechanisms such as deposition of particulates, resuspension. radioactive decay and ingrowth of daughter radionuclides are included in the transport model. Annual average air concentrations are computed, from which subsequent impacts to humans through various pathways are computed. Ground surface concentrations are estimated from deposition buildup and ingrowth of radioactive daughters. The surface concentrations are modified by radioactive decay, weathering and other environmental processes. The MILDOS Computer Code allows the user to vary the emission sources as a step function of time by adjustinq the emission rates. which includes shutting them off completely. Thus the results of a computer run can be made to reflect changing processes throughout the facility&#x 27;s operational lifetime. The pathways considered for individual dose commitments and for population impacts are: • Inhalation • External exposure from ground concentrations • External exposure from cloud immersion • Ingestioo of vegetables • Ingestion of meat • Ingestion of milk • Dose commitments are calculated using dose conversion factors, which are ultimately based on recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). These factors are fixed internally in the code, and {{are not part of the}} input option. Dose commitments which are available from the code are as follows: • Individual dose commitments for use in predictive 40 CFR 190 compliance evaluations (Radon and short-lived daughters are excluded) • Total individual dose commitments (impacts from all available radionuclides are considered) • Annual population dose commitments (regional, extraregional, total and cummulative).

The international River Águeda, a tributary to River Douro, has also important <b>uranium</b> mining and <b>milling</b> <b>facilities</b> in its catchment basin in Spain. In order to assess the radioactive contamination of these river basinsresulting from uranium mining waste, uranium series radionuclides were measured in water, suspended particulate matter, and riverbed sediments.

This contamination persisted long time after environmental remediation implemented at some mine sites and cessation of mine discharges.

40|$|After {{more than}} 35 years {{operation}} the <b>uranium</b> mining and <b>milling</b> <b>facilities</b> near Pécs city in Hungary were finally {{shut down in}} 1997. One {{of the most important}} and most complicated tasks is the remediation of tailings ponds because of the complexity of chemical, radiological and geotechnical requirements of the restoration. Tailings ponds are potential sources of radiactive contaminants through both aerial and terrestrial pathways. The potential risk of environmental contamination from the latter route has been substantially decreased by pretreatment of the soil (liming) before construction. The main task of the restoration now is to decrease radon emanation and wind erosion of the ponds, to give geotechnical stability and environmental friendly shape to the resulting pile and to prevent soil erosion from the slopes. In the first pilot study concrete rings of 1 m diameter filled with test layers of different materials were used for in situ examination of radon infiltration. In total 11 columns were studied, including the uncovered pond as a reference point. Radon concentrations of the layers were measured by monitors equipped with scintillation soil probe, and in parallel radon flux was measured on the top of each column.
