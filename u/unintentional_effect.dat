50|$|After a few years, it {{was decided}} that the hassle of dealing with noise {{transmission}} between classrooms wasn't worth the positive effects of collaboration. Walls were built to divide the classrooms in 1980, and remain today. Because the school was designed to be open, adding walls where needed has the <b>unintentional</b> <b>effect</b> of making the building especially difficult to navigate. It is easy to spot the walls that were subsequently added, as all the permanent walls in the building as originally built are concrete block, while those added later are made of drywall. Additionally, to cut costs, the ceiling tiles and grid were not rebuilt to accommodate the new walls, which makes for a small gap at the top and reduces noise insulation. Some of the lockers were painted a neutral beige color, while others were painted dark blue (one of the school colors). With the Columbus City Schools switch to Middle schools from the Junior High setup, 9th graders began to be admitted in the fall of 1980.|$|E

50|$|Desirable and {{undesirable}} effects are often closely intertwined whereby {{the first is}} usually intentionally designed, while the latter might be an <b>unintentional</b> <b>effect.</b> For example, the impact of cars has been profound in enhancing social mobility on the one hand, while transforming cities and increasing resource demand and pollution on the other. The first is generally regarded as a positive effect. The impact of associated road building on cities, however, has largely had a detrimental impact on the living environment. Furthermore, resource use and pollution associated with cars and their infrastructure have prompted a rethinking of human behaviour and the technology used, {{as part of the}} sustainable design movement, resulting for example in schemes promoting less travel or alternative transport such as trains and bike riding. Similar effects, sometimes desirable, sometimes undesirable can be observed in other areas including health, safety and social spheres. For example, mobile phones and computers have transformed the speed and social code of communication, leading not only to an increased ability to communicate, but also to an increase in stress levels {{with a wide range of}} health impacts and to safety issues.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>unintentional</b> <b>effect</b> {{of these}} {{measures}} to defend the [...] "state within a state" [...] by [...] "self-Gleichschaltung" [...] was to ultimately weaken such a status.

Bartov wrote about the new sort of technocratic officers and their views about the Nazi regime:The combined gratification of personal ambitions, technological obsessions and nationalist aspirations greatly enhanced their identification with Hitler's regime as individuals, professionals, representatives of a caste and leaders of a vast conscript army. Men such as Beck and Guderian, Manstein and Rommel, Doenitz and Kesselring, Milch and Udet cannot be described as mere soldiers strictly devoted to their profession, rearmament and the autonomy of the military establishment while remaining indifferent to and detached from Nazi rule and ideology. The many points of contact between Hitler and his young generals were thus important elements in the integration of the Wehrmacht into the Third Reich, in stark contradiction of its image as a [...] "haven" [...] from Nazism.|$|E

Identification of {{management}} strategies to enhance populations, such as predator management, {{may be needed}} to reduce further declines, but <b>unintentional</b> <b>effects</b> associated with increased human activity should also be considered. We evaluated the effect of 3 levels of predator management effort on greater sage-grouse space use. Home range size, movement rate, seasonal movement timing, and inter-seasonal distances traveled were examined as behavioral responses relative to levels of coyote removal in Bighorn Basin, Wyoming. We observed larger home range sizes during brood-rearing but overall smaller annual core (25 % density kernel) sizes with higher levels of predator management. We observed higher movement rates, farther inter-seasonal distances traveled, and higher proportions of sage-grouse making inter-seasonal movements with increased predator removal effort. Our fi dings suggest activities like predator management may influence behavioral and spatial aspects of sage-grouse ecology. Management actions must consider the direct and indirect effects actions taken to improve a population’s growth will have on behavior, habitat use, and ultimately, long-term persistence...|$|R
40|$|Studies that {{approach}} {{the deployment of}} new technologies as social experiments have mostly focused on <b>unintentional</b> <b>effects,</b> notably safety. We argue {{for the inclusion of}} adversarial risks or security aspects that are the result of intentional, strategic behavior of actors, who aim at using the technology for their own purposes. Examples include cybercrime and terrorist use of materials obtained from nuclear facilities. Our general question is how the approach of new technologies as social experiments can be adapted or extended to account for such aspects. To this end, we re-interpret adversarial risks in social experiments in terms of actor-network theory, highlighting how intentional actions involving new technologies are different from unintentional events, by focusing on how actors form new networks with new technologies (composition), thus enabling new programs of action (translation). We also derive a typology of ways in which intentional (mis) use of new technologies creates risks, using the Bitcoin distributed currency as an example. Both contribute to conceptualizing adversarial risks in social experiments, as well as laying bare options for learning about adversarial risks during such experiments...|$|R

40|$|Understanding of {{agricultural}} systems {{has been an}} accepted and necessary aspect of a child’s education for centuries. Conventional agricultural education has proven effective in creating well-trained agricultural professionals and scholars, but has had the <b>unintentional</b> <b>effect</b> of limiting access to agricultural concepts to the non-agricultural student. This effect has potentially negative cultural consequences considering the importance agricultural issues. In response, agricultural educators have carried out an initiative to promote agricultural literacy in the classroom through an integration {{of agricultural}} concepts into core curriculum.

40|$|Since the {{standard}} model of income tax evasion (Allingham & Sandmo, 1972; Srinivasan, 1973) was published, much research has tested its four parameters (level of actual income, tax rate, audit probability, penalty rate) for empirical validity. Surveys, laboratory experiments and analysis of aggregate data revealed ambiguous evidence for the model’s behavioral implications. The present article reviews these studies and concludes that compliance decisions can only partly {{be explained by the}} rational choice approach. We suggest that depending on the climate in a society, compliance stems from two different factors. In a climate of distrust, high power of authorities is needed to enforce tax compliance and increasing fines and audit probabilities may be an effective tax policy. In a climate where taxpayers trust the authorities of their state, however, other variables gain in importance. Knowledge, attitudes, moral appeals, fairness and democracy may lead to voluntary compliance. In this case, draconian fines and intrusive audits can take <b>unintentional</b> <b>effects</b> and would corrupt tax morale. compliance decisions, tax evasion, audits, fines, trust...|$|R
