5000|$|To {{cope with}} skiing the steep terrain (greater than 50 degrees), Vallençant {{developed}} a new turning technique, known as the [...] "Pedal-Jump Turn" [...] (also [...] "Pedal Hop Turn" [...] and [...] "Pedal Step Turn"). The technique involved pushing off from the <b>uphill</b> <b>ski,</b> away from the slope and completing a portion of turn's rotation while {{in the air and}} then landing back on the downhill ski. With the advent of parabolic skis, using the <b>uphill</b> <b>ski</b> to initiate a turn is now a common technique for carved turns and racing. The key difference is in carving or racing the skier is traveling much faster, the terrain is not as steep and {{there is no need for}} such a dramatic thrust off the slope. The [...] "Pedal-Jump Turn" [...] was originally developed on traditional racing skis.|$|E

50|$|The {{snowplough}} turn, {{also known}} as a wedge turn or the pizza slice, is a downhill skiing braking and turning technique taught to beginners. The front ski tips of the skis are together and the tails wide apart, with the knees rolled inwards slightly. By applying pressure against the snow with the inside edges of the skis speed is reduced, making turning in such a configuration and stopping completely possible. To turn, weight is shifted from the downhill, outside-of-the-turn <b>ski</b> to the <b>uphill,</b> inside-of-the-turn <b>ski.</b> As the turn is completed, the old <b>uphill,</b> inside <b>ski</b> then becomes the new downhill, outside ski.|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} an {{algorithm}} {{designed for the}} diagonal stride in classical cross-country skiing was adapted to compute spatio-temporal parameters for <b>uphill</b> <b>ski</b> mountaineering using a ski fixed inertial sensor. Cycle duration, thrust duration, cycle speed, cycle distance, elevation gain, and slope angle were computed and validated against a marker-based motion capture system during indoor treadmill skiing. Skiing movement of 12 experienced, recreational level athletes was measured for nine different speed and slope angle combinations. The accuracy (i. e. mean error) and precision (i. e. standard deviation of the error) were below 3 ms and 13 ms for the cycle duration and thrust duration, respectively. Accuracy (precision) for cycle speed, cycle distance and elevation gain were - 0. 013 m/s (0. 032 m/s), - 0. 027 m (0. 018 m), and 0. 006 m (0. 011 m), respectively. Slope angle accuracy and precision were 0. 40 ° and 0. 32 °, respectively. If the cross-country skiing algorithm would be used without adaptations, errors {{would be up to}} one order of magnitude larger. The adapted algorithm proved valid for measuring spatio-temporal parameters for ski-mountaineering on treadmill. It is expected that the algorithm shows similar performance on snow...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{describe}} the effects of speed and gradient during <b>uphill</b> <b>ski</b> mountaineering on energy expenditure, to relate any changes to changes in stride characteristics, and to determine an optimal gradient and speed allowing minimization of energy expenditure. 11 subjects were tested on snowy trails using their mountaineering skis (fitted with skins), boots and poles, at three gradients (7, 11 and 33  %) at 80  % of maximum heart rate (HRmax), and at 11  % also at 90 and 100  % of HRmax. Energy expenditure was calculated by indirect calorimetry to derive energy cost of locomotion (EC), vertical energy cost (ECvert) and mechanical efficiency, while stride length, stride frequency, relative and absolute thrust phase duration, and slope gradient were measured with an inertial sensor-based system. At 11  % there was no change with speed in EC, ECvert and mechanical efficiency, while stride length and frequency increased and absolute thrust phase duration decreased. There was an effect of gradient on EC, ECvert and mechanical efficiency, while speed, stride length and stride frequency decreased and absolute and relative thrust phase duration increased. The most economical gradient (lowest ECvert) was the steepest one. During ski mountaineering uphill at shallow gradient (11  %), EC, ECvert and mechanical efficiency do not vary with speed, while at steeper gradient (33  %) economy is improved. It follows that to minimize energy expenditure and optimize performance to reach a place located at a higher altitude, an athlete should choose a steep gradient, if he/she is able to maintain a sufficient speed...|$|E
50|$|Downhill skiing only {{developed}} as a separate sport after {{the introduction of the}} ski lift. Prior to this, almost all skiing involved a mix of cross-country, downhill and even <b>uphill</b> <b>skiing.</b> For cross-country, the efficient striding motion requires the heel of the boot to lift from the ski, allowing the leg to lag behind the body as the other ski is moved forward. In the late 1880s, a number of bindings using a leather strap over the toe and a second one pulling the boot forward under the toe strap were common. These kept the toe of the boot on the ski, while allowing the heel to rise some distance.|$|R

40|$|Cross-country (c. c.) {{skiing is}} a complex sport {{discipline}} from both physiological and biomechanical perspectives, with varying course topographies that require different proportions of the involved sub-techniques to be utilised. A relatively new event in c. c. skiing is the sprint race, involving four separate heats, each lasting 2 - 4 min, with diverse demands from distance races associated with longer durations. Therefore, the overall aim of the current thesis has been to examine the biomechanical and physiological factors associated with sprint c. c. skiing performance through novel measurements conducted both in the field (Studies I-III) and the laboratory (Studies IV and V). In Study I sprint skiing velocities and sub-techniques were analysed with a differential global navigation satellite system in combination with video recording. In Studies II and III the effects of an increasing velocity (moderate, high and maximal) on the biomechanics of <b>uphill</b> classical <b>skiing</b> with the diagonal stride (DS) (Study II) and herringbone (HB) (Study III) sub-techniques were examined. In Study I the skiers completed the 1, 425 m (2 x 712 m) sprint time trial (STT) in 207 s, at an average velocity of 24. 8 km/h, with multiple technique transitions (range: 21 - 34) between skiing techniques (i. e., the different gears [G 2 - 7]). A pacing strategy involving a fast start followed by a gradual slowing down (i. e., positive pacing) was employed {{as indicated by the}} 2. 9 % faster first than second lap. The slower second lap was primarily related to a slower (12. 9 %) uphill velocity with a shift from G 3 towards a greater use of G 2. The maximal oxygen uptake (O 2 max) was related to the ability to maintain <b>uphill</b> <b>skiing</b> velocity and the fastest skiers used G 3 {{to a greater extent than}} G 2. In addition, maximal speed over short distances (50 and 20 m) with the G 3 and double poling (DP) sub-techniques exerted an important impact on STT performance. Study II demonstrated that during <b>uphill</b> <b>skiing</b> (7. 5 °) with DS, skiers increased cycle rate and cycle length from moderate to high velocity, while cycle rate increased and cycle length decreased at maximal velocity. Absolute poling, gliding and kick times became gradually shorter with an elevated velocity. The rate of pole and leg force development increased with elevated velocity and the development of leg force in the normal direction was substantially faster during skiing on snow than previous findings for roller skiing, although the peak force was similar in both cases. The fastest skiers applied greater peak leg forces over shorter durations. Study III revealed that when employing the HB technique on a steep uphill slope (15 °), the skiers positioned their skis laterally (“V” between 25 to 30 °) and planted their poles at a slight lateral angle (8 to 12 °), with most of the propulsive force being exerted on the inside forefoot. Of the total propulsive force, 77 % was generated by the legs. The cycle rate increased across all three velocities (from 1. 20 to 1. 60 Hz), while cycle length only increased from moderate to high velocity (from 2. 0 to 2. 3 m). Finally, the magnitude and rate of leg force generation are important determinants of both DS and HB skiing performance, although the rate is more important in connection with DS, since this sub-technique involves gliding. In Studies IV and V skiers performed pre-tests for determination of gross efficiency (GE), O 2 max, and Vmax on a treadmill. The main performance test involved four self-paced STTs on a treadmill over a 1, 300 -m simulated course including three flat (1 °) DP sections interspersed with two uphill (7 °) DS sections. The modified GE method for estimating anaerobic energy production during skiing on varying terrain employed in Study IV revealed that the relative aerobic and anaerobic energy contributions were 82 % and 18 %, respectively, during the 232 s of skiing, with an accumulated oxygen (O 2) deficit of 45 mL/kg. The STT performance time was largely explained by the GE (53 %), followed by O 2 (30 %) and O 2 deficit (15 %). Therefore, training strategies designed to reduce energetic cost and improve GE should be examined in greater detail. In Study V metabolic responses and pacing strategies during the four successive STTs were investigated. The first and the last trials were the fastest (both 228 s) and were associated with both a substantially larger and a more rapid anaerobic energy supply, while the average O 2 during all four STTs was similar. The individual variation in STT performance was explained primarily (69 %) by the variation in O 2 deficit. Furthermore, positive pacing was employed throughout all the STTs, but the pacing strategy became more even after the first trial. In addition, considerably higher (~ 30 %) metabolic rates were generated on the uphill than on the flat sections of the course, reflecting an irregular production of anaerobic energy. Altogether, a fast start appears important for STT performance and high work rates during <b>uphill</b> <b>skiing</b> may exert a more pronounced impact on skiing performance outdoors, due to the reduction in velocity fluctuations and thereby overall air-drag.
