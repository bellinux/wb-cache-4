40|$|The rust pathogen, Puccinia psidii, {{was first}} {{detected}} in South Africa in 2013 {{on a single}} non-native ornamental Myrtus communis tree. This prompted surveys {{of the country to}} determine its geographic distribution and host range. Previously developed microsatellite markers where used to characterize the genetic diversity of P. psidii isolates collected from these surveys. In addition, artificial inoculation studies and field observations were used to evaluate the susceptibility of native Myrtaceae to infection by P. psidii. The pathogen was found on native Myrtaceae in isolated natural situations and it was also common on exotic Myrtaceae in nurseries and gardens. Marker analysis showed that a single genotype of the rust is present in South Africa and that this is different to the so-called Bpandemic^ strain recorded in countries outside Brazil. It was found to have a broad distribution in South Africa with collections as far as 1500 km apart. The data provide firm evidence for a single introduction of the pathogen from an as yet unkown source. Its wide distribution, particularly in relatively isolated natural areas, suggests that P. psidii has been present in South Africa for much longer than implied by its first detection in the country.

The Monthly Inquiry into the Distribution and Services Sector (MIDSS) is {{designed to meet the}} Government need for the production of a monthly Index of Services (IoS) and the Index of Distribution (IoD) which is a component of the IoS. Turnover data are collected monthly and, additionally, employment data are collected quarterly. It is used to estimate the change in turnover (and employment) in the service and distribution industries (excluding retail). MIDSS provides 40 % of the current turnover data used in the compilation of the IoS and 45 % of the data used to estimate the number of employees in the distribution and service industries. Both of these measures are key short-term economic indicators. The MIDSS also provides 30 % per cent of the output measure of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and feeds into the income measure of GDP along with other labour market data. There is no other official source of short-term economic data for distribution and service sectors with the comprehensive coverage of the MIDSS. MIDSS covers the following sectors: motor trades, wholesale, hotels and restaurants, transport and postal services (excluding national post activities), renting, computer and related services, research and development, business services (e. g. labour recruitment and accounting), sewage and refuse disposal, recreation, and other services.

Additional Scales on High Involvement Management, Family-Friendly Management and Lean Production from the Workplace Employee Relations Survey, 2004 investigates how the implementation of such employment approaches {{can be linked to}} employee well-being and organisational performance. High involvement management (HIM) involves such organisational practices as team-working, flexible job descriptions and other arrangements which encourage greater flexibility and collaboration along with acquiring the skills and knowledge required to optimise working in teams. Lean production entails practices which facilitate the timely and efficient procurement and delivery of goods and services. Family-friendly policies are aimed at helping employees by providing flexitime working and access to facilities which support the achievement of an optimal work-life balance. This study used data from Workplace Employee Relations Survey, 2004 (WERS 2004) (available from the UK Data Archive under SN 5294).

40|$|Objectives Caffeine {{represents}} a useful scaffold {{for the design}} of monoamine oxidase (MAO) type B inhibitors. Specifically, substitution on the C 8 position yields structures which are high-potency MAO-B inhibitors. To explore the structure–activity relationships of MAO-B inhibition by caffeine-derived compounds, this study examines the MAO inhibitory properties of a series of phenylalkylcaffeine analogues. Methods Employing the recombinant human enzymes, the potencies (IC 50 values) by which the caffeine analogues inhibit MAO-A and MAO-B were measured. The reversibility of inhibition of a selected inhibitor was determined by measuring the recovery of enzyme activity after dilution and dialysis of enzymeinhibitor mixtures. Key findings The results document that the phenylalkylcaffeine analogues are reversible and selective MAO-B inhibitors with a competitive mode of inhibition. The most potent analogue, 8 -(7 -phenylheptyl) caffeine, exhibits IC 50 values for the inhibition of MAO-A and MAO-B of 3. 01 μm and 0. 086 μm, respectively. Increasing the length of the alkyl side chain leads to enhanced MAO-A and MAO-B inhibitory potency while introduction of a carbonyl group reduces MAO-B inhibitory potency. Conclusions Phenylalkylcaffeines represent a new class of high-potency MAO-B inhibitors with the longer alkyl side chains yielding enhanced inhibitory activity. Such compounds may represent useful leads for the development of antiparkinsonian therapiesSupported in part by the Medical Research Council and National Research Foundation (NRF) of South Africa (Grant specific <b>unique</b> <b>reference</b> <b>numbers</b> (UID) 85642 and 80647) [URL]...|$|R
