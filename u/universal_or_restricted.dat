40|$|Aims: To compare, using a {{decision}} model, performance, treatment pathways {{and effects of}} different newborn screening strategies for developmental hip dysplasia with no screening. Methods: Detection rate, radiological absence of subluxation at skeletal maturity and avascular necrosis of the femoral head, as favourable and unfavourable treatment outcomes respectively, were compared for the following strategies: clinical screening alone using the Ortolani and Barlow tests; the addition of static and dynamic ultrasound examination of the hips of all infants (<b>universal</b> ultrasound) <b>or</b> <b>restricted</b> to infants with defined risk factors (selective ultrasound); “no screening” (that is, clinical diagnosis only). Results: <b>Universal</b> <b>or</b> selective ultrasound detects more more affected children (76 % and 60 % respectively) than clinical screening alone (35 %), results in {{a higher proportion of}} affected children with favourable treatment outcomes (92 % and 88 % respectively) than clinical screening alone (78 %) or no screening (75 %), and the highest proportion of these achieved without recourse to surgery (64 % and 79 % respectively) compared with clinical screening alone (18 %). However, ultrasound based strategies are also associated with the highest number of unfavourable treatment outcomes arising in unaffected children treated following a false positive screening result. The detection rate of clinical screening alone becomes similar to that reported for universal ultrasound when based on studies using experienced examiners (80 %) rather than junior medical staff (35 %). Conclusion: From the largely observational data available, ultrasound based screening strategies appear to be most sensitive and effective but are associated with the greatest risk of potential adverse iatrogenic effects arising in unaffected children.

40|$|Copyright © 2003 BMJ Publishing Group & Royal College of Paediatrics and Child HealthAims: To assess, using a {{decision}} model, {{the efficiency of}} ultrasound based and clinical screening strategies for developmental dysplasia of the hip. Methods: The additional cost per additional favourable outcome was compared for the following strategies: clinical screening alone using the Ortolani and Barlow tests; addition of static and dynamic ultrasound examination of the hips of all infants (<b>universal</b> ultrasound) <b>or</b> <b>restricted</b> to infants with defined risk factors (selective ultrasound); "no screening" (that is, clinical diagnosis only). Results: Ultrasound based screening strategies are predicted {{to be more effective}} but more costly than clinical screening or no screening. Estimated total costs per 100 000 live births are approximately £ 4 million for universal ultrasound, £ 3 million for selective ultrasound, £ 1 million for clinical screening alone, and £ 0. 4 million for no screening. The relative efficiency of selective ultrasound and clinical screening is poorly differentiated, and depends on how infants are selected for ultrasound as well as the expertise of clinical screening examiners. If training costs less than £ 20 per child screened, clinical screening alone would be more efficient than selective ultrasound. Relative to no screening, each of the 16 additional favourable outcomes achieved as a result of selective ultrasound costs approximately £ 0. 2 million, while each of the five favourable outcomes achieved through universal ultrasound screening, over and above selective ultrasound, costs approximately £ 0. 3 million. Conclusions: Policy choice depends on values attached to the different outcomes, willingness to pay to achieve these and total budget. J Brown, C Dezateux, J Karnon, A Parnaby and R Arthu...|$|R
