30|$|The {{adoption}} of the AD pathway provided true cost savings, as charges for room and board were decreased 33  % compared to those treated in the SD pathway, with a small decrease in therapy charges. These charges are less than those described in previous studies, although this variability {{may be related to}} both geographic and demographic differences [2, 25, 26]. While this savings is significant, it remains a much smaller component of the overall health care cost incurred by the patient or insurance provider in North America as the price of surgical implants continues to far surpass that of hospital stay or ancillary services [2]. The $ 900 saved in room charges in our system is but {{a small fraction of the}} total hospital charge in the United States; however, this savings may be much more substantial when imparted in other countries where implant costs are lower and the cost of hospital stay is higher. We were unable to truly compare the savings imparted by the AD pathway, as the variability in implants was significant. Nonetheless, the savings imparted by utilization of this pathway is likely comparable <b>to</b> <b>using</b> <b>one</b> <b>fewer</b> pedicle screw [27]. It should be noted, however, that when a savings of between 33 and 65  % is applied across multiple surgical procedures and over extended periods of time, financial impact could be quite significant as long as complications are not increased. Another system-based consideration is the potential cost savings associated with freeing up hospital beds to accommodate other patients and obviate the need to expand hospital facilities. When extrapolating the data for the two hospitals, the implementation of the AD pathway at the SD hospital could have resulted in 170 fewer hospital days for the 125 patients treated at that campus over 2  years.|$|R
