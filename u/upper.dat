40|$|To {{achieve the}} {{efficiency}} and specification of the flat-knitted <b>uppers</b> design, the basic patterns of <b>uppers</b> are made from shoe lasts based on the research {{on the characteristics of}} human’s feet and wearability requirements on <b>uppers.</b> The knitting technology for half-shaped and fully shaped <b>uppers</b> was formed after the shear deformation of basic pattern and combination with flat knitting technology. As regards to the functional requirements on key parts of <b>uppers,</b> the structures of flat-knitted shaped <b>uppers</b> were intensively analysed and studied, dividing them into two categories (functional structure and decorative structure), discussing the knitting methods and advantages of different structure, and finally experimentally proving that the planar pattern of flat knitted <b>uppers</b> can apply to the design of flat-knitted <b>uppers</b> and achieve the combination of functionality and artistry of sneakers after combining with structural changes, with a great significance on the achievement of the efficient production of <b>uppers</b> and the enhancement of its commercial value...|$|R

5|$|General Admirals {{armament}} {{was made}} and installed in Russia. Her battery deck carried thirty-six 60-pounder muzzle-loading guns and four long 36-pounder chase guns. The <b>upper</b> deck had twenty-four 60-pounder guns and two long 36-pounder chase guns. Two 3-pood shell guns were mounted fore and aft on revolving platforms. In 1862 her armament was revised and two 60-pounder and the two long 36-pounder guns on her <b>upper</b> deck were removed. Four years later, it was rearranged with two 60-pounders moved from her <b>upper</b> deck to the lower deck and two long 36-pounders moved from the lower deck to the <b>upper</b> deck.|$|E

5|$|Heterodontosaurus {{is known}} from fossils found in {{formations}} of the Karoo Supergroup, including the <b>Upper</b> Elliot Formation and the Clarens Formation, which {{date to the}} Hettangian and Sinemurian ages of the Lower Jurassic, around 200-190million years ago. Originally, Heterodontosaurus {{was thought to be}} from the <b>Upper</b> Triassic period. The <b>Upper</b> Elliot Formation consists of red/purple mudstone and red/white sandstone, whereas the slightly younger Clarens Formation consists of white/cream-coloured sandstone. The Clarens Formation is less rich in fossils than the <b>Upper</b> Elliot Formation; its sediments also often form cliffs, restricting accessibility for fossil hunters. The <b>Upper</b> Elliot Formation is characterised by animals that appear to be more lightly built than those of the Lower Elliot Formation, which may have been an adaptation to the drier climate at this time in southern Africa. Both formations are famous for their abundant vertebrate fossils, including temnospondyl amphibians, turtles, lepidosaurs, aetosaurs, crocodylomorphs, and non-mammal cynodonts.|$|E

5|$|In {{another example}} of {{evolution}} of culture, Durkheim pointed to fashion, although in this case he noted a more cyclical phenomenon. According to Durkheim, fashion serves to differentiate between lower classes and <b>upper</b> classes, but because lower classes {{want to look like}} the <b>upper</b> classes, they will eventually adapt the <b>upper</b> class fashion, depreciating it, and forcing the <b>upper</b> class to adopt a new fashion.|$|E

5|$|The large <b>upper</b> incisors are orthodont, {{with their}} cutting edge {{at about a}} right angle to the <b>upper</b> molars, and heavily {{pigmented}} with orange. Those of T.hylophilus are narrower, less procumbent, and less pigmented. The orthodont <b>upper</b> incisors suffice to distinguish T.ucucha from all {{other members of the}} genus but T.australis and T.daphne, which have much shorter and narrower incisors. The left and right molar rows are parallel. The molars are more hypsodont (high-crowned) than in other Thomasomys. The anterocone, the cusp {{at the front of the}} first <b>upper</b> molar, is divided into distinct cuspules at the lingual (inner) and labial (outer) sides by an anteromedian flexus. The accessory ridges on the <b>upper</b> molars, the anterolophs and mesolophs, are less well-developed than in T.hylophilus. The third <b>upper</b> molar is reduced relative to the second, much more so than in T.hylophilus. The lower molars are generally similar to the uppers, but the anteroconid (the equivalent of the anterocone on the first lower molar) is often undivided and the third molar is unreduced.|$|E

Water is either pumped from the lower to the <b>upper</b> reservoir to serve as stored energy or released from the <b>upper</b> to the lower reservoir to generate electricity. Pumping occurs during low demand, cheap electricity, periods such as night and generating will occur during peak demand, expensive electricity, hours such as during the day. The pumping/generating process repeats as needed.|$|E

5|$|The {{surface of}} the rhinarium {{does not have any}} {{olfactory}} receptors, so it is not used for smell in terms of detecting volatile substances. Instead, it has sensitive touch receptors (Merkel cells). The rhinarium, <b>upper</b> lip, and gums are tightly connected by a fold of mucous membrane called the philtrum, which runs from the tip of the nose to the mouth. The <b>upper</b> lip is constrained by this connection and has fewer nerves to control movement, which leaves it less mobile than the <b>upper</b> lips of simians. The philtrum creates a gap (diastema) between the roots of the first two <b>upper</b> incisors.|$|E
5|$|The <b>upper</b> esophageal {{sphincter}} {{surrounds the}} <b>upper</b> {{part of the}} esophagus. It consists of skeletal muscle but is not under voluntary control. Opening of the <b>upper</b> esophageal sphincter is triggered by the swallowing reflex. The primary muscle of the <b>upper</b> esophageal sphincter is the cricopharyngeal part of the inferior pharyngeal constrictor.|$|E
5|$|The <b>upper</b> molars {{have two}} {{longitudinal}} rows of cusps, not three {{as in the}} black and brown rats. The first and second <b>upper</b> molars are oval in form and the flexi do not extend to the midline of the molars. The anterocone, the front cusp of the <b>upper</b> first molar, is not divided in two by an indentation at its front (anteromedian flexus), but does display a hollow in the middle, the anteromedian fossette, which divides it into separate cuspules at the labial and lingual (inner) sides of the molar. A crest, the anteroloph, is present behind the labial cuspule, but in older animals, the cusps and the crest are united into a single structure by wear. In the third <b>upper</b> molar, the cusps at the back are reduced and scarcely distinguishable. As in most oryzomyines, the <b>upper</b> molars all have one root on the inner (lingual) side and two on the outer (labial) side; in addition, the first <b>upper</b> molar usually has another small labial root.|$|E
