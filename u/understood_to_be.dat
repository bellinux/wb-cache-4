5|$|Hoskuld died around 965, leaving Olaf a full mark of gold, causing {{tension between}} Olaf and Hoskuld's {{legitimate}} sons, Bard and Thorleik. As an illegitimate son, Olaf {{was entitled to}} one mark of his father's wealth; this was, however, customarily <b>understood</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a mark of silver and not gold. Olaf eased the tension by paying one-third of the communal funeral feast for Hoskuld.|$|E
5|$|In {{classical}} Pentecostalism, the baptism {{with the}} Holy Spirit is <b>understood</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a {{separate and distinct}} experience occurring sometime after regeneration. It is an empowering experience, equipping Spirit-filled believers for witness and ministry. Extending from this {{is the belief that}} all the spiritual gifts mentioned in the New Testament are to be sought and exercised to build up the church. Pentecostals believe that Spirit baptism will be accompanied by the physical evidence of speaking in tongues (glossolalia).|$|E

5|$|Kenyon {{taught that}} Christ's {{substitutionary}} atonement secured for believers {{a right to}} divine healing. This was attained through positive, faith-filled speech; the spoken word of God allowed believers to appropriate the same spiritual power that God used to create the world and attain the provisions promised in Christ's death and resurrection. Prayer was <b>understood</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a binding, legal act. Rather than asking, Kenyon taught believers to demand healing since they were already legally entitled to receive it.|$|E
5|$|Some B-class bracteates showing three godly {{figures have}} been {{interpreted}} as depicting Baldr's death, {{the best known}} of these is the Fakse bracteate. Two of the figures are <b>understood</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Baldr and Odin while both Loki and Hel have been proposed as candidates for the third figure. If it is Hel she is presumably greeting the dying Baldr as he comes to her realm.|$|E

5|$|While the {{religious}} hierarchy mirrored the Empire's administrative divisions, the clergy were more ubiquitous than the emperor's servants. The issue of caesaropapism, while {{usually associated with}} the Byzantine Empire, is now <b>understood</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an oversimplification of actual conditions in the Empire. By the fifth century, the Patriarch of Constantinople was recognized as first among equals of the four eastern Patriarchs and as of equal status with the Pope in Rome.|$|E
5|$|Because planetesimals are so numerous, {{and spread}} {{throughout}} the protoplanetary disk, some survive {{the formation of a}} planetary system. Asteroids are <b>understood</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> left-over planetesimals, gradually grinding each other down into smaller and smaller bits, while comets are typically planetesimals from the farther reaches of a planetary system. Meteorites are samples of planetesimals that reach a planetary surface, and provide {{a great deal of information}} about the formation of the Solar System. Primitive-type meteorites are chunks of shattered low-mass planetesimals, where no thermal differentiation took place, while processed-type meteorites are chunks from shattered massive planetesimals.|$|E
5|$|Driessen explores ways {{in which}} nonhuman animals might be <b>understood</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{engaging}} in political deliberation. His claim is empirical rather than normative, as he presents nonhuman animals as already being in political dialogue with humans; rather than arguing that rights should be extended to animals, he calls for a recognition of how interactions with animals have always been political. This is particularly noticeable, he argues, when humans {{are involved in the}} development of new technologies, analysing the example (following Bruno Latour) of Gaston Lagaffe building a door in dialogue with his boss and the office cat, and of farmers and cows using milking robots. He argues that a recognition of this animal deliberation can lead to more thoughtful forms of both environmentalism and democracy.|$|E

5|$|English astrology {{had reached}} its zenith by the 17th century. Astrologers were theorists, researchers, and social engineers, {{as well as}} {{providing}} individual advice to everyone from monarchs downwards. Among other things, astrologers could advise on the best time to take a journey or harvest a crop, diagnose and prescribe for physical or mental illnesses, and predict natural disasters. This underpinned a system in which everything—people, the world, the universe—was <b>understood</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> interconnected, and astrology co-existed happily with religion, magic and science.|$|E
5|$|Forest {{fires were}} viewed {{for many decades}} {{as a threat to}} {{protected}} areas such as forests and parks. As a better understanding of fire ecology developed after the 1960s, forest fires were <b>understood</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a natural part of the ecosystem. The earlier policies of suppression resulted in the accumulation of dead and decaying trees and plants, which would normally have been reduced had fires been allowed to burn. Many species of plants and animals actually need wildfires to help replenish the soil with nutrients and to open up areas that allow grasses and smaller plants to thrive.|$|E
5|$|Lava {{flows from}} Mauna Kea {{overlapped}} in complex layers {{with those of}} its neighbors during its growth. Most prominently, Mauna Kea is built upon older flows from Kohala to the northwest, and intersects the base of Mauna Loa to the south. The original eruptive fissures (rift zones) in the flanks of Mauna Kea were buried by its post-shield volcanism. Hilo Ridge, a prominent underwater rift zone structure east of Mauna Kea, was once {{believed to be a}} part of the volcano; however, it is now <b>understood</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a rift zone of Kohala that has been affected by younger Mauna Kea flows.|$|E

5|$|Many {{genes are}} known to be {{involved}} in schizophrenia, each of small effect and unknown transmission and expression. The summation of these effect sizes into a polygenic risk score can explain at least 7% of the variability in liability for schizophrenia. Around 5% of cases of schizophrenia are <b>understood</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> at least partially attributable to rare copy number variants (CNVs), including 22q11, 1q21 and 16p11. These rare CNVs increase the risk of an individual developing the disorder by as much as 20-fold, and are frequently comorbid with autism and intellectual disabilities. There is a genetic relation between the common variants which cause schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, an inverse genetic correlation with intelligence and no genetic correlation with immune disorders.|$|E
5|$|One {{source of}} {{inspiration}} for Tristan und Isolde was the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer, notably his The World as Will and Representation, to which Wagner had been introduced in 1854 by his poet friend Georg Herwegh. Wagner later called this the most important event of his life. His personal circumstances certainly made him an easy convert to what he <b>understood</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Schopenhauer's philosophy, a deeply pessimistic view of the human condition. He remained an adherent of Schopenhauer {{for the rest of}} his life.|$|E
5|$|Skyscraper Museum {{director}} Carol Willis, and art consultant Franck Mercurio, {{curator at}} the Field Museum in Chicago, offer moderating modern views {{about the influence of}} Saarinen's design. Willis notes that setback architecture was being implemented in New York City highrises because of 1916 zoning ordinances related to building height and sunlight, and that Saarinen's design was <b>understood</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an embodiment of this trend. Mercurio points to the Tribune Tower competition entry from American architect Bertram Goodhue as having the same modernist features as Saarinen's, with dramatic setbacks but a more pronounced simplification of the exterior. Mercurio argues that Goodhue's design is a better example of modernism because it has less ornamentation. Goodhue's entry gained him honorable mention but no cash award.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese convoy was {{a result}} of a Japanese Imperial General Headquarters {{decision}} in December 1942 to reinforce their position in the South West Pacific. A plan was devised to move some 6,900 troops from Rabaul directly to Lae. The plan was <b>understood</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> risky, because Allied air power in the area was strong, but it was decided to proceed because otherwise the troops would have to be landed a considerable distance away and march through inhospitable swamp, mountain and jungle terrain without roads before reaching their destination. On 28 February 1943, the convoy – comprising eight destroyers and eight troop transports with an escort of approximately 100 fighters – set out from Simpson Harbour in Rabaul.|$|E
5|$|The levels found {{today in}} {{most people are}} orders of {{magnitude}} greater than those of pre-industrial society.

During the end of the 20th century, the blood lead levels deemed acceptable steadily declined. Blood lead levels once considered safe are now considered hazardous, with no known safe threshold.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosperity}} theology {{teaching of}} positive confession stems from its proponents' view of scripture. The Bible {{is seen as}} a faith contract between God and believers; God is <b>understood</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> faithful and just, so believers must fulfill their end of the contract to receive God's promises. This leads to a belief in positive confession, the doctrine that believers may claim whatever they desire from God, simply by speaking it. Prosperity theology teaches that the Bible has promised prosperity for believers, so positive confession means that believers are speaking in faith what God has already spoken about them. Positive confession is practiced to bring about what is already believed in; faith itself is a confession, and speaking it brings it into reality.|$|E
