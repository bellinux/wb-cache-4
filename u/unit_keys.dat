40|$|Sunflower is a plant of the American continent, but {{now many}} wild spe-cies are spread in {{different}} part of the world. Along the coast of the Inhambane Bay, Mozambique, two sunflower species, H. argophyllus and H. debilis, both of Texas origin, grow far apart. However, in two sites on sandy soil they grow together and many plants have been recognized as hybrids, sharing morpho-logical traits typical of the two species. Some putative hybrid plants produced seed from which a new generation was raised at University of Udine. We present data coming from morphological and AFLP analyses of plants grown in the spring 2000. With morphological traits typical of the two species we have build up a classical hybrid index by adding the scores of each species. Clear evidence of introgressed plants results also by looking at the unequality of the AFLP bands present in H. debilis and H. argophyllus and shared in the introgressed material. A partial pollen grain staining confirms the presence of reduced fertility of some morphologically introgressed plants. From a breeding point of view, these wild species and the introgressed material seems to have great potential value for their specificity. The AFLP band pattern from H. annuus material appears to be quite unique and a cluster analysis shows a clear diversity of the three species. Deeper investigation is required in order to assess the extent of these data and to establish whether plants with intermedi-ate traits can represent a new taxonomic <b>unit.</b> <b>Keys</b> words: wild sunflower, introgression, AFLPs, hybrid inde...|$|E
