40|$|Next, {{we compare}} {{procedures}} for certain feature scenarios. In the IS- 41 approach, features are handled in three ways: by the HLR upon receiving a LOCREQ, a serving MSC upon receiving a ROUTEREQ, {{or by the}} serving MSC upon receiving a connection setup message. For example, <b>unconditional</b> <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> and selective call acceptance are features handled by the HLR upon receiving a LOCREQ, call forwarding on busy is handled by the serving MSC during ROUTEREQ, and call forwarding on no-answer or no response to page are triggered at the serving MSC during connection setup. For features handled by the serving MSCs, only service triggers are downloaded. Any data associated with the service is retained in the HLR. For example, call forwarding on no-answer is triggered at the serving MSC if the user does not answer after connection is setup. However, the forwarded number is stored in the HLR. Retrieval of this data requires messaging to the HLR. This approach is well-suited for some features that have large amounts of associated data. For example, speed dial may require the HLR to download {{a large amount of}} data if the mobile user has a large database of numbers. Such downloading and subsequent movements to new VLRs as the end point moves will generate a high signaling load. The cost of extra messaging during call/connection setup delay may be a small penalty in comparison to this increased signaling load. On the other hand, for features with small amounts of data, such as a forwarded number for call forwarding on no-answer, the increased call/connection setup delay associated with increased messaging may be more costly than the increased signaling load caused by downloading thi...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new algorithm, Hit-or-Jump, for embedded testing of components of communication systems {{that can be}} modeled by communicating extended finite state machines. It constructs test sequences efficiently with a high fault coverage. It does not have state space explosion, as is often encountered in exhaustive search, and it quickly covers the system components under test without being "trapped", as is experienced by random walks. Furthermore, it is a generalization and unification of both exhaustive search and random walks; both are special cases of Hit-or-Jump. The algorithm has been implemented and applied to embedded testing of telephone services in an IN architecture, including the Basic Call Service (BCS) and five supplementary services: Originating Call Screening (OCS), Terminal Call Screening (TCS), <b>Call</b> <b>Forward</b> <b>Unconditional</b> (CFU), <b>Call</b> <b>Forward</b> on Busy Line (CBL) and Automatic Call Back (ACB).

50|$|<b>Call</b> <b>forwarding,</b> or <b>call</b> diversion, is a {{telephony}} {{feature of}} some telephone switching systems which redirects {{a telephone call}} to another destination, which may be, for example, a mobile telephone, voicemail box or another telephone number where the desired called party is available. <b>Call</b> <b>forwarding</b> was invented by Ernest J. Bonanno. In North America, the forwarded line usually rings once to remind the customer using <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> that the <b>call</b> is being redirected. More consistently, the forwarded line indicates its condition by stutter dial tone. <b>Call</b> <b>forwarding</b> typically can redirect incoming calls to any other domestic telephone number, but {{the owner of the}} forwarded line must pay any toll charges for <b>forwarded</b> <b>calls.</b> <b>Call</b> <b>forwarding</b> is often enabled by dialing *72 followed by the telephone number to which <b>calls</b> should be <b>forwarded.</b> Once someone answers, <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> is in effect. If no one answers or the line is busy, the dialing sequence must be repeated to effect <b>call</b> <b>forwarding.</b> <b>Call</b> <b>forwarding</b> is disabled by dialing *73. This feature requires a subscription from the telephone company. Also available in some areas is Remote Access to <b>call</b> <b>forwarding,</b> which permit the control over <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> from telephones other than the subscriber's telephone. VOIP and cable telephone systems also often allow <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> to be set up and directed via their web portals.|$|R

50|$|These Android phones have a menu option “Dual SIM Always on” which when {{activated}} activates <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> on the carrier’s network. This {{can be done}} manually on any phone, {{regardless of}} manufacturer, e.g. enable <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> to SIM 1 when SIM 2 is disconnected. <b>Call</b> <b>Forwarding</b> must be provided by the carrier, often for a fee, subscriber will also be charged for <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> on a minute by minute basis, this depends on the subscription agreement.|$|R
40|$|In today’s {{world of}} {{telecommunications}} {{there is an}} increasing problem with reaching people one wishes to speak to. People have several telephones and this makes the situation complex for the caller. Many phone calls are left unanswered. The <b>Call</b> <b>Forwarding</b> Agent is in this report presented {{as a solution to}} this reachability problem. The idea is to have an agent setting <b>call</b> <b>forwards</b> of all the users’ phones or numbers, towards the terminal where he is available. Later, when someone calls any of the users’ phones, the call will be terminated at the terminal where the user can receive it. The <b>Call</b> <b>Forwarding</b> Agent is compared to a number of similar services. The personal number service offers the same functionality as the <b>Call</b> <b>Forwarding</b> Agent, but the <b>Call</b> <b>Forwarding</b> Agent does not force the subscriber to change phone number and it also admits a simple call screening. We have implemented a prototype of the <b>Call</b> <b>Forwarding</b> Agent that can set <b>call</b> <b>forwards</b> of regular Public Service Telephony Network terminals and the Internet telephones in Ellemtel’s IP-phone system...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} {{the influence of a}} <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> service on the traffic process in modern telecommunication networks. We analyse in detail only the case when the called user is busy. It is proved that <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> not only increases utilization of servers and the percent of successful calls but it also increases the call loss. On the simple example, we showed that this call loss increase is greater in the case of local (internal) and incoming calls, but smaller in the case of outgoing calls. The reason for such behaviour is in the role of <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> function in the case of internal and incoming traffic. In that situation <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> function decreases the effect of limited number of users on the decrease of offered traffic, comparing to the case of internal and incoming traffic without <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> (Engset traffic model). This statement is illustrated by comparative graphics of traffic loss without <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> function, and with this function when considering, separately, internal, incoming, and outgoing traffic.

50|$|Some {{businesses}} {{find that}} the human touch can improve contact, thus sales, but traditional wired answering services are expensive, so they have their <b>calls</b> <b>forwarded</b> to a <b>call</b> center, so the client can reach an operator instead of an answering machine or voice mail. Before the availability of <b>call</b> <b>forwarding,</b> commercial answering services needed to physically connect to every line for which they provided after-hours response; this required their offices be located near the local central exchange and be fed by a huge multi-pair trunk in which a separate pair of wires existed for each client subscriber. With <b>call</b> <b>forwarding,</b> there is no physical connection to the client's main telephone service, which is merely call-forwarded to the answering service (usually on a direct inward dial number) {{at the end of}} the business day.|$|R
