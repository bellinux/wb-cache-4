30|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to find out whether the {{emerging}} processes in GPT grounded model validated the components of strategic competence proposed by Bachman and Palmer (1996). Bachman and Palmer (1996) discussed strategic competence as a set of metacognitive strategies including three main components: goal setting, assessment, and planning. On the other hand, Phakiti (2008 a) stated that both strategic knowledge (knowledge about what, how and when to apply a set of strategies) and strategic regulation (online realization and regulation of cognitive processing) form the theory of strategic competence. Likewise, Purpura (1999) explored that strategic competence presented by (Bachman and Palmer 1996) must be expanded beyond a set of metacognitive strategies because students utilize cognitive, affective and social strategies, along with metacognitive strategies when they apply the target language. In line with (Phakiti 2008 a; Purpura 1999), the grounded model of this study presented that cognitive strategies, metacognitive strategies constituted the strategic competence theory in light of graph-writing. For instance, the students invoked a set of cognitive strategies including <b>underlining</b> <b>key</b> words enabling participants to create structure for their composition and notice key elements to take notes. Another cognitive strategy is translation of both graphic and non-graphic information into written discourse in English paving the way for them to classify identified elements based on different perspectives, make a comparison between the identified elements in the graph and instruction, or recognize a pattern at the beginning of the main writing. Moreover, this strategy also gave them the means to cluster the information based on arithmetic information (e.g., percentage) and compute the difference between the quantitative relations to find a relation among bars. As they moved on identifying more features in the graph, they changed their classifications and take notes more specifically in order to refine the categories and explore the pattern underlying the classifications.|$|E

Residents accuse the county department of public works of purposeful contamination and discrimination over a period of 30 years. I raise the questions of how risk is perceived and what roles race or class may play. I also developed a model for risk communication that includes all stakeholders. Finally, I expand the conversation of health disparities to include issues of widening gaps in perceptions of health. This was examined by looking at the following: 1. The lack of documentation into the subjectivity of the health risk assessment process - i. e. the critique of science 2. The differing modes for creating, communicating, and receiving risk in which the resident 2 ̆ 7 s perspective is not valued - i. e. the critique of power 3.

The residents of Mitchell Heights (emic) perceive the contamination at the former Hernando County Department of Public Works site differently than the experts/officials (etic). 2. Race and class are factors in both the perception of risk and the communication of risk for the residents and the experts. 3.

40|$|AbstractInformation Technology (IT) {{systems have}} become an {{important}} competitive element across {{the great majority of}} industries, and technology projects are entrenched within all domains becoming larger and encompassing cross functional components. This increased technological dependency and transformation also increases the risk to organizations as a whole if something goes wrong. Pragmatically things often do go wrong and despite the evolution and sophistication of project management frameworks and methodologies a great percentage of IT projects are still failing. Although multiple actions have attempted to address this costly and prevailing trend, they have yet to positively and/or consistently impact it, even though it has caused additional management burdens and costly compliance requirements along the way. As the projections for IT investment increase by a magnitude of 3. 5 % (annual average) and IT project failures report losses in the billions (Gartner, 2011), this trend has become ever steeper over time. It is likely that the rates are even higher than the industry reports because individuals and organizations fear back lash when identifying and communicating perceived failures. The alarming (and increasing) rates of IT Project Failure 4 are strong indicators that this systemic trend has not yet been addressed from a causal perspective. The authors hence conducted extensive research in order to enable the assessment of this pervasive and costly issue through a unique approach and leveraged the social “lens” (one of the three fundamental research methodology pillars). Hypothesizing that the <b>underlining</b> <b>key</b> factors associated with this costly and pervasive trend could be traced to “soft factors” an extensive (multi-method) research effort based on three fundamental pillars (Grounded Theory, System Dynamics an Social Theory) has been conducted and has unveiled a new theoretical model promising greater understanding of IT (and potentially other) programs and projects. The IT project construct is looked upon by the researchers as “mini organizations” characterized by multiple changes and natural disruptions to the Social Order over time. The philosophical research framework was then operationalized by means of a four phased multi-method approach promoting a root cause identification of key factors driving IT project success and/or failures as well as their interdependencies and impacts. This paper presents the outcomes of this research (emerging theory), its key challenges and how they were overcome and discusses the Adaptive and Preemptive IT Theory (“AdaPIT”). In essence the “AdaPIT” Theory does not replace any existing IT project Management framework: it simply incorporates the identified Intangible Soft Factor (“ISF's”) into the applicable project construct. The main theory unveiled has been modeled and presented through multiple views that will be discussed in this paper. A summary analysis of the research findings will also be provided. It encompasses the author's representation from all data points collected throughout this investigation inclusive of their own experiences (“all is data”) as well as the review and feedback from industry practitioners, Grounded Theory subject matter experts and other technical and/or managerial personnel.

40|$|ABSTRACTHeat Transfer in Pebble-Bed Nuclear Reactor Cores Cooled by Fluoride SaltsByLakshana Ravindranath HuddarDoctor of Philosophy in Engineering – Nuclear EngineeringUniversity of California, BerkeleyProfessor Per F. Peterson, ChairWith {{electricity}} demand predicted to rise {{by more than}} 50 % within the next 20 years and a burgeoning world population requiring reliable emissions-free base-load electricity, can we design advanced nuclear reactors to help meet this challenge? At the University of California, Berkeley (UCB) Fluoride-salt-cooled High Temperature Reactors (FHR) are currently being investigated. FHRs are designed with better safety and economic characteristics than conventional light water reactors (LWR) currently in operation. These reactors operate at high temperature and low pressure making them more efficient and safer than LWRs. The pebble-bed FHR (PB-FHR) variant includes an annular nuclear reactor core that is filled with randomly packed pebble fuel. It is crucial to characterize the heat transfer within this unique geometry as this informs the safety limits of the reactor. The work presented in this dissertation focused on furthering the understanding of heat transfer in pebble-bed nuclear reactor cores using fluoride salts as a coolant. This was done through experimental, analytical and computational techniques. A complex nuclear system with a coolant that has never previously been in commercial use requires experimental data that can directly inform aspects of its design. It is important to isolate heat transfer phenomena {{in order to understand}} the underlying physics in the context of the PB-FHR, as well as to make decisions about further experimental work that needs to be done in support of developing the PB-FHR. Certain organic oils can simulate the heat transfer behaviour of the fluoride salt if relevant non-dimensional parameters are matched. The advantage of this method is that experiments can be done at a much lower temperature and at a smaller geometric scale compared to FHRs, thereby lowering costs. In this dissertation, experiments were designed and performed to collect data demonstrating similitude. The limitations of these experiments were also elucidated by <b>underlining</b> <b>key</b> distortions between the experimental and the prototypical conditions. This dissertation is broadly split into four parts. Firstly, the heat transfer phenomenology in the PB-FHR core was outlined. Although the viscous dissipation term and the thermal diffusion term (including thermal dispersion) were similar in magnitude, they were overshadowed by the advection term which was about 104 times bigger during normal operation and 105 times bigger during accident transients in which natural circulation becomes the main mode of fluid flow. Thus it is safe to neglect the viscous dissipation and the thermal diffusion terms in the PB-FHR core without a significant loss of accuracy. Secondly, separate effects tests (SET) were performed using simulant oils, and the results were compared to the prototypical conditions using flinak as the fluoride salt. The main purpose of these experiments was to study natural convection heat transfer and identify any distortions between the two cases. An isolated copper sphere was immersed in flinak and a parallel experiment was performed using simulant oil. A large discrepancy between the flinak and the oil was noted, due to distortions from assuming quasi-steady state conditions. A steady state experiment using a cylindrical heater immersed in oil was also performed, and the results compared to a similar experiment done at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) using flinak. The Nusselt numbers matched within 10 % for laminar flows. This supports the conclusion that natural convection similitude does exist for oils used in scaled experiments, allowing natural convection data to be used for for FHR and MSR modeling. This is important, due to the lack of significant experimental data showing natural convection in fluoride salts, so these SETs add to the overall understanding of their heat transfer properties. With the knowledge of the distortions between the oil and the salt, an experiment to measure heat transfer coefficients within a pebble-bed test section was designed, constructed and performed. Oil was pumped through a test section filled with randomly packed copper spheres. The temperature of the oil was pulsed at a constant frequency, which caused a temperature difference between the pebbles and the oil. An excellent match was found between the measured heat transfer coefficients and the literature. This data provides an essential closure parameter for multiphysics modeling of the PB-FHR. Using frequency response techniques in scaled experiments is an innovative approach for extracting dynamic responses to coolant-structure interactions. Finally, an integrated model of the passive decay heat removal system was presented using Flownex and the simulations compared to experimental data. A good match was found with the data, which was within 14 %. The work presented in this dissertation shows fundamental details on heat transfer in the PB-FHR core using experimental data and simulations, leading us closer to developing advanced nuclear reactors that can later be commercialized. Advanced nuclear reactors such as the PB-FHR have immense potential in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change while being exceedingly safe and providing reliable electricity...|$|E
