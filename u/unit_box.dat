Neighborhood Delivery Collection <b>Box</b> <b>Units</b> (NDCBUs) were the predecessor to today’s cluster <b>box</b> <b>units.</b> They had multiple compartments for the centralized delivery of mail {{to the residents}} of a building or an entire neighborhood, instead of door-to-door or curbside delivery.

50|$|Time <b>Unit</b> <b>Box</b> System (TUBS) is {{a simple}} system for notating events that happen over a period. This system is mostly used for notating rhythms in music. The {{notation}} consists {{of one or more}} rows of boxes; each box represents a fixed unit of time. Blank boxes indicate that nothing happens during that interval, while a mark in a box indicates that an event occurs at the start of that time interval.|$|E
5000|$|Consider the {{structure}} R = (R,+,&minus;,·,<,0,1), the ordered field of real numbers. In the 1960s Andrei Gabrielov proved that {{the structure}} obtained by starting with R and adding a function symbol for every analytic function restricted to the <b>unit</b> <b>box</b> 0,1m is model complete. [...] That is, any set definable in this structure Ran was just the projection of some higher-dimensional set defined by identities and inequalities involving these restricted analytic functions.|$|E
50|$|Below is {{an example}} of an adapted TUBS score {{depicting}} a percussion pattern for multiple instruments. One benefit with the TUBS system is that it clearly relates WHICH drum is to be struck (as the symbol will be solid, hollow, etc. uniquely for each drum) as opposed to different drums being notated via a different line of the musical staff, which can be more difficult to see. More importantly, the symbol used inside of each Time <b>Unit</b> <b>Box</b> relates how the drum is to be struck (open tone, slap, bass, rim-shot, etc.) which is not as easily conveyed with the musical staff notation.|$|E

The {{number of boxes}} is always within a factor of 3 d of the best possible static covering.

40|$|We discuss {{rectangle}} and box visibility {{representations of}} graphs in 3 -dimensional space. In these representations, vertices {{are represented by}} axis-aligned disjoint rectangles or boxes. Two vertices are adjacent {{if and only if}} their corresponding boxes see each other along a small axis-parallel cylinder. We concentrate on lower and upper bounds for the size of the largest complete graph that can be represented. In particular, we examine these bounds under certain restrictions: What can be said if we may only use boxes of a limited number of shapes. Some of the results presented are as follows: - There is a representation of K_ 8 by <b>unit</b> <b>boxes.</b> - There is no representation of K_ 1 _ 0 by <b>unit</b> <b>boxes.</b> - There is a representation of K_ 5 _ 6, using 6 different box shapes. - There is no representation of K_ 1 _ 8 _ 4 by general boxes. A special case arises for rectangle visibility graphs, where no two boxes can see each other in the x- or y-directions, which means that the boxes have to see each other in z-parallel direction. This special case has been considered before; we give further results, dealing with the aspects arising from limits on the number of shapes. (orig.)

50|$|The {{following}} {{is an example of}} a 3 against 2 polyrhythm, given in time <b>unit</b> <b>box</b> system (TUBS) notation; each box represents a fixed unit of time; time progresses from the left of the diagram to the right. It is in bad form to teach a student to play 3:2 polyrhythms as simply quarter note, eighth note, eighth note, quarter note. The proper way is to establish sound bases for both the quarter-notes, and the triplet-quarters, and then to layer them upon each other, forming multiple rhythms. Beats are indicated with an X; rests are indicated with a blank.|$|E
50|$|A {{gyroscope}} was attached, via mechanical linkage, to {{an optical}} monocular sight {{to form the}} gyro rate unit or GRU. Gyroscopes, when spinning, keep their spin axes pointed in a given direction if they are undisturbed. As the cross-hairs of the optical sight are kept centred on the moving aircraft the mechanical linkage will pull the gyroscope {{in the direction of}} the aircraft movement. The force required to move the gyroscope is proportional to the observed target movement across the line of sight. This force was measured by the deflection of a spring-loaded device and the deflection measurement was combined with rangefinder, and/or, radar measured target range and altitude in a specialized computer, the gyro rate <b>unit</b> <b>box</b> (GRUB).|$|E
50|$|The RN {{moved quickly}} to add true {{tachometric}} target motion prediction and radar ranging to the HACS by mid 1941. The RN was the first navy to adopt dedicated FC AA radars. However the system, in common with all WW2 era mechanical AA fire control system still had severe limitations as even the highly advanced USN Mk 37 system in 1944 needed an average of 1,000 rounds of 5-inch ammunition fired per kill. In 1940 the Gyro Rate Unit (GRU) {{was added to the}} HACS system, an analogue computer capable of directly calculating target speed and direction, converting the HACS into a tachymetric system. Also in 1940, radar ranging was added to the HACS. The GRU and its associated computer, the Gyro Rate <b>Unit</b> <b>Box</b> (GRUB) no longer assumed straight and level flying {{on the part of the}} target. GRU/GRUB could generate target speed and position data at angular rates of up to 6 degrees per second, which was sufficient to track a 360 knot crossing target at a range of 2000 yards.|$|E

They come across a group of Allied stragglers at a destroyed first aid station. The stragglers, led by British doctor Captain Halliday (Jerome Ehlers), decide to ride with Gunn in an attempt to escape the advancing Afrika Korps. Along the way, they pick up first British Sudanese soldier Tambul (Robert Wisdom) and his Italian prisoner, Giuseppe (Angelo D'Angelo), then downed Luftwaffe pilot lieutenant von Schletow (Julian Garner). The group ends up at a deserted Saharan oasis in search of water. With the Germans right behind them, they decide to stay and defend the well, holding up a battalion of 500 Germans.|$|R
50|$|The gyro rate <b>unit</b> <b>box</b> {{used the}} {{measured}} target motion, range and height, to accurately determine the true {{direction of movement}} of the target, including its rate of altitude change, and passed this information to the HACS computer, which then generated the gun laying orders and the correct time fuze setting. The HACS computer could not directly use rate of altitude change information, so the GRUB would calculate the target altitude, direction and apparent speed for a short interval of time, equal to the loading cycle of the guns, {{in advance of the}} actual time and feed this to the HACS computer allowing it to generate correct gunlaying and fuze setting orders. The GRUB thus converted the HACS into a tachymetric fire control system. The GRU and the GRUB began to appear on RN ships in 1940. The GRU/GRUB could calculate target speed and direction for targets with a maximum speed of 360 knots, or 6 degrees of target motion per second and was most accurate at shorter ranges where apparent target motion was highest. GRU/GRUB was also used on The Pom-Pom Director, Mark IV, and with the Fuze Keeping Clock.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In popular {{symmetric}} ciphers, S-box substitution is {{the core}} operation that dominates executions of cryptographic algorithms. In this paper, a method of application-specific instruction-set extension is used for accelerating the key operation in symmetric cryptography. Two instructions for S-box access are designed by constructing a novel flexible on-chip parallel substitution <b>box</b> <b>unit</b> that consists of multiple lookup tables and a post-processing module. The <b>box</b> <b>unit</b> is integrated into the 32 -bit configurable Leon 2 processor. Configuration of Leon 2 is presented. Implementing this extended processor core on Virtex-II XC 2 V 3000 FPGA shows that the parallel substitution <b>box</b> <b>unit</b> uses very small amount of hardware resources (1 KB of memory and some logic circuits). Evaluation {{of the performance of}} S-box access instructions for AES is conducted according to Amdahl Law, and the results show that overall speedup of greater than 2 can be achieved. Benefits for other symmetric ciphers using S-box substitution as their core operation are accordingly expected...|$|R
