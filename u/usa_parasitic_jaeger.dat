5000|$|Identification is {{complicated}} by similarities to long-tailed jaeger and pomarine jaeger, {{and the existence of}} three colour morphs. Small for a skua, the <b>parasitic</b> <b>jaeger</b> measures 41 - 48 cm in length, 107 - 125 cm in wingspan and weighs 300 - 650 g.

40|$|Indexación: Web of Science; Scielo. BACKGROUND: Skuas and jaegers (Charadriiformes: Stercorariidae) are seabirds {{breeding}} at {{moderate to}} high latitudes and some perform extensive post-breeding transequatorial migrations. Most species overwinter and perform significant {{portions of their}} migratory flyways along the Pacific coast of South America, but scant information is available on their at-sea ecology in this waters. Our aims {{in this study were}} to determine: 1) the timing of occurrence and fluctuations in abundance of skua and jaeger species, 2) their spatial distribution within the coastal zone and 3) at-sea behavior of birds, including flock size and interactions with other seabird species. RESULTS: Between July 2006 and October 2013, we conducted at-sea bird counts at Valparaiso Bay (33 °S) in central Chile and confirmed the occurrence of Chilean skuas (Stercorarius chilensis), Brown skuas (S. antarcticus), and <b>Parasitic</b> <b>jaegers</b> (S. parasiticus). <b>Parasitic</b> <b>jaegers</b> are regular austral summer visitors (November to March), whereas Brown skuas occur in the area only in winter (July to October). Chilean skuas were regularly recorded year-round in the area with higher abundances between late winter and early spring (August to October). Brown and Chilean skuas where observed comparatively offshore, whereas Jaegers presented a more coastal distribution, probably associated to host presence. Chilean skuas kleptoparasitized similar-sized (shearwaters and fulmars) and larger seabird species (boobies), whereas jaegers chased only smaller coastal birds (gulls and terns). Brown skuas engaged in no kleptoparasitic behaviors. All three species were observed mostly as solitary individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Skuas and jaegers showed in general a marked seasonality in their occurrence and abundance (only Chilean skua occurs year-round) and use this area as a commuting and stopover zone within their extensive migratory flyway along the southeastern Pacific.

5000|$|Its {{relationships}} {{are not fully}} resolved; its mitochondrial DNA is most similar to the great skua, but from morphology and behavior, it {{is closer to the}} lesser skuas (such as the <b>parasitic</b> <b>jaeger).</b> The most likely explanation is extensive hybridization between the great and one species of lesser skuas, which resulted in a hybrid population that eventually evolved into a distinct species, the pomarine jaeger; or alternatively between the pomarine and a species of Southern Hemisphere skua, with the great skua being the hybrid offspring, perhaps appearing as recently as the 15th century. Judging from characteristics of the skeleton and behavior, the former seems more likely, as the pomarine jaeger shares several similarities with the [...] "Catharacta" [...] skuas, while the great skua does not seem much different from its Southern Hemisphere relatives.|$|R
40|$|The {{maintenance}} of plumage color polymorphism in the <b>parasitic</b> <b>jaeger</b> (Stercorarius parasiticus) {{is still not}} well understood. Earlier studies indicated that selection may favor pale females and melanic males. If so, females would maximize their fitness, producing pale female and melanic male offspring. We therefore predicted that females might bias their offspring sex ratio toward daughters in pale pairs and toward sons in melanic pairs. Females might also choose to mate assortatively in relation to plumage color, thereby maximizing the probability of producing either pale or melanic offspring. Because females are larger than males, differential rearing costs may affect the offspring sex ratio independent of parental plumage color. We examined offspring sex ratio allocation, breeding variables indicative of parental quality, and mating pattern in relation to plumage color in a colony of <b>parasitic</b> <b>jaegers</b> in northern Norway. Jaegers tended to mate assortatively in relation to plumage color. The reproductive performance declined with season, and matched pairs appeared to be of lower quality than mixed pairs. The proportion of male offspring increased with hatching date in matched pale and mixed pairs, whereas the situation was reversed in matched melanic pairs. Matched pale pairs produced an overall surplus of favorable pale but costly daughters despite their lower quality, while melanic pairs produced a surplus of favorable melanic sons. However, differential offspring rearing costs and parental rearing capacity may have additionally affected the realized offspring sex ratio. Mixed pairs producing an overall surplus of pale and melanic daughters allocated their resources according to differential rearing costs and parental quality only. We suggest that both strategies of sex ratio allocation together with differences in reproductive success in matched versus mixed pairs may have a balancing effect on the mating pattern between plumage morphs and {{may contribute to the}} {{maintenance of}} the color polymorphism in this species.

40|$|On 5 October, 1997, {{we joined}} Joel G. Jorgensen and John Sullivan for a pelagic trip on Lake McConaughy. A similar trip in late September 1996 yielded a Sabine 2 ̆ 7 s Gull, {{but we were}} really hoping to see a jaeger. From 7 : 00 to 8 : 30 a. m. we {{gradually}} worked our way from the dam towards {{the western end of}} the lake. Besides moderate numbers of Franklin 2 ̆ 7 s and Ring-billed Gulls, there were few birds on the lake. At approximately 8 : 45 a. m. Dinsmore noticed that all of the gulls at the western end of the lake had suddenly taken flight. Less than a minute later, we simultaneously spotted a jaeger soaring directly overhead. The size, dark coloration, and prominent white flashes in the Wings identified the bird as a jaeger. The bird made a couple of attacks on Franklin Gulls and then flew east down the lake. We chased the jaeger for more than ten miles before losing it. We relocated the bird a short time later just above the dam. This time, the bird attacked a couple of Ring-billed Gulls before flying west up the lake. We again took chase, but lost the bird before reaching Lemoyne. The gull-like shape, generally brown coloration, and prominent white bases to the primaries identified the bird as a jaeger. The bird was smaller but longer-winged than a Ring-billed Gull and larger and slimmer than a Franklin 2 ̆ 7 s Gull. The overall coloration was dark brown, except for some warmer rufous tones on the underparts. We saw no visible barring on the underparts. The bill was straight and slender, but the color pattern was not noted. The upperwing was dark brown except for white at the base of at least the outermost four primaries. The underwing was also dark except for a prominent white area on the undersides of the bases of the primaries. The rectrices were dark and the central feathers were slightly elongated with pointed tips. We all agreed on the identification as a juvenile <b>Parasitic</b> <b>Jaeger.</b> Careful size comparisons to Franklin and Ring-billed Gulls eliminated juvenile Pomarine Jaeger, which also generally shows more white color on both surfaces of the wing. Juvenile Long-tailed Jaeger was eliminated {{on the basis of the}} pattern of white on the wing and size and wing proportions. We further concluded the bird was an intermediate or dark morph individual based on the dark plumage and lack of a contrasting paler head or rump. This represents the second accepted record of a <b>Parasitic</b> <b>Jaeger</b> for Nebraska. The only other record is of a juvenile picked up alive in Sheridan County on 23 Aug 1968 which died the next day (specimen number UNSM ZM 12309) (Gates, Doris. 1969. <b>Parasitic</b> <b>Jaeger</b> rather than Skua.

25|$|The {{island has}} been {{designated}} as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because of its importance as {{a breeding ground for}} seabirds. In 1978–79 there were an estimated 117,000 breeding penguins on the island, consisting of macaroni penguin and, to a lesser extent, chinstrap penguin and Adélie penguin, although these were only estimated to be 62,000 in 1989–90. Nyrøysa is the most important colony for penguins, supplemented by Posadowskybreen, Kapp Circoncision, Norvegiaodden and across from Larsøya.

50|$|Healthy adult {{birds have}} few natural predators. Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) may {{threaten}} breeding females and particular {{the eggs and}} hatchlings. Adults typically can stand their ground and displace foxes but occasionally the foxes are successful. Another surprisingly serious nest predator for tundra swans are brown bears (Ursus arctos), which were apparently {{the primary cause of}} nesting failure in both the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and Izembek National Wildlife Refuge. Other potential nest predators include red fox (Vulpes vulpes), golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos), <b>parasitic</b> <b>jaegers</b> (Stercorarius parasiticus), and glaucous gull (Larus hyperboreus). Brown bear, golden eagles and, rarely, gray wolves (Canis lupus) may on occasion succeed at capturing and killing an adult. Small or avian predators usually elicit either an aggressive response or the behavior of sitting tight on nests while larger mammals, perhaps more dangerous to adults, usually elicit the response of leading the cygnets into deep waters and standing still until they pass. About 15% of the adults die each year from various causes, and thus the average lifespan in the wild is about 10 years. The oldest recorded tundra swan was over 24 years old.|$|R
50|$|Great skuas measure 50 - 58 cm {{long and}} have a 125 - 140 cm wingspan. One study found that 112 males weighed an average of 1.27 kg and that 125 females weighed an average of 1.41 kg. Adults are a {{streaked}} greyish brown, with a black cap, while juveniles are a warmer brown and unstreaked below. They have a short, blunt tail, and a powerful flight. The great skua's call is a harsh hah-hah-hah-hah; quacking and croaking noises have also been heard. Distinguishing this skua from the other North Atlantic skuas (<b>parasitic</b> <b>jaeger,</b> pomarine jaeger and long-tailed jaeger) is relatively straightforward. The herring gull size, massive barrel chest and white wing flashes of this bird are distinctive even at a distance. It is sometimes said {{to give the impression}} of a common buzzard. Identification of this skua is only complicated when it is necessary to distinguish it from the closely related large southern-hemisphere skuas. Despite its name, the great skua is marginally smaller on average than the other 3 large southern-hemisphere skuas, although not by enough to distinguish them by size in the field. Some authorities still regard the great skua as conspecific with some of these southern skuas, and as a group they have sometimes been separated in the genus Catharacta, although currently this taxonomy is not commonly followed.|$|R
40|$|Seabirds feed {{heavily on}} Arctic cod Boreogadus saida {{during the summer}} in the Canadian Arctic but little is known of the {{interactions}} among birds while foraging and the factors that drive feeding behaviour. The objective {{of this study was}} to describe the relationship between seabirds and Arctic cod in a productive feeding area distant from breeding colonies. Transect surveys were completed using standardized count protocols to determine the density of seabirds in Allen Bay, Cornwallis Island, Nunavut. Shore-based observation sites determined seabird foraging behaviour associated with the presence of schools and environmental variables. The density of birds (156 bird/km** 2) was high compared to that of other locations in the Canadian Arctic. Several bird species were more active early in the morning and with winds from the south, possibly due to an increase in Arctic cod feeding on zooplankton at the surface. Northern fulmars Fulmarus glacialis and black-legged kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla captured Arctic cod directly from the water; however, they lost nearly 25 % of captures to glaucous gulls Larus hyperboreus and <b>parasitic</b> <b>jaegers</b> Stercorarius parasiticus. These kleptoparasitic seabirds benefited the most in Allen Bay obtaining as much as 8 times more Arctic cod than species capturing cod directly. Northern fulmars captured 3 times more Arctic cod from schools, and black-legged kittiwakes captured similar proportions of schooling and non-schooling cod. We conclude that non-schooling Arctic cod are as important as schooling cod as an energy source for seabirds in nearshore areas, such as Allen Bay, during the summer...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. We used {{video cameras}} to {{identify}} nest predators at active shorebird and passerine nests and conducted point count surveys separately to determine species richness and detection frequency of potential nest predators in the Prudhoe Bay region of Alaska. From the surveys, we identified 16 potential nest predators, with glaucous gulls (Larus hyperboreus) and <b>parasitic</b> <b>jaegers</b> (Stercorarius parasiticus) making {{up more than}} 80 % of the observations. From the video evidence, however, we identified arctic foxes (Alopex lagopus) as the predators in five of six predation events recorded with the cameras. These results indicate that estimated abundances of predators alone may not accurately reflect their true or proportional importance as nest predators. We {{also found that the}} identified predators removed all eggs and left the nests intact. Thus, attempts to identify predators {{solely on the basis of}} nest remains are not reliable for smaller bird species in this region. We found no evidence that camera-monitored nests were at greater risk of predation or desertion than camera-free nests. Overall, our ability to film predation events was hampered by the brief, highly synchronized breeding season, the harsh climate, and the higher nest survivorship for shorebirds in this region relative to temperate-breeding passerines, which have been the focus of most studies that use camera systems in attempts to identify nest predators at active nests.

Increased nest density {{had no effect on}} nest survival, egg survival, or likelihood of partial clutch predation in snow geese. In brant, nest survival declined as nest density increased in 1992 and with increased distance from shore in 1993. Brant with conspecific nearest neighbours were less likely to suffer partial clutch predation in 1993, but not in 1992. Egg survival in brant increased with nest density in 1993, but decreased as density increased in 1992, however, the decrease occurred only in nests with three or four eggs. Nesting at high densities, in central positions, or far from shorelines commonly travelled by glaucous gulls Larurs hyperboreus and <b>parasitic</b> <b>jaegers</b> Stercorarius parasiticus, the primary egg predators in this study, did not provide geese with a nest or egg survival advantage because effects were lacking in snow geese and were inconsistent and contradictory in brant. Female snow geese had very high nest attendance and both sexes had high territory attendance so snow goose nests were rarely unattended during incubation. Brant had lower nest attendance than snow geese, and due to a lack food near their nests, brant left their territories to feed resulting in lower territory attendance as well. Although male brant were capable of defending the nest from avian predators and usually remained on their territories when females were absent, males were less effective defenders than incubating females. Increased vigilance and decreased resting by female brant as incubation progressed provided support for the prediction, from parental investment theory, that nest guarding effort would increase with offspring age, but there were no changes in male brant or in snow geese. However, declining nest and territory attendance by female brant and males of both species contradicted predictions from parental investment theory but were consistent with an increased need to forage as nutrient reserves declined through incubation as expected due to energetic constraints...|$|R
