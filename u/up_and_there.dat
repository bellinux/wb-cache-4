25|$|Amateur {{radio or}} ham radio is practised {{by more than}} 16,000 {{licensed}} users in India. The first amateur radio operator was licensed in 1921, and by the mid-1930s, there were around 20 amateur radio operators in India. Amateur radio operators played {{an important part in}} the Indian independence movement with the establishment of illegal pro-independence radio stations in the 1940s. The three decades after India's independence saw only slow growth in the numbers of operators until the then Prime Minister of India and amateur radio operator, Rajiv Gandhi (VU2RG), waived the import duty on wireless equipment in 1984. Since then, numbers have picked <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> , <b>there</b> were more than 16,000 operators in the country. Amateur radio operators have played a vital role during disasters and national emergencies such as earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, floods, and bomb blasts, by providing voluntary emergency communications in the affected areas.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the latter}} 2000s, the {{municipality}} {{has been struggling}} with water shortages due to drought conditions.

However, {{there is no evidence}} that Barrie had sexual contact with children, nor that he was suspected of it at the time. Nico, the youngest of the brothers, denied as an adult that Barrie ever behaved inappropriately. [...] "I don't believe that Uncle Jim ever experienced what one might call 'a stirring in the undergrowth' for anyone—man, woman, or child", he stated.

2500|$|Irregular cast silver ingots {{circulated}} {{from about}} 11th to early 12th centuries. Only one such example is known from Lithuania, found in 1938 in Graužiai. Around {{the second half}} of the 12th century, supply of minted Western European coins dried <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>there</b> was no centralized power in Eastern Europe to take up coin mintage. The period is known as [...] "coinless period". However, merchants needed a means of exchange. Therefore, a local system of cast silver ingots was developed. While silver was imported (there are no silver mines in the region; the main mining area was in the Upper Harz in Germany), the ingots were cast locally. At first, a wax model was created. Then it was coated with clay and fired in a furnace inside a clay or sand pit. The wax would melt leaving a mold for the ingot. Molten silver was poured into the mold using a special clay scoop. After cooling off, the mold was broken to remove the ingot. Therefore, most molds were one-time use though a few examples of ingots are known that were cast using the same mold. Because of this technique, archaeologists have not discovered any furnaces or molds, only clay spoons and pouring cups.|$|E
2500|$|Another way of {{thinking}} about associations' property, that came to be the dominant and practical view, was first stated by Brightman J in Re Recher's Will Trusts. Here it was said that, if no words are used that indicate a trust is intended, a [...] "gift takes effect in favour of the existing members of the association as an accretion to the funds which are the subject-matter of the contract". In other words, property will be held according to the members' contractual terms of their association. This matters for deciding whether a gift will succeed or be held to fail, although that possibility is unlikely on any contemporary view. It also matters where an association is being wound <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>there</b> is a dispute over who should take the remaining property. In a recent decision, Hanchett‐Stamford v Attorney‐General Lewison J held that the final surviving member of the [...] "Performing and Captive Animals Defence League" [...] was entitled to the remaining property of the association, although while the association was running any money could not be used for the members' private purposes. On the other hand, if money is donated to an organisation, and specifically intended to be passed onto others, then the end of an association could mean that remaining assets will go back to the people the money came from (on [...] "resulting trust") or be bona vacantia. In Re West Sussex Constabulary's Widows, Children and Benevolent (1930) Fund Trusts, Goff J held that a fund set up for the dependants of police staff, which was being wound up, which had been given money expressly for reason of benefiting dependants (and not to benefit the members of the trust) could not be taken by those members. The rules have also mattered, however for the purpose of taxation. In Conservative and Unionist Central Office v Burrell it was held that the Conservative Party, and its various limbs and branches, was not all bound together by a contract, and so not subject to corporation tax.|$|E
