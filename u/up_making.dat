5|$|In {{supplying}} this demand, the ice trade increasingly shifted north, {{away from}} Massachusetts and towards Maine. Various factors contributed to this. New Englands' winters became warmer during the 19th century, while industrialisation {{resulted in more}} of the natural ponds and rivers becoming contaminated. Less trade was brought through New England as other ways of reaching western US markets were opened <b>up,</b> <b>making</b> it less profitable to trade ice from Boston, while the cost of producing ships in the region increased due to deforestation. Finally, in 1860 there {{was the first of}} four ice famines along the Hudson-warm winters that prevented the formation of ice in New England-creating shortages and driving up prices.|$|E

40|$|The {{modern world}} is complex beyond human {{understanding}} and control. The science of complex systems aims {{to find new}} ways of thinking about the many interconnected networks of interaction that defy traditional approaches. Thus far, research into networks has largely been restricted to pairwise relationships represented by links between two nodes. This volume marks a major extension of networks to multidimensional hypernetworks for modeling multi-element relationships, such as companies <b>making</b> <b>up</b> the stock market, the neighborhoods forming a city, people <b>making</b> <b>up</b> committees, divisions <b>making</b> <b>up</b> companies, computers <b>making</b> <b>up</b> the internet, men and machines <b>making</b> <b>up</b> armies, or robots working as teams. This volume makes an important contribution to the science of complex systems by: (i) extending network theory to include dynamic relationships between many elements; (ii) providing a mathematical theory able to integrate multilevel dynamics in a coherent way; (iii) providing a new methodological approach to analyze complex systems; and (iv) illustrating the theory with practical examples in the design, management and control of complex systems taken from many areas of application...|$|R

5|$|By {{the later}} seventeenth century both the Presbyterian and episcopalian {{wings of the}} church had adopted the {{modestly}} sized and plain form of churches that had emerged after the Reformation. Most had a centralised plan {{with two or three}} arms, in a rectangular or T-planned arrangement. Steeples continued to be a major feature, either centrally on the long axis, or on an end gable, in as had been the case in pre-Reformation churches. As a result, there was little of the baroque extravagance in church building seen on the Continent and England. Some minor innovations may indicate a move back toward episcopacy in the Restoration era. Lauder Church was built by Sir William Bruce in 1673 for the Duke of Lauderdale, who championed the bishops in the reign of Charles II and the Gothic windows of which may have emphasised antiquity, but its basic Greek cross plan remained within the common framework of new churches. The drive to episcopalian forms of worship may have resulted in more linear patterns, including rectangular plans with the pulpit on the end opposite the entrance. The major exceptions to the standard pattern are in the work of James Smith, who had become a Jesuit in his youth. These included the rebuilding of Holyrood Abbey undertaken for James VII in 1687, which was outfitted in an elaborate style. In 1691 Smith designed the mausoleum of Sir George Mackenzie of Rosehaugh, in Greyfriars Kirkyard, a circular structure modelled on the Tempietto di San Pietro, designed by Donato Bramante (1444â€“1514). The Latin Cross form, increasingly popular in Counter Reformation Catholicism, was also used, as in Smith's Canongate Kirk (1688â€“90), but here it never saw episcopal service as the Presbyterian revolution of 1689â€“90 occurred before it was completed and the chancel was blocked <b>up,</b> <b>making</b> it, in effect, a T-plan.|$|E
5|$|For the Battle of Romani, Chauvel {{chose his}} ground carefully, reconnoitring {{it from the}} ground and the air, and {{selecting}} both forward and fall back positions. His luck held; the German commanderâ€” Friedrich KreÃŸ von Kressensteinâ€” selected the same position as the forming up area for his attack in August 1916. Under great pressure, Chauvel maintained his position until Brigadier-General Edward Chaytor's New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade arrived after being released by Lawrence. The counter-attack that Chauvel had been calling for all day did not materialise until dusk. At Katia and again at Bir el Abd, Chauvel attempted to sweep around the Turkish flank but wound <b>up</b> <b>making</b> frontal attacks on the Turkish rearguard and was beaten off by determined counter-attacks and artillery fire against the 3rd Light Horse Brigade. Despite killing 1,250 Turks and taking over 4,000 prisoners, Chauvel was criticised for his failure to rout and destroy the Turks. However, for the Australian and New Zealand horsemen, who suffered over 900 of the 1,130British casualties, it was a clear-cut victory, their first decisive win and the turning point of the campaign. Later, Chauvel realised that Romani was the first decisive British victory of the war outside West Africa Campaign.|$|E

After he went undrafted in the 1997 NFL Draft he signed with the Pittsburgh Steelers. With Pittsburgh, he ended <b>up</b> <b>making</b> the roster as the thirdstring quarterback. Following the season, he was allocated to the Rhein Fire, whom he led to the championship game. He spent 1998 and 1999 as a backup for the Indianapolis Colts and Dallas Cowboys before signing with the Miami Dolphins. Quinn spent two seasons backing up for the Dolphins. In 2002, {{he was one of the}} first group of players signed by the National Football League (NFL) expansion franchise, the Houston Texans. As he had done for the previous years in his career, Quinn spent two seasons as a backup for the new franchise. The final year of his NFL career was spent with the Denver Broncos in training camp and with the Steelers' practice squad. After going unsigned, Quinn signed with the Montreal Alouettes joining their practice squad in August 2005, leaving the team after the season. Quinn joined another Canadian team, the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in March 2006 but after receiving playing time in a backup role he was released later that year, in August.|$|E

However, soon his memory returns, and he reunites with Phyllis and Summer. Jack, Phyllis, Nick and Sharon soon start a business venture, creating a new magazine entitled Restless Style. However, the four constantly clash, and Jack and Sharon are driven out of the company. However, Nick and Sharon grow closer. While in Paris searching for a teenage Noah, Nick and Sharon share a kiss on the bridge, which is witnessed by Phyllis. Back in Genoa City, Nick and Sharon are snowed in at the Abbott cabin and end <b>up</b> <b>making</b> love. Their emotional affair continues, and they sleep together a second time three months later.

Faith is eventually returned to her parents, after Sharon developed a relationship and married a manipulative Adam, unaware of his actions. Nick's marriage to Phyllis is over by this point.|$|E
