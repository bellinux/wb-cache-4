25|$|Qualitative {{research}} is sometimes {{said to have}} as its goal {{the understanding of the}} sample studied, rather than generalizing from the sample to the population. However, the results of qualitative research can be applied to other settings—as long as the reader of the research understands the limitations. For example, the research findings of a qualitative case study of primary school children in a particular school and their mobile phone usage will tell <b>us</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the mobile phone usage of children in the general population, than of adults. However, the type of school (public or private), where it was located, and the socio-economic background of the students need to be taken into consideration when applying any findings to other settings (either schools or the general population of children).|$|E

Nixon {{suggested}} in Jane Austen in Hollywood that Darcy's dive is a [...] "revelation of his emotional capabilities", expressing a [...] "Romantic bond with nature, {{a celebration of}} his home where he can 'strip down' to his essential self, a cleansing of social prejudices from his mind, or...a rebirth of his love for Elizabeth". Linda Troost and Sayre Greenfield wrote that the scene [...] "tells <b>us</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> our current decade's obsession with physical perfection and acceptance of gratuitous nudity than it does about Austen's Darcy, but the image carves a new facet into the text".|$|E
500|$|The {{stereotyping}} of Native Americans must {{be understood}} {{in the context of}} history which includes conquest, forced relocation, and organized efforts to eradicate native cultures, such as the boarding schools of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which separated young Native Americans from their families in order to educate them as European Americans.

She also was pleased with Peter's reactions to the obstacles thrown in his path, but criticized the writing for having another man behind the murders ('Too much coincidence. Way too much coincidence. From a plotting standpoint, it was clumsy'). Stegall concluded her review by praising all of the actors' performances, explaining that other than the [...] "clumsy" [...] killer plot twist, [...] "I had no complaints at all about this episode. The supporting cast was top notch". Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly enjoyed how the episode mystery was processed from Peter's point of view, and loved the revelation at the end about Walternate. MTV columnist Josh Wigler praised the episode's [...] "pretty mature storytelling" [...] for not making Peter [...] "go on an angry rampage" [...] or become [...] "an angsty ball of self-loathing" [...] after the previous episode's events. He continued, [...] "You can see that he's hurting, but he's still not quite sure how to process everything. Excellent work from the writers and Joshua Jackson".|$|E

500|$|GayNZ writer Craig Young places Ianto, like Buffys Tara, in {{a larger}} {{literary}} tradition, commenting [...] "just as Iphigenia's sacrifice {{at the hands of}} Agamemnon was necessary to set in train the events of Aeschylus's Oresteia... just as Ophelia's madness, suicide and accidental death led to the climatic duel between Hamlet and Laertes ... Ianto's death can be argued to be a dramatic necessity which adds to character and narrative development." [...] The article acknowledged there being some validity in criticisms of modern TV dramas which uphold that it is frequently the gay relationships which [...] "can never be seen to have long-term, fulfilled relationships". However, GayNZ questioned whether the pattern was solely gay, noting the equally tragic outcomes of homosexual and heterosexual relationships in American shows Buffy and Nip/Tuck. The website also took note of Ianto fans' displeasure when Jack was introduced to a new romantic partner in Alonso Frame (Russell Tovey) in Doctor Who episode The End of Time (2010), mirroring Willow's romance with Kennedy (Iyari Limon) in Season Seven of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The article intentionally avoided making a definitive conclusion as to which [...] "side" [...] of the argument was correct. Young later compared Ianto's death with the subsequent killing off of core heterosexual couples in two British shows, Misfits and Being Human. These latter deaths are described as even more heartbreaking than Ianto's, and Young argues that these character deaths tell <b>us</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> transatlantic differences in storytelling than about portrayals of sexuality.|$|E

2500|$|Newman's celibacy, {{which he}} embraced {{at the age}} of 15, also contributed to {{negative}} representations of his character, laying him open to what he called [...] "slurs". To exponents of Muscular Christianity such as Charles Kingsley, celibacy was synonymous with unmanliness. Kingsley, who interpreted the Biblical story of Adam and Eve as expressing a [...] "binary law of man's being; the want of a complementum, a 'help meet', without whom it is not good for him to be", feared and hated vowed sexual abstinence, considering it, in Laura Fasick's words, [...] "a distinct and separate perversion". The charge of effeminacy was aimed not just at Newman but at Tractarians and Roman Catholics in general. [...] "In all that school", wrote Kingsley in 1851, [...] "there is an element of foppery – even in dress and manner; a fastidious, maundering, die-away effeminacy, which is mistaken for purity and refinement". John Cornwell comments that [...] "the notion of Newman's effeminacy tells <b>us</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the reaction of others to him at the time than [...] any tendency in his own nature".|$|E
