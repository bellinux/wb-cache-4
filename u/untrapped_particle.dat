40|$|The {{relationship}} between anomalous superdiffusive behavior and particle trapping probability is analyzed on a rocking ratchet potential with spatially correlated weak disorder. The trapping probability {{allows us to}} obtain analytical expressions {{for the number of}} wells where a given number of particles get trapped. We have also calculated the second-moment of the particle distribution function $C_ 2 $ as a function of time, when the <b>untrapped</b> <b>particle</b> has a constant velocity. We also use the expression for $C_ 2 $ to characterize anomalous superdiffusive motion. Comment: 13 pages, 8 figure...|$|E
40|$|Several {{analyses}} of self-segregation properties of reaction-diffusion systems in low dimensions {{have been based}} on a simplified model in which an initially uniform concentration of point particles is depleted by reaction with an immobilized trap. A measure of self-segregation in this system is the distance of the trap from the nearest <b>untrapped</b> <b>particle.</b> In one dimension the average of this distance has been shown to increase at a rate proportional to t 1 / 4. We show that this rate in a two-dimensional system is asymptotically proportional to (In t) 1 / 2, and that the concentration profile in the neighborhood of the trap is proportional to (ln r/ln t) ...|$|E

The average axial electric field is expressed as ⟨E_{z}⟩=-(∂/∂z) ⟨ϕ⟩=-e_{b}g_{ 0 }∂λ_{b}/∂z-e_{b}g_{ 2 }r_{w}^{ 2 }∂^{ 3 }λ_{b}/∂z^{ 3 }, where g_{ 0 } and g_{ 2 } are constant geometric factors, λ_{b}(z,t) =∫dp_{z}F_{b}(z,p_{z},t) is the line density of beam particles, and F_{b}(z,p_{z},t) satisfies the 1 D Vlasov equation. Detailed nonlinear properties of traveling-wave and traveling-pulse (soliton) solutions with time-stationary waveform are examined {{for a wide range}} of system parameters extending from moderate-amplitudes to large-amplitude modulations of the beam charge density. Two classes of solutions for the beam distribution function are considered, corresponding to: (i)  the nonlinear waterbag distribution, where F_{b}=const in a bounded region of p_{z}-space; and (ii)  nonlinear Bernstein-Green-Kruskal (BGK) -like solutions, allowing for both trapped and <b>untrapped</b> <b>particle</b> distributions to interact with the self-generated electric field ⟨E_{z}⟩...|$|E
40|$|Contributions of {{trapped and}} <b>untrapped</b> <b>particles</b> to the {{transverse}} and longitudinal dielectric per-mittivity elements are present for radio-frequency waves in a tokamak with circular cross-sections {{of the magnetic}} surfaces and arbitrary aspect ratio. Imaginary parts of the longitudinal permittivity elements are important to estimate the wave power absorbed by electron Landau damping (e. g., during the plasma heating and current drive generation) in the frequency range of Alfven, fast magnetosonic, and lower hybrid waves. Whereas, imaginary parts of the transverse permittivity elements are necessary to estimate the cyclotron-resonant wave dissipation at the fundamental cy-clotron frequency of ions and/or electrons. The dissipated wave power is expressed by summation of terms including the separate contributions of trapped and <b>untrapped</b> <b>particles</b> to the imaginary parts of both the diagonal and non-diagonal elements of the dielectric permittivity. The concrete computations are carried out for a tokamak plasma with the main TCABR parameters. ...|$|R

40|$|When a quasi-monochromatic wave {{propagating}} in an inhomogeneous magnetoplasma has sufficiently large amplitude, {{there exist}} phase-trapped resonant particles whose energy increases or decreases {{depending on the}} "sign" of inhomogeneity. The variation of energy density of such particles can greatly exceed the wave energy density which contradicts energy conservation under the prevalent assumption that the wave serves as the energy source or sink. We show that, in fact, the energy increase (or decrease) of phase-trapped particles is related to energy transfer from (to) phase <b>untrapped</b> <b>particles,</b> while the wave basically mediates the energization process. Virtual importance of this comprehension consists in setting proper quantitative constraints on attainable particle energy. The results have immediate applications to at least two fundamental problems in the magnetospheric physics, i. e. particle dynamics in the radiation belts and whistler-triggered emissions...|$|R

This technique, which has been successfully demonstrated at the Advanced Light Source, mixes the synchrotron radiation with the light from a mode-locked solid state laser oscillator in a non-linear crystal. The up-converted radiation is then detected with a photomultiplier and processed to extract, store, and display the required information. The available choices of laser repetition frequency, pulse width, and phase modulation give a wide range of options for matching the bunch configuration of a particular storage ring. Besides the dynamic measurement of the longitudinal profile of each bunch, the instrument can monitor the evolution of the bunch tails, the presence of <b>untrapped</b> <b>particles</b> and their diffusion into nominally empty RF buckets ("ghost bunches") ...|$|R
40|$|Mobility {{properties}} {{inside and}} around degenerate domains of an elastic lattice partially pinned on a square array of traps are explored {{by means of}} a fully controllable model system of macroscopic particles. We focus on the different configurations obtained for filling ratios equal to 1 or 2 when the pinning strength is lowered. These theoretically expected but never observed configurations are degenerated, which implies the existence of a multidomain crystal. We show that the distinction between trapped and <b>untrapped</b> <b>particles</b> that is made in the case of strong pinning is not relevant for such a weaker pinning. Indeed, one ought to distinguish between particles inside or around the domains associated to positional degeneracies. The possible consequences on the depinning dynamics of the lattice are discussed. Comment: 7 pages, 10 figures Version 2 : longer versio...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{development}} of an instrument for the measurement of the longitudinal beam profile in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).

The up-converted radiation is then detected with a photomultiplier and processed to extract, store and display the required information. A 40 MHz laser, phase-locked to the ring radio frequency system, with a 50 ps pulse length, would be suitable for measuring the dynamics of the core of each of the LHC 2808 bunches in a time span much shorter than the synchrotron period. The same instrument could also monitor the evolution of the bunch tails, the presence of <b>untrapped</b> <b>particles</b> and their diffusion into nominally empty RF buckets ("ghost bunches") as required by the CERN specifications...|$|R
40|$|When a wave propagates without {{changing}} its shape, particles move along constant energy orbits in the wave frame. Thus the distribution function is known at all points in phase space {{if it is}} specified at some position, say x = xo. If we take the distribu-tion function to be Maxwellian at x = xo, 2 2 f(x o,v) = n f 7 e- v = n o N e-P(u + w) O O O (1) where p = 2 m/kT, u is the phase velocity, and w is the particle velocity in the wave frame; the distribution function at other points is obtained as (1) evolves along constant energy orbits. f(x, v) = n 0 e-I (u + c) 2 where c = W 1 - 2 e/mw 2 (2) (3) and c is the wave potential.

40|$|The {{equilibrium}} of an infinitely long, strongly magnetized, non-neutral plasma {{confined in}} a Penning-Malmberg trap {{with an additional}} mirror coil has been solved analytically [J. Fajans, Phys. Plasmas 10, 1209 (2003) ] and shown to exhibit unusual features. Particles not only reflect near the mirror in the low field region, but also may be weakly trapped in part of in the high field region. The plasma satisfies a Boltzmann distribution along field lines; however, the density and the potential vary along field lines. Some other simplifying assumptions were employed in order to analytically characterize the equilibrium; for example the interface region between the low and high field regions was not considered. The earlier results are confirmed in the present study, where two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations are performed with the Warp code in a more realistic configuration with an arbitrary (but physical) density profile, realistic trap geometry and magnetic field. A range of temperatures and radial plasma sizes are considered. Particle tracking is used to identify populations of trapped and <b>untrapped</b> <b>particles.</b> The present study also shows {{that it is possible}} to obtain local equilibria of non-neutral plasmas using a collisionless PIC code, by a scheme that uses the inherent numerical collisionality as a proxy for physical collisions...|$|R
40|$|Antimatter, though {{proposed}} in 1933, {{is still not}} well understood. AEgIS aims to study the interaction of antihydrogen with the earth's gravitational field. This information will {{add to our understanding}} of the matter-antimatter asymmetry present in our universe. This paper discusses a Penning-Malmberg with a magnetic mirror that will hold C_ 2 ^- that will be used for sympathetic cooling of antiprotons before the antihydrogen is created. The trap, which is critical to the cooling process of the antihydrogen, can be characterized by the separatrix between trapped and <b>untrapped</b> <b>particles.</b> This paper applies analytical processes used to define the separatrix of pure electron plasmas to a molecular plasma. Our work is based on the desire conditions (density, particle number, field strength, trap size) of the high field region. The initial application of a semi-analytical method applied to our trap defines the trap potential difference at 0 ̃. 6 V. The separatrix is defined in both the high and low field region, by an ellipse and a hyperbola respectively. This shape varies from the separatrix of a Penning trap with a constant axial magnetic field. Now that we have successfully applied this method to the our C_ 2 ^- trap and defined the high and low field separatrices, we may move forward with a better understanding of the cooling process that the carbon molecule will undergo...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} {{development}} of a new storage ring operations tool for measurement of longitudinal beam density profile. The technique mixes synchrotron light with light from a mode locked solid-state laser oscillator in a non-linear crystal and detects the up-converted radiation with a photo-multiplier. The laser is phase locked to the storage ring RF system. The laser choices available for repetition frequency, pulse length and phase modulation give a very wide range of options for matching the bunch configuration of particular storage rings. Progress in the technology of solid-state lasers ensures this system can be made robust for routine use in storage ring operations. A very large number of important applications are possible including measurement of the fraction of <b>untrapped</b> <b>particles</b> prior to acceleration, the population of particles in the nominally unfilled RF buckets in a bunch train ("ghost bunches"), longitudinal tails, the diffusion of particles into the beam abort gap and the normal bunch parameters of longitudinal shape and intensity. We are currently investigating application to two devices: (1) the 1. 9 GeV ALS electron storage ring at LBNL with 328 RF buckets, 2 ns bucket spacing, 276 nominally filled bunches, 15 - 30 ps rms bunch length and (2) the 7 TeV LHC proton collider under construction at CERN with 35, 640 RF buckets, 2. 5 ns bucket spacing, 2, 808 nominally filled bunches, 280 - 620 ps rms bunch length.

40|$|We {{consider}} a random stationary magnetic field with zero average magnetic field, = 0. In {{the case when}} carriers of electric current, that creates a field, are electrons the field is force-free, curl B = α B. In a small region, in which the coefficient of α and the strength |B| can be considered constants, the force-free field is the vector rotating in the direction perpendicular to the plane in which magnetic field lines lie. The motion of a charged particle in such a field is described by a mathematical pendulum and continuously traces the transition from magnetized motion, when the cyclotron radius r_c less than the characteristic scale of inhomogeneity L = 2 π/α (trapped particles), to almost free, when r_c> L (<b>untrapped</b> <b>particles).</b> For the cosmic rays in the Galaxy, {{in which there are}} wide ranges of large-scale field strength B_LS and the correlation length L_ 0, averaging over these values gives the dependence of the diffusion coefficient as the fractional power of the Larmor radius r_m in the maximum large-scale field, D∝ r_m^(1 - σ) /(1 + β). The value of β is the index of the spectrum of the large-scale field, B_LS∝ L_ 0 ^β, and 1 - σ is the index in the distribution function f(L_ 0) over scales, f(L_ 0) ∝ L_ 0 ^- 1 + σ. For the Kolmogorov spectrum of the magnetic field, β = 1 / 3, and almost flat spectrum over scales, σ = 1 / 15, the value of the index (1 - σ) /(1 + β) is 0. 7, which corresponds to observed dependence of the diffusion of cosmic rays in the Galaxy over their energy.

40|$|Transverse and {{longitudinal}} dielectric permittivity {{elements are}} derived for radio frequency waves {{in a laboratory}} dipole magnetic field plasma (LDMFP) accounting for the finite ring current radius. The main feature of LDMFP is the fact that, in contrast to planetary magnetospheric plasmas, the <b>untrapped</b> (circulating) <b>particles</b> can exist/circulate (together with the trapped particles) along the equilibrium magnetic field lines. To estimate the wave power absorbed in LDMFP the perturbed electric field and current density components are decomposed in a Fourier series over the poloidal angle. The wave absorption is expressed by the summation of contributions of all harmonics of the perturbed electric field and both the diagonal and non-diagonal dielectric permittivity elements. In this paper, we analyze numerically the separate contributions of the trapped and untrapped electrons to the imaginary part of the longitudinal permittivity elements in LDMFP with an equilibrium (Maxwellian) distribution functions of plasma particles in velocity space. This information is necessary to estimate the collisionless wave dissipation by electron Landau damping. The computations are carried out {{in a wide range}} of the wave frequencies.

40|$|Starting in 1994 {{with the}} first {{obtained}} plasma crystal, the study of dusty plasmas developed explosively since then as an autonomous research field. The dynamic equilibrium of forces acting on micro-spheres in the plasma is a fundamental problem for understanding the dynamics of complex plasmas. The most relevant forces are gravitation force, neutral gas friction, electric field force, ion drag and thermophoresis. The last two are introduced into the plasma physics only in connection to dusty plasma. Even though they are usually very small compared to the particle weight, they become very important when the gravitation is reduced, {{as in the case}} of microgravity experiments, or by falling particles in our second experiment. In this thesis two experiments on the forces acting on dust particles are presented under two completely different conditions: in the plasma sheath, and in the plasma bulk. These two situations differ by the fact that the sheath is a non-equilibrium environment governed by directional ion flows, where the particles are always trapped in 2 D structures, while the plasma bulk is an equilibrium environment, where the particle trapping is possible under microgravity conditions, when 3 D particle systems can be studied. In the first experiment, nonlinear oscillations of individual micro-spheres have been excited in the plasma sheath by low frequency modulation of the RF power applied to the electrode. The potential well of the particles trapped within the sheath is determined exclusively by the balance of the gravitation force and the electric field force. Other forces like thermophoresis or ion drag are about one order of magnitude smaller than the gravitation under these conditions and act in the same vertical direction as the weight force. From the characteristics of the nonlinear resonances, the contributions of electric field and the particle charging to the observed nonlinearity have been derived. It was found that the nonlinearity can be fully attributed to the position dependent charge of the particles. This oscillation method is a reliable technique for determining the forces acting on particles trapped in the non-equilibrium sheath. In the second experiment, the behaviour of free falling particles through a long plasma column is studied. This is a novel experimental approach to the study of the forces acting on the charged particles. The gravitation force is balanced in the vertical direction by the neutral gas friction force. Smaller forces like thermophoresis or ion drag act in the radial direction and this allows to decouple the dominant vertical forces from the more subtle ones, which act horizontally. The study of the radial forces is carried out for various plasma conditions, by analysing the trajectories of the falling particles. From the experiments, a good agreement with theoretical models of the thermophoretic and ion drag force is obtained. This approach provides accurate qualitative and quantitative results on the acting forces and allows direct comparisons with dusty plasma experiments under microgravity conditions e. g. in questions of the mechanism of the "void" phenomenon. Concluding, this thesis offers reliable methods of analysis for investigating both trapped and <b>untrapped</b> <b>particles</b> for an improved understanding of dynamic processes in complex plasmas...|$|R
40|$|The Hamiltonian Mean Field (HMF) {{model is}} a {{prototype}} for systems with long-range interactions. It describes the motion of N particles moving on a ring, coupled through an infinite-range potential. The model has a second order phase transition at the energy U_c= 3 / 4 and its dynamics is exactly described by the Vlasov equation in the N →∞ limit. Its chaotic properties have been investigated in the past, but {{the determination of the}} scaling with N of the Lyapunov Spectrum (LS) of the model remains a challenging open problem. We here show that the N^- 1 / 3 scaling of the Maximal Lyapunov Exponent (MLE), found in previous numerical and analytical studies, extends to the full LS; not only, scaling is "precocious" for the LS, meaning that it becomes manifest for a much smaller number of particles than the one needed to check the scaling for the MLE. Besides that, the N^- 1 / 3 scaling appears to be valid not only for U>U_c, as suggested by theoretical approaches based on a random matrix approximation, but also below a threshold energy U_t ≈ 0. 2. Using a recently proposed method (GALI) devised to rapidly check the chaotic or regular nature of an orbit, we find that U_t is also the energy at which a sharp transition from weak to strong chaos is present in the phase-space of the model. Around this energy the phase of the vector order parameter of the model becomes strongly time dependent, inducing a significant <b>untrapping</b> of <b>particles</b> from a nonlinear resonance.
