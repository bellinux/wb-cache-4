40|$|Postbuckling {{solutions}} of laminated rectangular {{plates are}} {{obtained by the}} Rayleigh-Ritz method using von Karman's nonlinear strain displacement relations and high-order polynomial expansions of the displacements. The potential energy function and the nonlinear algebraic equations governing the undetermined coefficients are obtained by Mathematica. Reasonably accurate solutions for the membrane forces, the bending and twisting moments and the pointwise energy-release rates generally require more <b>undeterminated</b> <b>coefficients.</b> Such refined postbuckling solutions show significant non-uniformity of the in-plane forces and strains and certain boundary effects characterized by concentration of the curvatures and the bending moment.

40|$|Introduction It is {{very rare}} that a linear {{differential}} equation with analytic coefficients admits a closed-form solution. However, a lot of local informations can be obtained directly from the equation. For instance, {{it is well known}} that at an ordinary point the Taylor series of a solution can be computed by <b>undeterminate</b> <b>coefficients.</b> It is also possible to compute formal local expansions of the solutions of a linear differential equation, or equivalently a first order linear system, in the neighbourhood of a singularity. Singularities are found to be either poles of the coefficients or roots of the coefficient of highest order. Suppose the singularity of the equation is at the origin, or you move it there by a change of variable. Then a fundamental object to compute is the Newton polygon. It is obtained by taking the upper-left convex hull of the set of points (i; j Γ i) such that x j...|$|R
40|$|Divergent series arise {{naturally}} {{in many different}} contexts. This talk describes mixed symbolic-numerical algorithms {{to deal with these}} series when they arise from linear differential equations. Introduction A simple example of a divergent numerical series is obtained when summing a Taylor series outside its circle of convergence. More violent divergence is encountered when solving a linear differential equation like the Euler equation x 2 y 0 + y = x by an <b>undeterminate</b> <b>coefficient</b> method. The power series one obtains is the Euler series X n 0 (Γ 1) n n!x n+ 1; which has a radius of convergence equal to 0. This problem also occurs in non-linear differential equations, singular perturbations, difference equations, or asymptotic analysis (e. g., by the Laplace method). The Borel-Ritt theorem states that any power series on any sector of finite opening in the complex plane is the asymptotic expansion of a function which is analytic in the sector. However, this analyt [...] ...|$|R
