25|$|<b>USINT</b> Havana and its counterpart, the Interests Section of the Republic of Cuba in Washington, were {{formally}} {{sections of}} the respective Embassies of Switzerland, although they operated independently of the Swiss in virtually all but protocol respects. During this period, the United States and Cuba did not operate embassies in each other's countries, and their respective Interests Sections functioned as de facto embassies.The last Section Chief of <b>USINT</b> Havana was Jeffrey DeLaurentis, who served from August 2014 to its termination in 2015.

25|$|During the Elián González case, {{the area}} {{to the east of}} <b>USINT</b> (previously a grassed area {{containing}} the above-mentioned billboard) was paved and a stage was built.

25|$|The United States Interests Section of the Embassy of Switzerland in Havana, Cuba or <b>USINT</b> Havana (the State Department telegraphic address) {{represented}} United States {{interests in}} Cuba from September 1, 1977, to July 20, 2015. It was staffed by United States Foreign Service personnel and local staff {{employed by the}} US Department of State, and located in a multi-story office building on the Malecón across from the Plaza de la Revolución in Havana.

[...] – [...] "Mr. Imperialists, We have absolutely no fear of you!" [...] In 2005 the billboard was repositioned to a nearby site so that faces across the sea to Florida.|$|E

The Cuban government, in response to Section Chief James Cason's refusal to remove the sign, placed several large billboards facing the building, carrying images of the abuse in Abu Ghraib and references to Nazis.|$|E

[...] Following a protest march, the Cuban government erected a large number of poles, carrying black flags with single white stars, obscuring the messages. In June 2006, Granma International referred to the billboard as [...] "the systematic launching of the crudest insults of our people via the electronic billboard, which, in violation of the most elemental regulations of international law, they think they can maintain with impunity on the facade of that imperial lair." ...|$|E

30|$|As {{described}} in a previous work [10], {{the use of an}} ultrasonic homogenizer improves nanofluid stability over other alternatives available to disperse the nanoparticles, and so a (<b>U.S.int)</b> BandelinSonoplus HD 2200 was used (Bandelin Electronic, Berlin, Germany), with typical sonication times of 16 min. In order to check the morphology and size distribution of the fluid samples, transmission electron microscope technique was used [10]. An estimate of the size distribution in each case was obtained using ImageTool freeware software [URL] The volume-weighted average diameter values computed were D = 43 ± 23 nm for S 1 and D = 8 ± 3 nm for S 2 [10]. More details about sample preparation and characterizations are given in [10, 30].|$|E
40|$|Two {{methods were}} {{employed}} to measure the rate of ribonucleic acid (RNA) chain growth in vivo in Mycobacterium tuberculosis H 37 Rv cultures growing in Sauton medium at 37 degrees C, with a generation time of 10 h. In the first, the bacteria were allowed to assimilate [3 H]uracil or [3 H]guanine into their RNA for short time periods. The RNA was then extracted and hydrolyzed with alkali, and the radioactivity in the resulting nucleotides and nucleosides was measured. The data obtained by this method allowed the calculation of the individual nucleotide step times during the growth of RNA chains, from which the average rate of RNA chain elongation {{was estimated to be}} about 4 nucleotides per s. The second method employed the antibiotic rifampin, which specifically inhibits the initiation of RNA synthesis without interfering with the elongation and completion of nascent RNA chains. <b>Usint</b> this method, the transcription time of the 16 S, 23 S, and 5 S ribosomal RNA genes was estimated to be 7. 6 min, which corresponds to a ribosomal RNA chain growth rate of 10 nucleotides per s...|$|E
