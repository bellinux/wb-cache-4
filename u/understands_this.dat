5|$|Kyle, Cartman and Kenny {{surprise}} Stan {{by creating}} a Facebook account for him. Stan protests, but is quickly pressured by family and friends to add them as friends. To his annoyance and frustration, Stan finds people such as Randy, his grandmother and even Wendy confronting him over his supposed disregard for them and judging his real-world friendship solely by his Facebook configuration. Meanwhile, Kyle adds shy nerdy student Kip Drordy (anagram: Dorky Drip) to his thriving friends list out of pity. Kyle's number of Facebook friends rapidly declines when he does this, {{in part due to}} a Mad Friends podcast he finds Cartman has set up in which he berates Kyle for choosing a loser as a friend and asserts nobody will want to hang out with Kyle. Kyle <b>understands</b> <b>this,</b> but, on principle and out of pity, cannot bring himself to delete Kip to please others. Desperate to stem the loss of friends, he asks Cartman for advice. Cartman introduces Kyle to Chatroulette as a way to make new friends, which fails as most {{of the people on the}} site are either jacking off or showing their genitals, until Cartman finally finds another Jewish kid named Isiah, who agrees to be Kyle's friend, much to Kyle's delight.|$|E

25|$|The Iconoclasm (730–787 and 813–843) was a {{movement}} within the Byzantine church {{to establish that}} the Christian culture of portraits (see icon) {{of the family of}} Christ and subsequent Christians and biblical scenes were not of a Christian origin and therefore heretical. The group destroyed much of the Christian churches' art history, until it was later defined as heretical itself under the Seventh Ecumenical council. The iconoclasts considered the tradition of icons as contrary to the ban on 'graven images', interpretated in a narrow sense as 'engraved or carved'. This forbade many of the ornaments that Moses was commanded to create in the passages right after the commandment was given, i.e., cherubim., as well as the Cross and other holy artifacts. The Orthodox Church <b>understands</b> <b>this</b> in a wider sense as a ban on no carved images: the people of God are not to create idols and then worship them.|$|E
25|$|The mirror stage {{describes}} {{the formation of}} the Ego via the process of objectification, the Ego being the result of a conflict between one's perceived visual appearance and one's emotional experience. This identification is what Lacan called alienation. At six months, the baby still lacks physical co-ordination. The child is able to recognize themselves in a mirror prior to the attainment of control over their bodily movements. The child sees their image as a whole and the synthesis of this image produces a sense of contrast with the lack of co-ordination of the body, which is perceived as a fragmented body. The child experiences this contrast initially as a rivalry with their image, because the wholeness of the image threatens the child with fragmentation—thus the mirror stage gives rise to an aggressive tension between the subject and the image. To resolve this aggressive tension, the child identifies with the image: this primary identification with the counterpart forms the Ego. Lacan <b>understands</b> <b>this</b> moment of identification as a moment of jubilation, since it leads to an imaginary sense of mastery; yet when the child compares their own precarious sense of mastery with the omnipotence of the mother, a depressive reaction may accompany the jubilation.|$|E

Michael Paoletta from Billboard {{gave it a}} very positive review, calling the album a reminder of why the decade has been Dion's signature era – and why the future looks bright for her. According to him, regarding seven new songs, All the Way... A Decade of Song is Dion's most focused album yet, drawing on a team of collaborators that <b>understands</b> <b>this</b> artists's strengths.

At one point on the video, Pearl said: [...] "My father is Jewish, my mother is Jewish, I am Jewish," [...] after which Pearl added one obscure detail, that a street in Israel's Bnei Brak is named after his great grandfather, {{who was one of}} the founders of the town. The family has written that it <b>understands</b> <b>this</b> last detail authenticates Daniel's own voice and demonstrates his willingness to claim his identity. Judea Pearl has written that at first this statement surprised him, but he later understood it to be a reference to the town-building tradition of his family contrasted with the destructive aims of his captors. Judea Pearl then enlarged the idea by inviting responses from artists, government leaders, authors, journalists, scientists, scholars, rabbis, and others. All wrote personal responses to what they thought upon hearing that these were Pearl's last words. Some responses were one sentence while others were several pages.|$|E
2500|$|Because of {{the huge}} {{interest}} in the Confucius family tree, there was a project in China to test the DNA of known {{family members of the}} collateral branches in mainland China. Among other things, this would allow scientists to identify a common Y chromosome in male descendants of Confucius. If the descent were truly unbroken, father-to-son, since Confucius's lifetime, the males in the family would all have the same Y chromosome as their direct male ancestor, with slight mutations due to the passage of time. The aim of the genetic test was the help members of collateral branches in China who lost their genealogical records to prove their descent. However, in 2009, many of the collateral branches decided not to agree to DNA testing. Bryan Sykes, professor of genetics at Oxford University, <b>understands</b> <b>this</b> decision: [...] "The Confucius family tree has an enormous cultural significance," [...] he said. [...] "It's not just a scientific question." [...] The DNA testing was originally proposed to add new members, many of whose family record books were lost during 20th-century upheavals, to the Confucian family tree. The main branch of the family which fled to Taiwan was never involved in the proposed DNA test at all.|$|E
2500|$|Orthodox and Conservative Jews {{hold that}} the prophecy of Moses is {{held to be}} true; he is held to be the chief of all prophets, even of those who came before and after him. [...] This belief was {{expressed}} by Maimonides, who wrote that [...] "Moses was superior to all prophets, whether they preceded him or arose afterwards. [...] Moses attained the highest possible human level. [...] He perceived God to a degree surpassing every human that ever existed....God spoke to all other prophets through an intermediary. [...] Moses alone did not need this; [...] {{this is what the}} Torah means when God says [...] "Mouth to mouth, I will speak to him." [...] The great Jewish philosopher Philo <b>understands</b> <b>this</b> type of prophecy to be an extraordinarily high level of philosophical understanding, which had been reached by Moses and which enabled him to write the Torah through his own rational deduction of natural law. [...] Maimonides, in his Commentary to the Mishna (preface to chapter [...] "Chelek", Tractate Sanhedrin), and in his Mishneh Torah, (in the Laws of the foundations of the Torah, ch. 7), describes a similar concept of prophecy, since a voice that did not originate from a body cannot exist, the understanding of Moses was based on his lofty philosophical understandings.|$|E

2500|$|The American scholar Stuart Tave {{noted that}} a major theme of Austen's novel is propriety, as she both mocks those who cling {{outwardly}} to propriety, often in a self-righteous manner without understanding what it really means and praises those who really live up to it. Those who really understand propriety in Austen's novel take into account both the feelings of others and draw the appropriate conclusions. Tave argued that the play Lover's Vows is {{a test of the}} character's commitment to propriety. The priggish Mrs. Norris sees herself as the guardian of propriety and is trusted by Sir Thomas before he leaves for Antigua to uphold propriety, a task she fails at completely by letting Lover's Vows be put on. Edmund objects to the play, as he knows it violates propriety in some way, but he fails to make the point, as bases his objections in specific matters rather the universal one of propriety. Only Fanny <b>understands</b> <b>this</b> point as she knows that playing the characters will also impact on the amateur actors, but she is not strong enough to persuade the others of her viewpoint. As the rehearsals continued, Fanny could clearly see the sexual tension and attraction between Edmund and Mary as they play the part of the two lovers, which fills her with misery and jealousy. Tave wrote about Price and the play: [...] "Excluded from the gaiety and busy employment of others, alone, sad, insignificant, seeing Mrs. Grant promoted to consequence and honor because Mrs. Grant accepted the character she herself refused, Fanny is in some danger of envying her. What distinguishes Fanny here, and throughout, is that she is capable of thought and recovery, and in this instance, reflection brings better feelings, showing her that even if she could have received the greatest respect she would never have been easy. It would have been easier to join a scheme, which considering only her uncle, she must condemn altogether". Finally, Tave suggests that when Sir Thomas shuts down Lover's Vows, this demonstrates the hypocrisy and myopic character of Sir Thomas as he is content to destroy the set and props without considering just what had led his children into putting on Lover's Vows in the first place as he is only concerned with the external aspects of people, not what really drives them.|$|E
