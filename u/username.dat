5|$|Following its predecessors, Brawl uses {{a battle}} system {{unlike that of}} typical {{fighting}} games. Players can choose from a large selection of characters, each attempting to knock their opponents off the screen as they fight on various stages. The characters in Brawl include most of the same ones as the predecessors, such as the well-known Mario and Pikachu. Instead of using traditional health bars that start at a maximum value and lose value, Brawl characters start the game with 0%; the value rises as they take damage and may rise over 100% {{to a maximum of}} 999%. As a character's percentage increases, the character flies further back when hit. When a character is knocked beyond a stage's boundary and disappears from the screen, the character loses either a life, a point, or coins, depending on the mode of play. Brawl includes a function which allows players to create profiles with personalized button configurations for each control method along with their chosen <b>username.</b>|$|E

40|$|The Internet {{represents}} an abundant source material for linguistic research, {{which continues to}} pose new challenges and opportunities on how language is used by its speakers. Its personal naming system, for example, has remained largely unexplored. Of the many facets of names on the Internet awaiting closer scrutiny, the phenomenon of <b>usernames</b> {{is perhaps the most}} fundamental. This thesis investigates the role they play in online life, the most suitable methods to approach them, and how they compare with the names used offline and where their place is in onomastics in general. With people’s names inevitably connected with one or another aspect of identity, this work focuses on the relationship between <b>usernames</b> and online identities. The data has been gathered from a forum on the Russian-speaking sector of the Internet (RuNet) and comprises all registered <b>usernames</b> (676 at the time of collection) as well as an extensive and methodically selected sample of users’ conversations. As a general analytical framework, it utilises Garfinkel’s (1967) ethnomethodology, which conceptualises identity {{as a result of the}} ongoing interaction that people negotiate and achieve in everyday life rather than a set of inherent inner qualities. More specifically, the following methodological tools devised by Sacks (e. g. 1995, 1984 a, 1984 b) have been used to perform the analysis: Membership Categorisation Analysis (MCA) to categorise the <b>usernames</b> of the forum participants, and Conversation Analysis (CA), to observe how <b>usernames</b> contribute to the construction of individual identities. Finally, the concept of Stance, as presented by Du Bois (2007), has been used as a lens to identify relevant evidence in the conversation samples. The analysis has demonstrated the need for a systematic categorisation of <b>usernames.</b> The way in which they associate sets of attributes, facilitates the allocation of named entities as members of certain categories of persons. Both linguistic and typographic elements of <b>usernames</b> contribute to how they are perceived and what impression they create. It is also argued that <b>usernames</b> have an important role to play in the active and ongoing construction of individual identities. The study concludes that CMC participants operate their <b>usernames</b> as meaningful linguistic devices to construct and co-construct each other’s identities. CA and MCD are confirmed to be relevant methods to analyse onomastic data. This study has generated a reliable body of evidence for the assertion that <b>usernames</b> are far from meaningless, and demonstrates, moreover, how their meanings are established. In so doing, it constitutes an important contribution to onomastic theory with the potential to shed new light on personal naming in general...|$|R

25|$|Digest access {{authentication}} {{is one of}} the agreed-upon methods a {{web server}} can use to negotiate credentials, such as <b>username</b> or password, with a user's web browser.

It applies a hash function to the <b>username</b> and password before sending them over the network. In contrast, basic access authentication uses the easily reversible Base64 encoding instead of hash digest, making it non-secure unless used in conjunction with TLS.|$|E

40|$|M. A. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2015. Includes bibliographical references. The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to examine players’ use of impression management strategies in different online video games. Specifically, players’ goals to create avatars and <b>usernames</b> that demonstrated physical attractiveness, likeability, and skill were measured for social and competitive games. Similarity with their avatar and avatar creation time were also measured for players who were and were not anticipating future interactions. Impression management provided the primary theoretical framework for this study. Participants reported to the lab to create avatars and <b>usernames</b> for an online video game, and then completed a questionnaire. Results indicated that social game players created avatars and <b>usernames</b> that were designed to appear more likeable than competitive game players. Competitive game players created avatars that were designed to appear more skillful than avatars created for social games, but <b>usernames</b> did not demonstrate the same difference for game type. No significant differences for avatars and <b>usernames</b> were found for game type on the design goal of physical attractiveness. Additionally, the data showed no significant differences for future type on similarity with avatar or avatar creation time. Results indicate support for impression management theory in the applied context of online video games...|$|R
