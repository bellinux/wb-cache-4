5|$|In {{the early}} part of 352 BC several key events had {{occurred}} in, or around Thrace which challenged Philip's influence in the region. The Athenian general Chares captured Sestos, on the Thracian Chersonese early in the year, probably taking the city from Kersebleptes. The Athenians had a long-standing interest in the Chersonese for strategic reasons, and it had formed a significant part of their 'Empire' in the 5th century BC. Firstly, Athens depended largely on the import of grain from the Crimea for her food supply; controlling the Chersonese helped to ensure that supplies could safely pass through the Hellespont. Secondly, the Chersonese was used as a place to settle the excess citizenry of Athens, usually in the form of cleruchies, colonies which were not politically independent of the mother city. After the capture of Sestos, Kersebleptes, who <b>up</b> <b>until</b> <b>now</b> had resisted Athenian attempts to reclaim the Chersonese, now came to terms with Athens. He was probably now worried about Philip's influence in the region, and thus sought to ally with the Athenians, giving them control of all the cities of the Chersonese except Cardia. Furthermore, the Chalkidian League also seems to have turned against Philip in 352 BC, presumably also concerned by his designs on their territory, and sought peace with Athens.|$|E

There was also a very strong process of Slovakization of Polish people throughout 18th–20th centuries, mostly done by Roman Catholic Church, in which institution the local aboriginal Polish priests were replaced with Slovak ones.

500|$|The {{first time}} Karofsky {{received}} significant notice from critics {{was for the}} second season's sixth episode, [...] "Never Been Kissed". Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times commented that it was testament to the writers and cast that Karofsky's kiss startled the audience {{as much as it}} did Kurt, and commended the transitioning of Karofsky from a faceless jock into [...] "a nuanced character with a back story and hidden motives of his own." [...] MTV's Aly Semigran wrote that, should the episode inspire a single teenager to have courage in the face of discrimination, or re-consider bullying, it would be an impressive accomplishment. Linda Holmes of National Public Radio dismissed [...] "Never Been Kissed" [...] as [...] "one of the most facile and emotionally inauthentic episodes the show has ever produced", and felt that Karofsky's swift transition from bullying to kissing Kurt was absurd and [...] "emotionally unsound". His appearances over the next few episodes drew only oblique commentary, such as The Atlantic Kevin Fallon's characterization in his review on [...] "Furt" [...] of the bullying storyline as a [...] "very important arc that's been well-acted by all parties involved". In [...] "The Sue Sylvester Shuffle", The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff wrote, [...] "I thought giving Kurt's bully, Karofsky (...), a miniature story arc that resolved itself only partially was a smart move. <b>Up</b> <b>until</b> <b>now,</b> he's been kind of a walking cliché, and now he gets to be someone who's not all repressed sexuality and monstrous tendencies."
