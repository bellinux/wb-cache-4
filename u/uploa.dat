40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{the existence of}} localized oscillatory breathers for quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates confined in periodic potentials. The breathing behavior corresponds to position-oscillations of individual condensates about the minima of the potential lattice. We deduce the structural stability of the localized oscillations from the construction. The stability is confirmed numerically for perturbations to the initial state of the condensate, to the potential trap, {{as well as for}} external noise. We also construct periodic and chaotic extended oscillations for the chain of condensates. All our findings are verified by direct numerical integration of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in one dimension.

40|$|Abstract—This paper covers {{various aspects}} of the Internet film piracy. In order to {{successfully}} deal with this matter, it is needed to recognize and explain various motivational factors related to film piracy. Thus, this study proposes groups of economical, sociopsychological and other factors that could motivate individuals to engage in pirate activities. The paper also studies the interactions between downloaders and uploaders and offers the causality of the motivational factors and its effects on the film industry. Moreover, the study also focuses on proposed scheme of relations of downloading movies and the possible effect on box office revenues. T Keywords—Download, Film piracy, Internet, <b>Uploa...</b>|$|E
40|$|We perform, as a {{function}} of uniaxial stress, an optical-reflectivity investigation of the representative 'parent' ferropnictide BaFe$_ 2 $As$_ 2 $ in a broad spectral range, across the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic phase transition and the onset of the long-range antiferromagnetic order (AFM). The infrared response reveals that the $dc$ transport anisotropy in the orthorhombic AFM state is determined by the interplay between the Drude spectral weight and the scattering rate, but that the dominant effect is clearly associated with the metallic spectral weight. In the paramagnetic tetragonal phase, though, the $dc$ resistivity anisotropy of strained samples is almost exclusively due to stress-induced changes in the Drude weight rather than in the scattering rate, definitively establishing the anisotropy of the Fermi surface parameters as the primary effect driving the $dc$ transport properties in the electronic nematic state.

40|$|We {{show that}} all cosmological models with an {{accelerated}} stationary global attractor reduce asymptotically {{to a dark}} energy field with an exponential potential coupled linearly to a perfect fluid dark matter. In such models the abundance of the dark components reaches a stationary value and therefore the problem of their present coincidence is solved. The requirement of a vanishing coupling of the baryons in order to pass local gravity experiments induces {{the existence of an}} intermediate baryon-dominated era. We discuss in detail the properties of these models and show that to accomodate standard nucleosynthesis they cannot produce a microwave background consistent with observations. We conclude that, among stationary models, only a time-dependent coupling or equation of state might provide a realistic cosmology. Comment: 7 pages, submitted to Phys.

40|$|A quantum antidot, a {{submicron}} depletion {{region in}} a two-dimensional electron system, has been actively {{studied in the}} past two decades, providing a powerful tool for understanding quantum Hall systems. In a perpendicular magnetic field, electrons form bound states around the antidot. Aharonov-Bohm resonances through such bound states have been experimentally studied, showing interesting phenomena such as Coulomb charging, h/ 2 e oscillations, spectator modes, signatures of electron interactions in the line shape, Kondo effect, etc. None of them can be explained by a simple noninteracting electron approach. Theoretical models for the above observations have been developed recently, such as a capacitive-interaction model for explaining the h/ 2 e oscillations and the Kondo effect, numerical prediction of a hole maximum-density-droplet antidot ground state, and spin density-functional theory for investigating the compressibility of antidot edges. In this review, we summarize such experimental and theoretical works on electron interactions in antidots. Comment: 73 pages, 28 figures, to be published in Physics Reports.

40|$|Correlation {{functions}} {{measured as}} a function of Δη, Δϕ have emerged as a powerful tool to study the dynamics of particle production in nuclear collisions at high energy. They are however subject, like any other observables, to instrumental effects which must be properly accounted for to extract meaningful physics results. We compare the merits of several techniques used towards measurement of these correlation functions in nuclear collisions. We discuss and distinguish the effects of finite acceptance, and detection efficiency that may vary with collision parameters such as the position of the event in the detector and the instantaneous luminosity of the beam. We focus in particular on instrumental effects which break the factorization of the particle pair detection efficiency, and describe a technique to recover the robustness of correlation observables. We finally introduce a multi-dimensional weight method to correct for efficiencies that vary simultaneously with particle pseudo rapidity, azimuthal angle, transverse momentum, and the collision vertex position. The method can be generalized to account for any number of "event variables" that may break the factorability of the pair efficiency. Comment: 19 pages, 12 figures, Corrected various tempos.

40|$|A major {{obstacle}} to understanding neural coding and computation {{is the fact that}} experimental recordings typically sample {{only a small fraction of}} the neurons in a circuit. Measured neural properties are skewed by interactions between recorded neurons and the "hidden" portion of the network. To properly interpret neural data and determine how biological structure gives rise to neural circuit function, we thus need a better understanding of the relationships between measured effective neural properties and the true underlying physiological properties. Here, we focus on how the effective spatiotemporal dynamics of the synaptic interactions between neurons are reshaped by coupling to unobserved neurons. We find that the effective interactions from a pre-synaptic neuron r' to a post-synaptic neuron r can be decomposed into a sum of the true interaction from r' to r plus corrections from every directed path from r' to r through unobserved neurons. Importantly, the resulting formula reveals when the hidden units have [...] -or do not have [...] -major effects on reshaping the interactions among observed neurons. As a particular example of interest, we derive a formula for the impact of hidden units in random networks with "strong" coupling [...] -connection weights that scale with 1 /√(N), where N is the network size, precisely the scaling observed in recent experiments. With this quantitative relationship between measured and true interactions, we can study how network properties shape effective interactions, which properties are relevant for neural computations, and how to manipulate effective interactions.

40|$|Tavenas has {{recently}} proved that any n^O(1) -variate and degree n polynomial in VP can be computed by a depth- 4 circuit of size 2 ^O(√(n) n). So to prove VP not equal to VNP, it {{is sufficient to}} show that an explicit polynomial in VNP of degree n requires 2 ^ω(√(n) n) size depth- 4 circuits. Soon after Tavenas's result, for two different explicit polynomials, depth- 4 circuit size lower bounds of 2 ^Ω(√(n) n) have been proved Kayal et al. and Fournier et al. In particular, using combinatorial design Kayal et al. construct an explicit polynomial in VNP that requires depth- 4 circuits of size 2 ^Ω(√(n) n) and Fournier et al. show that iterated matrix multiplication polynomial (which is in VP) also requires 2 ^Ω(√(n) n) size depth- 4 circuits. In this paper, we identify a simple combinatorial property such that any polynomial f that satisfies the property would achieve similar circuit size lower bound for depth- 4 circuits. In particular, {{it does not matter}} whether f is in VP or in VNP. As a result, we get a very simple unified lower bound analysis for the above mentioned polynomials. Another goal {{of this paper is to}} compare between our current knowledge of depth- 4 circuit size lower bounds and determinantal complexity lower bounds. We prove the that the determinantal complexity of iterated matrix multiplication polynomial is Ω(dn) where d is the number of matrices and n is the dimension of the matrices. So for d=n, we get that the iterated matrix multiplication polynomial achieves the current best known lower bounds in both fronts: depth- 4 circuit size and determinantal complexity. To the best of our knowledge, a Θ(n) bound for the determinantal complexity for the iterated matrix multiplication polynomial was known only for constant d> 1 by Jansen.
