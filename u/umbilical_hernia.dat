5|$|Newborn {{children}} with hypothyroidism may have normal birth weight and height (although the head may {{be larger than}} expected and the posterior fontanelle may be open). Some may have drowsiness, decreased muscle tone, a hoarse-sounding cry, feeding difficulties, constipation, an enlarged tongue, <b>umbilical</b> <b>hernia,</b> dry skin, a decreased body temperature and jaundice. A goiter is rare, although it may develop later in children who have a thyroid gland that does not produce functioning thyroid hormone. A goiter may also develop in children growing up in areas with iodine deficiency. Normal growth and development may be delayed, and not treating infants may lead to an intellectual impairment (IQ 6–15 points lower in severe cases). Other problems include the following: large scale and fine motor skills and coordination, reduced muscle tone, squinting, decreased attention span, and delayed speaking. Tooth eruption may be delayed.|$|E
5|$|Being a brachycephalic breed, King Charles Spaniels can be {{sensitive}} to anesthesia. This is because in brachycephalic dogs, there is additional tissue in the throat directly behind the mouth and nasal cavity, known as the pharynx, and anesthesia acts as a muscle relaxant causing this tissue to obstruct the dogs' narrow airways. These narrow airways can decrease the dogs' ability to exercise properly and increase their susceptibility to heat stroke. Other congenital and hereditary disorders found in the King Charles Spaniel are hanging tongue, where a neurological defect prevents the tongue from retracting into the mouth; diabetes mellitus, which {{may be associated with}} cataracts; cleft palate and <b>umbilical</b> <b>hernia.</b> The English Toy Spaniel Club of America recommends that umbilical hernias be corrected only if other surgery is required, due to the risk of surgery in brachycephalic breeds. In another study conducted by the OFA, the King Charles Spaniel was the 38th worst of 99 breeds for patella luxation; of 75 animals tested, 4% were found to have the ailment. However, surveys conducted by the Finnish breed club between 1988 and 2007 found that the occurrences were higher in some years, ranging from 5.3% to 50%.|$|E
25|$|MPS I H-S, Hurler–Scheie {{syndrome}}, is {{less severe}} than Hurler syndrome alone. Symptoms generally begin between ages 3 and 8. Children may have moderate intellectual disability and learning difficulties. Skeletal and systemic irregularities include short stature, marked smallness in the jaws, progressive joint stiffness, compressed spinal cord, clouded corneas, hearing loss, heart disease, coarse facial features, and <b>umbilical</b> <b>hernia.</b> Respiratory problems, sleep apnea, {{and heart disease}} may develop in adolescence. Some persons with MPS I H-S need continuous positive airway pressure during sleep to ease breathing. Life expectancy is generally into the late teens or early twenties.|$|E

Furthermore, it can be attached to the umbilical region by the vitelline ligament, with the possibility of vitelline cysts, or even a patent vitelline canal forming a vitelline fistula when the umbilical cord is cut.

Rarely, the hernia will only involve part of the intestinal wall (termed a Richter's hernia), which can lead to an enterocutaneous fistula. Strangulating <b>umbilical</b> <b>hernias</b> will present as enlarged, firm, warm, and painful with colic signs. Foals usually survive to discharge.|$|R

Ten 2 - to 3 -month-old gilts (Large White × Italian Landrace) with <b>umbilical</b> <b>hernias</b> were heavily sedated and placed in dorsal recumbency. After manual reduction of the hernia in each animal, two Elastrator rings were applied on the hernial sac, close to the abdominal wall. Animals showed no signs of post-treatment pain. In eight animals, the hernial sac separated at 21 to 28 days post treatment. These animals were marketed at a mean age of 220. 5 ± 8. 25 days and an average weight of 171 ± 7 kg. Repair was unsuccessful in two animals. The use of Elastrator rings to repair recently diagnosed <b>umbilical</b> <b>hernias</b> appears to be an effective method in commercial swine. The technique is simple and inexpensive, and animals need no special care...|$|R
