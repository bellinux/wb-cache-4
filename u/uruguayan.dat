5|$|About 18 percent (40,000) of the <b>Uruguayan</b> {{population}} (220,000) spoke Portuguese {{and regarded}} themselves as Brazilian rather than <b>Uruguayan.</b> Many within Flores' ranks were Brazilians, some hailing {{from the nearby}} Brazilian province of Rio Grande do Sul. Life along the frontier between Rio Grande do Sul and Uruguay was often chaotic, with hostilities erupting between partisans of various cattle barons, cattle-rustling and random killings. Large landowners {{on both sides of}} the border had long been antagonistic toward Berro's policies. The <b>Uruguayan</b> president attempted to tax the cattle coming from Rio Grande do Sul and to impose curbs on the use of Brazilian slaves within <b>Uruguayan</b> territory; slavery had been outlawed years before in Uruguay.|$|E
5|$|Another {{civil war}} {{had begun in}} Uruguay which pitted its {{political}} parties against one another. The internal conflict led {{to the murder of}} Brazilians and the looting of their <b>Uruguayan</b> properties. Brazil's Progressive Cabinet decided to intervene and dispatched an army, which invaded Uruguay in December 1864, beginning the brief <b>Uruguayan</b> War.|$|E

5|$|As {{war with}} the British Empire loomed, Brazil had to turn its {{attention}} to its southern frontiers. Another civil war had begun in Uruguay which pitted its political parties against one another. The internal conflict led {{to the murder of}} Brazilians and the looting of their <b>Uruguayan</b> properties. Brazil's progressive cabinet decided to intervene and dispatched an army, which invaded Uruguay in December 1864, beginning the brief <b>Uruguayan</b> War. The dictator of nearby Paraguay, Francisco Solano López, took advantage of the <b>Uruguayan</b> situation in late 1864 by attempting to establish his nation as a regional power. In November of that year, he ordered a Brazilian civilian steamship seized, triggering the Paraguayan War, and then invaded Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{construction}} delays at Estadio Centenario, Uruguay's first match was not played until five {{days into the}} tournament. The first {{to be held at}} the Centenario, it was preceded by a ceremony in honour of the <b>Uruguayan</b> centenary celebrations. The <b>Uruguayan</b> team spent the four weeks preceding the match in a training camp, at which strict discipline was exercised. Goalkeeper Andrés Mazali was dropped from the squad for breaking a curfew to visit his wife. One hundred years to the day of the creation of Uruguay's first constitution, the hosts won a tight match against Peru 1–0. Spectators praised Peru's defense, and {{this turned out to be}} the only tournament match in which Uruguay scored only one goal. The result was viewed as a poor performance by the <b>Uruguayan</b> press, but lauded in Peru. Uruguay subsequently defeated Romania with ease, scoring four first half goals to win 4–0.|$|E
50|$|<b>Uruguayans</b> share a Spanish {{linguistic}} and cultural background with its neighbour country Argentina. Also, like Argentinians, most <b>Uruguayans</b> descend from colonial-era settlers and immigrants from Europe with almost 90% {{of the population}} being of European descent.|$|R

5|$|Brazil's {{involvement}} in the <b>Uruguayan</b> civil war also began to deepen. Luis Alves de Lima e Silva, the Count of Caxias, assumed the presidency (governorship) of Rio Grande do Sul and the command of the four Brazilian Army divisions headquartered in the province. Beginning in 1849, the Imperial government directly assisted the besieged <b>Uruguayan</b> government of Colorados in Montevideo, and on 6 September 1850 the <b>Uruguayan</b> representative Andres Lamas {{signed an agreement with}} Irineu Evangelista de Sousa to transfer money to the Montevideo government through his bank. On 16 March 1851, the Empire of Brazil openly declared its support of Colorado government of Uruguay against Oribe, something it had been covertly doing for more than two years. This did not please the Argentine government, and it began mobilizing for war.|$|E
5|$|The fusionism {{movement}} collapsed as the Colorados {{abandoned the}} coalition to join Flores' ranks. The <b>Uruguayan</b> Civil War quickly escalated, developing into {{a crisis of}} international scope that destabilized the entire region. Even before the Colorado rebellion, the Blancos within fusionism had sought an alliance with Paraguayan dictator Francisco Solano López. Berro's now purely Blanco government also received support from Argentine federalists, who opposed Mitre and his Unitarians. The situation deteriorated as the Empire of Brazil was drawn into the conflict. Almost one fifth of the <b>Uruguayan</b> population were considered Brazilian. Some joined Flores' rebellion, spurred by discontent with Blanco government policies that they regarded as harmful to their interests. Brazil eventually decided {{to intervene in the}} <b>Uruguayan</b> affair to reestablish the security of its southern frontiers and its regional ascendancy.|$|E
5|$|A set {{of events}} {{similar to those}} that doomed Star Dust also caused the crash of <b>Uruguayan</b> Air Force Flight 571 in 1972 (depicted in the film Alive), though there were {{survivors}} from that crash because it involved a glancing blow to a mountainside rather than a head-on collision.|$|E

5|$|In 1906, while {{cruising}} in North American waters, Dogali {{stopped at}} the Pensacola Navy Yard, where she had some maintenance done on her engines. Later that year she was present for a ceremony in Capitán Pastene, Chile, a town founded by Italian immigrants. In January 1908, the Italian government sold Dogali to Uruguay. She was renamed 25 de Agosto for the date Uruguay declared its independence. At the time, she was the largest warship in the <b>Uruguayan</b> Navy. In 1910, the ship was renamed Montevideo after the country's capital city. She was decommissioned in 1914, but remained in the <b>Uruguayan</b> Navy's inventory until 1932, when the old cruiser was finally sold to be broken up.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Uruguayan</b> War (10 August 1864– 20 February 1865) {{was fought}} between Uruguay's {{governing}} Blanco Party and an alliance {{consisting of the}} Empire of Brazil and the <b>Uruguayan</b> Colorado Party, covertly supported by Argentina. Since its independence, Uruguay had been ravaged by intermittent struggles between the Colorado and Blanco factions, each attempting to seize and maintain power in turn. The Colorado leader Venancio Flores launched the Liberating Crusade in 1863, an insurrection aimed at toppling Bernardo Berro, who presided over a Colorado–Blanco coalition (fusionist) government. Flores was aided by Argentina, whose president Bartolomé Mitre provided him with supplies, Argentine volunteers and river transport for troops.|$|E

5|$|What {{had seemed}} a simple {{military}} intervention of short duration {{led to a}} full-scale war in South America's southeast. The Progressive Cabinet named Paranhos plenipotentiary minister. His mission was to end the conflict with Uruguay so that Brazil could focus on the far more serious threat posed by Paraguay. He arrived in the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires, on 2 December 1864. Paranhos signed a peace treaty with the <b>Uruguayan</b> government on 20 February 1865, ending the war. Paranhos not only managed to bring about peace, but he concurrently forged an alliance between Brazil, Argentina and the <b>Uruguayan</b> rebels (who formed Uruguay's postwar government) against Paraguay. The pact would later be officially signed as the Treaty of the Triple Alliance.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they were}} still allies, San Martín began to {{distance}} himself from Alvear, who controlled the Assembly and the lodge. Alvear opposed the merchants and the <b>Uruguayan</b> caudillo José Gervasio Artigas, San Martín thought that it was risky to open such conflicts when the royalists were still a threat. The Army of the North, which was operating at the Upper Peru, was defeated at the battles of Vilcapugio and Ayohuma, so the triumvirate appointed San Martín to head it, replacing Manuel Belgrano.|$|E
