50|$|As with Lepidium campestre, <b>Virginia</b> <b>pepperweed's</b> most {{identifiable}} characteristic is its raceme, {{which comes}} from the plant's highly branched stem. The racemes give <b>Virginia</b> <b>pepperweed</b> {{the appearance of a}} bottlebrush. On the racemes are first small white flowers, and later greenish fruits. The entire plant is generally between 10 and 50 centimeters tall.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Virginia</b> <b>pepperweed</b> grows as a weed in most {{crops and}} {{is found in}} roadsides, landscapes and waste areas. It prefers sunny locales with dry soil.|$|R
50|$|The {{leaves on}} the stems of <b>Virginia</b> <b>pepperweed</b> are sessile, linear to {{lanceolate}} and get larger as they approach the base. Note that {{all parts of the}} plant have a peppery taste.|$|R
50|$|Amphibulima patula dominicensis is {{frequently}} found on banana and Citrus plants, {{where it may}} feed on the leaves. They also eat leaves of <b>Virginia</b> <b>pepperweed</b> Lepidium virginicum and Cakile lanceolata. They eat lettuce in captivity.|$|R
50|$|Lepidium virginicum, {{also known}} as least pepperwort, <b>Virginia</b> <b>pepperweed</b> or peppergrass, is an annual or {{biennial}} plant in the Brassicaceae or mustard family. It is native to much of North America, including most of the United States and Mexico and southern regions of Canada, {{as well as most}} of Central America. It can be found elsewhere as an introduced species.|$|R

40|$|In {{addition}} to their direct effects on crop production through competition and allelopathy, weeds can serve as reservoirs of other pests including plant-parasitic nematodes, resulting indirectly in yield loss. Weeds enable plant-parasitic nematodes {{to survive in the}} absence or even presence of the crop, thus providing a source of nematode infection for the following season. The {{purpose of this study was}} to conduct a survey of common weeds and associated plant-parasitic nematodes at four agricultural sites, thereby demonstrating the importance of weeds as reservoirs of these pests. Two organic farms and two conventional farming systems were visited. Soil samples were taken from the root zones of predominant weed species at each site, and nematodes were extracted, identified, and counted. Purple nutsedge (Cyperus rotundus L.), pigweed (Amaranthus spp.), lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.), and crabgrass (Digitaria spp.) were the weeds most frequently encountered. Root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) were the major plant-parasitic nematodes frequently found in association with these weeds in relatively high numbers. A greenhouse experiment confirmed the susceptibility of American black nightshade (Solanum American Mill.), yellow nutsedge (Cyperus esculentus L.), purple nutsedge (C. rotundus L., Florida pusley (Richardia scabra L.), and bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.) to M. incognita, but <b>Virginia</b> <b>pepperweed</b> (Lepidium virginicum L.) was relatively resistant to this nematode. The implications of these results and importance of weeds as hosts for plant-parasitic nematodes are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{other states}} in the <b>U.S.,</b> <b>Virginia</b> draws a sharp {{distinction}} between cities and counties.
