There is also a Shoutbox for public messages. Profile pages are visible to all, together {{with a list of}} top artists and tracks, and the 10 most recently played tracks (can be expanded). Each user's profile has a 'Taste-o-Meter' which gives a rating of how compatible your music taste is.|$|E
25|$|PGPencryption uses {{a serial}} {{combination}} of hashing, data compression, symmetric-key cryptography, and finally public-key cryptography; each step uses {{one of several}} supported algorithms. Each public key is bound to a <b>user</b> <b>name</b> or an e-mail address. The first version of this system was generally known as a web of trust to contrast with the X.509 system, which uses a hierarchical approach based on certificate authority and which was added to PGP implementations later. Current versions of PGP encryption include both options through an automated key management server.|$|E

25|$|In Windows 2000, XP or later, the user's RSA {{private key}} is {{encrypted}} using a hash of the user's NTLM password hash plus the <b>user</b> <b>name</b> â€“ {{use of a}} salted hash makes it extremely difficult to reverse the process and recover the private key without knowing the user's passphrase. Also, again, setting Syskey to mode 2 or 3 (Syskey typed in during bootup or stored on a floppy disk) will mitigate this attack, since the local user's password hash will be stored encrypted in the SAM file.|$|E
25|$|Both when {{encrypting}} {{messages and}} when verifying signatures, {{it is critical}} that the public key used to send messages to someone or some entity actually does 'belong' to the intended recipient. Simply downloading a public key from somewhere is not an overwhelming assurance of that association; deliberate (or accidental) impersonation is possible. From its first version, PGP has always included provisions for distributing user's public keys in an 'identity certificate', which is also constructed cryptographically so that any tampering (or accidental garble) is readily detectable. However, merely making a certificate which is impossible to modify without being detected is insufficient; this can prevent corruption only after the certificate has been created, not before. Users must also ensure by some means that the public key in a certificate actually does belong to the person or entity claiming it. From its first release, PGP products have included an internal certificate 'vetting scheme' to assist with this, a trust model which has been called a web of trust. A given public key (or more specifically, information binding a <b>user</b> <b>name</b> to a key) may be digitally signed by a third party user to attest to the association between someone (actually a <b>user</b> <b>name)</b> and the key. There are several levels of confidence which can be included in such signatures. Although many programs read and write this information, few (if any) include this level of certification when calculating whether to trust a key.|$|E
25|$|On 11 June, reports {{emerged that}} LulzSec hacked into and stole user {{information}} from the pornography website www.pron.com. They obtained and published around 26,000 e-mail addresses and passwords. Among the information stolen were records of two users who subscribed using email addresses associated with the Malaysian government, three users who subscribed using United States military email addresses and 55 users who LulzSec claimed were administrators of other adult-oriented websites. Following the breach, Facebook locked the accounts of all users who had used the published e-mail addresses, and also blocked new Facebook accounts opened using the leaked e-mail addresses, fearing that users of the site would get hacked after LulzSec encouraged people to try and see if these people used identical <b>user</b> <b>name</b> and password combinations on Facebook as well.|$|E

25|$|Cookies do have {{benefits}} {{that many people}} may not know. One benefit is that for websites that one frequently visits that requires a password, cookies make it so {{they do not have}} to sign in every time. A cookie can also track one's preferences to show them websites that might interest them. Cookies make more websites free to use without any type of payment. Some of these benefits are also seen as negative. For example, one of the most common ways of theft is hackers taking one's <b>user</b> <b>name</b> and password that a cookie saves. While a lot of sites are free, they have to make a profit some how so they sell their space to advertisers. These ads, which are personalized to one's likes, can often freeze one's computer or cause annoyance. Cookies are mostly harmless except for third-party cookies. These cookies are not made by the website itself, but by web banner advertising companies. These third-party cookies are so dangerous because they take the same information that regular cookies do, such as browsing habits and frequently visited websites, but then they give out this information to other companies.|$|E

500|$|The blacklisting of Virgin Killer {{also caused}} other {{inadvertent}} issues for Wikipedia {{users in the}} United Kingdom. Usually most Internet users have a unique IP address visible to websites. However, {{as a result of}} ISPs using the IWF blacklist implemented through Cleanfeed technology, traffic to Wikipedia via those affected ISPs was then routed through a small number of proxy servers. This caused problems for users of the site. Since Wikipedia allows users to anonymously edit its encyclopaedia articles, these individuals are identified only through their IP addresses, which are used to selectively block users who vandalise the site or otherwise break its rules. The proxy filtering makes it impossible to uniquely distinguish users, and to prevent vandalism Wikipedia [...] "instituted a blanket ban on anonymous edits from the six ISPs, which account for 95% of British residential internet users". This had the immediate effect of requiring nearly all registered users in the UK to request the lifting of [...] on their accounts before they could edit again, and the de facto permanent effect of barring any contribution from people without , who contribute merely under an IP address and not a <b>user</b> <b>name.</b>|$|E
500|$|Nominations {{must be made}} on the CoSIDA website by {{a current}} dues-paying member with a CoSIDA-issued <b>user</b> <b>name</b> and {{password}} for the academic year at issue. [...] Formerly, nominations were made by pen and ink and then with typewritten nominations. [...] The CoSIDA members nominate student-athletes only from the academic institution that they are affiliated with. [...] The nominees must be a starter or important reserve with at least a 3.30 cumulative grade point average (on a 4.0 scale) at his/her current institution. Nominees must have participated in at least 50 percent of the teamâ€™s games at the position listed on the nomination form (where applicable). In baseball and softball, pitchers must have at least 10.0 innings pitched. Nominees are ineligible until the completion of one full calendar year at his/her current institution and attainment of sophomore athletic eligibility. Transfers, graduate students and two-year college graduates must have completed one full calendar year at the nominating institution to be eligible. Graduate school nominees must have a cumulative GPA of 3.30 or better both as an undergraduate and in graduate school. Except for at-large program, there are no limits in the number of athletes an institution may nominate. In the at-large program, nominations are limited to three per school per gender (a total of three men's at-large candidates and three women's at-large candidates). If an institution participates in both the college and the university divisions, it may nominate a total of three men and three women between the two divisions.|$|E

2500|$|The {{operating}} {{system must be}} capable of distinguishing between requests which {{should be allowed to}} be processed, and others which should not be processed. While some systems may simply distinguish between [...] "privileged" [...] and [...] "non-privileged", systems commonly have a form of requester identity, such as a <b>user</b> <b>name.</b> To establish identity there may be a process of authentication. Often a username must be quoted, and each username may have a password. Other methods of authentication, such as magnetic cards or biometric data, might be used instead. In some cases, especially connections from the network, resources may be accessed with no authentication at all (such as reading files over a network share). Also covered by the concept of requester identity is authorization; the particular services and resources accessible by the requester once logged into a system are tied to either the requester's user account or to the variously configured groups of users to which the requester belongs.|$|E
