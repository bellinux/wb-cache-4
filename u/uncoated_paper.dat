50|$|Paper at {{this point}} is <b>uncoated.</b> Coated <b>paper</b> has a thin layer of {{material}} such as calcium carbonate or china clay applied to one or both sides {{in order to create a}} surface more suitable for high-resolution halftone screens. (<b>Uncoated</b> <b>papers</b> are rarely suitable for screens above 150 lpi.) Coated or <b>uncoated</b> <b>papers</b> may have their surfaces polished by calendering. Coated papers are divided into matte, semi-matte or silk, and gloss. Gloss papers give the highest optical density in the printed image.|$|R

40|$|Print {{quality is}} very {{important}} for every printing technique. It depends on many different quality attributes. This research included analysis of macro non-uniformities and line reproduction. 16 different paper substrates printed by electrophotographic process were analyzed. They were separated in two groups: coated and <b>uncoated</b> <b>papers.</b> Analysis of macro non-uniformity showed that print mottle has lower values when printed on coated <b>papers</b> than on <b>uncoated</b> <b>papers.</b> Line reproduction analysis showed that the toner spreaded, during melting and fixation, on line edges for both types of paper. According to these results it can be concluded that paper substrate affects the macro non-uniformity and line reproduction, thus overall print quality...|$|R

50|$|The {{measure of}} how much an ink dot spreads and becomes larger on paper is called dot gain. This {{phenomenon}} must be accounted for in photographic or digital preparation of screened images. Dot gain is higher on more absorbent, <b>uncoated</b> <b>paper</b> stock such as newsprint.|$|E

The paper presents research into methods for mixing and printing colours using the latest multi-primary inkjet printing system.

40|$|There have {{in recent}} years been {{improvements}} {{in the quality of}} print achieved using large format inkjet printers with stable pigmented ink sets on fine art inkjet papers coated with an ink receptive layer. Increasingly professional photographers, graphic artists, printmakers and artists from all disciplines are using inkjet technology to produce prints. Existing <b>uncoated</b> fine art <b>papers</b> can also offer a rich variety of substrates for inkjet printing. An identified problem is the colour variation between prints produced on coated and <b>uncoated</b> <b>papers.</b> This however can be remedied through correct linearisation and profiling. Colour management using ICC profiles is a very useful method {{to improve the quality of}} digital inkjet printing. The Centre for Fine Print Research, UWE and John Purcell Paper have undertaken research into digital printing on coated and fine art papers. The aim of the research was to develop a series of standard and bespoke ICC profile for a range of specialist coated and <b>uncoated</b> fine art <b>papers,</b> inks and printers. This paper focused on methods for the creation of profiles and an evaluation of both coated and <b>uncoated</b> fine art <b>paper.</b> A number of fine art papers with various weights and surfaces including 42 gsm Japanese paper, 300 gsm Somerset, 100...|$|R

50|$|Bible paper, {{also known}} as scritta paper, is a thin grade of paper used for {{printing}} books which have {{a large number of}} pages, such as a bible. Technically it is called lightweight offset paper and is a type of woodfree <b>uncoated</b> <b>paper.</b> This paper grade often contains cotton or linen fibres to increase its strength in spite of its thinness.|$|E
50|$|Woodfree <b>{{uncoated}}</b> <b>paper</b> (WFU) or uncoated fine {{papers are}} manufactured using wood {{that has been}} processed into a chemical pulp that removes the lignin from the wood fibers and may also contain 5-25% fillers. Both softwood and hardwood chemical pulps are used and a minor part of mechanical pulp might be added (often of aspen or poplar). These paper grades are calendered.|$|E
50|$|The outer {{covering}} {{can be in}} {{a variety}} of colors with or without printing. Plain paper, metallic paper, plastic, poly, or custom. coatings are popular for different applications. The plastic, poly, or metallic paper twist ties withstand water better than the <b>uncoated</b> <b>paper</b> versions. Different sizes and strengths are used for different applications, from a small closure for a bag of bread to a large, heavy tie to hold unwieldy garden hoses in place. A twist tie with a broad paper covering may also be used for labeling.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} how inkjet colour {{is affected}} by firstly the substrate and secondly exposure to light and the combination of both. The research uses both pigmented and dye based inks printed onto coated and <b>uncoated</b> fine art <b>papers,</b> and are subjected to light conditions that are constantly changing through out the day and consequently the year. Although benchmark conditions and standards as issued by Wilhelm Imaging Research (1) are useful, once a printed artwork enters the public domain artworks may be subjected to conditions beyond expectations of the laboratory, such as changes in light, humidity and pollutants. Colour patches were printed onto a variety of artist’s coated and <b>uncoated</b> <b>papers</b> and then measured and photographed. The microphotography shows how ink sits within the fibres of the paper, and how colour and colour combinations changes over time...|$|R

50|$|Screen {{frequency}} {{is determined}} by the type of paper the image is printed on. An absorbent paper surface, uncoated recycled paper for instance, lets ink droplets spread (dot gain)—so requires a more open printing screen. Input resolution can therefore be reduced to minimize file size without loss in quality, as long as the quality factor of 2 is maintained. This is easily determined by doubling the line frequency. For example, printing on an <b>uncoated</b> <b>paper</b> stock often limits printing screen frequency to no more than 120 lpi, therefore, a quality factor of 2 is achieved with images of 240 ppi.|$|E

50|$|A {{major problem}} with soy ink {{is that it}} takes more time to dry than petroleum-based inks, due to its lack of {{evaporative}} solvents {{in the form of}} VOCs. This creates challenges for some printing presses, especially those that use coated papers (such as magazines) instead of porous, <b>uncoated</b> <b>paper</b> (such as newspapers) where the ink can dry via absorption or IR in-line heaters. Current studies into UV-reactive ink curing are being conducted by many ink producers, most prominently the Flint Group. This process dries much faster, is cheaper, uses less energy, and emits no VOCs. This requires a significant equipment change and has not been scaled down to consumer size as of 2006.|$|E
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of optical brightening agents (OBAs), {{also known as}} fluorescent whitening agents (FWAs), has long been {{of interest in the}} production of <b>uncoated</b> fine <b>paper,</b> particularly in <b>uncoated</b> fine <b>paper</b> grades containing high-yield pulp (HYP). The increasing levels of whiteness and also the increasing HYP substitution in fine papers has made OBA efficiency an important issue. This paper summarizes recent research findings in understanding and enhancing OBA efficiency in fine papers containing HYP, with focus on the main factors affecting OBA efficiency in both wet end and size press application. These factors include the base sheet brightness and whiteness of the pulp, UV competitors, OBA retention, quenching effects, and OBA migration at the size press. Some new technologies to improve OBA efficiency are discussed...|$|R
