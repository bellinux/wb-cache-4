50|$|The <b>ultramarine</b> <b>grosbeak</b> (Cyanocompsa brissonii) is {{a species}} of grosbeak in the Cardinalidae family. It is found {{in a wide range}} of semi-open {{habitats}} in eastern and central South America, with a disjunct population in northern South America.|$|E
50|$|The male {{resembles the}} male {{black-and-white}} tanager, but differs by its black flanks and its strikingly whitish-grey bill (this has faded {{in the type}} specimen, currently kept in MNHN, where it appears dark dusky-horn). Also, the crissum (the area around the cloaca) of the male is black and frequently has white spots. The plumage of the female is closer {{to that of the}} female <b>ultramarine</b> <b>grosbeak</b> than that of the female black-and-white tanager, but a longer, more detailed description is currently being prepared for publication.|$|E
5000|$|As of 2009 the Ecological Station was a [...] "strict nature reserve" [...] under IUCN {{protected}} area category Ia.Migratory species include royal tern (Sterna maxima), spotted sandpiper (Actitis macularia), South American tern (Sterna hirundinacea), white-rumped sandpiper (Calidris fuscicollis), Cape petrel (Daption capense), wandering albatross (Diomedea exulans), Wilson's storm petrel (Oceanites oceanicus), Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus), orange-breasted falcon (Falco deiroleucus), <b>ultramarine</b> <b>grosbeak</b> (Passerina brissonii), peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), great shearwater (Puffinus gravis), black-browed albatross (Thalassarche melanophris), humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), common minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), Atlantic yellow-nosed albatross (Thalassarche chlororhynchos) and giant oceanic manta ray (Manta birostris).|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{scarcity}} of information related to the epidemiology of Cryptosporidium infection in passerine birds, this study aimed to determine the periodicity of fecal shedding of Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts, after natural infection, and its clinical signs, mortality, and molecular characterization. Four hundred eighty fecal samples were collected from 40 birds, including 372 samples from 31 adult birds and 108 samples from nine young birds (up to 12 months old), housed in five aviaries, monthly from September 2007 to September 2008, {{with the exception of}} April. The birds originated from aviaries in which the following species were raised: great-billed seed-finch (Oryzoborus maximiliani), lesser seed-finch (Oryzoborus angolensis), <b>ultramarine</b> <b>grosbeak</b> (Cyanocompsa brissonii), and rusty-collared seedeater (Sporophila collaris). The samples were preserved in 2. 5 % potassium dichromate at 4 A degrees C until processing. The oocysts were purified by centrifugal flotation in Sheather`s solution, followed by genomic DNA extraction and molecular characterization of oocysts using the nested polymerase chain reaction for amplification of fragments of the 18 S subunit of rRNA gene. Intermittent shedding of oocysts was observed by positive amplification for Cryptosporidium spp. in 91 (24. 5 %) samples of adult birds and 14 (13 %) of young birds. The sequencing of the amplified fragments enabled the identification of Cryptosporidium galli. Although all the aviaries had birds positive for C. galli, morbidity or mortality was observed in only one aviary and was associated with concomitant infection with Escherichia coli and Isospora sp.
