5|$|In the National Football League (NFL), a tied game {{occurs when}} a regular season game ends with both teams having an equal score. Since the National Hockey League {{eliminated}} ties by adopting the shootout following the 2004–05 NHL lockout, the NFL {{is the only one}} of the four major professional sports leagues in North America to have tied games in regular-season play, as Major League Baseball (in the modern era since 1900) and the National Basketball Association have historically played <b>until</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> winner. Unlike soccer (association football), in which teams routinely play for a draw (for the benefit of a point in the standings), NFL teams rarely play for ties. In general, tied games in the NFL are frowned upon by both teams and fans. Because tied games are rare, some players have not known they were allowed in the NFL, such as former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb, who said after a tie game against the Cincinnati Bengals that he did not know a tie was a possible result.|$|E

25|$|The Open is a 72-hole {{stroke play}} tournament contested over four days, Thursday through Sunday. Since 1979 {{it has been}} played in the week which {{includes}} the 3rd Friday in July. Currently, 156 players are in the field, mostly {{made up of the}} world's leading professionals, who are given exemptions, along with winners of the top amateur championships. Further places are given to players, amateurs and professionals, who are successful in a number of qualifying events. There is a cut after 36 holes after which only the leading 70 players (and ties) play in the final 36 holes on the weekend. In the event of a tie after 72 holes, a four-hole aggregate playoff is held; if two or more players are still tied, it continues as sudden-death <b>until</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> winner.|$|E

25|$|Balinese Hindu {{dead are}} {{generally}} buried inside the container {{for a period}} of time, which may exceed one month or more, so that the cremation ceremony (Ngaben) can occur on an auspicious day in the Balinese-Javanese Calendar system ("Saka"). Additionally, if the departed was a court servant, member of the court or minor noble, the cremation can be postponed up to several years to coincide with the cremation of their Prince. Balinese funerals are very expensive and the body may be interred until the family can afford it or <b>until</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> group funeral planned by the village or family when costs will be less. The purpose of burying the corpse is for the decay process to consume the fluids of the corpse, which allows for an easier, more rapid and more complete cremation.|$|E
25|$|The {{industry}} has been subject to both praise and condemnation for fansubs, the addition of unlicensed and unauthorized subtitled translations of anime series or films. Fansubs, which were originally distributed on VHS bootlegged cassettes in the 1980s, have been freely available and disseminated online since the 1990s. Since this practice raises concerns for copyright and piracy issues, fansubbers tend to adhere to an unwritten moral code to destroy or no longer distribute an anime once an official translated or subtitled version becomes licensed. They also try to encourage viewers to buy an official copy of the release once it comes out in English, although fansubs typically continue to circulate through file sharing networks. Even so, the laid back regulations of the Japanese animation industry tends to overlook these issues, allowing it to grow underground and thus increasing the popularity <b>until</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> demand for official high quality releases for animation companies. This {{has led to an}} increase in global popularity with Japanese animations, reaching $40 million in sales in 2004.|$|E
25|$|The {{process that}} leads to the {{formation}} of a bait ball typically starts when predators locate a fish school deep below the surface. The predators make rushes and use various scare tactics to force the fish school to the surface, herding {{it at the same time}} into a compact volume. The alarmed fish, trapped against the surface above and surrounded all about, abandon their coordinated schooling movements and become chaotic. Their graceful and disciplined schooling strategies of uniform spacing and polarity degrade into frenetic attempts by each fish to save itself. In this way, a dense bait ball forms as each fish scrambles to get away from the surface of the ball and hide in the interior. The symmetry of this centripetal action forms a sphere, the shape with the minimum surface area for a given volume, thereby exposing the fewest number of fish on the surface to the predators. The movement, sound and smell can attract more predators, including different predator species, <b>until</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> carousel of them, each species using its own characteristic predatory strategies. Fish that break loose are singled out and eaten. A frenzy can develop as predators compete, the water reddening with blood as shredded flesh and scales drift to the depths. As the bait ball reduces in size and number, it becomes progressively easier for the predators to target the survivors.|$|E

2500|$|Six-bar: riders jump six fences {{set in a}} {{straight}} line.
