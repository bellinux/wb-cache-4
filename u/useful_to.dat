5|$|Biostratigraphy, {{the use of}} fossils to {{work out}} the chronological order in which rocks were formed, is <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> both paleontologists and geologists. Biogeography studies the spatial {{distribution}} of organisms, and is also linked to geology, which explains how Earth's geography has changed over time.|$|E
5|$|In {{those with}} {{suspected}} DVT, a clinical assessment of probability can be <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> determine which tests to perform. The most studied clinical prediction rule is the Wells score.|$|E

5|$|Many {{over-the-counter}} treatments in {{many forms}} are available, which are {{often referred to as}} cosmeceuticals. Certain types of makeup may be <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> mask acne. In those with oily skin, a water-based product is often preferred.|$|E
5|$|On October 13 and 14, two ships, the London Spirit and the Marie Maersk, {{encountered}} {{winds of}} tropical storm or hurricane force. The Marie Maersk was located especially {{close to the}} eye, and its observations were <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> forecasters.|$|E

5|$|A {{high blood}} {{prolactin}} level {{within the first}} 20 minutes following a seizure may be <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> help confirm an epileptic seizure as opposed to psychogenic non-epileptic seizure. Serum prolactin level is less useful for detecting focal seizures. If it is normal an epileptic seizure is still possible and a serum prolactin does not separate epileptic seizures from syncope. It is not recommended as a routine part of the diagnosis of epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} persons who {{associated}} themselves with Europeans and proved themselves <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> white people achieved positions in the native society through fraud and extortion. But the Europeans, having noticed it, stopped it. They could discern natives of the noble class by their loyalty and honesty.|$|E
5|$|An {{electroencephalogram}} (EEG) {{can assist}} in showing brain activity suggestive of {{an increased risk of}} seizures. It is only recommended for those who are likely to have had an epileptic seizure on the basis of symptoms. In the diagnosis of epilepsy, electroencephalography may help distinguish the type of seizure or syndrome present. In children it is typically only needed after a second seizure. It cannot be used to rule out the diagnosis and may be falsely positive in those without the disease. In certain situations it may be <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> perform the EEG while the affected individual is sleeping or sleep deprived.|$|E

5|$|As Griet cleans Vermeer's studio, {{which his}} wife Catharina (Essie Davis) never enters, the painter begins to {{converse}} with her and encourages her appreciation of painting, light and color. Vermeer gives her lessons in mixing paints and other tasks, taking care to keep this secret from his wife, who would react with anger and jealousy if she found out {{that her husband was}} spending time with Griet. In contrast, Vermeer's pragmatic mother-in-law, Maria Thins (Judy Parfitt), sees Griet as <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> Vermeer's career.|$|E
5|$|As {{a symbol}} of the Caliph's ritual role {{as the leader of the}} Muslim community, they were closely paralleled in {{official}} propaganda by the leadership by Abbasid family members of the annual pilgrimage (hajj) to Mecca. In addition, the constant warfare on the Syrian marches was <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> the Abbasids as it provided employment for the Syrian and Iraqi military elites and the various volunteers (muṭṭawi‘a) who flocked to participate in the jihad.|$|E
5|$|As {{computers}} {{offered more}} advanced user interfaces, such as windows and point-and-click menus, many traditional roguelikes were modified to include support for having multiple windows. This was <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> not only show the character-based dungeon, but {{details on the}} character's inventory, the monster they were in battle with, and other status messages, in separate windows. Having access to multiple windows also allowed having menus to complete more complex commands.|$|E

5|$|During their {{retreat from}} Quebec, the Americans {{carefully}} took or destroyed all ships on Lake Champlain that might prove <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> the British. When Arnold and his troops, {{making up the}} rear guard of the army, abandoned Fort Saint-Jean, they burned or sank all the boats they could not use, and {{set fire to the}} sawmill and the fort. These actions effectively denied the British any hope of immediately moving onto the lake.|$|E
5|$|FLCN {{mutations}} are {{detected by}} sequencing in 88% of probands with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome. This means {{that some people}} with the clinical diagnosis have mutations that are not detectable by current technology, or that mutations in another currently unknown gene could be responsible for a minority of cases. In addition, amplifications and deletions in exonic regions are also tested. Genetic testing can be <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> confirm the clinical diagnosis of {{and to provide a}} means of determining other at-risk individuals in a family even if they have not yet developed BHD symptoms.|$|E
5|$|For adults, {{the testing}} of electrolyte, blood glucose and calcium levels is {{important}} to rule out problems with these as causes. An electrocardiogram can rule out problems with {{the rhythm of the}} heart. A lumbar puncture may be <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> diagnose a central nervous system infection but is not routinely needed. In children additional tests may be required such as urine biochemistry and blood testing looking for metabolic disorders.|$|E

5|$|For {{practical}} purposes, it is <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> {{define a}} common reference point to which potentials may be expressed and compared. While {{this could be}} at infinity, a much more useful reference is the Earth itself, which {{is assumed to be}} at the same potential everywhere. This reference point naturally takes the name earth or ground. Earth is assumed to be an infinite source of equal amounts of positive and negative charge, and is therefore electrically uncharged—and unchargeable.|$|E
5|$|Maggots {{found on}} corpses are <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> {{forensic}} entomologists. Maggot species {{can be identified}} by their anatomical features and by matching their DNA. Maggots of different species of flies visit corpses and carcases at fairly well-defined times {{after the death of}} the victim, and so do their predators, such as beetles in the family Histeridae. Thus, {{the presence or absence of}} particular species provides evidence for the time since death, and sometimes other details such as the place of death, when species are confined to particular habitats such as woodland.|$|E
5|$|Many dipterans serve {{roles that}} are <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> humans. Houseflies, blowflies and fungus gnats (Mycetophilidae) are {{scavengers}} and aid in decomposition. Robber flies (Asilidae), tachinids (Tachinidae) and dagger flies and balloon flies (Empididae) are predators and parasitoids of other insects, helping {{to control a}} variety of pests. Many dipterans such as bee flies (Bombyliidae) and hoverflies (Syrphidae) are pollinators of crop plants.|$|E
