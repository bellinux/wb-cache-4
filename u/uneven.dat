5|$|Because {{glass is}} very brittle in its solid state, {{it is often}} prone to {{cracking}} upon heating and cooling, especially if the heating and cooling are <b>uneven.</b> This is because the brittleness of glass {{does not allow for}} <b>uneven</b> thermal expansion. Glass that has been welded will usually need to be cooled very slowly and evenly through the glass transition, in a process called annealing, to relieve any internal stresses created by a temperature gradient.|$|E
5|$|Before both battles, the <b>uneven</b> {{deployments}} {{were kept}} secret by controlling aerial reconnaissance through British air superiority.|$|E
5|$|In event finals, she won {{the gold}} on the <b>uneven</b> bars and balance beam and the silver on the floor exercise.|$|E
5|$|Liukin {{performed}} all-around in the qualifying {{round of}} competition. She fell on her dismount from the <b>uneven</b> bars, but nevertheless qualified to the all-around final {{with a score}} of 63.325, which ranked her just behind Shawn Johnson, her friend and Olympic roommate. Liukin also qualified to three event finals: beam, <b>uneven</b> bars (in spite of the fall) and floor exercise.|$|E
5|$|At the 2007 National Championships, Sacramone competed {{on three}} events, {{choosing}} {{to skip the}} <b>uneven</b> bars. She defended her title on the vault, placed second on the floor exercise and third on the balance beam. Following Nationals, she {{was named to the}} American team for the World Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the game}} was noted to have some flaws. The game was criticized for its <b>uneven</b> {{difficulty}}. Reviewers have also noted some difficulty in getting the game to recognize the correct Celestial Brush patterns, as well as excessive amounts of dialog, particularly at the introduction, which was also hampered by the computer-generated voices used instead of voice acting.|$|E
5|$|In addition, without , a {{wheeled vehicle}} can become stuck {{on top of}} an {{obstacle}}, with the obstacle between the wheels, preventing them from contacting the ground. Limbs, in contrast, are useful for climbing and are equipped to deal with <b>uneven</b> terrain.|$|E
5|$|In the gymnastic events {{there were}} also several dead heats for gold medals, in the women's <b>uneven</b> bars and balance beam, {{as well as the}} men's rings. There was a four-way tie for second place in the men's vault {{resulting}} in four silver medals being handed out for a single event.|$|E
5|$|Liukin {{competed in}} her first National Championships as a junior in 2002, {{at the age of}} 12 and a half. In {{contrast}} to her WOGA teammates Carly Patterson and Hollie Vise, who finished first and second, respectively, Liukin suffered a fall on the <b>uneven</b> bars that rendered her unable to finish the routine. She continued {{through the rest of the}} competition and, despite the incomplete bars set, finished 15th, which landed her one of the final spots on the U.S. National Team. She was chosen to compete with the U.S. team at the 2002 Junior Pan American Championships, where she contributed to the team gold medal and placed second on the <b>uneven</b> bars and balance beam and in the all-around.|$|E
5|$|Liukin's {{first meet}} of the 2008 season was the American Cup in New York City, where she {{defeated}} 2007 winner Shawn Johnson to regain her title. She posted the highest {{score of the}} meet, a 16.600 on the <b>uneven</b> bars. In March, Nastia competed at the Pacific Rim (formerly Pacific Alliance) Championships in San Jose, where she led the American team to a gold medal and won the all-around and balance beam titles. In the team competition, Liukin posted an all-time high score of 16.650 on the <b>uneven</b> bars, but in event finals, she fell on her Gienger release move {{and took a step}} on her dismount, earning a 15.225 and taking second place.|$|E
5|$|One {{possible}} explanation for this asymmetry is a large-scale convection above the core. The convection can create variations in the local abundances of elements, resulting in <b>uneven</b> nuclear burning during the collapse, bounce and resulting expansion.|$|E
5|$|Rails {{and allies}} mainly occupy dense {{vegetation}} in damp environments near lakes, marshes or rivers. Many are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most species have strong legs and long toes which are well adapted to soft <b>uneven</b> surfaces.|$|E
5|$|Rough {{grassland}} {{with false}} oat-grass, Yorkshire fog, yarrow, cat's ear, with bracken {{at the south}} end. There is an <b>uneven</b> hedge of hawthorn and buckthorn. The sunny south-west aspect encourages butterflies including holly blue, Essex skipper and small skipper.|$|E
5|$|Shore Line East {{service to}} New London {{is limited by}} slots {{available}} over the Connecticut River bridge between Old Saybrook and Old Lyme; service is operated at <b>uneven</b> headways on weekdays and weekends. Multi-ride and monthly Shore Line East tickets are accepted on several Northeast Regional trains as well.|$|E
5|$|The Linyphiidae {{generally}} make horizontal but <b>uneven</b> sheets, with tangles {{of stopping}} threads above. Insects {{that hit the}} stopping threads fall onto the sheet or are shaken onto it by the spider, and are held by sticky threads on the sheet until the spider can attack from below.|$|E
5|$|The {{collection}} saw graphical {{and musical}} revisions {{and is based}} on the international versions of both games, making certain content accessible to players outside of Japan for the first time. The collection sold favorably in Japan and the west, and has received positive reviews in western territories. Many praised the graphical upgrade and the chance to play through the games on the new platforms. The collection did receive criticism for a few minor upgrade faults and <b>uneven</b> quality between the two, while some of the collection's added content drew mixed opinions. The minor upgrade faults and <b>uneven</b> quality were fixed in the PlayStation 4 version.|$|E
5|$|The <b>uneven</b> {{distribution}} of visitors creates further stresses. Dovedale alone receives an estimated two million visitors annually; other highly visited areas include Bakewell, Castleton and the Hope Valley, Chatsworth, Hartington and the reservoirs of the Upper Derwent Valley. Over 60% of visits {{are concentrated in}} the period May–September, with Sunday being the busiest day.|$|E
5|$|Very <b>uneven</b> meadow with mounds {{formed by}} the yellow meadow ant Lasius flavus, fox earths, and spoil dumped during former gravel works. Grasses {{especially}} false oat-grass, Yorkshire fog; also cock's-foot, common bent and sheep's fescue. Herbs include common vetch, meadow vetchling, white clover, yarrow, ribwort plantain.|$|E
5|$|A rift {{opened and}} {{subsequently}} flooded {{the region as}} part of the breakup of the supercontinent Rodinia in the Neoproterozoic (by about 755million years ago) and the creation of the Pacific Ocean. A shoreline similar to the present Atlantic Ocean margin of the United States lay to the east. An algal mat-covered carbonate bank was deposited, forming the Noonday Dolomite. Subsidence of the region occurred as the continental crust thinned and the newly formed Pacific widened, forming the Ibex Formation. An angular unconformity (an <b>uneven</b> gap in the geologic record) followed.|$|E
5|$|Both the London (1993) and New York (1994) cast albums of the Hytner {{production}} contain {{portions of}} dialogue that, according to Hischak, {{speak to the}} power of Michael Hayden's portrayal of Billy. Kenrick judges the 1994 recording the best all-around performance of Carousel on disc, despite <b>uneven</b> singing by Hayden, due to Sally Murphy's Julie and the strong supporting cast (calling Audra McDonald the best Carrie he has heard). The Stratford Festival issued a recording in 2015.|$|E
5|$|By 2003, Liukin {{was one of}} {{the strongest}} junior gymnasts in the United States. She won the junior {{division}} of the U.S. National Championships, as well as gold medals on three of the four events: <b>uneven</b> bars, balance beam and floor exercise. She repeated these accomplishments in 2004. Liukin {{was a member of the}} gold-medal winning U.S. team at the 2003 Pan Am Games; she took second place in the all-around behind fellow American Chellsie Memmel. She also won the all-around in the junior division of the 2004 Pacific Alliance Championships.|$|E
5|$|Citizens in {{the south}} were opposed to a {{centralised}} government, and to the decrees of its rule, which resulted in rebellion. Prior to the revolution France had been divided into provinces with local governments. In 1790 the government, the National Constituent Assembly, reorganised France into administrative departments in order to rebalance the <b>uneven</b> distribution of French wealth, which had been subject to feudalism under the monarchical Ancien Régime.|$|E
5|$|Early games {{involved}} varying {{numbers of}} players. Games {{could also be}} played with <b>uneven</b> numbers on each side either because some failed to show or one side offered a handicap. The first match between Sheffield and Hallam involved 16 players versus 20. Games predominantly involved larger numbers than used in the modern games. In October 1863, Sheffield declared that it would only play 11 a side matches. Despite this it continued to do so on occasions. By 1867 {{the vast majority of}} matches in Sheffield involved teams of between 11 and 14.|$|E
5|$|Fantasia 2000 premiered on December 17, 1999, at Carnegie Hall in New York City {{as part of}} {{a concert}} tour that also visited London, Paris, Tokyo, and Pasadena, California. The film was {{released}} in 75 IMAX theaters worldwide from January 1 to April 30, 2000, marking the first animated feature-length film to be released in the format. Its general release in traditional theaters followed on June 16, 2000. Some critics praised the film while others singled out its <b>uneven</b> quality. Budgeted at about $80–$85 million, the film has earned $90.8 million in gross revenue worldwide.|$|E
5|$|He was not {{an elegant}} exponent. His normal {{language}} is flat and monotonous. But <b>uneven,</b> and significantly so. For this author is erudite, a fancier of words, and a collector. Hence many rarities, or even inventions... first, when depicting the measures of a military disciplinarian, he brings in technical terms redolent of the camp. Second, archaism, preciosity, and flowery words.|$|E
5|$|In {{the team}} finals, Liukin {{performed}} on three events: beam, bars and floor exercise. Her <b>uneven</b> bars score of 16.900 {{was the highest}} mark awarded in the entire Olympic competition. Liukin performed second on balance beam, matching her qualifying score of 15.975. On floor exercise, {{she stepped out of}} bounds on her first tumbling pass, incurring a 0.1-point penalty, with a final score of 15.200. The American team earned the silver medal, 2.375 points behind China.|$|E
5|$|Incorrect {{unloading}} sequences and ballasting {{which resulted}} in the buoyancy of the hull becoming <b>uneven</b> and the hull therefore strained: Lack of crew training or knowing malpractice were possible explanations. Total was held largely to blame for this. However, given that all the personnel involved in the unloading had died in the explosion, it was difficult to be certain as to what had happened.|$|E
5|$|Liukin's {{ankle injury}} {{required}} surgery, and the recovery period kept {{her out of}} both national and international competition {{for much of the}} year. In July 2007, although she was still recovering from her injury, she returned to competition {{as a member of the}} American team for the Pan Am Games in Rio de Janeiro. She competed only on bars and beam, contributing to the team's gold-medal finish and winning individual silver medals in the <b>uneven</b> bars and balance beam finals.|$|E
5|$|Liukin's {{struggles with}} the balance beam {{continued}} in the all-around final, where she fell from the apparatus during her flight series. In spite of a 16.100 on bars, the highest score of the day from any competitor on any event, she finished the competition in fifth place. In the event finals, however, Liukin rallied and regained her world champion title on the balance beam with a score of 16.025. She also earned a silver on the <b>uneven</b> bars behind Russia's Ksenia Semenova, scoring a 16.300 after taking a step on her dismount.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{critical}} opinion {{has been}} kinder {{than that of}} Bizet's day. Commentators describe {{the quality of the}} music as <b>uneven</b> and at times unoriginal, but acknowledge the opera as a work of promise in which Bizet's gifts for melody and evocative instrumentation are clearly evident. They have identified clear foreshadowings of the composer's genius which would culminate, 10 years later, in Carmen. Since 1950 the work has been recorded on numerous occasions, in both the revised and original versions.|$|E
5|$|Rallidae is a {{large family}} of small to {{medium-sized}} birds which includes the rails, crakes, coots and gallinules. The most typical family members occupy dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most species have strong legs and long toes which are well adapted to soft <b>uneven</b> surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings and to be weak fliers.|$|E
