40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a novel design for a {{dual-band}} bandpass filter (BPF) based on the conventional second-order, open-loop BPF. By adding series resonant circuits to the open ends of the resonator, we can create two resonant modes from the even and odd modes. One pair of the even and odd modes constitutes the <b>upper</b> <b>passband,</b> while the other pair constitutes the lower passband. By adding another series resonant circuit to the open-loop resonator, we can control the bandwidth of either the <b>upper</b> <b>passband</b> or the lower passband. We can replace the series resonant circuits with simple microstrip line resonators. A dual-band BPF working at both Wi-Fi bands (2. 4 GHz and 5. 8 GHz bands) is designed based on the proposed method and is tested. The measured and simulated results show excellent agreement...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel method to design dual-band bandpass filters with tunable lower passband and fixed <b>upper</b> <b>passband.</b> It utilizes a trimode resonator with three controllable resonant modes. Discriminating coupling {{is used to}} suppress the unwanted mode to avoid the interference. Varactors are utilized to realize tunable responses. The bandwidth of the two bands can be controlled individually. Transmission zeros are generated near the passband edges, resulting in high selectivity. For demonstration, a tunable bandpass filter is implemented. Good agreement between the prediction and measurement validates the proposed method...|$|E
40|$|A compact {{dual-mode}} {{bandstop filter}} {{is presented in}} this letter. From an equivalent circuit viewpoint, a second-order response is obtained by designing a two-pole notch filter with inductive coupling. This equivalent circuit is then implemented by using a dual-mode complementary-split-ring resonator. The proposed bandstop filter prototype has dimensions of 0. 1 λg × 0. 18 λg, where λg defines the guided-wave wavelength. An experimental validation at the center frequency f₀ of 2 GHz shows that the proposed filter can extend the harmonic-free <b>upper</b> <b>passband</b> up to 4. 2 f₀.

40|$|Abstract─A novel internally-coupled {{asymmetric}} stepped-impedance-resonator (SIR) filter {{is proposed}} in this paper. The asymmetric SIR structure not only effectively reduces the circuit size but also provides two transmission zeros near the lower and <b>upper</b> <b>passband</b> edges. The first transmission zero {{is due to}} the series resonance of the quarter-wavelength open stepped-impedance stub, and the second one is produced by anti-parallel coupling between adjacent SIRs. The filter response was simulated using the commercial software HFSS, and agreement between the measured and the simulated results was observed. A 0. 9 -dB insertion loss was achieved in the passband, thus indicating that the proposed filter structure is of practical value...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} new compact bandstop filters (BSFs) with extended upper passbands. In {{the basic}} proposed filter configuration, the conventional quarter-wavelength open-stub resonators are replaced with equivalent two-section stepped impedance resonators. Transmission line analysis {{is used to}} determine the dimensions of the equivalent stepped impedance sections. The filter structure is analyzed using a full wave electromagnetic (EM) simulator and then realized at 2. 3 [*]GHz band. Experiments have also been done to validate the performance of the design concept. Compared with the conventional quarter-wavelength-based bandstop filter, significant extensions of the <b>upper</b> <b>passband</b> beyond 9 [*]GHz and 40 % size reduction are achieved. Two other variations of the proposed basic BSF with further size reduction (more than 60 %) are implemented and their measured performances are verified...|$|E
40|$|A {{high-performance}} planar {{bandstop filter}} with extended upper passbands and improved pass-band return loss is proposed in this article. In this proposed bandstop filter, a novel three-section stepped-impedance structure is suggested {{to improve the}} pass-band reflections without affecting the desired band-stop and extended <b>upper</b> <b>passband</b> performances. The analysis and design considerations of this filter are provided while the proposed design approach is verified by full-wave simulation, microstrip implementation and accurate measurement of a typical fabricated filter operating at 1 GHz(fo). Compared to the conventional one, the proposed bandstop filter has main and obvious advantages of simple single-layer structure, perfect band-stop filtering performance (Suppression of better than 20 dB), excellent low/high pass-band return loss (Reflection of lower than - 17 dB) in the extended upper passbands(Larger than 5. 96 fo), and flat group-delay transmission (Variations of smaller than 0. 22 ns) ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a planar EBG based {{microstrip}} filter {{structure is}} formed by etching {{circles in the}} ground plane and using a modulated microstrip line. These planar EBG microstrip structure provides a wide stopband with high attenuation with high ripples in the passband due periodicity of EBG structure. Windows are used to eliminate the ripples in the passband caused by the periodicity. The coefficients of window distribution function are used for determining the radius of the circles etched in the ground plane. In this paper, a comparison of planar EBG microstrip filter structure using fixed window distribution is done. A comparison of effect of different window distribution on passband and stopband performance is presented. It is found that the Riesz distribution gives the largest bandwidth of 7. 18 GHz with maximum stopband attenuation of 50 dB but with large ripples in the passband while the Poisson distribution gives small ripples in both the lower and <b>upper</b> <b>passband</b> but with smallest bandwidth of 4. 77 GHz and stopband attenuation of 27. 68 dB...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a novel {{perturbation}} {{approach for}} implementing the independently reconfigurable dual-mode dual-band substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) filter is proposed. Dual-frequency manipulation {{is achieved by}} adding perturbation via-holes (the first variable) and changing the lengths of the interference slot (the second variable) in each cavity. The independent control of the <b>upper</b> <b>passband</b> only depends on the second variable while the lower passband is independently tuned by combining the two variables. Using such a design method, a two-cavity dual-band SIW filter is designed and experimentally assessed with four via-holes and an interference slot in each cavity. The dual-band filter not only has a frequency ratio (fR) ranging from 1. 14 to 1. 58 but also {{can be considered as}} a single passband one with a tunable range of 40. 5 % from 1. 26 GHz to 2. 12 GHz. The scattering parameters |S 11 | and |S 21 | are in the range of - 10. 72 dB to - 37. 17 dB and - 3. 67 dB to - 7. 22 dB in the operating dual bands, respectively.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the design and}} fabrication techniques for miniature microwave bandpass filters using multilayer liquid crystal polymer (LCP) technology. As a multilayer technology for microwave devices, LCP is of low cost and light weight. It also has excellent electrical properties across a wide frequency range. These characteristics make it promising {{for the development of}} next generation microwave devices for applications across commercial, defence and civil sectors. However, very limited work has been found in the open literature to apply this technology to the design of miniature bandpass filters, especially at low microwave frequencies. In addition, the reported work shows lack of fabrication techniques, which limits the size reduction of multilayer LCP devices. To address these problems, this thesis develops advanced fabrication techniques for sophisticated LCP structures, such as multilayer capacitors, via connections and cavities. These techniques are then used to support the design of novel miniature bandpass filters for wideband and narrowband applications. For the design of miniature wideband bandpass filters, a cascaded approach, which combines highpass and lowpass filters, is presented first to provide a flexible design solution. This is followed by another novel ultra-wideband bandpass filter which produces extra transmission zeroes with minimum number of elements. It does not only have high performance but also a compact structure for high yield fabrication. For narrowband applications, two types of advanced coupled-resonator filters are developed. One type produces a very good selectivity at the <b>upper</b> <b>passband</b> edge, and its spurious-free stopband is extremely wide and of high interference attenuation. The other type, based on novel mixed-couplings approaches developed in this thesis, provides a solution to produce almost the same response as the coupling matrix prototype. This type is used to generate arbitrarily-located transmission zeroes. All designs presented in this thesis are simulated using CAD design tools and then validated by measurements of fabricated samples. Good agreements between simulations and measurements are shown in the thesis...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} meet the {{increasing}} demands of advance wireless communications and radar systems, several novel types of bandpass filters and bandstop filters have been developed in this thesis. A new type of varactor-tuned dual-mode bandpass filters have been presented to achieve a nearly constant absolute bandwidth over a wide tuning range by using a single DC bias circuit. Since the two operating modes (i. e., the odd and even modes) in a dualmode microstrip open-loop resonator do not couple to each other, tuning the passband frequency is accomplished by merely changing the two modal frequencies proportionally. Design equations and procedures are derived, and two two-pole tunable bandpass filters and a four-pole tunable bandpass filter of this type are demonstrated experimentally. Miniature microstrip doublet dual-mode filters that exhibit quasi-elliptic function response without using any cross coupling have been developed. It shows that a single two-pole filter or the doublet can produce two transmission zeros resulting from a double behaviour of the dual-mode resonator of this type. Electromagnetic (EM) simulation and experiment results of the proposed filters are described. Parallel feed configuration of a microstrip quasi-elliptic function bandpass filter has been built with a pair of open-loop dual-mode resonators. By employing this new coupling scheme, a novel filter topology with three-pole quasi-elliptic function frequency response can be obtained, leading to good passband performance, such as low insertion loss and good matching at the mid-band of passband. A designed three-pole bandpass filter of this type is demonstrated experimentally. A new class of dual-band filters based on non-degenerate dual-mode microstrip slow-wave open-loop resonators, which support two non-degenerate modes that do not couple, have been introduced. Different feed schemes that affect the filtering characteristics are investigated. Examples of dual-band filters of this type are described with simulation and experiment results. iii In order to achieve a wide spurious-free <b>upper</b> <b>passband,</b> a novel design of bandstop filter with cancellation of first spurious mode by using coupled three-section step impedance resonators (SIRs) has been developed. This cancellation occurs when two transmission poles coincide with the first spurious mode (transmission zero) by properly choosing the step impedance ratio and the gap between the SIR and the main transmission line. A stripline bandstop filter and a microstrip bandstop filter of this type are designed, fabricated and tested. As a preliminary investigation, the microstrip filter is tuned electronically using ferroelectric thin film varactors...|$|E
