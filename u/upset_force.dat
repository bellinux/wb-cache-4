Rotation {{of the lower}} ¯ at die accompanied by axial compression of the punch plays a distinct role in saving axial force. In this study, an upper bound analysis considering bulge formation, ® nite element method simulations (DEFORM 3 D) and experimental research were carried out. A simple kinematically admissible velocity ® eld for three-dimensional deformation is presented for twist-assisted upset forging of a cylindrical billet. An analytical expression for the <b>upset</b> <b>force</b> and torque is obtained from several process parameters. An increase in the friction factor and rotation speed was found to favour decreases in {{the magnitude of the}} <b>upset</b> <b>force,</b> dead metal zone and non-homogeneous deformation. Plasticine model experiments were performed where the lower die was rotated against the workpiece using a 5 ton model press...|$|E
40|$|Aluminum alloy {{is one of}} {{materials}} that is difficult joining with fusion welding. Friction welding is solution to solve engineering problems in joinning with fusion welding. The parametersthat influence onfriction weldingare frictiontime, rotational speed, compressive force, and <b>upset</b> <b>force.</b> In this study, specimens were friction welded with rotation speed of 1600 rpm, compressive force during friction welding 123 kgf for 120 seconds, and <b>upset</b> <b>force</b> 202 kgf for 120 seconds. The weakness of the friction welding process is a decline in strength, it is due to friction welding is done in solid condition. In order to increase tensile strength of friction welding joint, precipitation hardening methods can be used. Precipitation hardening methods carried out in three stages, solution heat treatment, quenching and agingwith artificial aging process. The artificial aging temperature variated by 150 C, 185 0 C 200 0 C, and 225 0 C with a holding time in 7 hours. The results showed that precipitation hardening cause porosity decreasedin the weld joint. Specimens with a aging temperature 150 0 C and holding time for 7 hours has the smallest porosity of 0, 11 % and it has maximum tensile strength of 186, 65 MPa...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, an Al-ZrO 2 system {{composite}} synthesized by XD {{method is}} welded {{by a new}} plasma arc fusion-pressure welding method. Their joint forms and microstructures are investigated.

There are no defects such as large gas pore, micro-hole, or incomplete fusion in the joint. During the solidification of the molten pool, the melted Zr 3 Al grows fully along the minimum growing energy direction, thus the slender stick precipitates of Zr 3 Al appear in the weld. The joint form and the microstructure are affected by the processing parameters such as welding current. For example, a larger current will cause the defect of micro-hole in the joint...|$|E
40|$|A {{torsional}} {{upset forging}} process is analysed {{on the basis}} of plasticity theory for powder metal forging. Torsional upset forging is a process to be performed by rotating a lower die with a punch travelling along the longitudinal direction of a work-piece. In this study, an upper bound analysis considering bulging effect, finite element method simulation (DEFORM 3 D), and experimental research have been performed for the process. A simple kinematically admissible velocity field for a three dimensional deformation is presented for the torsional upset forging of a cylindrical billet. Distributions of stress, strain, and forging load in the process have been obtained, and compared with those in conventional upset forging. In the process, an increase in a friction factor and rotation speed results in a decrease in magnitude of <b>upset</b> <b>force,</b> dead metal zone, and non-homogeneous deformation. This process can reduce forming load, which leads to improvement of die life, and also reduce bulging effect. In addition, the initial sintered-structure and density distribution is improved by the process and surface defect due to high deformation is decreased. <br /...|$|E

The joint characterization studies include microstructural examination and evaluation of mechanical (micro-hardness, impact toughness and tensile) and pitting corrosion behaviour. The integrity of the joint, {{as determined by the}} optical microscopy was very high and no crack and area of incomplete bonding were observed. Welds exhibited poor Charpy impact toughness than the parent material. Toughness for friction weld specimens decreased with increase in forge force. The tensile properties of all the welds were almost the same (irrespective {{of the value of the}} applied forge force) and inferior to those of the parent material. The joints failed in the weld region for all the weld specimens.

50|$|Upset welding (UW)/resistance {{butt welding}} is a welding {{technique}} that produces coalescence simultaneously {{over the entire}} area of abutting surfaces or progressively along a joint, by the heat obtained from resistance to electric current through the area where those surfaces are in contact..Pressure is applied before heating is started and is maintained throughout the heating period. The equipment used for upset welding {{is very similar to}} that used for flash welding. It can be used only if the parts to be welded are equal in cross-sectional area. The abutting surfaces must be very carefully prepared to provide for proper heating.The difference from flash welding is that the parts are clamped in the welding machine and force is applied bringing them tightly together. High-amperage current is then passed through the joint, which heats the abutting surfaces. When they have been heated to a suitable forging temperature an <b>upsetting</b> <b>force</b> is applied and the current is stopped. The high temperature of the work at the abutting surfaces plus the high pressure causes coalescence to take place. After cooling, the force is released and the weld is completed.|$|R
