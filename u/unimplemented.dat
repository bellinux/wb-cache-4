5|$|After the war, {{plans to}} {{complete}} the Northern Heights project were reviewed. In early 1946, {{the conversion of the}} LNER line from Mill Hill East to Edgware was scheduled by the LPTB for completion between January 1947 and June 1948.

5|$|Capitol Hill {{had been}} {{proposed}} {{as the site}} of a subway stop in <b>unimplemented</b> plans from 1911 and 1968, but voter approval did not come until 1996. It was built as part of the University Link Extension, which began construction in 2009 and opened on March 19, 2016. Construction of the station required the demolition of two city blocks along Broadway, which will be redeveloped into a transit-oriented, mixed-use complex in 2019. Light rail trains serve the station 20 hours a day on most days; the headway between trains is 6 minutes during peak periods, with less frequent service at other times. The station is also served by the First Hill Streetcar and several King County Metro bus routes at nearby stops.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, civil {{engineer}} Virgil Bogue presented {{a comprehensive plan}} {{for the city of}} Seattle, including an elevated rapid transit line running southeast from King Street Station through Chinatown towards the Rainier Valley. The plan was, however, rejected by voters on March 5, 1912, leaving it <b>unimplemented.</b> In 1957, Seattle City Engineer M. O. Anderberg and the Seattle Transit Commission proposed a rapid transit system utilizing the right-of-way cleared for Interstate 5 between Everett and Tacoma. The rapid transit line would travel through downtown Seattle in a tunnel under 5th Avenue, with one of its two stations at South Jackson Street at the site of Union Station. The proposal included redevelopment of Union Station into a multi-level transportation hub, with a bus terminal for intercity and suburban buses, a public parking garage, and a rooftop heliport. The proposal was rejected by the federal government, not wanting to jeopardize freeway construction, and was ultimately shelved.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} {{tried to}} revive the renovation of the canal by enacting a legal program to lift the channel {{to the standards of}} the Freycinet gauge. The canals of northern France were already at this level and had traffic well above the Canal du Midi. However, the law remained <b>unimplemented</b> due to lack of funds.|$|E
25|$|The People's Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ) is {{the ruling}} party in Eritrea.

The National Assembly has 150 seats, of which 75 are occupied by the PFDJ. National elections have been periodically scheduled and cancelled; none have ever been held in the country. The president, Isaias Afwerki, has been in office since independence in 1993.|$|E
25|$|In Sweden, {{there was}} a debate in the late 18th century about the {{national}} value of using the moose as a domestic animal. Among other things, the moose was proposed {{to be used in}} postal distribution, and {{there was a}} suggestion to develop a moose-mounted cavalry. Such proposals remained <b>unimplemented,</b> mainly because the extensive hunting for moose that was deregulated in the 1790s nearly drove it to extinction. While there has been documented cases of individual moose being used for riding and/or pulling carts and sleds, Björklöf concludes no wide-scale usage has occurred outside fairytales.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{restructuring}} of Assam after independence, communal tensions and violence remain. Separatist groups began forming along ethnic lines, and demands for autonomy and sovereignty grew, resulting in the fragmentation of Assam. In 1961, the government of Assam passed legislation making use of the Assamese language compulsory. It was withdrawn later under pressure from Bengali speaking people in Cachar. In the 1980s the Brahmaputra valley saw a six-year Assam Agitation triggered by {{the discovery of a}} sudden rise in registered voters on electoral rolls. It tried to force the government to identify and deport foreigners illegally migrating from neighbouring Bangladesh and changing the demographics of the Indigenous Assamese people and also provide constitutional, legislative, administrative and cultural safeguards for the Indigenous Assamese people. The agitation ended after an accord between its leaders and the Union Government, which remained <b>unimplemented,</b> causing simmering discontent.|$|E

500|$|Efforts {{to repair}} the damage caused by the flood and prevent future {{disasters}} began in 1911 when George Kessler, a city planner, created a plan for both the Trinity and the city. [...] His plans included using levees to divert the river, removing railroad lines on Pacific Avenue, consolidating train depots into a central station, new parks and playgrounds, and the straightening and widening of several streets. [...] Most of his plans went <b>unimplemented</b> for one or two decades, but in later years, many city officials began to see their importance. Kessler was brought back in 1920 to update his plans, and by the 1930s many had been realized.|$|E
500|$|Although {{small groups}} of Armenian fedayi {{conducted}} an armed struggle against the Ottoman state and the Kurdish tribes, the situation in Western Armenia deteriorated as the European powers stood indifferent to the Armenian Question. Article 61 of the 1878 Treaty of Berlin intended the Ottoman government to [...] "carry out, without further delay, the improvements and reforms demanded by local requirements in the provinces inhabited by the Armenians, and to guarantee their security against the Circassians and Kurds" [...] remained <b>unimplemented.</b> According to Christopher J. Walker, {{the attention of the}} European powers was on Macedonia, while Russia was [...] "in no mood for reactivating the Armenian question".|$|E
500|$|Sifton's {{first foray}} into {{politics}} was in 1878, when he campaigned for the introduction of prohibition {{under the auspices of}} the Canada Temperance Act in the Manitoba electoral districts of Lisgar and Marquette. [...] His first bid for elected office took place in 1882, when he was elected to Brandon's first city council. [...] He was re-elected in 1883, and did not seek re-election at the conclusion of this second term, though he did briefly consider running for mayor before concluding that he had insufficient support to be elected. [...] He also served on the local school board. [...] When his brother Clifford became Wilfrid Laurier's Minister of the Interior in November 1896, Sifton advised him on Liberal Party affairs in western Canada. [...] This advice included suggested patronage appointments, one of which was an <b>unimplemented</b> proposal that Arthur himself be appointed chief justice of the Northwest Territories (a position that did not at the time exist). [...] In 1898, Sifton re-entered politics—Hall speculates to increase his chances at a judgeship—by challenging Robert Brett, the long-time Member of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories for Banff, in the 1898 territorial election. [...] Election day returns showed Sifton with a plurality of thirty-six votes, but by the time contested ballots were dealt with this had turned into a majority of two votes for Brett. [...] Sifton successfully challenged this result in court, and in the ensuing by-election he defeated Brett by a comfortable margin. [...] One oft-repeated anecdote from the campaign involved a campaign forum for which Brett was late. [...] After giving his own speech, Sifton offered to give the still-absent Brett's speech as well, since he had heard it so many times. [...] He did so, and when Brett eventually arrived to give a speech nearly identical to the one Sifton had given on his behalf he was puzzled by the audience's amusement.|$|E

The shapes of Romanesque (simple geometric figures such as cuboids and semicircular arches), Gothic (upward-pointing lines, slim towers, delicate embellishments) and Byzantine architecture and art (the Throne Hall décor) were mingled in an eclectic fashion and supplemented with 19th-century technical achievements.

2500|$|At the XIIth Party Congress in April 1923, however, {{just after}} Lenin's final stroke, Trotsky {{did not raise}} the issue. Instead, he made a speech about intra-party {{democracy}} while avoiding any direct confrontation of the troika. Stalin had prepared for the congress by replacing many local party delegates with those loyal to him, mostly {{at the expense of}} Zinoviev and Kamenev's backers. The delegates, most of whom were unaware of the divisions within the Politburo, gave Trotsky a standing ovation. This upset the troika, already infuriated by Karl Radek's article, [...] "Leon Trotsky – Organizer of Victory" [...] published in Pravda on 14 March 1923. Stalin delivered the key reports on organizational structure and questions of nationality; while Zinoviev delivered the Central Committee political report, traditionally Lenin's prerogative. Among the resolutions adopted by the XIIth Congress were those calling for greater democracy within the Party, but these were vague and remained <b>unimplemented.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Occurring during Ireland's Revolutionary period, the Irish Catholic {{experience}} {{of the war was}} complex and its memory of it divisive. At the outbreak of the war, most Irish people, regardless of political affiliation, supported the war {{in much the same way}} as their British counterparts, and both nationalist and unionist leaders initially backed the British war effort. Their followers, both Catholic and Protestant, served extensively in the British forces, many in three specially raised divisions. [...] Over 200,000 Irishmen fought in the war, in several theatres with 30,000 deaths. [...] In 1916, Catholic supporters of Irish independence from the United Kingdom took the opportunity of the ongoing war to proclaim an Irish Republic and to defend it in an armed rebellion against British rule in Dublin. The rebellion was poorly planned and quickly suppressed. The British executed most of the prisoners which caused Catholic opinion to surge in favour of independence. [...] Britain's intention to impose conscription in Ireland in 1918 provoked widespread resistance and as a result remained <b>unimplemented.</b>|$|E
