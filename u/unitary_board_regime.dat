40|$|In South Africa, {{there is}} no doubt that the duties of company {{directors}} and managers are issues, which are attracting much attention at present. With rapidly developing and changing labour legislation in South Africa, it is essential to consider the extent to which South Africa should reassess its traditional principles of company law and corporate governance policies in order that it may take into account the participatory roles of employees in the workplace. It is considered that employee participation in decisionmaking in the corporation improves productivity standards and product quality. It has been shown in some countries, such as in the United Kingdom, that where workplacebased institutions for worker representation did not supplement adversarial labour relations, labour and management relations were exceedingly poor. This ultimately affected the efficiency and performance of the enterprise system as a whole. South Africa’s company law is largely based upon the <b>unitary</b> <b>board</b> structure created in England. The main purpose of this paper is to propose a new corporate governance model for South Africa, which would be advantageous to all of its corporate stakeholders. The current <b>unitary</b> <b>board</b> structure operating in South Africa is unacceptable, as it does not provide employees with rights enabling them to engage in the decision-making processes of the corporation with their employers at an adequate level. If South Africa hopes to successfully improve corporate productivity levels with its re-entry into international markets, it is proposed that a new two-tier German-based system of corporate governance be adopted, which would assist in improving management and labour relations and ultimately the productivity of the corporation...|$|R

40|$|My thesis {{attempts}} to search {{evidence on the}} performance of the currency <b>board</b> <b>regime</b> and its impact on Hong Kong’s economy. Three sets of related questions have been set up and carefully investigated in my empirical models. Chapter 2 investigates output growth and inflation rate in order to compare the historical performance of free-floating and currency <b>board</b> <b>regimes</b> for Hong Kong. I apply some advanced econometrics tools to identify my structural VAR models and offer appropriate analysis. My first empirical model suggests that output returns to a steady state much faster in a flexible exchange rate regime than in a fixed exchange rate regime after an aggregate demand shock. My evidence offers an essential answer to the question on why the recovering process of Hong Kong from the Asian financial crisis lasted longer compared with the other Asian countries with a flexible exchange rate regime. Furthermore, my counter-factual analysis suggests that a free-floating regime may generate much smaller output variance in Hong Kong and deliver higher output and price levels to Hong Kong. Chapter 3 investigates the currency <b>board</b> <b>regime</b> from 1984 to 2007, by considering some important variables which have significant impacts on Hong Kong’s economy. For instance my empirical models attempt to examine the economic relationships with the US economy under the currency <b>board</b> <b>regime</b> and the close economic relationships with China under a Closer Economic Partnership Agreement with Mainland China. My models emphasises the importance of entrepot trade for Hong Kong’s economy. Evidence shows that those exogenous variables have significant impacts on Hong Kong’s economy, and they are one of the important factors when considering the choice of exchange rate regimes. My empirical evidence indicates some new findings which contradict existing studies which conclude that the Chinese economy is much less significant than the US economy in explaining Hong Kong’s output variance. Chapter 4 examines the real effective exchange rate misalignment of the two economies, Hong Kong and Singapore, and offers new policy implications on the choice of exchange rate regimes. Entrepot trades are essential to both economies. While the literature has paid little attention to such an important character and shown evidence of larger scale REER misalignment in Hong Kong compared with Singapore, my model reveals that including such an important variable has remarkably improved the model and offered strikingly different conclusions. I have applied Vector Error Correction Modelling and the Johansson Method in identifying the empirical models. Evidence suggests that Hong Kong performs well in terms of small real exchange rate misalignment even under its currency broad regime. My thesis indicates that although there are limitations in the currency broad regime in terms of relatively slow recovery from external demand shocks and relatively larger output variance, the regime is still a preferable choice for Hong Kong, especially when we consider the close economic link with Mainland China and the United States. Moreover, there is no evidence in my models to suggest that the real exchange rate misalignment was significantly larger in the case of Hong Kong’s currency <b>board</b> <b>regime.</b> Thesis (Ph.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the {{monetary}} policy actions through which the central banks in the Sub-Saharan African countries have searched to eliminate the negative impacts of the shocks facing their economies. We compare two types of monetary policy regimes: a currency <b>board</b> <b>regime</b> (in the CFA zone countries) and an inflation targeting policy regime (in Ghana and South Africa). We compare the properties of both policies when the central banks respond to three negative shocks hitting the economies: a recessionary demand shock, a supply shock increasing inflation and a negative fiscal shock. We propose an FPAS model (forecasting and monetary policy analysis system) that extends the usual FPAS models used in the literature to evaluate the impact of several policies in response to different types of exogenous shocks. We find that both policies are inappropriate to help the economies exiting from the effects of negative demand shocks (the adjustment relies mainly on fiscal policy), both are essential when negative shocks to primary balance occur (fiscal policy aggravates the negative effects of the shocks), while inflation targeting dominates the currency <b>board</b> <b>regime</b> as a strategy to cope with positive shocks to inflation...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine the association between board size and firm value using the setting of a developing economy that adopts a two-tier board system. Hence, the present study extends the existing literature which heavily focuses on economies adopting <b>unitary</b> <b>board</b> structure. Employing a sample of non-financial companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX), we perform regression analyses separately for the supervisory board and the management board. Using return on assets (ROA) and Tobin sQas measures of firm value, our results support the proposition that board size and firm value are positively associated. Across different models and estimation techniques, the relationship of board size to Tobin's Q is more robust than that to ROA. Our further analysis also reveals that larger board size is more likely to be employed by larger firms, which benefit from having larger boards. It is suggested that listed companies need to carefully arrange their board structure in their efforts to maximize firm value...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{response}} to the growing recognition that the workings of the financial sphere significantly affect the value of social production, its distribution, and the magnitude of income poverty. The thesis extends a general equilibrium single-country model targeted to a developing economy (the IFPRI Standard Model) to account for the workings of the financial sphere and 'money in the production function', in the tradition begun by Milton Friedman (1969). The models are calibrated and their workings are analysed. It is found that the inclusion of 'money in the production function' by itself only causes financial outcomes to significantly affect the overall level of production and the unemployment rate in the presence of strong wage rigidities. This is explained in terms of the model parameters. The extended model is employed in a stylised static way to identify the short-run stresses generated by current and capital account liberalisation in Argentina during its Currency <b>Board</b> <b>Regime,</b> adopted over 1991 - 2001, with the finding that in the short-run the volatility of capital flows was transmitted to employment and activity levels. The model is then linked in a sequential way to a behavioural microsimulations model, separating out the different transmission channels involved. It is found that the significant capital outflows witnessed by the country surrounding the end of its Currency <b>Board</b> <b>Regime</b> worsened poverty and inequality indicators in the country, and that the main transmission channel through which the capital outflow had the most distributional impact was the selectivity of labour market rationing...|$|R
