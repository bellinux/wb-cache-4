Management of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) can be improved by implementing strategies that optimize plant growth and development. Mid-season water stress, which commonly occurs in the <b>USA,</b> reduce <b>cotton</b> yield and quality. Eight cotton genotypes were field tested for two years to quantify growth and phenological development under full irrigation and mid-season water stress. Significant differences were obtained among genotypes and between water treatments during the season from first square to maturity. Differences were noted for plant height, number of main stem nodes, plant height to node ratio (HNR), number of main stem nodes above the sympodial branch bearing a white flower in the first position from the main axis (NAWF), number of bolls per plant, percent boll retention and lint yield. Averaged over cultivars and years, the irrigated plants produced 3 to 4 more nodes and were 25 cm taller than the water-stressed plants, 95 - 130 days after planting (DAP). Plant height to node ratio (HNR) was on the average 0. 5 units less in the non-irrigated than the irrigated treatment. Reduction in NAWF was I to 1. 8 nodes (76 - 103 DAP) in the non-irrigated plots. Decline in number of nodes, plant height, HNR, NAWF, and boll retention were positively associated with a 39 % reduction in yield in the water stressed treatment. Significant differences were observed among genotypes for most traits. Tamcot Sphinx,CUBQHGRPIS- 1 - 92 and CUBQHGRPIH- 1 - 92 were more tolerant to mid-season water stress than the other genotypes. The results will be useful in developing drought resistant cottons and will provide information for within season and end-of-season crop management strategies...|$|R

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Water {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{limiting}} factors to Australian cotton production. Improved irrigation scheduling efficient water use is central to the sustainability of the Australian irrigated cotton industry. Irrigation scheduling is a two-fold process where-by the amount and frequency of water applied to a plant is determined. Producers must aim to optimise crop water use through timely irrigation scheduling and efficient utilisation of in-crop rainfall. Currently, furrow irrigation is the dominant form of irrigation delivery and cotton farmers use a limited range of methods to make irrigation decisions. A combination of the cost, accuracy and complexity of these methods has limited their effective use in commercial production. In this study a potentially simpler method based on crop canopy temperatures and the thermal optimum concept was investigated. Compared to well-watered plants, water stressed plants exhibit elevated canopy temperatures. This is a consequence of the closing of stomata, in response to soil water deficits. The closure of stomata results in a decrease in transpiration and consequently a reduction in latent energy flux, leading to a rise in canopy temperatures. However, ambient conditions can have a large influence on canopy temperatures; thus canopy temperatures are a reflection of both plant and environmental factors. In order to develop indicators of the early onset of water and temperature stress, research conducted in the USA developed a theory that defined optimal plant temperatures with respect to the thermal dependence of the Michaelis-Menten constant of an enzyme (Km). The optimal enzymatic function was restricted to a range of ambient temperatures that was termed the thermal kinetic window (TKW), which is an indicator of the optimal temperature range of a plant species. Using alternative diagnostic methodologies of chlorophyll fluorescence recovery rates and analysis of plant physiological function under field conditions, the optimal temperature of an Australian cultivar was identified to be 28 °C. Although this was consistent with values obtained from US cotton cultivars, and average day-time canopy temperatures that were achieved in the field at close to optimal water applications, it was important to verify this as Australian cotton cultivars are genetically different to US cultivars and the combined effect of different genetics and ecological adaptations may potentially influence the optimal temperature of biochemistry. The TKW theory was used as the basis for the BIOTIC (Biologically Identified Optimal Temperature Interactive Console) protocol. This protocol was developed by researchers at the USDA-ARS, and uses the relationship between canopy temperature (Tc) and plant water status to schedule irrigation using a temperature-time threshold system. Irrigations are commanded when the crop’s Tc exceeds an optimal temperature threshold for a pre-determined period of time. Using the BIOTIC system as a basis, this study aims to assess the physiological base and utility of the thermal optimal approach to schedule irrigation, with particular emphasis on its use in precision application and large soil water deficit irrigation systems of the Australian cotton industry. Deficit irrigation is an optimisation strategy where full crop water requirements are not necessarily provided, improving water-use efficiency (WUE). The thermal optimal approach was studied previously; however, its use was limited to irrigation systems that provide full water requirements at high irrigation frequencies and low irrigation volumes. Hence, its application to deficit and furrow irrigation systems was unknown. The physiological basis of the principles underlying the thermal optimum concept for irrigation scheduling was examined through the monitoring of Tc of the commercial cotton cultivar Sicot 70 BRF at ‘Myall Vale’ Narrabri Australia. Surface drip irrigation experiments were conducted in the 2007 / 08 and 2008 / 09 seasons, where irrigation treatments were based on daily crop evapotranspiration (ETC) rates calculated using the FAO 56 protocol with a locally calibrated crop coefficient. A furrow-irrigated experiment was conducted in the 2008 / 09 season, where irrigation treatments were based on plant available soil water deficits (mm) from field capacity calculated from neutron attenuation data. The objectives of this research were to: (1) confirm that the optimum temperature (Topt) of a current commercial Australian cotton cultivar (Sicot 70 BRF) is the same as other measured <b>USA</b> <b>cotton</b> cultivars; (2) determine if Tc can define plant water stress by comparison with soil and atmospheric conditions; and (3) determine the potential of the thermal optimum approach to scheduling irrigation in Australian cotton systems. The hypothesis that Tc provides sufficient information for irrigation scheduling was investigated in the surface drip and furrow irrigated cotton. Irrigation treatments resulted in differences in lint yield, plant architecture, growth, biomass accumulation and Tc. Canopy temperatures were correlated with crop lint yield and the volume of water applied to the crop. Peak lint yields occurred at average day-time (Rn > 300 W m- 2) Tc of 26. 4 ± 1. 7 °C and total water of 108...|$|R
30|$|The disk {{diffusion}} {{test was used}} to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of the confirmed bacterial isolates against panels of antimicrobial agents. This test was performed on the E. coli and S. aureus isolates recovered in the present study. The antimicrobial agents tested were Amoxycillin (25 [*]μg), Ampicillin (10 [*]μg), Amoxycillin-Clavulanate (30 [*]μg), Cephalexin (30 [*]μg), Ciprofloxacin (10 [*]μg), Clindamycin (10 [*]μg) and Co-trimoxazole (25 [*]μg). Others include Erythromycin (5 [*]μg), Gentamycin (30 [*]μg), Nalidixic acid (30 [*]μg), Norfloxacin (10 [*]μg), Ofloxacin (5 [*]μg), Pefloxacin (5 [*]μg) and Streptomycin (10 [*]μg). The antimicrogram pattern was determined according to the Kirby Bauer procedure described by Demissie (2011). Briefly, pure colonies of bacterial growth were suspended in tubes containing 5 mls of Brain Heart infusion broth (Sigma-Aldrich, UK) and adjusted to 0.5 McFarland turbidity standards. 10 μl of the diluted bacterial suspensions were transferred to Mueller Hinton agar plates (BBL®, Becton Dickinson, <b>USA)</b> using sterile <b>cotton</b> swab applicator sticks. Excess fluid was squeezed out by rotating the swabs against the sides of the tubes. The plates were then inoculated uniformly by rubbing the swabs against the entire agar surfaces and allowed to dry. The impregnated antimicrobial discs (Optun Laboratories Nig Ltd., Lagos, Nigeria) were applied to the surfaces of the inoculated plates using sterile forceps. All the discs were gently pressed with forceps to ensure complete contact with the agar surface. The discs were placed 1.5 cm away from the edges of the plates and 3 cm away from each other with the guide of a template placed under the petri-dish. The plates were then inverted and incubated aerobically for 24 hr at 37 °C. The zones of inhibition of bacteria by the antimicrobial discs were measured in millimeters using a caliper {{on the underside of the}} plates. The susceptibility of the bacteria was determined based on the breakpoints recommended by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI 2011).|$|R
40|$|Brazil {{has been}} the first {{developing}} country challenging and winning an economic dispute on agricultural issue against the United State of America (USA). This thesis is {{a case study of}} the Cotton Dispute at the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The Cotton Dispute was initiated by Brazil due to certain protectionist subsidies that the <b>USA</b> had on <b>cotton.</b> The study took as a starting point the Brazilian domestic inequality and the presence of a strong agribusiness sector, and it focused on who lied behind the Brazilian victory at the WTO. The aim was to analyse the role of a strong Brazilian cotton association, ABRAPA, in order to understand whether they had influenced the Brazilian WTO policy. ABRAPA is the Brazilian Cotton Growers Association. The analysis followed Putnam’s theoretical framework and was carried in two levels, the domestic and international levels. In addition, Putnam’s theory was integrated with Lukes’s first dimension of power. At the national level ABRAPA played a role in influencing the Brazilian WTO policy by the use of economic, technical, and legal capacities. These represent the association’s potential power in influencing the WTO policy. At the international level, ABRAPA’s role was given by its successful contribution in the dispute. The DSB found in fact that the US subsidies were not conformed to the WTO agreement. However, the study found that ABRAPA’s influence to the Brazilian WTO policy can be understood only in cooperation with the Brazilian Government. ABRAPA and the Government were, in this study, the Brazilian domestic constituency and they had shared economic interests. The interests at stake also contributed in understanding why what started as a dispute in the WTO, ended in a bilateral negotiation. The bilateral negotiation resulted favouring not only the USA, but also ABRAPA and the Government on the Brazilian side. ABRAPA played a role in widening the Brazilian domestic win-set and facilitated the ratification of the bilateral negotiation...|$|R
