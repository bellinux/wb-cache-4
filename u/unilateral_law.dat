40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown adverse effects of growing up under <b>unilateral</b> divorce <b>laws</b> on long-term outcomes of children. It {{remains an open question}} of whether long-term effects of early childhood conditions arise because divorce laws raise the likelihood of parental marital disruption, or whether <b>unilateral</b> divorce <b>laws</b> also affect children in intact marriages by changing intra-household bargaining. Using newly available data from SHARELIFE for eleven Western European countries we address this question employing a differences-in-differences approach and controlling for childhood family structure and socioeconomic status. Like previous research, we find strong adverse effects of growing up under <b>unilateral</b> divorce <b>laws</b> on the well-being of children, and this effect remains even when controlling for childhood variables. We conclude that <b>unilateral</b> divorce <b>laws</b> affect children by changing family bargaining in intact marriages. ...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{literature}} has established that <b>unilateral</b> divorce <b>laws</b> may reduce female household work.

To examine this issue, I use data on matched couples from the PSID and exploit variation over time in state divorce laws. This research indicates that <b>unilateral</b> divorce <b>laws</b> lead to a decrease in marital investment, as measured by both males and females' household work.

40|$|This paper revisits the {{evidence}} {{on the impact of}} <b>unilateral</b> divorce <b>laws</b> on divorce rates in the United States. Most states switched from requiring mutual consent to allowing unilateral or no-fault divorce between 1970 and 1985, while the national divorce rate more than doubled after 1965. According to the Coase theorem, however, the legal shift should have had no effect on divorce rates. Recent papers using cross-sectional micro data have disputed the empirical importance of unilateral divorce, disagreeing in particular about controls for state-level heterogeneity in divorce propensities. This paper uses a panel of state-level divorce rates which includes virtually every divorce in the U. S. over the entire period of the law changes. Adding comprehensive controls - year and state fixed effects and state fixed trends - for changing unobservable divorce propensities reveals that the divorce rate would have been about 6 % lower if states had not switched to unilateral divorce, accounting for 17 % of the increase in the divorce rate between 1968 and 1988. Additional results in this paper demonstrate that the type of <b>unilateral</b> divorce <b>law</b> that states adopted matters. Weaker versions of unilateral divorce, which retain elements of mutual divorce, raised the divorce rate significantly, but by less than the strongest versions of unilateral divorce did. ...|$|R

Recently, this process is of particular interest to spatial instruments applications. Indeed, no mechanical part or glue are required, thanks to that, this is a high-precision production process and bonded assemblies present a dimensional stability. This kind of process has already passed with success the mechanical and thermal environment of space [2] where the constraints involved (thermal fatigue, vibrations, etc.) are very different from those encountered on Earth. However, it is necessary to quantify the bonding strength to improve the mechanical performance of adhesive bonds without degrading optical performances of the material used and to find optimum parameters of the process. Indeed, mechanical resistance of those bonded interfaces depends on interface defects, and especially the nature of bonds involved. Indeed, room temperature bonding needs flatness and roughness perfectly controlled, and no particles contaminations on surfaces [3]. Then, using mechanical test results, an <b>unilateral</b> contact <b>law</b> is developed in order to combine the mechanical properties of the bonded interface to the physical and chemical properties of bonded surfaces.

The model is used to analyse the implications of changing from a title based division of property on divorce to an equal sharing regime. There are two opposing effects. In line with popular expectations, the change to an equal sharing regime prevents some wealthy individuals from marrying since they risk losing half of their assets in the event of divorce. Offsetting this, the equal sharing property division regime enables cooperative investments to be made in marriage, and so increases the value of marriage relative to cohabitation for some couples. Overall the impact on the marriage rate is ambiguous, although the rate is most likely to increase where it is more difficult to make cooperative investments due to <b>unilateral</b> divorce <b>laws,</b> and where couples are more similar to each other, reducing their cost of divorce.

We first formalize three prominent hypotheses on why people marry: marriage provides an exogenous payoff to married partners, it serves as a commitment device, and it serves as a signaling device.

We then use individual marriage and divorce certificate data from the United States to bring these alternative views of the marriage contract to bear on the data. We exploit variations in the timing of the adoption of <b>unilateral</b> divorce <b>laws</b> across states to proxy a one-off and permanent reduction in divorce costs.

40|$|In {{response}} to the changing family and social structures in the United States, an accurate understanding of mechanisms and the driving forces of marrital dissolution is important in many aspects.

Our goal is to provide additional evidence to a debatable issue in labor and family economics: Does married women's labor supply increases the chance of their future divorces? or is the relationship the other way around? Prior studies have produced conflicting results.

40|$|Abstract-The {{fundamental}} {{objectives of}} patello-femoral joint biomechanics include {{the determination of}} its kinematics and of its dynamics, {{as a function of}} given control parameters like knee flexion or applied muscle forces. On the one hand, patellar tracking provides quantitative information about the joint’s stability under given loading conditions, whereas patellar force analyses can typically indicate pathological stress distributions asso-ciated for instance with abnormal tracking. The determination of this information becomes especially relevant when facing the problem of evaluating surgical procedures in terms of standard (i. e. non-pathological) knee functionality. Classical examples of such procedures include total knee replacement (TKR) and elevation of the tibia 1 tubercle (Maquet’s procedure). Following this perspective, the current study was oriented toward an accurate and reliable determination of the human patella biomechanics during passive knee flexion. To this end, a comprehensive three-dimensional computer model, based on the finite element method, was developed for analyzing articular biomechanics. Unlike previously published studies on patello-femoral biomechanics, this model simultaneously computed the joint’s kinematics, associated tendinous and ligamentous forces, articular contact pressures and stresses occurring in the joint during its motion, The components constituting the joint (i. e. bone, cartilage, tendons) were modeled using objective forms of non-linear elastic materials <b>laws.</b> A <b>unilateral</b> contact <b>law</b> allowing for large slip between th...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{response}} of the divorce rate to <b>law</b> reform introducing <b>unilateral</b> divorce after controlling for law reforms concerning the aftermath of divorce, which are omitted from most previous works. We introduce two main policy changes that have swept the U. S. since the late 1970 s; the approval of the joint custody regime and the Child Support Enforcement program. Because those reforms affect divorce decisions by counteracting the reallocation of property rights generated by the unilateral divorce procedure and by increasing the expected financial costs of divorce, it is arguable that their omission might obscure the impact of unilateral divorce reforms on divorce rates. Our results suggest that what has driven the decline in the divorce rate since the 1980 s are law reforms concerning the aftermath of divorce rather than a reverse response of divorce rates to the adoption of <b>unilateral</b> divorce <b>laws.</b> Supplemental analysis, developed to examine the frequency of permanent shocks in U. S. divorce rates, indicates that the positive permanent changes in divorce rates can be associated with the implementation of unilateral divorce, and that the negative permanent changes can be related to the law reforms concerning living arrangement in aftermath of divorce. This seems to confirm the important role of those policies in the evolution of divorce rates. ...|$|R
