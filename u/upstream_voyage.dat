5000|$|Cadell's {{claim on}} being the pioneer of inland {{navigation}} on the Murray is contested. J. G. and William Randell had constructed an earlier steamer which had {{traded on the}} Murray as early as March 1853, {{and at the time}} of the Cadell's first <b>voyage</b> <b>upstream</b> on the Lady Augusta, Randell's Mary-Ann had progressed further up the river and at a greater speed. Neither of the first two paddle steamers to grace the waters of the Murray River were eligible for the bonus offered by the government. A. T. Saunders was a perennial critic, calling Cadell an [...] "overrated braggart".|$|R
50|$|The {{ship was}} built in 1977 at the Tema Shipyard and christened Grains Maid. The vessel was used mainly for the {{transportation}} of dry cargo and agricultural products including fertilizer. A typical <b>voyage</b> <b>upstream</b> would carry goods from Akosombo to Yeji in the Brong-Ahafo Region and Buipe {{in the northern part}} of Ghana and its downstream voyage would return with yam and grains to the southern part of the country. Grains Maid sailed on the lake from its commissioning in the late 1970s to the late 1980s when its commercial services declined due to financial constraints. After months of low patronage of its services, the vessel was abandoned at the port of Akosombo.|$|R
2500|$|... of UFRJ, Brazil, {{proposed}} that Odysseus's {{journey to the}} Underworld takes place in South America. The river Acheron is the Amazon; after a long <b>voyage</b> <b>upstream</b> Odysseus meets {{the spirits of the}} dead at the confluence of the rio Santiago and rio Mara√±on. Two centuries ago, Charles-Joseph de Grave argued that the Underworld visited by Odysseus was the islands {{at the mouth of the}} river Rhine. A more extreme view, that the whole geography of the Iliad and the Odyssey can be mapped on the coasts of the northern Atlantic, occasionally surfaces. According to this, Troy is in southern England, Telemachus's journey is in southern Spain, and Odysseus was wandering the Atlantic coast. Finally, a recent publication argues that Homeric geography is to be found in the sky, and that the Iliad and the Odyssey can be decoded as a star map.|$|R
