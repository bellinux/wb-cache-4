25|$|Maugham, by then in his sixties, {{spent most}} of the Second World War in the United States, first in Los Angeles (he worked on many scripts, {{and was one of the}} first authors to make {{significant}} money from film adaptations) and later in the South.

After his companion Gerald Haxton died in 1944, Maugham moved back to England. In private, Maugham espoused antisemitic conspiracy theories about Jewish refugees, noting that ‘the Gestapo is known to have had spies among refugees, and these have not seldom been Jews’.

25|$|In 1933, {{once the}} Nazi Party had reached power, Klemperer left Germany {{and moved to}} the United States. He had {{previously}} converted to Catholicism, but returned to Judaism {{at the end of his}} life. In the <b>U.S.</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> appointed Music Director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. He was granted United States citizenship in 1937. In Los Angeles, he began to concentrate more on the standard works of the Germanic repertoire that would later bring him greatest acclaim, particularly the works of Beethoven, Brahms and Gustav Mahler, though he gave the Los Angeles premieres of some of fellow Los Angeles resident Arnold Schoenberg's works with the Philharmonic. He also visited other countries, including England and Australia. While the orchestra responded well to his leadership, Klemperer had a difficult time adjusting to Southern California, a situation exacerbated by repeated manic-depressive episodes, reportedly as a result of severe cyclothymic bipolar disorder. He also found that the dominant musical culture and leading music critics in the United States were largely out of sympathy with his taste for modern music from Weimar's Golden Age, and he felt he was not properly valued.|$|E
