It is shown, by way of analytical derivation and simulations, that uniform distribution produces power spectrum comparable to those generated by other relatively more complex distributions <b>under</b> <b>studied.</b> Significantly, it means that uniform distribution, which is the simplest to implement, is the preferred probability law for randomization in a RPWM scheme...|$|R

FLT3 internal tandem duplications (ITDs) {{have been shown to}} confer a poorer prognosis in AML with normal cytogenetics. Several FLT3 inhibitors have undergone clinical trials, with mixed results. Two other mutations - NPM1 and biallelic CEBPA are associated with improved outcomes, especially in people with normal cytogenetics and are used in current risk stratification algorithms.|$|E
