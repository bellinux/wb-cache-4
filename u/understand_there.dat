I think this is an immensely difficult area, the relationship between what happens with these games and its impact on young people. I've no doubt this debate will go on for a significant period of time, but I do agree. I think it is important that people <b>understand</b> <b>there</b> is a wider social responsibility as well as an interior responsibility for profits." ...|$|E

I wanted to show that creators are not limited, that they have many options for different (animation) styles to create stories." ...|$|E

Street flooding in Lake Charles was severe, though only a few houses suffered flood damage. To the south of Lake Charles, minor damage was reported in Cameron Parish, totaling to about $500,000 (1982USD). However, due to high tides, damage along the coastal areas of that parish was considerable. A Cameron Parish official noted [...] "There's power {{out all over the}} place, and we <b>understand</b> <b>there</b> was quite a bit of damage at Holly Beach". In Evangeline Parish, an F2 tornado on the Fujita Scale destroyed four buildings and damaged seven other structures. In northeastern Louisiana, wind damage was [...] "spotty" [...] and limited to downed trees and powerlines. As a result of heavy rainfall in that portion of the state, low-lying areas flooded, and bayous overflowed. A tornado, rated at F3, destroyed eleven houses and one church in Clayton. In addition, the tornado knocked down trees and powerlines in the area. Overall, damage in Louisiana was near $1million (1982USD).|$|E

500|$|On 29 September 1939, {{soon after}} the start of the war, Godfrey {{circulated}} a memorandum that, [...] "bore all the hallmarks of... Lieutenant Commander Ian Fleming", according to historian Ben Macintyre. It was called the Trout Memo and compared the deception of an enemy in wartime to fly fishing. The memo contained a number of schemes to be considered for use against the Axis powers to lure U-boats and German surface ships towards minefields. Number 28 on the list was an idea to plant misleading papers on a corpse that would be found by the enemy; the suggestion is similar to Operation Mincemeat, the successful 1943 plan to conceal the intended invasion of Italy from North Africa, although that idea was developed by Charles Cholmondoley in October 1942. The recommendation in the Trout Memo was titled: [...] "A Suggestion (not a very nice one)", and continued: [...] "The following suggestion is used in a book by Basil Thomson: a corpse dressed as an airman, with despatches in his pockets, could be dropped on the coast, supposedly from a parachute that has failed. I <b>understand</b> <b>there</b> is no difficulty in obtaining corpses at the Naval Hospital, but, of course, {{it would have to be}} a fresh one." ...|$|E
