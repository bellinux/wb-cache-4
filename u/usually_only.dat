5|$|A California {{hurricane}} is {{a tropical}} cyclone {{that affects the}} state of California. <b>Usually,</b> <b>only</b> the remnants of tropical cyclones affect California.

5|$|Although {{not much}} {{is known about}} Maya scribes, some did sign their work, both on {{ceramics}} and on stone sculpture. <b>Usually,</b> <b>only</b> a single scribe signed a ceramic vessel, but multiple sculptors {{are known to have}} recorded their names on stone sculpture; eight sculptors signed one stela at Piedras Negras. However, most works remained unsigned by their artists.|$|E

5|$|In some cases, {{travelling}} through unmapped areas, {{men took}} {{up to six}} weeks just to reach their destinations. They often had to carry all their supplies, arms and their radio, often {{with the help of}} Papuan carriers. Teams of two or three spotters typically maintained the stations, each led by an acting non-commissioned-officer (NCO), working in isolation from friendly forces in remote locations for extended periods of time. The teams survived on limited rations, usually supplemented by native food sources. Once their initial supplies were expended they usually had to fend for themselves, although stations were also sometimes re-supplied by airdrop or by sea, but <b>usually</b> <b>only</b> {{in the event of a}} failure of mission essential equipment, or when petrol for the radios ran low. Spotting stations were <b>usually</b> <b>only</b> lightly armed, being usually equipped with just one Owen Gun with 600 rounds for the NCO in charge, and a rifle with only 50 rounds for each other man.|$|E
5|$|Liver {{dysfunction}} as {{a result}} of malaria is uncommon and <b>usually</b> <b>only</b> occurs in those with another liver condition such as viral hepatitis or chronic liver disease. The syndrome is sometimes called malarial hepatitis. While it has been considered a rare occurrence, malarial hepatopathy has seen an increase, particularly in Southeast Asia and India. Liver compromise in people with malaria correlates with a greater likelihood of complications and death.|$|E

5|$|Since ancient times, the mallard {{has been}} eaten as food. The wild mallard was eaten in Neolithic Greece. <b>Usually,</b> <b>only</b> the breast and thigh meat is eaten.

5|$|The {{aquifers}} of shallow wells with depths varying from , yielding {{little more}} than 2 cubic metres/hour (71 cu ft), vary widely in availability. Deeper aquifers offer larger quantities of water, but its quality is generally brackish. The wadis are generally dry, <b>usually</b> <b>only</b> inundated after rainfall.|$|E
5|$|The {{duration}} of the pandemic and the war could have also played a role. The disease would <b>usually</b> <b>only</b> affect a certain area for a month before leaving, while the war, which most had initially expected to end quickly, had lasted for four years {{by the time the}} pandemic struck. This left little time for the disease to {{have a significant impact on}} the economy.|$|E

5|$|Treatment {{is based}} on the {{severity}} of poisoning from the bite; the majority of cases do not require medical care, and patients with localised pain, swelling and redness <b>usually</b> <b>only</b> require local application of ice and simple oral analgesia such as paracetamol. Pressure immobilisation of the wound site is not recommended. Keeping the victim still and calm is beneficial.|$|E
5|$|According to a 2006 study, the Noronha skink is {{infected}} by several parasitic worms, most frequently by the nematode Spinicauda spinicauda. Another nematode, Moaciria alvarengai, is much rarer. Other rare parasites include two trematodes—Mesocoelium monas and an undetermined species of Platynossomum—and an undetermined species of Oochoristica, a cestode. S.spinicauda is <b>usually</b> <b>only</b> found in teiid lizards; {{it may have}} entered the archipelago when Tupinambis merianae, a teiid, {{was introduced to the}} island in 1960. Among nematodes, previous studies in 1956 and 1957 had only reported M.alvarengai and Thelandros alvarengai from the skink; the presence of S.spinicauda could explain the rarity of M.alvarengai and absence of T.alvarengai in Noronha skinks observed in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Ambulance Care Assistant – Have {{varying levels}} of {{training}} across the world, but these staff are <b>usually</b> <b>only</b> required to perform patient transport duties (which can include stretcher or wheelchair cases), rather than acute care. Dependent on provider, they may be trained in first aid or extended skills such as use of an AED, oxygen therapy and other lifesaving or palliative skills. They may provide emergency cover when other units are not available, or when accompanied by a fully qualified technician or paramedic.|$|E

5|$|Approximately 1 {{percent of}} tornadoes rotate in an {{anticyclonic}} {{direction in the}} northern hemisphere. Typically, systems as weak as landspouts and gustnadoes can rotate anticyclonically, and <b>usually</b> <b>only</b> those which form on the anticyclonic shear side of the descending rear flank downdraft (RFD) in a cyclonic supercell. On rare occasions, anticyclonic tornadoes form {{in association with the}} mesoanticyclone of an anticyclonic supercell, {{in the same manner as}} the typical cyclonic tornado, or as a companion tornado either as a satellite tornado or associated with anticyclonic eddies within a supercell.|$|E
5|$|Birth {{usually takes}} place in the water and {{typically}} produces a single pup weighing 1.4 to 2.3kg (3 to 5lb). Twins occur in 2% of births; however, <b>usually</b> <b>only</b> one pup survives. At birth, the eyes are open, ten teeth are visible, and the pup has a thick coat of baby fur. Mothers have been observed to lick and fluff a newborn for hours; after grooming, the pup's fur retains so much air, the pup floats like a cork and cannot dive. The fluffy baby fur is replaced by adult fur after about 13 weeks.|$|E
5|$|Broaching was {{originally}} developed for machining internal keyways. However, {{it was soon}} discovered that broaching is very useful for machining other surfaces and shapes for high volume workpieces. Because each broach is specialized to cut just one shape, either the broach must be specially designed for the geometry of the workpiece or the workpiece must be designed around a standard broach geometry. A customized broach is <b>usually</b> <b>only</b> viable with high volume workpieces, because the broach can cost US$15,000 to US$30,000 to produce.|$|E

5|$|Distinguished Maya warriors entered battle wearing armour. The {{upper body}} {{was covered by}} a short jacket that was filled with rock salt, and the forearms and legs were {{protected}} with tight bindings of cloth or leather. The salt-packed cotton armour was tough enough that even arrows could not penetrate it. Armour could be decorated and was often adorned with feathers. Commoners did not wear armour in battle, <b>usually</b> <b>only</b> wearing a loincloth and warpaint. Warriors carried shields made from two right-angled wooden bars with deerskin stretched across them.|$|E
5|$|Distributed element {{filters are}} used {{in many of the}} same {{applications}} as lumped element filters, such as selectivity of radio channel, bandlimiting of noise and multiplexing of many signals into one channel. Distributed element filters may be constructed to have any of the bandforms possible with lumped elements (low-pass, band-pass, etc.) with the exception of high-pass, which is <b>usually</b> <b>only</b> approximated. All filter classes used in lumped element designs (Butterworth, Chebyshev, etc.) can be implemented using a distributed element approach.|$|E
5|$|Mild steel corrodes {{more readily}} than wrought iron, but is cheaper and more widely available. Carbon steel {{contains}} 2.0% carbon or less, with small amounts of manganese, sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon. Alloy steels contain varying amounts of carbon {{as well as other}} metals, such as chromium, vanadium, molybdenum, nickel, tungsten, etc. Their alloy content raises their cost, and so they are <b>usually</b> <b>only</b> employed for specialist uses. One common alloy steel, though, is stainless steel. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.|$|E
