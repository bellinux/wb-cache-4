40|$|AbstractWe {{investigated}} the antimicrobial effects of Urechistachykinins I <b>and</b> II (<b>UI</b> <b>and</b> UII) and their modes of action. <b>UI</b> <b>and</b> UII showed antimicrobial activities without a hemolytic effect. To investigate the mechanism(s) of <b>UI</b> <b>and</b> UII, cellular localization was examined. Confocal microscopy {{results showed that}} peptides were located in the cell envelope. To elucidate the physical changes of membrane induced by <b>UI</b> <b>and</b> UII in Candida albicans, flow cytometry analyses were performed by using bis-(1, 3 -dibutylbarbituric acid) trimethine oxonol, and changes in membrane dynamics were assessed using 1, 6 -diphenyl- 1, 3, 5 -hexatriene. The results suggest that <b>UI</b> <b>and</b> UII may exert their antimicrobial effect by disrupting the cell membranes...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the {{association}} between urinary incontinence (<b>UI)</b> <b>and</b> the main clinical and serological subsets of SSc, to assess risk factors for <b>UI</b> <b>and</b> its impact on quality of life (QoL). METHODS: <b>UI</b> <b>and</b> QoL were assessed through self-administered questionnaires in 334 patients with SSc from five European tertiary centres. Logistic regressions were performed to test the association between clinical forms, serological status <b>and</b> <b>UI</b> <b>and</b> to adjust for confounders. Further independent predefined SSc risk factors for UI were tested through a multivariable logistic model. RESULTS: The prevalence of UI was 63...|$|R

40|$|This paper uses data {{gathered}} as {{part with the}} Child Support Demonstration Evaluation (CSDE) to examine {{the extent to which}} administrative (<b>UI)</b> <b>and</b> survey records on earnings are congruent. To the extent that disparities exist between <b>UI</b> <b>and</b> survey records we examine whether these disparities can be explained by differences in the definition of earnings or method of data collection. We also examine implications of differences in the recording of earnings between <b>UI</b> <b>and</b> survey sources on measuring employment, earnings growth, and poverty among low-skill women...|$|R

We obtain their limit distributions under the null hypothesis of no {{change in the}} mean. Under alternative hypothesis our statistics can detect very short epidemics of length logγ n, γ> 1. Using self-normalization and adaptiveness to modify <b>UI</b> <b>and</b> DI, allows us to prove the same results under very relaxed moment assumptions. Trimmed versions of <b>UI</b> <b>and</b> DI are also studied...|$|R

40|$|Fish urotensin I (UI), {{a member}} of the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) family of peptides, is a potent {{inhibitor}} of food intake in mammals, yet the role of UI in the control of food intake in fish is not known. Therefore, to determine the acute effects of UI on appetite relative to those of CRH, goldfish were given intracerebroventricu-lar (i. c. v.) injections of carp/goldfish <b>UI</b> <b>and</b> rat/human CRH (0. 2 – 200 ng/g) and food intake was assessed for a 2 -hour period after the injection. <b>UI</b> <b>and</b> CRH both sup-pressed food intake in a dose-related manner <b>and</b> <b>UI</b> (ED 50 = 3. 8 ng/g) was significantly more potent than CRH (ED 50 = 43. 1 ng/g).
