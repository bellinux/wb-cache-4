The multi-point optic fibre sensor is made of a serial array of weak-reflectivity identical gratings. The weak-reflectivity identical gratings form the interferometric cavities <b>UV</b> <b>printed</b> on the single mode fibre. The ability to measure temperatures changes at different cavities along the serial array is particularly interesting for the monitoring of power transformers, high temperature furnaces and jet engines. Changes in temperature in each respective cavity is measured based on the spectral shift in the phase of the light from each respective cavity. The performance of the multi-point fibre sensor system is evaluated. Further, a theoretical and experimental investigation of a serial array composed of two cavities of different lengths is conducted. This investigation is aimed at measuring {{the impact of the}} overlap of the two distinct cavities in their respective frequency domain and determining the accuracy of the measurement.

40|$|A facile in situ and <b>UV</b> <b>printing</b> {{process was}} {{demonstrated}} to create self-cleaning synthetic replica of natural petals and leaves. The process {{relied on the}} spontaneous migration of a fluorinated acrylate surfactant (PFUA) within a low-shrinkage acrylated hyperbranched polymer (HBP) and its chemical immobilization at the polymer-air interface. Dilute concentrations of 1 wt. % PFUA saturated the polymer-air interface within 30 min, leading to a ten-fold increase of fluorine concentration at the surface compared with the initial bulk concentration and a water contact angle (WCA) of 108 °. A 200 ms flash of UV light was used to chemically crosslink the PFUA at the HBP surface prior to <b>UV</b> <b>printing</b> with a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) negative template of red and yellow rose petals and lotus leaves. This flash immobilization hindered the reverse migration of PFUA within the bulk HBP upon contacting the PDMS template, and enabled to produce texturized surfaces with WCA well above 108 °. The synthetic red rose petal was hydrophobic (WCA of 125 °) and exhibited the adhesive petal effect. It was not superhydrophobic due to insufficient concentration of fluorine at its surface, {{a result of the}} very large increase of the surface of the printed texture. The synthetic yellow rose petal was quasi-superhydrophobic (WCA of 143 °, roll-off angle of 10 °) and its self-cleaning ability was not good also due to lack of fluorine. The synthetic lotus leaf did not accurately replicate the intricate nanotubular crystal structures of the plant. In spite of this, the fluorine concentration at the surface was high enough and the leaf was superhydrophobic (WCA of 151 °, roll-off angle below 5 °) and also featured self-cleaning properties...|$|E

The alarm {{concerning}} the detection of a photoinitiator, 2 -isopropyl thioxanthone (ITX), in food samples packed with cartons printed with UV-cured inks has focused the attention of legislative authorities on the potential migrants from packaging inks into foods. For this reason {{it is very important to}} carry out analytical methods for the detection of those compounds in food as potential migrants from packaging. The aim of the present work was to develop a multimethod for the analysis of 6 photoinitiators in milk. The selected photoinitiators were Irgacure 184, benzophenone, Irgacure 651, Irgacure 907, Quantacure ITX, and Quantacure EHA (2 -ethylhexyl- 4 -dimethylaminobenzoate). Milk (10 mL) extraction was carried out by using ammoniac and hexane. The supernatant was evaporated and the residue was redissolved with acetonitrile. Then, the extract was analyzed by HPLC-UV. Calibration lines were carried out over the concentration range of 0. 1 to 10 mg/L. The calibration data presented high correlation coefficients (> 0. 9999).
