500|$|Quantum of Solace {{was chosen}} as the title of the 22nd Bond film; none of the story was used for the film's plot. Daniel Craig, who starred as Bond in the film, said the film also shares the primary {{thematic}} element of the story as [...] "it relates to the fact that if you don't have that Quantum of Solace in a relationship, you should give <b>up.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> are not respecting each other, it's over, {{and at the end of}} the last movie Bond doesn't have that because his girlfriend has been killed." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Minogue {{mentioned}} that [...] "Better than Today" [...] {{would be the}} last single to be released from Aphrodite, [...] "Put Your Hands <b>Up</b> (<b>If</b> <b>You</b> Feel Love)" [...] was released as the fourth and final single from the album, on 29 May 2011. The single managed to reach the top 50 in Australia, peaking at number 50 on the singles chart. It peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart, thus becoming the fourth single from Aphrodite to peak atop the chart. No official music video for the single was commissioned, although a lyric video for a remixed version of the song by Pete Hammond was released.|$|E

500|$|Anna Popplewell as Susan Pevensie, {{the second}} oldest Pevensie. Popplewell had been {{disappointed}} she barely used her {{bow and arrow}} in the first film. Adamson convinced Douglas Gresham to have her present during the battles by suggesting her passive role in the novel indicated Lewis' view of women before he met Joy Gresham. [...] "I think [...] cast women down in the earlier books, {{but when you look}} at The Horse and His Boy, it has a strong female character. Doug's mother was a strong woman." [...] Adamson also chose to have her fall for Caspian, because [...] "The kids are growing <b>up.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> look at Ben and you look at Anna, it seems really implausible that they wouldn't have some feelings for each other." [...] He knew it had to be [...] "sensitively handled" [...] though, and ultimately it is not about romance, but [...] " [...] the fact that you can have a wondrous experience, enjoy it and move on". Popplewell added that it would not make sense for the Narnians not to use Susan, a talented archer, in battle, and that the romance contributed to her character's reconciliation with losing Narnia in the first place.|$|E
500|$|Four singles were {{released}} from Aphrodite. Its lead single [...] "All the Lovers" [...] was a commercial success, peaking at number {{three in the}} United Kingdom and reaching the top ten in numerous countries like France, Italy, Scotland and Spain. In Australia, it narrowly missed the top ten by peaking at number 13 on the singles chart. [...] "Get Outta My Way" [...] was released as the second single and reached the top 20 in the United Kingdom, but underperformed in Australia after failing to peak inside the top 50. Similarly, the third single [...] "Better than Today" [...] missed the top 50 in Australia, and additionally missed the top 20 in the United Kingdom. In response to their poor chart performances, Minogue expressed disappointment in her label and stated that no further singles would be released. Despite this statement, [...] "Put Your Hands <b>Up</b> (<b>If</b> <b>You</b> Feel Love)" [...] was released as the fourth and final single from Aphrodite and peaked at number 50 in Australia. In the United States, all four singles released from the album peaked atop the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart. To further promote the album, Minogue embarked on the successful [...] in 2011.|$|E
500|$|American critic Robert Christgau {{gave the}} album a [...] "neither" [...] rating, {{indicating}} an album that [...] "may impress {{once or twice}} with consistent craft or an arresting track or two. Then it won't". A negative review came from Rolling Stone, who gave the album two stars out of five, labelling the album [...] "utterly disappointing" [...] and blaming producer Nellee Hooper, suggesting he [...] "sabotaged a ferociously iconoclastic talent with a phalanx of cheap electronic gimmickry." [...] Michele Romero of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a C, saying, [...] "On a few songs, [...] breathy mewl is a pleasant contrast to the mechanical drone of Sugarcube-like techno-tunes. But most of Debut sounds annoyingly like the monotonous plinking of a deranged music box. Wind it <b>up</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> like -- eventually it will stop." [...] Debut rated highly in British end of year polls. The NME ranked Debut at number one on their list of [...] "Top 50 LPs of 1993". Melody Maker placed the album at number six on their list of [...] "Albums of the Year for 1993" [...] calling it [...] "a fantastic debut". In 1994, Q included the album on their list for top fifty albums of 1993. Björk reacted to the positive reviews hesitantly, stating that if she'd [...] "delivered exactly the same album and I came from Nottingham, I'd have got completely different reviews, normal down-to-earth ones" [...] and that Debut [...] "was {{a bit of a}} rehearsal and it's really not that good. I can do much better." ...|$|E

500|$|Billed by {{her record}} label Parlophone as her {{comeback}} album, Aphrodite {{is a celebration}} of Minogue's [...] "dance-floor roots", and is primarily a dance-pop and disco album. Its title alludes to the Greek goddess of love, beauty, pleasure, and procreation. [...] "All the Lovers", {{one of the last}} tracks to be recorded for the album, is a [...] "squiggly" [...] electropop-influenced disco song written by Jim Eliot and Mima Stilwell, who had previously collaborated with Minogue on [...] "2 Hearts", the lead single from X. It is similar to Minogue's 2004 single [...] "I Believe in You", but has a [...] "more danceable edge", and features a [...] "gauzy, heartbeat rhythm" [...] and 1980s-stylised synthesiser riffs. The song was met with critical acclaim from music critics and was frequently commended for its production and chorus. The second track [...] "Get Outta My Way" [...] combines electronic music and bubblegum pop with disco elements. The song focuses on a [...] "frustrated and furious" [...] Minogue delivering [...] "wispy" [...] vocals in a form of a warning to her uncaring partner, indicating that she may leave him and start [...] "grinding away with another chap". Its lyrical content is suggestive in nature. The song received generally favourable reviews from music critics and was complimented for its musical composition and subject matter. [...] "Put Your Hands <b>Up</b> (<b>If</b> <b>You</b> Feel Love)" [...] is a hi-NRG-influenced club song. Receiving mixed critical reviews, its lyrics were criticised for being clichéd although one critic named it a [...] "concert hit waiting to happen." [...] "Closer" [...] takes a darker and more atmospheric approach, featuring [...] "sighing background vocals and spiralling harpsichord-esque synths." [...] Critics felt {{that it was one of}} the more interesting and experimental songs of the album.|$|E
2500|$|The rivalry also {{manifests itself}} {{in the fact that}} many Scottish people support England's opponents and vice versa, despite the fact that England and Scotland are both {{countries}} of the United Kingdom. Whether Scots should support England against other national teams is routinely a matter of heated debate. Some Scotland fans sing, [...] "Stand <b>up</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> hate England" [...] and, [...] "If you hate the fucking English, clap your hands", while some English fans reciprocate these sentiments with, [...] "Stand <b>up</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> hate Scotland" [...] and, [...] "I’d rather be a Paki than a Jock". However, the phenomenon of Scots wishing England well in international tournaments is not unknown, with a survey {{on the eve of the}} 2002 World Cup finding that one Scot in three intended to support England, while only one in six intended to support England’s opponents. A survey before the 2010 World Cup found a more even divide, with 24% on each side. The largest group in both surveys did not offer an opinion either way.|$|E
2500|$|Before the 2000 European Championship, England and Germany {{had already}} been drawn {{together}} in the same qualifying group for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. England's home match against Germany was played on Saturday 7 October 2000, and was significant as it was the last international fixture ever to be played at the old Wembley Stadium, before it was demolished and rebuilt. England lost 1–0 to a German free kick scored by Dietmar Hamann. [...] "It was the last refuge of the inadequate. Half-time neared, England were a goal down and a sizeable section of the crowd sullied the ever-dampening occasion. 'Stand <b>up</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> won the War,' they sang", wrote journalist Ian Ridley in his match report for The Observer.|$|E

2500|$|In 1987, Denise [...] "Vanity" [...] Matthews {{claimed she}} {{was engaged to}} Sixx. In his book , he {{describes}} his relationship with her, [...] "Vanity came and went during different periods of my addiction. She was a wild black chick who had sung with Prince: she’d also been his lover for a while. At the time I thought of Vanity as a disposable human being, like a used needle. Once its purpose was fulfilled it {{was ready for the}} trash, only to be dug <b>up</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were really desperate…We became drug buddies: sometimes, you could even just about call us boyfriend and girlfriend. Vanity also taught me how to really freebase: the first time I based was with Tommy when Mötley just started and only a few times after that. So up until then, I’d been mostly snorting or injecting. But as soon as she showed me the real ins and outs of cooking up a good rock…it was love. Not her. The drug." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 16th {{season of}} The Simpsons has {{garnered}} generally positive reviews from critics, with many noting while the episodes are still good and funny {{they are of}} a lesser quality {{than those of the}} show's earlier seasons. CraveOnline gave the season a rating of 8.0 out of 10, and spoke highly of its [...] "little pieces of continuity", [...] "sharp parody", and [...] "non sequitur gags". Entertainment Focus gave it 4 out of 5 stars, concluding [...] "Some people have criticised The Simpsons claiming that the show is tired and has passed its prime. We don't agree with those people at all and think The Simpsons has been remarkably consistent in terms of its humour and stories. Sure it may have been eclipsed by the edgier Family Guy in more recent years but The Simpsons is, and always will be, one of the most original and talked-about shows. The Simpsons: Season 16 is another cracking instalment of the hit show and we still, after all these years, just can't get enough. High-Def Digest also gave a 4/5 star rating, saying [...] "As mentioned in the review, there are plenty of laughs to be had in this season, but very few of them come from a place that feels truly genuine and sincere. Sixteen seasons in, it seems that the show is a mixture of been-there-done-that sentiment and perfunctory punch lines. Aside from the so-so image, there's plenty here to keep the die-hard 'Simpsons' fan happy, so this one comes recommended for fans". Cinema Sentries said [...] "This is not something to pick <b>up</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are a general TV fan, or a casual Simpsons fan. The overall quality of the season is not high enough, and you may not get satisfactory enjoyment from them. If you sort of turned your back on the show, this probably isn't the season to check out. However, if you are a Simpsons devotee, then you will want to pick it up". DVDTalk wrote [...] "The Simpsons: Season Sixteen isn't the best of the series' run but it is a very strong collection of truly funny and frequently quite clever doses of animated comedic insanity." ...|$|E
