5|$|Approximately 600 Jews {{were killed}} in Greater Albania during the war. Albania-proper emerged from the war with a {{population}} of Jews eleven times greater than at the beginning, numbering around 1,800 individuals. Most of these subsequently emigrated to Israel, but several hundred remained <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of Communism in the early 1990s before they did the same. As of 2011, 69 Albanians have been recognized as Righteous Among the Nations for the role they played in saving Jews during the Holocaust.|$|E

5|$|Byzantine {{education}} {{was the product}} of an ancient Greek educational tradition that stretched back to the 5th century BC. It comprised a tripartite system of education that, taking shape during the Hellenistic era, was maintained, with inevitable changes, up <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of Constantinople. The stages of education were the elementary school, where pupils ranged from six to ten years, secondary school, where pupils ranged from ten to sixteen, and higher education.|$|E
5|$|Gaul never regained its Celtic identity, never {{attempted}} another nationalist rebellion, {{and remained}} loyal to Rome <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of the Western Empire in 476 AD. However, although Gaul itself was to thereafter remain loyal, cracks were {{appearing in the}} political unity of Rome's governing figures– partly over concerns over the loyalty of Caesar's Gallic troops to his person rather than the state– that were soon to drive Rome into a lengthy series of civil wars.|$|E
5|$|In early AD 41, Caligula {{was assassinated}} {{as a result}} of a {{conspiracy}} by officers of the Praetorian Guard, senators, and courtiers. The conspirators' attempt to use the opportunity to restore the Roman Republic was thwarted, however. On the day of the assassination of Caligula, the Praetorians declared Caligula's uncle, Claudius the next Roman emperor. Although the Julio-Claudian dynasty continued to rule the empire <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of Nero in AD 68, Caligula's death marked the official end of the Julii Caesares in the male line.|$|E

5|$|Writing around 1200, Niketas Choniates equated {{the office}} with the Western marshal, and {{it appears to have}} been used interchangeably with the latter title in the Latin Empire and the other Latin states formed after the Fourth Crusade. The office {{continued}} to exist during the Palaiologan period <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fall</b> of Constantinople in 1453. It remained one of the highest dignities of state, ranking eighth overall in the hierarchy, although from the late 13th century on, multiple persons could hold it.|$|E
5|$|As the Parliament {{buildings}} {{had been}} lent to the Universal Postal Union for its 14th congress, Diefenbaker {{was forced to}} wait <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> to convene Parliament. However, the Cabinet approved measures that summer, including increased price supports for butter and turkeys, and raises for federal employees. Once the 23rd Canadian Parliament was opened on October 14 by Queen Elizabeth II — {{the first to be}} opened by any Canadian monarch — the government rapidly passed legislation, including tax cuts and increases in old age pensions. The Liberals were ineffective in opposition, with the party {{in the midst of a}} leadership race after St. Laurent's resignation as party leader.|$|E

5|$|Caesar {{defeated}} large armies {{at major}} battles 58 and 57 BC. In 55 and 54 BC he made two expeditions into Britain, the first Roman to do so. Caesar then defeated {{a union of}} Gauls at the Battle of Alesia, completing the Roman conquest of Transalpine Gaul. By 50 BC, all of Gaul lay in Roman hands. Gaul never regained its Celtic identity, never attempted another rebellion, and, except for the Crisis of the Third Century, remained loyal to Rome <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of the empire in 476.|$|E

Marseille graduated from Jagdfliegerschule 5 with an outstanding evaluation on 18 July 1940 and was assigned to Ergänzungsjagdgruppe Merseburg, stationed at the airport in Merseburg-West. Marseille's unit was assigned to air defence duty over the Leuna plant from the outbreak of war <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of France.|$|E
5|$|Most of Shivaji's {{principal}} Brahmin {{officers were}} Deshasthas. Some important contributors were warriors like Neelkanth Sarnaik, Keso Narayan Deshpande, Rahuji Somanath, Balaji and Chimnaji Deshpande of Pune, Ragho Ballal Atre, Moropant Pingale, Annaji Dato Sabnis and Melgiri Pandit. At {{one point in}} the history of the Maratha Empire, seven out of eight Ashta Pradhan(Council of Eight Ministers) came from the community.Most importantly, all of the Peshwas during Shivaji's time were Deshastha. In 1713, Balaji Vishwanath Bhat, a Kokanastha brahmin was appointed as the fifth Peshwa and the seat of Peshwa remained in Konkanastha hands <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of the Maratha Empire. In order to obtain the loyalty of the locally powerful Deshastha Brahmins, the Konkanastha Peshwas established a system of patronage for Brahmin scholars.|$|E

2500|$|Medieval Christian {{cosmology}} shows {{its influence}} {{especially in the}} account of the creation of the universe as the manifestation of a sort of song sung by God with which <b>the</b> angels harmonize <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>fallen</b> angel introduces discord. St. Augustine's writings on music, as well as the extensive medieval tradition of the divine harmony—more familiar to us today in the notion of the [...] "music of the spheres"—served as bases for this telling of creation.|$|R
5|$|On June 19, 1900, the 1st Regiment (Marines) {{attempted}} {{to take the}} city of Tientsin and failed. Then, on June 23, the Regiment, {{under the command of}} Major Waller, entered Tientsin in their second attempt after a Japanese blew open a gate to allow the Chinese to escape. Private Silva, who was seriously wounded and two sailors, Navy Seaman Axel Westermark and Chief Machinist Emil Peterson, were awarded the Medal of Honor for their defense of the civilian compound (legation) at Peking– they defended the walled city from June 28 <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of the city which occurred on August 17.|$|E

5|$|The Commercial Import Program, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the Commodity Import Program (CIP), was an economic aid arrangement between South Vietnam and its main supporter, the United States.

The initiative was a trading plan {{that was designed to}} inject large amounts of American capital into the South Vietnamese economy to help fuel its industrialisation, growth and self-sufficiency, without incurring the high levels of inflation that would normally occur in such a drastic injection of money.|$|E

5|$|The emperor {{was at the}} {{pinnacle}} of Han society. He presided over the Han government but shared power with both the nobility and appointed ministers who came largely from the scholarly gentry class. The Han Empire was divided into areas directly controlled by the central government using an innovation inherited from the Qin known as commanderies, and a number of semi-autonomous kingdoms. These kingdoms gradually lost all vestiges of their independence, particularly following the Rebellion of the Seven States. From the reign of Emperor Wu (r.141–87 BC) onward, the Chinese court officially sponsored Confucianism in education and court politics, synthesized with the cosmology of later scholars such as Dong Zhongshu. This policy endured <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of the Qing dynasty in 1911 AD.|$|E
5|$|The emperor's {{political}} reforms were connected with {{his desire to}} conquer all of China and to legitimize himself as a Chinese emperor. The prospect of conquering southern China was cut short by Wanyan Liang's assassination. Wanyan Liang's successor, Emperor Shizong, was less enthusiastic about sinicization and reversed several of Wanyan Liang's edicts. He sanctioned new policies {{with the intent to}} slow the assimilation of the Jurchens. Shizong's prohibitions were abandoned by Emperor Zhangzong (r. 1189–1208), who promoted reforms that transformed the political structure of the dynasty closer to that of the Song and Tang dynasties.
