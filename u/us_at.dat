The measure passed, 83–2, with 15 abstentions and only Israel and the U.S. voting against it. Reagan again appointed Keyes to represent the <b>U.S.</b> <b>at</b> the 1985 Women's Conference in Nairobi.|$|E

5|$|As the P.1127 {{had been}} {{developed}} {{at a time of}} deep UK defense cuts, Hawker had to seek commercial funding, and significant engine development funding came from the U.S. Research assistance was also provided by U.S.; including a series of wind tunnel tests conducted by NASA's Langley Research Center using sub-scale models, which demonstrated acceptable flight characteristics. Hawker test pilot Hugh Merewether went to the <b>U.S.</b> <b>at</b> NASA's request to fly the Bell X-14. In March 1959, the company's board of directors (Hawker Siddeley then) decided to privately fund two P.1127 prototypes.|$|E
5|$|Hubbard {{was posted}} to the Office of the Cable Censor in New York City after {{returning}} to the <b>US</b> <b>at</b> the end of March 1942.

5|$|In 1979, {{problems}} with the export policy were becoming apparent. The Soviets continued to sell newer aircraft designs to their clients, placing allies of the <b>U.S.</b> <b>at</b> a disadvantage. Denied by the U.S., countries were turning to other vendors for modern fighters, notably France's Dassault Mirage 2000. Barry N. Blechman, Assistant Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, testified that the US reductions in foreign arms transfers had actually encouraged other nations and increased worldwide arms sales. At the same time, there was considerable pressure to provide a suitable aircraft for Taiwan.|$|E

5|$|While Ovid's {{retelling of}} the myth is the more famous version of the story, he had several ancient sources on which to rely before he {{finished}} the Metamorphoses in A.D. 8.

5|$|As the new-fangled Ford Model Ts {{and other}} early {{automobiles}} increasingly {{took to the}} roads in the 1920s, inland steamship lines in the U.S. initially resisted carrying automobiles on their boats.

The Depression and loss of business to improved highways took an increasing toll of many U.S. steamship lines in the 1930s, as historic companies such as the Fall River Line ceased operation in 1937, preceded by the Lake Champlain company, which was the oldest steamboat line in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>at</b> its demise in 1932.|$|E

5|$|Brock {{sent the}} twelve mutineers {{and the seven}} deserters to Quebec for court martial. The mutineers had planned to jail all the {{officers}} (save Sheaffe, who was to be killed) and to cross the Niagara River into the <b>U.S.</b> <b>at</b> Queenston. Seven soldiers were subsequently executed by firing squad. The mutineers testified that {{they were forced to}} such measures by the severity of Sheaffe's command. They said if they had continued under Brock's command, they would never have taken such action. Brock was evidently upset by the news that the conspirators had been shot. In a botched execution, the firing squad discharged their weapons at too long a distance, so that the condemned men were not killed instantly.|$|E
5|$|Harding made {{it clear}} when he {{appointed}} Hughes as Secretary of State that the former justice would run foreign policy, a change from Wilson's close management of international affairs. Hughes had to work within some broad outlines; after taking office, Harding hardened his stance on the League of Nations, deciding the U.S. would not join even a scaled-down version of the League. With the Treaty of Versailles unratified by the Senate, the U.S. remained technically at war with Germany, Austria, and Hungary. Peacemaking began with the Knox–Porter Resolution, declaring the <b>U.S.</b> <b>at</b> peace and reserving any rights granted under Versailles. Treaties with Germany, Austria and Hungary, each containing many of the non-League provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, were ratified in 1921.|$|E

Clam dip remained popular throughout the 1960s in the <b>U.S.,</b> <b>at</b> which time prepared manufactured clam dips were available in U.S. supermarkets. As salsa became more popular among American consumers, the popularity of clam dip declined.|$|E
