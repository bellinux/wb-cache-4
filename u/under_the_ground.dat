5|$|The subsoil {{contains}} a large water table which is alimented by the Vardar river and functions as an underground river. Under the table lies an aquifer contained in marl. The water table is 4 to 12 m <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and 4 to 144 m deep. Several wells collect its waters {{but most of}} the drinking water used in Skopje comes from a karstic spring in Rašče, located west of the city.|$|E
5|$|Seabird colonies {{are highly}} variable. Individual nesting sites can be widely spaced, as in an {{albatross}} colony, or densely packed {{as with a}} murre colony. In most seabird colonies, several different species will nest on the same colony, often exhibiting some niche separation. Seabirds can nest in trees (if any are available), on the ground (with or without nests), on cliffs, in burrows <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and in rocky crevices. Competition can be strong both within species and between species, with aggressive species such as sooty terns pushing less dominant species out of the most desirable nesting spaces. The tropical Bonin petrel nests during the winter to avoid competition with the more aggressive wedge-tailed shearwater. When the seasons overlap, the wedge-tailed shearwaters will kill young Bonin petrels {{in order to use}} their burrows.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} folk tales about the Sumatran rhino were {{collected}} by colonial naturalists and hunters from the mid-19th century to early 20th century. In Burma, the belief was once widespread that the Sumatran rhino ate fire. Tales described the fire-eating rhino following smoke to its source, especially campfires, and then attacking the camp. There was also a Burmese belief that {{the best time to}} hunt was every July, when the Sumatran rhinos would congregate beneath the full moon. In Malaya, it was said that the rhino's horn was hollow and {{could be used as a}} sort of hose for breathing air and squirting water. In Malaya and Sumatra, it was once believed that the rhino shed its horn every year and buried it <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> In Borneo, the rhino was said to have a strange carnivorous practice: after defecating in a stream, it would turn around and eat fish that had been stupefied by the excrement.|$|E

5|$|Cordyline australis {{is one of}} the few New Zealand {{forest trees}} that can recover from fire. It can renew its trunk from buds on the {{protected}} rhizomes <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> This gives the tree an advantage because it can regenerate itself quickly and the fire has eliminated competing plants. Cabbage tree leaves contain oils which make them burn readily. The same oils may also slow down the decay of fallen leaves, so that they build up a dense mat that prevents the seeds of other plants from germinating. When the leaves do break down, they form a fertile soil around the tree. Cabbage tree seed also has a store of oil, which means it remains viable for several years. When a bushfire has cleared the land of vegetation, cabbage tree seeds germinate in great numbers to make the most of the light and space opened up by the flames.|$|E

25|$|The {{land where}} the homes were being built {{was not part}} of the {{agreement}} between the school board and Hooker; thus, none of these residents knew the canal's history. There was no monitoring or evaluating of the chemical wastes stored <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Additionally, the clay cover of the canal which was supposed to be impermeable began to crack. The subsequent construction of the LaSalle Expressway restricted groundwater from flowing to the Niagara River. After the exceptionally wet winter and spring of 1962, the elevated expressway turned the breached canal into an overflowing pool. People reported having puddles of oil or colored liquid in yards or basements. There were 410 children in the school in 1978.|$|E
25|$|In the 3rd century BCE, Li Bing, an {{official}} of the expansionist and innovative Qin dynasty, in addition to organizing the Sichuan basin water control system at Dujiangyan, discovered that the salt pools which had been used for many centuries were actually fed from deep <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> the remnants of an ancient inland sea. He ordered first that the pools be made deeper, then that wells be dug, and eventually that narrower and more efficient shafts be sunk. By the end of the 2nd century CE, workers had devised a system of leather valves and bamboo pipes which drew up both brine and natural gas, which they burned to boil the brine (the technology they developed for the bamboo piping was eventually applied to household plumbing).|$|E

25|$|An archaeological {{investigation}} {{usually involves}} several distinct phases, {{each of which}} employs its own variety of methods. Before any practical work can begin, however, a clear objective {{as to what the}} archaeologists are looking to achieve must be agreed upon. This done, a site is surveyed to find out as much as possible about it and the surrounding area. Second, an excavation may take place to uncover any archaeological features buried <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> And, third, the data collected from the excavation is studied and evaluated in an attempt to achieve the original research objectives of the archaeologists. It is then considered good practice for the information to be published so that it is available to other archaeologists and historians, although this is sometimes neglected.|$|E
25|$|The {{mole plough}} allows {{underdrainage}} {{to be installed}} without trenches, or it breaks up deep impermeable soil layers that impede drainage. It is a very deep plough, with a torpedo-shaped or wedge-shaped tip, and a narrow blade connecting this to the body. When dragged through the ground, it leaves a channel deep <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> and this acts as a drain. Modern mole ploughs may also bury a flexible perforated plastic drain pipe as they go, making a more permanent drain– {{or they may be}} used to lay pipes for water supply or other purposes. Similar machines, so called pipe-and-cable-laying ploughs, are even used under the sea, for the laying of cables, as well as preparing the earth for side-scan sonar in a process used in oil exploration.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} in {{the characteristics of the}} nests within the Vespula vulgaris species. Aerial nests and nests that are very close {{to the surface of the}} ground have much thicker envelopes than those <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Because heat is less well insulated above the ground, the wasps build thick envelopes to prevent heat from escaping. Also, smaller nests have thicker envelopes than larger nests. This is mainly due to the fact that the amount of heat produced is proportional to the volume of the nest. The larger a nest is the better it will be in conserving the nest warmth. The optimal temperature of the nest is around 32°C. However, when the temperature rises above the optimal temperature (during hot days), the workers use their wings as fans to cool the nest down.|$|E

25|$|The {{mole plow}} allows {{underdrainage}} {{to be installed}} without trenches, or it breaks up deep impermeable soil layers which impede drainage. It is a very deep plow, with a torpedo-shaped or wedge-shaped tip, and a narrow blade connecting this to the body.

Modern mole plow may also bury a flexible perforated plastic drain pipe as they go, making a more permanent drain– {{or they may be}} used to lay pipes for water supply or other purposes. A simple check can be made to find if the subsoil is in the right condition for mole ploughing. Compact a tennis ball sized sample taken at moling depth by hand, then push a pencil through. If the hole remains intact without splitting the ball the soil is in an ideal condition for the mole plough.|$|E
25|$|Females are oviparous, {{with three}} to eleven rather large, {{leathery}} eggs being laid (four to six are most common). These are incubated by the female <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> (via a shivering motion), and hatch after 55 to 60 days. Sexual maturity is reached at 11–18 months for males, and 20–36 months for females. Age {{is only one}} factor in determining sexual maturity and ability to breed; weight is the second factor. Males breed at 600 g or more, but in captivity are often not bred until they are 800 g (1.7 lb), although in captivity, some males {{have been known to}} begin breeding at 300-400 g. Females breed in the wild at weights as low as 800 g though 1200 g or more in weight is most common; in captivity, breeders generally wait until they are no less than 1500g (3.3lb). Parental care of the eggs ends once they hatch, and the female leaves the offspring to fend for themselves.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{adventure}} tour sites is boating upward on the Chay River into primitive forests, as the river becomes sinuous with several waterfalls and whirlpools until tourists arrive at Tro Mong. This tour sites have been surveyed and included in local travel agents besides cave exploration tour. In Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng park, {{there is a}} 50 m-high waterfall, Chai Waterfall. There is a bull field called Ran Bo (Bull Field) because wild bulls usually comes and reproduce in mating season. There are also some interesting tourist attractions in this park like Nước Ngang ("Horizontal Spring"), a spring runs horizontally instead of vertically as usual; Ðá Nằm (Crouching Stone), a stone blockading a stream current; Chân Thớt (Chopping Board), a chopping-board-shaped stone. But above all, the most spectacular scene is this area is Nước Trồi (Surfacing Stream), a stream surfacing from the ground. Several streams here run for a long distance, then disappear <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> The provincial Centre for Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng's Ecotourism and Culture currently has 248 boats, creating jobs for 500 locals. Every boat has two trained boatmen earning VND70,000 per day. This income is relatively high for peasants in this province. This centre also launched a programme in 2000 to train former loggers to work as photographers taking pictures for tourists and about 300 former loggers are now doing this.|$|E
