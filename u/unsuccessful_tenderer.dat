40|$|This paper {{examines}} the optimal bidding and hedging decisions of a risk-averse firm that takes {{part in an}} international tender. The firm faces multiple sources of uncertainty: exchange rate risk, risk of an <b>unsuccessful</b> <b>tender,</b> and business risk. The firm is allowed to trade unbiased currency futures contracts to imperfectly hedge its contingent foreign exchange risk exposure. We show that the firm shorts less (more) of the unbiased futures contracts when its marginal utility function is convex (concave) {{as compared with the}} case that the marginal utility function is linear. We further show that the curvature of the marginal utility function plays a decisive role in determining the impact of currency futures hedging on the firm's bidding behavior. Sufficient conditions that ensure the firm bids more or less aggressively than in the case without hedging opportunities are derived. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{test the}} {{prediction}} that leverage is inversely associated with managerial entrenchment. We examine leverage levels and year-to-year changes {{for several hundred}} firms between 1984 and 1991. We find that leverage levels are positively related to CEO stock ownership and CEO stock option holdings, and negatively related to CEO tenure and board of directors size. While generally consistent with less entrenched CEOs pursuing more leverage, these results are subject to alternative interpretations. We therefore analyze year-to-year changes in leverage around exogenous shocks to corporate governance variables. We find that leverage increases after <b>unsuccessful</b> <b>tender</b> offers and “forced” CEO replacements, and under certain conditions after the arrival of major stockholders. These relations have greater magnitude when the sample is restricted to low-leverage firms, even when 80 % of firms are defined as low-leverage. The {{results are consistent with}} decreases in entrenchment leading to increases in leverage, and with the majority of firms having less debt than optimal. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{rationale}} behind interfirm tender offers by examining the returns realized by the stockholders of firms that were the targets of <b>unsuccessful</b> <b>tender</b> offers and firms that have made unsuccessful offers. Our {{results suggest that the}} permanent positive revaluation of the unsuccessful target shares [documented by Dodd and Ruback (1977) and Bradley (1980) ] is due primarily to the emergence of and/or the anticipation of another bid that would ultimately result in the transfer of control of the target resources. We also find that the rejection of a tender offer has differential effects on the share prices of the unsuccessful bidding firms depending upon whether the tender offer process results in a change in the control of target resources. On the basis of these results we conclude that acquisitions via tender offers are attempts by bidding firms to exploit potential synergies, not simply superior information regarding the `true' value of the target resources...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{rationale}} behind acquisitions through tender offers by examining <b>unsuccessful</b> <b>tender</b> offers from 1985 to 2010. Four hypotheses are tested: information, synergy, agency and hubris. The study follows the approach in Bradley, Desai and Kim (1983) (BDK) and builds on their analysis by implementing the recent methodological advances in long run analysis. The proportion of unsuccessful acquisitions has declined significantly from 20 percent in 1985 to 5 percent in 2010. Contrary to the evidence presented in BDK, the results support both the information and synergy hypotheses. The study also examines correlations among target gain, total gain and acquirer gain to differentiate between synergy, agency and hubris hypotheses. The results suggest that, in addition to synergy, agency considerations have become increasingly important in explaining the <b>unsuccessful</b> acquisitions via <b>tender</b> offers in our sample period. We find no {{evidence in support of}} the hubris hypothesis. Cross-sectional analysis shows that the intensity of M&A activity in the target's industry, pre-announcement price run-up in the target, firm size, and absence of a poison pill provision increase the likelihood of unsuccessful targets being acquired within 5 years of the initial bid. Additionally, this study also finds by comparing unsuccessful initial bidders to their counterpart winning rival bidders that, bidders of larger size, more growth opportunities, and bidders in unrelated industries to that of the target and in less active M&A industries, are more likely to succeed in acquiring the target...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This study {{seeks to}} analyze the {{differences}} between merger cancellations and three types of takeover failures: failures {{that are associated with}} targeted share repurchases (greenmail), failures in which the sole bidder simply withdraws the offer, and failures that are accompanied by a general share repurchase (buyback). Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses event study methods and regression analysis. Findings – The paper observes negative target stock price reactions around all types of takeover failures and merger cancellations. However, the cumulative effect of takeover attempts is positive, suggesting that even <b>unsuccessful</b> <b>tender</b> offers generate permanent gains to target firm shareholders, while the cumulative effect of canceled mergers is negative. Furthermore, the market reaction to greenmail-induced takeover failure announcements is no worse than that of voluntary withdrawals, suggesting that greenmail may play an efficient role in mitigating the effects of takeover bid withdrawals. Finally, while bidder wealth is destroyed in takeover failures, the effect of merger cancellations on bidders is considerably more devastating. Originality/value – The paper provides evidence of negative stock price reactions to all forms of merger failure. The paper also shows that the cumulative effect of all types of takeover failures is still positive: suggesting that being put into play is still beneficial overall but that canceled mergers destroy value for both targets and bidders. The paper shows that the market reaction to greenmail-induced failure announcements is no worse than other forms of failure. Finally, while there is an immediate downturn in target prices around a failure, the negative outcome is more severe for the bidders. Thus, the market sees that there was something useful about the anticipated change in corporate control, which was lost when it failed to be completed.
