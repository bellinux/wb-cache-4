The scattering of light by particulate impurities in air and other gases, and in liquids, is known today as the Tyndall Effect or Tyndall Scattering. In studying this scattering during the late 1860s Tyndall was a beneficiary of recent improvements in electric-powered lights. He also had the use of good light concentrators.

Scattering (sub-diffractive) particles can be observed perpendicularly with a microscope. This setup allowed the observation of particles with sizes smaller than the microscope's resolution and led to a Nobel prize for Zsigmondy in 1925.|$|E

50|$|The first {{application}} of this illumination scheme for fluorescence microscopy was published in 1993 by Voie et al. under the name orthogonal-plane fluorescence optical sectioning (OPFOS). for imaging of the internal structure of the cochlea. The resolution {{at that time was}} limited to 10 µm laterally and 26 µm longitudinally but at a sample size in the millimeter range. The OPFOS microscope used a simple cylindrical lens for illumination. Further development and improvement of the SPIM started in 2004. After this publication by Huisken et al. the technique found wide application and is still adapted to new measurement situations today (see above). Since 2010 a first <b>ultramicroscope</b> with fluorescence excitation and limited resolution and since 2012 a first SPIM are available commercially.

50|$|The {{technique}} {{is used in}} conjunction with an <b>ultramicroscope</b> and a laser illumination unit that together allow small particles in liquid suspension to be visualized moving under Brownian motion. The light scattered by the particles is captured using a CCD or EMCCD camera over multiple frames. Computer software is then used to track the motion of each particle from frame to frame. The rate of particle movement is related to a sphere equivalent hydrodynamic radius as calculated through the Stokes-Einstein equation. The technique calculates particle size on a particle-by particle basis, overcoming inherent weaknesses in ensemble techniques such as dynamic light scattering. Since video clips form the basis of the analysis, accurate characterization of real time events such as aggregation and dissolution is possible. Samples require minimal preparation, minimizing the time required to process each sample. Speculators suggest that eventually the analysis may be done in real-time with no preparation, e.g. when detecting the presence of airborne viruses or biological weapons.|$|E
5000|$|In the system, the {{particles}} {{to be observed}} are dispersed in a liquid or gas colloid (or less often in a coarser suspension). The colloid is placed in a light-absorbing, dark enclosure, and illuminated with a convergent beam of intense light entering from one side. Light hitting the colloid particles will be scattered. In discussions about light scattering, the converging beam is called a [...] "Tyndall cone". The scene is viewed through an ordinary microscope placed {{at right angles to}} the direction of the lightbeam. Under the microscope, the individual particles will appear as small fuzzy spots of light moving irregularly. The spots are inherently fuzzy because light scattering produces fuzzier images than light reflection. The particles are in Brownian motion in most kinds of liquid and gas colloids, which causes the movement of the spots. The <b>ultramicroscope</b> system {{can also be used to}} observe tiny nontransparent particles dispersed in a transparent solid or gel.|$|E

40|$|A {{computer}} controlled scanning <b>ultramicroscope</b> {{has been built}} {{to assist in the}} characterization of transparent crystals. The device measures the scattering of a focused He-Ne laser beam by crystalline defects.

From this data, contour maps or three dimensional perspective plots of the scattering regions of the crystal can be generated to assist in finding patterns of defects which might be correlated with perturbations in the growth process. The verified resolution of the present instrument is about 1 micrometer, which is limited by the minimum step of the stepper-motor driven translation stages, optical diffraction effects and the sensitivity of the detector at the laser light frequency. The instrument was used to build a database of defects patterns in commercial laboratory grown triglycine sulphate (TGS) crystals, and to map defects in a TGS crystal grown from aqueous solution during the flight of Spacelab 3.

40|$|It {{has been}} confirmed, that the {{classical}} method for counting hydrophobic particles {{by means of}} a slit <b>ultramicroscope,</b> was inaccurate. However if the apparent particle concentration is determined for different slit‐apertures, correct results can be obtained, by extrapolating to infinite aperture. This procedure is extremely tedious and time consuming. This lead us to propose a new method of counting, which is both more accurate and more rapid than the classical one. It does not need any statistical treatment of the experimental data. In fact every particle contained in a given volume is counted. The volume is so large that there are practically no concentration fluctuations. The particles are forced to pass one by one under the microscope.

40|$|INVESTIGATIONS of the {{vitreous}} body are beset with numerous technical difficulties.

Through the slit lamp and in fixed histological preparations (Lauber, 1936; Baurmann, 1926; Comberg, 1924; Duke-Elder, 1930), the human vitreous body appears as a structured mass.
