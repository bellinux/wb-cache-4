40|$|The {{business}} model and strategic position of Quebec's rural foundries {{at the beginning}} of the 20 th century is virtually unknown. Inferences have been made based on pictorial and oral data sources. This data reveals that successful rural foundries were, in essence, confined to producing and selling agricultural tools to local farmers on an as-needed basis, because large urban foundries were already mass-producing domestic and industrial objects. In contrast, <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>detailed</b> <b>accounting</b> records and advertising publications of three rural foundries over the 1900 to 1914 period provides a clearer picture of the production and of the clientele of those rural foundries. Analysis of these sources suggests that the strategic {{business model}} of rural foundries was much more elaborate than the existing literature posits. Rural owner-managers of the early 20 th century were sophisticated strategists, marketers, and operators...|$|R
40|$|Background. A lack of male {{circumcision}} {{has been associated}} with increased risk of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) acquisition in a number of studies, but questions remain as to whether confounding by behavioral practices explains these results. The objective {{of the present study was}} to model per–sex act probabilities of female-to-male HIV- 1 transmission (i. e., infectivity) for circumcised and uncircumcised men, by <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>detailed</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>of</b> sexual behavior in a population with multiple partnerships. Methods. Data were collected as part of a prospective cohort study of HIV- 1 acquisition among 745 Kenyan truck drivers. Sexual behavior with wives, casual partners, and prostitutes was recorded at quarterly follow-up visits. Published HIV- 1 seroprevalence estimates among Kenyan women were used to model HIV- 1 per–sex act transmission probabilities. Results. The overall probability of HIV- 1 acquisition per sex act was 0. 0063 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 0035 – 0. 0091). Female-to-male infectivity was significantly higher for uncircumcised men than for circumcised men (0. 0128 vs. 0. 0051;). The effect of circumcision was robust in subgroup analyses and across a wide rangePp. 04 of HIV- 1 prevalence estimates for sex partners. Conclusions. After accounting for sexual behavior, we found that uncircumcised men were at a 12 -fold increased risk of acquiring HIV- 1 per sex act, compared with circumcised men. Moreover, female-to-male infectivit...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this thesis}} were to {{determine}} the epidemiology of ALS in the Netherlands, {{to determine the}} familial aggregation of ALS with Parkinson disease (PD), dementia, and vascular diseases, and to determine the association between several environmental and lifestyle factors and risk for sporadic ALS. We studied this in a population-based case-control study in the Netherlands, which is called the Prospective ALS study the Netherlands (PAN). The Netherlands provide ideal circumstances for a population-based study, since it is a densely populated country with 16. 6 million inhabitants as of January 1, 2010 and an area of 41, 528 km 2, it has a well-developed infrastructure, and it has easy accessibility of health care to all inhabitants. Our study fulfilled the predefined criteria for a population-based case-control study to yield class I evidence on exogenous risk factors in sporadic ALS; i. e. {{a large number of}} newly diagnosed patients <b>using</b> multiple sources <b>of</b> cases ascertainment and with a diagnosis of ALS made applying established criteria, the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> randomly selected population-based and matched controls, high response rates, the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>detailed</b> questionnaires <b>accounting</b> for exposure for disease onset, the quantification of exposures, the blinding of persons gathering the data on diseases status to ensure the uniform effort to gather information equally from affected and unaffected individuals, the blinding of participants and individuals gathering the data as to the hypotheses being tested, and the meticulous attention to avoid recall bias and confounding...|$|R
40|$|Stars may be {{understood}} as self-gravitating masses of a compressible fluid whose radiative cooling is compensated by nuclear reactions or gravitational contraction. The understanding of their time evolution requires the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>detailed</b> models that <b>account</b> for a complex microphysics including that of opacities, equation of state and nuclear reactions. The present stellar models are essentially one-dimensional, namely spherically symmetric. However, the interpretation of recent data like the surface abundances of elements or the distribution of internal rotation have reached the limits of validity of one-dimensional models because of their very simplified representation of large-scale fluid flows. In this article, we describe the ESTER code, {{which is the first}} code able to compute in a consistent way a two-dimensional model of a fast rotating star including its large-scale flows. Compared to classical 1 D stellar evolution codes, many numerical innovations have been introduced to deal with this complex problem. First, the spectral discretization based on spherical harmonics and Chebyshev polynomials is used to represent the 2 D axisymmetric fields. A nonlinear mapping maps the spheroidal star and allows a smooth spectral representation of the fields. The properties of Picard and Newton iterations for solving the nonlinear partial differential equations of the problem are discussed. It turns out that the Picard scheme is efficient on the computation of the simple polytropic stars, but Newton algorithm is unsurpassed when stellar models include complex microphysics. Finally, we discuss the numerical efficiency of our solver of Newton iterations. This linear solver combines the iterative Conjugate Gradient Squared algorithm together with an LU-factorization serving as a preconditionner of the Jacobian matrix.
