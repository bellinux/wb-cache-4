25|$|Attempts to {{regularize}} or {{reform the}} spelling of English have usually failed. However, Noah Webster popularized more phonetic spellings in the United States, such as flavor for British flavour, fiber for fibre, defense for defence, analyze for analyse, catalog for catalogue and so forth. These spellings already existed as alternatives, but Webster's dictionaries helped make them {{standard in the}} <b>US.</b> <b>See</b> American and British English spelling differences for details.|$|E
25|$|In {{the key of}} C major {{the first}} degree of the scale, called the tonic, is the note C itself, so a C major chord, a triad built on the note C, may be called the one chord of that key and notated in Roman numerals as I.

This {{numbering}} lets <b>us</b> <b>see</b> the job a chord is doing in the current key and tonality.|$|E

The Trickster creates disruptions of the status quo, maybe childlike and help <b>us</b> <b>see</b> the absurdity in situations, provide comic relief; e.g. Yoda in The Empire Strikes Back, Bugs Bunny and Brer Rabbit. The Child often innocent; could be someone childlike who needs protecting but may be imbued with special powers (e.g. E.T.). The Bad Father – often seen as a dictator type, or evil and cruel (e.g. Darth Vader in Star Wars). The Bad Mother (e.g. Mommie Dearest), along with evil stepmothers and wicked witches. The Bad Child; e.g., The Bad Seed, The Omen.|$|E
25|$|Many {{processes}} in a {{wastewater treatment plant}} are designed to mimic the natural treatment processes {{that occur in the}} environment, whether that environment is a natural water body or the ground. If not overloaded, bacteria in the environment will consume organic contaminants, although this will reduce the levels of oxygen in the water and may significantly change the overall ecology of the receiving water. Native bacterial populations feed on the organic contaminants, and the numbers of disease-causing microorganisms are reduced by natural environmental conditions such as predation or exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Consequently, in cases where the receiving environment provides a high level of dilution, a high degree of wastewater treatment may not be required. However, recent evidence has demonstrated that very low levels of specific contaminants in wastewater, including hormones (from animal husbandry and residue from human hormonal contraception methods) and synthetic materials such as phthalates that mimic hormones in their action, can have an unpredictable adverse impact on the natural biota and potentially on humans if the water is re-used for drinking water. In the US and EU, uncontrolled discharges of wastewater to the environment are not permitted under law, and strict water quality requirements are to be met, as clean drinking water is essential. (For requirements in the <b>US,</b> <b>see</b> Clean Water Act.) A significant threat in the coming decades will be the increasing uncontrolled discharges of wastewater within rapidly developing countries.|$|E

500|$|Eastman {{also points}} to Hazlitt's focus on the {{underlying}} unity of the plays. Hazlitt may not have done this as well as Coleridge (who, Eastman thought, was better at suggesting avenues of approach for others to find unity in Shakespeare's plays), [...] "Yet the demonstrations of unity in Cymbeline and Othello and King Lear make <b>us</b> <b>see</b> what otherwise we might not." [...] Eastman also rescues Hazlitt's political commentary, which, however abrasive it might be, [...] "opens such questions" [...] for general discussion, [...] "so that {{the politics of the}} plays enters into the arena of interpretation in a new and dignified way." ...|$|E
500|$|As the {{revolution}} progressed, rebel strength peaked at around 50,000 fighters. Despite their initial successes, the rebel leaders were seldom on good terms, and constant infighting plagued their camp. In {{the western part}} of the country, Jakov Nenadović was the principle figure. In the east, Milenko Stojković and Petar Dobrnjac held sway. The latter two opposed Karađorđe's attempts to create a centralized state, fearing that this would result in their own power being diminished. Others, such as Nenadović, complained that Karađorđe was becoming too authoritarian. Nenadović suggested that the rebels establish a central council to rein in Karađorđe's power and write up a constitution based on the rule of law. Karađorđe balked at the possibility. [...] "It's easy for this sovereign law of yours to rule in a warm room, behind this table," [...] he responded, [...] "but let <b>us</b> <b>see</b> tomorrow, when the Turks strike, who will meet them and beat them." ...|$|E
500|$|Madero also [...] {{earned the}} great displeasure of other revolutionaries, including, Pascual Orozco. Madero's first act after the treaty was signed was {{a gesture of}} {{reconciliation}} with the Díaz regime. As {{a result of the}} treaty he was given the right to appoint members of the la Barra cabinet. He chose mostly upper class Maderistas, including his wife for the post in the treasury. He also maintained the existing federal system, by keeping the sitting judges of the Supreme Court, the legislators in federal and state assemblies and the bureaucrats of the various federal agencies. Venustiano Carranza, who was going to become a major revolutionary in his own right and a future president of Mexico, stated that, after the treaty, Madero had [...] "deliver(ed) to the reactionaries a dead revolution which will have to be fought over again". Díaz, after leaving for exile in France, observed that [...] "Madero has unleashed a tiger, let <b>us</b> <b>see</b> if he can control him".|$|E

500|$|On March 13, Kristin Dos Santos of E! {{confirmed}} that the series would be a spin-off with new characters, and not a remake. In order for the project {{to be ready for}} the network's [...] "upfront" [...] presentations to advertisers in May, casting began before the script was completed. The first actor to be cast was Dustin Milligan on April 1, followed by AnnaLynne McCord on April 14. Sachs found Milligan to be [...] "really funny", and changed Ethan to better represent his personality. McCord was cast because, according to Sachs, [...] "she's someone who is worldly, and there's a sophistication to her that's interesting". Actress and singer Hilary Duff was rumored to have been offered the part of Annie, but she told reports that it was [...] "not true". The role was eventually given to Shenae Grimes, who says she was raised watching the original series. Sachs and Judah had seen Grimes' work before and knew [...] "she had the acting chops", and she was cast after acting a dramatic scene which she [...] "just killed". Sachs stated, [...] "she can act, she's beautiful, and she can give this sweet cuteness (that lets <b>us</b> <b>see)</b> through her eyes into this world." ...|$|E
500|$|A Little More Personal (Raw) {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. The album holds {{a score of}} 50 out of 100 based on 9 critical reviews, according to the music review aggregator Metacritic. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album three stars out of five, saying, [...] "Lindsay Lohan clearly spells out her ambition in the title to her second album, A Little More Personal (Raw) -- she's going to shed the glitzy trappings of her debut, Speak, and dig down deep in her heart, letting feelings flood onto the page". Erlewine also stated that the album [...] "is far from being totally successful, it is an intriguing mash-up of heart and commerce. And it does suggest one thing that Speak never did: Lindsay Lohan may have an artistic vision as a recording artist, which is indeed a huge step forward". Entertainment Weekly 's Leah Greenblatt said, [...] "like so many pop records today, Personal has {{more than its share}} of filler, and like all teenagers, Lohan contradicts herself. [...] Perhaps Personal 's vulnerability is calculated, and its rawness a misnomer, or maybe she's really opening up. We'll probably never know. Lindsay may no longer be on the edge of 17, but being 19, troubled, and ridiculously famous can cut pretty deep, so props to her for letting <b>us</b> <b>see</b> her bleed — just a little".|$|E
500|$|Hersey {{began by}} making himself {{familiar}} {{with the work of}} writers already in the market who were capable of producing the kind of material Ralston wanted. [...] He soon concluded that the new magazine would have to include some reprinted stories alongside the original material. [...] The budget did not permit Hersey to pay rates that would attract top-quality writers, nor even to reprint the best-known stories of the kind he was looking for, and he was forced to use relatively unknown authors such as Perley Poore Sheehan and Robert W. Sneddon. [...] Hersey distributed a [...] "Notice to Writers" [...] that described what he was looking for: [...] "strange, bizarre, occult, mysterious tales... mystic happenings, weird adventures, feats of leger-de-main, spiritualism, et cetera... If you have an idea which you have considered too bizarre to write, too weird or strange, let <b>us</b> <b>see</b> it." [...] This did not restrict the submissions to fantasy or science fiction, and as a result Hersey received (and printed) all kinds of fiction, including mysteries, adventures, and love stories, though it may be that he simply did not receive enough good quality science fiction and fantasy to fill the magazine. [...] Hersey later recalled that the notice did not bring in many usable manuscripts: [...] "As a result of the notices in the writers' magazines, I received a thousand manuscripts but was able to buy only ten!" ...|$|E

500|$|... "And Then There Were Fewer" [...] {{received}} widespread acclaim from {{critics and}} viewers, with one critic calling the storyline [...] "solidly funny, well-plotted, and nearly perfectly executed". In a simultaneous {{review of the}} episodes of The Simpsons and The Cleveland Show that preceded the episode, The A.V. Clubs Todd VanDerWerff commented that he enjoyed [...] "the 'a bunch of people go to an isolated place and start getting killed' murder mystery subgenre", and that the episode [...] "made fun of the conceits of the genre". In the conclusion of his review VanDerWerff called the episode [...] "excellent and fun", and [...] "full of surprisingly gorgeous animation and a nicely creepy feel that hung over all of the jokes" [...] and rated it as a B+, the best rating between The Simpsons episode [...] "Elementary School Musical" [...] and The Cleveland Show episode [...] "Harder, Better, Faster, Browner". Jason Hughes of TV Squad also praised the episode's writers for doing a [...] "solid job of creating a genuine mystery throughout the hour, keeping us guessing as to who did it and what their motive may have been". Hughes went on to comment positively on the episode's numerous guest stars, and compared its portrayal of Diane Simmons to that of The Simpsons character Sideshow Bob. Natalie Zutter of Ology also praised the episode, calling it, [...] "Surprisingly, {{the best of the}} evening." [...] In the summary of her review, Zutter wrote that it was a [...] "fun murder mystery that lets <b>us</b> <b>see</b> all our favorite Quahog folks", while continuing to wonder whether the characters who were killed off would remain dead.|$|E
500|$|Mendelson {{called the}} trailer [...] "a {{textbook}} case for unnecessary second pitches...Is there anyone {{out there who}} watched that first teaser back in December and said 'Hmm, it looks good and all, but I need more evidence'?" [...] He added that he was [...] "a little disappointed by the big Spider-Man reveal," [...] having previously wondered, after a Spider-Man character poster was not released with the others, if Marvel would have the [...] "courage" [...] to not include the character in any marketing materials before the film's release, letting the [...] "Peter Parker scenes the film has to offer be something that is a surprise for theatrical moviegoers and/or something that drives post-opening weekend buzz". Mendelson's colleague at Forbes Mark Hughes felt differently, noting that the trailer was targeting the general audience rather than just fans by giving [...] "us more explanation [...] of why a clearly major battle is raging between Captain America and Iron Man", and by including Spider-Man since [...] "there are plenty of surprises in these movies, and since we all already know Spider-Man is in Civil War, refusing to let <b>us</b> <b>see</b> him would frankly be a bit weird and pointless ... it's common for average filmgoers to hear some final bit of information or see some final image and feel compelled, inspired, or otherwise driven {{to go out to}} the movies that day. There are any number of factors that can come into play...and the world needed to see [...] because it’s the sort of value-added element that can make [...] difference". Graeme McMillan of The Hollywood Reporter felt that the Spider-Man reveal [...] "alone makes the trailer", describing it as feeling [...] "like the comic book character come to life. That awkward, voice-cracking, 'hey everyone' was as humble, playing-it-cool and cocky as he should be." ...|$|E
