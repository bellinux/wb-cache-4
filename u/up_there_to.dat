Both of them are smart for doing that. The song came out hard. Mariah knew I {{wanted to do a}} song with her. It finally happened, and it turned out hard. I just flew <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> New York, went in the studio with her. I flew right out and went back on the road. When I do a song with people, I like to really get in the studio with them so I could feel they swag and they could feel mine. The music comes out better.|$|E

25|$|Stan {{returns home}} temporarily, but is sent into a hospice {{against his own}} will as his health {{continues}} to deteriorate. On Good Friday 2015, Dean returns to Albert Square alongside his father Buster Briggs (Karl Howman), insisting on visiting Stan at the hospital before he flees the country. Shirley calls the police to stop Dean leaving, and he is arrested for breaking his bail conditions, which saddens Stan. The following week, Stan attempts to bring his family together by asking Mick to make amends with Shirley, but although he tries, she refuses {{to show up at}} Stan and Cora's wedding ceremony. The ceremony is interrupted when Stan appears to be in pain, and the nurses give him pain relief. He promises Cora that they will marry the next day and she sleeps over in his room. Shirley also shows <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> be with {{him in the middle of}} the night, having had a change of heart after hearing of Jim Branning's (John Bardon) death. Stan's health rapidly deteriorates over the night, and the Carters and Cora keep a bedside vigil by his side. When Mick and Shirley argue, Stan advises them to make peace for his sake. Mick leaves while Shirley stays with Stan. Shirley reminisces the times she had with Mick when he was young. Stan hints to Shirley that she should put her family problems to rest, before dying peacefully.|$|E
500|$|When Gatski graduated, Sam Clagg, a {{teammate}} at Marshall, helped {{get him a}} tryout with the Cleveland Browns after contacting John Brickels, an assistant coach with West Virginia ties. The Browns were a new team in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) and were set to begin play in 1946. Gatski, who {{was working in the}} mines after graduating from Auburn, hitchhiked to Bowling Green, Ohio for the team's training camp. He did not consider a football career a certainty, and returning to the coal mines where his father had died in an accident was a distinct possibility. [...] "I didn't know what was going to happen," [...] he said later. [...] "I just went <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> see what would happen." ...|$|E
500|$|As the {{war began}} to wind down with Germany's {{surrender}} in May 1945, the team parlayed Brown's ties to college football and the military to build its roster. The first signing was Otto Graham, a former star quarterback at Northwestern University who was then serving in the Navy. The Browns later signed kicker and offensive tackle Lou Groza and wide receivers Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie. Fullback Marion Motley and nose tackle Bill Willis, two of the earliest African-Americans to play professional football, also joined the team in 1946. Cleveland's first training camp took place at Bowling Green University in northwestern Ohio. Brown's reputation for winning notwithstanding, joining the team was a risk; the Browns and the AAFC were nascent entities and faced tough competition from the NFL. [...] "I just went <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> see what would happen", center Frank Gatski said many years later.|$|E

500|$|The Great Depression {{was soon}} in full swing. and the {{department}} budget fell from $1000 to a mere $200. [...] It was during this time that Dr. Baker authored a number of books. Baker was an extremely gifted writer whose clear simple work helped him explain {{what was going on}} <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> an entire generation. In 1930, he authored the textbook Astronomy, followed in 1932 by The Universe Unfolding, and his revision of Simon Newcomb's Astronomy for Everyone. In 1934 Baker described an imaginary trip to the moon in When the Stars Come Out. His second textbook, An Introduction to Astronomy also appeared in 1934. Introducing the Constellation was published in 1937 and, with the help of Howard Zim in 1951, Stars: A Guide to the Heavens. His textbooks were used across the entire country for undergraduate astronomy courses and praised as classics.|$|E

[...] The Starkeeper tells Billy {{that the good}} he did in life {{was not enough to}} get into heaven, but so long as there is a person alive who remembers him, he can return for a day to try to do good to redeem himself. [...] He informs Billy that fifteen years have passed on Earth since the former barker's suicide, and {{suggests}} that Billy can get himself into heaven if he helps his daughter, Louise. [...] He helps Billy look down from heaven to see her (instrumental ballet: [...] "Billy Makes a Journey"). Louise has grown up to be lonely and bitter. [...] The local children ostracize her because her father was a thief and a wife-beater. [...] In the dance, a young ruffian, much like her father at that age, flirts with her and abandons her as too young. [...] The dance concludes, and Billy is anxious to return to Earth and help his daughter. [...] He steals a star to take with him, as the Starkeeper pretends not to notice.|$|E

[...] The young van Swieten was educated for national service in an elite Jesuit school, the Theresianum.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{this really}} {{was not a}} cliffhanger, {{the end of the}} fifth episode of the {{original}} Dallas miniseries saw J.R. go up to the loft of the barn to talk to Pam, who had gone <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> find her cousin Jimmy, after Digger had fallen off the wagon at the Ewing barbecue.

However, she {{does not want to be}} bothered, and, in trying to escape J.R., she falls from the loft, landing square on her stomach. Pam, who is pregnant, miscarries her unborn child. Later, Sue Ellen questions J.R. as to whether it was really an accident or did he mean for Pam to fall on purpose. J.R. says, [...] "I did not." [...] When Sue Ellen asks J.R. if he cares that Pam lost the baby, J.R. does not answer her, leaving it up to the viewer to decide.|$|E

By age 14, he had been arrested several times. He was nicknamed [...] "Tip" [...] after his paternal great-grandfather.

2500|$|Eggleston {{taught at}} Harvard in 1973 and 1974, {{and it was}} during these years that he {{discovered}} dye-transfer printing; he was examining the price list of a photographic lab in Chicago when he read about the process. As Eggleston later recalled: [...] "It advertised 'from the cheapest to the ultimate print.' The ultimate print was a dye-transfer. I went straight <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> look and everything I saw was commercial work like pictures of cigarette packs or perfume bottles but the colour saturation {{and the quality of}} the ink was overwhelming. I couldn't wait to see what a plain Eggleston picture would look like with the same process. Every photograph I subsequently printed with the process seemed fantastic and each one seemed better than the previous one." [...] The dye-transfer process resulted in some of Eggleston's most striking and famous work, such as his 1973 photograph entitled The Red Ceiling, of which Eggleston said, [...] "The Red Ceiling is so powerful, that in fact I've never seen it reproduced on the page to my satisfaction. When you look at the dye it is like red blood that's wet on the wall.... A little red is usually enough, but to work with an entire red surface was a challenge." ...|$|E
